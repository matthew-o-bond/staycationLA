50,ENCHANTING,"From the peacocks (male and noisy) to the waterfalls and turtles sunning themselves on flat rocks, the LAC Arboretum is a treat for the senses. And that's just the beginning. Towering trees covered in purple flowers, golden poppies, red bottle brush. The colors are vivid and arresting. We spent two hours in a world free of virus and worry, returning home refreshed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwaaak
40,Hidden Treasure in Arcadia,"Beautiful grounds and relaxing experience walking around the gardens. It was great exercise and enjoyable to see such nice trees, vegetation and flowers as well as bird life and turtles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomH232
50,best to go when it's not too hot,"One of my most favorite places to take a leisurely stroll, or or chill under a tree with a good book. The peacocks are everywhere and they do like putting on a show, but it's best to keep your distance, as they are wild and not always friendly. I love the rose garden and walking along the pond. At any given time you may also come across a film crew, as numerous commercials, TV, movies and music videos have been filmed there and still are. I don't reccomend going when it's hot because there is alot of walking involved if you really want to enjoy the whole arboretum experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastfixitmom
50,Sunday in the Park,This is a wonderful location to enjoy nature and just wonder around looking at beautiful things. There are so many ecosystems to enjoy. Its like visiting many different countries in one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931lorif

50,MOONLIGHT LANTERN FESTIVAL,"We visited this beautiful showcase of Chinese lanterns at night during the Christmas/New Years holiday. Just happened upon a flyer and thought we'd give it a try. It was a stunning showcase of culture. Some of the exhibits are interactive. There is a stage with Chinese acrobats performing. I don't know about the Botanic Garden, but if you're in or near Arcadia during this event, I recommend going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/respectthespoon
50,Great night light show,"Walking in this park is our regular activity. Started last year, this park offers night time light show in around October to January. The show features a lot of animals and CHINESE ancient city structure and characters. The dragon when lit up at night, the reflection in the lake makes the dragon come alive. There is also an acrobatic show right near the entrance of the park. Parking is bit difficult with all the crowds. But you can park at the mall parking lot and take a shuttle bus to the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34regisk
50,Moon Walk Light Festival,"We went for this light festival to walk through a wonderful fantasy land of lights showing dragons, fishes, butterflies, tigers and more. Food trucks. Chinese acrobats.

50,A walk in the park!,The LA Arboretum is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon or a quick walk. I have been going to the Arobretum for about 18 years. It is different in every season and they continue to change some of the pathways so you can discover new things in the garden.They are not only a peaceful garden. Many evenings they have concerts which are fun to go to with friends and a picnic. During they day they will have various groups related to nature. They have a gem weekend and several flower exhibit weekends. Always something interesting.Right now they have a Lantern Moon Light Festival. It is a wonderful way to see the park after dark. The Lanterns are placed by a group from China. They are beautiful inthe day time and magical at night.I have had many experiences at the Aboretum and all different and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsaurenman2019
40,Beautiful walk,"Well signposted with plenty of free parking. Entrance was good value and there was a nice reasonably priced cafe and gift shop. The gardens were very large and took us 3 to 4 hours to walk around. They are very beautiful with lakes, streams and waterfalls but what made it really special is the old buildings they have relocated here including stables and a railroad depot. There were restrooms as you went round and plenty of seats where you can take a rest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
40,Moonlight Forest LA Arboretum,"Get there early for parking, and to do the walking tour early. If you get there for the second entrance, 7:30, the traffic just to get to the location and to try to get into the facility is a huge traffic jam. Avoid that car mess by doing first entry at 5:30. It's an easy light walking stroll around the park to see the light up sculptures. Some attractions get crowded but you can move around. Again get there early at 5:30 opening to see all. Only negative thing is taking photos of yourself and friends. All photos even with flash or night vision on cameras the pictures still come out blurry. Very very difficult for pictures to come out cause of dark night. If you take pictures of the sculptures those will be fine. But once someone gets in front to pose near sculptures it wont work. The park should put better lighting around the sculptures so all poses can work. Worth the visit once. No need to repeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamae1
40,Lovely place to walk!,"I love walking laps around the outer perimeter of the Arboretum - and if I've got the energy, also hiking up either the ""staircase"" or the ""back road"" to the Top of the Falls! The views of the San Gabriels & the surrounding civilization are wonderful at the very top of the hill!I only dinged The Arboretum one star because for at least a YEAR they've had the old historical Adobe blocked off, ""Under Repair."" (For over a YEAR? Really? And why do I NEVER see anyone working on it even though I go over there at least once a month?)I also just don't understand what the problem is with the bodies of water... Bodies of water are all too rare here, in the LA basin, so why can't they just give us back the lovely little lake by St. Anne's Cottage, the waterfall (okay, It seems they may have fixed that!), & the small duck ponds that have now been dry for several years?They finally refilled the St. Anne's Cottage lake, and before you knew it, the entire thing had turned stinky green with stagnant algae overgrowth! This is Los Angeles! Can't they PLEASE hire a biologist who can FIX this?!Other than those complaints, the staff do a great job of keeping the place clean & well-manicured, and the ""Peacock Cafe"" & Gift Shop up & running! (THANK YOU, Arboretum Staff!)A few years ago, The Arboretum let local artists display pieces of their work out in the open - all over the Gardens! It was wonderful! I really wish they'd do that again! We've got all these excellent Art Schools nearby - why not let those artists present another temporary installation at the Arboretum? It's been too long, and it keeps The Arboretum interesting for us locals who make frequent return visits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TourDuJour

50,Wow! What a great escape into nature!,I had some time to burn and was close by so I fell into this experience by chance. I was blown away by how incredible this natural space was and it was massive. I was able to enjoy botanicals from around the world and got a chuckle out of all the peafowl and even got to see some of their ugly young ones! I would go out of my way to get to this great attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefff727
50,Peacocks and more...,"Spent a great day walking around here. Really enjoyed it, the number of oriental trees are amazing, and includes the 'mousetrap' tree from Madagascar (the fruit is used as a mousetrap !Timing was good as there were peacock chicks wandering around with their mothers...Would avoid in high summer as not a lot of shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gravity-Graham
50,Botanic Garden,"Great walking areas, with lots of beautiful flowers. Enjoyed the displays at the Arboretum, it was quiet as we were there during the week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReginaT63
50,Great day trip,"This was an amazing experience for my family! We paid extra for the tram tour since it was our first time. The Peacock Caf√© prices were very reasonable and the food was good. Peacocks and peahens were everywhere which was really nice! Got some great quality pictures of my kids and the landscape. My husband was the most impressed with everything. If I had let him, he would have stayed for many more hours but we had to leave to head back to Vegas. A little tip if you travel a lot or have a family: get the membership! The membership was $62 for a year and can be used at a lot of botanic gardens and preserves around the country. Here in Vegas, entrance for our family of 4 would be about $51, but now we can get in for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortesa87
50,"Great place to watch birds, stroll, just not in summer heat","Group of 3 did the LA. Botanic garden . Heat was oppressive. Good number of benches, but many in sun. Would not return in summer months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelroc12
50,Various Landscapes & Historic Architecture Worthy of an Adventure,"Fun exploration through well manicured grounds offering various landscapes, plantings, Arboretum, water gardens and more. Our grandson enjoyed meandering over the faux-serpent walkway after strolling through the lush purple Mexican sage, covered in butterflies and abuzz with bees. We journeyed through the temporary colorful Asian sculpting of overscale candy, sea life, dragons and Ark animals, apparently beautifully illuminated at dusk. Along Baldwin Lake we discovered ""Fantasy Island"", while naturally calling out: ""the plane, the plane!"". The historic Landmark Queen Ann Victorian home and nearby Coach Barn have been a Hollywood focal point since the 1930's. Spend hours here discovering throughout the grounds, then grab a bite to eat at the Peacock Caf√©, where you can have a close encounter with its namesake. Truly an impressive and enjoyable experience. Worthy of return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimGTravels

50,Beautiful day with the peacocks,"We had a nice day with the peacocks showing off their feathers. It was a beautiful day to take portrait or nature photos. The walking areas was nice and easy not too bad for anyone, flowers were beautiful and you can enjoy sitting outside on the cafe patio with friends and family. They are busy on the weekend but definitely worth going to once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnamQ1253TW
40,Lovely Botanical Garden,Great place to spend a lazy afternoon. They have a great variety of programs and events--be sure to check and see if something special is happening at the time you plan to visit. Staff is great. Only disappointment was the Gift Shop---they could be making alot of money to support the Arboretum if they would carry more varied and unique items.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthwestLivingTV

50,Everyone Loved It Even the Skeptics,"The Arboretum is a magical place & one that deserves time to discover & explore. This review speaks to only one of their programs Forest Bathing. To see what else this wonderful place has to offer check their website.Our guide for our Forest Bathing experience was Jackie. As she explained, this wasn‚Äôt a nature walk but an opportunity to release the stress of every day with an assist from nature.Two members were highly skeptical that this new age mumbo-jumbo would have any impact on them. However, after a couple of hours of guided introspection, we all felt rested & refreshed in a way usually associated with the elusive ‚Äúgood night‚Äôs sleep‚Äù.Whether you are visiting or live in LA, make time for the Arboretum on your list of things to do. Whether you are fortunate enough to have a schedule that can include Forest Bathing or just spend couple of hours wandering the grounds, it will be ‚Äúworth the journey‚Äù.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylj489
30,"Nice, BUT","The place was probably a stunner, many years ago. While the grounds are pleasant the years of neglect are apparent. Some of the areas are really quite nice while others are almost depressing (Australia and Africa, for sure). All the waterways are close to nasty: muddy and algae-ridden. Obviously, the gift shop is stellar, Don't go out of your way,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1729LOrobertb
50,Beautiful Garden and Trees,I was pleasantly surprised that the arboretum had more than just trees. It is beautifully landscaped with excellent paved walking paths and a wonderful cafe.We spent a couple of hours there. They accept a lot of other Botanic garden memberships so we got in free.Parking is kind of limited so get there early.They had several nice plantings of white poppies in bloom right now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjok456
50,Everything but the wood chipper,"This is a large and lovely garden with many different plant zones. Africa, Australia, prehistoric forest. And many opportunities to get a photo of a peacock in full display mode. The only drawback was the wood chipper running incessantly the entire time I was there. Rather spoiled my enjoyment, but hopefully this isn‚Äôt a regular occurrence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlamencoKat

50,A fine botanical collection,"Visited the Arboretum to see an iris show in Ayers Hall then decided to walk around the whole garden. I was impressed with the large quantity of mature flowering pink tabebuias and the fine collection of other trees, many in bloom. The peacocks add an exotic and colorful touch and the Canada geese with their young were fun to see. The collection of classic roses was very nice. At this time of year the many citrus trees in bloom around the rose garden add an air of romance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901nelsc
50,Beautiful tranquil setting,The grounds are huge and it has definitely taken a more botanical route than in the past. Some of the older structures are gone but the grounds remain beautiful with an amazing mix of flora. The peacocks are bold and seem to take pleasure in strutting around the gardens and parking lots.

This time we saw egrets, a pelican, and some hooded mergansers in the pond! There's no time of year that isn't beautiful to see, and of course the peacocks always make you feel like you're really in a special place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecd48
40,Moonlight Forest - Lantern Art Festival,"In 2018, the festival debuted at the Arboretum during the holiday season at night. Tickets are available in advance on line. The arboretum is transformed into a visually stunning Asian-themed ""zoo/garden/visual delight"" of animals, flowers and other objects all created by well lit ""magic lanterns"" In addition to the exhibits, which are viewed by walking around the arboretum, there were a handful of food trucks and a performance stage which featured amazing Chinese acrobats, jugglers and dancers. Check the weather if you decide to go next year, as it was very cold the night we attended. This was a very unusual festival and we're glad we went. However, it wasn't so spectacular that we are likely to go back again next year. It is worth seeing once though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricG141
50,Great Place To Take The Family,"On a recent visit with our California family, we enjoyed spending the day at this great attraction. The kids loved running the trails and exploring, while the adults savored the serenity of the plants, lake, peacocks, and decorations throughout. At the time we were there, it was decorated with The Moonlight Forest - Lantern Art Festival, and we could feel the touch of the ancient Chinese culture. Admission to the arboretum is very reasonable, and provides a wonderful opportunity to relax and escape to the outdoors. If you are grow weary of the density of the LA area, take the time to find yourself at the Arboretum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/161alant
50,Local Wilderness,"I have been a member for the past three years, enjoying the wide variety of plants and trees. Dozens of small signs educate visitors of the types of plants and trees there. Aside from the famous peacocks wandering the property, Baldwin Lake is home to ducks, geese, and occasionally herons and pelicans. Lost in the Australian, African, or native trees, you almost forget that you are in the suburbs of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar811788
50,Beautiful Park! See Moonlight Forest During the Holidays!,I've lived in Arcadia most of my life. The Arboretum is a lovely place to visit. The just treated my whole family to the Moonlight Forest lantern show. We were blown away. I never thought it would be that big or that great. I wish we had done dinner with the food trucks. When it comes back for the holidays - go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyR444
40,Pleasant Stroll with Young Children,We came for the moonlight festival on December 23 and had difficulty figuring out after U-turns and traffic jams to park in the shopping mall lot across the street and walk back to the entrance. Everyone being in holiday mood makes it tolerable. The light displays were colorful and attractive to young children. Taking photos of people was difficult though because of the lights. Quite a long walk and the looping paths were confusing. Ended up taking the wrong exit and a long way back to the parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenL155
50,"Beautiful Gardens. Summer Concert Venue, Moonlight Forest","My second time coming to this venue for a summer concert. My friend and I sat on the lawn (bring a blanket and picnic) for a Trace Adkins performance. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt in LA, but a small town where everyone was hanging out and enjoying the bandstand. There are tables where you can pay a bit more which are in front of lawn seating. The performances at the Botanic Gardens tend to be shorter than other concert venues, but the ticket prices are low and the environment so appealing. Of course the gardens here are lovely. I have been here during the day and it‚Äôs a lovely activity. There are peacocks on the premises too. They don‚Äôt hang out in the concert area, but if you head to the bathrooms, you will see them.I also came here on 12/23 for Moonlight Forest, Magical Lantern Arts Festival. It was extraordinary and if you can go, Go. It closes 1/6/19. I was blown away by the endless displays. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice. You can get a slight discount by buying through Goldstar. Worth every penny. Traffic by the venue for the festival is a nightmare. Go early. They have off site parking with a shuttle, which really isn‚Äôt that close or convenient. A lot of people park in the Westfield shopping mall lot and walk. Supposedly this is not allowed, but clearly a lot of people do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Moonlight Forest Lantern Festival,"We totally loved it! There were lights everywhere! A lot of them were larger than life-size! Parking is free but a little difficult onsite. Even though were came an hour early, the parking lots were full. Fortunately, the Santa Anita Mall across the street has ample free parking.The show was quite enjoyable. The benches are limited in number so they filled up quickly in spite of us getting to the stage area 15 minutes early.We had a great time and would highly recommend to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/986roels
50,Beautiful any time of year,"Took my mom to the arboretum and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff is very helpful, and assisted with a wheelchair rental for my mom - which costs $10. They are available on a first come/first serve basis. All of the main paths were accessible by wheelchair. However, there are several dirt paths that are worthwhile - and a couple that border on being hikes. Take advantage of the map you will be given when you enter. It will help plan your walk to make sure you see everything. Also, there are signs along the way that confirm your location.I wasn't too impressed with the food offerings at the Peacock Cafe. But the flowers, plants and trees you will see here more than make up for that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GareThere
40,Great place to walk outdoors!,"I always enjoy walking The L.A. Arboretum, and the third Tuesday of every month you can enter free of charge. (Much easier than at The Huntington in San Marino, where you practically have to apply & then wait to ""win the lottery!"") The Arboretum doesn't have the exquisite Japanese & Chinese Gardens (or amazing Cacti Garden) as The Huntington, but it does boast rare species of plants from around the world, and 2 or 3 ponds + a giant waterfall. I love all the water features, but if you can't take heat & humidity, just know that it can feel super HUMID in there during the summer months! You can actually get a good workout at The Arboretum if you run up the road to the top of ""the mountain!"" (Top of the waterfall too!) Some of my favorite view spots are up there - great panoramas of The San Gabriels! Another of my favorite view spots is sitting on the patio outside The Peacock Cafe. From this outdoor dining area, you can look South across the vast expansive lawn to the great fountain, or you can gaze West (over their Southwestern-style cactus garden), OR you can look North towards the mountains. The Peacock Cafe has pretty good coffee (& flavored creamers!), some great sandwiches, and even a burger & fries grill. Nice place to share a casual lunch. (No wait staff - you order at the counter.)The history of the Arboretum is quite interesting, and you can really get a feel for it when you read the plaques inside the old horse stables and around the Queen Anne Cottage. Twice a year (I think) they open that old Victorian home for tours! The Holiday Tour is my favorite when they actually decorate the rooms with vintage Christmas decorations from that era. I always see ""flashbacks"" of ""Fantasy Island"" when I view the ""lake"" by the cottage! So fun to get to revisit the place where they filmed that old TV show! I love the gift shop at The Arboretum because they're always changing it with the Seasons, and yet it also always carries out a Garden theme... You could walk fast and see most of the gardens in an hour, but it's better to take your time and really explore all that the whole place has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside63362
40,Very pleasant surprise,"We went here as a substitute for the Huntington garden and library which was closed on Tuesday. Surprising pleasant visit, nice walks with plants and trees nicely marked and even a special exhibit with paper lanterns of animals of all kinds.

50,Visit,Took a friend from out of town to see the arboretum. She enjoyed a lot and got to see the peacocks. Was a good time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindan469
50,"Great visit, pricey","This is a great arboretum and garden, but I found it on the pricier side when it comes to locaL gardens. True, it is not as expensive as the Huntington Gardens, but still pricey.The shows that they have and special events are spectacular for the most part.Definitely avoid weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenskef
50,Educational and engaging,"It's been years since we've visited the Arboretum, and we were delighted to see the improvements since.The Arboretum was initially established as a demonstration growing area for horticultural introductions to the local California landscape during the building boom following WWII. Within the past 10 years, the mission has been refreshed to emphasize education and local community engagement. It is currently administered by a public/private partnership that balances resources and engages the community in an active way.Aside from that, there are acres of lovely grounds for individuals, families and groups to enjoy year-round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ameliacatproko
50,Fantastic place for family!,"Have you ever seen peacocks outside the zoo in the wild life? This is the place for you to experience wild-life peacocks! Be sure to come to Arboretum in the early morning, you would find a flock of peacocks. Also kids can run around the park and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonytM9129JA
50,Fun,"I took one of my Australian cousins here, because he is what is called an ""arborist"" in his country, and he really loved it. It was lovely, and the walking is good exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,great place to stroll,we are pass holders here and it's a great deal. we can come as often as we like and have a nice walk admiring the great trees and grounds. great family place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandyG728
50,An understated beautiful park,"The first time we came to Pasadena we visited the Huntington Library and were obviously impressed. I did think this wouldn't be as good but I was wrong. Perhaps because fewer people visit, it just seems like a much calmer, peaceful place to truly escape the crowds. The peacocks just add to the this wonderful botanical experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2387YWhelenf
50,Wonderful,I was a wonderful experience even my husband liked this one better than a few other ones we have been to. The kids had an amazing time taking pictures of the peacocks and the flowers would go back again #1 in our list still have other to check out in California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
50,"Peaceful walk among flowers, trees, and bushes.","Walk on cement paths, mostly, and view the flower bushes, botanical garden, and huge grassy area to sit and relax. Even has a waterfall toward the back. Lots of pareking, and across from racing, and big mall. Great place to bring kids, take photographs, or have a weekend afternoon outing. Beautiful place. Has butterflies and hummingbirds, too, depending upon time of year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/821kayeb
40,Fabulous Place to Visit,"The arboretum is beautiful and a great place to see Peacocks of all shapes and sizes. It was very hot during our visit so would have appreciated more shade, but we had an enjoyable time. The gardens are very well maintained",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BilboKMB
40,Don't miss the Depot and the Madagascar area,"We went to the arboretum on a very warm morning, but found a good deal of shade as we walked. Our favorite area was the exhibit of Madagascar plants--so strange, and most plants had diabolical thorns! Very interesting. Don't miss a visit to the historic depot at the edge of the arboretum (easy to not notice it). The docents inside are very nice and informative about life in the depot way back when (the stationmaster lived on the second floor). It might not be open every day, so check first. Need lunch? The Peacock Cafe was a lovely spot (indoors and cool, fortunately) with a nice menu and surprisingly good food--as well as peacocks posing in the trees just outside the big windows. :-) The arboretum's gift shop is very nice as well. Overall, an affordable and very pleasant experience. (One caution: The maps they give you are quite hard to follow and the various paths are not well marked in places.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnD260
40,Nice,"Large place, takes a lot of time to see everything. There are some cool things ‚Äî lots of peacocks, even with baby chicks, great bamboo display with black, green, yellow and brown types, nice waterfall and Baldwin Lake with many turtles that love to swim next to the surface, old buildings that house some artifacts, like fire crew equipment or carriage. I loved all the big and easy to read labels on the trees/shrubs. Because the place is so big we only saw around a fifth of it. And it took us 2 hours. But we were not rushing too, taking our time. However, the tram that is supposed to take you around only works on Saturdays. Not convenient for us, because we were counting on it. And it seems that the place is too big and everything is spread out. I think it is nice to go there, but it is like going to the park ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect it to be packed with things to see at every 100 feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LE1805
40,Good size to wonder around,"It is not too big and good place for a very pleasant walk. Unless you have a good sense of direction, you will wander around and wonder where you are. But that‚Äôs what nature is about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/979dianem
40,Beautiful garden with many things to see!,"If you have a botanical garden membership, you could visit all others gardens in Los Angeles for free. Otherwise its $9 for adult admission, $6 for senior/students, free for children under 4. We went last weekend which they had the Tarzan theme and lots of display, photo booth, crafts. Besides they always had peacocks roaming around for photographing. A great place for families, where the path are well paved and smooth, lots of trees, flowers and gardens. The Queen's Anne Cottage and the waterfall are the highlight of the walk. The only thing is they do not have too many benches to rest and few bathrooms- only close to the entrance and on the other end of the garden. Parking in the front .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
50,Beautiful Gardens. Summer Concert Venue,"My second time coming to this venue for a summer concert. ,y friend and I sat on the lawn (bring a blanket and picnic) for a Trace Adkins performance. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt in LA, but a small town where everyone was hanging out and enjoying the bandstand. There are tables where you can pay a bit more which are in front of lawn seating. The performances at the Botanic Gardens tend to be shorter than other concert venues, but the ticket prices are low and the environment so appealing. Of course the gardens here are lovely. I have been here during the day and it‚Äôs a lovely activity. There are peacocks on the premises too. They don‚Äôt hang out in the concert area, but if you head to the bathrooms, you will see them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
30,Nice gardens but confusing signs,"The gardens are beautiful but the map they give you and the signs are very confusing and do not make sense , resulting in walking in circles and not being able to find things you want to see. The cafeteria: food is not great, the peacocks around you are fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MakeMyBed
50,"A hidden gem, close to the 210 freeway","First time visit, wish I had known about the gardens years ago. Well maintained grounds, wonderful Australia and Africa gardens, loved the smells in the herb garden, fun history to see at the old railroad depot building. Peacocks strutting around and showing of their plumage!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee-Tarbet
50,Designing a garden? Got to come here!,"Wow! This place is amazing. We thought we would drop by but ended up spending five hours here! Remarkably well done herb garden logically organized by culinary herbs, medicinal herbs, etc - we learned a lot, being able to see and smell a large quantity of herbs at one opportunity. Also loved the rose garden - traditional type in full bloom, and the bamboo/palm garden. Great value!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrangeOrb
50,Fun place to visit,"Enjoyed exploring the paths to the diverse areas of the arboretum. Tropical plants in the greenhouses were blooming and very colorful, then a couple minutes walk found a different world of desert cacti. Appreciated seeing zeriscape areas, too. Saw lots of lovely peacocks wandering about, great photos!! Had 2 hours to wander and enjoy a relaxing respite from a hectic travel schedule. Nice cafe and gift shop, if that is your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetbI2665IX

50,Lovely,"I really liked the waterfall with the turtles. The front entrance with the fountain is also nice. Liked the California water garden, too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaminDC
30,Good points but flagging in certain upkeep,"Overall this was a worthwhile visit and of course the peacocks are annoying yet fun to see. The gardens/arbor can take some time to walk and probably a bit tough in the summer. In my opinion areas of improvement, especially for those botanically interested would be much better labeling of plants ( many tags missing or broken), with the inclusion of a touch of natural history, common uses of the plants, palms and trees. The greenhouse was a little sad, neglected not forgetting that CA is dryer climate and maybe takes more effort with some water loving plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLtrotter
40,Large and diverse garden walk,"A large Arboretum and botanic garden. Plants and trees are in various areas in geographic sections on the grounds. Australian, Mediterranean, South American, African, and North American.Fountains, ponds, and lots of peacocks. Long pathways help in getting around.Recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3209AAbrunos
50,Great walking paths....,"Really enjoyed this nicely laid out garden, broken into segments by plants from the different continents. There is a very wide, asphalt path you follow as you go from one area to the next, making it very easy for families with strollers or anyone who needs assistance moving around.TIP- if you have a garden membership in your hometown, check to see if they have a reciprocal agreement with this garden. If they do, you get in here for free.TIP- From downtown LA you can take a metro train to Arcadia, then ride the free Arcadia bus that takes you to the garden, race track, mall, and a few other places. Takes about 90 minutes all told, but the train is only $1.75 so this is very cheap, and at 90 minutes could still be quicker than driving a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc

50,Great place!,We walked here before going across to Santa Anita Park. The grounds of the Arboretum are beautiful. We were there in winter so it was fairly dormant but there it still a lot of greenery. The waterfall and peacocks were the highlights. You can choose a shorter walk or a longer one depending on which paths you take. Will definitely come back if we're in the area again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63
50,Gorgeous place for a stroll,We got passes so that we can enjoy the beautiful arboretum any time. It‚Äôs a great place for a walk or a run. The little cafe is very reasonably priced and there are picnic tables outside of the arboretum if you‚Äôd like to bring a lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zsanineb

50,Plants of the World in a Serene Setting,"This 127 acre botanical garden and arboretum was the home of ""Lucky"" Baldwin, who planted many different trees, including myriad varieties of citrus, but also tropical plants (including bananas). It has been expanded to include gardens of plants from Australia and Africa, and there is a tropical greenhouse with some gorgeous orchid specimens.Here are some suggestions:1. Admission includes a map of the gardens. But, if one is available, I recommend a guided tour, which are offered Tuesday - Friday at 10, and 10:30 on Saturday (tours not available on the ""free"" third Tuesday of the month, however, NOR DURING THE MONTHS OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER).2. Baldwin's train depot is only open certain days, and tours of it are offered Tuesday and Wednesday from 10 -4, and Sundays 1 - 4. AGAIN, NOT DURING AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER!3. If you decide to see the gardens yourself with the map, I suggest taking the paths through the various areas, rather than just walking on the road around the outside of each section - you will see a lot more plants ""up close and personal"" that way.4. The ""cottage"" is only open once or twice a year (in 2017 this is Sunday, December 10). A small additional fee is charged. At all other times, you can walk around the verandah and look in the windows to see the furnishings. (There is a wheelchair lift to give access to the verandah - I did not inquire how that is accessed).5. The carriage house is a ""must see"", and is open so that you can walk through it and admire the coach and the farm implements stored in what must have been the tack room.6. The garden is fully wheelchair accessible, and, of course, there are ADA parking spots.7. There is a little cafe near the entrance where you can sit down and re-fuel.I suggest allowing no less than 3 hours, 4 -5 hours if you really want to see everything, or are a plant buff And those hours will be well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nevertooold53
40,Wonderfully relaxing and educational,"I had not been to the Arboretum in years. I used to visit with my kids as it was a great place to explore and burn off some toddler energy. It is still a terrific place for kids, better than ever in fact with several engaging demonstration gardens. There are many open spaces to enjoy, mature trees to marvel at, and excellent programming-classes, lectures, and exhibits for all ages. I have suggested that you allow yourself enough time to 'get lost' in the beauty of the Arboretum; it will be well worth it. There is a restaurant onsite which I did not try at my last visit but plan to next time. Nature is alive and welcoming at the Arboretum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heather747

50,A walk on the park,"When we need to get out of the house with our two grandchildren- a 4 year old and a 10 month old- there is no place better than the Arboretum. Wonderful trails, peacocks galore, fish, turtles, squirrels. Beautiful waterfalls and ponds to explore. There's always a stick nearby to poke around with. Beautiful gardens to walk through. The original Hugo Reid Adobe, now under renovation, is nearby Queen Anne's Cottage and Carriage House which keep history alive as the Victorian buildings for Lucky Baldwin's Rancho Santa Anita. The one sad point is Baldwin Lake and Lagoon. With our years of drought, the waters have disappeared and a major campaign is underway to restore it to its original beauty. The Santa Anita depot is also a hit. Walking old railroad ties is safe here. All in all there is so much to do and such fun doing it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbadams7
50,Tarzan's Jungle,"The Los Angeles County Aboretum and Botanic Garden is a beautiful garden and arboretum with an amazing jungle of lush diverse plants. Yes, this is the site used to film Tarzan and if you are a fan of dinosaur movies, the views of bamboo gardens, unusual succulents, australian plants and the waterfall may feel familiar because Jurassic Park was filmed here also. Spend the day in these exotic gardens where peacocks walk freely and imagine your own adventure as you are surrounded by nature's loveliness.

50,"Arboretum & Botanic garden held their biggest Inter-City Cactus and Succulent Show August, 2017","The biggest cactus and succulent show in the area has the most displays for award winning cactus and succulents. It is amazing how people can grow such cool plants.The show and sale is free, however, there is an admission to the Garden. The garden offers 127 acres of beautiful grounds and a waterfall, lake, and more. Be sure to have your best walking shoes. Regular admission is $9. and for seniors and children $6. Members of the San Gabriel cactus garden club go into the show first w/o paying admission. Get there early....parking gets full quickly.After purchasing plants, they will hold your plants so you can go visit the gardens. I'm not sure if they offer a tram to get around, but it would be difficult for people who can't walk long distances.I would recommend the LA County Arboretum & Botanic Garden and the annual San Gabriel Cactus and Succulent Show & Sale held in August.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluecar88
40,A walk in the gardens,"We came here on a warm summer morning to see the cactus and succulent show, which was amazing in terms of variety and unusual plants. We then took off on some of the trails. There are a lot of visitors on the weekend so I recommend arriving by 10 or 11 am to get good parking. A bottle of water and sun hat are also a good idea. You will see and hear peacocks, and we ate lunch at the suitably named Peacock Cafe which was reasonable in price and offered tasty food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalifCar

40,Beautiful,The arboretum itself was quite big and very beautiful. A huge variety of trails and plants. If you plan on coming take food which you can eat outside and then enter again with a stamp on the hand. The cafe isn't the best so I don't recommend eating there. The customer service was okay. It is typically very hot in Arcadia during this time of year so take plenty of H20.Hope this helps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indiejacks

40,fun day trip from LA,"decided to go on tuesday when the park offered free admission. From downtown LA the trip was about 30 mins. The park is split into two areas (the africa/australia side, and then the other side with the waterfalls/ turtle pond and baldwin lake). we ventured towards the latter and enjoyed out walk. Super hot day, bathrooms are sparse so make sure to use the restroom at the ticket office and refill your water bottles. Waterfall is most scenic part of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpond
50,Amazing Experience,"It's such a beautiful place, I honestly think it's the most beautiful garden I've been to. It's reasonably priced and has so many gorgeous spots.

I highly recommended this place, it's fun for all ages and very romantic for couples. It was not very crowded, so we really enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JunglePanther

50,Saturday evening concert series - Excellent,"We booked to sit on the lawn for a 6:30 Concert featuring LeAnn Rimes. It was a lovely venue and a super activity. $12 per ticket including fees through the Pasadena Symphony website. (.50 cheaper than Goldstar.) started on time. Show was short, ending by 7:45. Would have loved more. They do not rush you out after the show so you can lounge for a while. You can enter grounds at 5pm. There are food trucks. Or you can bring in your own food and drink. Parking at arboretum $10. At Santa Anita race track with shuttle $6. Closer to the stage they set up tables. The tickets are higher$ for those seats-not sure the price. This is such a lovely activity. I'd do it again, for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,One of the Few Good things to see in Arcadia,If you like to see a lot of nice fauna and other plants. Then this is the place to go to when in the San Gabriel Valley.Some Hints from a NativeAvoid coming during the Summer Time and Early Fall. As it gets mighty Hot here by Mid Afternoon.Wears some comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking.If one of the local Peacocks leaves a blessing on your car. Get it wash asap. The stuff is horrible on most cars paint jobs.Also the Peacocks can be very nasty. Especially around young kids who do not know better.Also if you have youngsters. Keep a close eye on them as there a lot of places for them to hide in.Bring some fluids to drink as you can really build up a thirst here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,So much to see and do!,First of all the Peacocks are awesome ! We ate at the caf√© and they just hang out with you. The gardens are gorgeous and we got some great exercise.

50,Beautifully designed nature's best,"We took a stroll on a weekday morning. Not too crowded and the breeze, flowers and plants are plenty and fragrant.

The orchid green house is a must see. there are plenty of ideas for your backyard design with flower beds, walkways and hanging plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holly0419
40,"Lots of walking, plants and peacocks","If you like nature and walking, take a stroll here. We only saw half of this place, as the kids were getting tired. The waterfall and turtle pond were nice to look at. The walking paths are cemented and very wide. A grounds map is provided but we felt like more signage was needed along the paths to tell you what you were looking at and where you were going. The rest of the family went to the Faery Hunt event. It was not worth the $15. There was no hunt. Arm painting was done with markers. There was not enough stuff to do for the little fairies. Aside from that, the gardens are extensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545kareno
40,Walk in the park,"Due to the drought and planned restoration of Lake Baldwin, the lake in front of the cottage and other ponds are dry. It was a stark contrast to my memories coming here in my youth . The park has adapted well to incorporating many areas to less thirsty landscapes. It's still a relaxing way to get some exercise while enjoying the flora. The tram on the weekends makes it easier for those who want a narrated overview before setting out on their own . The Thai noodle salad in the cafe was tasty. I found the price of $6.20 for the Thai noodle salad and ice tea very reasonable .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janeane42
50,Peacocks!,Beautiful place with hundreds of peacocks. Lucky Baldwins Victorian home is there which has been used in film and movies. And the lagoon was used in a few Tarzan shows.

40,As good and less effort than Huntington Gardens,"The Arboretum and Botanic Garden spans 127 acres next to the Santa Anita Racetrack. There are many areas of interest and the only thing missing, IMHO, is a Japanese garden. One benefit is that the gardens are relatively flat which makes it a lot easier for older people than the Huntington Gardens. Everything is very well laid out and labeled. It does take a long time to see all of the gardens so you should plan for a long morning or afternoon. The Queen Ann Cottage and Coach Barn are worth a stop. You can't go into the cottage but you can see how the rooms looked like when peeking through the windows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelloggTraveler
50,Always Something in Bloom,I love this arboretum! Either for a morning walk/jog or just to get some fresh air and escape the chaos of the city.

50,A quiet and beautiful escape from the city,"We truly love the arboretum. It's a great place to walk around while enjoying all the flowers, trees, and of course, the peacocks. An ideal day at the arboretum would include a picnic basket, so that you can lay out a blanket by the lake or under a tree and just enjoy what nature has to offer. In addition, walking the entire park is a great way to get a low-impact workout without really feeling like you're exercising (just remember to bring comfortable shoes). If you don't feel like packing a meal, there is a coffee shop where you can get sandwiches and small bites as well as beverages. They usually have exhibitions going on, and of course there is a historical aspect to the place as well. But for me, it's a place where you can take a break from it all, whether with family or friends, or to enjoy your own company and get lost in your thoughts amid all that beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiacU7223DW
50,"Pick your tram ride carefully, and the visit is terrific!","The first time we visited here, our tram had a number of very noisy children,and their parents did nothing to keep them quiet enough for us to hear the narrative on the speakers. This time, there were few children, so we could hear everything clearly., and we found it informative and interesting. That tram ride made the whole excursion a wonderful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
40,Unbelievable peacock's,"We visited the gardens last week and were just amazed at the large number of peacocks that were just walking all around us, not in cages. The are so tame that you can get within 4 or 5 feet of them. They posed and turned and displayed their amazing feathers - we took so many photo's. Many of the gardens were nice, considering it was an overcast February day. Unfortunately, the gardens are not close to each other and we could not walk to many of them because of back issues. It's unfortunate that they did not have any tram system to move people between the gardens, since not everyone can walk those distances. I would love to go back to these gardens in the spring or summer, when I'm sure the flowers would be amazing. The grounds were in very nice shape and it was a nice visit. Wear comfortable shoes if you visit here and be sure to bring your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suetravel2015
50,Peaceful Oasis!,"If you have a day off and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everything which commands your attention, come here for beautifully landscaped gardens and beautiful peacocks! It's so nice to sit and just be at peace in a great setting which will help you relax and feel more connected with yourself and nature, ahh perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888Theo
50,Walker's choice,"Great place to take a walk on a beautiful day surrounded by luscious gardens near the Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia, CA.On any given day you will see Arcadia's famous peacocks along with other indigenous fowl.You will also see a historic train stop and read about Lucky Baldwin's ties to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakester1201
50,A Wonderful Walk in the Park!,"Full of local history and Lucky Baldwin, who used to own virtually all of Arcadia, a wide range of plants, trees and shrubs (and an extensive library and tram tour, should you wish to know more about them), and one of the biggest selections of bird life in the world. Great for birdwatchers. Abundant residents, peacocks, spread their glorious tail feathers to give you a show. A lot of fun to peek in the rooms at the Queen Anne Cottage and stables, with carriages and other artifacts from the early days, and the nearby adobe cookhouse. Great for all ages, particularly in our (usually) fabulous Southern California weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marjuh

50,Definitely a must see,"On my recent trip to the USA, I had the absolute pleasure walking around the Los Angeles County Arboretum & Botanic Garden.The weather was ideal.The sights and sounds bring you into the heart of the garden.There is so much to see and do. I loved the orchid enclosure but the highlight for me was seeing Queen Anne's Cottage better known as the house from Fantasy Island. I would have loved to have gotten into the tower to point to the sky and call out 'Mr Rourke, the plane, the plane.' but that was not to be.I would love to be back here when spring is in full bloom because I would say it will be more spectacular.Do yourself a favour and place the Los Angeles County Arboretum & Botanic Garden on your must visit list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheAdmiralW

40,Blooms and peacocks,"A large and peaceful garden with trees and plants from all over the world, ""California gingerbread"" style old buildings that have appeared in many TV shows, and many peacocks.

50,Beautiful and Quiet,This is a beautiful place to visit to relax and enjoy nature and God's creatures. When you drive up you are greeted by peacocks.

50,Serene haven for wandering,"If you enjoy plants, you need to allow several hours for this place. There are prehistoric gardens, cactus and desert plant collections, a big Australian section, some lovely Victorian buildings, ponds and more. Have fun in the gift shop- there is much more than the peacock themed items on the website.Locals can buy plants there too! Be aware that the arboretum is right by the Santa Anita racetrack, so sometimes traffic backs up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKT0707
50,Great variety and birds!,"We spent the whole day here and ate twice at the caf√©. Lots to see and do!

50,Enjoyable,This was a beautiful place to visit . It's very clean . If it was not near a busy street it would be very quiet and peaceful. Only thing not so good was that some water areas were dried up .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myprecious11
50,Beautiful grounds,"Enjoyed a beautiful day at the arboretum. I saw a hummingbird up close and a peacock for the very first time! Also, the house used for the opening of Fantasy Island!

50,A small slice of heaven in the midst of city life.,"I have been a member of this arboretum for about 15 years, ever since I first moved to Arcadia. Since then there have been HUGE positive changes to the grounds. New gardens, paths, sculptures throughout. Kudos to whomever took over as director. I will continue to renew my membership to support this lovely place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitforever
50,Beautiful and Relaxing,"This botanical garden is convenient to get to. It is well maintained and offers beautiful grounds, a very good cafe, and a relaxing environment. You can walk around the entire park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geneg244
50,Beautiful Place for Botany Enthusiasts,A very interesting park across from the Santa Anita Race Tracn and the Arcadia Mall. Beautifully lkept varied gardens. Wonderful place for summer night concerts and available for rental for large parties - we held a wedding reception here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDEYES
50,Wonderful outing,"Great place to take the family! The kids love the open air, the older members the plants, the really old enjoy the ADA compliant walkways. Take a picnic lunch and enjoy the peacocks! Or just walk for the exercise on over 2 miles of paths.My family and I have been going to the arboretum for years. My wife and I went there when we were dating over 40 years ago. Yes, we are season pass holders. However, even the small entry fee is a good deal. Don't miss the many film locations, the historic train station, or the historic structures built by Lucky Baldwin ( one of the three railroad barons of the west)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
50,Love nature,If you are a lover of beautiful nature you must see this miracle. Very well designed gardens and good atmosphere. Thanks for creating a beauty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4482HL_
40,Very Relaxing Place,I have been to the Arboretum many times as a local and it is beautiful there. It's a great place to take pictures and take a stroll while enjoying nature. Definitely recommend visiting at least once!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunchayz
40,A nice place to visit,"During my visit to SoCal my friends took me here and that was a good place to spend time walking and chatting while surrounded by nature - right in the middle of a busy metro life. This arboretum is also a historic place. However, there are downsides to this place: 1- No water! Ponds are dried up (because of California drought). 2- At times, the beauty of this special place is destroyed by the big crowd of obnoxious Chinese tourists or (residents?). In fact, Arcadia has become yet another Chinatown in the San Gabriel valley. These days, the arboretum (and virtually everywhere else in the Valley) makes you feel like you're in China, not the United States of America!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Airbus780
40,Great outdoor exercise,"My older children and I enjoyed the large park. Experiencing different climates and continents of flora. Enjoyed the large amounts of peacocks. Due to the drought in the state the ponds or lakes were low or dried up. Happy surprises were the coach house, and Victorian home from Fantasy Island, and the train depot. Note: it was not as enjoyable half way through due to the wildfires and the abnormal 106 degree heat! 2 hour minimum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global415549
30,Pasadena Pops event at the Arboretum,"Evening concerts are a staple of the Arboretum. We arrived a bit late and did not have seats at a table. Price seemed high for bring your own chairs to the lawn... at a significant distance from the stage. The Jumbotrons were near the stage and didn't help those in the lawn seats. Operators were not focused on the soloists so you barely could see what was being magnified. Also, the sound was not particularly good. We were seated just by the reflecting pool, so I don't think anyone with lawn seats was closer. Not a big hit with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebmans
50,Stunning....,"On the third Tuesday of every month you get in free! And what a treat it proved to be, as soon as we got in the gardens there were peacocks and some glorious plants and sculptures. A pleasant walk led us to the Austrailian snake trail...a path in the shape of a snake. Kids loved this...We then wandered to the waterfall, most of the plants had a description on them, being English pleased to see the Shakespeare Herb Garden and the English Oak trees! We saw lizards, turtles, rabbits,butterflies, fish, humming birds and the lovely peacocks. Glorious....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresak469
50,One of the most beautiful place in Los Angeles County,"We used to come here every week to appreciate the nature and the fresh air. This arboretum has come a long way. Over the years, the staff and volunteers developed this place into many different sections that featured different types of gardening. It's always a joy to see the beautiful peacocks strolling around the arboretum and made funny loud noises. I like to go there to spend a morning with my family and friends. A gem in Arcadia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audreyh379
50,Beautiful and they have a good horticultural library collection,"I love the library, and they have wonderful, knowledgeable librarians ... Lots of nursery catalogs, some periodical collections, and books. I really enjoyed the gift shop, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R842FNleeb
50,Nice break!,"Looking for a relaxing afternoon? Well this is the place. We took the baby and strolled the grounds for 4 hours. Of particular interest to myself was ""Madagascar"". I suppose it was flora from that island but I didn't stop to read. We had lunch down the road at the mall but there is a cafe in the Arboretum if one needs a snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
50,Beautiful relaxing place,Love going there doing my morning walk so peaceful ... Love the peacocks all over the place. The waterfall they have is beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gflove2travel

Their beauty is really a sight to see but don't go near them, just enjoy them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzyq818
40,PEACOCK every where...,"Great botanical garden. Lots of trees and plant. Not as pretty as Huntington library but have it own unique garden,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jt93664
30,Not so exciting,"We did go on a very hot day but still. ""Lake Baldwin"" was a mere ghost of its former self and the grounds were in need of better signage. Overall, I was disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tina1687
50,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful!","Tropical, Australian, African gardens, historic buildings and wildlife sanctuary with their famous peafowl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rond697
50,Nice Way to Spend the Day!,"My boyfriend and I went on the hottest day of our trip (100 degrees), but it was our last day and we wanted to see the gardens, so we went anyway. We were planning on having lunch at the cafe, but we were there on a Monday and it is closed Mondays. Luckily the (very well air conditioned) gift shop had refrigerated beverages (and snacks). In fact, I bought a few birthday presents for friends in the gift shop.The grounds are well maintained and are a nice, peaceful way to spend a day. We were there for a little over 3 hours and still didn't see everything. There is a man-made lake that, sadly (due to the drought), is fading away. We were told that they can add a minimum amount of water, enough to keep the existing wildlife alive.There are plenty of peacocks and peahens around and don't forget to look up! We saw a few perched in trees. Lovely to look at (see attached photo).The entrance fee is very reasonable ($9.00 for adults), and there are lots of interesting things to see and it's a nice way to get some fresh air & do a bit of walking. Don't miss the Queen Anne Cottage (we could only view from outside). It's the opening scene for the 1970's show, ""Fantasy Island"" where the bell was rung.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jahhp
50,A nice break from the cement city,"For a fairly cheap price you get access to some beautiful gardens, trails and historical cottages. There are so few parks and such sparse greenery in LA that this place is a small oasis just outside the cement city. It's cheaper than Huntington Gardens (also worth seeing, but very different). Once there, you encounter some peacocks that roam freely and scenery that makes you forget you are anywhere near a city.And- it's free the third Tuesday of every month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESLteacher7
50,Rendezvous with nature,"We(me and my wife) have been coming here for the past 3 years now and it is a fantastic place to go to if you want to be close to nature. This year we got ourmembership and no regrets at all with that. In fact we should have done that earlier. Coming from Burbank, this place is like 20 minutes away(without traffic).We love nature photography and this is a very good place to take pictures. I have attached some of the pictures that I took with the phone. Unfortunately, I can't add photographs taken with my dSLR as I have copyrighted them and TripAdvisor doesn't allow me to add images with copyright.Arboretum also conducts photography workshops, especially night photography workshops. Will try to attend one in near future.Main attractions:1. Peacocks and other birds: It won't be untrue if this place gets renamed to 'Peacock Garden'. You will find lots of them over here. They are friendly and beautiful birds. We have been lucky to see a few dancing ones. Well, now that we have been there at least 12-15 times, our chances of spotting a dancing peacock has increased :-) There are other birds(resident & migratory) who add to the mix. You will see ducks, egrets, hummingbirds etc.2. Variety of flora: This garden has botanical collections from all over the world. First timers, please try out the tram tour(I think it may only be available over the weekend). Please check the website for details. Rose garden is a very pretty sight, especially in Spring. Then they have the herbal garden, tropical greenhouse and many other gardens. Having comfortable walking shoes helps as you can explore more of this scenic location. Get some sun protection if visiting on a hot day.3. Good place for a walk: If you live close-by, this could be a good place to come for a walk. If you happen to be a member then you can come in as early as 8AM.For non-members, the place opens at 9AM.4. Historic structures: Queen Anne cottage, Coach barn, Santa Anita depot. More details can be found on the website.5. Very good place for wedding photography, family / corporate events. This place also gets rented as a location site for movies.6. Peacock cafe: Has both indoor & outdoor seating. Love the sandwiches and burgers they have. We have tried the vegetarian options and they are fresh & yum.Parking:They have enough parking available and it is free. There are 2 parking lots. Main lot is by the garden entrance and it kind of gets full over the weekends. If that gets full, you can also go to the south lot which is adjacent to the main lot and is approachable via Baldwin Ave.Overall, an excellent place for a family outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnkrishn
40,Enjoyable,We enjoyed getting away from the hustle and bustle to see the arboretum. There were flowers in bloom and others that obviously had been blooming recently. I was amazed at how green every thing is despite the drought. Other parts of the gardens seemed to be in their natural drier state. Also nice to see that,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjbugd
50,Always a wonderful visit,"We have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. The grounds are always beautiful and very well kept. I like that most trees, flowers, etc. have signs to tell you what they are. It's such a learning experience. Sometimes it's fun to take the tram to give yourself a break because there is so much to see. This visit the water was so low in the ponds. The waterfalls were barely a trickle. Very sad for all the water fowl that usually stop for awhile during their travels. This is really a destination not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whittier
50,Beautiful!!,"Incredible gardens, trails that lead all over the place, waterfalls, art, and great history. This place has it all for a fantastic experience. A great place for couples to just kinda get lost for awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbP4827QV
50,"If East of LA, GO HERE!","I am not by nature a person enjoying plants. But I will say for the small cost, this is a place to go. It is across the street from the Santa Anita race track, and really large. It is the old Baldwin family estate, as I was told, and has beautiful gardens, vistas of the mountains and great places for kids to run around. A definite place to go if in the San Gabriel Valley, but not sure if you are in downtown LA or on the beach it is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11douglast
50,BEAUTIFUL AND RELAXING!,"I've been coming to the L.A. County Arboretum and Botanical Garden for many, many years, because I simply love this place. It's huge, if there's a crowd it disperses quickly, because the place is so big. I often take walks and hang out in this ""garden"". It's divided into many different sections, there's also a lake with ducks, etc. The place is simply rejuvinating and pretty, with the mountains in the background. They offer tram rides and there's a gift shop and also restrooms. Their Cafe is nice to sit in for a burger and fries or just to enjoy a cup of coffee...actually, I prefer sitting outside on their terrace. Parking can be a little hard to find, as the place is quite popular, but it's well worth the trouble! Once inside, you forget about your woes. They also offer gardening classes, etc., though I've never taken any. This place is great for families with kids, or if you just want time away by yourself. I often see people tucked away on a bench, reading a book. Wonderful escape from the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
40,A Break from Amusement Parks and Malls,"Trees, flowers, ponds, ducks, easy walking paths, large lawn areas for kids to run around in, rose garden, benches under flowering trellises to watch birds, sections with planting from other parts of the world, a children's garden, handy tram for small fee circles the large area, pleasant little cafe near tasteful gift shop offering plants as well as nature items. Great place to recharge your batteries and regain some sanity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catbird28
50,Beautiful gardens to explore,"The Arboretum was a terrific place to spend the day. The large collection of beautiful plants from around the world are displayed in areas ranging from intimate patio settings to acres devoted to a particular continent. The peacocks that roam the property will help keep you entertained, as well. Bring your walking shoes and plan on spending at least a few hours, if not the whole day. They have the nice Peacock Cafe where a nice selections of edibles are available at a very reasonable price, so you can enjoy a nice lunch or snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevepup
50,A relaxing day in the garden,"We went on a Saturday morning in April. It was a beautiful sunny day, but not too warm. We went on a guided tour with a few other people and it was extremely informative. Our guide was a real nice older lady and she really enjoyed her work. We had a very nice walk through the entire gardens, which is a large area, and were fascinated by the history of the place. The highlight was seeing the carriage house and the Queen Anne cottage, though the cottage was not open to the public at that time. You could look through the windows though. Peacocks run free there and are something to see. There are great opportunities for taking pictures and just enjoying nature in the middle of one of the busiest cities on earth. The price for seniors was very reasonable and well worth it. The only disappointment is the fact that we are in a drought and the water level on the lake is very low. sad to think of the glory days of Hollywood when so many movies were filmed around that lagoon. I will advise you to wear comfortable shoes and bring water. There is a nice little snack bar type restaurant there but it was a little crowded so we did not eat there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Braddock52
40,FAMILY FRIENDLY AND PICTURESQUE,"makes this a wonderful place to visit as long as it isn't raining. It seemed like every corner we turned offered a new photographic opportunity, and it was just nice to walk and enjoy. Admission for two seniors was reasonable at $22 and that was with the 30 minute tram tour. There are a large number of peacocks on the property and some ducks, although due to the horrendous drought most of their ponds and streams are dry or exceedingly low. I was pleased to see a rare stand of California Engelmann Oak, one of the most drought tolerant oaks known. Additionally I liked see Gingko trees which are considered living fossils, because they are the tree with the oldest of their line from the time of dinosaurs! Their leaves have a scalloped edge to them. The Queen Anne Cottage, a Victorian mansion, was used for Fantasy Island on TV and there are jungle like areas that were used for part of the filming for Tarzan. There is a gift shop and caf√© for your enjoyment. Time permitting, the Arboretum is a must see, most definitely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyboy1320

50,Great Day Outing,Go on the third Tuesday of each month. It's FREE!!!Great day outing to a botanical garden. Loved all of the flowers and different regions of plants. Sad to see the pond is under restoration and the fish flailing around. And wish the house was open all the time. Guess that means I will need to go back next month.Tips- bring water- wear walking shoes- outside food is allowed inside so bring a picnic lunch- bring an umbrella or wear a hat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperienceMy31

40,An oasis in a residential area,I great place to take family or out of town visitors. The open spaces and gardens are of great interest as well as the little lake and Lucky Balrdwins Aueen Anne Cottage. Also of interest is a depiction of an Indian village. There are a number of pea cocks on the property showing off their fine feathers. Easy to get to with plenty of free parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665paulk
40,Nice place for a peaceful stroll,"Good variety of botany if that's what you're interested in. If not, it's still a nice place for a stroll or even work-out. Watch out for the geese... they are angry :).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kangar2016
40,Great way to spend a day,"I visited the Butchart Gardens in Victoria, British Columbia last July, so I have seen the best garden in existence. The Arboretum is definitely not on the same level as Butchart, but it is beautiful in its own way. I loved seeing all the peacocks and geese free to roam the premises. I spent 2.5 hours at the gardens and walked over 3 miles. The $9 admission was super reasonable for all I got to see. The volunteers tending to the gardens were extremely helpful and dedicated. They clearly take great pride in their work. The only downsides to the Arboretum are the freeway noise and the lack of shade. Wear a hat, and take water with you. Overall, I highly recommend a visit to the Arboretum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruinbabe
40,Peaceful yet exciting,We took my 4 year old granddaughter & were amazed by all the sights. Couldn't believe that peacocks were EVERYWHERE! Also enjoyed the turtle pond & fish along with lizards & rabbits. Lots of grassy areas for play & trails to explore beautiful plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MegQ
40,"Gardens, flowers, fountains, and waterfalls","Spent over 2 hrs and didn't see everything. Stopped several times to relax and take in the views, great variety of plants, etc. Asked at the entrance for some suggestions what was best at the time and this was helpful. Most plants, trees and flowers had labels many never heard of before. Loved the huge Floss silk trees and the tulip trees. Do not miss the waterfall area, especially on a warm, sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sundevil
50,a quiet walk in the park,"but bound to be interrupted by the calls of the peacocks! Yes, those delightful peacocks among the serene scene. Be aware that it is against the law to bother them. They have the right of way, I am told. The trees here are beautiful and it is a nice place to get away from the hustle of city life. And to get away from spending too much at the mall which is just down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentcK6882SV
50,Gorgeous and Peaceful!!,"Spent hours and it was well worth it!!! Beautiful gardens, trees, fountains. The Queen Anne house was gorgeous ad so was the other Elliott house.

Wonderful day for families or by yourself. Serene and beautiful. Trees from different countries are gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673deba
50,WOW If You Like Gardens This Is The place To Go.,"We were only there for an hour but really, you need to plan on several hours. The place is huge!

50,half day leisure relax,"I originally plan going to Huntington Library to spend a relax sunny day. the parking lot was full so i change my plan to this garden. it is so wonderful. many different view with water fall, Japanese garden, rose garden, lake view, it also big enough to spend a half day alone or with family. Peacock is an add on special feature. Really love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372jingyil
50,Spectacular Aloe in bloom,"The spectacular, fiery orange spears of aloe blooms made a beautiful contrast against the brilliant blue February skies. We felt as if we really were in Australia or anywhere, but LA, as we strolled through the cactus and aloe paths. In the tropical rainforest garden, my husband and I commented that it looked and felt like our backyard garden in Hawaii. The ferns and orchids were gorgeous! The sculptures and art throughout our journey through the arboretum were perfect for their environment and we saw many new and different pieces from our last visit.The hours are great--they open at 9am and our senior rates were $6 each. The regular adult prices were only $9. What a deal--you could spend hours here enjoying the various gardens. Bring an umbrella for sun or rain. Several people told my husband, who had an umbrella to shield the sun, that they wished they had brought one. The gift shop did have several garden-themed umbrellas for sale. Make sure you know where the bathrooms are and plan accordingly. If you plan to stay a while, they do have a cafe on the premises.When we visit L.A., we try to make a point to visit because each time, each season brings different viewpoints. Last time, in April, the cherry, plum and forsythia were abloom and just beautiful. We love the water ponds and spent time watching the ducks and turtles.After you're done, Santa Anita Mall is right across the street!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanHana
50,This is the place to take a date or family to just spend a quiet day,"I don't know how many acres they have of flowers and plants, but there has to be a lot. And then there are the Peacocks. This is one of the most non-stressful places I know of in the valley. Easy walking paths, motor driven trolleys for the less adventurous, and a great display area of natural artifacts found in the Arcadia/Sierra Madre areas. Owned by ""Lucky"" Baldwin in the 1800's, this is a subtle adventure that you can take anyone on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
30,The waterfall is probably my favorite part!!!,"I thuoght some parts of theArboretum were a bit dull, but the fact that it has so much to offer is amazing. I loved all the different aspects they had such as the water fall, the duck swamp and all the beautiful trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubijewls

50,Tranquil Respite,"My wife and I stopped here, during the day, on New Year's Eve. Not being from the area we weren't sure what to expect. We wound up spending 4-5 hours here. It is lovely and peaceful and the prices both in the cafe and gift shop were very reasonable. Also, the peacocks strolling the grounds were beautiful and added a pleasant charm to the ambiance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmboyGlenn
50,"Lovely gardens, beautiful peacocks, great scenery","This is a great place to visit for a day or half day. Nice and peaceful walk with lovely peacocks around. Beautiful gardens, among them I enjoy the amazing desert garden, and green house with different orchids flowering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PortDoverBeach

The weather was crisp and beautiful and the surrounding were heavenly. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
50,"Peacocks, plants and plentiful history!","Don't miss the Arboretum! Start with the tram ride to get an overview of the grounds. Then check out the tropical green house, Queen Anne Cottage and other special gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoLorenzo
50,wonderful place to spend an afternoon,"directly across from the Santa Anita race track and mall. this is a quiet and very interesting place to spend hours. staff are friendly. many resources for study of plants. these are arranged by continent, locale, ecosystem. if one has children and wants to show in an easy afternoon the huge variety of plant life on earth, this is the place to go. there are peacocks wandering the grounds. in some respects not as stunning as are the Huntington Gardens not too far away, but the LA Arboretum is less expensive, has somewhat longer hours of opening, and if one is not interested in the art, the arboretum is a worthwhile substitute. another advantage, if the arboretum restaurant is not open, the food court at the mall is a good place to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk
40,More than a day trip to see all the beauty!,"I have visited the Garden on several occasions now - during the week and on the weekend - and must say that is a wonderfully relaxing place where the plants are constantly changing which makes each visit special.The Arboretum and Garden is large and I expect it would take the whole day if you wanted to see the whole of it while on foot. My visits have lasted about 3 hours - in that time I have seen half of the park. They do offer tram tours on some weekends at specific times, but I have not done one of them yet!If you enjoy photography, bring your camera along and spent lots of time taking photos of the unique and varied plants and trees - and the peacocks which the Arboretum is known for. I have also found butterflies, rabbits and squirrels. It did not seem to make much difference as to time of day or day of the week - you will find yourself alone in parts of the Garden.At the end of my last visit, I walked through the Celebration Garden which is right inside the entrance - what an amazing spot just tucked away! It is filled with sculpture and some seating areas - I will definitely be back to this spot!The $9 entrance fee is very reasonable and will offer many hours of enjoyment in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeeP_13
50,Relaxing and scenic,"The Los Angeles County Arboretum & Botanic Garden is an excellent place to escape the pressures of the day while getting some much needed exercise at the same time. Most family doctors will advise their patients that walking is the best form of exercise to maintain heart health, minimize weight gain and maintain muscle tone. This is the perfect place; no cars, no unattractive retail outlets and office buildings, just trees and grassy fields. The Arboretum is large enough so you can walk around for hours and only see a few people. If you are looking to escape for a while and solitude in comfortable surroundings is your goal; this is the perfect place. The gift shop also has some nice items that you will find only at their store. If you are into nature photography besides the attractive landscape there is also some wildlife in residence. I am a person who works in an office all day and walking outside and finding the view is better in my office, becomes disheartening at times especially if you were around years ago when L.A. County had many beautiful locations. If you need to escape for a day or just a few hours, the Arboretum in Arcadia is the perfect place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyD1947
40,Beautiful gardens,"Went to the Arboretum for a wedding. It's a gorgeous place! So much to see!

Will definitely go back if I'm back in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L0ves2Trave1
50,True Beauty!!,Visited with my wife. Had a wonderful time. Truly relaxing experience. Australian garden was our favorite. Nice looking peacocks everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hector2016
30,Visited in November so not the best time ....the waterfall was turned off for maintenance.,Not a bad place but certainly have been to better abortions. The lack of signage is my chief complaint. There are forks in the path that really need to be marked. The maps that you receive do not show all of the paths. We ate at the cafe and the food was good and portions were appropriate. I had the ceaser chicken wrap it was huge. The peacocks were hanging out around the cafe so photo apps were abundant. The railroad stationwasopen and staffed with guides to give you history on the station and the area. There were not that many orchids in the hot house....but a few were blooming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sinie
40,A nice place to stroll around and to learn about plants,"This arboretum used to be the jewel of Los Angeles. Since they've been hit with funding, things have gone down a little bit. But they are doing a great job to stay afloat and to provide a place for people to enjoy the garden environment in the foothill of San Gabriel Valley. Since the drought has hit California hard, this arboretum has also become a victim. The landmark pond has dried up taking away the beauty once enjoyed by millions over the decades of its existence. There are so many things here to see and learn. So, I highly recommend it to children of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Airbus780
40,"More than a Botanical Garden - they filmed ""Fantasy Island"" here!","The place is much larger than what it seems from the outside. Check the map before you start walking so that you can focus your energy on what you want to see. Have been here on different seasons, fall and spring, in my opinion, are the best times to come, although I am told by one of my friends, that the place gets all decked out for the holidays. Down in the center of the arboretum, if you are over 40, you will recognize the house and the lagoon from the intro to the Fantasy Island TV show (""the plane, the plane!"" remember that?) they also have Lucky Baldwin's house and you can peek through the windows to see the historical furnishings. The orchids in the tropical gardens section are beautiful, the perennials garden is also pretty even when some of the plants are not in blooming season. The gift shop has probably some of the nicest selection of items that I have seen in my travels, not inexpensive for some things, but if you see something you like, buy it - as I didn't get an ornament thinking that I could find it on Amazon and no such luck. I do not remember if they have a food concession, but right across the street is a large shopping center with the usual restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4067BScristinas

I didnt really get the history of the place so didnt know why the garden was there. Came here for a wedding photo op. The monitor who hosted us was informative and nice. However once we entered the gift shop, the older lady who was working -- was totally out right rude. I'm used to a greeting when I enter. Not the other.So that soured our trip - but the garden was nice. I just don't recommend going to the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rain2018
50,Must visit,"This is a must visit especially for locals. Many hidden treasures, tours, and classes. The Arboretum frequently has special shows and not all of them are related to plants. Frequent upgrades to the surroundings make repeat visits a must. Beautiful for weddings and photography too. Come early, parking can be full by noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/638maryf
40,Lost in Paradise,"Really beautiful gardens, friendly staff (especially in the gift shop!). We had a difficult time navigating with the map, but it was fun being lost in paradise.

50,Four season gardens,"This Arboretum contain different plants from different area, is a bird sanctuary, with different kind of birds at different season. The historic Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn, the Adobe and the Santa Anita railroad depot. Green grass and clear fountain, great relax and picnic place. Different flowers bloom at different season, The best time visit is early spring. The place also set up different garden ideas to let you use in your own garden. There is a big mall cross street, and many good restaurants south of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RChangla
50,One of the most beautiful botanical gardens in California,Having going here since a little girl. I remember when the old Tarzan TV show was made near the lake. At that time it was all bamboo and we would play hide and go seek! The Queen Ann Cottage is a must see. The rose garden is beautiful along with the waterfall. But nothing is as special as the peacocks all over the gardens!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancesG_12
50,In a modern world,"Experience glamorous nature without the hike. It can make you forget your in L.A..

And its full of art that any artist can appreciate. I definitely rate this Excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lokik2015
50,Visit this place,"This is a great resource for plant lovers. Full disclosure, I got married in the Rose Garden nearly 30 years ago, so I have a sentimental attachment to the place. Actually, on a recent visit (my adult son, also a plant person, wanted to see it), I was a little disappointed that the honeysuckle arbors were gone--they ringed the garden and added a terrific fragrance to the rose perfume at my wedding. But, in spite of the drought, and the consequent stress on some plantings, and dormant water features, the plantings are gorgeous and fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherimich

40,Bring your walking shoes,"Beautiful gardens, very relaxing. Bring your camera because they have lots of photogenic plants, trees and cacti to be photographed.

There's really only one place to eat but you can bring your picnic basket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd46
50,Come chase the peacocks!,"I am very biased, as I have been a member here for a decade. I greatly enjoy the arboretum no matter what the season, even after the big tree blow-over several years ago. You can chase the peacocks -- not sure you should -- and take lots of pictures as they have little fear of people. You can grab a beverage at the cafe and work for hours at the little outdoor tables. You can walk to above the waterfall and wend your way back down. You can walk in the rose garden or sit quietly watching the lake. You can even do yoga some evenings with a class under the trees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maremel

40,Hot but wonderful,I love being surrounded by interesting plants so I was a happy camper visiting this arboretum. I was there on a very hot day in August but fortunately the have a nice inexpensive tram tour. It went around the whole place and had a docent telling us about the various plants. He was knowledgeable and interesting. As nice as the place was you could tell it was run by a government organization and therefore was suffering from underfunding. Shabby and tired in places. The Huntington by contrast was much nicer and in a better state of repair. if you only could go to one place go to the Huntington.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El0nB

50,A must see if you are in the northern area of Los Angeles,I lived in Altadena for 8 years and going to Arcadia was a 15 minute drive.

I was able to stretch my legs, visit plants and birds, and I was even able to find a private space to meditate under the trees. A favorite spot was the medicinal herb garden. The cafe isn't worth it.

They loved the peacocks that roam the gardens. Sculptures were also on display in some gardens areas. The kids enjoyed seeing these exhibits. We also looked for the 'prehistoric forest' and then 'the house in the woods'. All the exploring kept the three busy exploring for something new around the path. And after exploring, a stop to the cafe for a cool treat ends our trip.The garden is a gem. There are lovely open areas to just lay on the grass and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. I do recommend a visit to these gardens. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prncess803

Especially close to Pasadena, but not very far from downtown (depending on traffic)Good variety of plants, cacti, palms, and medicinal herbs.some plants were not very well labeled, especially in the herb garden. Perhaps the draught is to blame, but the herb garden looked a little shabby overall.There is a large rose garden area, which is gorgeous and smells divine!There are peacocks all over the place, and they make some strange noises, I am used to animals, but I actually found them and all the noises kind of strange.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhodeygem

Full of beauty and history, the grounds are the perfect escape from an otherwise hectic life. The gift shop contains little treasures that are so special. They also have plant sales often. I suggest you purchase an annual pass. Not only do you get the opportunity to walk the grounds, but you also get special hours as a pass holder. Not to mention you also get a discount in the gift shop. Don't forget to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant while you are there. One of my favorite escapes !OH and a bonus!!!

It is a nice place to be outside but the Huntington and Descanso are more beautiful gardens. The highlight is the view from the top of the waterfall. It's worth the walk. Peacocks roam free and cry out like someone moaning for help, a bit disconcerting. You can feel that this garden is managed by the government when you visit the ancient bathrooms and disappointing cafeteria. Our advice is that this is a great place to visit if you are in the neighborhood, but if you are driving out, consider a different destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socali123

Of course, I recognized it immediately when I was told that it was the house they used for the opening scenes of Fantasy Island! We happened to see a link for the tour on the Arboretum's website and it sounded really interesting. And it was incredibly interesting to learn about the history of the Arboretum (it use to be a ranch) and the history of Lucky Baldwin's Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn. That guy was a huge part of San Francisco during the gold rush and basically start Arcadia and built the Santa Anita racetrack. This is a MUST attend tour!

We timed it well as we visited on the third Tuesday of the month a learned that admission was free (regular fee is $9 per adult). We enjoyed the Arboretum especially walking through the different geographic areas. The plants and trees are well labeled and the posted map markers throughout helped to orient us as we made our way through. We didn't have loads of time so we wanted to make sure saw the areas most interesting to us. But one could easily spend several leisurely hours here.

50,Best plant collections all in one place!,"A Good way to spend an afternoon. Quiet, pretty, and affordable. Wild peacocks add additional interest (and noise) to your visit. Some items here are very rare, others pretty common.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesodonnell
40,Bring your Camera,"Spring is the best time to visits the Arboretum; it is not too hot so it is nice to walks around the facility. There is a lot of greenery and a lot of animals are out and about. One of the main attractions are the peacocks that roam free around the park. This is matting season so many peacocks are searching for a peahen companion and attract them by displaying is feathers. This is a great opportunity to take beautiful pictures of their plumage. Just don't get to close to the peacock, while we were there a person wanted to take a picture next to the peacock and it kicked him (That is what happens when you trying to take away the peacock's mojo...)Also, bring some water and comfortable shoes; you will be doing a lot of walking. If you are planning to attend on a hot day, a nice hat, shorts and sun screen are in order. It can get pretty hot, even with all the trees in the area.Visit my site www.travel.gabela.com for more traveling tips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FGTraveler
50,Absolutely beautiful,There are not many places I have been to where you can first take a tram ride and get a throughout explanation of all the areas of this beautiful park. When the tram ride is over you can walk back to the areas that interested you most. Prepare to spend a whole day there just taking in all the beautiful flowers and vegetation. There is a lot of great history surrounding the arboretum. A must see experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaR377
40,A worthy visit,"We spent a pleasant morning walking this large and we'll cared for Park. There is a wide variety of pleasant for those interested, and easy walking trails. The peacocks were stunning. The Arboretum is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WVUNeal
50,Great place to visit,"If you're in to plants and horticulture etc., it's a fantastic place to visit. Lots of walking. It can be quite warm in the summer due to it being in the foothills. Queen Anne's cottage was very interesting and often there's a docent present to give some additional history. Bring some bread it you want to feed the ducks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ca-Frequent-traveler

And of course, a wonderful and varied selection of plants and trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR71
40,A nice walk in the park,"This is a large green space filled with a great variety of plants, trees and shrubs. There are flowers although none were in bloom the day I visited. There are a few water features and animals-peacocks, rabbits, squirrels and many kinds of other birds. There are numerous side trails to explore and get among the trees. The place is really too large to see in it's entirety in one day.There is a cafe and small gift shop. The entrance fee is a reasonable $9 for adults. Bring a camera. It's a great place for a relaxing walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81jeffreyc
40,Good Small-Town Value,"I've loved this place since I was a child playing hide&seek in the bamboo. It's a great place to walk, amble, teach, read, or just admire the flora and fauna. While the flowers and plants are gorgeous, the peacocks are absolutely amazing, and the ducks&geese provide entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashmom1
50,A great walk in the gardens,"We live local and come here all the time to just walk the paths, get some exercise and feel like you have gone way out of town. The site is filled with wonderful trees and plants, some animals -mostly peacocks and the flowers and exhibits change all the time. We easily get a 3 plus mile walk in that that's once around and through the jungle. The family pass is the way to go and they due have a guided tram tour that is very informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMarrs123
50,Nature and education. Relax and enjoy,"I always enjoy walking the paths, visiting the gift shop and learning about the history of beautiful Southern California. This place is grat for families, couple looking for a quiet stroll alone but not isolated, and for those who just wish to walk in beauty and maybe learn a little if the fancy takes you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraJeanS_13
50,Enjoy the nature,"Great getaway from the city. Definitely a nature lovers paradise, maybe even a photographers. Plenty of photo ops. Walk through all the gardens to see what nature has to offer. Over hundreds of flowers and plants. I love to take a blanket with me to lay down and read. Watch out for the peacocks and their poop. There's also a little cafe for a quick bite to eat. On your way out you can also stop at the gift shop or even buy a plant to take home with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melohhhmel
50,Always a nice place to,This is a place you can spend 1/3 a day just looking at all the plants and trees.They also have great summer concerts there .You can take a tram to get a faster over view.Try to remember all the movies filmed there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343randyc
40,Worth a visit anytime of year,"Visited again in late November. Fall came a little late this year, so there was still some nice color as well as fall bloomers about. Given the warm climate in LA, I would have expected to see some neat things going on in the vegetable garden and hugel beds, but they were empty, which was a little disappointing. Also, it seems like they've been working on the adobe forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
50,Don't MISS This Beautiful Historic Place -- Peacocks!,"Honestly. I grew up just a mile from the Arboretum and now I live in Colorado. I try to get back to the Arboretum at least once per year. Take the tram so you can appreciate the botanical oddest AND local history. Every time we go we have such a nice time. I crave the sound of the peacocks yell, and the sight of their beautiful feathers spread out for mating. The last time my husband and I went we took the tram through the botanical exhibits -- the continents of the world, and then after that we walked down through the jungle and amazing rose garden and to look again into the windows of Queen Ann's cottage and the indian village. When you get tired or hot, grab a cool drink at the Arboretum cafe and a sandwich, but if you're hungry don't expect fine cuisine. It's just nice to spend a sunny day there amongst the peacocks and feed the ducks in the lagoon where Fantasy Island was filmed -- de plane, de plane! You will see some amazing trees, shrubs, and flowers. It's lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181emiliep
50,Beautiful,"I drove by this place for years before I finally went in. The place is beautiful. Great place for a wedding. The rose garden is picture perfect, And who doesn't need a picture with a peacock?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miroslavam145
50,A very pleasant couple of hours,"This is an inexpensive way to enjoy a couple of hours outdoors, get in a little walking, and view a wide variety of plant life. Divided into geographical areas, you get a feel for the landscapes of far-off lands. Some of the historical sites are an added plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_in_SD
50,Fantastic,"I have a young cousin who's an arborist in Australia, so I took him to the Arboratum, which I had not visited in more than forty years. We both loved it. It is beautifully maintained, and the variety of plants is amazing. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Great Family place,Beautifuly groomed gardens - wild peacocks . Lovely place to visittrees and flowers from around the world .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175jennyk
40,Peaceful outing,"It has been a number of years since I have been to the Arboretum and while not an attraction for everyone it is a nice the gardens including a rose, herb, tropical and others. Plus various specific environments such as Africa and Australia. A must see are the ponds, waterfall, the Queen Anne Cottage plus tours, a tram, a gift shop and cafe. A tranquil day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debrabeckham
50,"If you love peacocks, this is the place to go!!","I love this place. It gets me away from the big city, and gives me a breather. I have seen great blue herons here, and many ducks, and even a frog. There are many trails to walk, and it is a safe location to do so. I highly recommend their yearly membership which gets you into many other gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrisGo
50,Great place for a walk in the park,"We visited the LA Arboretum twice, because once was not enough to see everything. The first time we went at about 11 am, wish we would have went earlier. We took the noon train to get a feeling for the place, and that was a smart idea. Then we walked around to some of the places that we thought were nice, like the waterfall and the Train Depot. I really enjoyed the depot because of the collection of artifacts and the friendly staff. The first day that we were there we also went through the barn which has some neat stuff wagons and some information about movies. The house looked neat but when we got up there the doors were locked. You can sit on the porch only. There was a succulent show going on when we went the first time, and those plants were super strange looking. Pretty fun. Nice gift shop. The second time we went, we saw the other side. It was more shady at first but then it got hot quick. We were not dressed right and learned our lesson. We only stayed a few hours and then we needed to get out of the sun. Plan accordingly for maximum fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
50,Beautiful gardens for a beautiful wedding,My son had his wedding here. It was the perfect venue. We were surrounded by beauty in all directions(not to mention the bride) . There were peacocks roaming through the area. It was a wonderful evening. On my next visit to California I intend to tour the whole area. The amount of the gardens that we saw were amazing. The staff was very helpful and very polite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calip0rsche
40,Confusing but very nice,"Spent three hours hiking around and didn't see everything. Some very nice areas with interesting vegetation. Might just be me, but didn't find anything following the map as much as stumbled over things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/James3150
50,Beautiful grounds.,Original home of Lucky Baldwin. Many weddings held here which makes a wonderful venue.The outside Sat night music started here with the Pasadena Orchestra. Under the stars it grew do large a crowd it moved to Santa Anita Race park. Ironically also owned by Mr. Baldwin.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billiejob2014
50,Phenomenal!,"What an amazing place! First of all, it is HUGE - if you only have a couple of hours, be sure to look at a map of the facility to plan the areas you want to visit the most. There are tremendous collections of an enormous variety of plants, trees, flowers and grasses; some from other countries (Africa, China, Madagascar, etc.), and some from virtually every climate. There are also beautiful peacocks that roam through parts of the park, which is an added bonus. So many beautiful and thoughtful selections - I would definitely recommend a visit here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SH_NBhome2000H
50,Wonderful Place!,I spent an entire day wondering around the Arboretum & Botanic Garden. It was wonderful. I think I took close to 1000 pictures. I highly recommend this if you love plants and nature. When I arrived to purchase my ticket I was asked how long I wanted to spend and was provided a recommended path to follow throughout the Arboretum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssstich
50,Like my Own Garden,"As a child in the early 60's, I attended wonderful classes here, learning how to grow flowers and vegetables. I recently purchased a membership through Groupon, and I come here at least once a weekend when it opens (8 a.m. for members only). There are only a few other people there to share the lake, the wonderful palms and bamboos, and the waterfall, to name just a few favorite features. Bring water, because there's not much deep shade along the main paths. It's fun to wander down side paths to examine the individual collections . . . Don't miss the Snake Path. Almost every plant you see is clearly marked (somewhere) with common and scientific names and place of origin, in case you fall in love with something and want to get it for your own garden. The tram tour is well worth $5 to introduce you to the layout. Great gift store and good member benefits. The gem of Arcadia!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mizkwebb
50,Beautiful Place,Went on the weekend- very few people in the morning. The gardens are amazing & well marked. Lots of walking- it does get really hot with the sun & pavement. The Queen Anne cottage is great to see- was a cool place to sit & relax for a few min too. Lots of peacocks wandering around also,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffV887
50,Great Spot for Engagment Photos,"Besides it just being a day of exploring the wonderful different species of flowers and plants, taking pictures there is wonderful. Last time we were there we saw peacoks chilling in the parking lot as we walked toward the entrance. One even flew over our heads which I must admit scared us and we dropped to the ground lol looked around to make sure no one was watching and continued to tour the grounds. Our wedding is country chic so for our engagements photos we wanted to go somewhere that looked like we were in a whole different place, a place that took you out of the city vibe. Botanical Gardens was just the place and our pictures were magical. There is a wonderful waterfall in the gardens and a wonderful Victorian house behind a massive pond and it the summer and spring just amazing. I would def recommend for a family outing or a romantic day outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niketac2013
50,A titanic botanic garden,"I believe spring to early summer is the best time to go to this sanctuary. We came here late June and the gardens are all in full bloom. It was a treat to the eyes looking at all the different plants and flowers from different places around the globe. We enjoyed observing the peacocks too, with the male ones displaying their colorful tail to attract the female ones... Don't forget to explore the historic structures like the Queen Anne cottage and the coach barn... Wear comfortable shoes for walking...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
50,Magical venue for concerts,"This review is for one of the Pasadena Pops concerts at the LA County Arboretum. They set out tables on the lawn, and in the back there are cheap lawn seats. Let me say this is a gorgeous place for a concert. What concert venue has peacocks surrounding you? I hate to be all L.A. jaded, but one of the big reasons why I love this place is it is so easy to get to, even from the Westside, and there is free parking across the street at the mall. For the concert, they have free shuttle service from the mall parking area to the concert, even though it's close enough to just walk. As for the seating, the tables they set out are great, with white table cloths. Definitely more comfortable than the Hollywood Bowl, and you're actually pretty close to the stage so you can see their faces, though they still have big screens for people sitting in the back. There are a few food trucks for people to get dinner, but since the Arboretum is across the street from the mall, where there's a Cheesecake Factory, you can get takeout from there and bring it in. I will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VitalSpring
50,Beautiful Gardens and Wonderful People,We attended a wedding here in the Rose Garden and it was gorgeous and so private. Such a lovely time and the employees were so helpful with the coordination. Truly a lovely wedding and gorgeous garden setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crymsin_Blessing
50,Wedding,"We were invited to attend a wedding reception held at the arboretum. This is an amazing and extraordinarily beautiful place. I would love the opportunity to go back and explore the entire gardens for a few days. Also, anyone old enough to remember the TV show Fantasy Island will get a kick out of seeing the Queen Ann Cottage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603ald
50,The greenhouses are my favorite!,"The whole park is very pretty and makes for a relaxing time. However, my favorite things I liked best were the 2 greenhouses (especially the bigger one), the Waterfall, the Butterfly and Herb gardens, and the lily pad pond upstairs (which you enter near the waterfall) as well as the Gorgeous rose garden with trellises and gazebos, and I enjoyed the Oversized water fountain near the entrance.It's also good they have a tram available cause there's too much walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marialeel
50,"Beautiful garden, full of California history","LA County Arboretum is a fantastic garden to stroll through! Plants and trees are arranged regionally, and there are tons of interesting things to look at. Even if you're not a plant person, the whole atmosphere is like a park and there are great spaces just to stroll or hang out. There are also tons of wildlife. The colorful peacocks and peahens are prominent throughout the arboretum, and even in adjacent neighborhoods.The house from the '80s TV series Fantasy Island is located here. The Queen Anne Cottage was built by Lucky Baldwin, an early western pioneer and prominent CA businessman, for his guests. Other historic structures include his much more modest adobe home and a beautiful Victorian style barn you have to see to believe. His horses lived in fancier quarters than he did!Admission is $9 for adults, $5 for kids, and free for kids under 5. My only complaint is they only accept cash, which is a pain, but no big deal. In summer, Michael Feinstein and the Pasadena Pops Symphony play concerts in the amphitheater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/octrekster
50,"LOVED IT SO MUCH, visited it again, the NEXT day !","We live on the other side of the continent so we knew we had one opportunity to visit these lovely grounds. We spent parts of two days taking photos and enjoying the peace and quiet. The gardens are neat and the trees and shrubs are labeled for those of us who care that the tree is from South Africa or New Zealand (there IS a FLOSS tree found near the Queen Anne Cottage Not found in the US - go look for it). There is a lovely shop where you may purchase lotions, oils, etc. I would suggest hats, sunscreen and water bottles. Spend some time enjoying our beautiful world. We spent at least two hrs on the second day watching the peacocks - they are so beautiful. This place is definitely worth a day of your time. (There is a $9 admission fee.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39patriciaw
40,A good place to stroll,"Live nearby but never had he chance to visit until now. A good place for a leisurely walk. The place lacks trees that can provide more shades. The good side, peafowl all over the place. The cafe serves freshly made sandwiches that is reasonably priced. A good place to spend time with family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neborr357
50,An Easy Walk in the Park!,"If like to stroll, this is a beautiful, peaceful setting. You‚Äôll discover plants and trees from all over the world as you wander along paths through the garden either with a docent-led or a self-guided walking tour. There is a 30 minute, $5 tram tour that operates Saturday and Sunday at noon, 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm *Among the gardens on your walk is the Aquatic Garden, a serene landscape of gentle pools, water lilies and benches, a lush rose garden, a tropical house with several thousand orchids, flowering trees, a water conservation garden and an herb, fruit and vegetable garden. The Arboretum is an official wildlife sanctuary. There are resident and migratory birds, but for me the best part of the visit is watching those gorgeous peacocks roam around the park displaying their fabulous multicolored feather fans. (approach with caution‚Ä¶they are still wild!)You‚Äôll also learn about California history on your journey. Hugo Reid, a Scottish expatriate/ advocate for native Americans was the first owner; in 1886 the maverick millionaire Elias ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù Baldwin built the historic Queen Anne Cottage, seen in several Hollywood movies. You can plan your visit with the garden map online. The Arboretum is across from the Santa Anita Mall and just a few miles from the Huntington Library and Museum if you want to make a day of it.Admission: $9.00 for adults, Students and Seniors $6.00, Children Ages 5-12 $4.00, children under 5 free. Open daily 9:00 am - 5:00 pm* NOTE: Tram tour may be cancelled because of weather.

40,Fun for all ages,"My in laws live in San Gabriel so they make it a point to take out of town guests to this attraction. The peacocks are such a fun feature. They really add to the gardens. My 1 year old and their 2.5 year old LOVED them. Bring the strollers, sunscreen, waterbottles and enjoy. We had lunch at the cafe which was a nice treat. Excellent burgers, quesadilla, and thai noodle salad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7801AJjuliat
50,Peacocks and Gorgeous Gardens,"Great for a walk in the diverse gardens. The peacocks are fun to watch as well. Queen Anne cottage are is worth visiting and interesting piece of history for the area. There are special events to do here as well.Parking is at the arboretum.(Note: For those who want to combine it with other activities, it is close to the Santa Anita Racetrack, shopping, as well as a few miles over Huntington Library in San Marino).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Peaceful gardens in Arcadia,"We have enjoyed a senior membership for the Arboretum for several years and adore visiting. We take long, peaceful walks among the plants, waterfalls and lakes. The Arboretum is invigorating. We bring our grandchildren whenever possible to learn to appreciate nature and enjoy the beauty of this gem. Recently, we brought our two year old granddaughter for her first visit. She loved the ""pea hawks"". She walked for over two hours, totally enthralled with the plants and wildlife. What a magnificent place to visit. The home and barn are special. Lovely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaandGene

50,"Plants, Plants, and More Plants","I visited the Arboretum several times recently, although I only saw a fraction of the large gardens. Seeing it over a period of a few weeks, the recent drought had taken its toll and then a large rain storm filled Baldwin Lake and all the plants came alive again. Geese were everywhere spending the winter in a warmer climate and the peacocks were displaying their plumage.I find the Arboretum a relaxing way to spend a few hours. There are also several historic buildings on the site including the Queen Anne Victorian used in many motion pictures and television projects, the adobe, and a train station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

50,Great Year Around,"Even when everything isn't in bloom this is glorious. A great place for a stroll or hike. We went all through the area including by the house where we peaked into the windows and wished we could explore. The vistas are fabulous. The green grass, palm trees, flowering bushes and mountains in the distance.To top it off - peacocks!Beautiful year around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEVenturer
40,Nice Place to See Spring Flowers,Went there in the spring for the first time. Lots of pretty flowers as well as peacocks. It's a very nice place for a walk and it's about 3 miles to walk around the whole garden. We will definitely go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joy4ever
50,Quintessential Relaxation Visit,"If you want to ""get away from it all,"" this is the place to visit. No traffic to be heard, no meaningless chatter, nothing but peace and tranquility. Queen Anne's Cottage, featured in Fantasy Island (da plane, da plane) is in quite contrast to Elias ""Lucky"" Baldwin's humble abode. Behind the cottage is a good sized lawn to sit and take in the flora and fauna but beware of the geese, they will attack and run you off. A little distance away is the jungle that will have your senses on high alert for Charlie but it's actually the film location for many Tarzan movies starring Johnny Weissmuller. The sum of the matter: if you want peace and quiet along with a slight bit of solitude, here's where you want to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldschool1946
50,"Arboretum- Arcadia, Ca.","Every child and adult should see this lovely garden, the Lucky Baldwin Home and the grounds of this County Arboretum. The history of this place is amazing. Many flower shows are held here, concerts and even movie making. It is a must for all.I have helped schools get field trips to this wonderful attraction to insure that they have a chance to see this beauty. There are trams for those who can't walk, but most can do it. Best times to visit are before the heat , if the weather is hot.There is a cafe for drinks and light lunch. Oh, I almost forgot the peacocks- everywhere are their tails spread out and their calls in mating. Sometimes you can witness the babies of the peacocks- always something is interesting.Canada geese roam the grounds as if they own the place, and you can hear their hoots. So much to tell, but do go for a trip to the Los Angeles County Arboretum- in Arcadia, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pollyparker2014

40,LIKE PEACOCKS? YOU'LL LOVE THE ARBORETUM!,"I hadn't been to our famous Arboretum since I was a child - and that's a looooong time ago. It's a lovely place for a long, open-air walk on a sunny day. Thousands of exotic flowers and trees, a lagoon and a small waterfall, and many peacocks take one out of the usual Southern California milieu and into another world. (NOTE: I was there in 2012, prior to a major storm that damaged much of the greenery, from what I read, but hopefully, it's back to normal by now.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrisW536
40,"Great walk...lots of history here, and flowers too!","This is a great place to take a nice walk. The gardens are well kept and diverse.

40,Impressive,"You do not realize how large this place is until you take the tram ride in the afternoon. Took the grandkids and they loved it. The peacocks smelled crackers and followed us around. The trees and plant are marked and each set of gardens are from a different part of the world. The ""Fantasy Island"" house was a highlight. Fully decorated inside. Great way to spend half a day getting exercise and being in nature in the middle of the suburbs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tony32580
50,"Beauty in the middle of Arcadia, CA!","I visit this place every time I visit my uncle who lives in the area. Each visit, there is something different to see. I love the blooming cacti and the fragrant jasmines everywhere. This place is idea for the plant and bird lover. There were birds weaving in and out of the trees and cacti. I could recognize only a handful of birds. Of course there were the beautiful peacocks everywhere! The weather was just perfect, around 78 degrees with lots of sun. Perfect for taking photos of the vegetation. I posted quite a few on FB to the amazement of family and friends. Might I say, they were jealous!! You can never get too much ""nature"" which helps to lift the spirits! There is also a nice gift shop if you're looking for something different and special to give as gifts. I will keep coming back as long as this place continues to exist! Great place to visit with children and elderly folks. Make sure you bring water, though water fountains were strategically placed. It also doesn't hurt to have some snacks if you are planning to stay for a few hours. Since there was lots of sun in January, I would also recommend a hat for sun protection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8umble8ee
50,The ideal break.,"If you can subtly scuttle the usual stuff like museums of art and science, particularly when in the company of sub teens, you may definitely want to take a drive to this exotic venue and get your fill of nature in the most serene of environments. Even the peacocks accept you for what you are, so long as you let them be what they are.Extremely well planned and maintained, this is both a great learning experience and plenty of fun for persons of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJPhilip
50,Lovely place to stroll or to power walk!,"The L.A. Arboretum is such a treasure. It is divided into different ""habitats"" for the wide variety of plants. One of my favorite places to go is the building with the orchids - fabulous blooms! We discovered a beautiful waterfall in one area which is a great picture taking opportunity. There are beautiful peacocks roaming the grounds. The ""Peacock Cafe"" lives up to it's name with peacocks relaxing in various parts of the outside patio. While there, stop and enjoy a cup of China Mist tea and take in the surroundings. We went to the Queen Ann's Cottage for one of the rare tours at Christmastime and it was enchanting. Put on your walking shoes and make a point of visiting this fabulous place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PasadenaTess

50,Wonderful Gardens,The Arcadia Arboretum has been well established for years. But it has grown increasingly more fabulous over the years. The grounds have been extended and the various gardens are a please to walk in and explore. It is a must visit for people of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurie7544
40,Lovely nature walks and great place for family pics,"I've visited on several occasions as this place has lovely grounds. I recommend a minimum of two hours as there is so much to see. They do offer a $5 tram ride if you prefer not to walk so much. Admission is free on third Tuesday of the month which I take advantage of to save but there is no tram this day. There are quite a few lovely spots in this huge botanical garden for great photos. There are fountains, a lake, a waterfall spot. Great color and foliage delight the senses of all ages and I'll definitely be coming back. If you visit, my tip is to bring good shoes, sunscreen, water, and your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Welcome to Fantasy Island!,"This place is absolutely huge, well manicured and beautiful. The Queen Anne cottage (Victorian) is the site of many television shows and movies. This includes the television show Fantasy Island and also the film Meet the Fockers. However, in Meet the Fockers, the cottage is painted green. Fun to walk around but all outdoors and can be rather warm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
40,Beautiful November Morning Walk,"I have lived in SoCal all my life and had never visited before, but I will definitely go back. The place is extensive, peaceful and green. Really enjoyed the orchids, the Cottage and the view of the mountains beyond. The walk was great exercise for this time of year, not too hot. Informative and inspirational. We got many new ideas for our patio and garden at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelScott2013
40,A good way to kill some time,"Good selection of plant, however it is very spread out and gets very hot, remember the water and the walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jdb566
40,warrants multiple visit! Much to see!!,"5.29.12 - wished we had more time for a more leisurely visit. 127 acres is a bit much to take in in a hot Spring afternoon. To fully appreciate make multiple visits and time them according to areas of special interests: The Perennial Garden, the Americas, Prehistoric Forests, Africa, Australia etc. I regret I didn't note the names of the flowers and plants I photographed.Pack a lunch and watch the geese and their young frolic about on the greens and the lake. . There are picnic tables at the edge of the parking lot in the shade of overhanging trees for bigger groups.Ironically the Arboretum's website was not very informative or user-friendly so I looked up more detailed facts on Wikipedia. I was hoping to identify the plants via photos on their website. Did you know that portions of 2 Jurassic Park was filmed here and so did some Tarzan adventures! Nice! I assumed they were filmed in the Prehistoric Forest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Beautiful gardens!,"My wife and I love this place and we keep coming back. Get your walking shoes on and enjoy the beatiful plants, trees and flowers. It is relaxing and a learning experience. Take the day off and come here and afterward go have a nice meal you will need it after the walking but it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doggiedaddie
50,A world of plants in 127 acres,"This is a world unto itself, including exotics like the spiny forests of Madagascar & Eucalyptus groves of Australia. If it's a blazing hot Southern California day, there are plenty of shady areas to take shelter. My favorite are the bamboo forest and the tropical hillside along the waterfall. Kids will love to get lost in the criss-crossing winding trails through the prehistoric forest. The peacocks and peahens are fun to watch, especially when there are chicks bobbing along behind them. Plan on spending a whole morning or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Callejera1
50,Great getaway,"I have visited the Arboretum many times, and always enjoy the peaceful and quiet surroundings in the heart of a bustling city. The variety of gardens means you are very likely to find one that pleases you. Depending on the season, you may find flower shows, such as roses or orchids, always worth a stroll. Be sure to visit the out of the way gardens and hot houses to see unusual plants, often in bloom.Don't mist the museums, including the former residences and the train station. Lucky Baldwin, the second owner, was a colorful character in Calif history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RenoBill
50,"One of the most important (and pleasant, and interesting) places in Los Angeles County!","From native American sites, to adobe structures, to Lucky Baldwin's 19th century gingerbread constructions--not to mention the green open spaces, trees, and flowers! As you walk along the paths, and look north across informal gardens to the San Gabriel Mountains in the background, you should know that you are just few miles from the Mission San Gabriel (1771). A small group walked from the Mission to found the Pueblo of Los Angeles in 1781. But you can forget all of that if you wish, and enjoy a quiet walk. Watch for special summer symphony concerts, and educational opportunities for children and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gamocha
40,Beautiful Well-maintained Gardens,"It's hard to believe that it took a few decades of living in Los Angeles before I visited these gardens. The gardens are beautifully maintained. There are some wonderful exotic trees & plants. This is a nice and peaceful place to hang out at for the afternoon. You might consider calling in advance of visiting to confirm hours of operation. Their website says they close at 4:30pm...and when we arrived today, we learned they were closing at 3:30pm....not the best when you arrive at 2:00 expecting the extra time. (We were allowed to stay til 4:00...but no tickets are sold after 3:30).Another thing worth researching, which we did not know about before arriving is that the arboretum is host to symphony concerts. In fact, this is why the gardens were closing early. They needed their staff for organizing the show. They put up a shell for the musicians. This looks like something very fun to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,Lots of pretty vegetation and peaceful,"It's like a zoo for plants rather than animals. It's very pretty with many exotic species. I would like to check it out during different seasons to see how the foliage differs throughout the year. Nice and clean. Good for romantic couples and the whole family, though very young kids would probably be bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickeyE_13
10,Hang on to your wallet,"Thinking of visiting the Arboretum? Hang on to your cash, arboretum Tim Phillips and Dr. Wourm's 'lost' 4.5 million dollars in cash * and * their ""water leak"" destroyed the evidence of the lost cash. Wourms is in Kentucky arboretum handling public cash, arboretum Tim Phillips still at the Arboretum handling public cash. Go see the Huntington or just throw your cash down a toilet at the Arboretum.The Arboretum brags they have 17,000 species - in database only, most have died or are neglected, the trash that is left is a 'county park with no golf greens'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morgane153
50,Huge ... only walked part & LOVED IT!,"Despite 100 degree heat, my family and I walked through several gardens and enjoyed all of it. Even in August, there is plenty to see and appreciate, with everything kept up beautifully. It is a nature photog's paradise w/ cacti, palms, water lilies, peacocks, ponds, lagoons, and such human-made features as a Victorian Swiss cottage, fountains, and fireplaces. Worth the drive to Arcadia!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
50,Peaceful!,This place is so relaxing and peaceful! It's like those ad pictures for yoga and retreat places in magazines. The different areas of gardens and specialized plants is interesting. The vast areas of grass and trees makes for great areas of meditation. It's just a great place to stroll and relax. It's very educational for adults. The children I saw weren't really excited all that much but when they were out on the grassy areas they looked like they had a blast. If you need to get away for relaxation this is the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532MikeG
50,Awesome,"Awesome place to visit and spend an afternoon. Lots of grounds to walk and take it all in. The landscaping is wonderful. The birds and critters are wonderful. It's just a beautiful, peaceful and very calming place to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninee
40,Part of Birthday gift celebration from my family,"Prior to our Lunch date, we visited this Botanical Garden Name Arboretum. I am glad we visited this place. For the 1st time I saw a variety of plants that I never saw them before. I visited many Botanical Gardens already in the past but seeing a new variety of Plants and Trees makes me wonder, there must be unseen variety of plants or never discovered yet. In addition there are attraction that might surprise one like a small Waterfall, lakes and variety of Tropical Trees from different Countries like Australia, Madagascar, etc. Lakes attracted more my attention considering the fish that are familiar to our fish pond at the backyard especially during the feeding time. Fish are really desperate to get their parts which entertained one in the way they grabbed their foods. There are variety of Fish and Turtles in the lake that one never notice a considerable time was spent already on said attraction.Money spent is worth seeing this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lib8543
50,Best place in the LA area to walk,"For a beautiful walk, go to the Arboretum, you will not be disappointed. Lovely trees of course and so much more. Upon entering, there is a large grassy area frequented by Canada geese that is like a central hub. Wide paved walkways lead you in several directions throughout the expansive property. Most of the area is relatively flat so it is easy for all ages. There are trees of every size and shape and smell and taste you can imagine. But my first stop is always the greenhouse, it is filled with stunning orchids. Next a shady walk down one of the little roads. You can follow a map if you wish. There are markers with the names and origins of many of the trees and plants. So if you see something unusual, you can stop and read about it. There are also several ponds and a small lake to explore. There is also a very pretty waterfall and little streams complete with bridges. If you look closely, you can spot turtles on the shores and a variety of ducks. Don't be surprised if you get a glance of a heron or two. In fact, it is a great place to bird watch, bring your binoculars. There are a couple of buildings to see, the barn and the Victorian house that some will recognize from the old series Fantasy Island. Such a pretty sight. The grassy area and large swaying palm trees in front of the house make for a great spot for taking photos. Not far from the house there is a rose garden, quite lovely and fragrant. Some of these areas are not paved so it may be a little bit harder to push a stroller or wheelchair, but still it can be done. There are plenty of benches spaced through the area to stop and rest if need be. It's also nice to just sit and enjoy the peace and view. It is a great place to bring the family both young and old. There is also a tram ride for a few dollars if you want to hear more information about the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annieb318
50,Fun Day,"Nice alternative to the Huntington, and even at full price it's just $9. Plants interesting, buildings more so. Good walk around place. Try to go when the rail depot is open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglandScotland

50,Beautiful place to visit,"They have different eco systems to view, and each one is a beauty to walk through. The peacocks are gorgeous birds. I saw one attacking his reflection in the bumper of a work truck once! The Arboretum is an amazing place to visit. It is an island of tranquility - almost unbelievable in the midst of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamantine
40,Lovely place for a long and peaceful walk,"The Arboretum has a phenomenal number of woody plant species arranged into ecosystems from many parts of the world. There are few guided tours, so this is pretty much a do-it-yourself thing. Many of the plants are labeled if it is important to you to know the species. But if you are not a botanist, I recommend it as a lovely place to take a long peaceful walk, maybe have lunch (there is a snack bar, and I think you can bring food in). Parking is free and easy. There are peacocks all over, and a huge fountain near the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilibro

All of us enjoyed the Arboretum immensely, but Eric's tour was the highlight!!! So much is in bloom just now! Go! Get outdoors! Enjoy nature!(tip: get your tram tickets right when you arrive)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureReady
50,Definitely worth a visit,"My husband and I finally stopped here for a visit. It began unofficially the evening before when we arrived just after it'd closed on Saturday.Two female peacocks had a few peachicks with them, outside the gate, digging in the leaves for grub. My telephoto lens was ready to go!On Sunday it was very humid and warm, so I ran out of energy before we got through the whole garden.It's a very nice facility with a wide variety of plants/vegetation/trees. Most plants have markers to identify them.To my delight, I turned a corner and found a male peacock in full display of his amazing feathers. A couple other people were snapping pictures. It seems he was accustomed to people taking his photo.We'd like to come back in spring and see the different foliage and blooms.Definitely worth a stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaLovesPaul
40,Free every 3rd Tuesday,We enjoyed a FREE day at the Arboretum on the third Tuesday of the month. Free parking is always a nice thing. The Arboretum has a beautiful rose garden and lots of plants and blooms to look at and enjoy during a nice walk around the grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tab4ever
30,Better to see in the spring when flowers are blooming,"This time of year does not provide the opportunity to see many of the plants they have in bloom. Tram/Bus which is usually available to go through the arboretum was not available. Tropical building was nice, but many plant tags were not visible. More signs along the pathways would have been helpful. The map was not especially helpful. Gift shop was lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrananMike
40,"Beautiful gardens! Also houses the lovely Queen Anne cottage where some of ""Fantasy Island"" was filmed.",This arboretum is so large that you can get lost & while away the day here!

50,Super,"We have been going there for over fourty yeas and yet enjoy it again and again. We had time to kill on this trip and up to the Arboretum it was. Entry is not free anymore as it used to be, but $ 6.00 per Senior, $ 8.00 regular is well worth it. It really is an Oasis within the busy L.A. area, close to the Santa Anita Racetrack and the Huntington Shopping Mall. For hours and hours one can enjoy the various plants and trees which are located by geographical area. The peacocks, geese and ducks are a delight. There are herb gardens, rose gardens, it's endless. The Queen Ann Cottage and the Carriage House were closed off and one can only peek through the windows. Not sure if that's something new, in the old days these buildings could be entered. On the way out check out the gift shop.Highly recommend for some peaceful and relaxing times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WEISSBIER
50,"Gardens, gardens, gardens","The Huntington Library is well known for its marvelous botanical gardens. Close by, maybe 25 minutes by surface, 15 by freeway is the stunning LA Arboretum. This is a lovely place with a Queen Anne cottage, stable, etc. There are peacocks strutting around making harsh sounds in contrast to their splendid plumage. A great place for kids, for singles to stroll, couples to enjoy a waterfall! The lunchroom is nuts and bolts, but has surprisingly fresh sandwiches. Nothing pretentious, but a nice snack bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eenerknirb
50,An Oasis,"Have been here several times and never get tired of it. A wide variety of plants, something always in bloom.

40,"Relaxing, Beautiful Place Hiding in the City","Visited the arboretum and botanic garden yesterday and had no idea how peaceful and pretty it was! You would never know it was sitting in the middle of Arcadia, near the Santa Anita racetrack. The orchid house was absolutely beautiful and the grounds were so pretty, with a waterfall, ponds for the ducks and turtles, and plenty of well-placed benches if you want to relax and eat or drink while taking in the views. It was so interesting to see all the types of plants that grow in other countries too. The gift shop had great bird-themed gifts too. I would recommend this place to everyone, but especially for bird/nature enthusiasts, families with kids, or those who want to get away for a peaceful stroll to escape everyday stress. Definitely a hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaBCalifornia

50,If You like Very Lovely Gardens,"Los Angeles is an amazing place. On our way back to Los Angeles from Desert Hot Springs, we stopped here. It was crowdedBecause it was Saturday. This is a horticultural wonderland. The place is divided into geographic locations....so see the stuff that grows in Madagascar and then look at Australian plants. There are lovely ponds with a variety of water birds, a waterfall, and beautiful fountains. THere is an old ranch house to explore and a small fragrant orange grove next to the rose garden. This is a special place. Make sure you visit if you are traveling to LA. I have been here twice and am amazed by the Chinese Orchid trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingrm

But overall a really great place for a picnic an d to just relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanceL_13
40,Hidden Gem in Los Angeles!,"We visited the Arboretum March 2, 2013 and really enjoyed it. Very well kept up and every tree & bush was identified and from what country it is native. Never knew there were so many different varities of trees. There is a well paved pathway for those with strollers or needing to walk on a level surface as well as dirt trails to explore other plants. There are beautiful peacocks throughout as well as ducks & geese. Beautiful ponds and waterfalls with turtles. There is the Queen Anne Cottage to checkout and the tropical greenhouse makes you feel as if you stepped into Hawaii. There is also a tram offered but we walked and was able to do this in 2 hours. Then stop and eat at the Peacock Cafe and sit outside with the peacocks. Free parking but get there early. We arrived right after it opened and it was fairly light but when we left around noon the parking lot was pretty full. There are benches throughout to sit and take in the beauty. Even if you're not a plant person I recommend seeing this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
20,Where am I and What is That,"We managed to see only half of this place because we spent most of our time trying to figure out where we were. I have never seen an arboretum that had so little signage. There was the occasional ""you are here"" but most intersections were void of that information. In addition, there was very little information naming the plants, with the possible exception of the aloe trail. The Tallac Knoll Trail was particularly devoid of information. In addition, the Tallac Knoll trail is ADA unfriendly unless you decide to turn around and go back the same way you climbed up. Otherwise, the trail down is very steep and hard to negotiate with a wheelchair...check your brakes!We might have stayed longer after a lunch break, but the Peacock Cafe was closed on Monday. The park is popular for walkers, but I came away very frustrated at how much better this place could be if I knew what I was looking at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEC24
50,The peacocks rock!,"I having been visiting the Los Angeles Arboretum regularly for over 60 years. It is still fun to see where Tarzan was filmed and to make sure the Victorian cottage that was in Fantasy Island is being maintained. The gardening classes are always great. Check the schedule to see the classes that are being offered.The peacocks that roam, sometimes they think they own, the grounds are great. They squak over nothing, perhaps they see their shadow, but add character to the Arboreteum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,"Thank you, Lucky Baldwin and Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation","The L.A. County Arboretum and Botanical Garden is a wonderful spot to spend 30 minutes or a full day in the San Gabriel Valley. It has a natural lake, tropical forest, Australian forest, a man-made waterfall, and lots of peacocks. The views from Tallac Knoll are beautiful. One gets a good sense of history from Baldwin's two houses -- one used only by his wife for entertaining -- and the grand stables. Those of us who live in the vicinity are so grateful to have three wonderful botanical gardens in the West San Gabriel Valley. The Arboretum is not to be missed. There is a small cafe, so one can replenish the inner human being, as long as one has brought enough cash money to do so: they don't take any credit cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waldorf2012

Most arboretums I've been to seem to specialize in local plantings but in Arcadia, we saw Australian desert-like foliage and also beautiful tropical foliage near one of the lakes.

Ducks, squalls and big fish are on the move and so will you. Light rolling grounds. No steep trails. BUT........hot in the summer. There are overhanging forage along the way giving relief from the rays. The area is a bit of a smog catcher being so close to a mountain range and about 30 plus miles from the ocean influence (cooling effect). Go; relax.....ah.

30,Nice Place to Walk Around,"The Arboretum has several types of gardens over 127 acres. It is a great place to walk and get some exercise! There are some nice photo ops here (baby ducks in the spring, etc.), but I was somewhat disappointed in the Arboretum overall. It appeared to me that the budget woes that have affected many California state & county parks have caused problems here, as well. Many areas could have used more attention to maintenance & cleanliness. That said, I do recommend viewing & photographing the Queen Anne Cottage from across the lake, the Wayberg Waterfall, and the beautiful peacocks.The 3rd Tuesday of every month has free admission. Parking is free, as well. Bring comfy shoes and bread for the ducks!The racetrack at Santa Anita Park is across the street, and the Westfield Mall at Santa Anita is down the street. The mall food court is an option for eating after walking around the Arboretum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedcampgirl
50,"Great for little ones, families and friends.","This is such an institution, where the old Tarzan movies were filmed and the Queen Anne's cottage served as the visual backdrop for the 80's sitcom ""Fantasy Island""I came here as a child, wandering around the lake, feeding the ducks and the peacocks and the hungry fish in the lakes, often just sitting on a tree stump and staring. It was great to view it as a child. I took my kids here, we did many of the same things, throwing bread to the ducks, or watch the fish just team up gobbling the bread crumbs. I remember seeing wood ducks, Canadian geese, Mallard ducks, herons, egrets, and coots. The Peacocks are king here. They are the official bird of Arcadia, and gorgeous. They have a call like that of a screaming cat which, if I do say so myself I can mimic very well, because I grew up in Arcadia and it was fun to do the birdcalls. Bring comfy shoes to walk in, a sandwich to enjoy or catch a bite in the onsite cafe.Walk around the lake and peek in to Queen Anne's cottage area, or the adobe huts of Rancho Santa Anita.In the summer the Arboretum hosts concerts in the park, and many weekend classes and events, including various annual cactus sales, or kids classes. This is a great respite in the middle of a bustling city, and you deserve a few hours to absorb, reflect and renew.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aswessen
50,A Beautiful Spring Day!,"The Arboretum was in fine form today. The birds were out , the fowers were blooming and there was a family of Canadian geese with 5 little babies following behind the mother brought up by the dad at the end. It was so sweet to see the family of geese.The waterfall looked spectacular, there was no fish in the pond by the fall, but in the big lake, there were plenty of generational Koi. ( Koi that are left to the wild revert back to the natural grey color).The Australian section had some very fragrant Eucalyptus varieties, but it did appear that the winter winds had done a number on a few of the trees.The Orchid greenhouses were pretty and definitely worth the visit.A wonderful place to go on a date or with your family.The old house located on the property still looked fabulous, it is the house that was used on the ""Fantasy Island"" show years ago.You can look in the windows, but it would be nice if you could go inside.The old house still had the same colorful stained-glass windows. They were in the middle of re-doing the barn so it was not open today.There are a lot of ponds and fish in most of them. The big lake had many turtles that would eat bread crumbs.It costs 8 dollars per person for entry and worth the price.There are not too many bathrooms located around...so go when you first get there because it is along walk back to the restroom.There seems to be great wheelchair access for the handicapped and a nice smooth road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seaduck777
40,A delightful and peaceful mixture of native oak woodland and ornamental gardens,"We only had a couple of hours to spend at the arboretum on this, our first visit. As a forest ecologist, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the grove of rare, native Engelmann oaks and being able to talk with the curator responsible about regeneration problems facing these oaks and some related research projects they are conducting. Our family also enjoyed the citrus grove and saw enough of other collections and exhibits that we know to come back on future trips. On the afternoon we visited, admission was free, so there were many visitors, but it didn't feel crowded. All in all, a delightful respite from traffic and the noise of the city and a great place to see and learn about trees and other plants!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65Rambler

You can honestly take anyone there - boy/girl friend, family, friends and unless they have an aversion to nature, they will love it. It has a waterfall path and beautiful lake, great for photographers and tourists. I got some great pictures and love the atmosphere! Plan on going back soon.

This is about the 4th or 5th time that we went to the Arboretum, and I have to say that we are never disappointed.Even though it was winter time, and the area was hit very hard by recent wind storms in November, the Arboretum was still very beautiful, especially the green houses that are filled with flowering orchids and other exotic tropical plants. We were truly impressed with the green houses. It was as if we walked into a magical, fantasy land filled with color.The grounds themselves are immaculate, in spite of the wind storm damage, and it was very pleasurable just to walk around, take in nature, do some bird watching and enjoy the silence that was only broken by the singing of birds.Since our last visit, nice walking paths were added. My daughters truly were amazed with the arboretum, and I know that they had a great time. We were able to cover 90% of the arboretum in about 3 hours.

Every time we are in Los Angeles, my wife and I try to take a long walk around the the arboretum along its long, winding, paved paths, to relax, enjoy the beauty and transquility, and to learn about the flowers and trees. We once even spoted a gray fox chasing a goose by a pond, not far from the water fall. (the goose managed to fly away in the nick of time!)  One can easily squeeze 2+mi walk around the park.By the way, on Dec 01, Santa Ana windstorm felled 400+ huge trees, and damaged almost 1000 trees!  Thanks to the wonderful volunteers and their dedicated staff, the park was re-opened to the public in record time! We visited the park in late Dec, we were very impressed with the great job they had done to clean up and repair the park!This park is handicap friendly. There is also a free sight-seeing trolley going around the park. Kids and grandparents alike will love it! Its definitely worth its admission charge. They also have some interesting and educational programs and workshops for adults and children. We love the arboretum so much that we signed up as members, even we don't live in Los Angeles.

This is the largest public arboretum in the US and the comparatively modest admission (8$ per adult, 3$ per child) will help upkeep this jewel. Plants are arranged by continents/regions; we took a narrated ""train"" tour through the large gardens for an extra fee and then wandered around independently. It is very well maintained, plants and trees are usually well-labeled with both common and Latin names. Even on a weekend (with free parking almost filled to the last space) it did not feel very crowded. There is a souvenir shop onsite with plants, books, Tshirts, icecream, etc. - very friendly and accommodating staff. Peacocks and hens with chicks are freely roaming the grounds.

I took hundreds of photos - so bring a camera. You will need flat shoes so you can really make the most of your visit - however, there are buggies and a sort of little road train if you aren't able to walk too far. Lots for children to see and do - even a children's garden and there are birds, insects, lizards, turtles and fish to keep them entertained. There are lots of peacocks in the park and we saw peahens with little chicks - highlight of the day.I would thoroughly recommend it - you could spend a whole day here and bliss out completely.

The waterfall, rose garden, and Lake Baldwin are just a few of the highlights. The Queen Anne's cottage is also worth a look. They do need to repair some of the building floors as well as the rectangular pool area, but otherwise they do a good job of upkeep on the flora.

40,A Visual Delight and Peaceful Refuge,"We recently moved to the area and went to the LA County Arboretum this past autumn. It was an overcast cool day so we had the place mostly to ourselves. We took many paths of the 120+ acres and were constantly delighted by unique plants, and so much of the natural beauty including the picturesque San Gabriel's that surround the area. The peacocks and birds were entertaining and the small cafe with the outdoor area was delightful.All in all we enjoyed it so much we bought a pass and look forward to going back every season. The parking is free and easily accessible. The gift shop has a kind and knowledgeable man who on that day kindly welcomed us with some free hot cider and cookies.My ONLY suggestion is that they better map certain areas. We went up the hill beyond the waterfalls and got a bit lost coming back down taking a different path. The map up there was not all that helpful and we were not given a map when we came in. It would be great if they could better mark and/or color code paths so that you could know which one goes where and what they have.So wear your most comfortable shoes and enjoy, cause this is well worth the trip and you can spend many hours here. Considering it is less than the cost of a 2 hour movie it is a terrific deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbgirlLA
50,All American in Arcadia,"A topographic map would better suit a person in seeing the true dimensions of this lovely place. I went on a Sunday and found it pleasantly empty. A perfect place for solo photographers, young lovers, or small families. The Aloe walkway, the Spiny path (featuring spiny plants from Madagascar) and the lilly pads at the top of the California oak tree hill were my personal favorites. The peacocks were spread thinly throughout, each basking in its separate glory. I fed a few before reading the pamphlet which pleads with folks to not feed any animals inside the botanical gardens. Great place!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forgottensage
50,LA Arboretum- definitely worth an afternoon!,"We went to the Arboretum to kill some time while we were in the area. We ended up having a fantastic time! Not only are there tons of plants and trees, but there are peacocks EVERYWHERE you look, and they are certainly not shy. Also, there's a waterfall, a lake with ducks, and a cottage with a great story.A few notes though: bring a student ID if you are one, they didn't advertise the discount on their website. Also, if you can, bring a loaf of bread or some crackers to feed the ducks. We didn't do this because we had no idea there even were ducks, but once the ducks see people they quickly swim toward shore and come up to you. But be prepared to share some with the squirrels. Also, if you're planning on eating lunch at the Peacock Cafe, make sure you're either not picky or have plenty of CASH on you (they don't accept credit/debit). They have a few things there, but next time we go we'll be bringing lunch with us.A few notes though: bring a student ID if you are one, they didn't advertise the discount on their website.

The Queen Anne Cottage, a Victorian mansion, does not seem to be open to visitors, but you can view the various rooms through the windows. The rooms are beautifully period decorated and furnished in the Victorian era. There is also a library, gift shop and cafe for your enjoyment.

50,A Poem on the Arboretum & Botanic Garden,"We went today to this beautiful place,it will be a memory you won't erase.The rose garden took my breath away,it was a place I'd love to stay.We saw peacocks wandering around the flowers,they seemed like creatures with magical powers.They posed for the cameras like models in a magazine,it was one of the coolest moments I've ever seen.Did you know they cry out really loud?They are showing that they are really proud.There were plants and flowers that I didn't know exist,I watched hummingbirds zoom bye sucking on their mist.The hummingbirds danced and flew bye so fast,the memories of them in my mind will last.Remember it's cash only to get in and to buy your snacks,and I just want to tell you the facts.There's a rest room there in case you have to go,and the free parking is nice if you don't have a lot of dough.It's a great place to slow down if that's what you want to do.But there's one thing that we wish we first knew...We saw signs there that said there were mosquitos with West Nile Virus that were discovered there.So be careful to wear repellant so your trip isn't a nightmare!-By Hailes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hailes
50,Family friendly Gardens,"I have lived in Arcadia most of my life. I find the Arboretum is very different from other gardens because of our climate, architecture, garden layout, and choice of plants and waterfowl. The Arboretum is presently arranged uniquely suited for use as a location for such hits as Tarzan, Fantasy Island, and other television productions. The buildings were built in the late nineteenth century.The buildings consist of Queen Anne Cottage, large stables, railroad station, telegraph office,and adobe brick ranch buildings. The grounds consist of many acres of different mediterrean plants and trees accessible by foot and some by tram. There is a large number of peacocks. There is a small lake which you can walk around and feed the ducks. It is a great place to take small children. There is a nice gift shop and eating facilities. It is located near many hotels, restaurants, and a shopping mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal19362
20,The Arboretum,"If your looking for a way to spend a sunny Southern California day, try the L.A. County Arboretum. Located in the middle of a changing city, and across the street from the Santa Anita Racetrack, this ""County Park"" sits just as it has done for so many years. Just enough wide open space to allow a nice big deep breath. I ran around the Arboretum as a kid yet I still find ""goodies"" I had never noticed. For a thrilling view, even for a ""native"", wander up underneath the native oak trees and enjoy the view of the San Gabriel Mountains from atop this knoll.I hope that all who visit the Arboretum enjoy it as much as I have and help to preserve it for generations to come. They call it a Botanic Garden now, but for anyone who grew up with this park it will ALWAYS just be ""THE ARBORETUM""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer17430
10,Lack luster botanic park,"My passion for gardens has led me to vacation in cities with well known gardens. I was suprised and disappointed with my trip to the famous Los Angeles Arboretum. The plant collections are common and look neglected. I did not see any creative or progressive plant displays. With a climate like L.A.'s mild weather, I expected to enjoy rare palnts and lots of color.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary22001
