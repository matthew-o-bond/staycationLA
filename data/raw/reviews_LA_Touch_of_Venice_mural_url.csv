40,Impressive Mural is a Venice Time Machine,This is a lovely mural. It's huge. A work of art for sure. It's not worth making a trip to Venice just to see it but it is worth reflecting upon if you are there. The thing I love about it is that it shows Venice's arched building facades from years past that are all but gone. You get a sense of Venice's rich history that only enhances its uniqueness today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGaucho1987
50,Inspired by Orson Welles's 1958 classic Touch of Evil,"It’s a marvellous art work in black and white.Inspired by the 1958 classic film-noir by Orson Welles, it shows Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, the stars of the film, walking along Windward Ave. This area of Venice was the location for a Mexican border town in the opening film sequence.The immense mural was completed by artist Jonas Never in 2012.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,The best mural in Venice,There aren’t as many as you’d think and this doesn’t fit the expected theme but the quality and detail is high. Next to the Venice lights sign but you can’t really see then both at the same time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
