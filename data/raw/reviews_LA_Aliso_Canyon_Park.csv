40,Includes the Grand Canyon of the San Fernando Valley,Nice park with plenty of shade. The north end is about 1.5 miles from the entrance and I call the northern area the Grand Canyon of the San Fernando Valley. Note how Sesnon Boulevard does not cross the park; that is because it would require a very large bridge to get across the canyon. Most of the park is nearly flat but there are two trails going up each of the sides of the canyon. The park has been recently improved with a parking area and other features.,Sam Hobbs
40,Nice place ot walk and have a picnic,"A short walk and easy. Park is well maintained and you can have a family picnic. It has ample of parking spaces. If you pick the trail on the left side, you will walk thru a nice shady oak trees. It is a round trip trail but you can loop to other trail and come back to make it a bit longer.",Jim S
