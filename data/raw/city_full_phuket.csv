50,“A must see!”,When I was here last November it was raining cats and dogs.Pick your day as I did this time and you will get some amazing views.I took many great photos from here.It starts with a walk through a museum where you can take in the old world charm and then if you like you can get blessed by one of The Monks.I experienced this as did many other foreigners. A continual chant as you wonder around helps with the ambience of the visit.
50,“INDIE Bric a Brac accessories for unisex”,"Indie Bric a Brac and accessories shop, is like a breath of fresh air, located at 45/8 Soi Sukee, Ao Chalong, Phuket, They sell an array of things but I was looking at the cotton shirts which are ideal for the Phuket climate in the tropics, they also sell oversize clothes which are very hard to find anywhere in Thailand. it's a unisex shop so should be able to find what you want.The shop is owned by Jui who speaks fluent English and you will have no trouble communicating with her, if you don't see what you want ask her, she is always willing to oblige,"
20,“If I Knew Then What I Know Now”,"My boyfriend and I decided to live in Phuket for 3 months. Luckily, we work from a laptop and can be anywhere. It's our first visit to Thailand. We chose Thailand for its warm, tropical weather, beaches and as an inexpensive place to live where our dollar would go far.We decided to stay 1 week in Patong to figure where we wanted to settle. After driving around the island with a guide, we chose Kamala. It's a much quieter town just north of Patong.Let me first say what we loved about Phuket:We love not driving a car and taking our scooter for drives.We love that its not cold. Ever.More importantly, we love the local people. They are so friendly and helpful.We love getting a 1 hr massage for $10.00USWe LOVE the food and can have 2 Thai dinners with 1 bottle of water for $4.50.We love driving the scooter to Jungceloyn to go the movies every Wednesday to a fabulous theatre to see the new releases for $3.40pp!We love walking Kamala beach at dusk to watch the sun set.Here are some things we did NOT know before arriving:Lodging - cost us more than expected. We had difficulty during high season finding a 1 bedroom condo or apartment to rent. We finally found a 2 bedroom, modern condo 6 min from the beach with a small kitchen for $1000 US a month. This was over our budget of what we expected of $600 per month.Beaches- From pictures, we expected to find clear blue/green waters and pristine beaches. In Patong and Kamala, we found overcrowding of rows and rows of beach chairs and quite a bit of trash on the beaches. You won't be able to see your feet while in the water. We took a day trip to Phang Nha Bay where the water was more beautiful. Our guide explained to us the increased boat traffic and tourists have changed the beaches here.Fellow Tourists- This is a delicate area. As I don't want to seem prejudice, we were surprised at the amount of Russian tourists who visit Phuket. The local newspaper stated they are the number 2 tourist who visit after the Chinese. The local newspaper went on daily about problems between them and the locals, and our guide in Bangkok stated there are problems in Phuket with the Russian mafia. We came in contact with them as we they cut in line ahead of you at the grocery, airport and hotels. As a whole, they made our vacation less enjoyable due to their lack of friendliness, respect and sometimes outright rudeness.Cost- if you decide to have a non-Thai meal, you will pay close to US prices. If you buy non Thai food at the grocery store, you will be paying at least double you would back in your country due to the import taxes imposed. Same goes for wine and liquor.Personal grooming- While I was happy to find a few places to perform a ""Shellac"" OPI polish, I was shocked they all charge $34 US and for a Brazilian wax, $25-$30. If a 1 hour massage is $10,why so much for nails and waxing? Because only tourists have these done, not locals.Overbuilding- The island is awash in construction of new hotels and condos everywhere. With very limited roads and NO car parking, we see this beautiful island being overdeveloped very quickly.We also visited Chiang Mai and Bangkok. We preferred Chiang Mai to Phuket because of its cheaper prices, bigger variety of restaurants, including a few American restaurants (after 3 months, comfort food from your country would be a nice change). We did not see a big influx of Russians in Chiang Mai and enjoyed our stay there."
20,“Over crowded Phuket”,"I made my first trip to Phuket in the mid 70's and have returned many times since, the latest around 7 years ago. Needless to say there have been huge changes over the years and I expected to see a lot more people there during our Feb 2013 visit. However, nothing could have prepared me for the hordes of people crowding the island, the beaches and the day tours to outlying islands. A crush of new tourists are arriving, many from China and Russia, and often on non stop, wide bodied flights. This is on top of an already large number of tourists visiting from other countries and from within Thailand itself, and my perception is that the sheer number of bodies is overwhelming the place.Fortunately we had a nice resort away from the crowds so the visit was not a total loss. If you love wall to wall people, go to Phuket, but if not, I suggest you look for some less crowded places in the region."
50,“Driving in Phuket”,"Phuket is best viewed through the car window. On our visit to Phuket in July 2012 we rented a Honda Civic 1.5L Automatic for our 5 day stay. The experience was better then our expectations. The driving in Phuket is real treat for drivers who love winding roads through the lush green mountains and sandy beaches. The traffic is usually very sane and everyone seems really cautious for some reason. But driving without a GPS will be frustrating i gather. Scooters usually r driven with their head lights on so can be spotted from far away. Phuket is not a very huge place so getting from point-A to Point-B is usually 30 mins max from one end of island to other. Routes r mostly well marked in English. and there are mainly three main routes in the Island that r mostly used to get anywhere. Route 402 should be the preferred way to anywhere as it has adequate number of convenience stores and gas stations. And you can go anywhere on the Island from this route only. The other routes r more sceanic as they go through the mountain range or less popular beaches.Finally, for anyone planning a visit to Phuket Island, i'd receommend hiring a reliable car and commute on that only. Its the best thing to do to experience the real beauty of the Island."
50,“phuket scooter hire”,"hi to all members well just got back from phuket and while i was there i hired a scooter , I had no problems with this as i took all the safe gaurds first of all you need to have an international diving permit from the post office for 5 pounds .

50,“Phuket - Loved it!”,"Family of 5 went to Phuket over Easter & stayed at the Outrigger Bang tao. (see separate review)This was the first time we had been to an Asian country so it was going to be an interesting experience. Admittedly we were not doing a truly Thai cultural vacation but more a go & see what happens. The only thing I booked in advance was the Simba sea trips tour to Phi Phi islands due to its popularity & great reviews.Once we collected our luggage & walked through arrivals at Phuket airport, I noticed the shock register on my family's face as we were solicited to by a number of tours, transport & hotel sales people. It was noisy & loud & different.They all looked at me like where have the hell you brought us to? In summary here are some points to considerWe hired a car - Driving in Phuket is manic, signs everywhere, people everywhere, power lines, utes full of people, dogs & no real adherence to road rules. Just chaos everywhere but somehow it works. The roads are good & well signed, however it takes getting used to & I am surprised there was no real road rage.Patong - Great place for day shopping & a must see, however it is reeks of seediness, sad & lonely old men, young Thai women in bars & a place for the desperate. As i have kids I am glad we didn't stay there, however if it was just me & hubby a night or two would of been a hoot! Great place to visit but too noisy to stay. Great for backpackers, couples, party goers & the desperate.Phi Phi Islands - Did a day trip, however if you can stay a couple of nights & get a longboat to take you around, it is truly beautiful & a world away. Just pristine!Elephant Trekking - Get off the island & go into Kho Saok national park where you can combine an elephant Trek & canoeing experience in one day. Great value & a full day. There are plenty of elephant rides on Phuket, do your homework.Overall what started off as shock ended up growing on me & I fell in love, with the simplicity of how people live & the people themselves. You could not meet a more accommodating race, that give you a smile with everything they do. Try to learn a little basic Thai & use it, watch there faces light up when you have a go. Ask the people questions about there lives.They love kids & they go to such lengths to please. We got lost trying to find Phuket Zoo so I knocked on someones door & asked directions. I didn't understand Thai & he didn't understand English but we were both smiling & somehow we communicated & we found the zoo with his directions. It is cheap to eat, shop & basically a great affordable family holiday. It was hot, some places smelled, there was poverty combined with a sense that it is trying to become modern. It is pretty & tropical & in a sense you feel isolated, but it leaves a lasting impression & touches you as you realize how simple people live & they smile & yet we have everything and dare complain. I have a new respect for Thai people & how hard they work. I will go back again one day but explore more."
50,“One of the Best Night life in Thailand”,"Phuket provides one of the best nightlifes. It has the sun, the beach and partying hand in hand. Phuket's reputation as a partying hotspot is well deserved with an international crowd of revelers . It has ample number of Go Go Bars, ladyboys cabaret shows, discos and clubs, live bands and jazz features.It Patong beach is always crowded. Like all night owls, Patong's liveliest party zone becomes closed to traffic and ready for action in night! Famous for its raunchy nightlife, Bangla goes all out to entertain with girls, beers and music that increases in volume as the moon rises. Jammed most nights year round, it's actually totally unthreatening and lively place to walk around as bars compete for customers."
50,"“10 Years on and we return to Phuket,why did we wait so long”","We have just returned from our trip to Phuket after nearly 10 years away,trust me it is more beautiful than I remember.I am a bit of a Bali addict,but by the end of this trip I may just have a new favourite destination.We found the island very easy to get around,you have to hire a bike,so easy and if you get pulled over by the police just show your Aussie license and they send you on your way,no bribery required.The island is very clean and traffic not as manic as Bali,food awesome and night life great...Do yourself a favour and visit gorgeous Phuket.."

40,“Great Place for long holiday”,I have never been to Phuket Thailand. So I have no expection of the town or the people. BUT I must say it turn out ok and the trip was excellent.
10,“Blue Canyon Lakes golf course”,"Went to play golf at the Blue Canyon golf couse, lakes course. it is rated amongst the top courses in Phuket. played at the end of April 2011. the course was in terrible condition. we had booked a tee off time but on arrival had to wait for over 10 minutes to be finally escorted to the golf carts. the refreshments huts did not have cold towels, staff were not friendly and did not care. very disappointed considering it is not a cheap course to play."
30,“Great place to relax”,"I stayed in Phuket for 3 days.My hotel is close to the Patong beach. so many bars open at night.Singing,dancing,having a drink.No matter who you are,no matter where you come from.Everybody here just wants to have fun."
50,“Phuket is my world”,"Wow what should i say beside this. This is my 3rd time in this lovely country as always Thai people are so nice but except some local people that always try to take advantage from you. The beaches are nice, night life is cool, food is great."
50,"“Phuket, Thailand is full of adventure and romance.”","My now fiance and I decided to visit Phuket as our dream destination in November 2010. We initially decided on Thailand because we are avid divers. Phuket seemed the logical choice because of its proximity to the dive sites. We were not disappointed, the diving was breathtaking. We saw a leopard shark, and a rare peacock shrimp amongst a variety of tropical fishes. We enjoyed the snorkeling tours just as much, if not more. Our tour to Raja Island, organised through our hotel was spectacular. As we waded into the ocean we were bombarded with tropical fish from every direction, only 2m off shore. Patong Beach itself is very vibey and busy. Please do not be mislead into thinking this particular beach offers tranquility and seculsion. The whole Patong area is centered around tourism, i would even go so far as to say it loses its culture in an effort to cater to tourists needs. The hawkers will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth, as they make you feel like a walking sales target, but the best advice i can give is to ignore, and keep your head down. Everything is fairly far apart on Phuket Island and the taxis can be expensive - depending on your exchange rate, so plan your trip carefully, to minimise travel. If you enjoy culture, the Wat Chalong Temple is really beautiful. It's worth the visit if you can afford the taxi fare. Please be aware on your travels in Thailand that their treatment of animals can be a bit shocking. Avoid pictures with animals, watching shows containing animals and zoos etc. If you want to remain a responsible tourist this is the best advice i can give. The nightlife is fascinating, especially on Bang La road, Patong. its worth a look, just for a fun time. The artwork is amazing there so if you're interested, save some money and buy some exquisite pieces that will be admired by your friends back home. They will roll them up and package them neatly for you to return home with, hassle - free. Eat only Thai food as it will save you if you're on a budget. Try the sushi, it is very cheap and don't forget to get at least one Thai massage, you won't regret it. Stay away from large shopping malls, it's more pricey and offers nothing more than you can get back at home. Visit the Big Buddah on the hill, it has spectacular views and is fascinating in itself. We did a tour that let us drive our own quad bikes up to it, which was great fun. Watch out for people offering unsolicited advice, it usually involves a sales pitch or will be totally disingenuous. Bargain, bargain, bargain. It can be totally liberating. I was worried about insulting the locals but it is actually expected and welcomed. Other tours we did included one to James Bond Island and a canoe trip through the caves of the islands off Phuket. it was both fascinating and full of adventure. I would recommend these tours for anyone who needs a break from just relaxing on the beach. Be careful who your choose as your tour operators though. There are plenty of scamsters trying to make a quick buck. Contact your hotel, or find a brochure distributor. Pick the brochures that look the most professional, its your best bet. All in all we loved every second of Phuket. It will always be with us, as it is the place we got engaged. Everything about the place is exotic and enchanting. Go to Phuket if you want romance, adventure and relaxation all mixed into one."
10,“BEWARE AIRPORT SECURITY IN PHUKET!”,"Beware Airport Security.....After checking my bags to go home to Australia, i was outside in the designated smoking area Enjoying a cigarette with my wife before our flight.A male person in a uniform with a badge and a gun (Thought it was a cop) asked us to follow him in a stern voice, i asked what the problem was and again he asked me to follow him and demanded to see my passport, no knowing what was going on i gave him my passport.He took us to a deserted part of the airport and tried to get us to get into a lift with him, i declined the offer and again asked what the problem was, he pointed to a no smoking sign and said you pay 2000baht, i tried to explain we where heading home and did not have 2000 baht, he again said you pay 2000 baht or go to jail, at this point my wife broke down and became very emotional.I showed him my wallet and that i only had 1000 baht, he snatched this and went to walk off, i called him back and asked for a receipt, he told me to wait he would go get one, he never came back.I spoke to girls at the Coral lounge and told them what happened, they agreed it wasn't right and something was very wrong, they took us to the main security area down stairs and low and behold there he was (A security Guard) they confronted him and he denied getting money off us, i called him a liar and then tended to my wife who was now more upset.An english speaking tourist guide came over out of concern and asked what was wrong, i explained everything to her and she also confronted the guard, he again denied everything, by this time i have had enough, i asked for the police and a member of the Australian Embassy to help me out, all of a sudden our money appeared out of the guards pocket, i took the money back and he walked off to his work mates, the whole time pointing and laughing at my emotional wife, we where taken back upstairs and looked after by the Coral Lounge and the tourist guide.My advice, if you are confronted by someone you think is a cop at the Phuket international airport ask for his superior and do not go with him, the Security over there are rude and arrogant and as i have recently found out have absolutely no power the guard that tried to rip us off should not even be carrying a gun according to Thai Embassy."

If you call Taxi Boss in Khao Lak 085-7861378/086-2766479 or email cheaper_khaolak@ymail.com. He will pick you up for Baht 1000 in a AC car.
50,“Great Phuket Sailing Experience!”,"I recently came back from a vacation in Phuket and was told by a friend to book a private overnight sailing trip through Jabudays.com for five of my friends that I was vacationing with. This has to be among the best travel advice I received because I had a great experience! We boarded the yacht on a Wednesday afternoon and sailed to Phi Phi island that evening. We got to watch the sunset that evening with a bottle of champagne and the chef cooked an incredible dinner (the best food I have eaten in Thailand during the entire trip!) on board. We arrived at Phi Phi that night and walked around the island and went to some bars, and boarded the ship again that night. We slept on the top of the boat so we could watch the stars (which was, in itself, amazing experience) and then the next morning, we woke up to breakfast and set sail to Maya Bay where we did some fantastic private snorkeling (before all of the other tourist boats arrived and the water was saturated with snorkelers). We then sailed to Koh Khai island and had lunch on board before we headed to the beach on that island and then we sailed back to Phuket on Thursday evening. All in all, I would highly recommend this trip to any tourists that would like a very personalized experience through the islands of Phuket. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the trip and we really couldn't have asked for anything more from the experience!"
10,“Skip Phuket and the hype!”,"Totally not worth spending even one night here unless you're staying at a Surin Beach resort...it's like the Tijuana of Thailand. Would never go back...go straight to Koh Phi Phi, Samui or other beaches instead. The only good thing was day excursion to James Bond island and limestone formations."
40,“Family holidays in Phuket Dec 2010 - Jan 2011”,"Finally on our way to Thailand via Thai airways, family of 5, 2 teenager boys and a 7 y.o girl.Thai airways delivers good service, plenty of entertainment, food and drinks for the kids, not much room but this is economy class...We stayed at the Merlin Beach Resort, 7 minutes away from the mayhem of Patong beach, after an initial mishap with our booking the staff provided us with two rooms in the 4th floor with pool views, no complaints as we expected this from a 4 star hotel.The services and facilities at this hotel are fantastic, friendly staff, excellent breakfast buffet and various restaurants to cater for everyones taste, Thai, Italian and International..., we tried the Thai and was good but the meals were too small, and a bit expensive for Thailand Standards...We managed to go and eat in Patong at the ""Tiger"" restaurant, flashy, noisy but the fact that there are plenty of western people gives you an idea of the menu... There is pizza, pasta, steaks, burgers, thai fare, salads, drinks, live music, extra friendly staff.. the food was good and cheap.We were busy with the tours, as recommended by this blog, we took the Phuket sail tour with Captain Mark, a fantastic experience, very friendly and custom made for small groups, the food was excellent, plenty of hidden beaches, swimming spots far away from the crowds.. Highly recommended.The second tour that we took was the Simba tours as well highly recommended by this site, unless you love, and i mean LOVE snorkelling please do take this tour...there were plenty of time spent snorkelling and encouraging people to learn and try which is ok. Friendly staff, nice picnic at one deserted beach but still cannot understand the fact that there was only aussie fare on the menu...Phi Phi Islands are amazing, the monkey island a lot of fun but probably can make the stay a bit longer.To get around Phuket you must get a taxi tour if you are a first timer or hire a car if you have been there before, the traffic is madness at peak hour and you need a sixth sense to drive...Before you attempt to do any shopping at Patong go to Phuket town markets, get an idea of the prices and bargain everything, they will try to charge you almost twice the price for everything so do your homework..Phuket is cheap but if everyone is paying half the price the joke is on you...Being at the ""Merlin Beach resort"" you can enjoy good traditional thai food a cheap prices...there is this restaurant, small hut on the left side of the beach at the end of long stairs uphill..its called Little Tiger, the view is excellent, the staff don't say much but the food is good.There is a massage hut on the right side of the beach, they can do the hair braiding for the girls and the henna tattoo for the boys at good prices, and the most important part, they will do your laundry for one third of the price of the hotel rates, the big boss can organise the taxi tour and the places to visit with one of his family members, usually 1500 baht for 5 to 6 hours around Phuket. We did go kart racing, shooting, elephant trekking, Kata beach, Karon beach, Big Budha, Chalong Temple, lunch at Chalong bay (expensive but good), Phuket town markets...Phuket is nice, noisy, dirty, chaotic, friendly, cheap, sleazy, hot, humid, good food... with excellent islands and beaches...A placed full of Happy Aussies and Russians, young and very old with only one thing in common.. a Thai girl wrapped around them..One big complaint to the Hotel, the New Years eve gala dinner celebration with show... $200 Au each, only..it was terrible, the show was boring, and the buffet awful... one third of the guests left before 10pm and came back just for the nice fireworks at 12..Last year we spent it at the Sheraton in Fiji and it was way better that this....!If i go back to Phuket...Probably will go to Kata beach next time with the family..."
40,“Patong Beach”,"Great place to experience, people are polite and considerate to foriegn visitors to thier Kingdom. Water is beautiful and temperature of water for swimming is 72F-76F.Every kind of accomodation you would expect in a exotic location . There is even a Starbucks on the Beach Road, go figure.Definitely a absolute must for scuba divers, Phi Phi Islands or Similan Islands or several other choices of Islands within the Andaman Sea. You can do a day trip or several days w/ stayover on the dive boat. Whatever you choose be prepared to have an experience of a lifetime. Renowned throughout the world as one of the premier dive destinations in the world. Marine life abundant with briliant color and shapes of the fish and the soft coral and sea anemonies.Fantastic Location!"
50,“Great Place for Party!”,"Thailand is wonderful country. If you were planning on going for holiday in Summer Season you must go to PHUKET, is fantastic. There is so much to do and see all over the Island, you will not have enough time to see it all in one trip. The beaches were all clean and the hotels were wonderful. Food presentation like tip night on a cruise ship, all the time, no matter where you are. Hotel for all budget, I stayed in Floral, great situation and % starts hotel at 3 starts price. Phuket is a paradise for people who likes parties but also if you want to relax. Things are ""a must"" to do: get massages, shop around and visit typical restaurants. My pick #1 Seahag Restaurant in the heart of Patong Beach!"
40,“A Relaxing 4 nights Stay”,"My family of 3 recently went to Phuket for a break. Everything was smooth going as we did some research on forums prior to travel. After clearnce at the airport, we immediately turned right at the exit and headed straight on to the TAXI counter (can't miss it -a bright YELLOW sign) and told them our destination hotel near the Patong beach. The fare was a straight THB 450. There are of course cheaper options but you may need to detour somewhat rather than arriving direct to your destination. We were booked at Mercure hotel which was very conveniently located. Its just a 5-6 mins walk to the beach area and there are many restaurants and cafes around with reasonably cheap eats on the menu (average around THB300-400 for a dinner for 3). The hotel has a reasonably impressive outdoor pool and my 8 year old enjoyed it tremendously. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The weather was good with some sunshine but the last 2 days were wetter with showers. The thing to watch out for -at Jungceylon Shopping Centre which is about 25 mins walk from our hotel -the stuffs for sale were not exactly cheap nor fanciful. There is Carrefour with limited items and Robinsons as well. Worst to watch for is the food offered at the 'hawker centre' in the basement. If the local spices are not agreeable with your system, please do not try it. The risk is a sure upset stomach and you will need your Norit -carbon!!Along the beach front, all kinds of touristy shops with the usual tourist stuff are offered. To stay safe, you can opt for MacDonalds, Burger King, pizzas or some hotel fare from the beach-front hotels with impressive sea food on menus. For relaxation, there are loads of beach chairs with the usual para-sailing, high speed boat rides, scootering and such sports.Our taxi driver gave us a name card and we stayed with her for the return trip to the airport. All in, it was a pleasant break away from the stress of modern Singapore."
10,“Thai Airways International RelationsManager”,"After complaining to Thai Airways, I got this reply from their International Relations Manager:Dear Khun Kriangsak Kanjanapas,We would like to refer to your flight on TG638 from Phuket to Hong Kong on November 18, 2010.We are very sorry to learn from our Manager at Hong Kong Airport that you experienced difficulties upon checking in for the flight at Phuket Airport on this occasion.

50,"“Phuket, great place, good people.”","We flew into Phuket and stayed at the Kata Beach Resort and Spa, which is a great place to stay, thoroughly recommend it. We visited Kata, karon, old Phuket town, Patong and many other smaller places along the way. We visited late September, early October for 14 nights, the sea was swimable and the beach at Kata clean and tidy. It only rained for about 4 days, so not too bad.We were holidaying with children so can't comment on the nightlife. We found the bargaining for our purchases fun and not at all tedious, always do it with fun, the Thai people have a good sense of humour. If you don't want to be bothered by the shop workers/tailors asking you in to have a look or get a suit made, which they do ALL THE TIME, then this is not the place for you.The Big Budha is certainly worth a visit. We hired Manop Putapaya (see his website ""show me phuket"") to collect us from the airport and also to do a day trip around a number of places. He was recommended on Trip Advisor and was prompt, friendly and full of interesting knowledge. We would certainly recommend him.Dino's mini golf in Karon was a must do if you have kids, go at night, the kids will love it. We had dinner there also.We got tuk tuks everywhere and all the drivers were friendly. Great place, for a relaxing holiday with a good dose of culture."

40,“My trip tp Phuket”,"I was in Phuket last March,2010.I stayed at Avantika hotel which was is a nice ,small boutique hotel,at Patong Beach.It is a very good hotel ,a little far away from main attractions and shopping which can be good or bad : good if you want privacy and quietness ,bad if you don't want to walk for 20 minutes to night life area and shopping.The beach was very good,and sunny all the time .Shopping : all are around Bangla Road ,many shops ,cheap prices but you have to excercise your bargaining skills.Some sellers are too pushy .Tuk Tuk : some drivers are very rude and are not willing to negotiate rates.It seems they all have - more or less - fixed rates,which is a minimum of 100 bht even for a close distance of a hundred meters.Restaurants : many fast food chains like Mckdonald's,pizza hut...etc. Also some Italian restaurants.Some buffet restaurants.Starbuck's and other cafes .Prices are good between 130-250 bht per meal,plus drinks.Buffet =450-500 bht,plus drinks.I liked some Thai dishes.Night life : mainly around Bangla road : many bars,girlie bars and few discos .Can be noisy and crowded ( for me sleasy )Other :For location and convenience ,Patong Beach Hotel ,which is next to Holiday Inn,both are facing the beach and close to shopping area.Holiday Inn is like an oasis of 3 large swimming pools."

We got a driver from our Hotel (Patong Merlin Resort) which is a great hotel.. Mr Tom (0899089183) he was a great guy who will take you anywhere you want at a very very good price he is a single dad bringing up his 14 year old son and doing a very good job at that too. Tom took us to Silver Rado which is every womans dream shop if they love Pandora and the real stuff it is, I got a bracelet for my daughter which was 1171 baht ($41.00 aus) and 5 beads which start from $19.00 aus to $25.00 aus they have just started importing them to Melbourne it is a must , a friend of mine bought a whole braclet for $300.00 aus. We went horse riding for 2 hours with the Phuket Riding Club it was great 1500baht we went up through the jungle and then along Chalong beaches we had a guide lead the horse which was good for me as I havent ridden a horse much. Had a doctor Fish Spa what a treat it was like I had pins and needles in my feet while the fish where nibbling at my dead skin, 99baht at Junceylon Department StoreHad some really nice meals as always to many places to mention."
50,“One of the most thrilling trips life can experience!!!”,"""Once in a life time"", that's what my mother told me before I took a trip to Thailand. I never saw it coming when my mom told me to start packing our bags because we were leaving for Phuket, Thailand. We didn't have any ideas where to stay, what to do and where to visit. All we knew was... ""We were heading there!!!"" yep, that's how my life was and sometimes still is.We got there it was amazingly HOT... but I thought we were going to have problems traveling and finding a place to stay, NOT AT ALL! The first thing I learnt was Thai people were so kind. We took this Tuk-Tuk ride and the driver was helping us looking for a nice place to stay with such a low budget. Of course, we didn't plan ahead!We ended up staying right next to the beach and the hotel was very antique. The beach was nice and I can still remember how the sand underneath my feet was so warm, unlike here!Next day we bought a trip to phang-gna but what amazed me was the actual program we had. SEA CANOEING! Took some photos and would love to share them... Thrilling and worthwhile.All the food were great, though too spicy sometimes, for me. I love Thai people. I love their language. I love the Tuk-Tuk rides. With all of this, I have to thank my mom for using <a href=""http://www.cheapairlines.com/"">cheap airline tickets</a> that we had enough budget to fly all the way to Thailand and also had enough to come back home!! I sometimes think to myself, I'd rather now not have enough budget then...to come home!Yall really need to experience it, like what my mother said!!! ""Once in your life time"""
50,“wonderful country”,"Thailand is wonderful country. If you were planning on going for holiday from Apr. 29th to May. 2nd put your fears aside. Phuket is fantastic. There is so much to do and see all over the Island, you will not have enough time to see it all in one trip. The beaches were all clean and the hotels were wonderful. Come and enjoying it."
50,“great holiday in the low season”,"First trip to Phuket and will definitely not be the last.It was the low season - end July, and we enjoyed not having the teeming visitors that are attracted by this island. We had rain almost each day, but as it was always over 25C and short duration showers, did not hamper our visit.Great shopping - 4 of us travelling got a total of 6 suits , plus a ''mother of the bride' dress - our friend took a magazine cutting to show the design and it came out perfectly. HIghly recommend the tailor - Henry's collections (main Patong beach). Crocodile leather handbags were a 1/4 of price in Australia so splurged on one.Went to see the James Bond island (Phang Nga Bay). Luckily it was a beautiful sunny day with no rain!! enjoyed the trip in a long boat to the island, went canoeing around an island getting a close look at the eroding limestone and lunch at a village built over the water. There are numerous travel outlets across Phuket that will provide a wide range of excursions to suit your plans.Ate on the beach most days, at night they bring out tables right onto the beach - fun eating with sand in between your toes.We were not into the nightlife so cannot comment on this aspect of Phuket. All in all, a relaxing place to visit , great value location for the tourist dollar."
40,“expensive beach holiday”,"we had been in phuket,thailand for 3 days with family .it is an excellent beach destination but very expensive.sea food is very good.one day powerboat cruise to phi-phi & bamboo island is a must. hi point is snorklling in shallow water even if you dont know how to swim.vegetarian food is sightly difficult to obtain ."
20,“Phuket for mass tourism – Ko Samui for more exclusive stays”,"First time on the island, but have been to Thailand many times, Phuket is all but typical. Yes, it’s still Thailand, but with too many tourists and being too commercial. On Phuket, tourists will find all sorts of pleasures associate with this country (good food, nice beaches, massages, and even more). In low season, the places seems to be great, but don’t go there when it’s packed. We went to Katong Beach at the island’s south-western end, which was nice and much better than over-crowded and “rip-off” Patong. If possible, try to get as close as possible to a private/separated beach portion and take a taxi if you feel like partying. Renting a car is also easy, but not worth it. Alternative is renting a motorbike."
30,“What they don't tell you about day excursions”,"I travelled with my wife to Phuket at the end of June for two weeks. It turned out that this is the low season due to monsoon type weather which we experienced for our first week, however it was very hot and humid otherwise. We chose to stay at Cape Panwa Hotel (review in its own section) on the south coast, which is a quiet resort and away from the hustle and bustle of Patong.With regards to excursions, in my opinion they were not worth while:Fantasea was a complete let down. I had been excited to go after hearing people had returned three times to the island just to see this show, however, during our performance, many people left early, and of those that stayed at least half appeared disappointed. The show had some dance, a story that was so simple and yet not interesting to follow, some magic from the nineties, and the worst part of it for me was seeing elephants perform. The latter made my gut wrench, to think that these beautiful mammals were being made to perform for our entertainment. I also witnessed a young Tiger Cub being forced to have pictures taken with tourists prior to the show by what appeared to be making it starve all day so that it could be made to comply by giving it many bottles of milk. See this at your own risk.We booked with Island Safaris for the white water rafting experience, but all companies used the same section of river just north of Phuket so one would be the same as the other. This was absolutely atrocious! This is not a naturally occuring rapid. It is made so by the release of water in a dam twice a day. Therefore everyone has to be on a raft at a set time to enjoy the raised water level - there were between 30-50 rafts each carrying 6 people. I can only explain this from my experience, but being one of the last rafts as a result of queing in places to allow rafts to go in single file, there was not enough water to form a rapid let alone a trickle. Consequently, the raft kept hitting rocks and getting stuck on them. The poor guides (two of them for every four people on a raft) worked so hard, in the end they seemed too exhausted to do any further work in getting the raft moving. A trip that should have take two hours lasted four hours! During this we had to bounce up and down on the raft to get it moving, and on three occassions we had to all get out of the raft and walk through the river along the side on dangerous slippery rocks. On the third occassion I slipped and caught my ankle between two rocks. Being a doctor myself, I could see that this could have easily resulted in a fractured fibula or ankle, luckily it was just severe brusing and skin lacerations with a sprain, leaving me unable to walk for a couple of days. I was so angry that the company were just taking money and putting people at risk of harm like this. When we finally returned to base I complained because of the ordeal we were subjected to, the injuries I sustained, and because we had wasted the marjority of the day which meant we would be missing out on the remaining activities (elephant riding and several shows). No one on the staff were interested. The company shrugged us off, would not give us a refund, and basically told us if we did not get on the bus they would leave us there (two hours drive from our start point). We should have known that it was a bad company when we were picked up from our hotel and driven in a run down safari jeep which was in very poor condition. To make matters worse when we were transported home the driver disregarded our safety completely and went through two red lights, one of which he had to swerve to avoid hitting a car that had stopped for the red light. If you still want to do white water rafting do it somewhere like New Zealand which I can recommend, otherwise do not do it with Island Safaris, they only want your money!The day trip to Phang Na Islands was lovely and worth while. The companies all chose to cram their speedboats with customers, to the point where there are not enough seats for everyone which can be disappointing for long distances. The islands that you stop on can also be crowded and loose their sense of awe and beauty. The food served on this trip is not good quality! But generally this is a much better trip than going to Phi Phi, and you do canoeing through caves which was the highlight of the day. However there are no good spots for snorkelling, unlike the Phi Phi trip where they take you to a bay surrounded by cliffs and off a shore where there is relatively good snorkelling to be done.If you are going to book, be careful. The tourist agents will try and charge high prices. In our case it turned out that we ended up paying the tour agent as much as we paid the companies who held the trips. 1000bht per person should be what the company gets, so around 2000bht is the mimimum you should pay, with an average of 3000bht being reasonable for a couple going on a day excursion. I would not recommend the tour agent next to Sawasdee, he was very rude and in my opinion he was very vile when I told him that I had booked elsewhere. There are agents along the hill and in Patong."
50,“Amazing trip with Richard & Megumi”,"Phuket Pro Dive & Tour Co Ltd.We visited in 2008 and met Richard & Megumi, they took us on an amazing day trip to Phi Phi Island but with a difference, Snorkling,swimming, beautiful food and fantastic company, amazing trip.So when we visited again 2-16th June 2010 we gave them a ring, Megumi came to the hotel and over a beer we asked her what trips they had this time. She literally invented one for our party of 6 and also for a father with 3 kids from South Africa who were great fun to be with on the day.We were all picked up from accom, transferred to a huge luxury trawler and off we went to Racha Noi tuna fishing as we went. All food was included, we did snorkling, fed the fish, swam in crystal clear water and then about 4.00pm we set off back to the mainland fishing once again. A total of 21 Tuna caught on the day, so Richard suggested we take them to a Gypsy village not far from the pier and for a small fee they clean & cook the tuna. Dinner was served with a few cold ones, lots of laughs.Richard & Megumi are amazing hosts, they went out of their way to show us a great day. Thanks Richard & Megumi."
50,“Phuket Graceland great stay”,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Phuket Graceland. This hotel is a fantastic position and the amenities are 5 star. We were 3-4 blocks into the town near enough to walk or as you say 150bt for a tuk-tuk. There are no problems in Phuket and the people are fantastic and really need us to travel as that is what they rely on. The weather was hot only need shorts and singlet’s we had one hour of rain that was all. We did the Elephant ride and white water rafting which was great, we booked at the back of the hotel a small place but it was much cheaper and they were fantastic with organizing pickups and delivery always on time. We also did the James Bond and Pipi Island with them, and really enjoyed both. We paid 2000 Bt for the boat trips and a little more for the elephant trip.We ate at all the places mentioned in TA and did not have one bad meal. Thank to everyone who wrote as it did help, one small thing if they stop you on a motorbike asking you if you speak English and offer you to do a 20min interview to get freebies etc DON’T DO IT for timeshare and takes up 4 hours of your time"
40,“Just came back from Phuket”,"Just came back from Phuket. Wanted to thank-you all for those who told me that everything was safe and sound. I had concerns before about going to Phuket during all the red-shirt violence but ppl were kind enough to post that everything was safe.-we opted to stay in kata rather than patong-cab ride from airport to kata will cost around 700baht...they'll tell you 800baht but you can bargin down a 100-stayed at 2 hotels...Serene resort...nice hotel with a nice pool and at Kata poolside resort....that was definitely the best bang for the buck...paid $25 US on agoda...clean, spacious rooms with a decent pool and walking distance to beach...would highly recommend that-ate at a restaurant called Orchid 3...a little out of the way in a alleyway, but definitely the best priced meals and great food-cab ride or tuk-tuk to patong from kata cost 400baht-for shopping...for men's style knock-offs of polos...Fred Perry, Lacoste, Polo...paid 2 for 400baht...some stores were charging way more than that and unwilling to bargain :(-went with my wife, so if you're looking for a nice, relaxing, quiet vaca, would definitely recommend kata rather than patong-patong is definitely the place to be if you want to party!-for those who are flying on air asia, they're a great airline...never had a problem with flights...they are stringent on weight, and we were close to the 15kg weight limit (you can pay for more) however, we found that they never checked the weight of carry-ons, so we loaded a lot of stuff in themThanks for everyone again who helped my wife and I in our decision to go to Phuket during all the violence in Bangkok...there was absolutely nothing in Phuket"
50,“Plastic Surgery”,"I visited the Phuket International Hospital in May 2010 and had my first experience of facial botox treatments. The plastic surgeon, Dr Rushapola S'dawat, took a great amount of time explaining to me the benefits and problems with facial cosmetic surgery to allow me to make a well formed decision. The treatment at this hospital was slightly higher in price than some other areas of Phuket, but I trusted and believed in Dr Rushapola S'dawat's and his advice. He has a very gentle manner and is very experienced. I ended up with botox around my mouth, crows feet, brow, forehead and other places. The cost of botox to my mouth was about A$740 (May 2010). I got a great deal for the rest of my face. The whole treatment took about 45 minutes (including 20 minutes waiting for the anaesthetic too work). There was some discomfort during the needling but bearable over the 15 minutes of actual needling. Ice compressions were immediately applied. I walked out of the hospital with slight redness in areas of my face and some needle puncture marks around my mouth but this was easily covered with face powder-2 hours later there were no signs at all. I would recommend Dr Rushapola S'dawat to anyone undergoing any form of cosmetic/plastic surgery. He does most plastic surgery procedures and will be able to offer laser liposuction in a few months (which is his specialisation). Contact him before leaving home-I'm sure he will be able to answer any queries you have. The staff at the hospital were fabulous as well. Typical of the gentle Thai people. I found him by googling lasik +phuket: there is a connection with the lasik eye surgery, next door at Phuket International Hospital."
50,"“If riots start in Bangkok, Thailand, head for Phuket, Thailand”","We were sceptical to visit Thailand when riots broke out in Bangkok. However, as we had planned this trip last August, nothing would stop these brave people for venturing out.We were traveling light as we wanted to shop in Thailand. We stayed at Millennium Resort and we did not know it has an ideal location. Just in front was Patong Street and the beach.When we landed, we started dining, shopping and in search of entertainment. Food was a disppointment. We were told to go to No. 6 which is right on main street in front of the mall. The portion was small and expensive. We came to the conclusion that food in Bangkok was better than in Phuket as they may have adjusted the cooking to the taste buds of the western tourists.The shops were managed by foreigners from Nepal, Myanmar and India. They are not as friendly as the Thais. I understand from them that the thais are now their bosses and had hired them or let out the stores for them to manage.They need to learn how to SMILE like thais.;)We took a cruise to the three islands, Khai, Maya and Phi Phi. Our suggestion is forget the first two as there were only beach chairs and expensive beverages on the first island, khai and only one miserable beach on Maya. Phi Phi island was larger and better equipped as it was a divers village. There were restaurants, shops and hotels. If you like you can stay overnight.We were eager to get back as the entire cruise was spend traveling from one island to another. When we get back we decided to watch the Simon Cabaret. I had watched it once many years ago when it was sleazy with indecent dresscode. Now, it was more capttivating as it was more of a cultural show. We enjoyed the show. Remember to give a tip when you take a photo with the entertainers and do not bargain! This tip is the basis to provide for their upkeep and surgery.;)On the street in the evening, we walk about and it was an eye opener, there were many people?????you get a better idea when you visit. There were also many sales people asking you to buy ""shows""...be forewarn!We enjoyed shopping the most. However, you need the skill to bargain. Some shopkeeper become very rude when you bargain. They are not Thais. Now, how much to bargain? suggestion is to an amount that you are comfortable to part with your USD or Euro. This is a no-stress shopping tip.:)As for Quality, we must believe we pay for what we get...:)We need to continue to support the land of the SMILE and thus, we strongly encourage people to visit Phuket. We were definietly visit again!"
50,"“Fabulous people, fabulous places in Bangkok, Phuket and Singapore.”","Visited Bangkok for 4 nights. Must do's include Royal Palace and Floating Market. Sofitel Silom Hotel was absolutely fantastic as were the staff, try and upgrade to Club as it is well worth it.Flew on to Phuket and Le Meridien Phuket Beach resort. This hotel is fantastic and the staff superb. Food in Hotel expensive but a short ride to Patong and there are many restaurants - you are spoilt for choice. Bangla road is full of action later on in the evening 11.30pm onwards - you do not have to experience any of the seedy side of Patong should you choose not to although it was an education to see the Lady boys in action.Simon's Cabaret is well worth a visit give the Zoo a miss - it really needs reporting, elephants chained tightly and a tiger that had to be nudged to bring on a roar for the 'official' photograph. We couldn't take any more and left fairly swiftly.Fabulous Peach Thai Tailor if you want that something special. All materials used are really good quality and I had silk dress shorts made up, plus a couple of evening dresses. I could have bought them for less but the quality and materials were sub standard in the past when I have visited the tailors along Patong beach front so be careful!Phuket town is very cheap and worth a visit, although there is a shop called Ocean Plaza at the top of Bangla road - some real bargains there. There is a huge shopping centrre Jung Ceylon where you can buy just about anything. Treat yourself to having your feet tickled by the 'Doctor Fish' - good fun.Flew on to Singapore via Slikair. One of the best flights ever even though it was only about 1hr 45mins.Stayed at the Marina Mandarin - spectacular views from the hotel bedroom! Again it was only a 4night trip and yes, we visited Raffles and had the obligitory singapore sling - bit too sweet for my liking but - you've just got to do it! Book the Chinatown trip which includes - trishaw ride (hilarious) chinese meal (mouth watering and so much to eat), boat trip ( see Clarkes Key come alive.) I have to say don't get excited about the china town part the market stalls are full of cheap goods and make sure you ask the price of everything before you buy - I think they make the prices up depending upon how you are dressed! Singapore is literally a mine for shopping! City links provide underground air conditioned walkways containing at least three levels of shopping. Orchard road provides designer shops galore but I'm afraid that we did more window shopping than purchasing - the sterling rate was pitifully low when we visited in April 2010.All in all a wonderful experience, lots of happy memories, and lots of new friends made."
50,"“Magnifique Tailors, Phuket”","We have just returned from a week in Phuket and I have come home with a fabulous suit, dress and shirts, all made by Magnifique Tailors.It can be overwhelming to find a terrific tailor when there is one on every corner. Of course you can get a suit made for next to nothing, but when you get home, expect it to last for a very short time.Like everything you get what you pay for, but the staff at Magnifique were so helpful with the selection process. It is important to start with a good fabric, ie Cashmere with a silk blend. Expect to go back to the tailors at least 3 times (15 minutes max), as it is imperative to get the right fit. The store is well lit, spacious, and thankfully air conditioned and a cold drink is always offered. Nothing is a problem for the friendly staff.I have no hesitation in recommending Magnifique Tailors.Enjoy your time in Phuket and the shopping experience.Christine"
20,“Not a very clean place!”,"I have just finished a 2 week holiday on the so called Pearl of the Andaman, Phuket, which is a beautiful island. My only regret is how dirty I found the place. Everywhere you travel on this island there is garbage strewn all around. Mostly at convenience stores without naming the stores. Garbage everywhere, piles of it, with small roadside restaurants preparing, cooking and serving food only a few feet away from piles of rotting garbage. I have even witnessed rats amongst the garbage, with drainage ditches running with raw sewage nearby. We took a trip on a yacht in Phang Nga, a national park. This is a national disgrace, as the water was strewn with plastic bottles, foam containers and what I can only describe as emulsified oil from ships, we did not even want to swim in it. I also understand that Phuket produces 300 tons more garbage than it can incinerate each day and has so for the past 4 years. I am also sure that it cannot deal with the amount of sewage that it produces and that most of it will end up in the sea, where we want to swim. All of this is leading up to a possible health epidemic of biblical proportions or at the very least will stop people from returning on holiday to Phuket, which is the major revenue for this now overpopulated island. Please Phuket clean up your act, people do not want to go on holiday to such an unclean place."
50,"“Scratch-Card, You have won a prize scam ***Warning***”","Phuket, Thailand is in itself a wonderful place for a holiday. My group of friends usually travels as couples and loves to stay in local Thai Hostels. We have always had a great experience. However, we had one unsavory situation that needs to be shared with Trip Adviors.This review is completely the personal experience of my personal group of friends who experienced this situation first hand.On Surin, Kata, and Karon beaches and probably the rest too, have some smiling people standing around. They will ask you, ""do you speak German, Swedish, or English?"" Then they will ask you to scratch a card. Each person in your group will scratch a card. Inevitably, one will win. The person will excitedly say there are only several cards a month that will win the prize and that if you go sit in a presentation, they will get a bonus. (We also got a sob story about how the caucasian South African young man needed rent money.) Next they will do anything (promising all the free drinks you can drink) to get you into a free car, to their office to redeem the prize. Beware, they will tell you, just sit through a 1 1/2 hour presentation (more like 4-5 hours with them trying to redirect you at any moment so you don't leave, driving you all over the western island to show you their ""great"" property), They use high pressure sales tactics and if you show any disinterest, become very intense. Please, stay away from anything offering a free prize. It is too good to be true in this world. We wasted an entire afternoon of our holiday at this presentation and left with more than a headache. I don't know whether or not this ""Holiday Club"" or timeshare company is legitimate or not. But you can google scam in thailand and ppL for yourself and see what you get. Be wise on your holiday. Enjoy Thailand."
50,“My stay in Marriot Vaccation Club Phuket”,"My Trip to phuket was Excellent, Phuket called as Pearl of Andaman is very Beautifull place. Its a very good place for Night life lovers. Not very ideal for family.There are few must see places in phuket one is Fantasea show pls choose the show with dinner, next is trip to james bond island and cannoing. Please dont miss it.Its also good for people who like watersports.My stay at Marriot Vaccation Club was unforgatable experience the 2 bed room apartments are huge and comes with private pool. The beach is clean and safe.In the hotel there was a golf buggy to take you around. The service is excellent its really worth the money."
50,“Get to the Islands offshore”,"Phuket is really a beach town that is fragile to over tourism. If you want to come and sit on a lovely beach, get nightlife(discos) etc, this is what Phuket has to offer. Ecotourism is difficult as the natural beauty is being ruined by throngs of tourists in daytrips from the hotels- arriving in speedboats by the hundreds and leaving trash and feeding the animals (very sad). Since there is no regulation of this, anyone with a boat can offer tours. you should be very cautious to be certain exactly what you are getting when you book a tour. We used John Grey seacanoe from Ao pang for three day camping in the islands. This is an extraordinary way to get to the islands before th tourists and enjoy the natual beauty and leave to a more remote area one everyone arrives. They have very high standards and even reinforce picking uptrash, being quite and never interfering with the animals. We appreciated the fragility of the ecosystem and know that if more is not done for Phuket, the mangroves will die and the monitors, birds and monkeys will be lost. That said, camping is notmfor everyone and it is quite expensive by Thai standards even with food, guides etc all included, but after all- you get what you pay for if you want a private tour- well worth it!Do however insist on a tour with John aboard, he really makes the trip interesting with his wealth of information about the ecosystems of the area and challengesAnyone who would take a speedboat into a Hong in my mind is not worth touring with! Hopefully Thailand will enact some legislature in the future and protect their beautiful beaches from certain ruin"
50,"“Culture, Food, Sight seeing and shopping”","My first trip to Phuket was fantastic , many thanks to the contributions of so many on trip advisor, special thanks to Richard (kiwilad37) , Cathy & Gary and Bob & Janette.First things first - Shopping! Having read the shopping tips I was ready and eager to bargain. I even learned some helpful questions and phrases from this site (Thailand - important phrases) such as Pang - expensive. Pang mak - very expensive and Lot noi mai dai ?- may I have a small discount? Nit noi? - little bit? Ha Ha, this lead to a very amusing encounter with a shop keeper who began to speak thai, without interuption I might add. When she finished speaking I put my hand on her shoulder and told her that I could not speak Thai, she laughed, threw her arms around me and gave me the discount.The other memorable experience was when looking for a bag, I asked if there were any more styles - and we went off to the secret room - the airconditioned secret room. I had read about these rooms so I was happy to follow. Don't be afaid to follow shop keepers to their secret rooms this is normal practice.I would suggest that shopaholics vist Cathy & Gary's travel page for prices, my head is still swimming with Baht. I would also suggest taking a wallet size list with currency conversions, start with 100bt to 1000bt , it just makes it easier to work out what you're spending. The OTOP market in Patong was where I had most success, finding it easier to get a good discount. Now you'll be thirsty after all that shopping so while you're there go and have a Chang/Singa/or other refreshing beverage with Penn at the Parrot Bar, Penn is so delightful and speaks excellent english. Tell her that Kim sent you and give her a hug for me.On Saturday & Sunday night the Phuket market is open and although the goods are much the same as those in Patong & Karon, the most interesting aspect is the food it is so colourful, most vendors had excellent presentation. Many of the locals ate there, as did the few tourists.Eating Out - Being food lovers, my husband & I keenly followed the advise from Richard's Tip Sheet visiting lots of the resaurants he reccomended. We tried the Red Onion In Karon, for a late lunch. It opens at 3pm and is a good time to get there before the crowds arrive. It was cheap and delicious - a roi ka!The Seahag in Patong was our favourite, we did have some trouble finding it so, if you stand at the end of Bangla Rd, face the beach, turn left and it's in the third street (Soi 111). The service was the best in town, spring rolls and the prawns in coconut were to die for. Airconditioned inside as well as alfresco dining, open from 11am to12pm. Price range 150bt to 300bt per person.Mom Tios in Kata is five star, the setting is sensational, overlooking Kata Noi Bay. I had downloaded the menu and booked our final meal there, unfortunately , & I should have known better, the lunch menu was not the same as the downloaded one. Although I had been salivating over the evening menu, I was not too dissapointed at our lunch time menu...take a look at the photos.While in Patong we also dined at No 6 (very very cheap) on Rat -u- Thit Rd and Thab Thim Dang No8 where my husband enjoyed Lobster and I the tiger prawns.Tours- our airport transfers were prebooked by our travel agent. The same company, Asia Destinations, Sang came to visit us to cofirm our departure details and offered a 1/2 day trip to The Big Buddha, Chalong Temple, Kata big view point, The worlds biggest jewellry store and discount factory outlet for only 300Baht. An excellent price! The drivers get a commission for taking tourists to some of these places. I must admit, I didn't think I'd walk out of the jewellery store with anything, but the Benjarong ceramics were devine.We also did the Phan Nga Bay sail tour with Phuket Sail Tours (or Captain Mark) visiting the Hongs & Caves. Numbers on board are limited, so the experience is more initmate than some of the other operators who seemed to herd their passangers on & off their vessles. Light refreshments served onboard and lunch is served on a beach (really good food). There is time for a swim and the bay is beautiful , well worth doing. We paid 6000Bt for two, about $210AUD depending on the exchange rate. Highly recommended, bookings available via internet [--]People Watching at Patong- Bangla Rd is closed to traffic at night and is truely interesting. Take a seat at on of the many bars, the Aussie bar is good. Sit down, enjoy a drink or two and watch the Lady Boys and street characters, buy a trinket or two from the street vendors and listen to the tailors touts greeting Aussie tourists ""how are ya mate.....it's cheaper than Wagga Wagga"" etc. Very entertaining.Finally Phuket is a great place to visit, its very hot and you'll come back home with a new appreciation for building codes and road rules. lol. Thai people are very friendly. A trip well worth doing.Grab a 37page Tip Sheet from Richard, take a look at Cathy and Gary's travel page as well as Bob and Janettes. Enjoy!"
10,“Avoid Phuket”,"Phuket is a dangerous island. While we were there we saw and heard reports everyday of violence towards the tourists and massive over charging. We quickly discovered that smiles in ""The Land of Smiles"" were just a mask to help extract money from tourist pockets.We a a young family with two children aged 7 and 5. The package we bought seemed very reasonable, but once we got there we could not move from the resort without having to spend a lot of money on transportation. $20 minimum for a return trip to anywhere, even a restaurant not more than 800m yards away. There are no useful bus services at all. The beach is expensive, if you can afford to get there, sunbeds at $10 each per day, and forget the jet skis and other ""fun"" things, they are way over priced and we met several people who had been made to pay hundreds of dollars for damage that they didn't cause to the jet skis.Be warned, stay closer to home, you may get a cheap package to Thailand but once you are there you will be extorted at every turn. We ended up financial prisoners in our resort. Don't make the same mistake we did, this is not paradise it's a charade, much closer to hell than heaven.You have been told, do not go to Phuket, you will regret it."
50,“An R&R location”,"I find phuket a wonderful holiday destination. Its quite yet happening place. If one needs to travel to phuket, dont miss the phi phi island tour. Its a nice place."
50,“Great place in Thailand”,"My wife and I stayed in Karon in Phuket. It was a lot of fun. It's a bit more quiet than Patong but still nice. Patong is definitely where all the action is. If we return, we would probably stay in Patong next time. We went and visited the Phi Phi Islands. The trip also included a visit to the monkey Island which was amazing. There were monkeys there that came right up to us so we can feed them bananas. The bananas were provided to us by our tour guide. It was a blast. We also saw the Fantasea show. I thought it was a bit overrated but still entertaining. It's just something to do when your there, I guess."
50,“My first Phuket trip”,"This is my first Phuket trip with all my friends. We'd like to thank JcTour-Phuket, for being so helpful, kind and good services.Since we only have 3 days and 2 nights in Phuket, we book 2 tours, PhiPhi Island + Maya Bay + Khai Island by speed boat on Jan 22nd, 2010 and the Package of James Bond + Canoeing at Phang-Nga Bay on the next morning. We pay 1700 bath/pax/tour. It's an affordable price with good service. They gave us free of charge for transfer in and out (hotel-airport-hotel) and also city tour :D on our first day arrived in Phuket. They also took a good care of our luggage and picked us up on time at the pier, so we didn't missed our flight to Bangkok at 18:40 that day.Overall I would recommed you to have Jctour-Phuket.regards,ira."
50,“Come to this Island”,"So many things you can do in Phuket. See Patong, Kata, Karon beaches and another beautiful beaches. And you can join tour to go to some closed islands around. So great and nature!"
50,“Kids favorite place in Phuket”,"Recently travelled to Phuket, Thailand with my family. My husband and I and 2 kids (8 years and 5 years old). The trip was excellent, we had so much fun, done so many different thing in the island. You can do canoeing, swimming , snorkling, sightseeing,and above all the scenery fantastic . We start the tour by going to Phi Phi island, Maya Bay and Khai island by speed boat. I've tried both the ferry and speed boat . My opinion go with the speed boat, its faster and more fun. The beaches are very beautifull and you will be surprise that Maya Bay that so famous with the film ""The Beach"" is trully wonderful. My kids favorite spot was the Khai island, they can feed the fish right on the beach, the water is clear and lots of fish. No need snorkling gear for even little babies can see the fish and touch the fish.Second day try canoeing in Krabi near Phuket, you will see different scenery here, wonderfull experience you can try paddling canoe by your self through canyon and watch wild live animal near you or you might want to try different kind of canoeing experience you can try in Pangga provice where they provide you a paddling man and all you need to do is sit back and relax they will guide you to get in to caves and believe me its quite an adrenalin pumping experience too. We had so much fun in Phuket."
50,“First timer in Phuket”,"My husband and I have just returned from a 10 day holiday in phuket, Duane has already written a review on here so I thought i would add my bit....What to take?Pack very lightly if you intend to shop, laundry service is very cheap, around 60 baht(about $1.80 aus) a kilo and they iron it too!!. take small travel size shampoos and accessories.Most hotels have hair dryers and some like ours had free internet, so no real need for the laptop.Shopping:We stayed at Karon beach which was beautiful, its main st had plenty of Atms and money exchanges, a couple of 7/11 shops to buy milk, snacks etc..lots of cafe/resturants and plenty of market stalls..oh and a great beach too.My first shopping experience was a tad daunting as the locals really do try to pressure you into buying, having said that, they are quite polite in doing so. I studied the price list that cathy put on here and used that as my guide.The sellers will try to get you to buy a number of items and then will give you a price for all of them, this price will be top dollar and way over the price, this is where the bartering begins........I learnt to add up my items in my head so i knew what roughly i would pay so EG: 2 x mens billabong board shorts, 2x billabong mens singlets, 2 x mens polo golf shirts. the seller will probably give a price like 3200 baht(about $100 aus), I add it up using lower than the amount reccomended for each item EG: board shorts150bht each, singlets 100 bht each, golf shirts150 bht each, total of 800 bht(about $20 aus), this leaves me room to barter up to the reccomended price. Seller will then looked shocked and show me another price of maybe 2800 whilst expressing how cheap that is!!, I will then go up a bit to 1000 bht or I will put in the top price i will pay which would be no more than 250 bht each for shorts, 200 for singlets, 250 for golf shirts so the most i will pay is 1400 bht (about $45) .Try not to buy too many items at once as it can become confusing trying to add up, convert money and barter at the same time....If you are after Brand handbags,watches or DVDs you will most likely be taken to a back room, We paid 50 bht per disc for movies, tv series,music cds. The bags will range in price, I worked on anywhere between 1000 and 1400 per bag depending on size and brand and how many, Lois Vitton seems to be the dearest. The quality is very good and i was happy with all my purchases.Just remember to smile, be nice and say no thankyou if you cant agree on a price, you will more than likely win the barter, so theres no need for anger.We also shopped in patong a lot, it has many many stalls/shops, I found the markets at the back behind Beach Rd were not as daunting as the beach rd ones, meaning wearnt as inyour face as the beach rd ones are. As you walk along the street you will be asked by every stalll holder to ""come have a look my shop madam"" or ""you want tshrit madam"" and evry 2nd store is a tailor and they will offer you best price suits, so be prepared. Try to be polite and ""no thankyou"" goes a long way, even though you will be totally sick of it in 10 minutes..lol.Duane had a suit made and it took 3/4 days it cost 6000 Bht (about$200 aus)for a 3 piece long jacket suit which is very nice and very well made.We had a small laminated card made before we went,with the conversion of baht to $ to make it easy reference while shopping.Take a list of prices from this website with you to study and enjoy your shopping!!. If you pay a bit more than you wanted its no big deal as its all a hell of a lot cheaper than here...Cheers vickie"
50,“The Best Tour Agency in Phuket - Woody Travel & Tour”,"My husband and I were enjoy very much our 5 days 4 night short trip in Phuket last week. Before I went phuket, many poeple who experienced in Phuket told me that there is nothing in Phuket, all islands and boring, nothing can do in phuket.... So, I didn't put high expectation for this trip. After I did a lot of price comparison from web site, I decided to book some activities from Wooddy Travel website (http://www.phuketeasytour.com).Unfortunately, when the day we going to Phuket, we had miss our flight, we forced to buy flight ticket again and need to wait another 4 hours to depature to Phuket. Our mood was very bad that time. After 4 hours, plus another 1.5 hours travel, we finally arrive in Phuket airport. However, another bad luck was came, whole airport was no electric supply. We walking in dark from Airport.... Can you imagine how is our feel and mood that moment??When we walked out from Airport, we met Mr.Wooddy. He gave us a warm welcome and keep on console us. He upgrades our tour program to be more interesting for free, because he wants us to forget about our bad luck and bad mood, he wants us to enjoy holiday in Phuket.First day, he brought us to go phuket town and some phuket viewpoints, he also explain all history about Phuket to us. When dinner time, he brought us to go somewhere special to have seafood on the beach. That place called ""Kan Eang Seafood"", food is excellent and price is much more cheaper than Patong Beach. We enjoy our dinner very much!Second day, we went for 4 in 1 James Bond Islands Canoeing. Mr. Wooddy arrange a very good tour company for this activity. We love their service and professional. They are PPT. 4 in 1 James Bond Islands Canoeing is very interesting activity, we love it very much.Third day, we went to Phi-Phi island by big boat. Although it takes a bit long time to go Phi-Phi island, we enjoy the sea sight, the wind, the warm sun on the boat. What a bonus for us was, we saw a flying fish from boat, it is cool!! From Phi-Phi island beach, we saw a lot of friendly and colourful fishes, we love the clean and clear sea very much.Last day, we went for white water rafting! Wow.... it was cool!! We are beginner of rafting, so try the most junior level of this activities. Next round, we will back again the try the senior level of rafting! It really a very good experience for us!At night, we went for Simon Cabaret show. We ask for booking at the last minute time, but we still request Mr.Wooddy to book a VIP seats for us. Mr. Wooddy was did a good job, we got a VIP seat in the middle. We sit at the last row in the middle, we can see the whole stage very clear. Another bonus for us was, the manager at Simon Cabaret show, give us extra drinking water, extra pillow to let us sit higher and move our seats to extra behind so we can see the stage clearer!! Simon Cabaret really an excellent show in Phuket! We really enjoy the show!After this trip, I felt that Phuket is wonderful, full of supprise and it is the best place to spend a long holiday!! We regret that we don't have a long holiday in Phuket, we are looking forward the next long holiday to challenge other activities in Phuket!!The only thing which disappoint us and almost affect our mood was, the worst hotel in Patong, Patong Premier Resort. We really disappointed and unhappy with their bad services. We regret didn't accept Mr. Wooddy's advice to get other hotel at the beginning. So, we got lesson now. Next Phuket trip, we will let Mr. Wooddy to arrange our whole trip, because now I know he will 100% provides the best services for us.For tour activities, we really satisfy and happy with Wooddy Travel & Tour. Mr. Wooddy is friendly and always concern about what customers' needed. Wooddy Travel & Tour gives us a wonder experience in Phuket. Now, I can tell poeple around that, Phuket is not nothing, Phuket is full of Fun!!Sincerely,Mandy & Louis"
50,"“Patong Beach-Phuket, Thailand”","My boyfriend and I just returned from a holiday in Thailand and it was great! We stayed at the Seaview Hotel in Patong Beach and everything was very close by and easily accessible. We'd never been before so a couple things caught us off guard. Some things to be aware of before you go is the private taxi guys. They offer a great price and it really is a very inexpensive way to get around. Around Phuket area (local sights surrounding the area and local beaches) they asked around $500 THB which was something like $16.60 AUD and that was for both of us together for like all day. We used different private taxi guys on several occassions and price-wise they were all pretty similar. The little SCAM that most of them have going is that they will take you where you want but they will also take you to these 'Gem Showrooms' along the way. Even if you say 'no thanks' they are still very insistent and may take you to several throughout your day. How it works is they get a 'stamp' for $100 THB each time they bring people through. You don't have to buy anything, they simply want you to walk through and back out. That's how they get a bit of extra money there. Other than being an annoyance, it doesn't cost you anything other than about probably 5-10 minutes all up to get out, walk through and be on your way again. We got very insistent with one and said that we didn't want to go again and he explained how it works. We agreed that time but from then on out when getting a private taxi we negotiated our price and once inside clearly stated that we would NOT stop at anywhere to look around. They do this with the Cashew Warehouse too. As menioned, it is a really cheap way to get around, you just have to be aware of what to expect. Metered taxis aren't as plentiful there as the private taxis and tuk tuks but all are fine, just negotiate your price BEFORE accepting and getting in. Also you should be able to negotiate the price down to about 60% of their offering price (as with most things in the Phuket area). They'll come down a fair amount anyway, so be sure to bargain. Just keep in mind that they do do a fair amount of work for next to nothing at the end of the day so don't make a big fuss over small amounts (i.e if they ask $450THB don't try for $425 as it's such a small amount. Just let them have it-they already have little to begin with.The other thing is with walking through the shopping areas and bars: the store owners literally grab your hands and arms (sometimes put their arms around you and drag you in) in an effort to pull you into their shop. It's very confronting as you feel as though you are being terribly nasty and ill-mannered but you nicest thing to do is to simply say ""my ow kah"" (if you are a female you say thi) or ""my ow krab"" (if you are a male you say this) which is a polite way to say 'no thank you'. It works well most times but sometimes takes repeating. They are heaps more aggressive in the bars area with the grabbing and pulling as they want you to come in. It feels terribly mean and nasty but you just have to sort of either say this or just not look at the people speaking to you or they won't leave you alone. You'll soon learn the tone you must take.It's a GREAT place to go and we would definitely go back again, just keep these things in mind so you know what to expect.Hope it helps....enjoy! =)"
20,“Good tourist spot but overall disappointed”,"This was my second time to Phuket and I was extremely disappointed with the overall experience. We arrived to rainy weather. Luckily, the bus service at the airport was quite convenient and we were driven to our hotel in no time.Phuket Island used to be beautiful in 2001. This time around, it wasn't as beautiful. So many electrical lines everywhere obstructing our view. I admit the 2004 tsunami must have damaged quite a lot of the island, but I would have thought that the reconstruction could have been better. A lot more asphalt and buildings then there used to be.Foodwise: We were extremely disappointed with the food. We stayed at Patong Beach and it was a challenge to find authentic Thai cuisine. There was Chinese food, American food, Indian Food, Arabic Food... And to think we were looking forward to authentic Thai cuisine. We were better off in Bangkok! The price is of food has skyrocketed. Phuket isn't the tropical paradise for the money-conscience anymore! On the other hand, we found the price of seafood at the open-air restaurants quite cheap. Fish steamed in lemon garlic sauce, Crab and prawns are delicious.Constant harrassment from vendors. We were constantly harrassed by Thai girls for massages, and Indians and Burmians to buy clothing and souvenirs. It wasn't even possible to stroll down the street quietly. Very unpleasant.Beach: The beach was crowded and dirty. Trash isn't picked up on the beach and it makes the place look unkept.Tours: The Fantasea Show is a MUST. It's amazing as always. Just as wonderful as I had remembered it. Even the buffet dinner was good. Such a great value for the money. We also took the VIP one-day boat cruise. It was a horrendous tourist trap. We were sped from island to island in full speed trhought the waves. It was raining and there were so many people on the boat we could not even take cover. We were drenched and we had minor bruises from the boatride! Snorkeling was a speed thing. They gave us 10 minutes and charged us extra for slippers. Relaxing on the beaches meant paying for more chairs and money to use the washrooms as well. Koh Phi Phi isn't the way it used to be. Hundreds of tourist boats... Not my idea of a paradise island...Overall, we were disappointed with Phuket. There were very few Thai friendliness around. A lot of immigrants trying to make a living and ruining our vacation there. If you are looking for a cheap Thai island getaway and don't like the overtouristy spots, you're better off at Koh Samui."
50,“A must see!”,"Although the 19 hr flight from NYC is not the easiest to do...if you stay up for 24-48 hrs prior to the flight, it's a piece of cake! Once you arrive, it is all worth the trip. The beaches are mesmerizing, the people friendly, the food is cheap and delicious and the massages are so cheap, why not get one a day? One cannot go to Phuket without taking a day trip to the beautiful Ko Phi Phi (Pronounced Ko Pee Pee) islands. The snorkeling, diving, and swimming are amazing! Fish can be seen everywhere (even without entering the water). The monkeys on Monkey Island are fun to watch and feed and the many different islands you can just relax on are OUT OF THIS WORLD! I would definitely return to Thailand. Worth the money. Everything is SUPER CHEAP!"
50,“Beautiful Beaches”,"We loved Phuket, and especially our little trip over to maya bay. We took a ferry from Phuket to the Phi Phi ilsands and then had a fisherman take us over to maya bay. It was the most beautiful place I've ever been.Phuket had lots of places to shop and eat. We loved the fresh pineapple that you could get everywhere."
30,“Holidaying in Phuket”,"During our family September 2009 holiday in Phuket, we stayed at Patong Beach. We were quite surprised with the transformation of Patong Beach into a nightlife holiday resort (we were there 12 years back). But still there are many family oriented activities around Patong and Phuket Island. We chose a full day excursion tour to Maya Bay / Monkey Beach, Phi Phi Island, and Khai Island.There were 3 types of excursion to Phi Phi Island:1. Big Boat (Ferry type) which was the cheapest (B 700 - 800 for adult) and could take more than one hundred passangers. With this big boat, the excursion is slower, more relaxing, but limited to Phi Phi Island area only. This is a one day cruise type excursion.2. Big Speed Boat which cost B 900 - 1000 for adult and B 700 - 800 for children. This boat could handle upto 45 passangers and was fast. Depending on the water condition, this speedboat sometimes might not go to all islands especially Khai Island. You have to clearly ask.3. Small Speed boat which took upto 25 passangers. It cost B 1200 - 1300 for adult and B 1000 - 1100 for children. The tour operator guaranteed a visit to all the offered destinations.The above fares were our bargained prices. The offered prices were B 300 - 400 more perpax. After some bargaining, we decided to take the small speed boat excursion. The outbound trip was very exciting and nice because the water was calm and the day was sunny. First stop was Phi Phi Lae where we swam around in a bay. Nothing much here. Next we moved to Maya Bay where we swam and snorkeled to see many colourful fishes. We fed bread to fishes which swam around us....very neat indeed. We could not land on monkey beach due to high tide and ended up feeding monkeys from our boat. After enough snorkeling and swimming, we moved to Phi Phi Don Island for lunch. Western and asian dishes were served. Coffee, tea, and cold water were nice refreshments after hot day at the sea. From Phi Phi Don, we moved to Khai Island. The trip was supposedly to be 1 hour by speed boat, but due to rough water the trip took longer and bumpier. Very bumpy and a bit scarry. The captain had to manouvered around big waves. We were quite relieved when we reached Khai Island and were greeted by colourful fishes on knee deep water. Quite amazing and exciting to feel fishes around your legs as you fed them. Some naughty ones even nibbled at your legs. After about an hour on Khai, we were quickly heading back to Phuket due to incoming thunderstorm warning.Tips for taking this trip:1. Find a tour vendor and bargain. Ask 2 - 3 vendors before you decide which one to book. Clearly ask itenerary as some vendors will not tell you if one or two destinations are cancelled.For family with children, It is better to take a bigger speedboat (second option) or big boat (first option).2. Wear your swimsuits before boarding the boat (especially speed boat). There is no changing room on board. Bring hats, sunsreen lotion, towels, and spare shirt. Bring B 500 to 1000 per family for beach chair rental at Khai (B 150 for 2 beach chairs) and tips to boat operators and tour guide (Around B 100 per family) . Otherwise there is nothing else to buy.3. If offered seasick pill, take it. The boat ride can be very bumpy and cause bad seasickness.4. Snorkels, drinks, snacks are usually offered on board free of charge. I don't think swimming fins help much.Andri SW"
50,“what a beautiful place to visit”,"I recently visited Phuket Thailand on my first overseas trip with a friend. I didn't know what to expect really, even after reading everything possible on the beautiful location.This is a very poor country but the people smile all the time and are so grateful for anything you do or say to them. Even a small tip for services that they provide lights up their whole face. I realise I am so lucky to live in australia and I don't have anything to complain about after seeing how poor these people are but who never complain.There is so much to do in Phuket. Shopping, day trips to various islands, elephant trekking, visiting temples and even seeing the monks, snorkelling, relaxing, watch Thai boxing, cabarets and the various sights you see at night time.what a magnificent place to visit. If you are thinking of going please go. You will have the time of your life just like I did."
50,“jbr”,"Just back after 16 days in Phuket. Last year we flew Thai to Bkk then on to Phuket. Decided to fly Jetstar as it is a direct flight from Sydney. So glad we did. It was a much shorter trip and the flight/service was good.After having done much research we decided to stay again at the Club Andaman Beach Resort in a deluxe balcony room on the 6th floor which was clean and comfortable. We love the grounds and pool area. There seems to be a lot more outside space than similar hotels in the area. We have found our spot and will be back next year.After an extremely busy and stressful year we were looking forward to a relaxing holiday. Last year we did some tours, elephant ride, sunset cruise etc however this year we wanted to chill out.Up every morning at 6am, breakfast, walk on the beach, swim, shower, massage, lunch, happy hour, quick nap if were lucky or another massage, off out for dinner.We loved The Beach restaurant, Chez Bernard and The Tipsy Prawn. Scruffy Murphy's in Bangla was great for a drink and to watch the world walk by. We tried Roma's but preferred an Italian restaurant with wood fire pizza in the soi at the top of Bangla. We loved the pizza so much we went there 4 times. A couple of expats said it had the best pizza and we have to agree. They also recommended the Yorkshire Inn for a roast dinner, but unfortunately we didn't manage to get there. Also splurged at Patong Seafood one night which was good. It is not as inexpensive as I thought it would be. Can't remember how much the lobster was but it was delicious.Went to the Aussie Bar to watch the footy a couple of times and bought a polo shirt. Not into bar mats.Did most of our shopping at Jinda's shop opposite the tourist police station and La Salsa restaurant in Beach Road. We didn't have to go through the whole bargaining process and got a good price for the tshirts, singlets, shorts etc.Purchased a quilt cover set for 1300 baht from the shop next door to Jinda's from a lovely deaf girl. She must find it difficult as she cannot speak either and is unable to call out to passers by.Bought a couple of Findig leather bags in a shop along Beach Rd. Not sure of the name but has set prices, currently up to 80% off. The bags were about $AUD55.We walked everywhere except for our second last day when our friends arrived. We took a tuk tuk ride up through Kamala, Surin, Bangtao and up toYai Nang as they wanted to check out a hotel there for their son. We showed them around Patong and they will be doing some tours this week as it is their first visit there.We had massages everday at Amazing Thai Massage just behind Club Andaman. The ladies there were so friendly and gave us gifts when we left.My husband tried out the beers and is quite partial now to Leo but also likes Singha and Tiger.We love the Thai people who are so friendly and happy. Can't wait to go back next year.I love reading trip advisor and thanks to everyone for their contributions. I found Cathy & Gary's pages extremely helpful."
30,“Good first experience”,"Just back from Phuket. Will try to make this review as honest as possible!Mother, sister and I just returned from about 7 days in Phuket.Arrived in Phuket, checked into Novotel Phuket Resort. Excellent hotel, lots of stairs so you get pretty fit! Located at north end of Phuket beach, close main attractions of Patong but also a good distance away. Not right in the hustle and bustle of everything if that is what your looking for. Great buffet breakfast incl with room, some food a little pricey but we had no other option because there wasn't much that end of the beach apart from the 7/11 which was handy. Bar had great cheap drinks, fantastic milkshakes! GREAT STAFF. Highly recommend the hotel, although probably not for people who want to be smack bang in all the action of Patong Beach.Went for a walk down Rat-U-Thit road/ Bangla etc; bit hard to find your way around, no street signs ha ha! This would of been handy.We found it easiest to walk along Patong Beach and look for hotels/landmarks that correspond with the streets. Patong beach was great - Jetski/Parasailing looked fantastic!Shopping along Patong Beach and Bangla road was good - I know there are lots of tips on shopping in this forum, but really the easiest thing to do is just shop where you want to and pay what your happy too. TIP - take a calculator to work out the exchange rate and what your paying, very handy. Jungceylon was also good, but upon my return was informed by a friend that there were two parts to the building, one of which I hadn't discovered!!! Should've looked out for that! Apparently we had only seen one side of the shopping centre ha ha.Phuket town shopping was OK. . My advice would be to go there for a look but really, its all same same and not very different! It's the same stuff everywhere really! Central Festival was quite good. But as I said, its the same everywhere. I reckon do all the major shopping spots once then just concentrate on the ones near where your staying.Went to the OTOP near the Patong Merlin Resort one night - wouldn't recommend. Most stall holders were very annoying and pushy which turned us off. But it was HUGE. But again, its all the same stuff you can get on the beach or at Jungceylon.Mum and sister did an elephant ride which they loved! Highly recommended.Tuk Tuks and taxi's were all good. Just agree on the price before you get in, you'll have no problems. And make sure they drop you where you want to be dropped - one man wanted to drop us a street down from where we were paying him to take us (I think it was easier for him to turn around?) but we told him no, to drop us where we wanted to be, and he did.Simons Cabaret worth the $30 - good laugh, good costumes.Also had a rhinoplasty at Bangkok Phuket Hospital so anyone interested in that sort of stuff can PM me. Very happy with result and all staff at hospital.Really stormy weather while we were there! Rained non stop for about 1 day/night. Didn't really impede on our plans, but Patong beach itself pretty much closed down and we imagined most of the island tours would have too.Worst thing about Phuket was the stall holders/ taxi drivers constantly asking 'Tuk tuk? Taxi? Look in my shop' etc etc etc. Possibly worse because it was low season, either way it got annoying, best way to deal with it is to just totally ignore them and pretend you don't speak english ha ha! Not a MAJOR hindrance but it was just annoying.All in all, Phuket was great experience. Wouldn't go back again, once is enough for us. Can see it would be paradise if you were into the beach/shopping/nightlife scene, but once we'd been there and done the shopping and seen the sites and stayed for 7 nights we were ready to get back home. All a good experience!Now looking forward to Singapore 2010!"
40,"“Kata Villas, Karon beach”","this is a small budget hotel i spent 5 days at in May 2009, at 500 baht per night in the low season this proved to be an excellent choice for someone like me, who had a comparatively small budget.The room was perfectly clean and adequate. The staff friendly and helpful.The hotel is only a stones throw from the start of Karon beach and is situated basically on the border between Karon and Kata.Its has a small pool that was nice for a quick refreshing dip.If eating at the hotel food was very reasonably priced, with a tendency to cater for visitors from continental Europe.there was an all in breakfast for 100 baht comprising eggs, bacon. ham. cheese! coissant, toast and jam and yogurt and all the tea coffee you could drink!! very good value really.my only criticism was a lack of variety with the breakfast, eggs were always fried.And my thai lady did not really want to eat there as there was comparatively little thai food.But all in all for the price you could not go wrong.amazingly this hotel had better air conditioning than the much more expensive hotel i moved to after my 5 day stay (the pacific club and spa)Kata villas is heavily recommended by myself for the budget traveller who likes the simple life!"
30,“Phuket Is Not For Family With Young Children”,"Good points about Phuket:-Fresh air and open space-easy and anything goesBad points:-not much things to do for young children. These would be the places you would find you visit most often: Tesco Lutos's Play Port, Big C Play Port, Macdonald Play port, the beach, the park- A lot of restaurant do not offer high chairs for inflant/young toddlers.- A lot of restaurant do not offer kids meal with the exception of S&P, Black Canon(the obvious ones to me)-Anything of reasonable quality is expensive- The only shopping center/departmental store that offers Nursery Room for infants/young children is Central"
50,“Mountian Biking Coast to Coast Phuket to Surat Thani”,"Recently did a trip from Phuket to Surat Thani with Dave Williams and his crew from Thai Cycle.Starting from the Sarasin Bridge, North Phuket, we headed out over 10 days across the Southern Thai peninsula for Surat Thani. Dave has an open sided bus specifically adapted for up to 10 bikes and riders which acts as a support vehicle. Bike are available for rent or bring your own. A 5 day option is also available.The trails are a far cry from those offered by together companies with a LOT of single track, gravel paths or rural gravel roads. They really go out of their way to ensure a peaceful and natural experience. Riding varies slightly with a few hills in the early days but very pleasant overall. Riding through the limestone karsts in Phang Nga is awesome and the areas around Surat Thani a real delight for cross country riders. I spent almost an entire day zipping between trees on single track with Elton John's ""Rocked man"" on a loop in my headLodging is basic but comfortable with fan or aircon rooms for you to lay your head at the end of the day. Massages are available at some stops and should not be missed. Food is real Thai local and a true taste of Thailand - not the Euro Thai variations you get in the tourist spots in PhuketProfessional guides qualified in more than basic english made this a true winner. Qualified in first aid with proper medical backup together with the knowledge of the local areas and especially the fauna and bird life made this a very educational experience on top of being one of the nicest rides I have ever done."
40,“royal paradise hotel phuket”,"Just gor back from Phuket, was a bit worried after a fair amount of negative reviews on the royal paradise. What a relief to find hotel was great rooms although not luxurious were really nice, clean and contained all we needed to make it a comfortable place to stay. The staff were really nice and more than helpful, pool area brilliant and although located right in the heart of the place felt totally safe.Phuket as amazing as expected, some things not as cheap as I thought but still cheap enough and the boat trip with captain mark is a must.Lynn 24/4/9"
50,“Pearl of the Andaman Sea”,"I rented a car which allowed me to see much of what Phuket Island had to offer in the week I spent. I'll focus on three beaches; Karon, Surin, Rawai, and infamous Patong.For the beach and upscale offerings, Karon has much to offer. The sand is simply the best here. Long stretches of soft sand that squeaks as you walk. The crowd here is more mature, older, and the hotels and boardwalk tilt towards that clientele with more upscale touches. Nightlife exists here but very, very muted compared with Patong. If you're young and looking for nightlife, you'll have to trek to Patong.Surin was a real gem because it's more undiscovered with smaller crowds. It also had the best swimming in my opinion. Clean, transluscent water. Here you can eat right on the beach and the restaurants are fantastic. Surin is very romantic at night with all the beachside restaurants lit up with torches.For nightlife you really must be in Patong Beach. The nightlife is raucous but a bit sleazy of course. Couples can have a great time but do keep an eye on your girlfriend. Too many drunk men for it to be absolutely safe at night. The Tiger Disco I enjoyed most. Lots of drunken debauchery.Rawai Beach is the place to go to buy pearls and seashells. Dirt cheap because they raise the pearls here, just make sure it's real. The restaurants here serve delicious seafood for much smaller prices than what you would get on the more popular beaches. Just don't come to Rawai for sand and water, it's more like a harbor than anything else.If you're looking to get away from the beaches, near Phuket Town is a monkey park that I really enjoyed. Hundreds of monkeys just running around and this experience is free which is why you won't see it advertised in big letters.Promthep Cape was beautiful. The sunset I saw here was the most stunning I've ever seen.The Big Buddha statue is definitely worth checking out if not for the spiritual aspect just for the amazing view of the bottom half of Phuket Island."
20,“Merlin Beach Resort Tuk Tuk disappointment”,I have just returned from spending 16 days at the Merling Beach Resort for the second time after being married there almost 3 years previously. My experience this time was more disappointing. We had dinner in the resort 2 nights and there seems to be only one kitchen catering for some 4 odd restaraunts. 1st meal was extremely delayed with all food coming out at different times and the second meal was inedible.My biggest problem with the overall holiday was the problems with getting taxis/tuk tuks into Patong from the front of the hotel. Now I do understand these are not linked to the hotel but unfortunately this alone has swayed my decision to not return to the Merlin Beach Resort in the future. If a price is advertised at the front of the hotel then surely this is the price to be paid. If the sign is incorrect then it needs to be changed. I feel we had the same argument with the drivers every night and they seem to make the prices up as they go. This had made my mind up to stay closer to Patong in the future so we do not have to worry about catching taxis. There also seems to be a new club that is catered for at Merling Beach Resort. Exotic Blue or something along those lines. I think it is a package for swedish or german tourists. This seems to take up one side of the hotel and the pool with the kids pool caters only for this group. As a non member of this group I felt with a 10 month old child I could not access the kids pool.
50,“Phang Nga Bay my paradise”,"I had traveled to Phuket, Sourthen Thailand last month. For most of the people, staying by the beach is the first choice. However, I stayed at Phuket City. Firstly it was due to the hotel is cheaper in the city and Backpacker Hostel is cozy and reasonable priced.One of the unforgettable activity was the trip to Phang Nga Bay. It's a bay consist of many big and small islands popping out from the sea. On the way towards the bay, the view was marvelous. For most of the view when sailing out to the sea where you see only a horizon of sea, for this Phang Nga Bay in Thailand, it's fantastic!For the details of my trip, visit my personal blog at http://itraveltheworld.wordpress.com. You would see beautiful photos there too.If you visit Phuket, it wasn't complete without the Phang Nga Bay sailing.from christene222"
40,“Phuket - an honest opinion”,"Having lived in Phuket for just over 3 years I have seen plenty of positives and negatives. Here are a few of things I would recommend seeing (or avoiding) for the first time visitor.To see the real side of life in Phuket, take a trip to Phuket Town. It's much less touristy than the beach resorts but still has much to offer. There are many excellent restaurants in and around town (particularly seafood places) which serve up authentic Thai food cooked the way the locals eat it. Far too often in the beach areas, the Thai food will automatically be prepared to cater to western tastes (i.e. desensitized for spices and taste (although this may well be preferable to some depending on your tolerance to spices). There are also a good number of ludicrously cheap options for western food, including pasta for around 60 baht (about 1 pound uk sterling) or pizza for 200 baht, which is a fraction of the cost you would pay in the overpriced beach resorts.If you are travelling on a bit of a budget then Town may be a good option for you as accommodation is considerably cheaper than the beach areas, which are mostly still accessible by Public buses (although this do stop by about 4 in the afternoon)Phuket Town has a good number of bars and clubs and while they cater to a predominately Thai crowd, most if not all are foreigner friendly and good for a night out. Unlike in the beach resorts you can take your own bottle (usually Whiskey) into almost any bar or club in Phuket Town and only pay a small charge for corkage as well as mixers and ice.There is weekend market on the southern edge of town every Saturday and Sunday from 4pm, which is a great place to grab a bite to eat at one of the many food stalls (if you try the bbq'd insects you're more adventurous than me!) or just shop around for cheap trinkets or t-shirts which are ridiculously cheap. You have to bargain but it is relaxed and easy here and you will not be ripped off in the same way as you may be in Patong or the busier tourist spots.In the early evening locals like to congregate in the Kings Park (Suang Luang) to jog around the lake or play badminton, basketball or the popular Thai sport of Takraw. It's a beautiful setting a great place for a relaxing stroll after the hottest part of the day.Phuket does have many absolutely stunning beaches which rival the best I have visited worldwide. Your preference will depend on what you are looking for. For sheer beauty I would recommend Nai Harn and Kata Noi (little Kata beach) in the south west. Both offer large expanses of golden sand (and tend to be a bit less crowded) and ideal swimming conditions in the high season between approximately November - April *Note: you should not swim in the sea around Phuket at all (or only with extreme caution) during other times of the year as sea conditions can be extremely dangerous with large waves and deceptively strong currents. Sadly many tourists are victims of drowning every year for failing to heed such warnings.Surin is an upmarket resort area on the west coast with a beautiful beach. It's mostly 4-5 star accommodation in this area though so not one for budget travelers. Laem Singh is also a great little beach to visit in between Surin and Kamala (it's completely hidden from view from the road), although you will have to hire a taxi for the day to get there unless you have your own transport.There are some beautiful quiet beaches in the very north of the island close to the airport such as Nai Yang and Mai Khao, which are mostly overlooked by tourists and practically deserted (but beautiful and unspoiled nonetheless)Patong is easily the busiest and most touristy of the beach resorts. Essentially it's a tacky tourist town with everything (and I do mean everything!) available on tap. If your're looking for a quiet vacation with a bit of culture you'll likely hate it - whereas if you're looking for a good time with a few beers and a bit of hedonism you'll likely love it! For me - I think it can be great fun for a night out but i'd never stay there longer than that. Unfortunately, you are also far more likely to be ripped off in Patong than most other parts of the island.My best advice would be to avoid Tuk Tuk's all together unless you have no other choice. There a few good apples amongst the bad but sadly these are the exception rater than the rule. Many are rude, overly aggressive and overcharge (2-300% or more of the 'fair' price is not uncommon.You must bargain in the markets for t-shirts and souvenirs. Reckon on being quoted more than double a sensible price (for example, I have seen tourists being asked to pay 800 baht for t-shirts which will be sold for as little as 100). If you bargain with a smile and a joke you will likely achieve a much more favourable outcome.The one other massive downside of Patong (and to a much lesser extent some other beach areas such as Kata) is the constant rude and intrusive behaviour of the seemingly never ending number of tailors that ply their trade up and down the beach road and adjoining streets. It is bad enough constantly having to decline the persistent offers to buy a suit whilst listening to their pathetic attempts to say g'day mate in a ridiculous Australian accent (for some reason every tourist here must be Australian), however, I totally draw the line at being grabbed by the arm and stopped while i'm walking along by a complete stranger. Hawking is a persistent problem the world over and by and large can be simply ignored with a polite smile. Unwanted physical contact is too much though and these people are sadly the very worst of what you will see in Phuket.For me, one of the very best things about Phuket is the food. Fans of seafood will have an absolute field day here (especially as it is all so cheap by nearly all western standards). Eating in the local places can be a little intimidating unless you speak a little Thai but can be a rewarding experience with excellent food at extremely cheap prices (the look of the restaurant on the outside is often no reflection whatsoever of the quality of the food therein). Pla Nueng Manau (steamed fish in lemon and chili sauce) and Pla Neung Buay (steamed fish in Chinese plum sauce) are popular specialties, whist Hor Mok ( a local dish of fish custard wrapped in a banana leaf is delicious.*For a unique experience, take a trip by longtail boat (the boat ride is free) out to the floating seafood restaurants (accessible from Laem Hin pier on the eastern side of Phuket Town). These are a collection of 4 independently owned restaurants built on floating pontoons in the middle of the bay, with views of Koh Maprao (the Coconut island) opposite the mainland.One thing to beware if you are visiting Phuket or even Thailand for the first time is that the concept of service here is completely different to that in the west. For example, it is not uncommon at all for dishes to arrive at up to 20 minute intervals (although this should never happen at the more expensive westernised places) and on frequent occasions either myself or one of my dining companions may have finished eating before the other is served their meal. There is little point in complaining as the staff at the restaurant will not understand what you are upset about. It is just a different culture here (brought about largely by the fact that Thai's usually share all food communally rather than ordering individual dishes). Also, there is a habit of 'lying' to customers rather than admitting they do not have something (for example, if you ask for Ketchup and the restaurant doesn't have it, you may often be told it is coming repeatedly until you give up asking rather than being told they do not stock it as the staff are scared of offending you. This may seem strange to you and I, but is just one of the many cultural differences so in such circumstances it's probably best to just shrug your shoulders and smile!Temples are not really my thing but Wat Chalong (the biggest temple on the island) is quite impressive and worth a look. Better still is the recently completed Big Buddha statue high in the hills in the south west of Phuket. I believe it's the biggest of it's kind in Thailand and it's absolutely worth a trip to the top to see it (notwithstanding the fact that the views from the summit are breathtaking)."
40,“It's Fun Time in Phuket!”,"Phuket is another famous island of Thailand where it is very much well-received internationally. It is an island that never sleeps and there is almost something for everyone! Holidays in Phuket can never be boring unless you plan to tie up yourself in a room!I was in Phuket for a 4 days 3 nights trip and there was not a boring moment for me.After being picked up by the hotel transfer bus, there was a tour guide on board the bus who briefed me on the series of activities which I could do in Phuket. The list of activities offered were: island hopping to places like phi phi island, coral island etc; real gun shooting with real bullets; All Terrain Vehicle Adventure; Horse Riding in the forests; Phuket Fantasea; Phuket Zoo and many others phuket night life!Of course, all these come at some cost but it will be all worthwhile at the end of the days as you will find yourself enjoying the activities!As I was only on a 4 days trip, I only managed to participate in the following activities:1) Excursion to Phi Phi IslandFerry Ride to Phi Phi Island:I was on board a rather spacious ferry where it was stable and big enough that I saw no one getting seasick! It was quite a long ride of about 4hours, but most of the times you would be indulged in the nice seaview sceneries you would forget about the time on board the ship.It will be reccommended that you bring along a book to read!Waters on Phi Phi IslandThe beach was clean with clear waters. However, there seemed not to have a variety of marine life during snorkeling. The seawalk was a little disappointing also as they did not have an oxygen tank mask. All they had was the usual diving apparatus and I had to learn to breathe through the mouth piece. This was a bit of problem for me as I had never tried diving! And again, there were not a variety of fishes and corals so it was not really impressive.Shops on Phi Phi IslandThere were quite a good number of shops on the island and one could expect to do some decent shopping. Prices were relatively cheap but please remember to bargain! There were also currency exchanges so one need not worry about not having enough cash.Food on Phi Phi IslandThere was a lunch included in my Excursion to Phi Phi Island but the food was not really tasty. However, it was pleasant and definitely edible.The downside of the excursion might well be that there weren't enough time allocated for me to roam around and do some swimming and relaxing on the beach. In addition, there were not much places for one to clean up after the sea activities. So one could get quite uncomfortable after coming up from the sea. There were limited toilet facilities.2) Gun ShootingThe gun shooting would be fun for cops wannabe! There was the option of the normal pistol or a rifle. Real bullets were used so one better be careful! There was nothing for me to worry as there was a guide with me to ensure security. At the end of the session, the guide counted my points and access how I had fared. Quite professional!3) Horse RidingIt was a thrill for my first time horse riding! This was especially so as the trainers taught me the basic techniques of horse riding. After guiding the horse for like 20minutes, they let me had a free reign of the horse in the forest tracks! It was scary and exciting for a first timer like me as my horse kept eyeing for the delicious grasses along the way. This kept me nervous. But at the end of the ride, there was a strange sense of achievement and I would definitely love to ride a horse again!4) All-Terrain-VehiclesThe All-Terrain-Vehicles was also an all time favourite as the muddy tracks and slopes are pretty exciting. There were a few times when I thought I almost fell into the muddy pot holes. Thank God that I didn't! Their vehicles were pretty new, big enough to be stable, and easy to manipulate. The guide will also take a picture for you as a souvenir! An experience to be remembered.Other than the adventures being the highlights of the trip, food was just as good in Phuket! The seafood there is delicious at good prices! I ate fishes and shark fins' soup everyday and the thought of it just made me hungry!Nightlife filled the city centre where there are alot of pubs and clubs. It's a paradise for the men! Beer and Women are the theme of the nights.Although the beach in Patong is clean and the waters quite blue, I didnt get to enjoy it much as the sun is really too hot for my liking! Just a 20minutes under the umbrella shade set my mind wondering if i was placed in an oven for toasting. I guess it was at least at a temperature of 37 Degree Celsius. Simply unbearable.On the overall, the Phuket is definitely FUN FUN FUN for the adventure lovers. However, shopping is not highly recommended for Phuket as their shopping malls and areas are really limited. All shopaholics should go Bangkok! Otherwise, it's FUN FUN FUN in Phuket. Don't forget to bring yourself home!"
50,“Phuket”,"its a lovely place, paradise on earth. incredibly beautiful. gr8 place for nature lovers. lots to do, speed boats, snorkeliing, boat rides in the lovely seas n lots more. do visit. we wish to go again very soon"
50,“Phuket-The Place to be”,"One of the most amazing experiences of my life was Phuket. To say that I had a wondeful time there would be understating it. Fresh air, beautiful beaches and eye candy. You don't need to think further if you plan to go to Phuket. Pack your bags NOW!!!"
50,“GO there”,"I had heard that Phuket was too touristy and that is wasn't worth going to. I wholeheartedly disagree! It is great, the beaches are some of the most gorgeous in the world. It is worth spending some time there!"
20,“What you should know about Phuket before going there”,"If you like beaches strewn with garbage, overpriced restaurants serving inedible food and being ripped off with expensive tour packages then Phuket is the place for you. Tourism has destroyed Phuket's environment and the environment of the beautiful islands surrounding it. When tourists visit the once stunning tropical isles around Phuket they are more likely to find dozens of beach chairs, at hefty rental prices, garbage and broken coral than untouched stunning beaches. It is a great shame but Phuket is a dump these days."
50,“Merlin Beach Resort”,"We stayed at the Merlin Beach Resort in August 2008. A wonderful time was had by the 4 of us. The resort is very clean, the staff are friendly and helpfull. Loved the swimming pools. Enjoyed the entertaiment at night in the cocktail bar. Will return again, Thank you to the staff of the Merlin Beach Resort."
50,“The Vegetarian Festival”,"Most people come to Phuket for the sea, the beaches and the islands. But if you come to Phuket town during early October, you would have the added bonus of witnessing the amazing Vegetarian Festivals.The festival lasts for 9 days during the frist 9 days of the lunar moon (around late September or early ctober). This is essentially a Taoist festival. Nevertheless, believers or not, everybody joined in to celebrate.The whole town is decoratd with yellow flags and people wear white clothings. Devotees would have their bodies pierced through with metal bars and anything you can imagine. Streets are lined with prayer tables, noticeably in front of big shopping centers or commercial buildings. The main events occur at two temples in town. (Known as the Ban Niao temple).The highlight occurs on the last day when the chariots departs from the temples at night and proceed to the seaside. All along the route, people lined up to witness the procession and throw fire crackers at the chariots and the people carrying the chariots. Looks crazy and sounds deafening. Prepare ear plugs and try not to be in the front row when watching the procession."
40,“JBR”,"Greetings TA readers. We are just back from 10 days in Phuket and 3 days Bangkok - 12th August to 26th August. Unfortunately we left before the airport got closed or we could have stayed longer. Before we went, we read many TA reports and found them in general very useful. This was our 3rd trip to Phuket, the first was 14 years ago and then we went back in September 07 for 10 days staying at the Patong Merlin. Last year we did all the touristy things, Fantasea, Simon Caberet, Elephant Rides, Thai boxing, Golf, boat trips etc etc. All of these are well worth doing and I am sure you will enjoy them, some more than others.This year we were there to relax and re charge the batteries. This year we stayed at the Patong Beach Hotel in a Sunrise wing room which was quiet and close to the pool. I would compare it about the same in standard as the Merlin. There are probably more Aussies stay at the Merlin whereas the Patong Beach Hotel was very multi cultural. It did not bother us either way and I am sure anyone staying at either of these two will be happy enough provided you are not looking for luxury but want something comfortable, reasonably priced and in excellent central locations to Patong.We did organise one tour prior to arriving in Phuket and that was the River Rovers tour. Captain Gordon and his wife Uan run a small boat (like a house boat) out from Ao Chalong and take a slowwww leisurely cruise around the bay and up the river through the mangroves. It was a fantastic day, hosted by a fantastic couple, and with great and plentiful food, cold cold beers and other drinks and best of all, we did not see another tourist all day. We did have some intruders jump the boat at one stage when about 20 wild monkeys came to investigate the banana supply. Capt GORDON had packed the fruit and the monkeys knew they could get an easy feed. Quite an experience. This trip is for those that can handle it slow and easy and if thats you, then I highly recommend it.On another morning, we were waiting for Watsons Pharmacy to open at 9.30am and decided to sit on the corner and watch the world go by. We got talking to one of the drivers named AKE and after a while we decided to book him for a day tour. He is a great little bloke, about 30, and he took us in his Toyota Camry for a tour around the island including Phuket town, Wat Chalong, a few lookout points with a running commentary all the way. Then to a few beaches, a fantastic lunch at a hilltop restaurant with great views and a jewellry shop (at out request). We had him from about 9.30 to 4.00 and the cost was 1500 baht which when you consider it, it is cheap. I gave him a tip and I hope that he can continue to make enough money at that rate to provide the good service that he did. For anyone interested - He can be contacted on I would recommend him but there are heaps of drivers around and I am sure most are pretty good. We also used him to take us to the Phuket town weekend markets and we were there for about 3 hours and he picked us up and took us home. I think he cost about 500 baht for that. The Phuket town markets were hot but thankfully the locals had the foresight to put some bars around. Personally I would not hurry to go back to the market. The OTOP market is better.Our other days were generally spent by hitting the beach after breakfast, hiring the deck chairs at 100 baht each for the day, and relaxing until the afternoon then heading back to the hotel pool for a dip and a couple of bourbons and beers before the huge decision of where to eat. We read many TA reports on places to eat and we kept them in mind but basically we just wandered around until we found something that appealed to us and that was it. A couple of eateries in Soi PATONG RESORT off Bangla Rd were fine, but we really found most of the places we ate were good. I did find a nice liitle bar about fifty metres past the end of Bangla Rd called the Billabong Bar. It has three large screen TV's with sport on and I was able to watch the AFL. An expat Aussie owns the place and there is no hassle from bar girls and he even sells pies and sausage rolls.Before we left, I printed out a TA report from I think Cathy and Gary but Im not sure. It included the approximate prices of clothes, sunglasses and just about everything else. We quite often referred to this before hitting the shops and this was very useful. An example being that when I went to buy a pair of sunglasses, I had a fair idea they would be around 200 baht. The first offer the seller made was for 1200 baht. I ended up paying 180. Unfortunately I only had them two days before I lost them in the surf and had to go back and get another pair -this time 200 baht.After Phuket we had 3 days in Bangkok mainly to do a bit of shopping. We stayed at the Pathuwam Princess and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It is attached to the MBK shopping centre (7 floors) and it was perfect. It is also the closest hotel to the Sky train which we used every day and found it so easy to get around. Apart from shopping we did a river dinner cruise which we booked at the Hotel 12OO bt each. It was a great way to spend the last night of our trip.The only other thing I would say is that after reading lots in the Forums about the 'ugly ozzies' we did not really see too much that bothered us greatly. I have no doubt you may see some people that are loud, and rude and not really the type of people you want around but we generally ignored them and moved on. There were plenty more people, both from Australia and many other countries that we spoke to and found interesting and good company and these are the ones that I would prefer to remember.This will be our last trip to Phuket for a while and we are already in research mode to find our next destination.Anyway thats about it from me, and for those who are about to go, hope you have a wonderful trip.Ian and Mandy"
50,“A place like heaven”,"We spent our honeymoon in Phuket, Thailand last year (2007). We found there more then we have expected. It was a dream that come true. The landscape is like heaven. White sand, palm trees, the sea has a beautiful blue-to-green color, the temples are very unique, the people are very hospitable and they are always smiling.We stayed at Best Western Bang Tao Beach Resort & Spa and we have nothing to object. Everything was perfect there. The staff was friendly and attentive, the hotel has great architecture with two swimming pools and it is situated in a beautiful resort right on the seaside. They have also a spa which offers different types of massage and cosmetic treatments.What is most important in Thailand that is good to know is that everything is cheap and negotiable. You can negotiate even your trip at tourist agency or your food in a restaurant.What someone shouldn’t have to miss is Phang Nga Bay where “James Bond” (1974) was filmed and Phi Phi Island where “The Beach” (with Leonardo di Caprio) was filmed.Enjoy your holiday!"
30,“Beware of what you're getting”,"I lived in Phuket for a year and although it can be very beautiful with some wonderful beaches, this is NOT the paradise island that I am sure some people imagine. Just do your research. Patong is thronging with people and lots of girl bars. There are some quiet and beautiful places around Nai Harn which I think is one of the prettiest beaches on the island. It is a very touristy island and if that's what you like, great. Another side is the sex tourism: if people going on holiday to pick up a young girl/boy half (I'm probably being very generous there) their age is OK with you then it won't be so bad but seeing it does tend to sadden me and some of the girls are questionably young, in my opinion. There are so many beautiful places in Thailand - go to Phuket if you want a touristy beach holiday and you'll love it."
10,“smelly place”,I was in Patong-Phuket not long ago. The sewage ran in open channels and into the sea where tourists were bathing. The place stank.In addition I did not like the cattle market of hundreds of teenage prostitutes screeching at passers-by on the main streets.I was glad to get away from the place.Not my cup of tea.
30,“5 day visit to Phuket Island”,"A quick overview of a 5 day trip .... arriving at Phuket airport - not the best start - filthy bathrooms and no facilities. Moving on, Holiday Inn at Patong Beach (busakorn wing - the best - food, rooms, service) was great place to stay - a haven; stepping out the door of the resort was like into a battlefield .... totes selling tuk tuk, clothing, tailors and other items, no relaxing. Beach packed! Day trip to PhiPhi islands a nightmare with 1,000's of others on every beautiful beach or excellent snorkel location. Departures at Phuket Airport - good facilities and service.HIGHLIGHT - PUM thai Restaurant and Cooking School!"
50,“Luxury Villa In Kata Beach”,"Hi, I just stayed at this awesome villa in Phuket. It was so wonderful I just had to tell you. They have 4 staff so we got pampered like royalty. Its brand new so the furniture was very funky (not all that heavy thai wood) but light modern cool stuff. I found it on www.baansaleah.comI don't have such nice stuff in my own home."
50,“Gorgeous Karon Beach!”,"Gorgeous beach - way better than Patong. No huge crowds. If you need to use the toilet, costs 20 baht at the beach. There are food stalls right along the beach, mostly all thai cuisine - very cheap!Karon beach front markets will pick you up a bargain with knock-off name brand ladies bags (Chloe, D &G, Jimmy Choo etc.) billabong/quicksilver clothing and thai silk items and items alike!All in all, we reccommend Karon Beach and we will definantly be back!"
50,“Lagoon paradise”,"We stayed in the Allamanda Laguna complex from 27/12/07-4/1/08. We stayed in a junior suite facing the lagoon, and it was very clean with a fantastic view. Each day we would use free shuttle bus or free lagoon boat to take us around the hotels and using all of it's complementary services, all of which we very good.The hotels drinks and dinning, were quite expensive, but just outside the complex you had bars, where you could eat and drink very cheaply!The service was very good and the staff were very polite and wellcoming. It was a family orinentated venue, and there could have been a need for a larger bar area in the Allamanda's lobby area.The golf was nearly on the door step, and it was a very good course, with the provision of lady caddies.The wheather was fantastic, although the locals said that this was the rainy season, we didnot see any rain, and it was in its late 20oc- 30oc.The beach area was very nice, although it was pretty quiet ,it would benifit with some more sun loungers and matteresses.Overall a lovely stay, over the xmas and new year period."
10,“The worst holiday of my life”,"If you really do not like someone, buy them a ticket to Phuket!We are completely amazed that people still go there,so we decided to write this brief personal description of what we experienced. Firstly the horrendous drive from the airport ,3/4 hour shuffle through smokey traffic past broken down squalor and filthy villages. A wonderful welcome!The town of Patong and surrounds. Words fail me!A complete cesspool of stinking streets and & filthy abodes with the occasional overpriced high rise ""resort"" dotted about.If you can find a real ""absolute beachfront"" hotel which is within a block or two of the waters edge, then the absurd tarrifs will keep you away. Who is responsible for doling out the star ratings anyway? And from which 3rd world country do they come from?If you are luck enough to live in Australia, then you will quickly discover that 5 stars here equals 2 over there! The so-called ""pristine beaches"" are simply awful, especially compared to ours. The highlight of our trip, was not the endless slopping about in raw sewage or constantly inhaling the stench, but the relentless harrassment from street hawkers or shop owners attempting to flog off poor imitations. Honestly, there was no end to it and we found immense solace in the sanctuary of our overpriced hotel room while we waited ,which seemed to be endless days, before could escape back to the airport.To make a point, avoid it like the plague.If you must go to Thailand, then go to Bangkok. A monstrous bustling city of 12 million of the friendliest folk on earth. The genuine 5 star hotels were less than half the price of Phuket, the restaurants fabulous & the shopping is a fun-filled extravaganza.Or go to Hamilton Isand at half the cost."
50,“Beautiful Southern Thailand”,"There are many places to stay in Phuket. We choose Patang Beach. The main strip is lined with shops galore. Lots of tailor shops to have a dress or suit tailor-made. My boyfriend had a gorgeous lined suit made in less than 2 days for under $100.00 US! Be prepared to bargain with the Thais. They are hard-working and polite people and bargaining with a sense of humor reaps the best results we found.All the hotels and shops are located across the street from the beach. Patong Beach has everything from massages on the beach, approx. $7 US {get one everyday!} colds drinks, fresh fruit, ice cream and souvineers come right to you via the friendly local vendors.Longtail boats will take you to Phi Phi Islands to explore and take in the tranquil beauty that is Southern Thailand."
50,“Karon Small and friendly you will be remenbered Cha Ba Resturant”,Phuket a wonderful location have been there a good few times and would like to go more often. Had been there shortly before the Tsunami and had to go back a few weeks after this awful event. The main purpose of this visit was to show that we cared about the people that we were friends with and to help them recover by encouraging tourists to visit. It was so sad to go back then but was really worthwhile as it was so quiet we really got to know them betterWill be back again this month for a few daysConor
50,“My trip to Phuket”,"Ah, what can I say about Phuket? It is a nice and simple place with simple ppl. Of course sometimes the ppl there will try to sell you those cheap pasar malam t-shirt, which I found out you could get it way cheaper here! To tell the truth, before I went to Phuket I was a little bit scared that the Tsunami would happened again but what the heck!As expected, Phuket is a beautiful place and some ppl said after the tsunami, the beaches are even more stunning. Its a relax place to be. To just leave all your problems behind and just sit on the sandy beaches and just see the world go by. Seafood is a major hit when you go to Thailand so Phuket is no different. Its freaking cheap too! I could just stay there forever and eat nothing but seafood and I don't think I would go sick of it. The only bad thing is that I would have my rashes to no end. I guess the only thing that spoilt my trip was that my seaside hotel room was invaded by a lot of tiny red ants. Don't think that they were tiny they were harmless. I already got rashes from eating way too much seafood so those red ants bitting my bum at night didn't help the situation either. Well, my mum said that was what I got for staying at a budget hotel but the hotel in general was ok. The room, for a budget hotel was far beta than what I got when I stayed at Genting First World Hotel! The only prob was how in the world am I supposed to fight hundreds of tiny red ants? Even the insecticide didn't help. They are like immortal. No matter how many you killed, they just came back to life and mutiply!Would I come back to Phuket again? Yes I would. I would come back because its a place of just peace. Not only to the mind but to the soul as well. Oh yes, I would get to snorkle again and I can't even swim in the first place. So I just did what any insane person would do, and that was just do it and JUMP in! haha!YNWASaz."
50,“the honest truth”,"My partner and i had travelled to bali about 4 times and absolutely love bali, we had been back after the first bombings and had our trip booked however the next bombings went off just a week after we had payed for our holiday and we could not get a refund!! we decided to try somewhere new although a little apprehensive as we loved bali so much.we booked in a trip to phuket & bangkok and it was amazing!! this was our first time so we researched on the net where to stay and decided on the Merlin beach as it was close to patong but at the same time, it was just out of the main street, as when we have stayed in bali we liked to stay just out of kuta in tuban or legian.. however phuket is not flat like bali and instead has hills and mountains and the beaches are more like bays so you can not walk from one beach to the other like in bali!!!! so please note that you do have to get a taxi or hire a bike as we did!!! it isnt far and is basically a 5 min drive up one hill... it just depends if you want to keep paying $5 AUD each way and we would usually go in and out 4 times a day!!!the hotel is great although we are not the type who spends all out time in the hotel as we like to venture out and go to all different beaches, eat at amazing little restaurants we discover and wonder around the streets!!! however the resort is amazing for that quick swim in the afternoon and drink at the pool bar, amazing pools, great service, great breakfast, nice room, but do upgrade to a deluxe as the standard rooms are not pleasant. the beach at the front of the hotel is not good for swimming or sunbaking, nobody uses the beach.. however the rest of the beaches are amazing, i suggest hiring a jeep and driving around to all the beaches.we had previously stayed at santika, ramada bintang, holiday inn and jayakarta in bali and this was most similar to ramada bintang.i have looked at a lot of other hotels and have been all over the island if anyone has any questions or recommendations...in comparison to bali, the beaches are so much better sand is white and water is amazing.... the nightlife is different as it is more bars other than the few clubs in bali, i didnt go to any clubs in phuket so im not sure... but bars are everywhere, the food is better and there is much more diversity and eateries everywhere all on the beachfront like jimbaran bay everywhere!!! shopping is 100x better!!!! the people are maybe not quite as friendly as bali but still nice!!!the only thing we disliked is that if you felt like going for another wonder or going out to get an icecream or something late at night you would have to travel into patong, although not far just inconvenient!!!! otherwise fab!!!"
40,“patong and more”,"my wife and i stayed in patong for 2 weeks in june and found phuket to be an excellent place to visit. its luck of the draw with regards to the weather as its rainy season with us being very fortunate and only really having one day that affected our routine otherwise it was very hot and for the most part sunny,their is plenty of activities to keep you busy with jet skis, banana boat etc down the beach and numerous booths selling tickets for excursions and activities. we done 4 trips one taking in the sites of phi phi island which we thoroughly enjoyed as this area is stunning in natural beauty although the trip did have a packed itenary, secondly we did a elephant trek which was brilliant, being up close to such magnificent animals, its not to be missed, thirdly, i have always fancied game fishing so we joined onto a day trip leaving from chalong bay, weather and trip out was great although the size of the fish caught was well below expectations and that advertised. 4th was ""fantasea"" show / park, the show itself was excellent visually and very entertaining, pre show dinner was a very good buffet but the park itself was a little childish and commercial.patong beach front and other main routes are just a jam packed patchwork of restaurants, bars, shops/traders where you can find good food / drink and plenty of bargains.the downside we found was the street traders, shop/ stall holders, tuk tuk drivers and some restaurants were relentless in trying to get your business with the all in one package suit tailors being by far the worst with some offering a hand as a hello then trying to drag you in their shop.we had a very good time all round and any advice we would give is use plenty sun block, haggle hard, and enjoy yourselves,j & r"
50,“phuket with kids”,"I travelled for 18 days with our family of 5, including 3 kids 11, 14 and 15 to Phuket, Chang Mai and Bangkok and got back yesterday.We had 3 great sunny days then came the rain and after some initial dissapointment wit the rain, we just went with it and decided not to let it ruin our plans and just did everything.Firstly the salespeople can be a bit pushy, but i think they were a little quiet, so we stood out. My kids found it a bit in your face at first but then learnt to not get drawn in too much. We stayed at Karon Beach which was a nice beach, fairly good for swimming, but goes deep fairly quickly. The hotel was good, (The Front Village),service great, nothing too much trouble. Good thing about rain, you do't have to worry about getting burnt.Did one of the best things went to Richard's BBQ. Richard and Megumi, great friendly welcoming people and met nice people, nothing smutty, kids loved it, lots of laughs, great food. I probably wouldn't of gone in a bar off my own back with 3 kids, but so glad we did. Kids loved mini golf, met some other kids. Excellent value.Found the best mini golf ever, looked like something out of Flintstones, complete with dinosaurs, volcanoes, great effects. We went back twice to Dino Golf in Kata BEach. Occ Health and Safety is a bit limited across Thailand, power lines everywhere, no speed limits, but no road rage and i did't see any accidents even though i'm told others did. Must be a nightmare with prams, no decent footpaths.Trips to island, John GRay's Hong Tour, it said 3800baht in brochure, we went to tourist agent, plenty of those everywhere and got it for 2900 and 1300 for 11 year old, but it is worth it expensive price too. Rained so hard, water ws washing under our feet, but didn't spoil the fun. Speed boat tour out to Phi Phi. On stop was at location where the film 'The beach'. About 300m of beach with 2000 people on it, you could see the look of disguest on some people's faces, but it was part of the fun. GReat snorkelling just off that same beach, more rain. Got this trip for half the advertised price. Phi Phi had nice relaxed atmosphere even though very touristy.Fantasea was highly enjoyable even though was totally over top show, the cultural village was really a collection of souvenir shops, though not overpriced really. The foyer into the theatre was lined with elephants and baby tigers you could pay for a photo with, (we didn't). Cost was 1100baht each including hotel pickup, we were told you could get it cheaper. We didn't get the meal, it was 500 baht extra a head.The kids wanted to buy everything, but we kept puting them off until we got to Chang Mai and BAngkok, but not all same things are available in these places. Phuket was good for surf type clothes. Especially bathers, harder to get larger sizes, like me who was a gigantic Aust size 12, ha ha. Even though i was assured it was stretchy and it was good for me, ha ha. The larger sizes are usually up the back.We were close enough to walk into the lower half of Karon near our hotel, but had to catch taxis everywhere else, we usually paid about 150 baht to go to Karon/Kata or Pattong (only went once, but enjoyed it).Something to be careful of, i bought some sunscreen on 2nd day there, TRopic SPF45 plus. My son came out in severe rash, his face swelled up and was red, took 4 days and anti-histamines to clear up. He's never had reaction to anthing in his life. Sunscreeen is probably more expensive than Aust and only available in smaller bottles. AFter that it rained so didn't need anymore sunscreen.I always felt safe everywhere we went in Thailand, i always knew where my kids were though. Phuket is the only place where i saw the old western guys with the young Thai girls and occasionally boys, yuck made me embarassed to be a westerner.Phuket had some great cheap restaurants, we all loved the FRuit shakes. Try Tom and Jerry's in Karon/Kata, its blue and yellow if you come across it, we did eat in the kitchen type places or the food carts, none of us got sick, but we took some acidophillus capsules for the 5 days prior to leaving and for 10 days in then ran out, but they are quite expensive and i couln't find them in Thailand.The dogs look both ways before crossing the streets. They usually have collars on, but just seem to go where they like."
40,“places...”,"Phuket in March is like Myconos Island in Greece in August! Too many tourists, nice beaches and extreme people!!!! Of course Phuket is cheaper, much more cheaper!!!!! You must come and have a taste of this island! Just a sense of real freedom..."
50,“Love it”,My friend and i went to Phuket in May'05 for the first time. It was about 5 months after the Tsunami so everything was still in the process of being rebuilt and was was fairly quiet in the tourism department. But we both had a fabulous time. Phuket is Beautiful and thats why we are coming back this year in Feb'07 and bringing another 2 friends with us. Very excited.
50,“Most relaxing holiday ever!”,"Six of us ( three couples), just returned from an amazing week in Kata Beach, Phuket. We decided to do an all inclusive package with the Katacove yoga villas as it had many activities to choose from that suited all of us.Kata beach is more relaxed than Patong and we were lucky to have a private beach chair area and bar through our villa. Kata noi was also a splendid beach to relax on in the afternoon for sunsets and close walk from our residence.We had a yoga instructor, masseuse, private Thai chef and really friendly maids that made the experience wonderfull.The girls lazed around the pool and beach all day or practised yoga and relaxed with a massage or went sightseeing while the boys played golf on the various courses and did a bit of game fishing and diving.The highlight of the trip for me was the day trip in a speedboat to the Phi Phi islands and the location of ""the Beach"" movie, absolutly beautifull there.I can't wait to go back."
50,“Phuket - Nature personified”,"Before I pen a word, many thanks to tripadvisor for posting plenty of useful tips and reviews about phuket places of visit and hotel reviews. Did find the reviews in here quite handy and so I felt I owe one to tripadvisor site after my visit to Phuket during the week ending September 2006.Must Do/See in Phuket: FantaSea show, phi-phi islands tour, snorkeling or scuba diving, bungy jumping, para sailing, elephant trekking, massage, visit patong beach, phuket town.I happened to choose phulin resort near Karon beach. Its value for money and most appropriate for those who seek a decent accomodation. Although its a 15-20 minute walk from Karon beach - the walk itself would be quite pleasant with a nice and gracious buddhist temple enroute. The staff are quite freindly and warm folks.For those who shun crowded places, Karon beach is a great fun place. U take a dip at the beach out there and walk along the lengthy shores without any disturbance! Patong beach is vibrant and full of life!Do not miss the FantaSea show - its worth every penny u spend on it. For adventure/action lovers - scuba diving/snorkeling is a must. The view below the crystal clear waters is breathtaking - its a completely different colourful world beneath the surface! Even the very ride to ph-phi islands on the speed boat is quite a bumpy one! Check out the para sailing and speed boat stuff - pretty neat ones! Not to forget the bungy jump - its a cool thing to do! of course the white water rafting, elephant trekking etc add to the fun!Go for it - the place is indeed worth a visit!"
50,"“First trip, can't wait to go back!”","Just an opening note from a pair of ""first-timers to Phuket""Not being experienced travellers we (probably me more than my wife) were a little nervous of what to expect & how to handle all the local ways of doing things.At first I was so wary of being ripped off that I must have looked & acted like some wierd character from a Chevy chase movie!It took just one day to realise that we were in a country filled with amazingly gentle people who of course want to make money from the tourists but do it in a far more pleasant way than some of the dealings I have here in Perth with the ""locals""We stayed at the Novatel Patong, on high ground so not affected by the tsunami & about the only minor fault is that the rooms are a lillte dated & the towels could really do with a new batch. The facilities are fabulous & the breakfast choice was fantastic, anyone not happy with the choice, venue or service would have to be very difficult to please.We had a dental appointment in the town on our first day (Sunday) & used a driver arranged by the hotel, James was a really decent, honest & friendly young man (25years old) with a spotlessly clean late model Honda sedan who gave us great value for money (especially after the dentist was closed!) so took us around for 4 hours at a very fair fee. We used him a few times during our stay, he was always spot on time & quite happy to stay with us for as long as we wanted for the one agreed price. We can unconditionally recommend him to anyone needing comfortable transport & wanting some good local knowledge of shoping areas, good eating places & even to book tours. His mobile number is [---].By the way, we rescheduled the dentist who was first class, anyone needing dental work can be assured of excellent service & ridiculously low rates compared to here in Aus. It's Phuket Dental Centre [---].Another must is a massage at Original One in Patong Beach, opp. Patong Towers 108/11 Thaweewong Rd. Superfriendly & incredible value!! Both the dentist & this massage place were recommended off this site & came up AAA! Food wise the choice is huge, we stumbled accross No6. which was consistantly excellent value, we tried a few other places & all delivered big portions of fresh & tasty food, no problems to report other than the day after our Fantasea show ( slightly bizarre but definately worth seeing) & banquet (biggest eating hall ever with enough good food to feed a small country) anyway i think I should have given the 3rd helping of duck (this after dessert) a miss as the day after had me chewing on the tablets & staying in the hotel room for a few hours (self-inflicted food overload consequences!!)Weather was OK, even when overcast or raining it was still around 25C, seas were rough so the beach wasn't particularly appealing but there was plenty of sunshine inbetween to make the most of the beautiful pools in the hotel.We loved Phuket & plan to go back next year, it's fantastic value &what a pleasure to experience a generally well-behaved & tolerant group, even the stray dogs looked friendly & wellbehaved!Highlites: Being there, the people, riding an elephant, Fantasea, the food, cheap clothes, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing.Happy Holidays to anyone on their way to Phuket, wish we were still there!Mike & Benedikte."
50,“Best time ever”,"What an amazing place! From the people to the resorts to the food everything is just fantastic. Well I'll start off with the people who just can't do enough for you, as soon as you walk into a shop or resturant it's instant service with no pressure. At the markets it's a bit different but still all they want to do is help you and have you help them in return. Thai people are pleasent and try their best to understand your language. Just friendly amazing people really.The shopping is cheap and good quality especially considerig the price. We really felt for the people after the Tsunami, you can tell they have lost alot so we didn't bargain them down all the time, we didn't want to feel like we were ripping them off. The shoes are beautiful and the clothes so different and nice compared to what we get over here. The tailors are great I got this beautiful dress made out of Thai silk and it was exactly what i wanted and just lovely for 200 dollars. It might not sound that cheap but a dress like that over in Australia would cost a least 500 dollars and it wouldn't even be tailor made.The food is cheap and to die for. We dine out alot over here and have never had such good, cheap food with fantastic service like you get in Phuket. We ate out of the hotel and in the hotel and the prises in the hotel were still cheap considering the excellent quality and taste. We stayed at the Dusit Laguna and ate at the Italian restaurant the last couple of nights because it was so delicious.The entertainment is great, Simon Cabaret is by far the best place to go if your looking for a great time. Be sure to get there early because the bar out the front has heaps of diffferent cocktails and they are really cheap. If you are the cheeky / adventurous type you must go down the 'casablanca' street and mingle with some of the Lady Boys they are great and some of the best and cheapest restaurants are down there. Phuket fantasy is good to and worth a watch if you haven't seen it before just don't go expecting the show to be all elephants because thats what we were expecting but there was alot of Thai dancing and so on.So all in all it is a beautiful place and i couldn't say enough about it. We went in the end of May when the beach is rough and you can't swim so i can't say alot about th beaches but no matter what the pool at the hotel it gauranteed to make up for it. Well it did for us anyway."
40,“Loved the Gibbons and beaches”,"We have just returned from a wonderful holiday in Phuket, staying, for the first 3 days at Karon Beach and then the rest of the time (14 days) in Kata. The beaches here are lovely, the restaurants very good and some extremely cheap. We can recommend the two restaurants and the southern end of Kata beach. PhuketRichard took us to meet two very cute gibbons, Charley and Lom Yai, somewhere just out of Kata - sorry my sense of direction is not good so I can't say where exactly. This place also had elephants to take you trekking and all the animals are looked after and treated very well. If you contact Richard on this travel forum, I am sure he will tell you how to get there and if you go and see him in Chalong Bay (great place for seafood) he may be able to arrange for you to meet the two gibbons. We spent around 2 hours there with them and it was the highlight of our holiday - they were so cute!My partner and I are looking forward to staying in Phuket again next year and can thoroughly recommend Phuket for a wonderful holiday"
50,“Adventures in Phuket”,"We had an amazing time in Phuket in March 2005. We took a cooking class from a wonderful Thai woman right in her home. The food was delicious! To get a taste of how the locals live we trampled around the local markets and shops of Phuket Town before heading over to the trendy, touristy Patong Beach. The highlight of our vacaton was an excursion to Phang-Nga Bay. The tour included a longboat to James Bond Island, a kayak trip through the bay, lunch at a Muslim fishing village and a visit to Monkey Cave, a temple built right inside a cave! There is a huge reclining Buddha in the cave as well as shrines tucked into the nooks and crannies. Just watch out for the bats! My only regret was that we didn't have more time to enjoy all Puket has to offer."
50,“tsunami Travellers Update”,"As a regular Traveller to Thailand I travelled back to Phuket for a holiday also to access the extent of damage and effects to people travel etc.At Patong beach it is pretty much buisness as `usual. St Patricks Night in Scruffy Murphys was fantastic and the Boathouse on Kata beach up and running and not lost any of its charm, in fact the whole of Phuket has been rejuvinated in the face of adversity. Congratulations Phuket.So make your next trip Phuket. They have survived the Tsunami with pride dont let the survivors down, if you stay away it will create another Tsunami of economic proportion, They need Tourists now.My wife and I stayed at the Cape Panwa and the Boathouse Kata 5 star all the way, Thai Airways are doing great deals from the UK and also internallyPhukets Hotels are also dicounting thro Oct.Regard Joe."
50,“Details of affect of Tsumani on Phuket”,"Ladies and Gentlemen, please don't cancel or re-think your holiday to Thailand if you have booked! I got back yesterday (14/01/05) from Phuket and the south of the island is relatively unaffected. We did get hit pretty badly at Patong and Kamala, but the areas of Karon, Kata, Phuket Town, Chalong Bay and Nai Harn are fine. The clear up was completed within 3-4 days at Karon Beach and even Patong is starting to take shape again! The front of Patong was fairly badly hit and shop fronts are missing, but most of the buildings are intact.Kao Lak is a no-go zone, unfortunately, as this is new resort, it was mobbed out, hence why there were so many deaths there. Kao Lak though, is not on the island, and you'll see none of the devastation that you've seen on the news on Phuket itself.There are no dead bodies floating in the sea, there is no disease, there is running water and everything is normal in the resorts. The only thing missing is the tourists (farangs). Without people going to the resorts, the people will lose their livelyhoods and the areas will no longer be worth going to!If you would like any information on what I've seen, and what the area is like, please email me - louisamaskell@hotmail.com"
10,“Invivibile!”,"Bangla road è sicuramente il posto più ""vivo"" e visitato di Phuket, io personalmente la detesto, troppo chiasso, troppe ""scimmiette"" (prostitute) e lady man (gay e co.)Io ho fatto per gli ultimi 10 anni le mie ferie con la famigliia sempre a Phuket, a cavallo di Natale/capodanno ma quest'anno (2011-2012) tutta l'isola era diventata esattamente come la Bangla Road: ""INVIVIBILE"" !!!Troppo traffico, spiagge troppo affollate 4 FILE DI LETTINI PEGGIO CHE A RIMINI DURANTE FERRAGOSTO, troppi turisti arroganti (in particolare quelli provenienti da una specifica nazione....), nuovi cantieri di costruzione in ogni angolo, ma in una bottiglia da 1 litro ci può stare un litro d'acqua non 10!!A Phuket la pensano diversamente ed orami è rimasto solo solo il dio soldo e a null'altro, che peccato.ADDIO PHUKET!!!"
40,“phuket归来不看海”,PHUKET归来不看海，正如题目一样，PHUKET的海跟青岛的海大相径庭，偶也是从小在海边长大，本以为大海见的多了，不会是什么景观，但是来到PHUKET才知道自己前几十年的海是白看了，这儿的海真蓝，那蓝色仿佛是要沁入到你心底里一样，让你觉得爽，透......
50,“回归自然”,普吉岛好美，天蓝水蓝，海上到处都漂浮着白色的水母，触手可及，但它是有毒的哦，不能碰哦。呵呵。很怀念那里，想有机会再去一次。
40,“sehr touristisch”,"In Phuket ist an jeder Ecke etwas los und es gibt dort für jeden Geschmack etwas gutes.Essen in zahlreichen Lokalen, wobei man in Thailand ja fast überall gut essen gehen kann, egal wie schäbig der Laden aussieht. Die Thais können eben kochen. Zum Shoppen gibt es mehr als genug Angebote, also bloß nicht gleich beim erstbesten zuschlagen.Selbst für einsame Menschen gibt es dort mehr als genügend Angebote für eine ""Begleitung"" am Abend."
30,“普吉岛很不错”,普吉镇上环境很不好，很旧很落后。但海边很漂亮，酒店也不错。定的不是海边酒店，但是被评为10大BOUTIQUE酒店的，很有泰式特色的酒店。
40,“普吉6天4晚游”,空气好，海水清，人也不是很多，就是消费有点高，自费项目也有不少，总体还不错！还去超市买了2袋正宗泰国香米，给了老妈一袋，真得很香，也不贵，每斤5块人民币。
50,“普吉岛”,第一次到普吉岛实在是漂亮极了，这次去的时间太短了，如有时间的话我会去那里多待一段时间的，回来没有几天又有想去的心动了。
40,"“super ""insel""”","die ""insel"" phuket ist vom festland über eine brücke (gar nicht so lange brücke) sehr gut erreichbar.hier ist für jeden etwas los und vor allem ist es das ganze Jahr warm.es wird einen auch nicht fad, da es viel zu unternehmen und anschauen gibt."
50,“休闲天堂”,跟团时间太紧，整体行程很赶，建议自由行，可以先在国内旅行社找好当地地陪。普吉有好多玩的，如果时间有限就挑选最感兴趣的，推荐：1 蓝钻岛浮浅，因为人比较少，水质也很好；2 酒吧一条街，各国人聚集之地，绝对的忘我空间，只是小心钱包和手机；3 小PP岛海边的海鲜烧烤一条街，价格公道，点上一支蒜蓉龙虾再配一杯长岛冰茶，坐在海岸线上听着爵士吹着海风，让人可以忘却一切烦恼；4 一定要享受一下正宗的泰式按摩，再做一做SPA，感觉就跟换了一个人似的；5 美食是必需的，让地陪带着上街去自己买当地的小吃，感受下人文风情；6 水果不用我说你们也会吃到HI的
20,“Touristenabzocke”,"Phuket ist teuer, teuer, teuer.Taxifahren fast nicht mehr zu bezahlen.Schmutzig, übervoll und absolut übel.Die schlimmste Insel in ganz Thailand.Nur bedacht darauf, den Touristen das Geld zu entllocken und keine Gegenleistung dafür zu bieten.Thailand hat schönere Inseln und Städte zu bieten.Auf Phuket leben fast keine Thais mehr. Das sagt schon alles."
50,“美丽的普吉岛”,"泰国一颗璀璨的明珠，吹着海风，享受着阳光的沐浴，呼吸着大海的味道,看着海里的小鱼游来游去，还有比这更美的吗？从未有过的放松自在。"
50,“舒适且奢华的住宿，放松身心的娱乐项目”,在普及机场下了飞机，大约车程2个小时到达博森山庄，独栋的泳池别墅房型，放松或者养精蓄锐的好场所。而且，我最喜欢的是，山庄里有很多经典景区，游乐设施和运动项目，睡到了自然醒，可以去湖中垂钓，不知名的白色花瓣飘落在湖中，让人神往。迷你高尔夫，自助骑行，绿荫足球场，让我们尽情挥洒着青春的汗水，走累了，山庄中专门的敞篷电车可以载着直接到达别墅区。哈哈，一切都很美好，而且都是免费的哦！去的时候，记得带墨镜，因为可能会有些晒的。
50,“美丽的情人沙滩”,第一次到微笑国度，第一个景点情人沙滩~~真是传说中的婴儿奶粉般的沙滩，美丽死了，美丽的沙滩，美丽的海。白嫩的沙滩，碧蓝清澈的海水，国内绝对绝迹！！还要去！！！图片怎么上传不了啊，加了图片就点评不了
50,“难忘普吉岛”,在普吉岛6天每天都是过的悠闲自在，蓝天白云软软的沙滩心情不由自主的变得舒畅自由忘记现实。普吉岛今生定要重返一次！
40,“声色犬马”,白天，阳光，沙滩，比基尼女郎。晚上，霓虹灯不停闪耀，泰国妹妹不停向你问好。就是要不停喝酒，不停喝。放声大笑，也没有人给你鄙夷。这里是释放灵魂的好地方。住在巴东海滩附近，不过建议住在Holiday Inn resort因为离海滩近，而且游泳池和酒吧很漂亮。外国人很多很多，有家庭团，老年夫妇，年轻的情侣和单身人士。反正是各有各精彩。
50,“posto stupendo!”,isola stupenda! piena di vita e possibilita' di bellissime escursioni.
40,“復興してまたアジアビーチの代表に”,津波の避難表示がある以外はすっかり元に戻っていて活気があります。人気のパトンビーチのビーチベッドの数は迫力があります。海も綺麗でこの辺りは魚は少ないですが、島に行けばたくさんいますし、グルメにマッサージと楽しみはたくさんあります。物価が高い事には驚きました。
30,“Den Erwartungen nicht entsprechend”,"Die Insel bietet viele Straende, aber es ist schwer einen ruhigen Strand zu finden. Am besten hat uns Surin Beach gefallen.Dieser hat kristallklares Wasser, ist aber sehr voll und schon sehr vermarktet: Liegen zum mieten, Massagen, Gastronomie,etc. Als wir ankammen, fielen die Haendler ueber uns her wie die Geier. Die verlangten Geld, zuerst haben wir nicht verstanden wofuer: Eintritt zum Strand? Parkgebuehr? Liegen? Die anderen Straende sind auch voll, zu dem noch dreckig und das Wasser ist meistens trueb."
30,“Ueberfuehllt”,"Die Insel Phuket ist keine besonders schoene Insel. Die oeffentliche Buesse gibt es so gut wie gar nicht. Man hat uns gesagt, die wurden abgeschafr, damit die einheimischen Taxifahrer mehr verdienen koennen. Die Taxipreise sind Wucherpreise. Z.B. Airport- Kamala Beach 700Bath, dagegen vom Pier zum Airport 500 Bath, dabei die Entfernung ist doppelt so lang.Die Straende sind hoffnungslos ueberlaufen, wir haben kein einziger ruhigen Strand gefunden. Ausserdem das Wasser ist fast ueberall trueb, die Straende verschmutzt.Wir haben eine Sonnenbrille""die bessere Qualitaet"" fuer 250 Bath gekauft, als einige Tage spaeter die kaputtgegangen ist, der Verkaeuferin hat geweigert sie umzutauschen oder zu reparieren. Wir sollen zur Polizei gehen, Was wir nicht getan haben, da was dabei rauskommen wuerde, weiss jeder."
50,“I love phuket”,蓝天白云 椰林树影 水清沙白 热情的泰国人 甜美的鸡蛋花 色彩斑斓的热带水果 悠闲慵懒的生活节奏 真想留在普吉 做个时间的囚徒
50,“普吉岛，有着很美丽海的地方”,普吉岛的海很蓝，听说只有天很蓝的时候，海才会很蓝，普吉岛有很多个小的岛屿，每一个都很浪漫，岛上有很多美丽的房子和景色，很适合情人们去度假，泰国的人很热情，水果的品质很好，又大又甜，还很新鲜，饭菜也很有特色，便利店都是24小时营业的，有好看的人妖表演，如果可以，还会再去！
20,“phuket a bien changé”,"j'ai connu Phuket il y a quelques années et c'était franchement un endroit idéal.. des jolies plages, des visites interressantes à faire sur l'ile et aux alentours .. ça n'a pas changé mais ce qui a radicalement changé c'est l'ambiance générale sur patong notamment .. autant il y a encore 3 ans les gens étaient accueillant, très souriants ( la Thailande est quand même le pays du sourire...) polis et charmants .. autant cette année en 2010 j'ai senti une nette différence ... de plus en plus de gens font la [...] ( je parle des thais là ) de plus en plus sont peu aimables surtout dans les boutiques .. il devient courant qu'on vous dise ni bonjour ni merci ni au revoir ..la tentative de ""petite arnaque au quotidien"" est devenue régulière : arnaque sur les prix, sur les prestations, sur la monnaie rendue, sur les locations etc.. à chaque fois c'est rien de bien méchant mais ça dénote un début de quelque chose qui va pas ... faut dire que l'ile est envahie par une clientèle russe et là franchement désolé pour ceux que ça va choquer mais alors la majorité d'entre eux se comportent comme des grossiers, et sans éducations. ils parlent fort partout où ils sont, se balladent torse nu dans les centres commerciaux, ne savent pas dire merci ou bonjour. j'en ai meme vu qui pour payer quelque chose jetaient l'argent sur la table comme on jeterait un morceau de viande à un chien .. en voyant ça on comprend aussi pourquoi les Thais d'habitude si adorables deviennent agressifs et peu aimables ...Quelle tristesse de voir ce petit coin de rêve changer dans un si mauvais sens . Espérons pour les Thais et pour ceux qui apprécient la thailande et ses charmes que ces grossiers changeront soit d'attitude soit de destination...."
20,“phuket”,"bonjourj'étais à phuket 10 jours en décembre.je voulais dire toute ma déception par rapport à cet endroit.J'étais à KATA, soit disant une des plus belles plages. J'étais au kata orient house.je ne conseille pas le kata orient house où alors juste une nuit pour trouver autre chose ... propriétaire mal-aimable (repris par une thai)l'endroit : phuket en général --> aucun charme, une circulation IMPOSSIBLE : ile traversée par une 4 voies.Quelques endroits plus charmants et où il y a moins de monde : au sud, village de pecheurs.Mais sinon aucun intéret : la plage de KATA est assez propre mais rien de fabuleuxLa circulation dans l'ile : très dangereuse en scooter. On a eu un accident. Heureusement que le scooter était loué par un européen qui ne réclamait pas le passeport comme monnaie d'échangesinon c'est la dictature des tuk tuk qui opèrent à un prix exhorbitant pour faire 3 km : la vraie mafiabref, aucun intéret pour phuket où nous sommes vraiment considérés comme des euros sur pattes.une clientèle de touristes exclusivement russe. vive phuket-vodka !A FUIR !choisir une ile du style koh phi phi ou plus calme mais surtout pas phuketen tout cas merci à tous les gens du forum qui m'ont aidé à préparer mon voyageje voulais juste faire ce message pour dire aux gens que phuket, ce n'est vraiment pas la thailande !"
50,“Den store Budda i Phuket”,En veldig bra tur med fin utsikt over hele Phuket er og anbefale til alle som reiser til Phuket.
50,“不去真的会后悔的地方”,我是2010年8月去的普吉、3小时多点就到了还挺快的、本来以为那边应该比重庆还热、结果后来发现温度还好啦、只不过一定要擦防晒霜和打伞、紫外线很强哦、我们在群岛上旅行了2、3天都是包的一艘艇、很方便、想去哪就去哪、还有就是极其推荐PP岛、很浪漫随性、到处都是白人、在PP岛上一下就觉得没有压力、酒店真的都很棒、基本上酒店都自带海滩、就是说你在酒店走几步就可以下海！真的很不错、我以后还会再去、在PP岛上住上1、2个月、还有那边的人都会简单的中文、英文也会点、所以也不用担心
50,“蓝天，碧海，阳光，沙滩，花香，鸟语，虫鸣。。。。”,一个很值得去的地方，普吉岛消费不高，从北京过去，随团的话，也就5000左右，当然这里面不包括你自己的购物，最适合去的季节是11月到4月份。那里华人很多，很多人都会说汉语。当初去的时候以为很多人说英语呢，结果我说英语，他们都听不懂。所以交流起来不会游太大的障碍。享受阳光，海浪，沙滩，。。。。。。去的时候一定要带好防晒霜。因为温度很高。还有，泰国菜个人认为口味偏淡，所以口味偏咸的同志们一定要早做好准备哈。
40,“Schöne Insel aber ziemlich überlaufen mit Touristen”,"Phuket ist eine schöne Insel in Thailand, jedoch mittlerweile schon ziemlich überlaufen mit Touristen.Wir hatten uns einen Roller gemietet und sind zu einsamen Stränden gefahren.Die Strände sind dort echt super super schön.Der Hauptstrand von Phuket hat uns leider nicht so gefallen.Das Essen ist natürlich super lecker und billig."
50,“Maravillosa ciudad!”,"Luego de una ola fria de Europa, decidí animarme e ir sola Tailandia....si sóla, es un lugar muy seguro para los que deciden viajar solos.Estuve tres días en Bangok y 7 en phuket.Es increible lo barato que es, no conviene contratar el hotel desde tu país, sino cuando estés alla. Tampoco las excursiones, incluso la podés regatear según la cantidad que contrates.En Bangok fui a varios Palacios y a un mercado flotante que me encanto.En Phuket me la pasé todos los días de excursión: Fui a Phi Phi island (lugar que se filmó la playa), similan island...También hay mucha noche, discotecas...hay para todos los gustosLo unico cansador, es que te la tenés que pasar regateando todo el tiempo, pero para comprar cosas es baratisimo.Cualquier inquietud no duden en escribirme"
40,“梦幻的情人沙滩”,很早之前就看过莱昂纳多所主演的《The Beaches》，看见那美丽的沙滩，还有那清澈的海水，自己已经早早的陶醉在这画面里面了，后来知道了这电影的拍摄地点就是普吉岛后，下定决心一定要去~嘻嘻~美梦成真，自己也陶醉在这美景里面了~
50,“マリンスポーツ”,マリンスポーツの価格が安く、種類も豊富！お薦めはパラセイリング。空高くふあっと上がる感覚は最高です♪テーマパークはおすすめしません。価格の割りに見るところがなく、時間の無駄でした。
50,“癒しのリゾート！”,香港経由でタイ・プーケットへ行ってきました。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　休暇を利用し、久しぶりにマリンリゾートでのんびりと過ごしました。　　　バトンビーチは、ヨーロッパからの観光客が多く、賑わっていました。プーケットは海産物が豊富で、夕食は私の好物の「カキ」「ロブスター」などを美味しく食べることができました。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　また夜には、プーケット ファンタシーへ行き、タイの優雅さとエキゾチックなその歴史、異国情緒あふれる美しさと魅力を感じることができ、数多 くの国の料理を食べることもできました。さらにイブニングショーでは、最先端のテクノロジーと特殊効果を駆使した豪華なショーをお楽しむことができました。
30,“Ferieninsel mit viel Tourismus und Regen”,"Obwohl im November hier eigentlich die Hochsaison beginnt haben wir in den vergangenen 2 Wochen die Sonne noch nicht gesehen. Viel Regen und extreme Luftfeuchtigkeit mindern das Urlaubsvergnügen doch sehr.Dafür gibt es immer noch die leckere Thai-Küche, Tauchen und anderer Wassersport ist recht billig und das Nachtleben sowieso legendär."
50,“智者乐水”,仁者乐山、智者乐水。不过智者又有安逸喜静、和活泼好动之分。比较来看，九寨沟的水中看不中玩，适于前者；普吉的水中看又中玩，后者相宜。
30,“Phuket-was für Partytouristen”,"Fortsetzung unserer Thailand-Rundreise-haten wir 3tage stopp in Phuket, wobei ich sagen muss, es war auf jedenfall interresant Phuket mal zu sehen, aber ich muss nicht unbedingt ein 2tes mal hinfliegen, kann für ""badeurlauber"" empfehlen Koh Chang oder Koh Samet, ist ruhiger und hat schönere Strände und auf ganz klar günstiger als Phuket, zum Nachleben ich habs mal gesehen,aber zum teil sehr aufdringlich und zum teil total überteuert für Thailand-Verhälltnisse,essen wir überall in Thailand spitze.fazit, Phuket perfekt für junge Leute die Party machen wollen, aber auch gleichzeitig baden wollen, bzw etwas Thai-Kultur sehen wollen, zb Buddistische Tempel"
40,“viele möglichkeiten in phuket”,"ich kenne die insel phuket seit ca.30 jahren.in den anfangszeiten war die insel ein wirkliches juwel.der tourismus hat natürlich in den jahren seine spuren hinterlassen,aber wer nicht nur auf sex und alkohol aus ist, hat immer noch die möglichkeit, schöne ruhigere strände und buchten zu finden.der touristenhauptort ist patong.hier gibt es nichts,was es nicht gibt!leider auch an gewissen stellen,besonders abends und nachts sehrhektisch und laut.aber 50 meter weiter dafür recht angenehm.auch hier sind die preise natürlich gestiegen,jedoch immer noch günstiger als in europa."
30,“声色普吉”,有些嘈杂 但很热闹 声色普吉有它妩媚的一面傍晚去巴东海滩去看看日落 来灌啤酒 很是惬意当然已不见那比基尼的姑娘
30,“Phuket: Für einen Badeurlaub ok”,"Phuket ist für einen Badeurlaub ok. Die Strände sind zwar tropisch, jedoch nicht so schön wie in der Karibik. Allerdings kann man von Phuket aus sehr gute Ausflüge nach Kho Phi Phi sowie zur James Bond Island unternehmen."
50,“好喜欢”,真的好喜欢普吉岛的海水！虽然我也是生活在海边--青岛。但第一次到普吉岛，第一次看到普吉岛的海滩，真的让我感到惊奇。大小PP岛、桃花岛等，都很不错。另外，海边喂鱼的感觉也很爽。呵呵……建议大家去！
50,“梦回普吉”,爱上那里的一切！美丽、慵懒的日子……非常纯净的海水，大小PP岛屿，大群的密集的小鱼，在安达曼海上看印度洋的落日，在芭东海滩和各国友人的狂欢……
50,“Bester Urlaub meines Lebens”,"1 Woche Thailand - ein Traum. Phuket ist eines meiner Lieblingsziele. Wir hatten ein super Hotel direkt am Nai Harn Beach und das Wetter war super. Es gibt so viel, was man tun kann: Einfach mal am Strand liegen, ein Moped für kleines Geld mieten und damit die Insel erkunden, einen Ausflug machen und auf Elefanten reiten, Quatt fahren, River-Rafting, Schnorcheln und viel viel mehr. Auf jeden Fall sollte man sich mindestens 2 Wochen Zeit für die Insel nehmen. Es ist Abenteuer pur und ich freue mich schon auf mein nächstes mal dort, dann gehts zum Patong Beach."
40,“普吉岛”,酒店很好，东西便宜。食物很好，便宜。风景优美，海水清澈。服务很好。能浮浅游泳。spa很好，是旅游的好地方。价廉物美，性价比很好，值得一去。
40,“Phuket”,"Nicht etwa die Seite von Patong ist nett, nein genau die andere Seite. Nai Harn Beach ist sehr schön und im Gegensatz zum Rest der Insel ruhig. Der Strand traumhaft und sauber. Zwar stehen auf einer Seite die Liegen des Yacht Club Hotels aber das stört nicht weiter.Mehr im inneren des Ortes findet man Bars, Cafes und Partyorte. Allerdings hält es sich hier stark in Grenzen. Leider hat sich auch in Nai Harn viel verändert. Habe selber hier mein Kind geboren und 6 Jahre hier gelebt. Als ich dann nach etwa 10 Jahren wieder kam wußte ich erst nicht ob ich mich noch an der richtigen Stelle befinde. Das Wachstum ist rasend schnell, alles verändert sich im Handumdrehen. Trotzdem, Nai Harn kann ich nur weiter empfehlen und es ist zwar eine "" Reise"" nach Patong wert, nur wohnen würde ich da nicht. Die Preise sind teilw. 5x so hoch wie in Bangkok.........Das Essen in Nai Harn- also ganz so multi Kulti wie auf der anderen Seite der Insel ist es nicht, einen Mexikaner- und der ist gut, Italiener, eine Bäckerei und gutes Thaiessen sind vorhanden.Wer selber kocht bekommt das meiste umliegend und frisch.Alle Strassenstände sind zu empfehlen. Das Essen ist immer frisch und sauber. Weder ich noch mein Mann oder die Kinder hatten jemals Probleme.Nur nicht das Wasser aus der Leitung. Trinkwasser immer im Laden kaufen.Viel Spaß in Phuket!!!!!"
50,“可爱的海岛城市”,有非常美的海滩，虽然人有点多，有很多游玩项目，即使是在海边漫步，感受着海浪的冲击也是非常惬意的事情，海是三色的，好美的海。普吉的人们真的很友好，从接送我们的司机，那晚迷路时遇到的好心的人妖，卖纪念品的店老板，还有帮我们选海鲜的店员，都是热心和彬彬有礼的。真是还想再去一次啊。
40,“プーケット一にぎやかな場所ですね。”,タイに良く行く私ですが、プーケットに来たときはパトンに必ず行きます。にぎやっていますしね。しかも暑い！人も熱い（笑）私は、プーケットパトンビーチの南のほう（ちょっと離れているかも）にあるパンヤーレストランが好きです。軽トラを改造したトゥクトゥクで行きましたよ～眺めも良くて料理も良くて雰囲気を重視する方には良いかも。たくさんのトゥクトゥクがあり、しかもどれも個性的で乗りたいけど、値段が高くてあまり乗りませんでした。パトンビーチにはたくさんのホテルがあります。安価なところから高いところまで・・・予算に合わせていろいろ選べますね。タイの中でもプーケットは物価高いですね。初めて行った時は分からないですが、バンコクや他の地域と比べても高いです。なので、私はタクシーでBigCまで行ってたくさんお買い物をして来ます。プーケットには数箇所ビーチがありますが、にぎやかさを求めるには良いと思います！
50,“非常适合自助游”,非常适合休闲游，时间好像一下子停驻了，所有匆忙的感觉都消失不见。榴莲、山竹热带水果很便宜很新鲜；住的也很舒服，每天记得给小费，服务员会多送一瓶水。只是比较潮湿，夏天蚊虫很多，防晒霜、防蚊露是必备品。海水很干净清澈，感慨当地的环保做的相当好，小鱼就在水边嬉戏。连不会游泳的人都能找到适合的水上娱乐，比如海底漫步。非常值得一去，适合一家大小。SPA女生一定要试试，非常喜欢香蕉味的沐浴露。
50,“L'Isola di Phuket e le sue mille sfaccettature”,"Phuket si trova nel Mar delle Andamane, nella costa occidentale della Thailandia. Scoperta negli anni Settanta da viaggiatori in cerca di luoghi incontaminati, con il tempo è divenuta una delle mete più battute dal turismo di massa. Nonostante questo Phuket, è la più grande isola della Thailandia, conserva posti esclusivi e suggestivi, nascoste alle guide turistiche tradizionali, ma che potrete trovare attraverso un network di informazioni dalla rete. Phuket, un' isola di contrasti: Phuket ha molto da offrire ai suoi visitatori, purtroppo molti si fermano alle spiagge e alla chiassosissima Patong Beach.Le spiagge di sabbia bianca abbondano sulla costa occidentale mentre le mangrovie segnano la costa orientale. Una serie di colline da nord a sud la divide in due parti. Spumeggianti cascate, specialmente nella stagione umida, ne segnano i fianchi. Vista da lontano,Phuket si protrae nel mare Andamano, aspettando di essere esplorata e vissuta, per questo la nostra guida ha trovato la simpatia di tanti viaggiatori negli anni .Tante le Guest House che offrono un servizio eccellente senza spendere una fortuna"
50,“成熟旅游城市、设施完备”,很多资深驴友可能对普吉不太感冒，觉得这里太大众化，不能彰显自己的独特品味。可惜我去过泰国的几个岛屿来看，还是普吉最为成熟、设施最为完备。而普吉的市民也是最友好的。1、普吉市区backpack hostel众多、餐饮pub遍地、shopping mall的水准也非常高甚至超越曼谷。2、普吉周边的几个景点，日落崖、batong、kamala等近在咫尺，租个摩托车半小时内抵达。这些地方游客略多，不过服务也更齐全，适合一家老小过来玩。3、普吉交通方便，航班密集，折扣较多。4、普吉去phi phi、去krabi等地都非常方便，游轮比较多。5、要单独拿出来说，普吉附近的racha岛简直就是人间天堂！请大家看图。（太可惜了，daodao只能贴两张，完全不能显示其美丽啊）
30,“caotica e vivace”,"Phuket è un'isola caotica ed estremamente vivace!Sole,mare cristallino, spiaggia, divertimento e vita notturna: ecco phuket! Se avete in mente vacanze tranquille e rilassanti, allora è meglio optare per mete differenti.Il primo impatto con Phuket può essere un po' travolgente: macchine, tuk tuk impazziti e tanta gente; ma basta ambientarsi un po', rinfrescarsi con una doccia e poi dare inizio alla propria vacanza!Anzitutto, esiste la possibilità di prenotare un'infinità di escursioni nelle località vicine all'isola, gite di intere giornate o anche solo di qualche ora. Potete prenotare anche qualche ora prima di partire, poichè molto spesso non tutti i posti vengono prenotati, e chi lavora per le agenzie locali sarà ben lieto di aiutarvi nell'organizzare un piacevole pomeriggio all'ultimo minuto a prezzi stracciati e soprattutto VALE LA PENA, visiterete posti incredibilmente belli.Altrimenti Phuket ha molto da offrire per chi cerca semplicemente calde giornate in spiaggia e di tanto in tanto qualche distrazione come sport acquatici o shopping tra le bancarelle.Per quanto riguarda il cibo,consiglio di provare uno dei tanti ristorantini sul lungomare: molti di questi espongono quotidianamente il pesce fresco appena pescato in apposite bancarelle. E' possibile comprare pesce al kg e farlo cucinare direttamente secondo i propri gusti. Chi ama il pesce non si stancherà di mangiare fino alla nausea!!!!Per pochi Bat si possono infatti comprare pesci, crostacei (aragoste,granchi) e molto altro!Bene ,se il vostro fine è quello di concedervi una vacanza movimentata e vivace,allora Phuket fa per voi!"
40,“ベストシーズンのプーケット”,１月から２月にかけてがプーケット西海岸のベストシーズンです。海は凪ぎ、雨は殆ど降らず、湿度もほど良く快適に過ごせます。５泊７日の滞在中、にわか雨に降られることもなく、毎日晴天に恵まれ、海の美しさを存分に堪能することができました。
40,“泰国普吉岛4晚跟团行，沙滩、碧水、蓝天”,第一次出国，选择了泰国，无非因为价格便宜，签证方便，我们是过年的时候出发的，杭州这边严冬，快到泰国的时候，衣服一件一件的外外脱，最后只剩件短袖，还要涂抹一大堆的防晒油，这个感觉真不错，气候差异原来可以这么大。泰国给我的印象：热带、水真的很蓝很清澈、天空也很蓝、心情也很舒畅，值得一游的地方。发几张照片大家欣赏欣赏。。。
50,“Der Ort ist sehr Empfehlenswert über und...”,Der Ort ist sehr Empfehlenswert über und unter Wasser.
40,“普吉岛度假”,普吉岛是个非常成熟 便利 交通发达 购物方便的度假胜地。这里非常适合自由行与朋友 家人一起愉快的度假非常好的选择。普吉岛周围还有一群小岛 适合一日游去浮浅，感受小岛的乐趣 或有多余时间在PP岛 皇帝岛等住上几天也是不错的选择。
50,“青い海”,ヨーロッパ系白人の方々が大変多く，特に島の南北のビーチは日本人の方を全く見かけませんでした．アジアのビーチとしては珍しいのではないかと思いますし，ぜひアクティブに動き回って，いろいろなビーチで遊んでみてください．本当のビーチはそんなに透明度がないけれど，手軽です．透明度を求めるのなら，ぜひ離島へ．夜の遊び場も充実していて，ご飯も日本に比べたら格段に安いので，また行きたいです．
50,“スパ・ビーチでのんびりと！”,新婚旅行でタヒチ、モルディブと迷いましたが予算的にプーケットにしました。初のプーケットでしたが、とても気に入りました。思ったより広いので移動には車が必要ですがホテルのビーチでのんびりと過ごすのも良いかと思います。プーケットファンタシーは一見の価値があります。スパも多く心身ともにリラックスができます。おすすめは「カナシアスパ」！結構安くリフレッシュできます。ショッピングは「セントラル」がお勧め。大型モールですが、タイ土産も安く買うことができます。ビーチでのんびり派には近くのコーラル島がお勧めです。射撃もぜひ行っていただきたいです。また行きたい場所です。
50,“大好きプーケット！女の子なら行くべし！”,ＨＩＳの格安旅行で三月に行きました。最低でも３泊５日あると、楽しめます！！！宿泊ホテルから繁華街までは、距離があったのですが、何処にでもタクシーやトゥクトゥクを利用していけるので、便利だし、お値打ちです。地元の屋台も美味しく、かなりのお値打ち！！日本の三分の一くらいです。タイ料理に飽きても、さすがリゾート地！ハンバーガー、洋食、和食、何でもあります。とにかく海は綺麗です。パトンビーチは混み合っていますが、カタビーチやカロンビーチまで行けば、人も少なくリゾート気分満喫です。マッサージも街角のマッサージ屋さんでも充分、お値打ち（２０００円くらい）で、リラックスできます。でも、せっかくなので、高級スパも行って来ました。スコーカルチュラルスパに行きましたが、日本語も通じ、雰囲気も素敵でした。スパやダイビング、象のり、プーケットファンタシーなど前もってネットで予約することをオススメします。安くなるし、次の予定があればそこまでの送迎などの打ち合わせもでき、無駄なタクシー代を使わずに済みます。ダイビングショップは、ほうぼう屋さんを利用させていただきました。日本人スタッフで安心です。ピピ島には、高速船を使用してくれるので、４０分くらいで着き、疲れませんでした。ランチもバイキングで美味しかったです。帰りが遅くなってしまい、オプションの送迎に間に合わなかったのですが、ほうぼう屋さんのスタッフが送ってくれるなど、とても親切にしていただきました。大型連休を除けば、日本人にも会いません。何度でも行きたいです！！！
40,“観光地化されたビーチリゾート”,パトンビーチを中心に観光地として開発されたビーチリゾートです。パトンの周辺は、ナイトライフが満喫できる施設も整っています。反対にパトンから離れたビーチでは、比較的静かな夜が楽しめますが、タイのほかのビーチリゾートに比べると、どこもよく開発されているので、不便は感じないと思います。マイナス点としては、観光地なので、ホテルを含め全ての物価が高い。在地のタイ人も観光客相手なので、スレた人が多いです。
20,"“carina, ma taxi carissimi e mare agitato”","Segnalo il prezzo notevolmente caro dei taxi( diversamente da Bangkok), consiglio pertanto a chi può, di fittarsi una macchina o un motorino. Kata beach è tranquilla, adatto un pò a tutti, anche alle famiglie, non c'è però una grande vita notturna. La spiaggia è ampia ed è ben tenuta , ma è da rilevare la presenza del mare mosso, con notevoli onde e cavalloni. La sconsiglio a chi cerca il mare come una tavola piatta....!"
50,“Trattoria la casereccia Patong Phuket”,Ho trascorso dei giorni bellissimi in thailandia precisamente a Phuket e vi dirò ritornerò al più presto lìc'e nè per tutti i gusti il mare è bello la gente è accogliente e il divertimento è assicurato veramente per tutti chiunque tu sia e qualsiasi gusto tu abbia!!!poi per completare il tutto devo dire ci sono decine di ristoranti Italiani vi dirò francamente molti lasciano a desiderare perchè non hanno nemmeno i cuochi Italiani immagginate un pò che vi propongono!!!ne ho trovati un paio che sono italiani nel vero senzo della parola ma quello dove mi sono recato spesso è la Trattoria la Casereccia dove ho trovato una bella accoglienza e disponibilità e soprattutto ho mangiato veramente bene mi sembrava di stare in Italia e ho scoperto con piacere ma lo immagginavo che a cucinare c'era un italiano doc e al momento del conto sono rimasto contentissimo perchè non era per nulla salato in italia mi sarei mangiato una pizza e una birra forse!! lì ho fato una cena completa e ho speso 15 euro insomma sentite a me tutto fatto in casa e buono ne vale la pena.non è centralissimo ma all angolo di Nanai road con Soi Tan facile!!!!
50,“Phuket bästa båtresa”,"Vi har varit ute med La Moet i Phuket 2 år i rad på deras två dagars tur!Detta är den absolut bästa utflykt vi varit på,vi fick se de finaste öarna, bada från bästa stränderna, segla bland klipporna och en övernattning på Raylay beach!Vilda apor, stora jätte ödlor, och fiskar i alla färger!Allt från organisation till mat - helt fantastiskt!Sen pricken över är guiden Tess, en enastående kvinna som får alla ombord att bara trivas och slappna av.Ni ska inte missa denna utflykten! Helt suveränt!Jessika"
50,“ダイビングライセンス取得”,島全体がリゾートアイランドです。カロンビーチとカタビーチには白人旅行者が多く、日本にはない本物のバカンスをしにリゾートに来ているんだなと思わせてくれます。カロンビーチの白砂のビーチは一見の価値ありです。裸足で砂を踏むとキュッキュッと鳴きます。私は6日間、プーケットのカタビーチに滞在し、日本人の経営するダイビングショップ’（ほうぼう屋さん）でダイビングのライセンスを取得しました。半日の学科と半日のプール講習、2日間で4ボートダイブでラチャヤイ島に行きました。全部でで費用は日本円で2万5千円で日本でライセンスを取得するより簡単で、安く取得できました。水中の世界はとっても感動的ですよ！！夜はプーケットファンタシーやナイトクラブなど、本当に飽きません。島の治安もよく物価も安いので、久しぶりの魂の洗濯になりました。
40,“また必ず訪れたい”,2008年6月に行きました。休暇の旅先を決めるのに色々な旅行サイトや個人の方のブログを見ていて、津波後のプーケットについて書いてあるものを読みました。そこに書かれていたのは、「被災地に遊びに行くのは不謹慎だと思われがちだけれども、被災後の観光復興こそ地元の人の役に立つ。実際に日本人観光客が激減しているので、もっと来て欲しい。」という一文。その言葉に後押しされるようにプーケット行きを決めました。実際に訪れてみると、街は綺麗に再建されており、災害のあとなども感じられません。ここまで復興されるのは大変なことだったと思いますが、おかげさまで素晴らしい休暇を過ごすことができました。南国特有ののんびりした時間の流れ、賑やかなパトンの通り、カロンの綺麗な砂浜、何を食べても美味しくビールも旨い。そして何より、ホテルやレストラン、街中の商店の人達のフレンドリーで温かいもてなしが最高でした。また近いうちに必ず訪れたい場所です。
40,“常夏の楽園”,とにかく太陽がまぶしい島です。観光地化が進み、旅行者には不便なことはあまりありません。たいていの場所では英語が通じ、場所によっては日本語を話す現地人もいます。島には美しい自然、夜までにぎわうダウンタウン、ゴルフコース、ダイビングスポット、様々なタイプのビーチなど自分のスタイルに合わせて過ごすことができます。もちろん、マッサージやバーなどは現地プライスですから、驚きの安さも魅力です。映画、ザ・ビーチの舞台にもなった、とっても美しい海、ピピ島への出発地もここプーケットです。
50,“微笑みの国　タイ”,タイへは、彼氏と２人で旅行へ行きました。プーケットへは、２００６年に行きましたが、その２年前の２００４年に津波が発生しました。その影響で、場所によっては、店が半分くらい閉店している所もありました。山を原付バイクで登った際、たくさんの花があり、気にしながら走っていると、津波がきた場所の印がありましたが、そこは山の中腹。かなり大きな津波にビックリし、とても怖くなりました。そんな出来事があったにも関わらず、現地の人はとても愛想がよく、穏やかな時間を過ごすことが出来ました。私が行った１０月は、タイの祝日（？）だったらしく、町でお祭りが行われていました。現地の人が、花を散らしながら歩いていました。観光客は、その中にはいませんでしたが、すれ違う時、たくさんの人が笑顔で、手を振ってくれたのが、とても印象的でした。寺院もたくさんあり、とても神秘的な国。一流ホテルや、普通のホテルの前にも、日本でいう神棚の様なものが、必ず設置されていて、信仰深い国だと感じました。のんびり過ごすには、とてもお勧めです♪
50,“hotel phuket”,"Je reviens de phuket ou j'ai sejourné dans un hotel tenu par un jeune francais a kata center ,tres agreable a voir absolument si vous passez par la il se coupera en deux pour acceder au moindre de vos desirs et l'hotel est d'une propreté irreprochable...bonne vacances!"
40,“日本人少ない”,欧米人が多く、日本人に会いたくない人はおすすめ！
50,“Impresionante lugar”,"Me alojé en Karon Beach, en el hotel Sea Sand Karon Resort.Hotel en zona traquila con trato excelente.A tan solo 6 kms. de Patong y su bullicio tanto diario como nocturno. Excelentes restaurantes de todo tipo a 150 mts. del hotel. Excursiones a los mejores lugares de la zona: Phi Phi Islands, city tours..."
