40,On my Bucket List,"This must be one awesome hike because the area was super crowded and you were lucky to find a parking space. It's a gloomy overcast Saturday and it didn't keep people away. We decided on abandoning our hiking for today because of the crowds and come back midweek. The one thing that bothers me are the dirty ignorant litter bugs that visit this beautiful area, plus the jerks who think that tagging rocks is okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
50,Gorgeous long hike,"This was one of the most beautiful and enjoyable hikes I've been on. There isn't much climbing or steep elevation involved so it's nice to just enjoy the outdoors and your gorgeous surroundings, just be aware of your steps! It's very rocky ground. Depending on when you go you will need to cross through multiple rivers and streams and the current can sometimes be a little strong so tread carefully and wisely and bring extra socks! While the hike is pretty moderate it is a long one if you plan to reach the bridge or go past it. My group covered a solid 12 miles that day with one hour rest stop and by mile 11 my knees were feeling it due to the rocky terrain so good shoes and a hiking stick are highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avila_cindy86
50,Must do hike,"Went out on a Friday and there where are not a few cars at the parking lot. The trail officially starts about a mile in from the parking lot, so take that into account.It was a relatively cool day 20c/68F although it felt a lot warmer in the canyon, and the first half had some shade, but the second half you will be walking in the open.Apart from a few climbs and scree crossings the trail is relatively flat and easy going.Had to do 4 river crossings (8 in total going back). Which is really nice at first, taking of my shoes and crossing the river, drying my feet etc. but on the way back the sun started to go down and to make it out of the canyon before dark I just waded to the river in my shoes to save time. Made it out about 40 mins before dark. (I did bring a headlight though).Trip total was 16.5k, just shy of 10 miles and took me about 5,5 hours including having some lunch and relaxation at the bridge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nl_patrick
50,Amazing Fun Hike,"Perfect for those looking for a fun, rewarding hike in SoCal that isn’t completely trashed and over crowded. The bridge is definitely a must do for any hiker and takes about 5-6 hours to complete.Recommend coming early since parking “close” to the trailhead is very limited and an Adventure Pass is required. Be warned, there are snakes, poison oak, spiky plants, and multiple water crossings. You WILL get wet! You can try to rock hop, but you’ll have a greater chance slipping on algae or landing on a loose rock. Water depth ranges from ankle to knee deep.The hike itself is pretty easy for the average hiker with moderate inclines in direct sun on numerous narrow paths. The trail for the most part is fairly clear and easy to follow, but some points can get tricky due to false trails created by campers. Scariest part of the whole hike for us was climbing back up from the water under the bridge. The narrow rocks path are becoming very smooth with all the foot traffic making them hard to grip when trying to climb back up.Advice:- Bring plenty of water!!- Wear comfortable hiking shoes and lightweight clothing.- PACK OUT ALL YOUR TRASH! If you carried it in, you can clearly carry it out to properly toss in the bin in the parking areas.- Dog owners - please use common sense. Don’t use poo bags & just leave them on the trail. They just add more plastic waste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DunkelPaws
50,Quite the adventure,"So i went to do this with my friends for a bachelor party. We decided on booking the overnight along with the 5 jumps each so we wouldn't have to hike back, we could take our time, and just make an event of it. The owner, Ron, was present the entire time. He was kind, calm, knowledgeable, friendly, and more than hospitable. The staff was all of the same as well. The bungee jumping was absolutely insane as anyone would expect, but it was the best experience i can imagine one could have doing something insane. Ron wasn't pushy to the people that didn't want to go and him sharing his knowledge and taking his time made us all super comfortable. I hope to never go back ;), but if i do, i'd be glad it's with this crew and this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reidkaufman

30,Great place to hike to for history,The hike takes you accross the river a number of times and will take you up to 4 hours in and out to get to this piece of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldcU9688MI
50,Weird California,"This is a 10-12 mile hike along the San Gabriel River in the beautiful Sheep Mountain Wilderness to a 120-foot high bridge. The bridge was meant to connect a road, but the road was never built. This a is a long, but relatively flat hike with plenty of stream crossings and water holes to cool off in.But beware--this is wilderness and there are snakes, bugs, rocks, uneven surfaces, etc. Bring water and food. It gets very hot. The parking lot for the Bridge to Nowhere is a fee area, and you need to buy a pass before you arrive at the trailhead. You can use a National Parks Pass or an Adventure Pass. If you like, you can bungee jump off the bridge for $120.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susie1028
50,Amazing Hike! Top 10 in SoCal,"A friend of mine told me about this hike located in the Angeles National Forest. When he told me there was a river that the hike followed with waters crossings in the middle of summer, I thought he was pulling my leg. I agreed to go on this hike and so happy I did. Hwy 39 takes you from Azusa into Angeles National Forest. You pass a couple of lakes as you wind your way up to the trailhead. I advise you get there early because parking fills up quick. There’s camping at the head of the trail, but keep going. As long as you follow the river you can’t get lost, but there are hiking paths along the way. It’s about 5 miles in to reach the Bridge to Nowhere. It was built in 1936 and is now owned by a bungee jumping company. They are out there every weekend and for $120 you can bungee jump from the bridge. If you are like me and have a fear of heights, just cross the bridge and make your way down to the river where there are several pools of water where folks can swim and wade into. The river crossings are greatly appreciated as you hike along this trail and keep your feet cool. I recommend wearing smart wool socks as they dry quickly and protect your wet feet in your hiking shoes. Make sure to bring lots of water as it does get hot and there is an elevation climb to the bridge. I highly recommend this hike and can’t wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsxrgal

50,"Great Hike, Big Horn Sheep and a Bridge to Nowhere","This is now one of my new favorite hikes in LA County. I was joined by 7 other women. We arrive in the parking lot at 6:20am on a Saturday morning in April. We got one of the last spots in the lot. Less than two minutes later cars were filing in. Some people had to park a mile or more away. You must have an Adventure Pass to park in the lot.We began our hike at 6:50am. The water crossing were very easy and once the sun came out, it was refreshing. We stopped several times to take in the view. We saw a family of Big Horn Sheep on the side of the cliff. That was spectacular. We also had to back track twice because the trail was taken out by a landslide. The GPX on Alltrails still shows that trail. Just stick to the River and follow it until you know you are back on the track.We stayed at the bridge for almost an hour. We ate lunch, relaxed and took in the view. Weekends get busy but I really don't mind. I prefer to hike around groups of people than being alone.Our moving time was 6hr and 3min. Total time was about 7 hours and 10 minutes including stops. We were back at our cars by 2pm.Clothing: Early morning layers. I also wore Keen Hiking Boots that I just got wet. I brought an extra pair of socks that I changed into at the bridge. I also put flip flops in my car for the drive home. You can wear closed toe hiking sandals but be aware that there are a lot of small rocks that get in them. A couple ladies in our group wore them and were not thrilled.Take 3 liters of water. I drank all but about a 1/2 liter.There is very little shade for much of the hike so wear and bring sunscreen and a hat. It was cold in the morning but it got very hot in the early afternoon.Take a lot of snacks and a sandwich.There are bathrooms at the trail head but there are NO bathrooms on the trail. Be prepared to squat ladies!And always remember to TAKE YOUR TRASH WITH YOU INCLUDING ORANGE AND BANANA PEELS. They are not natural to the environment and take a long time to decompose. Bring an extra trash bag for all of your trash.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sageskye2304
50,A Must Do (dog friendly) Hike! Beautiful and Fun!,"April 8, 2018 HikeWe finally made it to the Bridge to No Where hike and had the best day! We were a little hesitant based on many varied reviews, but we are here to say this is a must try hike. However, it is not for everyone. So we have what we hope are helpful tips. It took us 6.5 hours round trip but we did take our time and stopped for a while at the bridge. If you were efficient in and out I would estimate you could do it in 5.Getting there: If you GPS it the directions tell you to ""Keep left onto Shoemaker Canyon Rd"" but this is incorrect. You need to stay right on E East Fork Rd. You will go over a white bridge, if you don't you are not going the right way. This road ends in a parking lot on your left and you can park along the road on both sides.What time to get there: We got there at 6:40 am on a Sunday morning and would recommend this time. It was nice and cool out to start the hike, and there was still plenty of parking. The parking lot was already completely full but we parked close by down the side of the street. We waited for our friends until 7:15 am and by that time it was completely packed, for reference on how fast parking fills up.Weather/ temperature: The day was absolutely perfect! It was very chilly when we started, so much so that we saw people bundling in beanies and coats. We didn't want to pack all that out so we wore very few layers. It got to be nicely warm by the time we reached the bridge, even so it was breezy at the top. The hike back was just perfect, the water was refreshing by this point.Will you get wet? Yes! You cross back and forth through water at least 6 - 9 times. On April 8, 2018 the water was at the most knee deep, mostly ankle. But there really is no other way to get across, you have to wade through the water.What to wear: I wore DriFit capris, Nikes with dri-fit socks, a tank, a long sleeve in the morning and a hat and sunglasses in the afternoon. I would highly recommend tennis shoes and socks. I hiked all ten miles going back and forth through the water and I was super comfortable. I was very nervous about hiking in wet shoes but honestly it wasn't bad at all. My feet were never cold and by the time it got warm out wet shoes and walking through the water felt really good.What to bring: sunscreen and lots of water! For two adults and one dog we brought two gallons and two liters and drank almost all of it. We also brought trail snacks and lunch for the bridge, highly recommended as its a long day.Is it dog friendly? For an active, in-shape dog, absolutely! This hike is not for the faint of heart. It is long and rugged terrain, but for a medium to large breed that runs every day it is perfect. Our Doberman had a blast! There were many reviews that made us skeptical about bringing our dog, but this time of year it was fine. There were three large dogs in our group and they all hiked the whole way just fine. No exhaustion, no bleeding pads as some people reference. They were fine. Just be sure to bring them enough water. While dogs should be on leash, almost every dog we came across was off leash but well mannered and behaved. So I would say as long as your dog is dog and people friendly, its a go. We also saw many small dogs on this hike (little fluffy dogs, dachshunds, cocker spaniels), I personally wouldn't bring my small dog on this hike as its just too long and rough for tiny paws.Who can hike this? This hike, while easy, is long and requires endurance and balance. The terrain is pretty uneven so its not great for the elderly or older folks. And I would say it is a little long for kids. There were 8 active adults in our group and it was pretty much a cake walk. We were tired and sore when we finished, so we would recommend stretching before getting in your car to drive home.Where is the trail? This is a little tricky and just requires a little intuition and problem solving. I would say there isn't one main defined trail. There is a visible trail in some places but there is no real clear place that tells you where to cross back and forth the river. So we followed what other people suggested and found it incredibly helpful. You want to stay pretty close to the river, if you can't see it or hear you have veered off the right path. For the most part you'll be hiking on the right side of the river going towards the bridge. We crossed about 7 - 9 times. That seemed about right to us. Our hike back was about 50% different than the hike going, which I why I say its difficult to follow any one path. As long as you stay close to the river you'll be fine.All in all, a great hike. Very scenic the entire time. Keep your eyes out for big horn sheep on the mountain. We were lucky to spot a bunch and it was an epic sight. The bridge is awesome! You can hike to the bottom and swim or picnic. We sat on the bridge and watched the bungee jumpers and ate lunch before hiking back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenJewel
50,Bridge to Nowhere Hike - Easter Sunday,"This the #1 thing to do in Azusa.... hands down. The hike is about 5 miles from the parking area to the Bridge over none paved terrains. Bring hat, and a pair of good hiking shoes. During the 2 to 3 hour hike (in each direction) will require you to cross the stream 5 to 6 times per direction. So plan to get your shoes wet... not a bad thing during a warm day...Beautiful scenery. Limited bathroom access. bring water. wear hat. bring snacks. rocks, sand, dirt, water (knee high at higest during our trip), best not bring small dogs (unless you wanna carry them), limited parking in the lot (park on the side of the road), plan a 5 to 6 hrs time slot, sunscreen, think twice if you are starting the trek 3.5 hrs before sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenC51

50,Bridge to Nowhere Hike,"This is a great hike. Relatively easy and doable for anyone with a moderate amount of experience.The trail is generally readily apparent, although there are sections where there are multiple choices, some of them much better than others. There are multiple river crossings and it is almost inevitable that you will get wet. But so what?It's 5 miles to the bridge. Go early and you might catch sight of big horn sheep coming down to the river to drink. And as an added bonus, if you're coming on a weekend, you might miss the Bungee America crowd.Bring enough water, even with a filter I'm reluctant to drink from the river. It's a 10 mile round trip so pack enough in. It's exposed and can get hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E4551UHjamesh
40,Bungee Jumping on the Bridge to Nowhere,"The hike is between 8 and 10 miles long, requires crossing a shallow river (0.5 ft - 2 ft depth) roughly 8 times. Finding the path is somewhat difficult. I would suggest going with someone who has already hiked this trail before. There are only bathrooms at the beginning of the trail. Also, no water stations along the trail. At the end of the hike is the Bridge to Nowhere. If you plan on bungee jumping, contact Bungee America a day or two prior to sign up online. It is possible to go without paying in advance but there is a 20 dollar surcharge for paying the day of. The bungee jumping is extremely safe and definitely worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flamintomatr
50,Warning Rock Fall!,"Warning!! This Trail needs help! I have been hiking this trail for years but in several places it has become Dangerous. On Friday July 21st 2018, I was hit by rock fall out of nowhere at about 2 or 2,5 miles in. I was backpacking the main trail. My goal was a two night trip. One of the rocks hit me in the ankle, there was blood everywhere. The rock also broke my Tibia in my left leg. Thanks to the kindness of strangers and a really well stocked medical kit I did not bleed to death and was able to make it out. Maybe there is nothing that can be done and this was just a freak accident. But I believe it could happen again with no warning. I believe the trail needs some help in several places to make it safer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caligypsea

30,Went for the bungee jump,I hiked to the bridge for a bungee jump. And whilst I love the outdoors and exploring I think if my sole purpose had been to see the bridge I would have been slightly disappointed. It is quite cool to see a bridge that looks like it's been randomly placed going nowhere due to the road being washed away a long time ago and never rebuilt but if you are hiking the national forest I would say go to enjoy the scenery or for the bungee jump rather them specifically to see the bridge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amy270486
50,Bridge to Nowhere is...as advertised,"Been doing this hike for years now. There are quite a few stream crossings, so bring appropriate footwear. Insiders Tip: At the end of the hike leave the bridge and hike around the other side of the mountain. there is access to a tunnel/cave which was hollowed out to make way for the road. Also a great place to camp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sappel222

40,A very sunny hike!,"A great hike best done in the fall, winter, or spring. Not a huge elevation gain, but following the trail can be challenging at times (even though all trails seem to end up in the same place). We really enjoyed the 1936 era bridge and watching people bungie jump off it. Not a lot of shade on the trail, so take a lot of water and sunscreen and wear a hat. The river is low, but crossing it requires some attention if you don't want to get wet. It is definitely worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401RichardH
50,"Great hiking, great jump","We registered for the Friday team and in total there were about 20-30 people. According to the guide it was a pretty small group. She told us there could be up to 80 people per team during the weekend. Never underestimate the hike! At least 2 hours one way, no restroom (there was one in the parking lot at the beginning, and another one 10 minutes later around the camping area, that's it). It could get super hot on the way back. I got terribly sunburnt and ran out of water, but it was so fun!!!About the jump, it was fast so not scary at all. The fun thing was standing on the tiny little deck and getting ready to jump: it was the moment of courage! Be proud of it.It was almost a full day event (7:30 am - 3pm) on the trail. I would say the difficulty of the tail is a little bit above average (considering the hike on the lose stones) so I'm not sure if it is good for kids or elder people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28yunm
50,Long but awesome hike,"We did this hike on New Year's Eve day. It took us 7 hours, but we were a group of 3 people all over the age of 60. One of our group members had trouble and had to slow down, it's not the physical part that's hard but determining which side of river that the trail is on. We did at least 5 river crossings each way. We didn't want to get our feet wet since it was December so for most of the crossings we changed into water shoes. This slowed us down too. The canyon is beautiful even if you can't go all the way to the bridge. Try to stay on the right (east) side of the river whenever you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnMcC17
50,"A great hike, with a show at lunchtime","This ten mile roundtrip hike is best done in spring and fall, since a lot of it is exposed to midday sun. Yes there are shady portions of the trail but the last 1.5 mi or so to the bridge is in full sun. As with all SoCal hikes, wear a hat to shade your face, and wear sunscreen of keep all skin covered. Once there, you get treated to a pretty good show, watching bungee jumpers hurling themselves off the bridge.Recommend arriving at the trailhead early, for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevincA8344UK
50,Awesome hike!,The hike to Bridge To nowhere was awesome! I love the experience of finding your own trail especially after doing your bungee jump.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6591QGvincentb
50,MOST awesome adventure ever! I bungee jumped off this bridge :),"A medium rough hike to get to the bridge. I think it was around a 5 hr hike (to and from total). We had some awesome guides that lead you to the bridge. On the way back you can leave without the group. If you get lost, just follow the river. There are several hikes to get back to the parking lot. If you are jumping, you can pay for more jumps at the actual bridge. They give you a free awesome shirt as well. I was impressed with how organized and professional the staff was. They are all pretty kind and the jokes the main guy said (forgot his name but he is AWESOME) were pretty hilarious. Good energy and vibes from them. It was pretty fun meeting all types of people jumping and prepping for your upcoming jump. I did 2 jumps (front and back) and omg....it was INSANE! You have to push yourself off of a tiny 1 foot ledge on the outer part of the bridge. It was trippy! Of cousre I screamed like I got murdered but this was my favorite bucketlist adventure! You get your hike and jump in, not bad at all :) Get there early or else they will leave without you!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Afghana_S_K
40,Worthwhile long hike,"Long hike (about 10 miles round trip from the parking lot trailhead), that is deceptively uphill all the way in one direction. Some great sights, several crossings of a river/creek, and fascinating history when you get to the namesake bridge (with an option to bungee jump). Go past the bridge and back down to water level for dips in the swimming holes or see some actual (small) spring-fed waterfalls. Bring lots of water and energizing snacks (bring more water than you think you'll need), to stay well hydrated, or else you'll be light-headed and tired before you are home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
50,"Great hike, go when its cool out.","My wife and I did this hike yesterday. We got to the trailhead at 5:08pm and back to the car by 8:10pm. We ran most of the way (the parts that one can run). It is a sold 10 mile round trip hike. The weather was perfect. We spent about 20 minutes at the bridge. It really does go to ""nowhere"" it ends in the side of the mountain. Pretty hike to do though. The path isn't marked at all so make sure you stay to the right. Also, when you are about 1 mile and a half before getting to the bridge look up at the mountain side and see where the old road use to be get up to that road and take that all the way in to the bridge. If you stay in the canyon where all the rocks are and follow that path, it'll take much longer to get to the bridge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlaCalifornia
50,Stamina building for Havasu Falls,Did this hike with a group of coworkers since we are getting ready to visit Havasu Falls and its grueling 10 mile hike.. This was good practice and no one complain much after reaching the water holes.. This has always been amazing and after rains the water couldn't feel better.. I recommend this to anyone who wants to really work out and push themselves.. It's mentally challenging and please don't take your dogs.. Their paws will bleed and they won't be able to walk.. Is like you walking barefooted and believe me you wouldn't do it so..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinmT6106PM
50,its a bridge going nowhere,"So who else wants to spend a day to go nowhere... let alone I bet you are not going nowhere very fast... Javier S gave me a load of crap on this I might add... and I walked right into it (pun not intended)...Well this is one of the longest hikes I have been on in So Cal and sometimes will require significant wading depending on the season. If you go during the summer/hot periods, take a camelback as you must have lots of h2o! NO SERIOUSLY BRING LOTS OF WATER!PRO TIP #1: Ask to refill your water at the bungee jump spot on the bridge as they have a filter =)The Bungee America bungee jump is the only California legal bungee jump in the entire state. They have not had an accident and it's a pretty rocken set up that they have, except that there is not a restroom!PRO TIP #2: Bring your swimsuit (bikini under clothes for girls, guys may want to hike in theirs depending on type/style) and a smaller towel so you can go rock jumping just past the bridge or just lounge in a cool mountain stream pool.The trail requires good hiking boots. This is due to varying terrain at every turn and numerous rocks and places to climb/retain good traction while moving through them. There are also a number of sandy areas as well, so be ready for all kinds of stuff to get into your feet, if you are wearing open toed shoes. Many of the stream crossings have rocks and or trees that you can cross the stream on. Granted if you don't have good balance or hiking poles, expect to take a dip.PRO TIP #3: You must have an adventure pass to park here. Pay attention to the parking ok areas. We had to hike an extra 2 miles due to parking. If we had just parked willy nilly, it was a $63.00 ticket and the cops handed out more than a book of tickets they said!!!The restrooms on this hike are at the trailhead and about a mile into the hike. That is it! The rest of the hike will require a dip in the stream, a nice shrub, or a thick boled tree. I highly suggest a plastic bag and a small amount of baby wipes or something similar for some sanitary options while on the hike.PRO TIP #4: Bring lunch to eat near the bridge. You will need sustenance and if you don't have it, well you are going to be really hurting by the end of the hike.The hike itself is a fairly flat hike with a very minor grade. However there are a number of rock formations which you must clamber over or around. So I implore you to wear appropriate footwear. The nature views are excellent but there is no dramatic vista, except to look at the bridge itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schel74

40,Awesome Experience!!,"This is no trip for the weak or faint of heart! There is a 10 mile round trip hike that is through woods, desert trails, high cliffs and rocky narrow paths. You cross a stream several times, so be prepared to get wet! You leave in the early morning so the heat is not an issue, but in the afternoon the sun was brutal, beating down on you as you traversed the desert trail high above the canyon below. There are no bathrooms anywhere so be prepared for that too. After hiking for 5 miles you come upon this bridge spanning the gorge across this small river/stream, looking quite out of place in the middle of nowhere! The crew in charge were all so VERY VERY nice and really fun people. They helped to make the whole experience one of a lifetime! If this is not on your bucket list....it should be!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinda10
40,Pretty cool hike,"I found out about this hike and decided to try it today. It's in Azusa, CA and is pretty easy to find.We took the 210 east, exited route 39 and drove north. The street gets windy and you take a right off of east fork dr. and get there about 6 miles after that. Get a parking permit! We didn't have one and got there pretty late in the day so some guys were nice enough to give us their day pass.The hike itself is not difficult. It's just long and changes terrain quite a bit. There are a lot if creeks that you will have to wade through so bring water shoes or expect to get your feet wet. I did the hike in wet Nikes and I was able to so it just fine but it got annoying towards the end. The climb is minimal but you will have to scramble through some rocks here and there. We saw beautiful scenery throughout and even a ram on the mountainside!I might attempt to bungee jump off of the bridge one of these days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3459W
50,Best hike of my life,"This is one of the best hikes of my life. Beautiful scenery and I love the fact that you can see old washed out bridges and roads along the way. If you can, don't go on a weekend unless you want big crowds. If you go on a weekend I guess you can pay to bungee jump. Depending on when you go, there can be a lot of water, especially after the snow melts. It is easy to find, though there is no exact trail. Just follow the water and you will get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkylerV_12
50,Hiking to bungee jump off the Bridge to Nowhere,"Talk about an epically unforgettable experience. Not only was the 10-mile round trip hike awesome, but once we had finally reached our destination, our reward was bungee jumping! Bungee America offers bungee jumping all year round, rain or shine, off the Bridge to Nowhere. Check out our post on the awesome adventure we had, photos and videos included, enjoy! :)http://mrandmrsadventure.com/2013/12/11/bungee-jumping-off-the-bridge-to-nowhere-with-bungee-america/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsAdventure
50,Fascinating surprise,"Hiking down the San Gabriel River, starting just above Wrightwood, initially the river was narrow and just carrying the recent snowmelt. The further we went downriver the water began to roar and the trail disappeared here and there requiring us to bushwhack our way through the vegetation and occasionally wade our way towards Azusa. You can imagine our surprise when we came to the Bridge and Tunnel to Nowhere.Most people come up river and complain about the trail, or lack of, as they go to the Bridge to Nowhere. I challenge anyone to approach it from up river. It's at least a two day hike and thoroughly a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,"Very odd ending point, must see","Did this hike about a year ago with a group of 50 of us, and there must have been 1000 people total on this 10 mile out and back trail. It still didn't seem crowded though. What is really fun at least for me is the stream crossings and the really truly odd site at the end where the bungee jumping is. The hike itself is ??? - well it's dry LA, and indeed it is hot in the summer (don't recommend it in the height of summer). The Yucca's are really pretty cool, and the areas of scrambling on the sides of a rock slope (only a ten foot fall if you slip - not too much injury) are mildly fun for this 60 year old. Not having done many river crossings, I really enjoyed the water crossings (about 15 of them). I don't rock hop even without a 50 lbs pack. If you ""slog"" through knee high rivers I recommend comfortable old hiking boots, and be prepared to hike 7 out of the 10 miles in wet boots (actually works better than you think - and my boots did not know the difference, nor my feet). Remember to face down stream, and poles likewise down stream and walk sideways). If your young and a gazelle, and don't want to get wet - then rock hop and go for it (it can be done). It was crazy at the bridge, and that was where the people were. Jumps every 5 minutes while I was there (it's very professionally done - I think they have had the contract for the past 20 years - ""bungy america? might be the name of the company).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrJR17
40,Deadend,Backpacked through from the north a few years ago. Kind an amazing monument to governmental stupidity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814TomB814
40,really good hike,easy to get lost... we were guided to the bridge for bungee jumping but decided to leave without waiting for the guides to finish up and got lost a few times... nice easy hike though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz
40,not an easy hike on a hot day,"Just went on a hike to Bridge to Nowhere recently, it was the hottest day of the summer ..not a good choice. Beautiful views and interesting hike, 5 miles to the bridge and 5 miles back. We were glad we made it back. On the way back the heat was unbearable, especially the long stretch of the hike that was done up the mountain until we reached the creek again and could cool off in all our clothes.We checked the web for previous hikers advice and got prepared2. Bring at least 48 or more oz of water per person, you'll use it all3. Bring sunblock4. Wear old sport shoes or water shoes with a support, you'll cross the creek many times5. Wear the clothes that you don't mind to get wet, you'll get wet crossing the creek.6. Bring power bars, dry fruits & pack lunch, you'll get hungry.7. Bring camera to take pics8. Bring good happy attitude!We left around 8 am and came back around 3 pm with a few stops on the way and 2 hours break by the bridge. we had lunch and walked little longer passed the bridge to the natural pools, where we could swim and cool off. You could also watch bungee jump (About $100 per person to jump) from the bridge. No one in our group have done it, but it was fun to watch other people. Make a day out of this trip and enjoy! oh yea and we got to see handful of Bighorn sheep on the way back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip24
50,Best hike ever.....,"I actually done this hike back in '09 but felt it was worth a review as it was such a great hike.I done this hike late Oct '09, we started at 0800 as its a full day hiking and at that time of year if you're not there and back before it starts getting dark then it could get tricky as it gets seriously dark and navigating is a problem!!The hike itself was great, a real adventure as it was quite easy to stray off the route as theres no set path, although people have left small markers to help keep you from straying off the route too much. Even though i was with people who had done the route a few times they still went wrong couple times and we had to turn back to get on the correct route.So yes we reached the bridge after a few hours, stopped for a quick lunch before turning round and coming back - seeing the bridge in the middle of nowhere really is quite bizarre as the connecting road was washed away long ago - getting back down we had a blister problem so was slow going and just made it out as night fell and it was pitch black!apparently the best time to visit is in the spring when the snow has melted and the water level of the river is highest.....love to do it again if i ever get to california again :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chippy73
40,Beautiful Hike,"This hike is long but not too hard. It is a bit confusing where the trail leads off to. I got lost many times, but it follows the river so you won't get lost. But, if you do travel up the river be prepard to get wet a face a bit of a challenge climbing rocks and swiming a little bit. You will eventually make it to the bridge. From there you can do a steep climb to the bridge. Don't bring things that you don't want getting wet like your phone. If you are lucky enough to follow the trail up to the bridge there are some areas where there can be a bit of a challenge and little room for stepping. It can be dangerous but I did see a family of hikers and the father carrying a 2 year old on his back with one of those back packs that carry kids. No matter which way you take you will still have to cross the river a bunch of times, so you will get wet. The water can reach up to your waist in some areas. Once you are arrive you can take in the beautiful river and enjoy a lunch.This hike is not for people who don't like to get wet or for people who don't like a little bit of a challenge. I would not recommend this hike for young children. Also start early. This hike is 10+ miles. If you start around 9 or 10 in the morning you will probably finish around 4 or 5 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickMcNally
50,Bridge to Nowhere,"Go into the Angeles Park from Azusa and take the East Fork Rd right to the end and you will find the trail entrance. It mianders along the San Gabriel River. The trail starts out as a defined trail, and then you have to do some river crossings across logs or rocks. Its a kind of ""make your own way"" in places but always seems to be a trail somewhere. Someone advised us to stay on the R) hand side of the river....good advise as there is an elevation gain of 1000ft which you don't really notice. But...you do end up needing to be on the R) trail which is elevated above the river to get to the Bridge, which is high above the river. Take money or a credit card with you incase you want to Bungy jump off the bridge. I went in spring. Plenty of wildflowers and the scenery is beautiful. One of the most picturesque trails we have done in the San Gabriels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbunny63
50,Good get away from the city.,"I've hiked to the bridge to know where multiple times, great hike but I've never done the jump, 7 mile hike one way. I'm usually there just to camp out by the river. It's a good escape from the city and close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sal96ss
50,Hiking and Jumping - Oh My!,"Want to hike, laugh, get wet, jump off a bridge and survive? Go to these guys!The entire team of Bungee America instructors is comprised of professional stunt dudes who offer kind advice, patience, and the ability to instill the utmost sense of confidence in the equipment and what they tell you to do.Chris, our ""guide-to-instruction"" was ""buckle-me-over"" hilarious. He kept it real, kept it short, and said things like ""Now, you hook on the carabiner. If you are screwing or unscrewing anything, the only thing you are screwing is yourself"" Hahaahha.Read more about the do's and dont's of jumping the Bridge to Nowhere (and how to get one of the guys' jackets for the morning) here: http://offthecouchla.blogspot.com/2011/05/bridge-to-nowhere-bungee-jump.html",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Offthecouchla
