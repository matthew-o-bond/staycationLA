50,The Southwest Museum - Then and Now,"My reason for rating the Southwest Museum as Excellent has NOTHING to do with its current state, both physical and the awful decision to move the incredibly extensive and extraordinary collection of Native American artifacts to the Gene Autry Museum (apparently, permanently). The Autry, cool in its own right, is and has always primarily been an American Southwestern Museum, highlighting the American cowboy lifestyle, which is fine but they are NOT the same thing as Native American, nor should they be treated as such. The Autry does NOT have the proper physical space nor (evidently) the desire to show the SWM collection as the collection has sat boxed, for no one to see, for years.It's sad and heartbreaking really, given this incredible moment in Los Angeles that has FINALLY landed Los Angeles on the Global Art Scene and so many people (young and well, not so young) are so interested in the LA art and culture boom that is happening all over the city and the Autry is missing a HUGE opportunity to bring the SWM museum back for ALL to enjoy. The northeast pocket, Highland Park/Mount Washington is so ALIVE, culturally speaking, and is the PERFECT place for it. So much so that it's heartbreaking to see this amazing building watch all of the energy around it, while it sits mostly empty, showcasing more Autry pieces in a couple of rooms, along with some Lummis pieces, but mostly, 90% empty space. Its just sad to watch the SWM be left out of this amazing time in LA history. Leaving many newcomers and locals too, to wonder, that gorgeous building nestled there off the Pasadena freeway, I wonder what that is...?My reason for rating the Southwest Museum as Excellent, has A L L to do with what the SWM once was. The building, the space, the collections, the tunnel at the ground floor when you entered through Museum Drive - walking 40 yards in a softly lit, yet still dark long tunnel with about 50 or so small model Native American created scenes displayed into the walls that lined the walkway. These scenes varied widely. It was was better than being in a toy store for a young child. It was AWESOME! When you took the elevator up into the actual museum, it was massive, stunning space with countless pieces of art, artifacts, real tee-pees displayed, incredible taxidermy pieces, etc. You could walk up the staircase and along the walls of the tallest portion of the building, looking out these windows was such a memorable experience. I lived nearby in blue-collar Highland Park. I was a kid that walked home from school most days, not far from the SWM and I visited it regularly, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends who were walking home with me. I'm now in my 50's, and as latino native Angelino, the biggest reason I appreciated the SWM so much, was that I ALWAYS felt welcomed. It was my introduction to the Arts, which later led to working at the LA Music Center which is also an extraordinary place in LA that is equally as comfortable and welcoming. To give some contrast, my first visits as a young person to The Norton Simon Museum or the Huntington Library, it was not the same welcoming experience. It was more like the feeling you get when you walk into a high end gallery that doesn't exactly invite everyone in. So to me, and I have to imaging many others, the SWM is sooo incredibly important to Los Angeles for so many reasons and should be brought back to life, restored to when it was, in the eyes of a young latino pre-teen, the coolest place he had ever been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LABlackAngel
30,Somewhat Disappointing,"While this is a wonderful building to showcase native arts, it was disappointing that not very much was displayed of the items Mr Lummis collected. It seems that most of that collection is at the Autry, but not on display for anyone to see. The pottery was beautiful and interesting, but this is an hour max (and that’s generous) to view what is on display. We drove 2 hours to get there so we were somewhat disappointed that so little native artifacts were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetk9
40,Small but beautifu; interesting Indian art,"This small museum on the hill, established in 1914. Mainly archeological art of the Gabrielini and Tongva Indians. A visit worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
40,"The renovations are well under way, and the exhibit is terrific","The Southwest Museum, which is located in a historic building, had become run down, as had its building. You can easily find old reviews complaining about its poor condition and the lack of good exhibits.Ignore those out-of-date reviews! We were there in May 2018. The museum’s renovations are looking good. The exhibit we saw, American Indian pottery, was exceptionally well done. The pots were amazing, and the accompanying explanations were in large, easy-to-read print, educational, and fascinating, setting each item of pottery in its historical, social, and cultural context.After we viewed the pots, we went up to the terrace, which has a panoramic view of L.A. and a garden with many kinds of interesting cacti and succulents. The man who had taken care of the garden for many years is no longer doing so. The garden seemed to need care. We were told that volunteers were being recruited to do that.A few years ago, when the Southwest Museum was on really hard times, its management was taken over by the Autry Museum. That’s why the proper name of the Southwest Museum is now The Autry’s Historic Southwest Museum.Currently the Southwest Museum’s shop is included in the shop at the Autry. We’ve been there too, and the shop is very good, with interesting items in many price ranges. Right now, at the Southwest Museum, the exhibit space is limited and there’s no shop because of the continuing renovation of the building.The museum is open from 10 to 4 on Saturdays only. While the renovations are being completed, there is no entry charge.We went on the once-a-year “Museums of the Arroyo” Day, which is held one Sunday in May. The museum was open from noon to 5 p.m. Entrance was free, and a free shuttle bus was available to take visitors to the other museums participating in this one-day event. There were other visitors, but it wasn’t crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ms_Yokohama2014
50,Beautiful artefacts with an interesting history,"We travelled by train to the museum, the pedestrian entrance is via a long tunnel and lift, an experience in itself. The displays are very interesting. The gardens are beautiful and its all free. I urge you to take a trip to The Lummis House just down the road, the hand built home of the founder of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caroline-Bennett
40,Small Museum Focusing On Pottery,"The first museum in Los Angeles was started in 1907. This structure was built in 1913-14 and is a National Historic Building. There are examples of pottery by the American Indians dating from the 14th century. It is now part of the Autry National Center and much of the artifacts have been moved to another location. The museum is free and you can expect to spend about an hour perusing the collection. There is also a native garden. Many people who expect a full museum would be disappointed at the smallness of this one. If you have the time and are nearby, it is worth it if you are interested in Native American pottery. Currently the museum is only open on Saturdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray-n-Sol
30,Wait until the renovations are done before visiting,"We visited the SW Museum on Mt Washington for the first time in a dozen years. The grounds are nice, especially from the parking lot to the museum. The collections displayed are VERY limited right now. There is one room where the perimeter has a nice pottery timeline displayed. Otherwise, the tunnel is empty, and there are no baskets on display AT ALL. Since that is there specialty, I'd advise waiting for the renovations to be complete before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
20,Essentially the museum is closed,"This museum was grand and beautiful 8-10 years ago. Apparently, the building structure began to deteriorate and water began to leak in putting all of the artifacts at risk. With no money to repair, the Gene Autry Museum stepped in and bought the artifacts and appear to be displaying or housing the artifacts. Now The Southwest Museum is mostly an empty building, while they see how to preserve the beautiful icon. So sad. You can now cover the museum in 10 minutes with only a little bit of pottery being displayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWind26
10,Southwest Museum -- Not Worth the Trip,"There must be a complicated back-story, but this museum is definitely not worth a visit. As an occasional LA visitor from back East, I looked forward to visiting this museum during the years it was closed for renovation. Now only open on Saturday, it is a very big disappointment. There's not much to see, and you don't come away having learned anything. You have the feeling this must be a tax dodge for wealthy patrons who get together and give themselves parties, but this may be too cruel. I just can't understand what's going on. If they have anything worthy of display but can't figure out how to so it, they ought to divvy the stuff up among the Smithsonian and other public institutions, and just go out of business. This is a beautiful site with nothing in it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60726Nicky_11
20,Southwest Museum - Sad remnant of what it once was,"The Southwest Museum, Los Angeles' oldest museum housed one of the most extensive collections of Native American artifacts. It was and is a beautiful edifice. I can remember going there with my children and viewing amazing artifacts from across the Southwest.Today it is the unfortunate victim of reconstruction and refurbishment that leaves a billion dollar collection in boxes, some of it carted away to the Autry Museum and much of it in boxes stored in two yet to be ""galleries"" and storage rooms.It appears that Autry maintains control of it and has greatly diminished its offerings.It's odd that the museum was ""reopened"" with virtually nothing to show to the public. You can walk in through the upper entrance look through locked doors at the two closed galleries with boxes piled high, serving as storerooms, and go downstairs to the lovely reception area ...with no artifacts. Then some more stairs leads to ...the bathrooms, with no more than a handful of artifacts in cases along the way.The guard advised that the first gallery will open in Dec 2012 or Jan 2013, and the second, sometime after that. However I cannot imagine that these two, what seem to me as, over-built galleries could possibly do justice to a billion dollar collection.I don't know why the Southwest has allowed to fall into this derelict condition, with absolutely none of it's former grandeur ...that is unless an air conditioned edifice qualifies as a museum, which it does not. ...And let me be clear, the edifice is beautiful, but I believe, even in design, with insufficient space for the collection. ...The museum board and management has done a terrible disservice to the community and what was once a Los Angeles landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaybobb
