50,Once Upon A Time,"Once upon a time, I had an office on the 5th floor of the Hollywood Equitable Building, located at this legendary crossroad. The walk of stars, Capitol Records and the Pantages Theater are all within the block and everything Tinseltown is a short distance away. Sometimes seedy, sometimes glamorous, always entertaining. Happy trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569claudef
50,Outstanding buildings at the historic centre of entertainment,"On either side of the Boulevard on Vine St are two grand edifices, the eponymous building and Taft.As the first high-rise in the vicinity, Taft dates from 1923 and was home to many of the early studios.Fine views of the iconic Capitol Records are afforded from the meeting point of the two thoroughfares.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,It Chapter Two Experience,"This pop up fun house is amazing! A walk through Fun house in anticipation of the movie! VIP line available with IMAX movie ticket verification! VIP line 5 min wait, standby line up to three hours. You are able to play carnival games for tickets you can redeem at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanmendoza0113
20,Run down and over priced,We stayed in the area and Vine Street and surprised by the run down condition of the area. We felt uncomfortable going out at night due to the amount of “street people “ hanging around harassing passerby people demanding money or screaming at us,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpS4312GB
30,City of Angels,"For 80 years the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street has basked in a mystique. These days it's the centerpiece of Los Angeles' most ambitious redevelopment effort. That kind of combination has been a staple at the corner since 1903 when a sunny lemon grove was uprooted to make way for Hollywood's first church congregation. The intersection was known as Prospect and Weyse Avenues when landowner Daeida Beveridge gave members of the German Methodist Church the southeast corner. Prospect Avenue, the main artery was renamed Hollywood Boulevard and Weyse Avenue became Vine Street. This was the origin of Hollywood and Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWarrenM
20,Dirty and tired,Dirty and tired not how I remember Hollywood back 20years ago. Lots of homeless roaming the streets shouting and intimidating people. Not a great way to welcome tourists to your country,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barnicleLondon
30,Start of Walk of Fame and more,"This is the famous corner that made Hollywood famous in songs. It is where, fittingly, the Walk of Fame starts. It's where the famous Patages Theater still sits. Not much anymore then a piece of history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
50,Ready Player One Chall,"As a promotion to the upcoming movie, Ready Player One, they came up with a fun challenge. It’s just a maze you walk through finding three keys to save the Oasis. It was a fun event with great picture opportunities. It was for the weekend for invited guests in an empty parking lot set up. Great event and had a lot of fun with my friend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimBlackDragon
30,Nothing Special Anymore,"We went to this Intersection because while growing up, we always heard about it, but I expect today's young people have no clue what it even was. It seemed nothing more than just a regular intersection, although it did mark the start of the ""Walk of Fame"" with all of the famous Stars. Check it out if you would like to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat
30,Where Hollywood began,"This is where it all began. First of all, yes, Hollywood & Vine is an intersection and a very busy intersection at that. But, this is where it all started...the Pantages theatre is here, old time movie stars and true celebrities like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Audrey Hepburn are down at this end. I am impressed at how they have cleaned up this end of the Walk of Fame. When I was there 14 years ago, this end of the Walk of Fame was dirty and dingy and kind of creepy. It has now been renovated and in fact, right at 1600 Vine Street by the stars of Grant and Gable, there is now a new Trader Joe's. Yes, it is an intersection, yes it is incredibly crowded, but it is a historic part of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbrenz
40,Iconic place,Iconic place. 20 years ago I might have said avoid this area and run the other way. It has vastly improved with hotels and shops. It is still possible to look down Hollywood Boulevard and visualize its heydays. Check out the art work in the subway station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
20,Why would you bother,"Akamaikai gets it right, it may have been relevant many years ago but today there is little of interest - I hadn't been here for years so it was more curiosity that brought me here. Other than the nearby ""stars"" on the footpath , it is a combination of some new buildings plus areas of deay, none of which by themselves are interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
10,"Let's get this straight, people...","Hollywood and Vine is an intersection. I don't care that 70 years ago a star was discovered crossing the street, that Hollywood doesn't exist any more. Now you have a busy intersection with no shops or restaurants of interest to speak of, and why anyone would bother to do anything other than drive through this intersection on their way someplace more important is beyond me.Okay, granted, if you are on foot, the hollywood walk of fame is centered around this intersection, but all the movie studios and production facilities are long gone and there is nothing to see there except, admittedly, a nice view of the Capitol Records building.Don't waste your time unless you are there for another reason. Why this is of any interest to tourists boggles my mind!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Akamaikai
30,Interesting place,"This area is interesting to see for first time visitors to Hollywood as I am sure it is not what tourists expect. I would say this area is safe but definitely worth being cautious over, especially at night. Other than that seeing all of the stars, interesting locals and theatres is an entrancing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackmoore93
20,Busy,One of those locations to go just so you can say you went. Busy and crowded but another block checked. Good people watching and worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlsS521AE
40,I'm ready for my close up,"I came, I saw, I got stuck in traffic.. It was worth the ride but man the traffic is terrible. We had a great time seeing all the stars on the walk of fame. A great time on Hollywood and Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jabii1969
40,Great for character interaction,We went to Hollywood and Vine for a late lunch. We waited for a few minutes for our table but when we got in we had a great seat near the buffet. The lunch was pretty good and we went up for seconds. The best part was the interaction with the Disney jr characters. Even my nine year ago was enthralled. Definitely recommend for the Disney jr fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennay513
50,Historical Hollywood,Hollywood and Vine is a great part of the city the continuous row of stars still goes outside Hollywood and Vine station with great views and charm. Just as interesting as the Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643ricz
20,Lots of Traffic,"Went through in the dark. Terrible traffic, Highways are worse, with lots of cars, and stupid motorcyclists driving between the cars. Always looking to see at least one pulled over, or crashed, but no luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shamrockofthesky
30,Hollywood & Vine,"Very notable intersection in Los Angeles. It's busy with people and traffic. Lots of shops, restaurants, things to do. The best way to see the area is with a guide and a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/387indy
50,THE Sestination for Aspiring Stars and Starlets,"In Hollywood's heyday, this intersection was every bit as famous as the Hollywood Sign. Nowadays not so much, just a photo op for those who remember and want. To talke a snap or two of the street sign on the corner. Plenty of tourist trap things and shopping nearby. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
30,Stay to the East,While it the famous intersection not much on these corners. Most of the action and touristy things todo are to the east on Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattD2762
20,Dirty,"Came to the Pentages Theater to see Newsies. The parking was reasonable and we were excited to explore the area. For all its hype of glitz and glamour it's really nothing more than a dirty street with some stars on the ground. People begging all over, nothing to do or see, getting hit up every block by street vendors. Didn't make it all the way down to Ripleys because of all the sketchy charachter a around I was uncomfortable to take my wife that far. Disappointing to say the least",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itsadadslife
30,Clubs and bars,"In the daytime you might walk up here looking at the outer reaches of the Walk of Stars and the Capitol Records buildings. In the evening it comes to life, you even wonder where have some of the night clubs have sprung from and people frequent the bars or line up to get into some underground club.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
30,Cool bars and vibe,It is just a street corner but a good place to start or end your tour of Hollywood. Right near the metro and decent bars and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennaCoy
20,Take a pic of the Capitol Records and your done,"Easy spot to get to via the metro red line but little to see and not many food choices. The W Hotel which sits almost on top of the subway stop is the nicest hotel in the area. The Capitol records building is iconic and is a half block away (North of Hollywood Blvd, walk North on Vine).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillB777_12
20,Not Much There To See,The only thing worth seeing is the metro station with film reels on the ceiling. Take the next stop to Hollywood and Highland. A hundred times better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burgerwars
20,famous street corner,This could be iconic and may have been at one time. Nothing really there and very dirty. only safe in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waco042
20,What's the Hype?,"Went here around 6 PM via subway. Got out and walked around a bit to find a restaurant to eat. Was told there was a good steak place a few blocks from the subway station. After walking for about fifteen minutes, we decided that this area was too seedy for us and got back on the subway. What a waste of time. Area was desolate, seemed like there were quite a few drug addicts walking the street. Did not want to come out of the restaurant and have to walk back to the subway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeLoveTraveling23
30,Interesting but Aggrivating,Interesting to see but very crowded and alot of people trying to push information on you. Should have more traffic control in the area and the city should do something about soliciting pamphlets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyA29
30,Once upon a Time,"Was at one time, year 40 years ago, when I was a kid--pretty amazing- just the name--now it is a hustle & bustle of geeks, drug heads & buildings that have been re-done to meet the necessity of merchandising to it's public",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWalter
40,A good choice to look for a fun night life,"Been around this area many times. There are many things to do here ranging from night clubs, bars/lounges, performing art venues, shopping, dinning. I would highly recommend this area if you're up for some fun night life activities. Even if you're not sure what you want to spend the night doing with your friends yet. Just go to this area and I'm highly confident you'll find something here you'll like to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaL143
40,Classic Spot,"It's infamous, it's also known as Will Rodgers Square, it's got the Capitol Records building, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If you're in the neighborhood, you're bound to cruise past this intersection, so stop and drink it in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbucka
20,It's a street corner...,"The best part of this ""attraction"" is that you can get a good picture of Capitol Records from here. Period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamikaR_12
30,Ordinary,I love the Pantages Theater but the surrounding area lacks the vibrancy of the Hollywood and Highland area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/California9
30,Not very special unless you like icons,"Not very special, some nice shops and cafes, but a must see if you like icons like the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OttoDerFlieger

30,Ok - See it if you are in the area,We were in area for a Starline tour across the street. Fun to visit if you are already going to that area. No worth a special trip. It a really big mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasTraveler4fun
