40,lots of unusual items,"There are some typical flea market items here, but there is also a lot of items you might not think of; handmade stationery, Mexican blankets, vegan leather, some furnishings you need for your apartment, or that perfect souvenir coffee cup from some restaurant somewhere else in LA. It's well worth a visit. A lot of it is on a level of the parking garage so it is protected from the weather even if it's raining. Plan to go early and spend some time, since the vendors close down even before the official end time if they run out of products.",Antarctix7
50,One of the best in Southern California,"First, admission is free, 1st Sunday of every month, collectables, period furniture, vinyl, great tamales, lots of period clothing, something for everyone.",Jim V
50,A day long affair from 7am to 3pm,"This is a trip! The swap meet is officially from 7am to 3pm but some vendors arrive earlier. There is a record section in the covered parking lot and floors/areas of all kinds of hobbies and things to collect, some are covered and some out in the sunshine so no matter the weather, you're good to go. The school has booths all over selling everything from breakfast to beverages and some of the vendors give dog treats. It's the first Sunday of every month.",dbajet
50,A whole new world.,"If you happen to be in Pasadena on the first Sunday of any month, PCC Flea Market is definitely an activity you do not want to miss. If you're an antique hunter, a student who is in need to furnish your dorm, a gay man who want something fab for your living room / bedroom / bathroom / kitchen, a lesbian who is in need to color match your new home (one that you build from scratch), or a straight couple (GASP) who appreciate finer things that are pre-owned... oh well even if you're a pretentious, classless, not sophisticated individual who want to give your friends/families a good impression of yourself and the house you live in, PCC Flea Market is the place to be.One part of the market is an outdoor flea market where you can stroll along and enjoy the nice sunny weather (unless it's raining, in which case you'd probably be wet but why not live dangerously).the other part of the market is an indoor setting inside one of the parking building of PCC. Both market are located 10 minutes slow walk from each other. or there's a little cute shuttle cart that you can ride in the designated spot.Vendors are super super nice and they love to chat with you.Prices are fair, and you can bargain here which for an asian born gay man like me I took that as a challenge. My mother raised me right.The market is organized and clean and all in all a fun place to spend your Sunday morning / afternoon in.Park on the street or in the building. If you arrive early you can park right across the street from the outdoor market.I'm coming tomorrow!!!",TecaCali
50,Great great Flea Market,We've been to quite a number of them in the US and in Europe. Spent a lovey day here searching for treasures...and found quite a few! Its a big market ... There is something for everyone! Get there early...pay only $2 for parking (put ur receipt on the dash) and start shopping. Restrooms are indoors..no portojohns yes!,CatXOXu
50,One of the best flea markets in CA,"We've been to MANY flea markets around CA & this is our fav'. There's an outdoor & indoor areas so you can enjoy the sun or scape inside for some cool shade. Inside there are many vinyl records sellers so my man could spend hours there. For me - glassware, vintage furniture & jewlery, old postcards, sunglasss..you can buy water & food at stands there (nothing fancy) but sometimes, one of the best ice-cream truck gets there - Coolhaus. They also host dogs from the Pasadena shelter so you can go ive the dos some love & donate. I think this market is great b/c it's free + it's the perfect size - the Rose Bowel is too big & crowded & we never find good things. This one is BIG but not overwhelming. After the market we would sometimes o to eat at Island's close by (fish tacos & endless fries),at Porto's at Glendale or one of the Korean places in Koreatown.",Chokocat
50,PCC Flea Market wonderful,"I used to sell at shows in the Chicago area, and I have love PCC for 30 years. I will wear some jewelry or have something in my home and somebody will ask where did you get that? Oops, I got it at PCC. Sometimes I cannot believe my treasures. My grandsons come from Phoenix just to go to the Flea market. They love it, my daughter-in-law who has great taste has bought designer clothes here, my niece thought she had died and gone to heaven. Do I love this place? Yes, I use it as a reward!",Bj L
50,Great Variety Of Things!,"I have been wanting to come here forever! I finally just decided to go. It was a super HOT summer day. We parked for $2.00! Looked outside all around and I found a beautiful necklace, good price! Then I had no idea there was another area. Luckily it was in the parking garage (much cooler). WOW! I found some great dresses I could wear for Halloween (Mini Pearl). I bought a cool Beatles poster for $5.00. If I had more $ on me I'd be there all day. What a great experience I had. I will for sure go back again! People were willing to bargain too.",tomjonesCalifornia
50,Surprisingly wonderful experience,"My friend works at this flea market. I had gone to visit her and I stopped by the flea market (I love flea markets) and I was surprise how big this one is... loved it ! I wish I could've bought stuff (live in OH), I'd have bought so much, but I couldn't take it with me on the plane. So, I saw a lot of cool stuff. Only made me wish I could live in Pasadena even more than I do now. Love CA although I don't love the price to live there. LOL. Fun time though.",WickedCakes
10,First Impressions Were Not Good,"I made it a point to check out this flea market at the beginning of March. My friend and I were visiting LA for a week, having never been before. We took the red line from hollywood to union and transferred to the gold line where we took the train to the proper stop in Pasadena. Let me tell you it ended up being a really long commute. From the train station, we ended up having to walk several blocks up and over to finally arrive at the college. I was excited as I was hoping to search through hundreds of vendors for something special. I was sorely disappointed. When we arrived around noon, the parking lot was dotted with a small handful of vendors, apparently many had not come or had left early as there was a threat of rain all day. So what was supposed to be a fun day spending hours perusing the stands, ended up taking us maybe 30 minutes to get through with nothing to show at the end. What a waste of a day and time. I felt bad for dragging my friend with me to this part of town, only to have to turn and walk the long road back to the metro station. I guess we came on an ""off"" day but it still doesn't make me feel any better about going.",honeydrop
50,Old School Flea Market,"As much as I love the Rose Bowl flea market, it can seem overwhelming. Pasadena is lucky to have a smaller and free alternative. The Pasadena City College Flea Market is a great place to find treasures. I probably have found as many excellent things there as I have at the Rose Bowl. It seems less commercial and frankly less pricey.",Antoinette2009
50,The best flea market ever!!,"While planning a month-long trip to the west coast of the USA from England, my 15-year old son stated that he wanted to visit a flea market. We researched and found that the Pasadena Flea was on while we were staying in Santa Monica, so we decided to pay a Sunday morning visit.The parking was easy and the flea market was immense!! As well as a very nice section outside, there were literally hundreds of stall inside the multi-storey car park. This was excellent in two ways, as it was raining when we arrived, so we could keep dry, then the temperature rose to 96 degrees, so we could keep cool.There were so many antique and collectable stalls of all types that I could easily have spent a week there. There were also lots of food stalls selling cakes, sandwiches, drinks and ices.If you like flea markets, you must not miss this one.",DaveOfHockley
40,Pasadena City College Flea Market,"Wide variety, clean, organized. Ample parking. Did not have much fresh fruit or vegetables. Mostly goods.",Livelifepositive
50,Excellent flea ...,"Hundreds of vendors in a concentrated area. Majority of vendors located in a multilevel garage, selling just about everything. If you're a record (vinyl) collector, there are several vendors selling them. Outside vendors are on two different sides of parking lot. This flea mkt. Is a fun place, easy to find, and plenty of parking. Hope this helps you.",FLworldwanderer
50,One of the Best Flea Markets in LA Area,"This flea market takes place the first Sunday of each month. Admission is free. Parking is $2.00This market is ample in size and will keep you busy for hours and hours. It is not as overwhelming as the Rose Bowl flea market. Some vendors sell at both places. Sometimes it seems you can find better deals at PCC. There are two open air lots and also a few floors of vendors selling inside one of PCC's parking garages. You'll find all sorts of vintage goods here. Trust me, over the years I have scored lots and lots of goodies. Treasures range from clothing, bric a brac, fine art, toys, cookbooks. Some people go as early as 5am to have first look. You can also come at 9am and find plenty! Have fun. Also, in one of the open lots (the larger one near the garage) there is this family always selling homemade cakes out of aluminum trays. $3 a slice and some of the best cakes you'll EVER eat!!",Nancy D
50,San Gabriel Valleys best flea market,"A great way to send a Sunday once a month. The flea market takes place on the first Sunday of every month. You'll find antiques, collect all, junk, new items, clothing, furniture, and more. Go prepared for the crowds, but don't worry everyone is very friendly and helpful. Bargaining skills will be honed when you find that something you just must take home with you. Don't forget to dig around in the boxes, piles, and bins a treasure might be found. Food alley also available, if you don't find your meal try across the street from the college where a nice variety can be found. Summer visit, wear a hat, sun screen, and bring water.",Patricia W
50,Lots of bargain,"Great way to spend a weekend morning; antiques, craft items and great bargains.i purchased beach glass necklaces in three colors for 7 bucks a piece- identical to one my husband purchased in Laguna for 24 bucks. Art, shabby chic furniture and nice people.",lascola
