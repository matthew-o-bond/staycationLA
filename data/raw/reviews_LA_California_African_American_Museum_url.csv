40,Great history of California,"Visited the CAAM in April 2019. They had a few very interesting exhibits from African American artists. What I enjoyed most was ""The Liberator: Chronicling Black Los Angeles, 1900-1914. Had the old newspaper press, and reports of accomplishments, etc. of Black Los Angeles. Also the history from slavery 1848-1865.Well put together, very nice staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franmarie20
50,Many striking themes,"LA Blacksmith was the first art works we viewed and very impressive they are. Depicting figures in various undertakings, including one carrying a load on his head, they illustrate many aspects of life. High Frequency Apparatus by Kendell Carter shows a golden sowing machine.Roy Ferdinand's Coloured Waiting portrays a forlorn looking man waiting at a bus station. Numerous pieces depict modern life. New York by Jimmy Lee Sudduth and Sam Doyle's St. Helena's Black Merry Go Rond are engaging, as are a selection of other paintings.Critter by Robert Howell and Dominique Moody's Ancestral Praise House are great mixed media creations.Hip Hop Commercialisation was a further exhibit. Apropos the same, a video of some presentations was being recorded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Adia Millet Exhibit,We went to the Adia Millet Exhibit this weekend. Met the artist and my son participated in the children’s workshop. Beautiful Exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kgo669
20,Poor.... Wouldn't go again,"I was in the area and thought it would be a good place to visit to look at the exhibits... Was not impressed by the people working there, was treated rudely and different to the other people at the front desk... I am not of American African heritage but didn't feel welcome and left shortly after... Shame as the point of the museum is lost on the people that work there... 2 stars for the exhibits and building otherwise it would of been 0...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanessex2018
40,Visit on MLK day,"Came to visit the the museum at 11am on Martin Luther King Holiday. There was extra activity, with guest speakers, a DJ outside, and food trucks. There were some art activities for children.Of the regular exhibits, I enjoyed the sections on MLK's rally at Wrigley field in Los Angeles, and the one on California and slavery. I was less interested in the art exhibits.If this was a regular museum day, I would not bring my child, as there was little of interest to him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Loved this museum! Exceeded all expectations.,"A great museum is one that gives you a new perspective or teaches you things you didn’t know. This was the case in my visit to this museum.Great exhibit on Dr King and his visit to LA. Didn’t know the significance of this chapter until this visit. I learned how he leveraged the relationships he had with famous celebrities such as Sammy Davis Jr. and so many others. He was brilliant in getting support from those who might not be as obvious a supporter.Amazing exhibit on slavery in California. Being admitted as a free state, it didn’t seem that California was very impacted by slavery. The exhibit showed the intersection of the new state of CA with the passing of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. There was a huge impact on CA.One of the most imperative sections was where visitors woul mark down their thoughts. A lot of key insights about the view of the world.Definitely visit if you are able.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanieC
50,Wonderful hidden gem,The African American museum is located in Exposition Park near the Natural History Museum. Admission is free. The museum usually has art exhibits and history exhibits. When I went they had some wonderful artists I had never seen before. The historic exhibits were interesting . One was about slavery in Ca. A round civil war time. Really good historical photos and commentary. This museum rarely disappoints. The USC/Metro stop leaves you very close. Well worth the trip. Truly a hidden gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
50,Celebrating Black California,I really enjoyed visiting this free museum. They had some great art exhibits from various artist and I was really impressed with the layout and structure.The most interesting exhibit was the Gold Rush and how black and mulattos played apart in the development of what’s now Los Angeles.If you have an hour or so I recommend visit the CAAM.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitflyfellow
40,Excellent Exhibits,This place was recommended by the people that work at the Museum Of African American Art. It is a fairly large museum with a lot of exhibits. It has a lot of art and also shows a lot of African American history. Not many of these types of museums in the US. This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in Los Angeles. The people here are friendly and helpful and will get you started on your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Unexpected Pleasures,"After living here all these years finally took the opportunity to visit this museum. Why did I wait so long? It is a real jewel. Loved the showcase exhibits of specific artists. Lots of variety of use of mediums. Especially loved the History of Gospel in LA. One big room with displays, audio samples and videos. It was very informative and highlighted so many of the great and their relationship to Los Angeles. Highly recommend a visit to anyone passing by. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ront590
50,Joining The Tamborine Crew!,The CAAM has a collection of events all around theire current exhibit Gospel Music and such. I joined book club meeting took place on the last Sunday of the quarter. My intention was to could not find the book and went any way. Was a delight it was to hear about the book Tamborines of Glory from a group of women who had read the book. I might try to join other book clubs if they are that enlightening. I think CAAM for always drawing me into learn more thru a variety of methods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/just910
50,CAAM a great place to visit,"California African-American Museum or CAAM or it is also known is located in the Expo Park section of Los Angeles. It is part of a complex which includes various museum, the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the newly built L.A. Soccer stadium.CAMM showcases the contributions of African-Americans. The venue is also a popular spot for other programs, symposiums and educational gatherings. I was there for a symposium on gentrification. The event was well organized and very informative.The venue is very easy to access but should you decide to drive your car be prepared to pay $12 for parking. The complex does have restaurants and other accommodations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredyt3
30,Gospel Music,"The gospel music section - depicting the genre’s beginnings and influences on African Americans in the mid to late 1800s - was the only section worth visiting. The compilation of artists and how their artistry influenced and shaped the many current day genres was intensely emotional and very informative. The other exhibits were an embarrassment. It was hard to believe that someone thought some of those “artifacts” were art. There was a section where an artist literally collected trash and created collages, which looked like they had been created by a toddler in art class. In fact I saw a group of kids tugging on the trash bag and playing with the empty water bottles. I am not joking or exaggerating either.There was another “exhibit” that was more of a documentary of some sort. I couldn’t get passed the first 30 seconds because it appeared to be a group of Hispanic kids speaking in Spanish about some cause... which is odd... considering this is supposed to be an homage to African American art. I mean, that would be like going to a Jewish museum and seeing an exhibit on African Americans who have been lynched. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure whatever the Hispanic kids were discussing was probably worthwhile, I just don’t believe this museum was the place for it.The museum is free to the public and operates off of donations. I hope they are able to attract a better quality of “African American art”. Because judging by what I saw, it left a lot to be desired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shatel03
40,Lovely museum,"The current exhibits are extremely interesting, fun and informative in a beautiful open environment. Leave time to visit the rest of the venues in the park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrishS_Traveler
20,Missing history,"I visited the museum and was totally perplexed by the lack of history. The motherland and slavery. Martin and the civil rights movement. Space museum right next to it, but the three black woman that brought our astronauts home....missing. This is Los Angeles , Tom Bradley and LAX. Black inventors. NWA, P Diddy, JZ , and our beloved Tupac and Biggie. MOTOWN , not their. Oh .......and yes .......PRESIDENT BARACK AND FIRST LADY MICHELL are missing too....are you kidding me. People of all races , come here to see our history and to learn of us , as a people. I was severely disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lavoycestarr
20,Disapointing visit,Not what we expected. This museum has six exhibition rooms with all very different content. This is not you ordinary history museum. So you better check the exhibitions on the website before coming to this museum. The best part: free admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariebeukenoot
40,Fascinating exhibitions!,Fascinating Lezley Saar exhibition and interesting one of the history and art of the Chinese Caribbean diaspora. Enjoyed the video clips of artists and their work. Free admission!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahandAndy
50,Small but engaging,I think it's important first to note that this is not a very large museum but it packs a lot in.I was able to catch the exhibition We Wanted a Revolution: Black Women Artists after missing it at the Brooklyn Museum and it was superb! To see an exhibition dedicated to the contributions black women made to art made my heart sing.next door there was also an interesting exhibition on the relationship and influences between Asia and Caribbean.It is well located next to a train stop and free. Only sad thing for me was no gift store.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souljazzblues
10,Where are all of our contributions?,"I have never been so disappointed in a major city cultural museum.I don’t even know why the city even bothered to set up that bare, minimal signigicant boring exhibit. My 8 year old God son wanted me to take him there, and after less than 10 minutes (which is about how long it took to see all of the displays) he said he was bored and wanted to leave. Known of our major contributions were recognized. Nothing about being kings and queens before we were brought over here as slaves,no civil rights struggles, railroad and architectural contributions;ie the capital,the monument etc., no inventors and their inventions, famous writers, doctors/surgeons??? What’s going on here.A major city with all the access it can get from private funding,and all of these millionaires of color out here. This African American museum is shameful and a disgrace. It teaches no one any thing about our people nor help to gain understanding...It’s a major disservice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmogul333
50,Small but mighty,I went for a KCRW event and it was such a small but powerful experience. They had really interesting exhibits about the African American Experience in LA over the decades.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evelilei
30,Interesting installations,This is a free museum located in the Exhibition Park. Not many works of art on display. Most of the rooms were designed to tell a story.After searching for this museum and paying $12 for parking we were verydisappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryla222_13
50,Small exhibition but profound and moving,This centre is free to enter. Staff were friendly. The exhibitions are small but profound and very interesting. I felt a mix of anger and sadness along with disbelief of how African Americans were treated. The story of Rodney King and the enduring riots is given with photos and news footage. Very interesting place. Recommend visiting and doing the trio of Natural History Museum and Science Centre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/206danif
50,Lovely Exhibition Space,"I'd never been, so decided to traipse down to Exposition Park to visit this museum. The staff was lovely and greeted me so nicely as I entered. Only two galleries were open with two contemporary artist's work. I enjoyed checking them out. Nice high ceilings. Entrance is free, but parking is $12.00. On a nice day it is pleasant to walk around the park and maybe take a light lunch at the Science Museum or from a vendor selling snacks by that museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
20,Forgettable and Disappointing,"We made a special effort to take the time and visit the African American Museum. The structure is beautiful, however the exhibits were small and lacking. It would be beneficial to improve the exhibits to maintain this museum. It has the space to be wonderful. It was a disappointment and waste of our time to attend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kzecb40
40,Small size but loads to see,There was 5 seperate exhibits on that we walked through. They were all very interesting and while we had thought the museum would offer more historical information what we found was thought provoking and inspiring. Note that there is no gift shop which was disappointing as some of the exhibits had pieces that if prints were available we would have bought.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulietL164
50,"Contemporary art, and history","We visited the CAAM specifically to see the Genevieve Gaignard exhibit. We were given a warm welcome and information brochures at the main desk. There was an informative guide who explained the exhibit and showed people around. Loved it! We also looked around the permanent exhibits and viewed the (chilling) ""Politics, Race, and Propaganda: The Nazi Olympics"" exhibit. This is an excellent museum for anyone interested in non- mainstream perspectives in art and history. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918reneef
50,A Local Treasure (And Admission is Free)!,"I was in DC earlier this month and I was fortunate enough to be able to visit the National African American Museum of History and Culture. When I returned to L.A. that got me to thinking about CAAM, a museum I haven't visited in years. Much, much smaller in scope it is still well worth checking out. Admission is free also, so you can't beat that!The staff here is friendly and on hand to give you facts and insights about the various exhibitions. I visited this weekend and saw incredible paintings by artists like Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. But my favorite exhibit was the one that focused on the room-like installations and photographs of Genevieve Gaignard. Her influences are John Waters, Diane Arbus and drag culture and that is really reflected in her work. Very kitschy, a tad disturbing, more than a little racially fluid, endlessly fascinating. (If you can't make it to CAAM you should definitely check out her website.)I spent about an hour at the museum the day I went, but I think I'm going to have to make a return visit just to check out Genevieve's exhibit again since I can't get it out of my head. I had never even heard of her before, but I think she's going to be viewed as a major talent so I have CAAM to thank for the discovery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492HappyTraveler
40,KMAs LA Art experie,"I expected something different, maybe a bit of history or something, but what I saw were exhibits by different, I believe California artists. The Artist's exhibits were really awesome and the cellphone interactive experience is a very nice touch. I would definitely recommend attending the exhibitions that are there currently and hope to see more when I get back out to LA again in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenA126
50,In Awe,My family and I stopped by the Museum not knowing what to expect really. I found myself engulfed in the exhibits. The Evolution of Revolution and especially Overton Loyd's exhibit. I found myself examining each and everyone of his works of art. Simply amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keepitcutecass
50,Powerful!,"I expected to like this museum & learn within it, but more happened. I was deeply moved by being here. Absolutely terrific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markian
30,Artastic,"We headed to Expo Park for our museum day in L.A. This is a little boutique more a gallery then museum in the traditional sense of the word. There were 5 exhibitions, the most interesting range of material. We got to see the story of African Jewish people who move to Iran. We got to look at the history of very beginnings of early African American cinema and movies I think out of all of them I had only seen two. The last couple of exhibitions were more art instillations with a little bit of history. I admit There was no staff around I would have liked to chat to someone about some of the pieces but it was very quiet Saturday morning so I did not want to disturb the lady at the front desk.Wonderful spaces and a lovely well put together museum/gallery. It was free and worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineM852
40,Great Museum! Excellent Archives,Visiting this museum was a learning experience. I got plenty of information and it also inspired my creativity. My favorite part of the trip was going into the archives and reading old newspapers from the civil rights era. Interesting to see how much has changed and how much has remained the same.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EssenceM
40,Black Heritage in Exposition Park ...,The CA African American Museum is a part of the fine cluster of museums in Exposition Park and is easily accessed by the LA Metro Aqua / Culver City line. Museum clearly outlines key components of the Civil Rights movement as well as Black history in LA. Great learning experience! ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Worth a stop,"Attended a reception here and visited one of the two exhibit halls. The exhibits change frequently with displays of local, state and national interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AClarke625
40,Interesting,This museum had some good displays of carvings and a lot of history of the civil rights movement with some very good photos and commentary. Has a lot of empty space and empty rooms for additional displays. Had an interesting display on the historic black churches in Los Angeles. Is next door to the California Science Center and the Los Angeles Coliseum and Sports Arena so you can go to see when you are there also. No fee but donations are accepted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimK751
50,Perfect Venue for Receptions,Attended a hosted event honoring a Leader of an organization after hours in the evening. Several hundred guests were present and the museum easily accommodated the guests seated at rounds. Food buffet stations and a bar was set up as well as two bands played--one outside as you arrived and posed for your red carpet photo and one inside. Stage up front made it easy to see all the presentations. The Hollywood sign and other props made the evening festive and the museum allowed all guests to view the exhibits...wonderful facility!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tally4Me
50,Great small museum,Very enjoyable! Not what I expected but it was great. Wonderful art and permanent exhibit. Very interesting visiting exhibit. Sure would have loved if it was bigger!! Oh and it was FREE! We actually went to see Dead Sea Scrolls and noticed the sign for this museum. We decided to go check it out and weren't disappointed !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949nataliek
40,"Small, but worth it","Ok! So it's small, but has a lot of rich history in it. First the attendant sharing information was very knowledgeable. I enjoyed the Light Catchers and the Graffiti exhibit the most. I would have liked a bigger display of the Washington March of 1963. I missed the part about no photography and took quite a few. Was happy to leave a donation at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
50,World Class - Don't Miss this one - and its FREE!,"The California African American Museum is drop dead unbelievable. The quality of the art is world class. The spacious open feeling of the lobby is fabulous. The quality of the presentation of the art in each of the four galleries is fabulous. The the first one called Visibly Invisible is just a knock out. It is all about albinism in Tanzania and in Jamaica and to a lesser degree in the United States. The people are discriminated against because they are albino. It is gripping touching and incredibly informative. The prejudice and literal hacking away of body parts for sale to witch doctors is beyond shocking to learn that this is happening on earth today. Beyond words for sure.The next gallery Curvature: Lines and Shapes is a quite interesting style. Several of my artist friends I would like to come see this one. I will be encouraging them to this location as soon as possible. The art is a bit abstract here for me, but of great quality. I enjoyed it very much.The next gallery show was titled Lookin' Back In Front Of Me had selected pieces of art from the works of Mark Steven Greenfield. He was a director of the Watts Towers Museum Arts Center. Asa supporter of the arts and local artists for decades, his range of work is eye opening and wonderful. The next gallery had even more incredible history and art of Los Angeles. All I can say at this time is that I was overwhelmed at the quality of this gallery and the art therein.Oh yes. It's free. Triple WOW.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
50,A WAY TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN ARTISTS,"doing a selection of the museums of LA. I could be interested to visit and after spending some hours at the Natural History Museum, I was attracted by the next door Californian African American Museum, because the entry was free and the outside aspect of the museum was attractif. Not like going to very Modern Avant Garde typ of museum, this one is very discret and the presentation well done and the quality of the work in exhibition of very high level indeed.It was a very good discovery, with collection presentation but also temporary one. A corner was dedicated to a kind of hommage to the ""Washington March of 1963"". Really a museum to discover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanPierreB722
50,Amazing,"I was very pleased by the art and information this museum presented. They actually have old video playing.Impressive ,however this is not a kid friendly place ( 2-4yrs) my children were with me. The 4 year found some things interested but he didn't know what they were and the 2 yr old was pulling me out the door from the moment I went in. It's small but I would suggest if you have a small child with you put them in a small stroller.Otherwise enjoy. Oh and it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allathaf
40,Not what I was expecting,I was pleasantly surprised by the displays here. I expected to see the typical history of African Americans and instead was treated to find displays by various artists and historically significant business people. While the museum is rather small the displays were well done and very informational. I was there with a local who was surprised by how the displays had changed so it sounds like the do a good job keeping it fresh.The is no admission cost (donations accepted). The cost to park is $10 which I thought was very reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s0krm0m
30,Small and a little strange,"Park at exposition park and you can see this, NHM and the Science Center for $10 , which I saw as a bargain. Admission to the CAAM is free and the front desk was helpful and knowledgeable. She was highly praising the room with art by untrained artists. That art was depressing and not very good. The Civil War exhibit was great and the room with the biggest AA owned company was interesting. There was an exhibit about the anniversary of the march on Washington, it was ok, but I could have put that together. The thing that upset me was that you could not take photos, and I would have liked to take pictures of the trash art on the walls. They could have done so much more with this space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coutterhill
40,Low key museum,"We stopped by this museum after spending an hour with the crowds at the neighboring Science Museum and found this to be a very nice change of pace. It is not a large museum, can be seen in an hour. The exhibits were on civil war soldiers, the first african-american insurance company from LA which was very interesting, a movie on the march on DC, and several art displays. The staff was wonderful and all in all a very nice museum. There is no admission charge but parking in Exposition Park is $10. Afterwards, we went across the street to have lunch at Philly Cheesesteak and they told us next time thru, to have lunch there first, and then we could leave the car there and walk over. We will do this as being from Philly, we found this to be very close to a true Philly cheesesteak.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
40,Nice Museum,"The art on exhibit when I visited was great. It's a well-lit spacious, but small, museum. Each room was dedicated to a different exhibit. I found most of the exhibits to be informative. There were info. books to reference while touring the museum. The staff were nice and welcoming and seemed to be knowledgeable about the artists. I think it's a great place to take young and seasoned folks alike. It's in a seemingly nice area located near the University downtown and other museums/attractions. Parking was easy (on street metered) and close by. Avoid the gated lots b/c the cost just isn't worth it. Try to find on-street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerz609
40,Visit and discover new artistic work.,"Stopped in, staff very pleasant and helpful. You will find its small but worthwhile. Lots to see and learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23vacationtime
50,"Great art, great people, located near other great museums","I just got back from visiting this place and I was so happy that I took the time to visit this wonderful museum. The people working there are so nice and so helpful. Right now, there is an exhibit for an AMAZING artist - Lois Mailou Jones. Look her up online then go see her stuff in person - she is as good as any master painter you read about in art books.It's by donation and it's $10 to park but you have access to all the other fun things in the same complex - California Science Center, The Natural History Museum, an amazing Rose Garden that can make you feel like you are out of the city for a little bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supergirl
50,Just wonderful!,"The ""CAAM"" (as they call it) is an undiscovered gem. I visited it as an afterthought after visiting the nearby Science Museum and Natural History Museum.This is a traditional museum with art work, exhibits and lots of walking slowly from one item on the wall to the next item on the wall. Sounds boring? Well it probably IS boring if you're a child, and I can't recommend CAAM if you have children.I have to say that I found CAAM one of the most intellectually engaging and well presented museums I have been to in a long time. In this age of museums that are ""interactive"" this is simply a place with a story to tell, and it does and excellent job!If you're going to the nearby Science Museum or Natural History Museum it would be a shame to miss this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/air4ce
50,Great museum,Some times you're not sure what you will find when you visit a free museum but this one was excellent! We enjoyed each exhibit they had and even found a new artist that I loved! We enjoyed this museum so much we made sure to leave a donation because it was better than the museums that we went to that charged admission. If you find yourself in Expo park this museum is a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilihurdler5
50,"Wonderful art in great space, plus parking","The California African American Museum at 600 State Drive in Exposition Park, Los Angeles presents paintings and other works of art by African American artists. We visited the special exhibit ""Places of Validation"" which shows until April 1, 2012, an intriguing selection of beautiful works very well presented. The staff is especially welcoming and knowledgeable. The space is in a modern building whose design and flow makes it easy for the visitor to see a lot in a short time. Parking is available nearby. Budget-friendly restaurants are across the street or in the nearby California Science Center or the Natural History Museum (also great places for kids) . If you're museum-hopping, check out the Fisher Museum on the USC campus across Exposition Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Historian08
