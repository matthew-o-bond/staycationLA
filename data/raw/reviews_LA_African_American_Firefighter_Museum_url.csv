50,Great stop - must-see in DTLA!,"Really enjoying visiting this museum. The docent who toured us around was a former firefighter who was able to share many personal stories - definitely not a boring museum visit. I so appreciated the opportunity to broaden my understanding of the civil rights movement in LA, through the story of these firefighters.If you're in the area, definitely stop in! It's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alimerkl
50,African American History in Los Angeles,"My son picked this museum for our weekend adventure. He has the Passport 2 History book and chose this museum. We are not African American but we got to learn about the accomplishments of those who served in the fire service past and present. Our Tour guide Jimmy was awesome he not only made the history come alive for my son and us but was able to give us personal insight to the challenges they faced. We learned about Firefighters helmets, equipment and tools. My son was excited to receive another stamp in his passport and since we were the only people on the tour we felt like we got the VIP tour. Everyone that was there were very warm and welcoming to us nothing but smiles and handshakes from those there. I totally recommend the museum to everyone especially kids.They even had a piece of steel from the World Trade Center.I am pretty sure Jimmy would be sore if I failed to mention they rent the museum out for private events such as corporate meetings, weddings, retirement parties, Birthday parties, Bar mitzvah's, divorce parties, engagement parties.Lastly I wish him and Maxine the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
