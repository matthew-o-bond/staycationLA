50,Restaurant row and shopping,"Lake Ave was once the shopping center area for Pasadena. With Macy’s still located in the center in one of the most beautiful architectural buildings of its time, the avenue has become more of a restaurant row. From several fine dinning experiences to fast food and everything in between. Duper’s is even open 24 hours a day! They have trending bars with a good night life too. Just drive down and enjoy yourself.",KenPa24

30,Some of the Luster is Gone,"Lake Avenue has lost some of its edge, but there are still places worth visiting. (The restoration of the Macy's store a few years ago makes it something to see.) There are also some good restaurants, including Celestino and Smitty's -- two longtime venues that are reliably good. New stores and restaurants are also opening regularly, so you're sure to find something you'll like.",RoseCityTraveler626

30,Why is this listed as an attraction?,"Lake Street, near where I am staying, is a wide commercial street on the east side of Pasadena. Lots of stores of a practical nature but not a darn thing that would qualify it for listing on Trip Advisor that I've been able to see. Pasadena is a nice spot but don't put Lake Ave on your 'to-do"" list unless you need groceries at Ralphs.",waldentenn
50,Shopping & Dining on Lovely Lake Avenue,"It's all here on beautiful Lake Avenue. Shopping, dining, coffee and tea houses with led-lit trees along the busy street's median strip. Park within one of the parking garages or lots, and explore all the options Lake Avenue has to offer.",Kim G
30,Faded Glory,"Lake Avenue was, at one time, one of the finer shopping districts in greater Las Angeles. No more. A decent Macy's now occupies the wonderful old Bullock's building. The I.

50,"An eclectic, chic collection of shops and restaurants","I have visited here twice in the past two years, and have enjoyed both visits. We dined at Paul Martin's American Grill for dinner both times, a restaurant that kind of typifies the other businesses in the area (modern, trendy).Many upscale, contemporary restaurants and cafes on this street between Route 66 and California Blvd. There's a Yogurt Land Frozen Yogurt store (which has great frozen yogurt), along with other numerous venues for shopping. One area, back behind Lake Ave., had a courtyard with about a half dozen small, intriguing, specialty retailers, cafes, and restaurants. We found a small galleria that housed some unusual retailers (lingerie shop, and some type of fitness center).You easily could spend an entire day here. No shortage of attractions and sights that will captivate your interest and taste buds.I strongly recommend coming here for a pleasant experience if you are in the area.",Disco_Man57

Vintage luxury department store location for the Macy’s makes a beautiful shopping environment. Enjoy the restored wood trim details from when the store was a Bullocks (?) back in the day. Many upscale and casual restaurants on Lake for a quick break, as well as an attractive courtyard area adjacent to Macy’s with umbrellas and seating for relaxing.",Francofile1

40,Shopping and restaurant row,"In the late 1940s, construction of Bullock's Pasadena department store, began the development of South Lake Avenue as Pasadena's premier shopping area. In more recent years, things have changed, with the development of other shopping malls. Bullock's is now Macy's and many of the other upscale shops have changed, so it now has a much more mixed level of stores. Along the street, many restaurants have been added, which makes it an appealing destination.",Joseph H

50,The epicenter of Old Pasadena!,"As someone else wrote so well. This is a dividing line between Old Pasadena in the west part from the post WWII housing in the east.

From its start at the beginning the transformation of Oak Knoll in San Marino.All the way up to the base of the Mountains. Where one can on a clear day see almost all the way to the Palisades and the ocean. I recommend taking the time and effort to do so.It is a collect of shops and restaurants past and present. Like Henshaw, Bullocks and other place now long gone.I also do really so miss Burger Continental. Which was closed because of the nearsightedness of City Government. It was the cultural mecca for me and also most of the population of Cal Tech.BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, it is here that where I met the Boss for the first time and its been happiness ever sense for me.",David L
