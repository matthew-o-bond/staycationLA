50,Wow!,"I am a fire ""buff"", so this museum was an absolute ""must see"". The rigs and fire equipment are absolutely fabulous! What a thrill to see ALL of the rigs used in the TV series Emergency!. The museum staff personnel were terrific. If you're in Southern California and enjoy the history of the fire service, visit this museum. It's better than you think it is!",Bill H
50,Great place to have a party,My Boss had her Daughters Quincenera (no idea how to spell it) here and it was just gorgeous. A lot of neat old firetrucks and some photos and stories all around the actual Museum but not a lot to see or do there but the upstairs banquet area is huge and great for entertaining when you have an event but it is quite costly to rent it for an evening. I think I could make a years worth of house payments for what it costs an evening. But it is lovely.,lilrunaway45
50,Interesting and enjoyable,We spent about an hour at this small museum and enjoyed it enough that we will likely be back. The docent was friendly and very knowledgable. We learned a good deal of interesting history and got to see some beautifully restored fire fighting equipment.,IVAN H
40,Great place for kids,OLD relics of fire engines restored. People to tell you stories about the history. Very light and airy.,barbcatw
50,New Place Showcasing the Home of Engine and Squad 51,"The Los Angeles County Fire Museum recently moved right around the corner from their old warehouse facility to a brand new Museum facility in July of 2018. This place is more spacious allowing for more organized displays. Apparatus from the show ""Emergency!"" are the show piece of this museum. The Museum organization restored the original Engine 51 and Squad 51 vehicles and are prominently on display. Other displays include historical Los Angeles County Fire Department vehicles and a couple of photo ops. If you are into the show ""Emergency!"" or are into Fire Departments, Fire Engines, this will be the place for you. It's about a 15-20 minute visit depending on how many people are there. Definitely a nice place to visit and pay homage to the heroes of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.",gcfam79
50,Opening Day of new Museum,"What a fantastic Museum.......showcased Squad 51 and Engine 51 and TV show “Emergency” actors on big Opening Day. Great street vendors, demonstrations of Jaws of Life, antique engines, Bagpipe and Drum Corps, etc. All folks and kids interested in the fire service or the show MUST visit. You won’t be disappointed!",HorseyJan
40,Station 51......... And others!,"If you like old fire engines, especially the ones from the television show emergency, you have to stop by and check out this little gem in Bellflower. Who would of thought? The new museum will be opening on July 14, 2018, which means I have to head back to see the rest of the collection (which was closed) till the grand opening. A must see for the fire department, old fire trucks or even television fans of the show.",esethebomb
40,Fun place to take the kids,If you enjoy history and seeing fire equipment then this is a good place to take kids. They are moving to a new place in the near future which should make it better,Phillip H
50,Lots of fun and a great visit,Lucky to get a private tour of the museum. The museum is open to the public the first Saturday of the month. Many items to see including the famous squad and engines from the TV show Emergency! Lots of fun and lots of history.,mpicchioldi
50,Emergency! vehciles,"If your a fan of the tv show Emergency!, this is your place! The squad and both engines are here and in excellent shape. There are many other engines as well, including several steam fire engines. The restoration skills are incredible! And let's not forget the history.. The staff are well informed and many are current LA County Firefighters. They provide a great tour with information and lots of fun! Don't leave without giving a small donation and buying a hat! The new museum should open in about a year and we can't wait to see it!",Bob D
50,Lots of information,"Gil gave us a private tour, much appreciated. A must see, the story about 911 is a wow moment. Not just about the tv series ""Emergency"" but about the history of the LA fire department and their history",ronwiebe67
50,In Squad we trust.,"The museum is open the first Saturday of the month.It is free to enter and is quite literally a large garage housing a small part of the county's collection of fire engines. Nothing more, nothing less. There is no cafe, just a small counter that serves as a small gift shop.At it's heart though, is Squad 51.If you don't understand the importance of the squad, then the museum is not for you.The moment I walked in I saw it and I was taken back to my youth of the early 70's when my life was dominated by ""Emergency!"" a TV drama that revolved around the firemen of station 51 and in particular, Squad 51.On our visit, several members of the museum were present, and we enjoyed a long chat with one who is also a serving firefighter with LA County. It was great. The highlight of my trip to California.The museum is building a new location to house it's collection and I happily parted with twenty dollars to help it along.",Phil da Greek
40,Squad 51!,"This place is AMAZING when it comes to the apparatus displays from the Los Angeles County Fire Department's history. The best part for me was the actual vehicles from EMERGENCY! To see the actual Squad 51 and the original Ward LaFrance 51 was so amazing. This I would have to say is there main exhibits. The Squad is autographed by Kevin Tighe and Randolph Mantooth. You will also see one of the ambulances used for the show as well. It was such a great place to visit!! Recommend it to TV History buffs and Fire Department buffs!!! Just a heads up though, the facility is not that big, I know that there are plans for expansion but again, if you are in Fire Department History and TV History, the size of the facility won't matter, it's what is in side that does!!",gcfam79
40,Memory Lane,This place takes me back to the good ol times when tv was great and now you can walk us close to the cars and trucks for a pic. It's really nice to see that someone has taken there time to let you see the squad 51 up close and in person. Can't wait to go back and see what's new.,mikkie2003
50,"Great displays, amazing staff","I was able to visit on a day normally closed by arranging in advance and had the pleasure of being there with 3 of the museums members. The displays are rich in history and well looked after, let alone incredibly well refurbished. The history of the displays is interesting in itself and they also have a small room with static displays of equipment etc. they are looking to expand to a new purpose built building in the future, so be sure to leave a donation to help make this place even better than what it is!I will definitely be looking to return when I can!",dannyfraser
50,"Awesome place, awesome tour, awesome staff!","We contacted the museum before our trip and arranged for a tour as they are currently only open the first Saturday of each month. Joe Woyjeck, the Vice President of the Fire Museum, gave us the tour and we really appreciated it. Joe was great and showed us around, giving great detail on each vehicle. He provided a lot of history on the vehicles, the museum and his own life as a firefighter. You'll come to see the vehicles from the Emergency TV show, but you'll stay for the rest of it. Highly recommended if you're into fire fighter museums!",Keith G
50,"""Sqaud 51, where are you""??",An entertaining venue for people of all ages. You can take a photo of the real equipment from the TV program and other historic fire equipment from generations ago! Reserve the venue for a special party or event. Talk to Captain Joe--everyone's friend!!,Q9539TLrandyb
40,Emergency! Pilgrimage,"The museum is the place where Squad 51 and Engine 51 from the 70s show Emergency! are housed. As a fan of the show back in the day and with a renewed interest from watching episodes on Netflix, it was exciting to see the vehicles up close. But there was much more to see at the museum than just the Emergency! vehicles. The museum also restores and displays historic firefighting equipment which was very interesting. Foe example, they had a horse-drawn pumper from Knottsberry Farm and a vintage vehicle that had been used at Disneyland in parades. The staff were very knowledgeable about each piece. The museum is only open on the first Saturday of each month from 10-2.",Bence B
10,"Not a place to go to dring craft beer, Food tastes like Bad food truck products","Terrible food, terrible service, Only one craft beer menu, and beer taps not labeled so takes for ever to order a drink,as bar staff have no idea of what they are selling",Michael B
40,"If you like fire engines, this place is for you.","This museum is only open the first Saturday of the month. My husband and I went this week with our two grandchildren aged 2 and 4. Our grandson, the 4 year old, who loves fire engines was just totally enthralled. We were fortunate to have the historian, Retired Captain Dave Boucher, LACoFD, as our guide. He knows everything about each rig that is on exhibit and those getting ready. For a small museum, there is a lot to see and learn. There is a small memorial to 9/11 and a memorial is being planned for the Granite Mountain Hotshot Firefighters who lost their lives on June 30, 2013. One of those young men used to volunteer at this museum. If you are in the Los Angeles/Long Beach area, try to make the time to visit this museum. There are several dining choices just down the block from the museum. No admission is required, but donations are appreciated.",Mary S
