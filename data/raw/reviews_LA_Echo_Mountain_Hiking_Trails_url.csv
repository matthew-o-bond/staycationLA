50,Amazing views!,Strenuous hike and worth all the sweat. I love coming up here to enjoy the view. This place never gets old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcworks
50,Great hike close to home!,I've always loved hiking on this trail! It's close to home and very accessible. The view is fantastic on top and challenging even with the distance because of ascent and descent! Would recommend this to any hikers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eleven16mb
50,Postcards don't do this trail justice,"This is the old Mt. Lowe railway right of way. It climbs from 1,600' to 6'500 ft in over 5 miles. Must be seen on a clear day for views to the sea or on a clear night for a sea of city lights. Yes, you can camp overnight but remember that the temps can drop rapidly. Bring lots of water. You can backdoor Mt Wilson in the same day if you chose.Google Mt Lowe trail for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
40,"Good exercise, goo views, good history","A very popular hike! Peak times can remind one of a freeway! The trail is well trod, well maintained because of that, easy to find at the top of Lake Avenue in Altadena. It is 2.5 miles one way. The trail is mostly in the sun, so most people tackle this in the early part of the day. It is relentlessly uphill. There are no facilities: no water, no restrooms, no nothing. But what do you get in return? Really good exercise, wonderful views of the cities of Pasadena and Los Angeles, and on clear days all the way to the ocean. At the top are the ruins of an abandoned hotel, and other trails linking you to many further adventures in the San Gabriel Mountains. Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkane8
40,(Lower) Echo Mountain via Sam Merrill Trail,"To find this trail, take Lake Ave all the way up to Loma Alta. At this intersection, you will reach the old Cobb Estate on the right and the Sam Merrill Trailhead. The (Lower) Echo Mountain via Sam Merrill Trail is a 5.5 mile out and back trail. The first 2 1⁄2-miles are directly up to Echo Mountain and the ruins of a resort and the Mount Lowe Railway, via a well-maintained trail and some switchbacks. This trail is rated as moderate but in my opinion, and experience, this hike is doable for most people. The trail is open year-round and (leashed) dogs are okay to use the trail. Also okay are mountain bikes! For this reason, and because it's such a popular trail (heavily trafficked) you need to be very careful. On a clear day, the end is a beautiful viewpoint and a great reward. If you are looking for a locals hike and a good workout, and a photo (selfie) opp above the City of Angels then this is one that you will enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,Great Hike and Great Views,"Bring plenty of water, you will need it all the way up , especially on a warm day. This is the moderate hike with lots of switch backs all the way to the top. Bring an energy bar in case you are hungry in the middle of the hike. Sunset is incredibly beautiful and early morning hike is a great time to avoid the crowds. The path is a bit narrow so watch your step and wear sturdy hiking shoes .Top of the mountain has an amazing view and the ruins of the old Mt Lowe hotel . We did not reach to the top the first time since we thought it was a easy hike and did not bring enough water. We reached to the top the second time after bringing plenty of water and snacks. Trail head is at the Cobb Estate front iron gate entrance. Park your car on the street. Downhill hike is fast and easy. We enjoy hiking this trail and have hiked here 5 times already. Well worth the drive to enjoy this great hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandC0218
50,Great hiking trails,"We started up the west trail, and found it to be pretty steep...since it had rained the day before, some of the ground was soft so we hiked back down and took the east trail. This trail was fairly easy to navigate, involving a number of switch backs. Great views of the valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BLtrvl
