20,Poor service,"I’ve been going to Spa Pura for 5 years. The location is convenient and massage therapists are good. However, I will not return.I bought a gift card for my husband for Christmas and booked a 90 min massage for him using the gift card. At the end of the appointment the front desk staff stated that the gift card only covered a 60 min massage. I said that I had purchased the 90 min massage and that’s what I confirmed when I booked the appointment. The front desk clerk continued to argue that I had to pay extra, which was unprofessional and uncomfortable for everyone. I paid the difference but won’t return to this place. They turned what should’ve been a relaxing day into a stressful and uncomfortable experience.",Katie P
50,Massage,"Had a great deep tissue massage with Jessica. She is super friendly, super professional and I would really recommend her as a therapist.",BarryTineke
50,Always Relaxing,I love this spa. I have had several massages and facials here and have enjoyed every one. Infused water and tea is available in the locker room and waiting room. Prices are very reasonable. My only complaint is that the changing / locker area is too small so I feel rushed to get changed so I'm not in anyone's way.,Cammie P
50,Small & Luxurious: Perfect Place to be Papmered,"I first went to Spa Pura over a year ago. I had a massage w/ Amy and a Korean Body Scrub w/ Cindy.Both were excellent treatments, so much did I enjoy them that I opted for a basic membership... Because I was so happy with my monthly visit, I upped the level of my membership.Spa Pura has very friendly Desk Staff as well as talented & dedicated technicians.The woman's spa has a nice locker area w/ many toiletries for use, a jacuzzi, steam room & dry sauna. The facilities are always pristine and inviting, the steam room steams from the bottom and often, so there is no time for it to get cold.They have an excellent selection of products for sale, as well as a lovely array of photography by a local photographer available for purchase.I look forward to my monthly spa treatment @ Spa Pura, it makes my life just that much more luxurious.",Auntie-Nanuuq
50,I Love Cindy,"Spa Pura is a find. It's hidden in sleepy Montrose, on the second floor of a shopping area. It's well maintained, very clean, not ""luxurious"", but entirely ok. the very best (for me) is the middle-aged Cindy who provides traditional Korean scrubs in the privacy of a wet room. The very very best. Truly. You can't imagine how smooth your skin is when Cindy finishes.",Taosgal
40,"Small on the outside, but big inside","This upscale spa is a nice place to go and relax and have a massage.The therapists will do listen to your requests for deep tissue or lighter pressure. However, I found the massage techniques of therapists to be of an older style and less relieving of muscle issues. I usually have the hot stone massage, so the therapists can really work the muscles but get them warm to relieve the stiffness. The stones were really used in my 90 minutes.Ambiance of Spa Pura is exactly what you would expect from a spa. It is surprising to see in the middle of a small town like Montrose.I will visit again and try additional treatments to see if my next experience is different than the first.",CraigF256
40,Lovely Staff,I have been to this spa multiple times and the staff has always been very pleasant. My masseuse was great!,GCFL12
50,You Have to Try This,"So a good while back, I had a SpaWish credit & I read the reviews, I was dubious... but last year I had a Groupon and I used it here....OMG! Heaven, Cindy, gave me the BEST Korean Body Scrub Ever! I molted more skin than a snake, more skin than I even knew I had to molt! The sensation, wow.So I really don't have much extra for spa dates, but a few weeks back I went in on a fluke after dinner.... Not only did I purchase African Black Soap (my face is glowing & everyday fewer & fewer blotches), but I glombed onto a ""Special: for $69 a month (not charged all at once) I now get my choice of a 60 minute massage or a full Korean Body Scrub for a year! I also have access to the spa facilities M-W all day & night (I do wish they'd extend this to Thursday night as well).I have been in freakin' bad awful pain for the past few months.... I Tweaked my right side pretty badly.... So last night I went in and I had my monthly massage w/ Amy. OMG, she pounded & stretched me to my limits, she used my arnicated lotion, she used hot stones & hot towels.... she even massaged my face. What an angel of healing!This Is Thee Place to go..... Latch onto one of their two specials, you'll be glad you did and it is worth every penny spent!The only conundrum.... do I go have another massage w/ Amy or a Korean Body Scrub w/ Cindy?",Auntie-Nanuuq
