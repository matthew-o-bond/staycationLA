50,Hidden Gem,"The lights and decorations were beautiful. Came for the boat parade. They had a firework show and so many fun things to do. Snow princesses (not any cheap type either) snow and sleds, free glow sticks, and great friendly people. Love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Playinmarinadelrey
50,Many movie and TV shows shoot scenes here...,"Instead of going to Miami, Chace Park fills in. Put the Palm Trees in the background, add the numerous boats, and you are at a Florida murder scene. It is also good on the Fourth of July for viewing fireworks. Traffic is the main problem with more cars that can possibly park and people walking a distance to watch the show, begins at 9 PM. Several new buildings are up and waiting for tenants to occupy them. On some days a bus load of Russians arrives and they walk around, enjoy their adventures at the shore and then bus back to home. Just a nice quiet place for the most part, but I believe it’s prime was a decade ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz
40,Nice park,We went to Burton W. Chace park for the New Years Eve event. The park was decorated beautifully for the event. The Christmas lights were all over the park. The event was well organized and while there was a crowd that came out it was not overcrowded. They had the ball drop from New York City twice to represent both the East and West coast. They had a lot of events for the young ones at the earlier event including a dance floor with a disco. There were food trucks and people selling noise makers and glitter lights for the children. Turned out to be a very nice event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmainD_12

Very close to Lincoln Av. with plenty of parking lot and more important, with breathtaking views specially at sunset time.

50,Great place of respite and many great events throughout the year. Special park to escape to for the Marina,"Great summer concert series they put on, spread out over a beautifully manicured park. Great parking availability, too (unless it's for the concert and then it's usually super overcrowded). Its IDEAL to visit it through the Waterbus which you can take from 7 different spots throughout the entire Marina. I like to take the Waterbus (like a water taxi for just $1 a ride on the water) from end of Bora Bora Way and then go to the Park for the concert and return back via watertaxi (or to Fisherman's Village, too). Marina is filled with such nurturing places to walk, relax and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274LynnR
30,Small Park on The Marina,"One of the finger harbors that juts out into the Marina. LA County apparently runs this location and so there is usually an attendant on site. There are a series of parking areas here, especially useful if an event is taking place. some picnic sites available. Seals maintain a presence on the wharf area. When I was here there were mostly mothers with children and dog walkers present. Good stop for cyclists or joggers using the bike trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti

No street parking and no parking at local shopping areas as they will tow you.

50,July 4th Fireworks,"It has become our family tradition to attend the fireworks show here. It is on a hill overlooking the marina with great views. Fireworks are fired from a barge off shore. Big crowd, parking is a beast, and leaving can take twice as long as show but it's still worth it.Eclectic crowd with families, pets, BBQ S, vendors, music, and of course fireworks.

40,Walkable With a View,For a city part it's a good size and you can't really beat the view from any angle as the part juts out into the marina. During certain times of year the sea lions sun themselves on a few of the floating docks and you can even hear them barking outside the park from time to time. There are quite a few picnic tables and covered areas for groups but it looks like you have to reserve them in advance. Otherwise there are some nice benches from which you can watch the boats sail in and out of the marina at the end of the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougG1130
40,Peaceful Park by the Sea,"Hidden gem in the Marina such a peaceful park. The view is spectacular with hundreds of ships from big yachts to sail boats see them glide by so majestically. The park has walking paths along the water and can see boats in there slip to crews practicing there 2 person to 8 person rowing boats. Such quiet beauty to share with some one special or family with children to have a picnic on hill side looking above the water or under roof with tables to barbecue.

Next year, I'd pick a place higher on the hill so people can't block you We also came here for some of the summer concerts... it's a fun little place on the marina.

50,Beautiful park,"Visited the park during November 2016, which is out of season, so it was very quiet. The park is very well kempt with ample seating throughout, including views over the marina.

There is designated areas for dog walking.This is a great place to visit and whilst it was very quiet during our visit I'm sure that it is a popular attraction in season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A245IRdianeg

40,"Great park on the water, terrible parking!","This park is awesome! It's very large, with a lot of grassy knoll areas, gazebos and park benches. It sits right on the water in the marina. It's a great place to host BBQs, picnics, birthdays, baby showers etc. It's very close to a grocery store and restaurants so convenient for picking up last minute groceries or food for a picnic. The park also hosts amazing free concerts with big acts such as Brian McKnight!Minus one star because the parking lot is way too small for such a large, popular park. I highly suggest taking a cab or Uber if you can, especially on a concert day or weekend summer day,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesarahb

40,Lovely Location Makes This Park Worth Visiting,"We live close to Chace Park and always enjoy walking our dog there. It's nicely maintained, always stays green, offers plenty of good picnic facilities, and attracts a wide variety of visitors. Seals often slip onto the docks adjoining the park to sun themselves, delighting children and adults alike. But because the park is flanked on three sides by water, the views of the boats, wind surfers and pelicans constitute its primary attraction. We never tire of sitting on a bench and watching the sailboats and cabin cruisers pass by in the main channel. Our only complaints are the cost of parking on weekends (it's free during the week) and the less-than-elegant restrooms. Still, a visit to Chace Park is almost sure to please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O7246NNrichardb

A picnic on the top of the hill watching the boats go by on a beautiful day is awesome. There can be ""questionable"" characters hanging out at the picnic tables on a regualr basis but generally they keep to themselves.

There are the great views of the Marina ... Great place to watch a sunset. Many summertime concerts. Lots of wildlife viewing from watching the Pelicans and cormorants fish or enjoying the antics of the sea lions. There are BBQ grills and ample places to lay out a blanket and watch the sailboats.

50,See the Helmsman,"A nice park in the Marina del Rey Harbor. Take a quiet stroll while looking at the sailboats. At the end of the park is the famous Helmsman statue, a statue donated by the Helms Bakery family to the city. Brings back memories of the days of Helm's Bakeries trucks coming by our house daily to deliver bread, cookies, doughnuts, and cream puffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kilimanjaro1
40,Nice Park,We took our pup for a walk around the park. Dogs must be on a leash. Beautiful views. You can picinc there but they also sell refreshments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryh292
40,Fantastic for July 4th!,This is a favorite spot to spend 4th of July with friends. $10 event parking if you get there early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelan5
20,"Nice view, that's about it",Seemed a little rough around the edges. I guess it is a good place to walk your dog if you are a boater docked nearby...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crikenny
40,Nice park and well kept,"It's well kept and a nice park to watch the boats, wildlife, seals and have a picnic. Will go back in the summer months to enjoy it more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pap1973
50,Wonderful Marina Park,"This is a wonderful park to enjoy the scenery. In the summer they have concerts. There are limited numbers of picnic tables and there is a snack shop that is open sometimes. This is not a park to come for numerous sports activities, there are no courts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulu82143
40,Great view of the Marina in small cute park - great for dog walking,"There's nothing to dislike about Burton Chase Park. I grew up in the Venice/Marina Del Rey neighborhood and over the years they have always kept the park up nicely. I'm sure it doesn't hurt that there is a lot of money in the Marina area so their community is kept quite nice. It is not a convenient park to ""just walk to"" unless you are staying in the area- as it is down a road off the main shopping area in the Marina and the park area itself only has two rows of parking so if there is any sort of small party at the park or it's a nice sunny day - you may have to drive back to the shopping area and walk in. But it's the heart of Marina Del Rey, you will enjoy the walk, the park, the shopping :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmchaca
50,"Evening activity for singles, families, kids and lovers","Almost always something going on in the park from afternoon to evening. Our weekend say musical performances by noted pianist and bands and we drove over the first night but found out the water taxi stops regularly there so for $1 each way per person - you can go and get back to your room - with ease. You can walk around while listening, take a towel and sit on the grass, lay around or enjoy food in the early evening sold in the area and kick back and socialize or just soak up the culture in a friendly enviornment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spa-Mainia
50,Beautiful park,"Everytime I go to Chase Park I am amazed at how nice it is. Now that the water shuttles are starting up again, it will be a definite destination spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeWalker
50,Wow what a gem,You know I lived in Venice for years and worked down the street from this park at the Marina City Club. I never even knew that there was such a great park just blocks from my job. It is an excellent location and has clean bathrooms and pavillions to barbeque. Can't wait till take my grandkids there to play. They also have visitor boat slips I have to figure out what that means! I have a boat and would love to moor it as a visitor our next trip to Marina Del Rey!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseM574
40,"Nice seaside park, great for picnics","Summer time they run a water shuttle around Marina del Rey. Some nights you may catch a movie in the park, or just stroll along the marina. Ample parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeP379
40,Oasis at the Marina,Rode my bike to the park and got a great view of the marina and the boats going to the ocean. Quiet place to enjoy the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207Mike
40,Very beautiful with added summer perks!,"It's a very beautiful place to spend a day as you watch the boats in this gorgeous marina. In the summer they have free concerts of noteworthy artists from all over the world. I have seen wedding ceremonies set up there as well. Families and couples will find plenty of room to picnic or just sit back, read and relax. During the summer months the water taxi is available too for $1. You can hop on and see the whole marina or get off at a number of stops like Fisherman's Village for a bite or to rent a boat, or Mothers beach to rent a kayak. Parking is available and reasonable. A very worth while place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie310
50,A primo spot...,... particularly during the week when parking is free and it is uncrowded. Beautiful vegetation and great views of the marina. Picnic tables and barbecues are available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foredeckchick
