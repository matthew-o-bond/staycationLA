50,From George Vreeland Hill,"The Lily Pond was built in 1907, seven years before Beverly Hills became a city.The pond was removed in the 1970s and replaced with grass to make it look more like a park and was rebuilt in time for the Beverly Hills Centennial in 2014.The famous Beverly Hills Sign is a part of the location and visitors from all over the world come to see the sign and the Lily Pond.It is one of the most popular tourist spots in Beverly Hills and California.A photographic dream.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
