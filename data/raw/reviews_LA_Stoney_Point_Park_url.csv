40,A surprise to see,All of a sudden you see it. It seems to come out of nowhere. A bit awe inspiring. Has some parking and is well visited. It's cool to see from the road. You wonder why that is the only place like that around. A landmark. A very cool wonder among the concrete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
50,"A ""Rockin"" place for Climbing, Hiking & Bouldering","A 76 Acre Natural Rock Outcropping east of Topanga Canyon Blvd., just off the 118 Freeway, where boulders merge together to form caves, dens, and alcoves. Approximately 30 miles east of L.A./ HollywoodGreat for Rock Climbing, Bouldering, Photography and Hikes: easy or challenging hikes depending on the direction one chooses. There are trees and shrubs too but mostly it's dominated by the rocks.... the ""Stones""... and you'll see why it named ""Stoney Point"" the moment it comes into view.Likely a good place to Rappel too, but I've never seen that done here.The ""Crag"" that is directly at ground level is a most excellent place to practice and/or to expose children and novices to climbing. Plenty of Jugs, crevices and other holds. Ten feet of the ground and similar to a challenging wall 100 feet high.I took my big ole' dog on his first hike here when he was a young pup, my other young pup, my 6 year old son, on his first rock climb here and have also just hung out and used the environment and changing light to experiment with my cameras.There is a Horseback Riding facility adjacent (Stoney Point Riders), the Reagan Library up the freeway a bit and plenty of street parking right at the edge of the park.Mostly attracts adventurous people who are not idiots, but a few rocks were ""tagged"" last time I was there. But considering how the park is not at all separated form the city, it is impressively clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
