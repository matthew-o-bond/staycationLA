40,Intimate concert venue,"Intimate music venue with a mezzanine and side elevated platforms. Most recently came here to watch Hunny perform, and really enjoyed the show. The security line was short since we arrived pretty late, and you just have to go through metal detectors and scan your tickets (we used the axs app) at the door. Bathrooms are to the immediate right, and it was a very long line for the ladies room. Unfortunately there’s only one bathroom (3 stalls), but on the other hand, there’s two bars (one on the bottom and one upstairs). There’s some tables with chairs to sit in the lounge plus some along the edge of the second level if you don’t want to be down in the pit. Otherwise, for shorter people (like myself) the sides (there’s little steps that you’ll have to take up) provide an elevated view where you’re still on the ground, but might be able to see a bit better.Parking is a miserable situation. You can pay for valet and there’s various lots around. We got lucky and found parking in Wilshire that was free after 8pm, but most of the neighborhoods around are permit-parking. La Brea has some metered spots too, but those were all taken when we looked.The people who work here are standoffish and not that friendly. Note that they don’t sell advance tickets for other shows, and only sell shows in-person for the show that’s playing that very night. The website hadn’t worded it clearly enough, so I was confused about that until I asked (unfortunately Eve 6 was sold out online so I was hoping to see if they had some in-stock at the box office while I was there).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanellesua
50,Perfect Small Show Venue,"The El Rey is a wonderful small venue for bands. Sound was great throughout the house and there were both standing and seated options for the show I saw. The sides are slightly tiered and this is where the seating was to be found. The wait line and security were well organized and attentive (security actually walked the que redirecting will-call to the box office. Having been in more than a few hot boxes for small shows, I was happy to find that their AC worked well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hirunningman
50,Sounds great and not a bad view in the house,"This is one of LA's best venues. It was recently remodeled a few years ago, but they preserved the theater's original look. (Yes, those are glass chandeliers.) It's a good size, the sound is usually top notch, the staff is generally cheery (hey everyone has a bad day, yeah?), and inside it is welcoming and isn't intimidating. There's a smoking area, and the drinks - cost as much as you think they would at a concert venue. It's reasonable, but not cheap.I am short, so having a good view of the stage is important to me and there's really not a bad spot in the house. I usually even stand towards the back!DO NOT bring gum in. It is not allowed. I have probably spent the cost of 5 concert tickets in packs of gum that I've had to throw away because I absentmindedly brought those in.Lastly, if you want to see a show, buy a ticket before hand. Though it might not state ""SOLD OUT"" the morning of the show, chances are if it's a hot ticket, it will sell out by the time the first band goes on. Don't sit on it!*Hollywood note: In the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman movie ""License To Drive"" the El Rey was their destination before grandpa's car gets towed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helloceleste
30,"Pretty Place, Run Badly.","The El Rey Theater is in the Miracle Mile section of Los Angeles. The theater is from the 40's and has been redone and turned into a concert hall and a place that can be rented for weddings and other events. It is just lovely. The outside neon is stunning and the inside is intimate, I think it can hold about 700 people.When you enter there is a large bar that is very pretty. Inside the theater it is all standing room only. There is a stage and the pit/dance area. On the sides is a small step to a carpeted area that does not get as packed as the pit.Right next door is a great place to eat and you can go from the theater into the eatery through a side door and even take items with you into the theater. The owner of the eatery is wonderful.All of the above is great, but sadly, it is unlikely we will ever return to the theater until they get their act together. The El Rey is run, I assume, by Goldenvoice, who does nothing but book concerts so you would think they know what they are doing.We went to see a band Autograf (EDM) in early April. Parking is valet, but valet does not start until after 7 PM and it is likely you are already there in line since it is all general admission. If you can't find street parking, the chances are you will be forced to use their valet service and now you are at the end of a long line.Once you are ready to go in there is the fun of dealing with untrained security. They really aren't too much of a problem. They will wand you etc. and all that is great. What is not great is them standing around while drugs (X etc) are sold right in front of them and right in front of the entrance, but on the sidewalk. What is not great is them allowing people in so drunk they can barely stand. While we were there, we saw all of this. I had my 11 year old grandson with me. He has been to more concerts than most adults. He is never an issue. So, I was not pleased when a security member actually touched me (I guess he thought he needed to make sure I was listening to him) to tell me to ""watch"" my ""kid"" the entire time he was in the theater and make sure to keep a ""constant eye on him."" Now, he was not telling me this because he was concerned about the drugs being sold or the drunks in front of us being let in, without a word said. He was telling me this because for whatever reason he assumed I would allow an 11 year old to run wild, if not for his sage advice. I wonder if he thought grabbing onto my shoulder to tell me how to take care of a child would be at all helpful. That would be the same child that stayed in line, held my hand the entire time in line, and let's see, was not drunk, loud, or selling some of his spare drugs. I did not bother to say anything to him because wasting my time is not something I tend to do. You can tell by tone and tenor when someone is trying to be helpful or kind. This person just does not like kids, too bad, and is scared of the drug dealers, so tries to be a K mart clerk with power to pick on a grandmother with her grandson. Now, I know he was not going to say a word to the dealers because I heard him say he did not want a fight, he also did not want a ""fight"" with the 30 or so people in the front smoking pot. I don't care about any of this. It comes with the concert territory sometimes. That is fine. We know what we are getting into, but don't, and I mean, don't ever grab a grandmother by the shoulder and instruct her on the care of her grandchild. We were in line for a long time so we could not help by hear this person talking to other security guards about not wanting trouble with the dealers and just let it go about the smoking because ""why bother."" Again, I don't care, just don't bother me or mine.The fun inside did not last long. The first band was so loud that we had no choice as did some others but to leave. I know all about loud concerts. We go to them all the time and we always have ear protection, and great ear protection. I am not talking about so loud you can't think straight, I am talking about so loud it is illegal and had a fire marshal been on site the place would have been closed down if the opening act did not turn it down. I have it on tape. I have a great phone. The horrid noise on the video is crackling speakers and the sound up so loud that the sound system can't help but distort everything to just a loud, painful, buzz. People were holding their ears and as some were leaving we were right behind. Even with state of the art ear protection my grandson was holding his ears and wanted out. This would be the same little boy that a week earlier saw Stone Temple Pilots in the front row and screamed, ""One more time"" at the end.There is no seating in the lobby area to wait out the first act and hope for better for the second. There is really not even a place to stand and wait it out. You are left with a choice to leave and not return or do permanent damage to your ears. With all the technology out you would think the El Rey could manage to let people in and out. There are no neighbors to be disturbed, it is on Wilshire and nothing is open near by--nothing, but the great restaurant. But no, you can't do that. You can't even just stand in front, in or out, don't touch that floor because you are out. I had on 3 wristbands. One to allow me into the eatery, one that showed I was over 21 and one that I had no idea what it was for. I had tickets. Now, a dollar hand stamp would work to let the cracker jack security know that you can go in and out. But this is all too confusing for them. In or out, don't step on that floor. We, of course, missed the band we wanted to see, since damaging my grandchild's ears would not please his mother, I don't think. We wasted the ticket, we wasted the money, we were offered nothing, no one told anyone to turn it down. There were at least a dozen people leaving, many complaining and asking why they can't come back later, if they had known, etc. etc.The bathrooms are very small and there is not enough stalls at all. You will be waiting in a very long line.So, Goldenvoice, or whoever runs the El Rey, get it together. The place could be great. Get some professional security, maybe a dollar hand stamp and for the safety of everyone, make sure the sound is within some sort of legal limits, there are hand held machines for that, off to Home Depo you should go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Art Deco LA gem,"El Rey Theater is a great little secret in miracle mile, Los Angeles. It is standing room only and very intimate. I love seeing artists perform here as the it is not a large venue and you have a good view of the stage from pretty much every spot. The venue does not have parking, but there are many parking structures around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karula76
50,Bruce Cockburn at the del Rey,"I read a little bit about the theater on line, but was much more impressed once I got there. Very intimate theater, open seating (we got there early so we had excellent seats). It is so small anywhere would have been a great seat. Acoustics were very good, full bar in theater. One of the best venues I have been to in a long time. Use the valet parking service it was really convenient and affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankoJ4550MD
50,Rock concert with my 11 year old niece,"Went to a concert here. They had great security and the general admission/standing room only in the theatre had lots of options. My niece who is 11 was able to find a place to stand and still see the stage. Bar tender have her some extra maraschino cherries. Nice venue, nice staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunDancerSmith
50,Wedding venue,"Went to a wedding at the El Rey Theater last Saturday. It was a truly unique experience. It was like going to a show/concert. The nuptials was announced on the marquee. Seating assignments were given at the Will Call Booth. I think of El Rey and I think Art Deco, vintage glam and rock 'n roll. The groom is a musician. So the wedding ceremony was followed by a mini rock concert. There was ample room to dance at the bottom of the stage. If you're thinking of unique, hip, vintage glam, nothing beats El Rey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1183AYcarlac
50,Fun and convenient,"We recently stayed at the El Rey again. The first time I stayed at this motel was 30 years ago! It is close to everything. Nothing, yet everything has changed. It still has fabulous grounds and I love the rooms. It is under new management and some things are changing. I look forward to another 30 years in this wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W304UKjenniferd
50,Fantastic Venue!!,"We made our first visit to The El Rey on Feb 2nd, to see Tom Chaplin.What a great, intimate venue?!?The sound was absolutely fantastic, though I think Tom would have sounded amazing singing in the shower!!We had a great view of the stage all evening.The Security staff at front of house, were very polite, friendly and professional.The auditorium is like something we've not experienced here, in the U.K. A real treat.And the parking was also really easy and reasonably priced.We will certainly be back, when we next return to LA . . well done guys!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Westwick
10,Worst concert and venue I've ever experienced,"Tonight we went to see Haley Reinhart in concert at the El Rey Theater. While booking, there was no indication that this was going to be a standup concert. In fact the photos on their website showed chairs set up in the entire theatre. I couldn't believe we had to stand for the concert. Not my idea of a good time. The worst part was the amount of time we had to wait between acts. There were 2 opening acts and we had to wait about 30 minutes between each act standing up. How miserable and the sound isn't good in this theater either. Another tip for you readers is don't waste your money at this theater or a Haley Reinhart concert. Just wasn't good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzettestokes
50,"Rachel Platten, Eric Hutchinson, Hunter Hunted","Small theatre at 700 capacity. The musicians played superb sets and had the concert-goers on their feet bouncing for hours. Standing room only, the balcony has tables that you have to reserve for extra. Three stalls in women restroom, decent for an old building. Thumbs up for sound system, bass is strong. They didn't check handbags for gum for DSLR camera the night we were there (4/6/2016). Parking is scarce. We drove past the theatre to Burnside, took a right, pass 6th St. (traffic light) to Hauser. Find parking along Hauser.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTH888

30,Never any good bands and parking idiocy!,"We went to see Veruca Salt here and if I knew what was in for us, I might have reconsidered. First of all, the parking situation is completely stupid! No one in the area would honor El Rey parking, even though it said on the El Rey website that the big bldg. on the corner and other parking structures would. Everywhere I went, signs were posted stating that El Rey parking would not be honored! The only little lot that you could pay and park, allowed just 2 hours and would end at 7 or 8 p.m.! After that, you would need a city permit to park there! Of course, El Rey valet parking does not start until one hour before the venue opens! I ended up wasting $5 in order to kill time for the valet to open. They must do that in order to trap you into paying for the valet out of desperation! Trust me, it works! Jerks. When we finally were let in, I ran to get a spot in front of the stage and did. I have always liked the interior decor of the El Rey. An ocean of red suede with the theater logo projected on the stage curtain. Very plush. Unfortunately, no seats on the sides for those who want to sit and the balcony is WAY back in the rear. The acoustics were not bad and the stage is not too high to look over. Lighting was good too. On a personal note, there was a larger than normal LGBT crowd present. I have NO problem with this community, but we had MANY drunk lesbians around us in front of the stage and they were all over us literally! They would not leave us alone and kept touching us and prying into our conversations for an hour and a half! A LOT of sexual inuendo! It creeped out my date and generally was unpleasant! The show finally started and the three bands were great. I even got the most prized set list. We then exited and went to the valet. As expected, it took forever to get our car. Then the lesbians followed us out to the front where we were waiting and were drunkenly all over us again. They were waiting for their car too. Aside from that, the venue was okay, but I was not overenthusiastic about it. I have also noticed over the years that the El Rey Theater never has any good bands that I would want to go see. Therefore, that effects my overall rating of it. In a way that is good, because I NEVER want to go back and deal with their stupid parking issues ever again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelrH6268OA

50,"A great small, intimate venue","I loved this place. There is a small place just outside to get food and inside they had a bar with about 5-6 beers on tap with other drink items. For our event, the raised areas on either side of the floor had tables and were reserved for higher paying customers. Great place to see a show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetset1974

50,Great Venue....great sound and great views of the stage,"I always love seeing shows at the El Rey, many great bands play here and the sound is always really good. It's also a great place to see famous musicians in the audience or off to the side of the stage. I like many of the venues in LA but the El Rey is one of my most favorite. If there's a band I'm even remotely interested in and they are playing the El Rey I usually go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiraBabe93
50,Great Venue...BUT,"This is a really GREAT intimate venue, BUT be aware. Sometimes the times listed for the headliners are not accurate. When I bought my tickets it said 8:00. Then, when printed they said 9:00. The website said the doors open at 7:00. The headliner didn't come on stage until 10:15. There are about 500 seats. After that you are standing. Bars are very reasonable. Almost no bad seats in the house. Just go prepared, and with a full phone battery. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vc_93004

Much better than the larger stadium style venues for the full experience of music up close and personal!

50,El Rey - a rockin' good time,"When you see a show in a place like El Rey, you know you're going into a theater where amazing acts have been over and over - so you're getting a killer show, in a killer setting. The lights, the authentic deco vibe, and the neighborhood location make it even better than the history. It's always at the top of my list on LA visits. If you are the casual concert attendee or a music and venue junkie, this is a great place to check out a show! Any negatives people may say about it, well, forget that and enjoy the atmosphere - LA is lucky to have so many great venues compared to most cities - there will always be a rude bartender no matter where you go! =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720katyp
30,Great Lisa Marie Presley Concert!!,"Went to El Rey Theater to see Lisa Marie Presley. The parking is an issue. Hard to find parking in the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised when entering the venue. I like that it has a classic-vintage look & feel. The restrooms need ventilation. When I used it, it was very hot and stuffy and smelly inside. I didn't like the fact that there is a lady inside the restroom selling Chiclets and candy. It cheapens the venue in my opinion. Be advised, no cameras during concerts. No pictures or video recording allowed. Great prices on tickets and affordable merchandise for sale. I would go again for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sara0116
40,Easy place to see a show.,"Located in an old theatre in a nice neighborhood, this joint rocks! They have removed the seats, leveled the floor and made a two step rise around the entire floor, so sight lines are great as is the sound system. It was easy to get to the bar and restrooms, and there is plenty of parking in nearby garages. We've been four times while traveling through Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margob290

50,Great venue,"We went to the El Rey Theater to see Jack's Mannequin's final performance and we were thrilled. I've been to so many concerts and I have to say this was one of my favorite concert halls. First the location is pretty good, while we were waiting in line for doors to be opened it was really nice to have a drug store right next door that we could stop run in to get drinks and use the bathroom. Once inside the venue, I was so impressed with how beautiful it was. The lighting was stunning and for a small venue, I was really happy with how well cared for it obviously is. Sound quality was superb and there didn't seem to be a bad place to stand during the show. Because of the size of the venue, you could see no matter where you were. Furthermore, the sides of the venue are raised so you can see over the crowd and there is a balcony as well. Our concert was fantastic and this venue definitely made it that much better. Plus, the El Rey donated the venue because the concert was a benefit show fighting cancer, which shows they really do go above and beyond and care about more than just making money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sblake1989
10,Not worth it.,"We came here April 2012 with a group of friends to see ""The Dream"", rap/R&B singer. We purchased two VIP tables which also came with tickets for beverages.When we arrived to ""our tables"", which actually had both our name on it on a piece of paper, there were already individuals sitting in our tables! So we had to tell them those were our tables and chairs. Well, I forgot to bring my ID, I am 22 at the time, and they still served me alcohol, this was an 18+ event. So anybody could have been drinking. I was so upset that some people refused to move, so we went to security and had them removed, well finally they came and removed them from our area. Towards the end of the concert, when there was one song left, they decide to tell everyone to sit down, we couldn't look/stand at the balcony anymore, we had to sit. So now we couldn't see the artist because of this. So annoyed, it was the worst venue I had been to. Granted, it is nice, the bathrooms are very clean and well kept, but it was so disorganized, I will never return, not even if I am dying to see the given artist performing there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claudeezyy
50,Great Concert Venue!,"We went to see The Heavy play here and were not disappointed, either by venue or band. It was general admission, no chairs except along the wall on either side of the room. The balcony was for VIP and cost and extra $150. We were able to stand on a step that ran on either side of the room and see perfectly close to the stage. The sound was great too. I would definitely go back to see a concert here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelngav
