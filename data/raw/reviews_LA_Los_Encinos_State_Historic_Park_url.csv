40,"Not a lot there, but quiet and nice","It's a small park, but very pleasant to walk around, check out the duck pond (that also has swans and geese), or just hang out. It's quite a charming place, off the beaten path, and interesting to check out. It's not a place that you need to plan to go, but good if you're looking for something to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyblue
40,Little Known - Charming State Park,"Due to budget cuts, this California Park is only open from Wednesday through Sunday. It is a wonderful place to bring children or grandchildren to feed the ducks and geese. Children absolutely love this park and there are coin operated machines that sell duck food for 25 cents because they do no want you to bring bread to the park because the ducks and geese are unable to properly digest the refined grains that humans eat. There are history exhibits from the days prior to California becoming a State. Also, for the past few years, there has been evening performances of Shakespeare in the Park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/springpa
40,A lovely historic area,This is located in the heart of Encino. It is a well preserved record of local history. The guide working the day I visited was very knowledgeable and engaging. The buildings are in wonderful shape and the state deserves kudos for keeping this area open. A wedding was taking place the day i visited and just added more joy to my visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betty33958
