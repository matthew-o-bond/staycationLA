50,Horses for Courses,"My partner likes horses, and used to ride. I have never sat on a horse, let alone ridden. We were touring California, and Anita wanted to go horse treking.I found their website and called to see if there were any spaces, literally 48 hours away. There were, and the cost was $40 each for a one hour guided trek.We were late getting there, due to problems with motorhome, and were advised that if we waited, we might be able to move the time.We got the ride! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and we spent a good half hour chatting with one of the managers. We had the full hour trek, and came away very happy.we were able to walk around the stables, pet the other horses, and chat to staff.Very pleased and will recommend to others!",PhilGain
