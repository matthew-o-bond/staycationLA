40,Iconic Movie Location,"Many movies (even Star Trek, the ""Gorn"" episode) have been filmed here. There are a few interpretive trails and MANY cool rocks for the kids (and young of heart) to scramble upon. (The Pacific Crest Trail also cuts through this L.A. County Park.) The roads are rutted dirt with few rocks passable by your average sedan. There are large parking areas near the scenic rock areas.We arrived just before 4 pm when the visitor center closes. Glad we worked in a visit, but recommend an earlier visit in the morning (summer) to mid-day (winter) -- especially for photography of the iconic peak pictured. (It is heavily shadowed in the later afternoon and not as dramatic, IMHO.) I shall return for a lengthier visit.",Norm G
50,An Amateur Photographer's Dream,"We were visiting another location in the are and drove by on our way home and decided to stop. I have a new camera and am always on the lookout for new places to take pictures.This such a gorgeous place to take a nature walk. The rock formations are beautiful. Some of them were easy to climb, some of them were a bit harder. All of them were great to take pictures! It's a free park, clean and in great condition. The restrooms were clean and well maintained. We were there on a Saturday and it was busy, but not too crowded. If you are in the area and want a great place to hike and take photos, it's worth a visit.",Patty Leemhuis
50,Great place and legendary filming location,"I went motivated by the fact that 4 original Star Trek episodes filmed scenes here, most notably, the episode Arena. If you've watched the original Star Trek growing up and over the years you will immediately recognize this place. If this is your primary motivation to visit you can actually pinpoint exact rock features that are identifiable in the show. Amazing how so much of the detail of the rock right down to the small cracks can be matched with what is in the show 50 years later. This spot is sacred for diehard fans and it doesn't disappointment.As far as the park itself, it's absolutely beautiful and offers many trails that will provide a great hike. Even I was able to get a decent workout simply walking the area looking for filming scenes. Some of the trails are fairly high and not without some risk.The park at its entrance has a gift store and a small exhibit illustrating the features and history of the area. In the gift store you can buy items exclusive to the park and also related to Star Trek, if that's your thing. Most of the Star Trek items are oriented towards kids however.You could park in the provided lot as soon as you enter toward the right, however, I'd recommend bearing left and driving all the way toward the main hiking/rock area to avoid the walk along the dirt road which is about 5 to 7 minutes. Either way you'll be fine as there are trails that begin from the main entrance as well.",Robert Lion
50,Ck this out,"What a beautiful, natural place to explore. People go to hike, take pictures, have a picnic, relax on a rock, you make it what you want. Remember this is the desert so take some water.Parking is free. There are two locations for parking. One when you enter the park, and if you continue down the path there’s other parking closer to the beginning or the back of the park. You don’t need an all-wheel-drive vehicle unless it rained prior.If you want to make your journey to this remote area even more awesome there is a donkey farm a block away that you can feed them carrots or lettuce. So pre-plan and take some with you that was also fun.",June

50,Interpretive Center Adds to Charm of This Place... Yabba Dabba Doo!,"My wife & I had visited the Vasquez Rocks a few years ago. On this trip we went into the Interpretive center. (Maybe this facility was built since our previous visit?) It provides a really well designed ""story"" about the Vasquez Rocks area, telling about the original indigenous inhabitants, arrival of settlers to the area, and the fascinating collection of movie productions that have been filmed at the site.We really enjoyed posing our son and grandchiidren in front of the famous rocks.And, gee, once my wife & I got back home in the East, we just HAD to bring up The Flintstones movie on our streaming device to see where we had been!",EwanderingMan

It’s a good walk though and there are a lot of good rocks here - climbing the hill opposite probably gives you a great view of the main rocks.",mrdom
50,Its like walking into Space!,"Such a fun and beautiful landscape to explore. If you've ever seen the Star Trek episode you'll immediately feel like you walked into an undiscovered place of space. The rocks and formation are completely out of this world gorgeous. Make sure to check out the Visitor's Center that has informative videos and great background on how the formations were created, plus a really cute gift shops with lovely jewelry made from natural rocks and stones for only $5!",Astridrenee
40,Vasquez Rocks,"My daughter, husband and grandkids dont live far from Vasquez Rocks. The rocks are beautiful.

50,A must see! Great for hiking and photo opps!,"Really loved the setting and scenery here at this park. Its well maintained which is shocking considering there is no entrance or parking fee. There are plenty of trails to feel as if you were alone in your own private nature reserve. I'll have to go back and explore more and its truly a unique setting and one well worth visiting. Also love, love, love that they allow you to bring your dogs - thank you!",MooshLA
50,Captivating Landscape,"Excellent place for a post apocalyptic photo shoot. Also space themes as it also looks like you're on another planet! One more suggestion is prehistoric themes. Get there at least 3 hours before sundown because the sun goes behind some if the closest rocks around 2 hours before sunset. If you want to film a motion picture, you will need a permit. I called before we went and was informed that they don't mind if you you do still photography without a permit. The park closes at dusk and a few police cars show up to kindly let you know it's time to pack up. A police guard attends the gate at closing time as well and waves goodbye. You can drive right up to the rocks after a few minutes on the bumpy dirt paved road. There is a big spacious flat area to park and also trails if you wish to explore more. Admission is free.",VAMPLIFIED
50,"Its beautiful, even if you haven't seen it on TV.","Arrived in the early morning, shortly after the park opened. Was able to drive a minivan all the way to the main parking area at the foot of the rocks. Walked all over the site, and took lots of pictures. It is advised to stay on the trails as this is prime rattlesnake country and they were active when we visited. But we hiked and walked around, staying on the paths and had no issues at all. There are porta-potties on site if needed, and plenty of room for parking. It was amazing, and highly recommended.",fire_dad4
50,Not only trekkies should make the trek to these rocks,We made this a destination on a road trip round Southern California. Not all of our destinations were inspired by Star Trek - The Original Series but this one was. We just had to see the setting of Kirk’s fight with the Gorn. It really does look “outlandish” and we had lots of fun scrambling up those jutting peaks and exploring the other strange and beautiful rock formations in this area. We followed the big loop which made it something like a 10k hike. There is not a lot of shade on the way but we did this trip in winter so the temperature was perfect. By the time it got crowded we were already finished with our picnic lunch under a pretty pepper tree.,Ntalabany

50,Where the protype of Zorro originated,Wanted to do something close to Palmdale during the morning of Dr. MLK Jr. Day and decided to drive into the hills near Santa Clarita to Agua Dulce where these rocks sit. It was a great place for the kids to romp and climb though sometimes they went a bit too far up. The park invites you to explore all the ledges and rock faces formed by the geological activity in the area. There is a small information center where you can pick up some background pages and see a few exhibits which show the history and uses of these formations.Later we drove to nearby Acton which has a small but nice playground with picnic tables as well as equipment. The kids burned up quite a lot of energy outside and for free.,bfindysz
50,Looking For Gorn,"We went looking for Gorn, but instead we found a jack rabbit, a roadrunner, and some quail. Beautiful area. Fun to hike around on the rocks. We climbed all the way up the peaks, super cool. Can't believe people leave graffiti here - that's the only small disappointment.",noxiousburrito
40,Amazing terrian,We went early in the day so that we could avoid the heat. There were only a few people there when we arrived. By the time we were ready to leave more people were coming to visit these rock formations. There is a visitor's center with displays. We walked around and took pictures of the rock formations and enjoyed the area.

There are clean bathrooms , they do close at a certain time , but the lovely women that were working there actually let us use the bathroom after hours before they left . They saved us . There are Porta potty’s also. The beautiful rocks with all of their Angles and hideouts are so fun to explore and hang out. Bring a picnic and camera.

40,"Must See For Western Movie, Big Valley, and Barbara Stanwyck Fans","We visited the Vasquez Rocks because we are Western Movie and Television Fans, especially The Big Valley with Barbara Stanwyck. There are so many episodes that feature these iconic rocks, you could almost start your own Trivial Pursuit. Suffice to say that the rocks were everything we hoped that they would be, plus very clean and quiet on a Friday morning. We do not recommend visiting on a weekend, especially since there are people rock climbing and flying kites that will not share the space with people that have come for quick photo ops. Great for families with young children that want to re-enact the Star Trek Gorgon episode (we saw lots of smiling faces). The only reason we can not rate this five star if because of the staff at the interpretative center. They do not offer any assistance, but you may be able to pry it out of them. Best advice is to drive over to the rocks and do not park at the Interpretive Center parking lot, especially if you have disabled people or young children. Enjoy the view!",nancyandbrian2016

It really was a drive to get to it, out in the middle of nowhere but it was absolutely worth it. The scenery is incredible, and the hiking is fun.Note:Take sunscreen, and plenty of water. It's in the desert so it gets very hot and there isn't a convenience store nearby that sells anything.",Alana K

There are lot's of geologic trails and hikes, rock climbing opportunities on this place. It's a fun outdoor activity while enjoying nature. The Rocks as they call it are pretty insane. Giant monolith;s that jut's out of nowhere. You can scale the rocks in different directions at your own risk. The views are panoramic and picturesque. There is also ample parking. It's also near the Aqua Dulce Wineries. I very much enjoyed my visit. I came with my son and we had fun scaling the rocks and taking lots of pictures.

You will not get bored and want to keep coming back-Easy to locate and easy to find parking-Beautiful, different, unique rock formations all around --- basically a different scenery everywhere you walk around-Great for any type of hiker... you can choose your hike whether you want it easy, moderate, or difficult-Do-able for any size, shape, age, and family!-A lot of secluded areas where you can just chill w/o anyone in sight aroundCONS:-Touristy: we saw 3 major tour buses come through (however, never ran into them on the hike! ;-) )-POTENTIAL TO GET VERY LOST: be careful...the rocks start to look the same to you and it is hard to remember where you started from if you do not pay close attention! Keep track of where you are going!-Bring hat & water b/c there aren't much shade on this hike!-If you parked at the very first lot you have to walk on a road where are the cars drive by to get to the Vasquez Rocks lot and it can get a little annoying w/the dust in your faceOverall I HIGHLY recommend this hike for everyone as it is not difficult! It was free and so was parking so no excuses!! If I had an out of towner in town I would definitely take him/her to this place! It's that good!",jenrose88
40,Beautiful Formations with Hollywood History to Boot!,"These rocks are amazing, take a trip out and see all that they have to offer. Don't just stay in your car though, take one of the many hiking trails to see what you can explore.Also, do yourself a favor and search for Vasquez Rocks as a filming location to see all of the great TV shows and movies that have been filmed here prior to your visit. Enjoy!",Kaisertod

50,Beautiful Photo Spot,"I keep going back to Vasquez Rocks because on a clear blue sky day, you can get some of the most beautiful photographs. In addition it is always a fun place to hike, walk and climb rocks, though it can be very dangerous so exercise a lot of caution. There are lots of places to picnic. Dogs are welcomed on leash. The visitors center has a lot of interesting information on the history of the area and then many movies and TV shows that have been filmed here. If you want to drive back to the rocks, you will find the road a bit rocky and bumpy and all sand and dirt. You can make it any vehicle. There is no cost to few this area. Very, very nice.",Tennessee50plus

50,A Great Experience,"Vasques Rocks is a great experience to see how the movement of the earth can shape our landscape. A visit to Vasques Rocks is a nice opportunity for people of all ages to get an up close and personal view of our changing earth. In addition to the ability to amble about the slanted rock formations, Vasques Rocks provides an excellent backdrop for photos of all kinds. I have used Vasques Rocks as a backdrop for classic car photos as well as family photos. See one of my classic Mustangs at Vasques Rocks in the accompanying photo.",VetteGuy

50,Great place for a family hike.,"Visiting my brother in Santa Clarita and decided to go for a hike at Vasques Rocks. Beautiful location with varying elevation and grades to choose from.

The entire family loves to climb on the rocks and see how far and high we can go. It is hot in the summer and cold in winter so go prepared.",David T
50,Amazing hiking experience!,"My husband and I decided to visit Vasques Rocks on my late father's birthday in his memory as he was a huge Star Trek fan and they filmed alot of their ""away missions to other planets"" here. It is simply an amazing and beautiful display of nature and is something everyone should experience at least once.",irishsiren32
50,Free and fun nature that is close to home,"Having lived in Santa Clarita for years and years, i don't know why it took us so long to get out and visit the Rocks. I went here with my wife, who should have been a geologist, and 7-year old son. We had a great time walking the trails and climbing the rocks. The formations are just incredible looking. And for sci-fi nuts, you can recreate your own Kirk versus Gorn photos.Make sure to bring lots of water and also sunscreen and a hat as appropriate. It gets hot out on the trail. We didn't find Vasques' hidden gold but my son wants to go back and look for it again.",ready2gonow
40,Is this Earth?,"After living here for 8 years and only being 10 miles away I convinced my wife that we should go the Vasques Rocks. Bring water and maybe some snacks ( energy bars). We went in April as that it was not really that hot yet. I wore a sweatshirt after reading it may be a lot colder there than back home. When we got there we stopped at the first place for parking not knowing there were other ones further down, which I would say to go on to where the higher rocks are there if you wish to climb. There are different trails to go on at your own pace. Wife got a little nervous after seeing sign telling about poisonous and non poisonous snakes, avoid stepping over logs. These rocks are so different than what you see on a daily basis living in So Cal and was a great experience. Movie sets at times will be filming scenes here. Star Trek and Flinstones were shot here..",Charlie V
40,Enjoyable and worthwhile,I really enjoyed this place. A nice visitors center with plenty of historical information. The trails were well maintained and I enjoyed the different paths around the rocks and canyons. Plenty of options to get some elevation gain and get some terrific views.,Deanne A

It gets hot in summer so drink well and be fit to try to go to top.",IamVagabondDotCom
40,Our natural movie set,"Ok enough said about the many movies shot here, all true. You can't miss this place driving on Hwy 14. Well worth a stop for further exploration. Kids will have a ball climbing around these rocks and it is relatively safe for them. Do bring water anytime especially extra during warm season. Of course, great photo ops here. Lots of history here. Do visit the interpretive center.",Hal R
50,Great Hikes,Great hikes locally. Unusual rock formations created by San Andreas earthquake fault. Brand new Interpretive Center is very educational. Many movies and commercials have been filmed among these iconic rock formations (Flintstones and more),Kwazy2
50,Great place to see where movies and TV were shot!,"We went to Vasquez to visit the site where the many movies and TV shows we've enjoyed were filmed. It was thrilling to see the amazing rocks that jut high into the air. It felt like we were on TV. It even has a museum to visit. You gotta stop and see this place, but remember to bring water, it gets mighty hot in the summer. Good boots are recommended too.",Goodspeed11
40,Fun for a few hours of exploration,"If you like hiking, geology or visiting places where movies have been filmed then it's for you. Other than that there's not much to see here. It's dry and dusty. You can drive back to the main rocks on a dirt road in an every day car, no 4wd necessary unless the weather has been bad. Don't go in the summer, it gets HOT. Bring water. No where close to get food so bring your own, along with shade if you plan to stay awhile.",CaptainKimball
50,Visiting the Vasquez Rocks: DO IT!,I googled 'Things to do in Santa Clarita' and then read all of your reviews here. I LOVED it! It was about 30 minutes out of Valencia where I was staying. The trails are amazing just make sure you pick up a map from the interpretive centre before you head into parking. I got there right when it opened so it was quiet and still cool before the afternoon sun hit and we booked it out of there.I admittedly got a little lost so make sure you keep an eye on the trail. However it was easy to get out with the map. The vies are breathtaking and the staff were really helpful too.,ElaishaGreen
50,Really nice landscape,We visited this location because of Star Trek. We saw after that Michael Jackson filmed here as well for Black or White. Really impressive. Worth the drive up!,JFLeBlanc
50,A must visit when we have out of town visitors,"This park is famous for being the location many of the old western movies that were shot here. The hills and open areas with their distinctive geology are still used frequently for filming here in the SCV. Everything form the Flintstones to CSI have filmed here. Kids love to run up and around the hills. It's great when you have little ones that need to release a lot of energy, but also great for adults to enjoy the wild flowers that cover the hills in the spring. Really a worthwhile stop when in the area.",Mousecook
40,Neat place,"A great place to hike and see beautiful views. Can do rock climbing of sorts as well. Great place for picnics and photos as well.....was the hideaway for the notorious Vasquez in the past. Can be hot, so bring water and enjoy!",Cherie P

40,A hiker and equestrian jewel in the desert!,"Vasquez Rocks is the jewel in the Los Angeles county park system. The highly unusual rock formations there have been the backdrop for hundred of commercials and movies including the Flintstones movie where it served as Bedrock! Just about everyone will find something to do here. There is hiking, rock climbing and horseback trails throughout the park. Horseback riding is very popular in this park and sharing the trails is an important part of enjoying the park. There is plenty of parking in numerous locations so one can explore from different portions of the park. Thanks to all the movies and commercials filmed here this like many other LA County parks the admission is FREE! In my option the best time to visit the park is in the spring when the grass is green and the creek is running and the temperatures are a little cooler. The trails vary from walking across the flat portion near the parking lot to steeper trails dropping down into the canyons and then hiking back out. There is a wonderful big open cave in one of the rock structures that allows you to get out of the sun and enjoy the cool shade. Sadly there is no overnighting in the park and during the summer you must be out by sunset. They do lock the gates at sunset! The little town of Agua Dulce is only 1 miles away and you will find a small general store there to get snacks and cold drinks. There is also a nice Mexican restaurant named Maria Bonita there as well. If you love to hike and explore Vasquez Rocks is a hikers paradise. If you love to horseback ride you will find some fabulous well sculpted trails and some great areas you can ride off to explore.",Dwayne R

50,Great couple hours for lunch and a walk!,"I never knew it's was around Santa Clarita, but surprised when I got here. It's a few miles out of town and well worth going to for an hour or two. Even if you're not impressed with the whole Star Trek relationship, or it's use is loads of films, it's worth going to for a hike around the park. It's not a strenuous walk, unless you perhaps want to climb one of the peaks.if you do want to climb, I suggest decent footwear. I had hiking boots on, succeeded to the top, but tore the bottoms of my shoes up doing it. It's a good view from the top, but not if you are afraid of heights!Best part, no entry fee, and there is a visitors centre too! Brilliant!",Xenosapien

50,Great place for a hike,I have been going here for over 50 years. At 12 I was told that this was a hideout for outlaws and they hid their gold here. It was always fun to go search for it. As a father I took my kids here and watched them hang over the high cliffs. Great place to spend the day and bring a picnic.,Bob G
50,Definitely worth seeing,"Some really beautiful rock formations with a lot of movie and TV history thrown in. Star Trek, the Flinstones and many more movies and TV shows used the rocks as settings.",larrywatsonl

40,A fun place to get out and explore,"My 18 year old son had a great time scrambling rocks. Views were fantastic. There are several loop or out and back trails so you can tailor the hike from short to long. Oddly, there is no mileage info on the trail markers or maps. You need to track down someone in the visitors center to tell you the mileage. The trails can be combined to make about 6 miles or more. We did 2 miles out and then got caught in a torrential downpour. The trails turned to creeks and the nearby roads flooded. It was still fun!There is a small visitor center that displays some of the reptiles and geography of the area. There is also a raptor show and tell but not happening when we were there. Drinks, energy bars, and clean bathrooms at the visitors center.",Saint663
40,Stunning rock shapes,"Easy to follow trails, some of them with information boards on the flora, fauna and rock features. Large tilted rocks were a good backdrop to the trails",Alan D
50,So much to see,You could spend hours at this park exploring the rocks and desert! Stop by the visitor center and get your water bottles filled up! It is and dry out there !Its a very cool place to visit and spend time. Its out of the way but worth stopping and seeing.,jmaxson
50,A must see,"Vasquez Rocks offers walking, hiking and a quiet place to just relax away from the hassle of LA. Located a short distance from the 5 Freeway and Highway 14, it is a must see to anyone visiting Southern California. This past week-end we visited the Rocks but stopped first at the visitors center. A wonderful Volunteer (Tina?) took the time to show our Grand daughter the snakes and was very knowledgeable about the area. The time we spent at the center was a great outing. Instead of climbing the 45 degree rocks on this visit, we did the Geology Trail. The rocks are very interesting and the print out helped to know what to point out along the way. We go to the Rocks often and there is never a time I am disappointed.",Kathie L
40,Vasquez Rocks,This is a site used for many western movies and star trek. It is home to rattlesnakes so they recommend wearing jeans but we saw many wearing shorts and saw no snakes. We hiked in the morning and it was quite warm and breezy and hiked to a few high peaks. Bring water. Nice picnic tables through out. The rock and sand is slightly slippery. Good hiking shoes recommended if climbing the higher rocks. We hiked a couple of hours. The visitor center takes about 15 minutes and is worth an informative look into hollywood activities and the animals and plants of the area. A couple of hawks are on display in cages and leathered to the perches. One young one seemed in distressed.,Lv2T
50,Beautiful Landscape,"Growing up in the desert, I never really found dirt and rock so beautiful, but not the case here. Vasquez unusual rock formations make for simply amazing views, and brings mystery and intrigue to what would otherwise be a usual desert landscape.Great area for hiking, and if camping with a group, just an awesome spot!",Antrim8
50,A great place to hike,If you are looking for a place that was used in the Flintstones move or Just want to hike this Is a great place to climb and hike,Steven A
50,"An unusual geological formation, used in some sci-fi movies","VASQUEZ ROCKS is located in the mountains somewhat to the north of Los Angeles. The drive from L.A. is not long, and thus your trip will not require any planning. An adult could never get permanently lost in this park, because it is surrounded by towns. However, a child could be permanently lost, because of the many canyons, stone ledges, and high shrubs. VASQUEZ ROCKS is fine for short hikes, and also for longer aerobic hikes.TILTED SLABS. The main feature of this park is the strange tilted slabs of stone. Two of my photographs (attached) show the tilted slabs of stone. The largest of these strange stone formations is popular for climbing, and the tilt is somewhat gentle, and families with children will be able to climb up the tilted slab and climb to an elevation of about 50 feet or so. One of my photographs (attached) shows the view from the top of the giant rock.FIRE OF JULY 7, 2007. A well-marked trail swings through the southern half of this park. On this trail, there is a sign that states that this location was the site of a fire (please see photo of me posing by this sign).TAFONI AND CAVES. There are many opportunities to go ""off trail,"" and there is little reason why one cannot go poking about on one's own, in search of little caves or of natural features, such as tafoni. Please see my attached photo of the tafoni. Tafoni is a naturally-occurring stone formation, often found along California's foggy coasts, e.g., at Bean Hollow State Beach and Salt Point State Park, but also in various deserts in California and Nevada. At Vasquez Rocks, I found the tafoni in the canyon that resides at the base of a large, grassy hill. This large, grassy hill is located to the southeast of the largest of the tilted rocks in this park.DEVIL'S PUNCHBOWL. Devil's Punchbowl, located near Pearblossom, CA, has the same type of stone formations a found at Vasquez Rocks. Thus, for persons intrigued by huge slabs of tilted stone, I recommend visiting both parks.",Tom B
50,Great for Hiking and Group Camping,"Living in the area, I've been here many times and always enjoyed it. With our scout group, we recently stayed and camped at Vasquez. There is a nice campground which is out of the way of the main traffic, which is important during the day. The only catch is that they only allow groups to camp there. The other downside lately is the lack of fire permits given it has been so dry for so long. All in all, great place to camp despite lack of campfire. Fire rings are always a good alternative.",Antrim8
40,Star Trek rock shots,"Rocks yep they are rocks . But these rocks can be seen on Star Trek so we went and had a look . You can see why Star Trek filmed here pmus many other films. If you are driving from Vegas to LA its worth a pit stop, there are restrooms as well for all you Trekies",David F
50,Numerous movies filmed here...beautiful landscape,"Vasquez rock is northeast of LA up Highway 14. The landscape, caused by uplifting, is so unusual for southern California that it has been used in numerous movies over the decades from early westerns, to Star Trek and Windtalkers. The area is relatively small and can be enjoyed in 45 minutes or you can spend all day hiking up the outcroppings. The landscape is beautiful and surreal and what you might expect in Arizona. This was truly the best 45 minutes I spent in LA. The park is free, there is a small but nice museum at the entrance and several nice trail that can be easily walked by most people. It is a great place for taking photos and, for those a little more daring, a great place to climb up some rather steep rocks. It is about a 35 minute drive from the Hollywood area.",Tennessee50plus
40,Enjoyable Half-Day LA Escape,"I cannot remember exactly where or when I first heard about the Vasquez rocks but they had been on my Los Angeles bucket list for a little bit of time but never a top priority though I was always curious to check them out.The rocks are beautiful and a fun activity to get some fresh air away from the crowded city. From West Hollywood, it was only a 45 minute trip both ways without traffic which made it a quick getaway. It is possibly to simply walk around the area but you will definitely have more fun if you are prepared for a little bit of hiking and climbing. Some of the rocks are steep but almost everything is scalable if you are in decent shape and it was most fun to go off the paths a bit. Bonus for anyone who is a fan of the recent movie/book Wild, the park includes a portion of the Pacific Crest Trail which provides a good photo opportunity.The small visitor's center is updated with a few interesting facts but mainly serves as a restroom and gift shop.The rocks' biggest downside is the lack of anything else interesting in the area. While planning our visit, my friends and I tried to find anything else we could tie together with the park to make for an extended adventure but found nothing. The area does not even have a small town or food destination so we had to eat at a gross Chili's afterwards in a cookie cutter developed area nearby. These drawbacks aren't the fault of the rocks, but just things to be aware of when planning a visit. You're better off bringing some food or just eating when you get back home!",TheBoilerDude
40,Nice in the winter,"Nice, easy hiking in the winter. Good for children and families. Picnic tables and a portapottie as well as a nature center (which I confess I did not visit as I live locally). Very crowded on weekends and too hot in the summer but great on cooler days.",KCCowgirlLosAngeles
50,Awesome,I was driving on the 14 when I saw the sign for Vasquez Rocks. I wasn't looking for it but decided to stop. I thought I recognized the name from some old Star Trek thing or something. It's not far off the freeway. Excellent hikes around these rocks jutting out from the Earth at weird angles. Kids would love this. It all leads to the huge mountain you might recognize from tat Star Trek episode or Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. You can climb up top for some awesome views. It's a little steep and tricky at points climbing it. But it's really not difficult at all. A must stop place if you're in the area or want to get away from Los Angeles for some hiking and rock climbing fun.,Polaroids & Drinkin Stories
50,Kind of looks like Raditor Springs,"This was not my first visit to Vasquez Rocks, last time I visited was about 15 years ago. I don't remember it being so amazing, however we arrived just in time for the sunset view and although we did see other people visiting it was calm quiet and relaxing. My son enjoyed climbing and running around. It was a great day out and hope to come back soon.",Andre2411

The original Star Trek, Planet of the apes,The Flintsones, Blazing Saddles, 24, and many more. Stop by the visitor center 1st, on the right as you enter, before driving in to the parking area near the rocks. Bring a camera and some hiking boots.

40,Great hike!,"We read about this place by chance as it is not really advertised and we were glad to have come. If it wasn't so hot on this August day, we might have enjoyed it more! Vasquez Rocks is a wildlife sanctuary which displays one of the most interesting geological formations in California. This area has played site to many well-know TV productions and movies. During the time that we were there, a film crew was actually working. There is a self-guided tour with 12 stops that focuses on Vasquez Rocks natural and cultural heritage. Great photos to be taken. They do have a gift shop, but it was closed and locked up. There is an information center with some live lizards and snakes.",PepperNewJersey
50,Amazing place!,"This area has been shared by so many movies its difficult to keep track of them all but if you are a movie fan then coming her is a great experience. But first check the history of the place as it was once the hideout of a famous outlaw back in the old wild west!Amazing to think Captain Kirk once stood there, Bill and Ted had an adventure there and the list goes on!!! Free too when we went though I believe thats about to change with a visitor center being built!",Steve W
50,Movie history location,These rock formations have been the back drop for numerous movies throughout the years. Worth a visit to climb around.,McIrish1950
40,Fun hiking and scrambling around a well known film set,"Vasquez Rocks is perhaps most famous for numerous appearances in Star Trek over the years, but it has been used for many other things (lots of old Western movies) as well. If you're in the Santa Clarita valley then this site isn't too far and definitely worth a couple hours of your time if you like to hike. Driving up from LA was worth it for Trekkies. There are a couple of restaurants in Agua Dulce to quench your thirst after hiking. There isn't much shade and no facilities in the park, so bring some water and probably don't go in the middle of the day in the middle of the summer.",DeniseMW

Do not miss the Native American pictographs. Nice little interpretive center, though I didn't understand why their little gift shop was locked up.",Marianna B
50,Amazing landscape and even better for star trek fans,"The park is not the easiest to find as its rather understated but the characteristic landscape as seen in 1960s star trek films as well as more recently in big bang theory (star trek photo ep where they get car jacked). The topography is amazing anyway, and you can imagine dinosaurs walking the area.",psychicliv

50,Hiking for all levels,"Decided to start our road trip with a day at Vasquez Rocks. My boyfriend is a fan of the original Star Trek series and has always mentioned he'd like to go. Since road trips are about checking things out, we put a pin in this location on our map and started off.We got there just as the park opened. It was a warm day but not bad at all. I'm not a hard core hiker but there were enough trails to suit my ability and speed. Most folks just drive down to the middle parking lot, climb the iconic rock structure and then leave. We hiked around for nearly 3 hours and had our picnic lunch at a table by the interpretive center.Didn't see snakes although we were told to be wary of them on some of the trails that a little longer. The map of trails that you can get at the center isn't exactly the best; it's more general guidelines but the park is small enough that you aren't going to get lost in the wilderness. At a couple of points you can see the freeway.The interpretive center is pretty neat and they do have some animals on display, including said snakes and spiders etc. A couple of the rangers on staff also rescue birds of prey and there are several birds you can see up close; for various reasons they can no longer take of themselves in the wild and are cared for by the staff and volunteers.I understand that one of the actors who was in Star Trek lives in the area and occasionally does tours.

50,Great Place to visit,"a great attraction near Santa Clarita, California. This site has a history back to the famous bandit Vasquez but it appeals to me due to its rich history in western movies. Easy to access and spectacular to view. Lots of folks, including kids, climb this unusual rock. They still make movies and TV commercials here. Just saw one a few days ago. Nice small museum at the entrance that traces the area's history.",wff5
50,A Natural Landmark With Lots of TV and Film History,"Being a TV and Film aficionado, I grew up seeing this landmark in numerous TV shows and movies.This is a very popular destination for Star Trek fans, where Kirk fought the Gorn in the classic episode ""Arena""The view was beautiful, the weather was nice and sunny. I do recommend to dress accordingly with proper foot wear. There are lots of places to walk on here with trails heading in all directions.The park is free to access and there is plenty of parking right by the main rock.We took on one of the trails and took plenty of pictures. There was a group of people playing baseball in one of the open fields. That's how big the area is.All in all, we had a great time remembering movies that were shot there. If you've seen this place in a movie, I recommend to go for a visit. If you like the outdoors and walking trails, I recommend you visit.30 minutes north of Burbank. Nice relaxing drive to the area.",Juve_GLC
40,A nice escape from city traffic,"I'd heard of Vasquez Rocks years ago as the setting for many a movie and TV show. After some days in Los Angeles, I decided to drive up to the park one Tuesday afternoon, and I was pleased to find it a place of subdued and unusual beauty. There weren't many visitors on that weekday, though there were at least two artists working at their easels that afternoon. I could almost imagine I had the park to myself. It was a bit surprising to see how closely houses crowd the park boundaries.One can park at the interpretive center immediately to the right inside the entrance gate; better: turn left instead and drive southeast on a undulating dirt road about 2,000 feet and park very near the main formation (""Kirk's Rock"") itself. Note that it won't look familiar until you've passed by it and are in the middle of the parking area. There are porta-potties there on the far edge of the unpaved parking lot. Lots of walking paths through and around the rocks -- all are dusty and many are stony and require some attention. The rocks seem to be a type of sandstone; look along the dirt road for what appears to be a light-colored (granite?) boulder that protrudes right out from the sandstone.Getting there: coming from LA, I took the Agua Dulce Canyon road, which was a shorter route than going further to the Escondido Canyon Road exit off of CA-14. The ADC road had signs to the park along it.",kay-cee-1138
50,"If You Like Nature, Visit Vasquez!","I visitied Vasquez yesterday since I had a little time to myself. I am a photographer so I took advantage of the lighting that was provided by the overcast day. If you're a nature buff and want to get some walking or hiking in, this is the place for it.",SKUTRD1
50,Famous filming location.,"Some say ""the most commercially photographed rocks on earth"". They are photogenic, and fun to climb. There are websites that show you specific locations from your favorite films. There are restrooms and picnic tables. There are trails, including a geology trail. There is no charge!",Shadow010
40,See where Kirk defeated the Gorn…plus take a nice little hike.,"I had noticed those interesting rocks off to the northwest of route 14 while on a business trip to Palmdale a few years ago and wondered if there might be some hiking options there. Nothing came of it that trip due to lack of time, but a co-worker and I had some spare time this week on our drive back to LA. A brief review of the parks website and other information from the web indicated that this could be an interesting diversion. I mean, who wouldn’t want to visit the “planet” where Caption James Tiberius Kirk builds cannon from the natural resources to defeat the physically stronger Gorn. But I digress. Back to the park.As mentioned, the primary formations of Vasquez Rocks are visible from route14, which makes for an inviting scene when driving past. The entrance to the park is just a short drive from the highway and fairly well marked. The park itself is run by the County of Los Angeles and has several amenities in addition to the natural wonders. Due to our limited time, we bypassed the nature center and drove the well maintained dirt road to the trailhead. It seems that there is water available at the nature center, but there is none at the parking lot for the trails. There are porta-johns and a few picnic tables, along with a signboard with a general trail map of the area. The hiking trails are generally exposed, so plan accordingly (hat, sunscreen and water are all essentials). We had a pleasant day for our hike; sunny skies and temperature around 70 F. But this could be a brutal hike in the summer due to the lack of cover.We parked in the wide spot between two large formations along with about a half dozen other cars. There were a few folks milling about when we arrived, either packing up from their hikes or preparing to head out. There were a few folks working their way up the most prominent rock feature; perhaps for the view. But that did not seem like the best use of our time so we just started out along a trail that worked to the southeast side of the main formation. Pretty views, but the colors were somewhat muted (granted, we were hiking in the afternoon, so the light was not at peak, but still this was not nearly as brilliant as the colors in the sandstone of southern Utah).There are trails all over the desert around and over the rocks. We started on what appeared to be a nature trail, as there were signs identifying the flora of the area, and we eventually connected to the “hiking/horse trail” as we headed to higher ground seeking a vista point. It seems that folks just walk where ever they please in the park as there were many branches from the trail going in all directions. But there is very little chance of getting lost as the peak above the parking area is always in view…and route 14 is also usually visible from the trail. So we just walked where ever the spirit moved us.Not a lot of wildlife (probably the wrong time of day). I would have thought we might have seen some lizards or snakes out sunning themselves on the rock, but we did not notice any. There were a few birds in the area, mostly ravens or crows but I did spot a couple California Towhees near the parking area.The trail we were on for the most part did provide some nice views of the area. It was also a favorite for the equestrians, as we saw several piles of manure along the way and also passed a couple of horsewomen riding up from the staging area as we were nearing the end of our loop. Plenty of room along the trails, so no issues sharing.We were only on the trail for about an hour, maybe a little less, but that was enough to get a good overview of the geology of the area and enjoy the views from the trail. The loop we hiked ended back at the parking area adjacent to “Gorn Rock.” Vasquez Rocks is certainly not a “must do” but it was certainly worth making this little detour (and a lot better and sitting in LA traffic!). Next time I’m in the area, I hope to stop in again and explore the nature center and doing a little more hiking in the park.",OhioHick

50,climb to the tippy top!,"this was probably the scariest climb i've ever been on. i went all the way to the tip of the rock and i had to take a few breaks because i had literally reached my ""scared limit."" i needed a rest to let my fear lower a bit so that i could continue. it never decreased but i kept going anyway. it was hella windy that day which is probably why i was sooo scared to climb/crawl to the top. eventually i made it to the top and it felt amazing but the wind had me hugging the rock. there was a point where i thought the wind might've made the rock shake but i'm sure it was all in my imagination haha. anyways, this place is definitely worth the visit. there are less scary rocks to climb and explore.",F1shst1kz

50,Vaques is more fun up close,"You can see the Rocks from US 14 on your way to Lancaster/Palmdale. It is worth a trip to see them up close. Do check when the park will be open.

50,A unique rock formation,"We had passed the park on a previous trip , but were a little late in the day to enter . This time I was determined to visit . It was about 40 minutes from our motel in Pasadena and probably 15 degrees warmer . Luckily we had a lot of drinks with us .We only hiked about half way up . With the extreme heat we didn't want to push ourselves . We also thought being at the top you would get a nice view , but not be able to see the most beautiful aspect of the park which is the part you are standing on .I was very surprised there wasn't an entrance fee . We didn't stop at the visitors center . We just drove to the big parking lot near the rocks .The area wasn't very busy although it was a Saturday . I'm not sure of the elevation here , but we did see two separate incidents of climbers overexerting themselves by going too fast . One teenage girl looked as if she was about to have an asthma attack . People like me from non desert environments really have to respect what heat and elevation can do to our bodies . No matter what our ages are . My son and I were like the turtle to the teenager's hare , she whipped by us then had to stop and we made it as far as we wanted to go first .The park isn't a place I would return to . We had a great time and took marvelous pictures , but for us once was enough . I really did enjoy our time there though .",Skwiki
40,"Nice view, but smaller than expected","We went here expecting enormous rock formations, but only found these relatively small rocks.

50,Gorgeous CA State Park Along Pacific Crest Trail,"Though I have lived near the Vasquez Rocks State Preserve my entire life, I rarely visit because it was the home of many film, television, and photography productions when I was younger. I went last week on the recommendation of a friend traveling the Pacific Crest Trail from Oregon southward. He had strayed into Vasquez while staying with and saw not just the rocks, red dust, and vibrant green and gray brush I remembered, but wildflowers, chirping birds, small streams, and the most elaborate overhanging shadows and light. I was inspired to visit again and had my mind changed about the place. What a gorgeous and relatively untapped natural park in such a generally quiet area. Vasquez does not have the size nor the traffic of Yosemite, Death Valley, the Redwoods, or any other parks of renown in California. But that is a mistake. It has vistas, small hikes, wildflower collection, and even, newly built, a small Native American tribute museum that is tasteful and architecturally elaborate.",seanmalin
50,Really unique and easy drive from Santa Clarita,"This is a unique place, filmed in many movies. Fun for kids and adults. Some good hiking trails and neat rocks to climb on. I also heard there is a new visitor center but have not seen it. The only caution would be not to go mid-day when it is hot. Also - you can drive to the back on dirt road with regular cars...gets you closer to climbing rocks with kids or seniors who don't want to walk that far.",SCVerMF
40,Seems like it comes out of nowhere,"Great climbing rocks that once in the park go on for quite awhile. Amazing place to take a hike with family or friends and let the kids do a little climbing too. Interesting geography with how for this small area these magnificent rocks seemed to come out of nowhere. A lot of fun. Brand new visiting center has a great display on history, films made in the area and bathroom! There is also a small animal visiting center. Nervous that they will charge a fee in the future.",Calsey0078
50,The Only Park Named After a Notorious Bandit,"What an incredible place to visit! You won't find a more natural area rich in history, geology, movies, and some really cool looking rocks! You've probably all seen photos or TV commercials using Vasquez Rocks as a backdrop. Cars, drugs, bread, and much more have been touted with those beautiful Rocks. A great geology lesson showing layer upon layer of sandstone and debris and what happens on a fault line with pressure and resulting earthquakes. Take the Geology Trail for that lesson...short...less than 1/2 mile. Then move to the other side of the road for the Natural History Trail...about 1/2 mile to learn about the Native American Tataviams who live in the area and the plants they used for sustainability. In the 1870's Tiburcio Vazquez, a handsome outlaw, used the rock formations to hide from the law. The new (May 2013) recently opened interpretive center is small but has some artifacts, interactive history lessons, and a few reptiles native to the area. There is also an enclosure housing some native birds of prey. Drive all the way into the park...as far as you can go and take a hike up the main rocks, or venture off in search of the Indian Headdress rocks that were painted back in the 1930s. Warning....during the summer months temps can reach well over 100 degrees. Very little shade and bring plenty of water. Lots of great areas to explore...fall, winter, and spring are the most ideal times to visit. As you wander, see if you can find the spot where Captain Kirk of Star Trek fought the Gorn. You can also see where Bonanza and Gunsmoke were filmed as well as The Flintstones.",Mary J

40,Nice and free place to check out!,"We enjoyed the visit to the rocks. I wouldn't park at the entrance, I'd keep driving further down the path and park by the Vasquez Rocks. It's less walking this way in the sun! I'd highly recommend for all of you to wear sunscreen. I normally do not burn easily in the sun, but I did within a half hour there!It's beautiful there to take pictures of. After that, you can drive back to the entrance and park to check out the visitor center. It is very nicely decorated and designed in there. The building is LEED certified which isn't often to see. They once halted the constructing of the building due to birds making nests there and waited 6 months for the babies to fly away before continuing the work! Anyway, this center tells you about some films that took place there and etc. They even have a touch screen video that tells you a summarized story of how the Vasquez Rocks were formed. The video even has English subtitles, which is very nice, since I am deaf.Overall, this is a deaf friendly place to visit for families, friends, and photographers to simply visit for a hour or two!",BethNow
50,"Awesome geology, fun movie history","One of the high points of a trip to the L.A. area. It's between L.A. and Lancaster, so it may be a bit out of the way - but well worth the drive. Lots of movies and television shows have been filmed there. I was surprised there was no entrance fee to the park. We went on a week day and there were only 2-3 cars of people. There are large parking areas, so I imaging it can get crowded. It can be hot in the summer, so go in the morning. It's a great place to take kids - the landscape is so awesome, even they are impressed (for those kids who haven't been outdoors much - it's a great starter place). Will return there when I'm back in L.A.",JEBrandt
40,Great Photo Op,"Bring comfy shoes and water and camera. Stay on dirt areas and the rocks and avoid the brush ( lots of hiding critters) bites are rare but be sensible.

Bring extra clothes with you, although only 9 miles from me in the valley the weather is different here and can very deceiving.",Charlie V
50,"Wow, amazing landscape","I'm not sure which surprised me more about Vasquez Rocks: that it was such amazing landscape or that admission was free. I believe the upkeep is subsidized by the studios that use it as a filming location, but it's very well maintained and relatively trash free. Wear sturdy shoes as the climb can be steep - but it's just as pretty from the ground.Bring water as there are no facilities on the immediate grounds.",Carianne C

At first the park may seem smaller then you think but as you navigate through the rocks it can take a whole day to see and do everything including rock scrambling. There are cool Pictographs dated from 1500 to 2000 years old from the Tataviam Indians, you will also find their dwellings and grinding holes. A new Modern designed Visitor Center is almost complete. the hike is totally worth it especially considering all the films that have been shot here including Star Trek episodes plus the latest Star Trek movie but also Planet of the Apes, Little Miss Sunshine and so many more...if you've never done it...it is like a right of passage. Bring your own water, there isn't any water in the park.",Akiko A

40,A Trekkie's delight,"Anyone who is a fan of Star Trek (the original series) will know this is where Kirk defeated the Gorn. It is an iconic place, appearing in several Star Trek episodes. Walking around I was reminded of many other, older, TV shows and films that must have been filmed here. But as well as this the place is a delight. The rock formations are spectacular and there are paths to walk. Following GPS/satnav directions was confusing as we were taken to a housing area. Google Maps on my iPhone did a better job. There don't seem to be signs to it, so check out Google Maps and Street View in advance so the area becomes familiar. Come off State Route 14 up Aqua Dulce Canyon Road, right onto Escondido Canyon Road. You can drive right into the centre of the park. Do call in at the rangers lodge. They seemed surprised I did, and even more so when I thanked them for looking after the area. Most visitors don't seem to realise they exist.",Greavsie1940
50,Great view,"This is a beautiful place. A little hard to find, but that is maybe good, as to not be over crowded. The views are great, photo ops like crazy. If you like rocks. Also the hiking is good. Be interested to see the visitor center/museum place they were working on when we were there, when it opens.",ostokes
30,Disappointing,"As a big Star Trek fan, this was a must see site for my trip as it was used for shooting scenes in a number of episodes.I struggled to find it signposted on leaving LA and managed to find it 30 minutes before the park was closed.It was very atmosperic with the sun setting over the rocks, but I was surprised that you could drive virtually all round the rocks.It may have been because I was hungry and tired of driving, but the site disappointed me.",StevieB3052

50,Spectacular Outing with Unique Geological Features,"One of L.A.'s best free natural attractions, Vasquez Rocks is a county park masquerading as a national monument. This is such an interesting spot, and a good destination for a day trip when you feel like escaping everyday reality. Or, escaping our native planet in a sense.The BF and I been here numerous times, but we had a visitor from Germany last weekend so it was fun to see it through fresh eyes. We ran down some of VR's features: It was the shooting location for many films and TV shows, including Star Trek of course, due to its otherworldly rock formations; it is an ancient native American village site, containing (mostly hidden, partly looted) petroglyphs; it's full of fantastic hikes to caves, arroyos and overlooks, many of which are reachable by gentle traverses; the Pacific Crest Trail crosses through here via Escondido Canyon and a mysterious tunnel under the 14 highway; the area is home to beautiful wildflowers, juniper bushes and king snakes; you can view meteor showers, walk along a stream, day camp, picnic, take the kiddies on short nature trails or to visit a few captive birds on site with the ranger.If you look at the photos, you can see people clinging to some of the more dramatic vertical stone uplifts. It looks terribly dangerous, but many of these overlooks actually have a more gradual incline than you think, so you can easily walk at least partway up the rolling walls and bowls without any problems to speak of.Note there is no camping per se, no smoking or fires, but you can hang out for the day and bring a picnic lunch; there are tables, water and port-a-potties available and the ranger's trailer is nearby.It gets breezy and cold up there in certain seasons, and other times you feel like you're roasting alive in the arroyos; but all you really need is some water, sunscreen, extra layers and your camera.One other plus, the Pacific Crest Trail makes a beeline for downtown Agua Dulce, only about a quarter mile away, which has an excellent store for food and sundries as well as a couple of restaurants if you forgot to bring food.",SoCalRambler
50,Must see and quick stop in you're ever near here,We drove all the way up here from S/W Riverside to hike around these fabulous famous rocks. Used as a backdrop for a ton of movies and TV shows this unique pile of rocks is fun to play around on and makes for some great hiking and photos,vaj1111
50,Like No Other in LA County,This special place is like no other hiking spot in Los Angeles County. The rocks are spectacular. Bring plenty of water during the summer months.

50,Natures Visual Slant,"This park is an experience in the visual field as well as the ability to stand up straight on one of the rocks climbed. As you drive the 14 N ~ I've always expected to see a T-Rex peeking it's eye over the freeway, looking for food to devour. The adventure comes when you stop expecting to see nature and let nature express it's beauty to you. To view on a hike how the wild animals survive in this rugged terrain as well as vegetation that grows to feed those masses. Truly beautiful ~ Makes me wonder of the thoughts of the people whom traveled by coach or wagon train as they travailed this mountain range. I enjoy going during the spring when the weather is cooler. The newly green grass seedlings starting to grow enough, that it's a light green veil over the ground. Ready to feed those hungry lil rabbits & squirls of such. Seeing the creeks or waterways made after a rain. Curious enough to wonder about the gold and treasures hidden in those hills by various bandits or outlaws. Taking those hikes almost any which way I'd like to go. Finding new life all around me ~ Yes, I'll be back to appreciate the splendor of those jutting rocks as I let my imagination flow.Don't take it for granted all is calm. Be prepared! For the unexpected. You are in nature and you don't want to get caught unawares. It's not your everyday park to run around in ~ You've got snakes, spiders, scorpions as well as bees/wasps ect. to keep alert for. Especially as the days become warmer. Wonderful photo opportunity from dawn to dusk.",HopSkipandJump76
40,Boldly go where tons of nerds have gone before,"Vasquez Rocks is probably most recongnizable as the setting of Captain Kirk's now legendary fight with the Gorn from the Star Trek episode ""Arena"" - but it also has stood in for the planet Vulcan on a number of occasions in both TV shows and movies. In fact, that's what brought me to the park in the first place. (I just wish I bought a Gorn mask before I went)Located just outside Los Angeles in Agua Dulce, this park is amazing even if you don't care about its movie past.The angle that the rock pierces the ground and reaches to the sky is amazing. Photographs cannot capture the true scale of the outcroppings in the park. You have to see them to believe them.There's plenty of hiking and rock climbing to be had, and in certain parts of the park (where views of houses and roads are obstructed) you'll feel further way from human civilization than you've ever felt before.I've been here twice in the last 3 months, and I'll go back for more hiking as soon as the opportunity presents itself.",Matt B
50,Awesome scenery - right out of star trek!,"This was the highlight of a recent 11 day visit to southern california. The scenery was gorgeous and the rocks were so much fun to climb! It was all uphill but it was a fairly gentle incline so I never felt it was too strenuous. We went at the end of december so it was chilly but the sun was out. Still need to make sure to wear sunblock though even when it's cold - my face got a bit burnt even with 30 spf sunblock on! I loved seeing some of the locations used in a number of star trek episodes, galaxy quest (movie), and others. The scenery really did feel like it was from another planet! We were here for about 2 hours and felt like we got everything out of it we wanted to, so it's not a big hassle to stop here if you're in southern california and enjoy the scenery - it really is beautiful!",Mary626
50,Beautiful site,"Beautiful scenery! Try climbing the rocks, though it can get a bit dangerous. You'd have to have a lot of courage to try climbing to the tip of some of these rocks. I went in February, and it's windy and chilly, but the sun was still out. Not too many people. Very easy to find, no bathrooms though, just porto potties. No gift shops or anything like that; this is just complete nature and it's wonderful.",typome
