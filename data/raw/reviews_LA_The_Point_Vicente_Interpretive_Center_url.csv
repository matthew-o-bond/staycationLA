50,Wondeful Interpretive Center - plus outdoor trail walking with views!,"We'd been told to visit this hidden gem - not disappointed! There is plenty of free parking around the Interpretive Center, nice restrooms, and picnic areas in the shade. There is also a nice trail heading back NW along the cliffs that goes in a loop - quite an easy (not difficult) walk with spectacular ocean and coastline views. We visited on a clear sunny winter day and you could easily see Catalina Island! The grounds also have the lighthouse just a few hundred yards to the south.The Interpretive Center is quite interesting though and gives a really good history of the area. It even houses the old lighthouse lens that had been made in France in the 1800's and was used for a long time. Make sure to spend some time going through all the fascinating exhibits here. A true thumbs up!",pasowine
50,Such a contrast with the city,"It was great to experience this gorgeous peninsula, close to the city but in makeup such a contrast.After walking around the park, getting as close as possible to the grand lighthouse, we adjourned to the informative center.It gives an engaging account of the area, including the history of the light beacon. An added bonus was to see the large lens, formerly a key part of the lighting mechanism that for so many years helped to safeguarded boats and ships on the ocean.",permia
50,Very Interesting Ponte Vicent Interpertive Center; Also Good Views of Pacific Ocean,"We went to the free Point Vicente Interpretive Center. This is a very good smaller size musuem. There are exhbiis on the old Marineland. I had been there as a child so it was interesting to see.I also liked the historic exhibits on the Native Americans, animals, and on Portugeese Bend.There is a museum store.Outside the store, there is walking areas with good views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island.There is parking and it is also free.",mini
40,Little Gem; Great Location,"Our Family suggested that we visit. The Museum is at a great location - but a pity that the nearby lighthouse is not always open to the public at the same time.Well laid out with lots of different information covering the sea shore, geology, history of the area. Docent was very keen to lead us round describing everything as we went.Great attraction for school visits.",BobandJosie
50,Glad we stopped,"This little museum is a gem. We were staying at Terrenea and some friends recommended we stop in. It’s free to visit and a docent led us through and gave us a lot of background information. They show the history of Rancho Palos Verdes, the plants and animals that live in the area and especially those that live under the sea. You can follow the ocean walk from the center to the Point Vincente Lighthouse. Great photo ops along the way.",Jean U
40,Nice little museum,Some interesting artifacts from the past whaling times including an authentic whaling boat. The museum is free to enter and has the original lens from the nearby light tower very cool! We walked from the Terranea resort and enjoyed the views along the way.,tim s

50,Peaceful,"There is a visitors centre with toilets and parking. Even on a week day it was busy. People were picnicking on the grass in the shade at tables. There are excellent views from the cliffs. You can walk along cliff top paths, all very sedate and easily accessible.",Catherine M

40,ecologically fascinating and intriguing tectonic history!,"Having skipped Palos Verdes and Ranchos Palos Verdes on prior visits to L.A., this visit I took an entire morning to see the spectacular coastline and get a sense of these communities. The Point Vicente Interpretive Center is a great place to spend some time walking along this jagged and fascinating coast, and its exhibits offer insights into this unusual community and its geological history. Also very friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful hiking trails nearby as well. Definitely worth a visit!",steven m
50,Stunning ocean view for whale watching,"A must see for whale watchers between December and May! We took visiting friends to Pt Vicente during their April visit and saw three pairs of breaching cows/calves. The daily volunteers during whale migration season are engaging and informative. There is a chart posted daily, as well, of all the whale species spotted. The museum is so educational and informative too - it's free admission, don't miss it. But the views and the wildlife cannot be discounted. Expansive and stunning, not to mention extensive walking trails. Great place to walk dogs. Recommend going earlier in the day, although some mornings can be a bit foggy especially in May and June. Incredible spot for awesome photography. Saw a peregrine falcon hunting for its babies in its nest recently too. Free and ample parking.",OKgirl M
50,A scenic hike.,"The trails are just stunning. I recommend bringing a light cardigan, as it tends to be breezy. The whales travel here during December through March. The best part is that it’s free!!!",luisblas74

Not very large, but interesting for an hour.We then walked out along the cliff path to the lighthouse, unfortunately we weren't there on a day that it is open for tours, but never the less, it was nice to see and walk admiring the view.",susieb20
40,Rugged Pacific ocean shoreline views,The Interpretive Center is o.k. Look for fossils in the shale floors and walls. The ocean views are awesome. Great place for a family picnic.,davidkoch2017
50,Docent Tour & Gift Shop,"Take a walk along the cliffs, admire the lighthouse, snap some pictures, then take a docent tour to learn more about the area & it’s history.There’s a gift shop with unique finds, a drinking fountain, and a restroom inside.This is also a great venue for special occasions with an ocean view room reserved for events. It’s beautiful both day & night.I’ve brought school groups, youth groups, family for picnic lunches, walked with all ages along the trails, and come just to shoot pics.I do not recommend letting young children loose on the trails because the cliff’s edge is easily accessed, even though there is a metal tube fence with frequently posted warnings.",LivPurple
50,Beautiful place,"This is one of my favorite places in California. It is absolutely beautiful. Make sure to check out the sunset there. You definitely will not regret it.Not much of sand beach, but the cliffs are gorgeous.The lighthouse is great but I don’t think you can get in though.",oopshan
50,Fun and informative,"I walked up the Interpretive Center to learn more about the area and I was charmed. The docents were friendly and knowledgeable and for a small place, they had a lot on both natural history and human history. Also, an adorable gift shop. Highly recommend as a place to stop.",Jessica H
50,Worth seeing,"Small museum with helpful docents and exhibits including marine fossils, skeletons, and displays of land and sea creatures. Beautiful walks along the cliffs including views of the Point Vincente Lighthouse and for whale watching in season. Bring binoculars.",Sandy S
40,"After office hours, you must advise yourself","Every bench, stone plate seems to be donated, initially fascinating, later a bit tiring.By judging by the billboard outside it is a place where you have great opportunities to see mammals at sea, please take binoculars.Beautiful walk along a coastline with a high fall height down to the Pacific Ocean",Phayao13
40,Interesting artifacts and history,The center has some interesting displays on the history of the land (we had no idea Marine Land used to be at this location!) and on the ecosystems in the area. Good historical explanations. Helpful staff.,MBDinNJ
50,Beautiful Views - Worth Taking A Drive to See!,I had been doing business in Torrance and kept looking up at Palos Verdes. I finally had some time in the afternoon and took a ride up the hill to see what I was missing. I am glad I did! I stopped up at Point Vincente and very glad I did. Gorgeous views - also got to see some Grey Whales out in the Pacific!,FundDude
50,Great free spot along the PV coast for whale watching,"The Point Vicente Interpretive Center is a small, quiet facility located along the coast of the Pacific ocean situated between Redondo Beach and San Pedro quite near the resort of Terranea. It has a small wonderfully outfitted museum with artifacts from the area including history and sea life. It’s staffed by a great group of what I believe are volunteer docents who are quite knowledgeable. For those that remember Marineland, the Seaworld-like aquarium and amusement park situated on the land where The Terranea Resort now sits, The facility includes a room full of history from that facility.But, one of the best things about the Center is not the facility itself but the view and what can be seen from the cliff outside. It’s one of the best places in all of Southern California to see and track the migration of gray whales up and down the West Coast. On a recent visit with my family, we spent about an hour with the volunteer spotters on the patio outside the main visitor center watching as they identified whales — some 25 on the day we were there. Watching the majestic animals come up for air and if you’re lucky, breaching the water surface, is truly amazing. On a clear day you’ll have wonderful view of Catalina island.Admission is free, but do the right thing and drop a few dollars in the donation box on your way out. If you’re interested in watching the whales, I’d recommend bringing a pair of binoculars with you for the best viewing, though the center does have a few to loan out. In my opinion, this is one of the many hidden gems along this part of the coast. Enjoy!",Travel-Fan-10101
50,Great for whale watching,"Small but interesting museum, and a great spot to watch whales and dolphins. Even if you don't see any creatures, you can enjoy them vicariously through the museum and the chalk board that keeps track of the # and types of creatures seen that day and week.",johnpw
50,Good times,"Visited with a group of friends after a night out drinking at a wedding. Great, fun and free activity to do with family and friends!",Amilcar G
50,O.M.G. Fantastic!,"My cousin who has lived in the area for many years recommended this to me. Absolutely thrilling!! Saw many, many dolphins and lots of whales!! I was thrilled to learn that this was on my way to my hotel but it would definitely have been worth going out of my way for! NOT TO BE MISSED if whale watching is of interest to you!!",Cherylbc
30,Fun to watch the whale-counters,"The center's installations were old and dusty...in need of an update for sure! But, it was pretty cool to watch the folks who were there counting the whales and to see a few whales myself in the distance.",Judi-in-touch
40,"nice walk, beautiful views","We didn't spend much time in the museum as it is very small, but we walked along the cliffs on the walking path. The views are spectacular and depending on the time of year, you can see whales and dolphins. We were lucky enough to see both (it seems like your changes are higher in the spring)",mblume09
50,Unique location with breathtaking views,"I love this museum. We have been coming to this center for the last 8 Years on the regular basis with our daughter (she is 8 now) and it had never disappointed us. They offer kids activities for young children and even sleepovers at the museum with fun activities, pizza and a movie. The stuff is very carrying, professional and very involved. This experience would not be the same without them! It’s a great experience to learn the history of the Peninsula and explore some wild life that is around us also to watch the whales migrating, or just to walk on the garden paths outside of the center where tou can see a variety of native plants.",N N
40,Love the Scale of this museum,"The Interpretive Center is interesting and manageable. Think the opposite of the British Museum. Just a few thoughtful rooms with geological and ranch models, dioramas, amazing photos and short videos. The staff is welcoming but not overly intrusive. I learned a great deal about the various settlers of the peninsula as well as whales.",Helen F
50,Heavenly place,It is very relaxing and beautiful place where you can enjoy the amazing view and the most fresh air.,MaggieT4
50,A hidden gem in the Palos Verde Area,"Interesting and informative museum with a nice gift shop and a park outside. There was plenty of parking and places for kids to run and play. The light house is open for the public on Saturdays. Probably best if you call in advance to make sure the light house is opened. The museum is free and has historical exhibits, with geology and marine biology exhibits. When we were there they had exhibits about the old Marineland Park that was in Palos Verde. Nice and helpful Staff. Lots of great views for photographers interests in ocean and seashore snap shots. Stop by the Wayfarers Chapel if you have time.",HappyNorwegians
50,Excellent whale watching,"The interpretive center turns a day in the park next to a lighthouse over the ocean into real knowledge and wonder for kids and adults, and all that together makes for an unreal experience.",sterlingtallman
40,Great location to admire the coastline and the Pacific Ocean,"The interpretative Centre usefully explaqins thelocal features, flora and fauna. The views are impressive from its location on the cliff tops overlooking the ocean. It's only 5 minutes drive from the Terranea Hotel and the Wayfarers Chapel - a great combination for an afternoon out eith with the kids, the grandparents or both. Masses of free parking at the site.",Steve M
50,Interesting and Fun,"This is a great combination park/small museum. The view from the cliffs is breathtaking and it's a fun place for the kids to run, play, explore, and learn. I stop by whenever I'm in the area and have even seen whales crossing during their migration. This last visit I realized it's also an event venue! A must see!!!",airene2016

50,Nature Lovers must visit in Palo Verdes Peninsula,"Palos Verdes Peninsula is beautiful. You want to know how it is formed? You know about the fault line laying east of the peninsula? It is small but a lot of good information. Plus the view, the nearby lighthouse, it is definitely worth visiting. It is totally relaxing. Next visit will be to catch the sunset.",LaPalmaGuy
50,Lighthouse Walk,The lighthouse was only open on Saturday between 10-2pm but the 15 minute walk from the Terranea Resort was lovely and the interpretive center was interesting and enjoyable.,diana95426
50,"Beautiful Park, Bluff Walk and View","We really enjoyed our afternoon walk around the property and along the bluffs. Unfortunately the Interpretive Center was closed, but if we are in the area we definitely go back to check it out inside.

40,Very nice,"Well kept up and has a nice display to walk through with ocean eco items, fossils, and ancient American artifacts. Expect to spend an hour or so in all. Gift shop on site. Plenty of free parking. Of course don't forget the lighthouse for those that like to find them.",Jdk_mn
50,Pleasantly surprised,"I've passed this place numerous times and finally decided to take my grandson. Wonderful place with a lot of local history. It's a small museum, located on the coast with beautiful ocean views surrounding the property. Grandson enjoyed himself and look forward to visiting again.",Regina H
40,"3-for-1: museum, scenic view, local lighthouse","A bit off the beaten path, but then in metropolitan Los Angeles, how refreshing is that? Make it part of a looping drive around the peninsula, could even be a southern extension of a visit to, or drive through, Manhattan-, Hermosa-, Redondo- or Torrance beaches.",Steve G
50,Cool Little Museum,"The Point Vicente Interpretive Center is a cool little museum, if a bit unfocused. They have a lot of information about local geology, the grey whale migration, the history of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, and the defunct theme park ""Marineland."" The Marineland exhibit is particularly cool and unique, and I would love if it were more extensive. This is a great little free museum and anyone visiting the area should stop by!",ATL_Jacket
40,A place to see the seashore and migrating whales,"This is located on the Palos Verdes peninsula. It has a museum on site, along with some easy dirt trails along the coast. Clear views of the coast; when we were there a mirating whale passed by heading north.The museum has exhibits of the local history, including the Tongva/Gabrielino native tribes, the site's earlier use as a target range, long-closed Marineland, farms, and the local wildlife. A peaceful place to visit.",palmercottage
50,A great place to visit.,"Enjoy the extraordinary and breathtaking view, a pleasant walk, a well-done and interesting interpretive center, and a great garden of native plants. With good binoculars, and with the help of the experts, who are always present during migration season, one will probable see some whales. The birding is decent.",Kenneth U
50,Gorgeous place to watch whales!,Gorgeous views and almost definite chance of seeing whales or dolphins. very well informativeCenter on whales.,Travelingjuju
40,Excellent cliff views and easy walking path,"It's best when you arrive to turn right and drive all the way down to the second car park and walk around behind the Interpretive Center building. That gets you to the path along the cliffs overlooking the ocean with the best views. Keep walking in the same direction for 5-10 minutes and you will have spectacular views looking north up the coastal cliffs and across the Santa Monica bay towards Malibu. You can also see Catalina Island straight out, and the sunsets are terrific over the ocean. However, be aware of the postings that state the city's strict rules about leaving before dark, and we always leave within a half-hour after sunset. At some point, they do come to block the parking with a chain and will lock your car up in the parking lot overnight. There isn't any food options on the immediate premises, but you can bring your own picnic (no alcohol allowed in public).",PVPTraveler

You can borrow binoculars at the center ( I think it's free too!). Lots of great info. In the center but the real attraction is outsid, enjoying the ocean breeze and looking for whales. Ample parking and the grounds are well kept. Trails were clearly marked as well.",Mich D
50,"Whale watching, and amazing views!","Amazing location to view waves crashing on the cliffs. Enjoy the long hiking trails along the cliffs. Telescopes are available for whale watching. Very popular spot for whale watching. Great for being alone, couples or friends and family picnics in the shade or in the sun. Beautiful light house right next door. Point Vicente also offers a marine and local historical culture museum. I love to go here and just watch and listen to the waves crashing on the rocks below....",kpburgo
50,Feel Good Place to Visit,"The views from the grounds of this tiny museum are unbeatable. The tiny museum itself is very visual, interesting for young, old and all in between. Fantastic place to plan a small, romantic picnic (they would frown on anything much bigger). During whale migration season, trained hobbiests keep vigilant watch and count for passing whales, it's fun to strike up a conversation with these folks and learn what's happening close to our shores. The venue is also one of the most affordable and stunning locations to host a wedding or special event. As a local wedding photographer I have shot many weddings here and the location generates some of the most special and memorable celebrations I've attended the South Bay.",LaTourMimi
50,Refreshing!,"As a local hiker, I enjoy my trek through the trails near the Interpretive center. The whale watchers who station themselves there on a daily basis from dusk to dawn(Dec-May)are always so helpful to explain their mission, their sightings, and any questions I had about whales and the other various creatures they have spotted. I am one of those folks who enjoys feeding peanuts to the large pair of ravens who live in the area. Also most recently the falcon-spotters haunt the area with the giant lenses attached to their expensive cameras. They seem to enjoy capturing photos of the baby falcon recently hatched...It's so great to see families sharing a picnic on the various tables next to the ocean. The volunteers with the Center are always of great assistance. I've often done my Christmas shopping at the gift shop. Yes a pleasant informative place to spend an hour , or the day!",hjames328
50,Fantastic Staff,"I was pleasantly greeted by the friendly docents when I entered the museum. One of them offered to give me a free tour, which I accepted, and explained the exhibits in detail.

50,Breath taking views,"We are locals and go to ""The Point"" many times a week. Whale watching has become one of our favorite pass times. The little museum and gift shop inside is wonderful! It offers the history of the peninsula and is very interesting. The gift shop has a great little variety of collectibles to purchase- from books to art and jewelry. The Lighthouse is one part that we haven't got to visit as it is open one Saturday a month. (I always forget which one). Bring your binoculars and a light coat, some snacks and be prepared to spend a couple hours there. You can walk the trail that parallels the ocean, have a picnic on the benches throughout, or just stand or sit and take in the sounds of the ocean and fresh air.. free parking. Go inside and view he museum and if your able be sure to leave a donation. This is a great place to bring the kids for learning and just getting the wiggles out!",Tracy C

50,Great resource as you enjoy the coastal trail,"The size of this center belies its value. Knowledgeable docents answer questions about wildlife, history and geology. From the patio you can see whales and, on occasion, other wildlife. Binoculars are available to assist in spotting them. Signs on the patio guide the visitor as to which whales are currently passing through",Jerry H
50,Small centre but worth a short stop,"Not many displays, but the cost is also perfect.The interpretative centre is located at the nature reserve which is well worth a visit.There is an easy trail along the cliff top with expansive views out over the ocean where during the winter dolphins and whales can be seen. On land there are usually birds to be seen, but in winter the number of species is relatively low.Well worth a visit and we spent a couple of hours wandering the cliffs in the sunshine.",Anthony S
50,"Small, but informative Ocean Center","Our day trip to Rancho Palos Verdes was primarily to visit the Point Vincente Lighthouse, but that is closed on Sundays, so we stopped in here. It is very small, but the docents are chock full of information. Being that it's January, there is a good chance of seeing the whales as they migrate south. We were told that so far that day (about 11 a.m.), 18 whales had been spotted. We weren't fortunate enough to spot any. But there is an easy hike along the cliff edges that one can walk and observe lots of sea life and beautiful views. If it'd been a clear day, we probably could have seen Catalina!",Johnson0107

50,Low key family fun for free,"Great place to watch whales pass by, or, at least try to find them. There are always volunteers outside counting how many and which type of whales and dolphins were travelling by on any given day. The number can easily go over 30 during the winter months but we are lucky to see at least dolphins year round. The gift store let's you borrow goggles for free. A small museum makes you familiar with some tidbits of local history. Bring a picnic or go for a short walk to the lighthouse. The trails also lead about .5 mile north with breath-taking views.",S. M
50,Whale watching spot,"We took a walk along the easily navigable ocean view trail that led to the interpretive center. Friendly folk were watching for returning gray whales and other sea life with binoculars checked out from the front desk. A nearby board posted the recent sightings. Nice morning out, helpful docents, easy & free parking.",RoastDuck
50,Great Small Museum with Walk Down Marineland Memory Lane,"This is a lovely park with free parking overlooking the ocean in RPV. Many come for weddings, to whale watch or to check out the lighthouse. Bringing a picnic and enjoying the view is a great way to spend a couple of hours. We went to the museum and caught the short video offered on the history of Marineland. Since I grew up in Los Angeles and went to Marineland as a child, it was fascinating to see the creation.. and ultimate destruction of a family favorite marine park. The video is informative and provides a great historical perspective. The museum is free but they warmly welcome any donations. Having visited the lovely Terranea resort, I can see why people love that resort and its addition to RPV. However, I will always miss Marineland (formerly located at what is now the Terranea resort) and childhood memories in the park. I suggest you go to Nelson's at the Terranea for lunch, and then venture to the Point Vicente Interpretive Center to round out your afternoon. The two are very close in proximity by car.",mdbgoldfamily
40,Darling Museum Good For All family,"I have lived in LA for decades and have been to Palos Verdes many times but had never visited the Point Vicente until a year or so ago. And what a treat!Whales were passing by the point and people were counting them. Then in the center we learned not just about the whales but also the Chumash (local tribe) and the geology and geography of Palos Verdes. One of the things I never forgot and still tell friends is that Palos Verdes is the last ""Channel Island"". It is just like Catalina, St. Nicholas, Anacapa and the rest...the only difference is that the ocean is no longer surrounding it. But it was formed like the other islands. And when you are north of PV looking down from some place like the Hollywood hills you can see how it does appear to look like an island. Great center for all ages.",TracyHawaii
40,Great views,Has great views of the ocean. unfortunately all parks with walking trails or pull offs in Palos Verdes have spectacular views and this one gets lost with all the competition.,Joyce and Dean
50,Take a picnic with you!!,"One of my favorite spots to relax and enjoy the view. The Interpretive Center is a wonderful way to know the history of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, but the grounds, including the lighthouse (which is only open on certain days so find out before going), can make the experience an entire afternoon. Take a blanket or use one of the picnic tables available. There's room for games like corn toss, Frisbee, etc... I even recommend taking a folding chair and your favorite book for quiet time. The cliff-level view of the ocean makes for a great sunset. Parking is easy, but you have to watch for the signs so you don't pass by the entrance.",Julie A
50,Exquisite coastal views,This is one of the best locations for rugged coast line with fabulous views as you stroll along the paths overlooking the Pacific. On clear days you can see for miles and at the right time of year see the whales migrating. The Interpretive Center a wealth of knowledge and great spot to educate your children in creative ways. John Olguin and others explain the marine life through a short film. Well worth the trip.,aafa
50,Beautiful site and well worth the trip from the many places we visit in LA,"The view were spectacular and the breeze of wind blowing at you is mind peaceful feeling. We spent a week visiting LA and driving all over. This one is on top of the list, free to to come and soak it the view.",Niroth T

40,Beautiful View,I was there this past weekend for my friend's wedding. The view is absolutely amazing. The only negative thing I have to say is that the wedding reception had to be over by 10:00PM so it didn't give enough time.,misscancer77

50,Best view & best introduction to area,"First off, did you know that this is where the official counters for the grey whale migration dot and record? That's fascinating enough but the interpretative center also gives you. Background on one of the first marine life parks in the US, Marineland. Great for families - no too large but informative. The trails in the area are lovely and take you around the coastline and through some natural habitat. Also a great place to picnic and just spending some time relaxing. Sunsets are magical - best vie anywhere!!",cathy041

50,Worth going to again and again,So relaxing. Always interesting. Most of the time I use the adjacent trail along the cliffs for a good walk.,Joan R
30,Not Worth Going Out of Your Way,"I didn't think the ""interpretive center"" was special as compared to the normal path along the coast. I felt it was kind of a waste of time and nature lovers would be better served hiking the complete path and reading the signs along to the path to find out the history of the area.",Greg S
50,Very well done and a wonderful movie indoors.

50,Great day trip destination,"The Pt. Vicente Interpretive Center - that title seems kind of boring, but this is a family destination that is anything but boring. It is a little ""museum"" with a focus on the whales that migrate past this point of Rancho Palos Verdes. On the patio (with a full-size etched whale in the concrete) sit the members of the Cetacean Society with their binoculars during the main migrating season - Dec. - March and sometimes beyond- doing their whale and dolphin count which you can read on their chart. It is always exciting to see those whales spouting! The Center is located in Lower Pt. Vicente Park, a natural open space area with trails and picnic tables, even some shade trees, and plenty of parking. The museum is FREE! At the desk inside, pick up some informative sheets. I particularly like the one that pictures the relative sizes of the various whales and dolphins. Dogs are allowed on the grounds on leash and the trails from this point continue north so you can take a pleasant walk on the bluff; the trail is flat and wide enough for a baby stroller or wheelchair, too. The Pt. Vicente lighthouse is on the Coast Guard property next to the Interpretive Center, and it makes a very scenic backdrop for special family photos while you are there. There are bathrooms both inside and outside the museum and a small gift shop. A few vending machines are on the patio, but no real food is available, so bring your own. There is a shopping area (Golden Cove) about 1 1/2 miles north that includes a Starbucks and Trader Joe's. The area is very bicycle friendly, with bike lanes along Palos Verdes Drive. Every March the City hosts a ""Whale of a Day"" event (free) at the Center, with vendors, performers, displays, and food, with shuttle buses (free) from a nearby parking lot - Google it for the current date. I live very close and bring the grandkids there; they love to slide down the cement sidewalls of the amphitheater! See you there!",LORRAINE O
50,Stunningly beautiful,"I have seen some beautiful coastlines, but Rancho Palos Verdes was just gorgeous. It's great to walk along the trails and just take in the sounds and sights of the ocean. I would definitely choose this over a crowded day at Huntington or Laguna.",PH2003

50,Wonderful Views and Nice Strolls,"This is a wonderful brief trip, especially with children, to walk the nicely groomed trails and visit the Interpretive Center which features exhibits and lectures on the Palos Verdes Coastline and its whale watching and local flora. The views are spectacular, and in the spring and fall, many whales can be seen migrating (bring binoculars). It can get a little ""breezy"" near sunset, but the views are spectacular especially if there are some clouds to reflect the sunset colors. You can bring a picnic snack as they have several tables there.",Kent S
50,Favorite Place to go!,"This is my ""Go To"" spot at this time of year.

Have a picnic, bring the family, take a long walk along the cliffs, shop in the museum shop, take a tour of the museum, enjoy the sunshine and fresh air.........it doesn't get any better.

There is no beach access, though people still will brave the steep cliff face to get down somehow - NOT safe. This is a great place to picnic and take a relaxing stroll. You can pick up some food at the nearby shopping center and sit at one of the several picnic tables here. Parking is free. The paved lot can get full, but there is a sizable overflow dirt lot at the southern end of the parking area.",0garibaldi0

On the site of the old Marineland and taken care by the Palos Verdes land conservancy. There is a flat hiking trail along the cliffs over the beach that goes about 2 miles. Ther is a small museum with exhibits of Marineland and life on the Peninsula when the Indians were here. Both the parking and the museum are free. Outside along the cliff path there are picnic tables with a beautiful view of the ocean and coastline. Dogs on leashes are welcome. You may spot some people recording the marine life as it passes by. When I was there recently the log book mentioned the dolphins and a whale that had been spotted. This is not a large museum the self guided tour will take about 10 minutes. The area is beautiful and relaxing the hiking path is dirt so wear shoes you do not care to have dirty. come to relax, let the dog play and settle in for a picnic and a gorgeous view of the ocean. You will be above the water over the cliffs there is no beach access so you will not be in the water.",Diane H

My understanding is Whales can be seen January through April. We saw several Whales blowing water, binoculars helpful for closer viewing. Very interesting how they track the sightings. Great place for a picnic. small informational center, shop and restrooms.Down the road at the Trump International golf course are public free hiking trails down to the ocean beach and tide pools (low tide only). My understanding, local knowledge, public can park at the golf course for free, no problems for us. Walk off the cement walkway west side of parking lot, down behind club house, west of the beautiful american flag, you will find a beautiful open space and the trails at the far west side. Be respectful of golfers, pay big money to play.Hike down, one path is steep, another path a little longer with less slope. Seniors could walk less slope, would not recommend steep one. Dogs aren't allowed on beach, few people ignored the dog law but kept dogs on leashes.Recommend one down path down and one up. Reverse hike, meaning steep downhill walk, walk back uphill. We were there only for the Tide Pools, loved hike, did not walk beach. Kids loved stepping and jumping the rocks, 9-12 year olds, we did in flip flops and croc's, temperature cool by water in April, wore sweatshirts for a while. Even found a golf ball that went astray, saw small crabs, sea Urchins but no starfish this trip.You can google this location, Palos Verdes and Trump International Rancho Palos Verdes for more details.

You can take a walk on the trail and even bring our dog. It's a great way to spend a little time. We're from the area and go often, especially during February and March when the whales are migrating. You can also see dolphins. I highly recommend this bit of local Palos Verdes. It's good for families, couples or just going yourself. Good accessible parking, and - it's free. You can always make a donation, which is always greatly appreciated.",Dana G
50,Great views & see whales from the bluff,Stopped here on a drive along the coast to see the lighthouse and museum. Great place to just chill and watch the Gray Whales swim north (this time of year). There were volunteers counting the whales going north. Very interesting. The little museum is nice and provides some history of the area.You don't feel like you are in the mega city of LA as you drive and stop at the shoreline parks from LA Harbor up to Hermosa Beach. Do the drive - you'll be glad you did!,ItchyFeet
40,Views! Whales! Beautiful!,"Ahh....I must admit, we only stepped inside the (clean, welcoming) Interpretive Center to visit their (clean, open) washrooms, but we spent the better part of an hour on the grounds along with a number of people who were watching for whales ... and we had a whale sighting! Fun. Really gorgeous views, with bench seating that allows you to soak in the views! Free parking.",clamc40
40,Great hike and break from the city. Wonderful views and Memories of Marineland,"Stopped by on our drive along the Palo Verde peninsula. This was a beautiful spot with some great trails along the bluff. They have a little amphitheater to sit and watch for whales or dolphins.. The interpretive center was very interesting about the history of the area from the Indians to Marineland, I remember going there when I was younger. They had a great movie that brought back so many memories.. Great photo spot or for a fantastic picnic lunch!!!!",Michael S
50,"See a Whale, or remember Marineland.","This was a great way to finish our trip. We whale watched out on the deck out back, and did a fantastic tour inside with a lot of the old Marineland memorabilia.",JHuante
50,"Great view, very interesting!",Enjoyed touring the center to get a better perspective of the history of the area! The volunteers there are very knowledgeable and clearly enjoy being ambassadorts to their locale. Spoke to the whale counter who were set up on the patio and saw whales spouting!,Nancy D
50,So beautiful!!,"This place is so amazing! The beach is so beautiful~ You can just walk along the path and enjoy the wind and the sun. Extremely photogenic place. Also, I think you can spot dolphins. Easy to find and easy to park :)",Pureum K
50,Wow Whales,"The Point Vicente Interpretive Center is located in beautiful park along the coast. With beautiful views, great walking trails, very nice picnic areas and is both kid and dog friendly. The Center has a very nice presentation on Whales and the local ecology. But for our visit the BIG attraction were the Whales that were swimming by. The point offers just great view of the ocean, when we visited we were luck enough to see 5 whales. One gray whale was close enough that it was easy to see without binoculars. While other were a little way out for which we did need to use binoculars, but just regular one that we often use on hikes or checking out birds in out back yard. Point Vicente is a nice family friendly place to go, especially in Whale season which is from December to early March.",GAM
50,Great walk and views,"I am a frequent visitor to the area and aways take walks at Point Vincente. There is a great walk along the bluffs overlooking the ocean. On a clear day, you can see Catalina Island, and will frequently see dolphins, and whales at certain times of the year. There is staff available during the whale migrations to help you spot as they migrate either south or north. This is a hidden gem, the views of the coves and waves breaking on the rocks, are wonderful. Bring your binoculars.",John N
50,Lovely respite from the city,"The Interpretive Center is a great place to walk your dog, whale watch, go running, have a picnic, have a small wedding, or just enjoy the beauty of the Pacific coastline. However, be aware if you wish to use this site as a wedding locale, the room is meant for a maximum of @ 110 people.",Bgoodtoall
40,A local attraction from a local,"The PV Interpretive Center is a local gem almost taken for granted by the locals. I am not sure if it is worthy as a destination location but certainly if you are in the area it is worth a visit. During the migration season there are usually volunteers who will help you spot the Pacific whales as they proceed through the Catalina slot. The center also has displays of local flora and fauna. The Golden Cove Center across the highway is also available for restaurants, Starbucks and a a Trader Joes where you can collect a picnic lunch to eat at the Center.",Surfpv
40,Annual Election Day Visit,"The Interpretive Center is on my running path to my voting place so I go by when it is open which is 10am to 5pm. The grounds are open dawn to dusk; as are the parking areas in the residential areas just north.There are picnic areas but the only food is from vending machines; there are food stores close by at 31186 Hawthorne Blvd Rancho Palos Verdes, where there is a 7-11, Starbucks, Subway and Trader Joe's plus Restaurants in the same shopping center which we used to refer to as Golden Cove. Or Terranea if you wish.They change the exhibits every so often: the main Marineland exhibit is gone but they still have parts of it up. Similar to Marineland, for those that remember, this is not large but they make good use of the space they have. It will not take you more than a half, only longer if you really want to linger and/or enjoy the area.You can have an event ranging from weddings to reunions, and you get a discount for being a Rancho Palos Verdes resident. Here is a link to the costs, rules and restrictions: http://palosverdes.com/rpv/recreationparks/PVIC-Brochure.pdf Highlights are you have to clean up afterwards (including mopping the floors!), no music after 10pm, and confetti, rice, birdseed, rose petals are prohibited as well as the release of balloons. I am in full agreement with that last one!",jimtreeves
50,Great history and whale watching from shore,"Make sure you go during whale migration time. Just call and they will tell you the best months. If you are not in the area during that time still stop by and learn about the areas history. In my 7-8 trips to PV I have spotted numerous whales (no telescope, just cheap binoculars). I have never gone just to view whales but normally to show house guest the museum and view on the way to Wayfarers Chapel. Hit them both up in the same day trip, they are only about 1 mile apart, if that. The museum was free last time I went but they have a box for donations. Great place to have an event as well!",DachK
50,PV history comes alive,"Arrived at the Center via the Seascape Trail. It was a nice rest stop on our way to Terranea Cove. Here you'll find helpful docents and an excellent place to take in the views. Interesting exhibits showcased the Tongva Indians, the early rancheros, the once bustling farming community, and of course, the vibrant marine life.Marineland of the Pacific was once everyone's favorite place to visit on the peninsula. There are plenty of photos, memorabilia of the famous landmark and brought back fun memories of Orky and Corky, Bubbles, and the rotating Sky Tower....gone, but not forgotten here!",Shimadog
50,"Whales, Dolphins Fun, Fun, Fun!",If you love whale watching . This is a wonderful place to take kids and adults. The Docents are so wonderful.,Anna U
40,GREAT for Palos Verdes history and ocean views/whale watching,"This sight is truly a JEWEL of our area.It is well placed for incredible views of the Ocean (Pacific, of course), Catalina Island, whales & dolphins during parts of the year. The facility houses many artifacts of the Palos Verdes peninsula and more, including a very nice, comprehensive movie of the history of the area too.",PVJOE
50,A Relaxing Afternoon,"This is a wonderful location - it has it all: view of the ocean, a great trail that parallels the coast line, and a wonderful interpretive center that features nice indoor displays of local history and biological marine life. Children will love it here as well as adults. It also has a nice gift shop - great for picking up a souvenir or a little gift to send to a relative who lives away from an ocean. Plenty of free parking.",Montagirl
40,Worth the visit,This stop was worth the visit. Stop and chat with the friendly diehard whale watchers. Have a picnic. Tak photos and just Relax,CycoPath
50,"Whales, pelicans & dolphins oh my!","This lovely little jewel offers education on the inside, stunning views on the outside and animal sightings of all kinds. Hike the trails in either direction along the bluffs, bring your dog, bring a picnic, bring your binoculars (seriously!). Watch where you step - I've even seen rattlesnakes. I especially love visiting the back patio and chatting with the volunteers counting the whales - they'll let you know when & where if any are in the area & receive communications from boats and pilots up & down the coast so they are hooked up with information. The museum itself is a great place to start for a general history of the area and what type of marine & animal life you can expect on the outside. It's fascinating to think of the native Indians who enjoyed this lovely spot long before today. They have well informed and enthusiastic docents & it is free. The gift shop has many unique & relevant items. Note that this is the tip of a peninsula, thus the lighthouse next door - this geographic feature makes it a unique and very beautiful location. The cliffs are about 200' above the tide pools and the breaking waves can be dramatic on a high surf day. Warning - don't get locked in, pay attention to the parking lot closing times which vary by season. Not open major holidays. Don't forget the hat & sunscreen - you could play here all day!!",QBwashere
50,Information re the surroundings and fossils,"Informative and well presented, excellent examples of fossils,Whale watching and information. A History of the area, examples of fossils found, information concerning all forms of relevant sea life, rocks, cliffs, excavation, history. A discussion of the progress of the area and the people and development to the present.",Joan F
50,Beautiful spot,The museum (old Marineland artifacts and sea life information) and gift shop are interesting and the grounds are beautiful. Parking is free and it is dog friendly - bring a picnic. Do not miss the whale watching - the fence posts are numbered and the volunteers will announce what fence post to look towards - so that everyone has a good chance of seeing these magnificent creatures. Gray whales migrate from December to early May.,Anne32825
40,You'll love the Marineland memories,"The views from the property are stunning. The staff is very willing to share their knowledge with you. We visited Marineland growing up and loved the room devoted to the former park, from photos to a dolphin stroller.",Sheri V
50,Bit of History!,I called into see the Center which is located next to the Lighthouse. No charge to enter but a donation is appreciated. I was here 15 years ago and got a great lesson on the geography of the Los Angeles basin and Palos Verdes. This time around I was not dissapointed and really enjoyed seeing old memorabilia of Marineland which was located next door until that closed in the 80's. Beautiful views and calmness outside. This is a real nice place to go and see.,James6259
50,Talk to the whale census takers!,They are dedicated and conversational. Sign their guest book and bring your binoculars during the annual migration. Palos Verde is gorgeous and one can imagine the locals like to keep it their own secret.At the Interp. Center there's plenty to do. Find our about the history inside the museum. Be sure and take advantage of the very cool gift shop. Hike down to the tidal pools then just a drive up the road to the Wayfarers Chapel.We really enjoyed this gem.,HereThere44
50,Ocean lover's paradise,"I only recently discovered the Pt. Vicente Interpretive Center, yet I've lived nearby most of my life. Parking is easy and wasn't too crowded when I went (mid-day on a Friday). The location and views are excellent for whale-watching, and there are picnic facilities for lunch with a view. Inside of the interpretive center there are educational displays about the history of whaling, biology of whales and kelp forests. Best of all (for me!), is that there is an area dedicated to Marineland of the Pacific which used to be nearby. Seeing the ""artifacts"" from Marineland really took me back and reminded me just how much of my appreciation for the ocean and marine life came from visits to Marineland in my youth. There is also a mini-movie theater type of area that shows a looping video about whales and migration up/down the Pacific coast, and if you ask the staff, they will pop in a Marineland video as an alternative.Aside from the educational aspects of the place and the amazing views for whale watching, there is also an amphitheater and a banquet area with patio (ocean view) that can be rented out for weddings or other events after 5pm when the interpretive center closes. What a prime location to enjoy!",LvK
50,Whales and So Much More,"The park outside this center is just right for me: Walking trails, a breeze most of the time, plenty of local vegetation, incredible views and picnic tables. Once I finally went into the center, after a year of spending time at the park, I was truly surprised. The Interpretive Center is aptly named, as I came to understand the local ecology much better. It gave me a frame of reference, and basic knowledge of the history and geography. It certainly ignited a renewed sense of wanting to protect this amazing place; and the sea-life, plants, and animals that call it home. Drop in and enjoy the Marineland exhibit, too. Now when I'm in the park, I slip them a dollar or two in the donation bin. Let's grow that tradition.",christina_onthe_road
50,Great gem not far from Long Beach,"No whales spotted but a great afternoon out. Just great coastal scenery, nicely understated and a great picnic venue.",djp1961
50,Whale watchers galore,"We visited during the annual whale watch, and volunteers were having a great time! Although it was very cold, volunteers had been staffing the watch from sunup to dusk since the season had started in December. In addition to a great outdoor viewing area, the Center has wonderful exhibits about the Palos Verdes Peninsula and its surrounding ocean habitat. The Center also sponsors hikes led by trained volunteers/docents throughout the Palos Verdes canyons and to the tide pool areas in Palos Verdes. Great group of people doing a wonderful job to explain the local environment in an understandable manner. We took one of the tidepool tours ~ led by Cindy ~ and had a wonderful time: saw brittle stars, starfish, sea cucumbers, fish, bat stars, anemones, and urchins galore ~ but no octopi during our tour. Be sure to wear waterproof shoes (or ones you don't care about) if you take the tidepool tour, and be sure to wet your hands before handling any wildlife (under the docent's direction only, please!). It's a bit of a hike down to the tidepools, so be prepared for that ~ the path is well marked and clear of major obstructions, but it still down a cliff side! All in all, we had a great day, and would love to live closer so I could do it more often!",GlassInMS
50,Hidden Treasure,"A small museum that shows you the history of the peninsula, the geology, geography and, especially in winter, the whales.",BabaDi
30,A place to go Whale Watching,"The center itself is small, but informative. The real thrill is looking out over the Pacific Ocean with your binoculars and trying to spot humpback or California Grey Whales. There is also a hiking trail that goes over to a housing complex around multi-million dollar homes. There are picnic benches and if the weather permits, it is a nice place for a family get together.",Chris S
50,Fabulous stroll down memory lane for Marineland,"We had lunch at Nelson's at the Terranea resort which is on the old Marineland site and when we asked about the history of the park were directed to the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. I am glad we stopped. The exhibit of old Marineland artifacts, souvenirs, and photos was superb. There was a short video. The biggest delight was talking with a gentleman who was a docent and knew everything about the history of the park. Outside are beautiful views of the Pacific with trails along the bluff and great areas for picnics- with tables and shade trees to sit under. I would recommend stopping. We would have liked to see the lighthouse but it is open only on the 2nd Saturday of the month.",John T
40,Hidden Wonder,"In the beauty of the Los Angeles Palos Verdes peninsula, there is a hidden wonder called the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. The exhibits within are well laid out and are of interest to both young and old alike. The views from the walkways are spectacular. Bring your binoculars as this is a great place for catching a glimpse of migrating whales just off the coast.",Kaj898
50,Coastal views and pelicans,"I come to watch the pelicans soar overhead and look out at the dramatic coastline. The park offers walking trails along the cliffs edge and picnic tables. The Interpretive Center is a great, small museum (donations appreciated) which focuses on the gray whales that migrate past the peninsula, but, also includes the history of the area from its geology to original inhabitants. It is nicely done. Once a year, in March, they have a whale watching festival. This is a good place to watch for whales Dec-April. Bring binoculars and a camera whenever you come. Also nearby is the Point Vicente Lighthouse.",Lukeoline
50,One of the best coastal walks in LA County,"The museum is worth visiting, but the real reason people come here is too enjoy the beautiful coast. The views are spectacular, with rugged cliffs and a historic lighthouse, this site is perhaps the most picturesque coastline in LA county. The pleasant trail runs perhaps a mile and is a perfect place in the summer. The breeze is enjoyable and you will surely see numerous brown pelicans hovering near the cliff edge catching the wind. Like other reviews have mentioned whales are occassionaly seen.",kjmagnuson
40,nice small museum,likes- location on the point. the pelican migration. the geological history of the land. video on the whales of baja.,dziran
50,Great during whale watching season,"The trails surrounding the site are great for strolling, bird watching and enjoying the ocean view. I love watching the brown pelicans skim over the water. This is a popular dog walking location, too.The Center has good information regarding the whales that pass along the California coast. The best part are the volunteers that come to observe and count the whales as they migrate. They're friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about whales!",irenem k
40,Great views and nice info about Marineland,This is a nice stop to enjoy the ocean and learn more about what Marineland was like before it was closed. There are great vistas as well as nice park areas.,Jenipher L
40,Neat museum and whale watching spot.,"Saw California Grey whales migrating north, as well as Minke whales and dolphin. A terrific little museum with many mementos and photos of the old Marineland.",DannyO811
30,A short day trip,"If you have a couple of hours and you are in the Palos Verdes area, you might consider visiting the point Vicente light house and interpretive center. I first toured the lighthouse which is only open the second Saturday of each month. They let you walk up about 4 flights of stairs to the top. Once at the top it's warm with the sun shining through the windows. There is a beautiful view of the ocean as well. From there, you can walk next door to the interpretive center and tour their small museum. It's kept up well and the guides are very helpful/knowledgeable. We learned about Marineland and that it used to be housed on what we now know as Terranea. The guide told us some interesting stories about Marineland and how it was basically shut down overnight. All in all it takes about 90 minutes to 2 hours (if you take your time) to tour both facilities. There is also a park outside of the interpretive center with picnic tables if you would like to have a picnic. It's a fun quick trip if you are in the area.",Sungal43
40,A quick stop to complete the picture of Ranchos Palos Verdes,"The Center itself is very small, but well kept, and very well organized, with kind people giving adequate information about the place, about Ranchos Verdes.And... if you stay long enough at the terrace, and if you are lucky, you might see whales ( from October to April).At the left side of the Center, you will see the lighthouse.We stopped over for half an hour, learned quite a few things, and took a few pretty photos.",HowQute
40,Make sure you pull in here,"Great views over the Pacific and southern California to the south. A nice place to go near sunset and a pretty lighthouse there too. Wide open roads to get there. About 15/20 minutes tops from the beaches of Torrance/Redondo etc. Not quite sure how far south we could make out; I'm thinking maybe Long Beach? Anyway easy to get to (Route 1). Not an all day thing, but a good half hour/40 minutes or so around sunset just watching the waves, the sunset and feeling good about the world.",Antony T

50,Incredible area...saw lots of blue whales...,Incredible area...saw lots of blue whales spoutin g last week...great nature trails...picnic area could not be better. Truly an amazing location.!,caminla
40,Grand view of SoCal Coast and Whales too,"The interpretive center is nice, and frequently has knowledgeable as well as enthusiastic docents ready to provide a leasurely and informative tour of the facility. It also has a gift store with medium to high-level artistic memoribilia in the cetacean genre.The grounds are really worth the visit. It is well kept, with paths surrounding the interpretive center and ample parking. There are a few picnic tables sprinkled along the bluff path and a few signs cautioning visitors about the possibility of rattle snakes. We visited on a windy day and found a blanket on one fo the grass fields to be the most confortable picnic location.In addition to the the light house, the interpretive center, and the the attractive location, a organization of whale watchers frequently use the facility to spot migrating whales. If you are interested in whale watching, you may find kindred spirits among the visitors and might even learn something about currently visiting species.A good visit.",s2global
30,See the whales from December to April,"The ""museum"" itself is actually quite small and doesn't have much, but it's right above the cliffs and has amazing views of the peninsula. December through April is whale watching season and there are often a few sightings a day during those times, but you should probably bring binoculars because they'll probably be about a small speck from the viewing location on the cliffs. This is probably a nice quiet place to have a picnic and do some whale watching (though you may have to spend several hours there before seeing anything) if you don't have much else to do.",mstinawu
