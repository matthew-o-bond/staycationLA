50,my shoe tree,"hello my name is Ricardo Brambila and I placed every single shoe on those trees. Not only did i provide art I gave the area a new name ""The Shoe Tree"" I hope you like it.",Rich B
40,Walking the dogs,We enjoyed the trails East of the parking lot. Not crowded and saw some interesting old construction we heard there were uncontrolled dogs west of the parking lot.There is a tree there that has many pairs of shoes hanging from the branches.,Judy J
50,Nice walking trail,This is a great little walking trail. If you are traveling the 138 through Palmdale. This is a great little spot to get out and stretch you legs. It is dog friendly as well.,bigdady5840
10,Not a Barrel of Fun,"Barrell Springs TrailPalmdaleThis was probably a good ides when it was set up, but the parking lot and area is, in my opinion, not safe. There are several geocaches in the area, but I was uncomfortable parking there or walking into the wilderness near there.",Robert P
40,Good walk!,"Good walk to take. Nearly 3 miles round trip. Only two hills, not too hard. Lovely open scenery. Quiet. Not crowded. Will definitely recommend and visit again.",Marisa
40,Peaceful and comforting walk,"Too bad many people does not care keeping the trail clean. I've seen it become a recipient of people's trash over the years. I volunteered to collect trash in large plastic bags while walking, and at least someone noticed a good action, hopefully other people will follow suit and help clean up what used to be an almost virgin landscape.",Tipmore
30,Great equestrian hills and trail.....,I ride the trail often and its a good workout for the horses. There is an equestrian arena at the north end of the trail with lots of parking for groups. The trail is fairly well maintained and the only negative I can point out is the occasional dirt bike rider that races thru there. The entire area needs additional attention of local law enforcement to curtail this and illegal dumping nearby.,Brett P
40,Great little hike to stretch your legs.,Took the kids out for a nice walk. Saw quite a bit of wildlife. It can be as long as you like or as short as you like.,mm1970
50,Roller coaster hike,"Definitely a fun place to hike. The trail resembles roller coaster tracks because of it's slopes. The road is curvy and can be a bit scary if you are afraid of heights. You get great views of the mountains and the city on this hike. There is a convenient little parking lot off of barrel springs/25th and pearblossom hwy. Easy to find and a somewhat moderate hike. Make sure to protect yourself from the sun, bring water, and wear good shoes.",Cyndee L
40,Hiking in AV,This is an easy hike. It doesn't have lots of steep hills and I believe is not long. You walk to the end and back. A great beginners hike to start with.,carmencJ9862ET
50,Nice way to get your heart rate up!,Young lady at the hotel I was staying at told me about this hike. It's an out and back that I clocked from parking area and back at almost 3 miles. It has several decent little climbs but mostly it flat and granular. Beautiful views and there were at least 40 people that I passed all out getting fresh air and exercise.,jimvet1826
50,Nice trail for all,"Such a beautiful location. Trail is dog friendly, kid friendly, and horse friendly. Steep enough to get a good workout at a fast pace, but not too strenuous. With little kids, you may want to turn around about the halfway point so they don't poop out. There are not any restrooms nearby so that should be considered as well. Bring plenty of water and keep your eyes open-- this is still the desert!",DestinationLancaster
50,Great trail to walk my dogs for an hour of excercise.,"I use this trail to walk my dogs & get an hour of exercise for me & my fur babies. You see nature at its best; rabbits, hawks, the beauty of the flower when they bloom in springs. You don't have to worry about a little trail, and stepping all over one another. I have 3 large dogs, and the trail is wide for all of us to walk together - great trail!",925darleent
50,Great place to walk,A really great trail! There are some steep hills. It is a great way to see the desert landscape and get fit.,krisred2363
50,Beautiful Trail Close to Home,"I love this trail. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, The trail goes up and down, up and down. You'll get your work out on this view filled trail. The whole loop takes about an hour. The people on it are generally very friendly.It's a great place to go and you can take your dogs.I do wish they would provide doggie bags and garbage cans because irresponsible dog owners let their dogs poop on the trail. Maybe if they were provided with baggies these people would pick up after their dogs. We wind up kicking poop off the trail so others won't step in it.Come on, people, take pride in our recreational areas!",Off2SeeItAll
40,Nice little nature walk,Good way to see the flora and fauna of the High Desert area. Especially lovely in the Spring when the poppies bloom. Joggers and bikers welcome but nothing motorized. Quiet and peaceful.,Lauralyn K
40,Beautiful,Good trail for walking or jogging depending on your abilities. For those more energetic hiking is also an enjoyable exercise.I enjoyed the view of the sun coming up and not being overcrowded by others,livin42day
50,Scenic hiking trail,"This place is awesome for jogging and outdoor exercising. The scenery is really stunning and the air (in the mornings) is very crisp, which makes the little outdoor path that much more enjoyable. Dogs are allowed, so lots of people bring them.",Diandra M
50,Great little hiking trail,"This is a quite from a local article. "" Palmdale Barrel Springs Trail: The City of Palmdale in partnership with the AV Heritage Foundation and the Antelope Valley Trails Recreation and Environmental Council was awarded $415,152 in Prop A money to build this trail. This 1 1/2 mile of trail will be used as a backbone trail for the Antelope Valley."" This trail is frequented by day hikers and people riding horses. U can start from either end of the trail. The other entrance is off of Sierra Hwy and Barrel Springs rd and has horse trailer parking.",LA_Deputy
