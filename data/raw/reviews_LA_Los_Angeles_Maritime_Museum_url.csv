50,Interesting Little Museum,A lovely little museum and a 5 dollar entrance fee. The staff are all volunteers and are very helpful and friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattC5511
40,Interesting Stop,"I have been to many maritime museums and this one is really interesting, though small. For a museum that doesn't actually have any ships, just models and displays, it is set up nicely and has a lot to look at. There is a gentleman on the top floor with a short-wave radio, in contact with people all over the world. He was worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callan1034
50,Great History of the L.A. Port,"When I was growing up, the San Pedro fish canneries supplied tuna to the nation. This museum documents that aspect of the harbor area as well as much more. Great photos, wonderful exhibits and beautiful scale replicas of ships. Recommend it very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kittygal
40,An interesting bargain,"$5 to get in ($3 for seniors). Lots of history as to how LA developed as a port - lumber, fishing etc. lots of ship models. An interesting exhibit on how 3000 Japanese were central to the fishing/canning industry... until they were thrown out at the start of WE II. Close to the other attraction - the battleship Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgerhardt
50,Wonderful model ship collection,"We visited with adult family. The model ships are exquisite, from the USS Nimitz to Francis Drakes Golden Hind (A full scale replica of which may be seen on the London waterfront), to the tugboat Penny. Play area for children at the top of the walk .A nice find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531paulinek
40,GOOD AND FREE,"First off, it is free, however, when you walk in you are greeted by a seated attendant and on the desk are the prices! Not entrance fee, but suggested donation, which I think most people interpret as an admission charge when they approach the desk.Mostly static exhibits and hundreds of beautiful ship models. Not sure it is the best thing for kids, unless they are adamant model builders. For ship and boat lovers and history buffs it is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennisw354
50,A must see,"Take time to visit and spend an hour or so to see this history. Many great ships to see, a vast history of military",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mainzer
40,Free & Fun,"Los Angeles Maritime Museum is free admission and fun for everyone a large collection of model warships and historic items on display. Many of the ships featured have local significance, including; the U.S.S. Los Angeles, U.S.S. Long Beach, U.S.S. San Pedro, and the S.S. San Pedro.Another area of the museum contains a display of modern-day merchant shipping. A variety of models are on display, including cargo ships, container ships, and tankers. This is a great place for a history lesson to learn about past ships life.SCHOONERS Dozens were built on the West Coast after 1860 to carry lumber to the ports of the world.Just fabulous displays of model ships..4 Stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogonblick
40,Interesting combination of local maritime history and models,"We visited this museum having been unable to get on to the USS Iowa (which had been closed for a special event). Considering that it was an unplanned visit it worked out well and there was enough to interest us for a couple of hours.The exhibits cover the history of the port and local fishing industry well. There are a considerable number of models of ships and boats too, as well as a 'radio ham' studio set up on the upper floor.Good points:+ Interesting combination of exhibits+ Spacious and light interiorNot so good points:- The 'suggested donation' arrangement is misleading, the staff at the entrance seem to treat this as a fixed entrance fee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000
30,Local maritime museum,"A museum, near the Battleship Iowa, has interesting displays concerning the Los Angeles Harbor and the history of the harbor of things that no longer exist. One is the fishing industry and canning facilities on Terminal Island. It is in the old Ferry Building that was the access to the island before the bridges were built.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobandmargieg
40,A local orientation,"A small maritime museum, with exhibits on the local history of the fishing industry and on local deep sea diving. Nicely done. Also a number of model ships of all sizes. Some of the museum is being improved/developed further. A deck out back enables you to see a portion of the harbor. The museum also has a tug (not used as such) that goes out periodically - we were not able to do that. Street parking only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
40,Very informative,"Quite a small museum but full of model ships from all over the world . Very interesting section on the local history of the fish canning industry . Large section dedicated to children , well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffb21
50,"Suggested Donation, Worth Your Time","This museum is not free, there is actually a suggested donation of $5/each to enter.It's a really cool place and the lower level has a lot of the history about San Pedro and the fishing and canning industry. The upper level has really cool model boats, ships and a cute kids area.Depending on your interest in nautical history and model boats, ships you could spend anywhere from 30 minutes to 2+ hours here.I went here with a five-year-old and he enjoyed looking at the models as we walked past but we went direct to the kids area where we spent about 20 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,Fun and Free,Just near Battleship USS IOWA between Long Beach and L.A is San Pedro and the Port.The Maritime Museum has free entry with a strongly suggested donation of $5.you can find three handicapped and three general parking in front of the building or park at the Mexican restaurant next door.Its a small maritime museum with large models of older boats. Navy or Nautical fans are sure to enjoy. I would say you can enjoy it for 90 after the battleship and lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimDeBerry
50,What a pleasant surprise!,Not expecting much - but was really surprised! A great history of the LA Harbor area and Terminal Island as well.Excellent displays! Fantastic models of ships.Great place for children to learn.Fantastic tour guides!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vermeling
50,A gem!,"A lady friend of mine who has grown up in southern California was driving me around in Long Beach. She was very familiar and experienced with so much that this area has to offer; yet, she had never been to the Los Angeles Maritime Museum.What an outstanding surprise! We were both taken aback by the miniature/ replica boats and their history. The presentation of the deep sea divers was excellent.This is not a large museum by museum standards; yet one easily spend a few hours as we did.I highly recommend a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justme54481
30,"Nice, but not as good as it could be","Once again, a great but cluttered museum has been ‘over-slicked’, at least in my opinion. I remember a very cluttered but magnificent collection with massive amounts of old photos in the ‘old’ museum. The new museum is very brightly lit and un-cluttered with a lot of open space. The exhibit on the rise and fall of the tuna industry was great, but filled a huge area of the first floor. There was a great collection of both models and, in the case of the nuclear sub ‘Los Angeles’ actual large artifacts. This area was closed but we were allowed in there as I am retired military. The rest of the museum is, in my opinion, too ‘slick’ and underwhelming. Bring back more of the actual historical photos that show what the ‘Flying Cloud’ really looked like in life and how its great speed changed things. That is just one of at least 100 examples I could suggest. Some of the old ‘clutter’ would, in my opinion, do a great deal toward reviving some of the true glory of the ‘old’ museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flutepilot
50,Small but Nice,We had some time to burn before starting our cruise and saw this museum. Turned out to be better than we thought. a lot of very interesting history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidLowe0228
50,Nice museum,This small museum is really nice.Ticket is only for 5 USD and it takes about one hour tour.You can see many ships and all other staff about fishing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knighteycz
50,Educational for young and old alike,"We spent about three hours browsing through this state of the art museum highlighting not only a room filled with naval ship models and relics, but also terrific displays of the fishing and fish cannery industries that helped to support Los Angeles from the beginning to near the end of the 20th Century. The ship models and small ships lining the walkway to the second floor were also outstanding. The second floor has an interactive hands on children's section among the other displays of maritime navigation, communication, and marine relics. This is a great opportunity and very near the Battleship Iowa so you could easily tour both in a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregS14
50,San Pedro California-Maritime Museum,"After visiting the IWOA, Ports O'Call or anything else in Sam Pedro, stop in at the Museum. This built used to be the ferry terminal to Catalina Island. Now a Museum. My first time there. Snap, cute, enjoyed it plan about 30-60 minutes , don't need more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbrodsly
40,pair LA Maritime museum with visit to very nearby battleship Iowa,"Museum focuses on the maritime history of LA (of course). Lots of ship models but also lots of ships equipment. A full working tugboat.Display office knots, scrimmage and tattoos. A children's area. Back door opens to deck where you can sit and look at the harbor. This is a museum built in 1980 so don't expect the fancy pushbutton stuff of newer museums but very educational. I didn't give it five stars because of low energy from the front desk staff..but maybe they are volunteers.Visit the battleship Iowa then take a left out of the parking lot and the maritime down the street with free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Lady_456
30,"If you have never been here, it is worth a look.","This is a great museum dedicated to the Port of Los Angles. There are lots of ship models and lots of historic photo's. There are plaquards everywhedre telling about the history of the port.Here is the problem, the last time I visited the museum was just over ten years ago and for the most part it has not changed at all. There are some renovations taking place in the military section to add more models. The current exhibit, The Art Of The Scrimshaw is okay but not really that fascinating. The puzzling thing (unless I missed it) is that I did not see anything at all about the USS Iowa being brought in as a museum! You would think that would be a big deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creeker000
50,Well Worth a Visit,"A maritime museum of artifacts and remarkable ship models,With friendly knowledgeable staff. Museum is near the USS Iowa and Cruise ship pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertM929
30,Odd little museum but a nice peek at local past,"This is a ""suggested donation"" museum ($3 per adult). The most intriguing thing about it is that its the former ferry terminal - pre Vincent Thomas Bridge it serviced the folks working on Terminal Island every day. That made the building fun to explore and exhibits are well designed around that flow. As for exhibits themselves, wooden boats and ship models aren't my cup of tea, but I did very much enjoy understanding what built and subsequently happened to the Port of LA Economy (sardines, tuna, canneries -- I never knew!) and the military history is a nice prologue to visiting the Iowa next door. Certainly worth $3 and an hour on a rainy day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigthm
40,enjoyable surprise,"I'd never heard of this museum, but it was offered as a free visit on Smithsonian's Museum Day this year and we were in the area, so decided to check it out. Some very nice examples of wooden boats, lots of models, and interesting information regarding the areas past. I didn't know canneries were once such a large part of the regions livelihood.Really enjoyed speaking with the volunteer in the radio room - told us all about communicating with vessels at sea and ham radio operation. There is a patio area on the dock and the sea lions were visiting that afternoon, also across from a very busy dock with the huge crains unloading a ship, a little bit of everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellz61
50,Great Exhibits,This museum is a highlight of visiting San Pedro. A wonderful history of the commercial fishing and maritime industry of the area. Very reasonable entry fee.Tie this museum with visits to the nearby USS Iowa and the S.S. Lane Victory and you will have over 150 years of history all within walking distance of downtown San Pedro.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winddancerone
40,Add to your places to visit at the Port of LA,"In San Pedro, there is something for everyone. The LA Maritime Museum is not big but there is a ton of history there and the model ships on display are some of the best I've ever seen. There is also an interest little plaza in front. You can combine a visit to the Maritime Museum with a visit to the USS Iowa, Ports of Call, and the LAFD Historical Society's Old Fire Station 36 Museum, all in one day. And, there are plenty of places to eat nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Great place to visit,"I got the idea to go the after visiting USS Iowa, found out they have the mast from USS Los Angeles CL-135 there. After asking around I got the chance to fly my US Flag from that Mast.Another place my flag got to visit . The museum itself is a stand alone attraction and is well worth the visit . If you are a history buff this place is wonderful , hoping to do a podcast from there soon when I get done with a little more researchThis is worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s3production
40,Wonderful Models of Ships in a Tidy Modest Museum in San Pedro,"The first thing one should know about this museum is that it is not in Los Angeles. It is in San Pedro, which is about 40 minutes south. It is not far from Long Beach. It is a terrific small museum and has some wonderful models of ships. It's a must do for anyone interested in boats or ships : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewindatourfeet
50,It was ok.,When I went there it was fun. But there was model ships replicas. But the ocean view was nice. Since the USS iowa came I think it has more business,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubasean1023
40,Great 1 hour diversion.,"Didn't really plan to stay, but with a $3 admission & $1 for seniors, I though what the heck. Some great models, photography, history here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davesondeck
50,Hidden South Bay Pearl,"I thought this was an excellent little museum, especially for the price. (It's free.) There are a couple of dioramas on the deep-sea diving profession, a life-size display of the bridge of a battleship and a shortwave radio station, but the main collection is of model ships. There must be an example of just about every vessel that's ever floated. Some are extremely large and incredibly detailed. I thought it was very well-done, especially for a place that's so obscure. There's an old tugboat docked behind the museum, but,alas, you can't go onboard. If you happen to be in San Pedro or Long Beach it's worth checking out the Maritime Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booradley2
