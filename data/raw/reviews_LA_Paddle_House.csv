50,Friendly,"We rented paddle boards having never tried this before. We got a nice and concise lesson which helped us figure out how to stand and paddle right away. There is plenty of colorful fish and sea life to see around the little harbor. I would definitely wait for a calm day, both for ease of paddling and clear water.",flammulated
50,The perfect ending to a perfect vacation,"Our last morning in Southern California and we were looking for a paddleboarding experience that didn't require rentals for half or full day, convenient location, and relatively easy for first-timers. The staff and crew at Paddle House were super friendly and helpful, and committed to us having a good time! Lots of fun paddling by the seals in the harbor and lots of fish to see. Easy to park and great location overall. We'll definitely come back!",kathleencb2017
40,Fun way to see Sea Lions,"We rented paddleboards and got boards in good condition for a reasonable price. The people were very pleasant and helpful. We stayed in the harbor area with them and really enjoyed being able to see the dozens of sea lions sunning themselves on a raft.Very enjoyable day, followed by great seafood just down the boardwalk.",Mike L
