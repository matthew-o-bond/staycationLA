40,Solid dive bar in the heart of Culver City,Ended up here by chance with a work colleague after we finished a project near by. We were there on a Wednesday night and the clientele was pretty eclectic. Everybody kept to themselves more or less and the bartender poured a heavy drink. I am from the Midwest and I was surprised to see all of the Packers paraphernalia on the walls. If you like dive bars and you're in the area...check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwmesq

30,McLovin’ from the Superbad movie,"This bar features in the movie “Superbad” and is where McLovin’ ends up on a night out. I went to check it out, for that reason, but I didn’t stay for a drink as it was too filthy for my liking. However, I don’t want to rate this place less than 3 stars BECAUSE, the bar is not trying to be something it’s not. It is a dive bar and if you like dive bars, you might like this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionao315

40,Repast,My partners grandmother passed away and the repast was at the mortuary. The entire family needed a drink to relax after so we went to the Tattle Tale. Great decision. I'm very picky about my scotch and don't normally frequent neighborhood bars because they never have a decent selection. I was pleasantly surprised! Everyone here was super friendly and or party of 10+ had a great time. Great jukebox too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chase1970
50,My favorite bar in LA,"Super friendly, nice people and most importantly Non-pretentious. Karaoke every night, inexpensive drinks, everyone welcome. A place for blacks, whites, Hispanics, gay, straight, you name it. Magic happens here after 8 or 9.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrockDallas
