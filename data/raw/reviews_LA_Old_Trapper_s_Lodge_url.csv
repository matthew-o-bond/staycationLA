40,Really sad because of the maintenance needed,"I was so pleased to find these statues and fake grave markers. In a little corner beside the road into Pierce College.I had read that there was an unknown group who looked after this quaint piece of history. Clearly they have lost interest, which is really sad. One lady has lost an arm, and everything needs more than just a coat of paint.If there was a fund to improve the situation, I'd like to add a little to it - and I live in the UK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevetupper
50,Amazing folk art,"I grew up just down the street from the Old Trapper's Lodge, which was a solid piece of Americana along San Fernando Road in Burbank, then Highway 99. Unfortunately the site was right next to a runway for Burbank Airport, which tore down the log cabin motel in the 1980s for a storage facility. They did rescue many large wood sculptures of pioneers and Indians carved by the owner over the years, some made from telephone poles; the sculptures are now in a corner of the agricultural fields of Pierce College.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsmog310
50,wonderfully wacky,"Old Trapper John's Lodge is the California State Registered Landmark #939, Twentieth Century Folk Art Environment. It's a collection of rustic statues and hilarious ""tombstones"" from a place the sculptor created, named Boot Hill, an old western town in the late 1800's.This is a not-to-be-missed attraction, one that even the locals don't know about. I used aerial maps to get some idea of where exactly it was on the Pierce College campus, since the students and staff have no idea it's there. It's out El Rancho toward DeSoto - the DeSoto gate is closed, so you must enter from Winnetka and drive to the left, curve right around the Performing Arts area, turn left on El Rancho, beyond a huge gate, to the site just to the left of a low building with a tile roof.Expect to spend at least half an hour, maybe more if you want to read all the funny tombstones.To read about it, go to -------- and several more websites, some with more extensive photos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonaccidentaltourist
