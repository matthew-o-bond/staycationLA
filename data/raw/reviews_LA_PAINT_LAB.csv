40,Great way to spend an evening!,"We went here for a Friday night out in los angeles while we were visiting. It was very fun and all the staff was very friendly and helpful. Tony and Laura were fabulous! It is a great place for all skill levels who just want to have fun. I like that the pieces were challenging and not simple like a lot of other paint places.The only negative that I can share is that they charge you a lot on Friday nights (maybe less on other nights). Snacks and drinks are included, but the snacks are mediocre and they only have one type of white and red and not very good wine.",Monicaicequeen
50,Fun & creative way to spend the afternoon!,Paint Lab is a super fun and creative place!The staff are friendly and the instructors are patient and encouraging.I didn't believe that I could ever create a beautiful painting.We had a wonderful time and I can't wait to go back.,misschrisritchie
50,A great couples activity,"We recently when to paint lab for their wine, cheese, and painting with instruction and had a wonderful time! We now have competing paintings of sunflowers up in our living room, and love to compare how different they ended up.Good value for the price.",Gregory G
40,Great idea!,"On Fri & Sat evening (6-9) & Sunday for brunch, you pay about $30 plus cost of the canvas you choose & then paint to your hearts content for a couple of hours or more. It's a very relaxing way to spend a few hours and do that painting you've always wanted to try, in enjoyable surrounds.Get down to this part of Santa too, it's south more interesting and cool than the chain stores in town; I promise you'll love the shopping, cafes, bars & restaurants along Main St, they're just fabulous!",Snaz
40,Great way to spend the evening and exercise your creativity,"A friend and I signed up for their Wine, Cheese and Paint class. It was a great way to spend a few hours on Sunday. The venue is a great little house right on Main Street in Santa Monica. They provide everything for you...all the paint, brushes, easel, canvas(you can purchase more if you are inspired to continue painting), plus the wine and cheese in this particular class. Enjoyed meeting everyone that worked there, and especially enjoyed meeting Martin, our instructor for the evening. Not only did I walk away inspired to continue painting, but was such a great little oasis in the middle of Santa Monica. Would highly recommend it for couples, a girls night out, or just for someone wanting a change of scenery or something new, fun and different to do!",bchgrrrl
