50,Great Finds,"I ways stop by when I visit Cali. I always find some great things here! I normally stop by to pick up some inexpensive peacock ore, but this place is huge. I would normally spend about an hour in here checking out all the items for sale. This place will definitely take you down memory lane. This is definitely worth visiting. And the pricing is great.",nlott414
30,Few Actual Antiques,"Pasadena Antique Mall is like a high end garage or estate sale with vintage and antique items mixed in. In my opinion, new items/mass produced products insult the integrity of an antique store and nowadays it's hard to find antique malls that don't have dealer booths with new, non-antique goods. This one is no exception.",jillsthename
50,Fun to browse,"This place is fab! Fun to browse after strolling around this extensive outdoor mall or enjoying lunch. Chock full of interesting treasures of all price ranges. They also give estimates on your antiques/ collectibles for $5 on certain days, check their website.",516madelines
40,Cute shop,"I enjoyed poking through this shop this afternoon. I don't go in to antique stores looking for something specific but I could have walked it with a few nice things if I wasn't having a ""no spend"" day. I would go back for another visit if I was in the area. It was a nice quiet activity on a Saturday afternoon.",tink8009
40,Cute shop to browse but not cheap,The parking is free for 90 minutes and it is not just for the Pasadena Antique Mall but for the other part of the Mall as well. It is filled with items and it has various small spaces. Quite cool to see if you like vintage but it is pricey.,laurapoint
50,Excellent antique shop with movie memorabilia and much more,"Really neat antique store. An expansive variety that can include everything from a stereo turnatable receiver combo and victrolas to movie memorabilia, collectibles, clothing, and artwork. If you are looking for something to do for even a half hour or so, we'll worth the trip. You never know what you'll find.",Edward D
40,Very cool antique shop,"I had visited this shop a couple of years ago & knew I'd have to come back to browse. It's a really large space with a lot to look at. Lots of retro/ vintage books, toys, clothes, furniture, & nic knacks. I saw a lot of stuff I'd buy but either I have no way to put them in my luggage, although I'm sure they'd ship (not sure), or some items are very expensive. But very much worth looking just to sense a rich history. So lovely.",WickedCakes
40,Hollywood buffs will appreciate,"Antique mall with numerous mini-shops, all with their own personality. Many were vintage Hollywood-themed. (Not what we were specifically looking for.) Prices seemed high, but in line with a shop that has a downtown address...not geared toward bargain-hunters.",Sandra L
40,Impressed on my First Visit.,"Stopped in here while waiting to meet friends for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Very organized, neat, fairly clean. Which I have found isn't always the case when visiting antique stores.While I didn't buy anything (whew!), it was interesting to walk around and view the various dealers' wares. It's a rather large area to cover and they had some interesting items. If I had more time, perhaps I would have made a purchase, but I would definitely re-visit when I'm in town again.Not a bad place to kill some time...or shop!",jahhp
40,Really fun history! Kids love it,"We visited the Antique mall in Pasadena on a nice Sunday afternoon. This place is situated right next to a large mall with a lot of stores and restaurants.This place is really fun! Once you walk inside it feels like walking back in time. They have lots of sections and it is nice that they have things like in categories.Our kids loved to see all this incredible very useful thins and we got a great opportunity to talk about how life has change and how life is now different because of technology.They also have a Lots of movie memorabilia and props. Remember everything is for sale. They had the original glasses that Marilyn Monroe used in a movie.The employees are super friendly and you can handle most of the stuff.We loved the section with old lightbulbs. They are lit and you can see this magical display.We sat in an area full with old books. That was really fun for our two kids, as you can find these books in a regular library.We saw old typewriters, cameras and lots of beautiful art. It felt like a museum that you can touch the displays. Towards the end of our visit we sat and saw lots of old pictures. Ah, I almost forgot - the jewelry cases are great.Take a trip back in time with the family and enjoy a history afternoon.",lxjuarez
30,Kind of like a thrift store rather than an antique store,"As I browsed the store, I was a little surprised to see some of the items for sale. There were many beautiful items that definitely belong in an antique store, but then there were lots of everyday type things that you would more expect to see in a thrift store, but they were expensive. It is huge, though, and there were lots of things to look through, so I still think it's worth visiting.",hotwheels84
40,"""Worth the visit""",Great place to visit. They have a lot of nice nick/nacks and antiques at a reasonable price. They have everything organized by themes and some by years.,vacationfamily05
50,Best Antique Store Ever!,"This is a place to find quality antiques at resonable prices. I could have spent hours in there! The store is huge! They ship, if you can't take it home with you. They have everything--jewelry, furniture, books, clothes, records, etc. don't miss it!",annarc6
40,Spot the bargain,I wandered through here on Saturday and wish I had more time available. Sure there were some expensive items but there were also bargain tables available. Unfortunately I couldn't take advantage as my luggage quota was full but I will definitely keep room for some on my next trip.,Albywon
40,Rummage sale on steroids,"I live in the neighborhood so I am familiar with most of the antique stores in the area. This place has a variety of stuff I consider more garage sale material than true antiques. The items on sale are by consignment so the prices are on the higher side. Nevertheless, I found a lot of interesting items that brought me back to my childhood days. A good place to spend an afternoon and even buy a unique gift for a friend. Check it out!",Gforce411
40,Giant store,"If you like shopping antiques and collectibles this is the place for you. It's five times the size I imagined from the outside. Had friends in town who love do it yourself projects and ""junking"" and they spent hours inside.",Tori L
50,Nice Assortment of Everything,"We liked this antique mall a lot. The staff was helpful and friendly. It has a nice mix of things. The parking is pay parking but the staff can validate your ticket. Again, they were very helpful.",Mark R
50,Really Enjoyed the Stop,"My daughter and I were in Pasadena from out of town for dinner and decided to make a stop at Paseo Colorado before we ate. I had been to this lovely outdoor mall before and had remembered it to be nice. However, I thought there were more shops than there were and was a bit disappointed at the sparse selection of affordable places. There were a lot of high end (read...out-of-our-price-range) places and several nice restaurants but not much in the way of normal shopping haunts. We then spotted this antique store and decided we would make a stroll through. I thoroughly enjoyed walking around as their stock was quite extensive. I enjoyed it not just because they had some very nice looking antiques on display but they also had a lot of items that I would consider to be Americana-type merchandise. There were especially a lot of things I could remember from my childhood and into my early adult life such as movie memorabilia and toys. I am looking forward to the time when I am in Pasadena again and can make another visit.",Debbie K
30,Stopped in a looked around.,"I am from the east coast and frequent antiques stores in our area. While in Pasadena we saw this store and figured we would check it out. To me it didn't seem to have a lot of antiques, a lot of the stuff seem newer to me. The prices also seemed to be a bit on the higher end for everything in the store.",E Viz
50,Simply the Best,"Pasadena Antique Mall is enormous, with rooms upon rooms of antiques and collectibles. There are numerous items varying from books & records (both older and modern), period clothing & accessories, toys, knick-knacks and art. There is even a section dedicated to authentic movie and TV show props, including Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sex and the City, The Brady Bunch and The Golden Girls, just to name a few.It is definitely a place to visit if you're in the area looking for something interesting to do. I know that I would have come home with a lot more items if excess baggage fees on flights didn't exist!",quinni_224
