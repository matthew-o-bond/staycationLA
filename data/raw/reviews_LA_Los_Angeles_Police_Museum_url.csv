50,Police Museum,Fantastic museum dedicated to early LAPD history. My favorite are the vintage police vehicles but the prisons inside are fascinating too.I highly recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertrP5180JE
50,Bloody fantastic!,"This museum really is a hidden gem in LA. Not very well known, and goodness knows why. The collection they have which showcases the work of the LAPD is incredible. You can view the cells, for different types of inmates, you can appreciate women working int he LAPD, with walls adorned with many photos. You can see the old criminal photo chairs with the letters, and have your photo taken on them. You can read about the Symbionese Liberation Army events and the North America shoot out in 1997. You can go into the parking lot and view many police are throughout the years, which are in remarkable condition, ranging from LAPS cars, to bomb squad vehicles and even a police helicopter. You can also see cars with real bullet holes, which really drives home how dangerous it can be. They also showcase many different types of handcuffs, uniforms and whole lot of other items. This place really should be one of the top things to do in LA. They have a wonderful audio guide which is part of the entrance fee. Excellent and really interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sephirothseviltwin
50,History in Time.,The exhibits here had impact on the whole world. This museum was revived to celebrate that heritage. With tremendous collections of memorabilia the museum's ever-changing exhibitions are sure to spark the imagination of both young and old. Call on the staff to walk you around. Their incredibly knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildman5858
40,Surprisingly interesting!,"Visited in mid-June due to strange weather (rain) that changed our plans--and found this place to be totally worth the time! Very, very interesting place--well done exhibits and much more than expected. If you grew up in California there is a lot of history here that you will remember--ie SLA, Patty Hearst, Adam-12, Dragnet, etc. So a mix of real and Hollywood. You get a audio device that tells you about the various exhibits. We spent about 90 minutes there--which was just right. If you really want to read everything--then it would be much longer. If your in the area--check it out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chesterchandler
40,"Educational, Worth the Visit, especially with kids.","The retired policemen on the premises are only too happy to share information about the museum and the exhibits. I think the building was rehabilitated and the museum opened about 17 years ago. There are several rooms dedicated to the SLO and Patty Hearst. If you like cars, there are several old police cars and vehicles, some paddles with bullets. There is a helicopter that kids can get behind the wheel in. I think in a world where so many don‚Äôt trust the police, this is a good place to go to maybe change your viewpoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
30,LA cop museum is worth an hour,"I only just discovered this museum and I've lived in LA close to 50 years. Has some great old cop cars, and a collection of handcuffs ranging from way long ago for the LAPD up to taser ones. There is also a collection of badges, and some uniforms. Too many rooms dedicated to coverage of the Symbianese Liberation Army and Patty Hearst, and too much coverage of the shootout in North Hollywood that happened about a decade ago. Best thing was the ability to take a ""mug"" shot with the old ID numbers, pictures in the jail cells, and also next to a 1920s-era cop car. Great cute lunch place nearby called Jane's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinymomkaren
30,Very Good But Missing a Key Exhibit,"Overall this is a very well done museum. It likely would interest most people, but especially if you have an interest in policing or true crime. Housed in a beautiful historic police station, one highlight is the original jail cells that you can enter. Also of particular interest is the selection of historic police vehicles including a cruiser and suspect vehicle from the famed North Hollywood Bank of America robbery. There are also two bomb squad vehicles and a helicopter.The second floor houses a historic uniform gallery and three ‚Äútrue crime‚Äù exhibits on the North Hollywood Bank of America robbery, the Symbionese Liberation Army, and the Onion Fields police kidnapping. All three are very well done, although the broken video screen in the North Hollywood exhibit certainly lessened the information available, as even the audio tour directs you to the video screen for more information.With all that said, I was very disappointed there was nothing dealing with the LAPD‚Äôs historic issues with communities of color in LA, especially in the 1980s leading up to the riots and the Rodney King beating. Not only does the Museum ignore this entirely, it also glorifies Chief Darryl Gates in multiple places, with no mention of the numerous critiques of his tenure.I‚Äôm not suggesting the Museum should not focus mostly on the glory of the LAPD‚Äôs history, but to ignore its less noble history does a disservice to the community. Most museums understand it is vital to also address the blemishes of their subject, and to provide historical context for those issues.The Museum is still worth visiting but don‚Äôt expect anything in the exhibits that doesn‚Äôt glorify the LAPD.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gusfamgoes
50,Fabulous Museum,"This museum was a surprise for us, it was fantastic in everyway! The exhitbits are well organized... Room to room & well documented. They have the original jail cells and you can grab a selfie or family photo. In the outside yard there was vintage police cars and assalt vehicles.... Volunteers wore vintage Police uniforms....What a great day!!!!Enjoyed by a less than 40 & a more than 60 year old ...üëçüòé",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,LAPD Experience,"A really interesting and informative museum that covers many different aspects of the history of the LAPD. The small and compact museum has loads of original exhibits on all aspects of policing in LA. There is a very good display on the North Hollywood Shootout - complete with the original bullet ridden police car and bank robbers car in the outside display area. The accompanying video presentation was both fascinating and scary at the same time !! The museum also has great displays on the SLA revolutionary group of the 1970s and the notorious Onion Field killings. The museum caters for the inquisitive, as well as the curious/interested visitor and for a $9 entry fee (for adults, less for children) it really is excellent value for money with anyone remotely interested in the darker side of the city of angels",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hreed95
50,Great Experience,"This museum was perfect ! My 9 yr old son loved it! the displays of the history of the LAPD was very interesting, I personally learned new facts, and enjoyed the museum. I highly recommend this museum. The Hollywood Bank of America Heist, room, was amazing !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaidersFam661
50,Good museum about the L.A.P.D.,The museum has its own free parking lot. The museum is about the history of the Los Angeles Police Department. The admission price ($9) includes an audio tour. There are a variety of police vehicles and tools on exhibit. There are also videos and wall postings of various major events. There are also numerous listings and photographs of the many heroes of the force. A worthwhile way to spend a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
50,Surprised,"We were not expecting this museum to be as good as it was, as it is limited to just police. We were very wrong. It was well done. The displays ranged from early history to present day for the LA police department, They had various vehicles to include armored tanks to helicopters. The museum was educational and informative. We spent about 3 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d0nnagaya
50,"Great museum, fantastic staff!","We misjudged the time and unfortunately showed up well after closing time, so we looked through the windows & were about to leave when a great staff member named Dave stuck his head out to see if he could help. When he ascertained that we'd come all the way from Australia and that we weren't able to return to the area before we went home, he let us come in for '5 minutes' to have a quick look. Well, that 5 minutes became half an hour & we were so fortunate to see the exhibits, and to have Dave explain them to us. He even gave us time to get photos of the kids in a cell and inside the helicopter & some cars, and also to visit the gift shop.There's a large parking lot to the left of the museum, and possibly more parking to the right. A photo under the parking lot sign makes a great shot. Oh, and the building now also has air conditioning.This museum is really interesting, and not just for law enforcement, although it certainly makes you more appreciative of the dangerous and thankless job that they do. If you have children, it's a very interesting place for them to see and to reinforce the importance of policing.The exhibits are very interesting and varied, and there is a lot of equipment, weapons and vehicles to see & even touch/climb. The kids loved the cars, helicopter, bomb equipment, jail cell and interrogation room.Definitely either take the audio tour, or even better, try to get a docent to explain some of the setup to you. The psychology behind the interrogation room was fascinating to hear about.This museum is definitely worth a visit, and if we can get back there we'd probably allow a good 2-3 hours to see it, although you won't have to spend so long there if you chose not to. I don't know how long the audio tour takes, but I'd also like to try it.Whilst there, please support the museum by purchasing items in their gift shop. There are pink police patches available for purchase, in support of breast cancer research for just $10. And with entry only $9, and kids under 12 free, you can afford to splash out on something that supports such a great cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
40,Good Displays,"The best thing about this museum is the displays. There is an old police helicopter, SWAT van, police cruisers, and also the actual vehicles that were involved in the North Hollywood Shootout in 1997. There are authentic uniforms, pistols, prison cells. There is really good information about the Onion Field, SLA, and the North Hollywood Shootout. However, there is a lot left out (e.g. OJ, Rodney King). Overall, a good stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ogau2015
50,Must See,Great museum to visit and not much of a crowd so you can enjoy it. The hours are 10-6 but not open everyday of the week so check the website. The $9 admission fee is well worth it. They have an audio tour or you can just browse on your own. A lot of history relating to big issues that have happened in Los Angeles such as the North Hollywood Shootout. The actual cars are located at the museum and gives a lot of information on the situation. Parking is also free on the property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbmK1
40,"A Museum that ""Backs Badge""","Countless artifacts, a life like booking experience, thorough audio tour and a entire museum that hi lights the history of the LAPD and their commitment to the community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAFFSTOP
40,Informative & interesting,"This is a very slick little museum which has some interesting exhibits & stories to tell. You can have your mug shot taken, take a seat in an old cell & a helicopter and look around lots of old police cars covering several decades and including several specialist SWAT vehicles. At $9 for an adult it's not bank breaking & fills a couple of hours if you listen to all the commentaries on the audio guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahe832
40,Worth the Stop-Pretty Interesting,"I have an interest in law enforcement so this place was on my agenda for my recent trip to LA. The old police building it is housed in is interesting. There were displays on all the major incidents in LA Police History including The Onion Field, North Hollywood Shootout and three room of exhibits on the SLA and Patty Hearst. Outside in the back they have the actual suspect car and a squad car from the North Hollywood Shootout full of bullet holes, along with several other police vehicles. I spent about two hours here but if you don't have as much interest in law enforcement you will probably be here for an hour or so. It was worth the time and drive I made to get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
40,Fascinating Museum,Went today with my partner to look at this wonderful retired police building. The exhibits are fascinating with lots of information and the collection of vehicles and helicopter is enough to make any adult feel like a kid again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423hughj
30,Not bad but needs more,Heavy on actual crime scene photos and items seized from them but not so heavy on background information. The entire time I was there I kept thinking I need to look this up on wiki to get more information e.g. personal relationships amongst Symbionese LIberation Army people for insight into why they did what they did. Wanted to crack cruiser hood to see bullet damage to engine block but not allowed - but no sign saying yes or no about this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cubecritter
50,Lots of LA Police History,This museum gives you lots of history of the LA Police Department. It's located in a former police precinct building. They even have old police vehicles and a helicopter you can sit in. The actual police car and criminals car from the famous Bank of America Shoot Out are on display too. There is a nice display of memorabilia from the actual robbery. Make sure you watch the video of the shootout too. The old jail cells are as they were back in the day. You can go inside them and get a taste of what it's like to be a criminal. Young and old alike will enjoy this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorip849
40,Different kind of visit,"An usual spot we had been meaning to check out for a small while. The ladies working up front were very nice and helpful (suggested we skip one section as the child might be too young). Came here on a Monday morning with a young child (6 years old) - it was empty and it fun as we had the whole place to ourselves. Although we enjoyed most of it (jails, handcuff display, cars, helicopter, etc), some of the attractions still managed to freak out the little one a tad. We still liked it overall - would come back in a few years when he's older to better understand the whole thing and listen to the audio piece. (PS - Ate at Coco's across the street - deli style food -nothing fancy but great service).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Novemberpeanut
40,Get a fisthand view of what policing LA is all about-- past and present,"This is a gem of a museum with surprises around every corner. House in the old Northeast police station, you get the full picture of walking into the station, approaching the front desk and on to the interior. Beautiful hardwood floors and wood accents ( they sure dont make em like this anymore) . Get your picture taken holding your ""booking"" number, tour the jail and ever changing exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013
50,Great place,Great place. It was a little bigger than I was expecting and my boys loved it. They had a great time getting in the helicopter and seeing all of the old vehicles. Adults are $9 and kids under 12 are free!!! Probably one of their favorites after a week in the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwC7103LD
40,"Enjoyed the museum, but may not connect as well for everyone","There's a nice audio tour with the museum which is appreciated and worth working through. I liked the museum but then I was raised on Adam 12 and Emergency, and I know of the SLA shootout, Onion Field, and Northridge shootout which are three featured exhibits. Seeing an actual shop (squad car) from the Northridge shootout full of bullet holes was eerie.If you have an interest in the LAPD, then you'll find the museum interesting as I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
50,Who knew?,"Was told by my son that we had to visit this museum - being a woman I was less than enthusiastic. What a surprise to find it was so very interesting and full of information about the whole history of the LAPD back to the beginning, including displays and photographs/models. And the staff were extremely helpful too. We spent about three hours there and it was well worth it, and only a small price to pay (I think it was $8 each). Highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer803637
40,"Old Police Station, Great Exhibits, Jail Cells and a Real Helicopter!","Located in a former LAPD police precinct, this museum has two floors of exhibits and a rear parking area with several police vehicles and a retired LAPD Bell Jetranger helicopter you can sit in for photo ops.The exhibits include items, photos and weapons from major LAPD investigations including the SLA (remember Patty Hearst?), the onion field murder (made famous by the Joseph Wambaugh book) and an excellent exhibit detailing the North Hollywood Bank shootout which injured multiple officers. Parked in the outside lot are three vehicles from this incident with bullet holes. As the building was once a working police station, visitors can explore the front desk, and jail cells which once held suspects.Other exhibits show the evolution of handcuff technology, uniforms worn over the years by the department, badges, the role of reserve officers.The museum appears to be a work in progress (rooms closed with other items in storage) with possible additional exhibits forthcoming so it will be interesting to see what is added in the future. I admire the effort, apparently by volunteers, that has gone into this museum, as the LAPD is one of the largest police forces with a long history which needs to be shared. Couple that with the department frequently being featured in the TV and movie industry and this attraction needs to be on your must see list.I would estimate that 3 hours would be ample time to see most everything (but I am the type of person who likes to see and read each exhibit). Make sure not to miss Jack Webb's checked sport coat from the Dragnet TV series hanging framed on a wall on the first floor.With the admission fee (9$ adults, under 12 free) you are provided with a audio guided tour which provides a lot of the details.There is ample free parking off street for visitors, it is on a bus line, but some distance from Metro rail. There is a small gift shop with challenge coins, t-shirts and other LAPD merchandise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/206driver
50,"If Police History is your interest, you will like this",I spent almost an hour at the museum and it captivated me from start to finish. I liked all the police vehicles and the various exhibits on the 3rd floor. In particular the exhibit on the 1997 North Hollywood shootout highlights how dangerous policing is and the bravery exhibited by the LAPD in bringing down two heavily armed bank robbers. Another point of interest is that the museum was formally an old police station converted to a museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
40,"""Worth seeing""","The ‚ÄúHighland Park Police Station‚Äù in the Highland Park section of Los Angeles, is the city's oldest surviving police station and was closed in 1983.The station took a year to construct (1925-1926), and cost $100,000 to build at that time. The new police station opened in April 1926, and the official opening was attended by then Chief, Edgar Davis and Police Commissioners, Birnbaum, Insley and Webster.** ‚ÄúDid you know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,‚Äù that in 1942, future LAPD Chief Daryl Gates was arrested and briefly held at this station for ‚Äúassault and battery on an officer!‚Äù In 1963, he returned as a police captain in command of the station.A number of ‚Äúhigh profile‚Äù cases were handled out of this station; ""Hillside Stranglers"", Angelo Buono, Jr. and the Kenneth Bianchi case. The radical Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), the group that kidnapped Patty Hearst and engaged in an infamous shootout with the LAPD in 1974. In 1973, they planted a bomb at this station but it proved to be a ‚Äúdud.‚ÄùIn the early 1980s, the building was cited for being unsafe and failed to meet seismic safety standards and closed in 1983. The vacant building was set for demolition until the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission declared it a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #274) in January 1984. Two months later (Mar 84), the building was added to the National Register of Historic Buildings. The station is now operated as the ‚ÄúLos Angeles Police Museum.‚ÄùThis museum is a self-guided tour and on display is the ‚Äúholding cells‚Äù along with the way a police stationed looked like for that time period. The museum also includes photographs, uniforms, badges, squad cars, a paddy wagon, and bullet-riddled vehicles for the ‚ÄúInfamous North Hollywood Bank Robbery Shootout.‚ÄùFebruary 28, 1997, ‚ÄúNorth Hollywood Shootout‚Äù two heavily armed bank robbers (Larry Phillips Jr and Emil MƒÉtƒÉsƒÉreanu), against a couple hundred LAPD Officers! Eleven police officers and seven civilians were injured, and both robbers were killed. There were numerous vehicles and private property damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by both sides.‚Ä¢ Due to the large number of injuries, rounds fired, weapons used, and overall lengthy shootout, it is regarded as one of the longest and bloodiest events in US police history.The museum is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the third Saturday of each month from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.Our visit;I think I was just as enthusiastic as my kids were in coming to visit this place. From the outside, there really wasn‚Äôt anything ‚Äúsnazzy‚Äù about the place. There wasn‚Äôt any advertisement or some ‚Äúclown holding an arrow, like you see around tax time.‚Äù We were able to park next to the museum which was convenient. You could tell this place was old by just looking at how it was built and once you entered, it undeniably had that ‚Äúturn of the century‚Äù style.The museum has two floors of old uniforms, weapons, and accessories worn by officers of that bygone era. The one incident that most stands out in my mind is the ‚ÄúNorth Hollywood Shootout.‚Äù I remember watching this live on TV and was glued as I watched the firefight taking place between the ""two bank robbers and almost all of LAPD!""It was hard to watch as civilians and officers went down and with live coverage, you saw the blood all over the place. The ending was the most dramatic as ‚ÄúSWAT officers‚Äù exchanged fire with the lone gunman and eventually took him into custody. The suspect died shortly thereafter on scene. I still have vivid memories of the whole incident!The museum had on display and encased in glass, the life size manikins of the two heavily armed robbers and a video tape of the actual shootout. Vehicles outside of the museum included a shot-up police vehicle, armored vehicle, and a helicopter, used during this incident.I recalled this incident changed the way police officers responded to future shootouts. Before, regular patrol officers only had their sidearm and shotgun at their disposal and had to wait for SWAT to arrive for the firepower. Today, officers are equipped with the latest AR-15‚Äôs to match the suspect‚Äôs firepower.My family enjoyed all the props and items at this museum and upstairs, sat and watched the actual North Hollywood Shootout. While they watched the documentary, I enjoyed reading and looking at all the uniforms and other things they had displayed.On the humorous side, the museum also displayed ‚ÄúID Cards‚Äù from the widely popular 60‚Äôs Detective TV Series, ‚ÄúDragnet‚Äù which featured a ‚Äútrue‚Äù story every week. Det. Joe Friday & Gannon's police identifications they ‚Äúflashed‚Äù on the show was on display (Uploaded to YELP).Can‚Äôt say enough how much I enjoyed seeing this museum and I think the kids liked it too! Our family left learning a lot more about police work along with memories of this trip here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdtheair
40,An interesting museum especially law enforcement officers,"We visited the museum while on a road trip of the southwest and west coast. My wife and I are both retired police officers, and have visited a few other police museums over the years. The museum is located in an old police station. Many of the displays are photographs, but there were nice displays of uniforms and equipment, including weapons. There were 3 main exhibits; Patty Hearst, The Onion Field police officer murder, and the North Hollywood bank shootout.A lot behind the museum held old police vehicles and a helicopter. There were also a few cars from the bank shootout. The only criticism I have is that the labeling on the exhibits could be better, as many were typewritten cards or yellowing pieces of paper. These could be updated very nice with today,s computers and printers.We visited on a very hot day, and the museum has no AC, so it was really hot, especially on the upper floors. Overall though a very nice museum, with a lot of potential.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HunkyJoe
30,not bad,"I only spent like an hour there. It's not bad. The most impressive thing is that they have like 10 vehicles and one helicopter, which were all actually used by LAPD, parking in the back yard. Anyway, if you are interested in police stuff, it's way to go to visit there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/574_2013
30,"Better than expected, worth as visit","We've been to L.A. many times and were looking for something different to visit. Saw this museum on trip advisor and decided to try it. It was easy to find and there was free parking right next door. They had photos and exhibits tracing the history of the L.A. police department. Displays of uniforms,badges,guns,etc form different eras. Also, outside several old vehicles and even aircraft. A police car riddled with bullets from the infamous shootout with the bank robbers that was on live T.V. several years ago. Since this was an actual polkice station, there are actual cells. There are major exhibits for the SLA shootouts ( Patty Hearst), the Onion filed,and the Big bank robbery and shootout.This is worthwhile to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nabman11
30,they must love patti hearst and joe wambaugh,"all i can say is dont do it without a docent. it will make the time well worth the brief visit. lots of space to old l.a. p.d. and major crimes like sla, onion field and the b of a robbery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sw642
