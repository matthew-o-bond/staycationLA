40,Fascinating and Somber,"Surrounded by busy noisy freeways this is something that’s easy to miss. I happened to go by and decided to check it out in a very respectful way. From the statues at the very front entrance to all of the graves and other remarkable landmarks inside the grounds, this is a very sobering and touching experience. Probably not for everyone but after seeing the cemeteries in Normandie and Flanders last summer, I found this resting place, too, earns a well respected recommendation for those who appreciate the sacrifices made and wish to explore a bit of the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanW440
50,Dedication of the Columbarium at the Los Angeles National Cemetery,"I attended the Dedication of the new Columbarium at the Los Angeles National Cemetery. First, the Guest Speakers were all very good and thankfully brief. Second, the entire Columbarium and grounds are beautiful. And finally, Gary Sinise provided a moving and impassioned speech. I was fortunate to actually meet him. He’s genuine American treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873

50,A Memorial Day Event to remember.,"Yesterday (Saturday), thousands of scouts and their families placed American Flags at every grave site.This morning, I participated in a wonderful tribute to honor the military women and men who gave their last full measure of devotion for this country. Following a brief ceremony, hundreds of attendees spread out to every corner of the Cemetery, where they placed one red and one white carnation at every grave site. It was a very moving experience and I think I wlll do it again next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,So Glad I Visited,"I really enjoyed my visit! I went from top to bottom of the cemetery. I visited Wyatt Earps Dad`s grave. Being a Dog Lover I visited the only two Dogs buried in the cemetery, Bonus and Blackout. There are so many Vet`s from the Vietnam War. It's one thing to say over a hundred thousand Americans died in that war. But to see thousands of graves is a Moving Experience. The Cemetery is one of the most Peaceful Places I have ever been to. The Grounds are kept perfect. Green Grass and every head stone neatly trimmed. Magnificent Trees, I'm sure most are over one hundred years old. It's free parking and free to get in. I only had three hours there. I would Love to spend a day there. I`m so proud of our Country for Honoring our Vets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billtT2886RA
50,Very Impressive,I was visiting family at the VA facility and took a break to see a little of the area and walk some. This Cemetery is very impressive and well worth the visit. It is very moving to know that each marker represents a deceased service member and in many cases the spouse is also interred in the same grave. This is a good place for a break from the crowd and traffic that surrounds it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillY791
50,Freedom isnt Free,"When you think about your freedom, it is hard to forget that many made the ultimate sacrifice. This place is a remembrance that freedom isn't always free. We recently attended a day when wreaths are placed on the markers of those fallen men and women that aren't with us (Dec 16th). This is a great learning tool for our younger children to remind them not to take freedom for granite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch
40,Arlington Cemetery of the West,"I saw a statue at the corner of the street and saw the name and think of it as a regular and normal cemetery with lots of green space. Then I walk down and was so moved when I saw rows and rows of head stones arrange with great view and sections like at the Arlington Cemetery. Great discover by me. The National Cemetery is located in Westwood and not far from Westwood Village and UCLA campus. If you are in the area, stop by to see and appreciate those who sacrificed for us and for the country. Plenty of parking on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
40,Very iconic and moving,Classic veterans cemetery with lines of white marble headstones. Very moving and respectful. It's not a tourist attraction but you are free to visit and pay respects to war veterans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcp1002017
50,Very Somber Reminder of Sacrifice,"Didn't realize the LA National Cemetery was in Westwood, CA until I drove by and saw it for myself. Parked and walked through the gravesites -- very moving, and reminiscent of Arlington National Cemetery, which I visit annually. A beautifully maintained tribute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshapiro99
40,Somber remembrance of our fallen soldiers,"The first thing you see is a beautiful statue on the corner. As you go further you realize that what you are seeing is a National Cemetery. Pull in and park your car. Step out. And just look. And then it hits you, all those headstones are the resting places of all the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.You will need your car to go through the cemetery as it is quite large, but make sure you stop at the Bob Hope Chapel. I love that they named the chapel in his honor, as he loved America and put on shows in the USO during too many wars.You will notice the Civil War soldier statue, standing ever vigilant over those in their final rest.As you drive further into the cemetery, you will see the columbarium, so be sure to stop in. There are uniforms behind glass so that you may see the uniforms worn by the brave men and women of the military. This building was created in the Spanish revival style.Drive further up and you will see an obelisk and a cannon a little further up.My stop at the cemetery was done on a spur of the moment on my way home from a very long day. However, I did find out that there are 5 Civil War Medal of Honor recipients buried here. I like to do a lot of research on places I visit, but since I stopped on a spur of the moment it was only after my visit was I able to do research. The history of this cemetery is very interesting, so I would suggest, if you choose to go, do a little research and find out who is buried here.Wear good walking shoes, take your time. Who knows what you will find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottesl

50,My Memorial Day Visit,"Even though I've lived in Los Angeles all my life, I decided to visit the Los Angeles National Cemetery on Memorial Day for the first time. It has been there since 1889 and has been closed to new internments since 2002. Fourteen Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients are interred there, as well as over 100 Buffalo Soldiers and African American soldiers from the 9th, 10th, 24th, and 25th Cavalry (American Civil War). Two War Dogs (""Bonus"" buried with handler, Charles E. Temple, Ensign, USNR, and ""Blackout"" buried with handler, George Lewis Oshier, US Navy Cook) also reside there. It is beautifully maintained by Dept. of Veterans Affairs. Don't forget to visit the Bob Hope Veterans Chapel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
