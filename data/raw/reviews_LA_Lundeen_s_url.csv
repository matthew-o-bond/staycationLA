50,An unexpected gem,"Visiting from out of town, we dropped into this place just to get a birthday card for my son; we left a half hour later with multiple items to give in the future. My rule is that if I open a greeting card and I laugh out loud, I just buy it and I brought home four of them. They have a nice assortment of mugs, books, candles, and many other interesting things. And they will wrap up to ""Three for Free.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newton72
