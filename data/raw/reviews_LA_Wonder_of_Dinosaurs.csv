50,Wonderful,Terrific place to take you down children to work off their excess energy. Lots of bounce areas providing great enjoyment for our young grandchildren. Seems like a safe controlled play area but parents and grandparents must keep alert because the kids will quickly run between the various play areas in a very large space. Wish they would offer a yearly pass because the kids had a wonderful time.,alanmalman
