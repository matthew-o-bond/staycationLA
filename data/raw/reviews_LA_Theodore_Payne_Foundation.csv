50,California Native Plants,"My husband is determined to have a garden full of colorful, drought-resistant California native plants. He decided that we really had to go to the Theodore Payne Foundation, which has a nursery of plants. Since I was aware of the Foundation, I was eager to go, too. We enjoyed going through the specially marked areas (e.g., trees), and selecting plants. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We ended up becoming members and leaving with a trunk full of fragrant plants plus several packets of seeds.",tapbelle

30,You have to be a California native plant diehard to appreciate this place,"This is a combination california native plant nursery combined with a few trails that are at the base of property. It is not the easiest to find but close to the main thoroughfare. Parking is tight if the nursery is full. Unless you are looking for a specific type of california native plant for purchase, there are other nature/trail options that I think are better suited.",chicago90Phoenix
