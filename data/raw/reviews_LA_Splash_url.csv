50,Great time,"Spent a great day with granddaughters, we hang out at the lazy river, they went up to the slides more times than I can count on. We really loved it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elsuca1961
50,very family friendly and they provide life jackets,Very family friendly grandkids loved the lazy river also loved playing in shallow pool. staff very friendly put up umbrella and sun came out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryhY9941DN
50,Cool down place,Great place to spend a few hours to beat the heat in the summer. Not overwhelming like other water parks. Could spend all day in the lazy river.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilirexmama
40,great for entertaining kids on a hot day!,"We had two children (ages 6 and 4) with us and they had a blast in the areas most suited for younger children. Our grandchildren were well entertained for almost three hours without tiring. We did not use the play facilities more suited for older, bigger kids. Limited but adequate food and refreshment available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/192juann
40,Family Outing,Great for familiea without the crowds of traditional water parks. Enough to keep family happy. Plus they offer swim classes and my 4 year old loves his class.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896emiliom

30,Swim lessons,"I've been taking my daughter here for private swim lessons since she was 6 months old. (may 2016). That year was amazing they weren't very busy I was alway able to get into the morning classes without an issue and but now I feel like am always struggling to get her into a class, they've gotten a lot busier and since they are private classes there aren't very many so they fill up fast.I wish they would let the returning student's that live in the city of La Mirada register first, it would be nice.This year we've had a few issues with Splash and when it comes to the swim lessons... They've become very unorganized, my daughter had two different instructors at one point.They also do a lot of their cleaning in the mornings so when they are using their blowers you get all fumes while your sitting there, which is annoying.The only reason why we continue to go is because of Andrew G (teaches the morning classes) is absolutely wonderful and my 21 month loves him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332evieb
50,Hidden gem!,"The splash is great and so much cleaner than Soak CIty or Raging Waters. It's small, which I like. I love that they offer adult lap swim as well. Price is a bit steep, but I'd rather take my family here where it's less crowded, than to a larger water park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianea28
40,Busy Place but Fun,"If you don't mind the somewhat crowded water features than for the money, you'll be just fine. The kids will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolwU9291FA
30,Crowded,"This place is in a small neighborhood, but open to the public. It gets very crowded. When my kids were smaller, the kiddy splash pad and pool were nice. But now that they're older, the ""lazy river"" is a nightmare. They let kids in with or without a float, so you have kids swimming around your legs, kicking water in your face. The last time we were I. There, a large woman pushed my 6-yr old daughter into the wall, TWICE. Then there is the food...you can't take your own food and the food they have to purchase is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KnTnEnN
50,Great Time!,"Went with hubby, youngest son, his fiancee and our grandson (from our daughter) who is 4 years old. Hubby and I sat under an umbrella and watched as grandson was taken through the whole attraction by his uncle and aunt to be. They have life preservers for everyone to use (free). Two specific areas insure that even the little kids can participate. That pool is much more shallow, but plenty deep enough for adults too. They offer a lazy river ride where you go through in inner tube type flotation devices. Water slides as well as big buckets that dump water on you are readily available. If you just want to lap swim there is an entirely separate area for that, and adults can also avail themselves of a large, in-ground spa that is gated off to keep kids out. Locker rooms are available and beautiful. Seating around the waterpark portion of the facility is plentiful with umbrella tables. Limited food and beverages are offered for purchase. Lifeguards are plentiful and do a very good job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mewsicmama
50,local fun,this place is sort of hidden. which is great! but I think everyone knows about it now. good place to cool off,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368jasmineh
40,Small but wonderful water park.,"Older kids may not be impressed because there are only 3 large slides, but our 8, 6, and 4 years olds could not get enough! They especially enjoyed the lazy river! For the price it can't be beat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianntiffanym
40,My husband took my kids there and they kept going back!,They love it. They want to go back so it must be good.Price is right. You can buy the tickets online at a discount so buy it online.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francesychen
50,Low price Waterpark,"This is a win win if you have small children. Free parking, food,three waterslides for up older children. Great prices and a lazy river for relaxing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenk793
50,Great for kids of all ages,"This is best for locals, especially if you get the early-bird season pass at $54/person. Kids under 3 are free (their website says kids 2 and under are free). Individual passes are $15 for kids under 48"" and $20 for kids/adults over 48"".Perks: free use of life jackets and tubes for the lazy river.Downside: no outside food (they do a bag check before you can enter).There are 3 areas:Splash pad: great for toddlers 12 months - 2 yearsShallow water/mini slides: great for kids ages 2-5Big kid slide: there are 3 sides. A steep one, an open swirl, and a closed swirl. The open swirl line (yellow) is the longest and on a busy day can take 10-15 min to get through. The steep slide (blue) rarely has a line, and the closed swirl (green) is usually 5 min.The lazy river is awesome for all ages.We have season passes and love coming here for an hour or 2. It's great because I don't feel like I need to get my money's worth in a day and we're bake to enjoy a few laps on the lazy river, a few times down the kiddie slide (they let parents hold babies on the slide if they're under 36""), and some time at the splash pad. It's perfect to visit before lunch/naptime and my little one naps so well after we visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AC5736
50,Local fun!,"Splash! Is a family friendly aquatic facility with Buccaneer Bay water park as it's central attraction. It is fun for kids of all ages. In addition there are swimming lessons available and am Olympic pool with organizations providing top level Olympic caliber coaching and e ability to compete in water sports (swimming, water polo, and synchronized swimming).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenbU3806CE

50,Very nice,"A great facility with something for everyone. Olympic size pool with seating. Nice water park for the little ones. Large, SHALLOW pool. Great for the kids that have trouble swimming. A lot of staff on hand to keep a look out. These lifeguards had their hands full when we were there :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apennywise
40,"Convenient, local waterpark","Nice city waterpark with 3 slides, lazy river, toddler area, lap pools. Lush clean grounds with plenty of tables/lounges and grassy areas. Great music. Not clearly marked from street so hard to find entrance. Water in Buccaneer Bay was pretty cold. Food was good but took way too long and was a little pricey. If you eat before you go, it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U240SBlisac
50,Not Bad!,"This is a great, small waterpark and just right for the money. It does get crowded and seats, especially in the shade, are scarce, so get there early. Otherwise, my 14 year old had a blast going down the slides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54JenniferG
40,Great way to cool off with the kids!,"This is a small water park that is big on Fun! When it's not too crowded, it is the perfect place to take the family on a hot day. They do a great job of watching out for the safety of the guests. The lazy river feature is very cool! The price is very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golaryn
50,Wow! Great pool facility.,"The on deck amities are great. This public facility even has a in-ground spa. Wow! However, the women's locker room is not user friendly as there is limited seating or places to place items. The lockers are complicated to use. Private changing areas do not have benches to place items. Great place for a swim meet or to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaraTheExplorer
40,This place is fun!,I love this water park. It's small enough to keep an eye on your children and affordable. We usually buy passes for the summer. You don't wait in line long with passes. They have lockers for $5.00 with wristbands. There's no food allowed in but they have a small concession stand. Parking is free! I wouldn't bring kids that are over 10 years old. But its great for kids 10 and younger.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keez955
40,A great water park for kids.,"We have young kids and this is a perfect water park for them. A play area for the little kids, a lazy river for everyone, and 3 big slides for kids 48 inches and up. Our kids are 8,8, and 11. They have a great time on the slides, river, and play area. The snack shop has good food and prices are ok, or you can picnic outside on the grass. You can bring bottled water in. There is free parking, and free life jackets for the little kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattm329
40,A great place to get wet,"I cannot add much to what is already written.-The pool is large and clean.- Buccaneer Bay is great fun for thekids and for their parents.- The staff is friendly, efficient, andabove all safety minded.I do have one suggestion: There is a lap timer and only a lap timer for the entire complex. It would be ever so helpful to place two clocks, one in the pool area and the other in Buccaneer Bay. An outdoor clock costs very little to buy. Clocks can be had a Lowe's and Home Depot for around $25.00, battery operated so no wiring. It would be nice to know the time, especially when trying to organize as to going home times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byronh891
50,Great place for kids to have fun,"Visited Splash with my family and they had a blast. Its a small park but great for keeping an eye on your kids, they have a lazy river, 3 slides, 2 pools with all sorts of atractions. They sell food at a desent price and have life guards literally in every corner. I upgraded to their season pass. Worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luisr790
40,"Great for small children, less hectic than the average water park","This definitely isn't a full-scale water park. There are 3 decent slides and 2 baby ones, a lazy river, a big bucket and a spray area. However, it's not all the walking of a big park either. Chairs around the kiddie pool can definitely be a problem, even during the week when large groups of local moms save 10-20 chairs for their group together. However, if you're only using a chair for a longer rest, there are tables farther out and lots of nice grass.The lazy river is one of my favorites anywhere. Not too long, fast enough to help keep everyone moving and afloat and with a few cute water features. There is a great play area with slides and separate spray area for the littles.The bathrooms are decent considering the sheer wet traffic they get and the one time we ate there it was very good. A great value for the price without all the spread out chaos of a bigger park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summerw
40,Easy family fun,"Took the kids here because we had nothing else planned and they needed to get out of the house. Arriving around noon on an overcast Saturday did not guarantee seating. Almost all of the chaise lounge chairs were taken. While we were walking around looking for a place to drop off our personal items, it started to drizzle/sprinkle/rain. I quickly chose a nearby umbrella and told the kids they could take off and explore. They spent a lot of time in the lazy river floating around. There are plenty of lifeguards on duty, and they are on the kids to make sure everyone is safe. The only mishap we had all day was my son got pushed against the wall of the lazy river by a crowd of older kids and ended up with a big scratch on his back. Otherwise, they enjoyed the 3 slides and had a good time playing soccer on the lawn with some random kids.When you walk in, you'll notice the high level of chlorine in the area. With that many people in the water, I guess you can understand why. Just make the kids rinse off in the showers before you head home for a real shower and things should be okay. This by no means is a huge water park like Raging Rivers or Knott's, but it's nice an convenient for local families who want something convenient to do during the summer months. We got a season pass that included free tickets for more guests, lots of coupons, and some local discounts.We had lunch here, too. Burgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken, grilled salmon, salads are some options...along with some fried items. The kids really enjoyed the burgers, which are grilled to order and come with a condiment bar of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, etc. I had a hot dog that tasted a lot like a Hebrew National. The grilled items take a bit of time...the guys at the grill don't have their stuff together at times. Kids' meals come with chips and fruit...they upcharge for fries. The fries are crinkle cut and are not crispy enough.What's most important is that the kids had a good time, and it was a nice way for us to spend the afternoon together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tovant
40,Fun Water Park - Great for Little Kids,"This water park is great for families with young kids. Teenagers will enjoy it for about an hour, and then be bored, but the little kids have lots to do with slides and lots of fountains. Parents can lounge at the edge of the large play structure and watch their kids get wet and play on the slides. The life guards are all very conscious of the little kids and work hard to keep the bigger kids from knocking the little ones around.Also, during the off season, the facility has great swim lessons in their heated pools.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickd224
50,Last minute splash!,Our family decided to try out the Splash location as a last minute option for some family fun. When we arrived the parking lot was full and we escorted to their shuttle bus location down the street. After that obstacle we make it to the water park and splash around. The outside grilled food was perfection. We ordered burgers along with fries. Our family thought their wristband locker system was cool. The park had a lil bit for everyone and besides our family having a long day we had a great time at Splash!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liveinthemomentnow
50,Great for babies and toddler's,"This place is great for younger kids, babies, and toddler's. I saw someone complain about the excess of safety concerns and use of life jackets for anyone under 48 inches but, I rather have an abundance of life guards rather than too few like the other parks on the area. Yes, its true you cannot bring in your own food, but its a short walk to your cooler in the car. They do allow one small snack for toddlers and water bottles are allowed. My husband, my little one and myself had a really great time and became season pass holder's. If you purchase your pass before the end of May, you receive a $20 discount. They also have monthly payment options, $18 for three months with a few freebies and special events thrown in. Happy summer everyone!! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/882faridg
30,Much Quieter than the Big Ones,Splash is a bit more of a hometown waterpark than the big boys with massive water slides and massive crowds.I haven't been in a couple years and I heard about great future plans for the park and programs.One of the things I didn't like was the lack of a non-swimmer fee. If you entered you paid full adult price no matter what. My son had a season pass and he would have liked to go there many times but each time I would have to buy a pass to sit and watch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bsaw
40,"Family Fun, Clean","I like that Splash is pretty new and clean, it's fun for your average water park, and free parking is great.My only complaint is the lazy river, if your a mom wearing sunglasses (I know many of us do lol) you can not relax in the lazy river at the end where the buckets drop buckets of water you will most likely lose them pouring water on you. So I always felt I could not relax there. I like Soak City's Lazy River better, I can just relax and float and not lose my sunglasses. It's too bad they can't adjust that to have an option to one way or another.Anyways there are 3 water slides that the kids like and a baby toddler / kid splash zone area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzieQ38
50,Small but fun waterpark,"This place is very local and inexpensive. Only $18 for over 48' inches. There is an Olympic pool, lazy river, 2 kid play areas & some slides. FYI: no outdoor food only water bottles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anniefran83
40,Awesome water park for kids & adults of all ages!,"This place is in a perfect location for me & my family. Not too far like other water parks & it has a little of everything from toddler pools to huge water slides & most of all the lazy river is suitable for everyone. The showers, restrooms & changing rooms are well maintained. You get a good deal if you buy your passes ahead of time and not to mention the coupons you get per pass, usually discounts on food and free sandwich from Chick-Fil-A, plus free friend admittance to Splash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Solis4
20,Family Camp Out,"I am a season pass holder along with my daughter. First the good stuff. It is is closer to me and they have so many lifeguards you feel safe taking a restroom break without your over 48"" 9 year old leaving the lazy river to go along with you. Don't become complacent people it your kid needs a life jacket do not let go! It is not crowded but the people in tubes are there to have a good time not look out for your sputtering, floundering child clinging to the wall of the slow moving river for dear life. The 3 slides are perfect for average thrill seekers and the lines are short. Perfect time to go is on a Friday when they are open till 8 p.m. Go after 2 p.m., that is usually when the summer day campers have left. Now, the family camp out August 9th. Logistically good of been set up better. Not sure why they did not have the s'mores cook out set up closer to the tent sites. Not sure why they did not offer carts to schlep your gear to your site. I did get help from a staff member to carry my gear after I asked for help. The staff really did not promote the ""games"" they advertised on their posters/flyers. On the way to get s'mores I saw the hula hoops, sidewalk chalk and random bean bags strewn about but no staff or directed play or games. They really need to tell people that the sites are measured out for a 4 to 6 person tent. Any bigger than that and your are in your neighbors site. The showers need to be cleaned out after the park closes so that the people that paid extra to spend the night don't have to clean up after the crowds that have been there all day, just so they can use the shower. Pretty gross, hair in the drain, left over bottles of and zip lock containers of shampoo and other products, towels and wash rags. My biggest complaint is that none of the shower curtains were hung correctly on the hooks. They were either missing hooks or unhooked or broken. So privacy was limited. The meal provided is the same stuff you can get from their snack bar. Burgers, hot dogs, pizza, chips and a soda. Breakfast was a choice of small boxed cereals mini packaged donuts, muffins from Coscto cut into fours, croissants, milk, oj, apples, bananas, string cheese, go-gurt, danimals yogurt drink, and coffee. I spend $28.00 each for my daughter and I for this (that was the season pass holder rate) Still not sure if I will go to the camp out next year",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlo642
10,Annoying safety focus,"Let's start with the good: free parking, no lines to get in and much cheaper than 6flags.But our visit was a MAJOR disappointment. For others, you should be helped knowing the following:The dressing rooms had lockers, but nobody told us we would have to get a special locker armband ($5 once) to use them. Seems like rarely any guests shower before entering pools, showers are mostly not used.The worst point though is the EXTREME focus on safety. I have been to quite a lot of water parks all over the world, and I have NEVER seen anything like this. There are lifeguards EVERYWHERE. In the river about every 10 feet (the water is 3-4 feet deep..), there is two serving the ""big slides"" where only one person is allowed at a time (for your safety), and yes they also have a lifeguard at the end of the small kids slide to make sure they exit safely. That slide is 3 feet tall. Water is perhaps 5 inches deep. Plus they insist that EVERY child under 46"" height is not allowed on ""big slides"" and MUST wear a swim west. No matter how closely guarded by a parent, no exception. They claim it is ocean rules...And the 50m swim bath we also came for (so that one adult could do laps) ? ""Closed, because we do not have any lifeguards. "". The smaller swim area ? ""Closed until 1230, because of education of swimmers"".Yes, we paid 70 USD to wade around 5-10 inch deep baby pools guarded by at least 15 life guards. Our 5 year old wearing a life vest. She probably could not even have drowned if she tried to.The irony of all this annoying safety focus: in a splash area, where they finally let little kids free of the life wests, a mat at the bottom of a slide was loose from the screws that fixed it to the concrete. Result: kids would scrape the legs landing on concrete. Response after telling 3 staff members ""yes we know, it will be fixed during next week"". Would they tell the same if a sharp object was tearing your foot somewhere ""yeah we know, but you do not drown.""I gave up explaining to these safety robots the irony of it all. Feared they would follow the 5-year old to the toilet fearing she would drown in American toilets.. the water there is deeper than the pool where she had to wear life vest.We did not buy any of their unhealthy and expensive junk food. Chicken nuggets, fries and soda, is that the best food you can come up with ?All in all, the park is probably good if you have someone max 2 years old. For any other age groups this park is nothing but restrictions ""for your safety"".Whatever happened to responsibility for own actions ?Deeply disappointed. Family of 4 from Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inkjetmand
40,children enjoyed,We took the kids and they enjoyed the different water activities. food queues were quite long and food costly yet they do not allow youto bring in a snack or something...should improve on that...also activities that the kids wanted to do were frequently closed and lifeguards would not allow most ordinary activities in water....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wema34
30,Summer,This is great local place for younger kids. If your kids are 11 or older it is a bit small. The older kids will get bored quick. I would suggest like Knotts water park for them. This is a great small place for young kids and babies for sure! Clean clean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv-2-travel-36DD
