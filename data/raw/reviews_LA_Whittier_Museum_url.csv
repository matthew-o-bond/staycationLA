50,Great slice of History!,"This is a small museum, but packed with the history of Whittier and California as well. A great way to introduce history to a youngster who can't handle a big museum yet. They have some great western history artifacts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,Lots to learn without taking your whole day,"This is a great place to learn about the history of Whittier. They have different displays that are fun to look at, but won't take up your whole day (unless you want it to). The location is fairly close to uptown so you are in close proximity to grabbing a bite to eat. They have many special events here such as Santa visiting, high tea, fashion shows, book signings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stntplr
40,Interesting History,Whittier is an old little city settled by Quakers when you could see all the way downtown on a clear day.The nice historic uptown area still has many original homes and the museum displays artifacts and information about it's early history. It'a fun for school children and adults. I always enjoy learning a bit more and docents have good information to share.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275dianei
50,A few hours of family fun,"I saw a post on social media advertising an event they were hosting on the 30th anniversary of the Whittier earthquake. Since it had been a while since my last visit I decided to stop in and check it out. I brought my daughter with me as well so she could get and idea of what happened to Whittier 30 years ago. We arrived and were able to park in an overflow lot directly across the street since the museum parking was full. In front of the museum they had an earthquake simulator which my daughter was able to experience. The museum was open, but the main event was on the top floor. The exhibit was much larger and more detailed than what I anticipated. They had a film screening of a documentary on the quake in a small theater/filming room, pictures and displays around the room showing the extent of the damage to Whittier from the quake. I was really impressed by how well this event was thought out and presented. My daughter was also able to take part in a CPR demonstration by the Red Cross. After the event we wandered downstairs and checked out the main part of the museum. The museum itself is laid out very well. There were quite a few things about the history of Whittier that I was unaware of, my daughter was also able to see how things were 100+ years ago vs how things are. She especially enjoyed the trolly and school room. If you’re looking to do something different and want to pull your kids away from electronics for a few hours, I definitely recommend checking out the Whittier Museum, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised like I was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hyelala

It is a small museum, but it does have plenty of artifacts and provides good information on the city's history. We were there for about an hour and a half. I would have wanted to stay longer. We could have used a half hour more.We chose to do a self guided tour. But next time that my husband joins us, I will ask for a guided tour. There is no entrance fee, but you can leave a donation.
