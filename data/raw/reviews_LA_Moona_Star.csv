50,"A magical, serene, one-of-a-kind shopping experience","Moon Star Collective sells a beautiful, soft, flowing collection of women-created clothing, handicrafts, art and many other special and unique gifts. The setting alone is worth a visit and a browse. The big and roomy dressing room with ceiling to floor mirror is an affirming, comfortable space for trying on the beautiful clothes, most of which are made to sell only here. The collective benefits the woman who have designed and created the clothes, art and handicrafts. You are sure to meet at least one member of the collective, as I did, when visiting. They are lovely people making beautiful things and selling them in a nature-inspired, lovely environment.",Naomi1
