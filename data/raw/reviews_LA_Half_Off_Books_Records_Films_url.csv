10,It's not there!,"I talked to some people on the street who told me this store moved some time ago. Imagine how I felt driving all the way there to find absolutely nothing. Guess they could have put that information here, eh?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenmeegan69

50,Great local bookstore!!!,"I love Half off Books starting with the name!!! They have new and slightly used books, but they also have collectable books and they can order any books that you don't find. I love walking in there with their hardwood floors and their very welcoming atmosphere. They also have fire sales where many books are only one dollar!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998judithr
50,Fantastic used bookstore on beautiful Greenleaf Avenue,"This is a wonderful used bookstore that book lovers can spend as much time as they need browsing around. For those already visiting Greenleaf Avenue, walking through Half Off after (or before) lunch or dinner makes for nice time. Inviting atmosphere and helpful staff. As their name implies, there are more than books here. Check their website for open mic events. A great complement to Greenleaf Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keystone_Traveler
