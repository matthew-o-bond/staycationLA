50,not a bad place to walk or hike,"nice parts. lotta trash though, not sure why it has no trash cans. good walk or hike. note of caution, there are no benches to sit so take a towel or something and wear sturdy shoes. otherwise fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alusn2020
40,Beautiful historic LA park (regardless of missing swing),"Beautiful park. Definitely not over crowded. Was nice to drive through and view the city from all sides. Beautiful palm trees and overall quite peaceful.Sadly, our joy over finding the trail to the tree swing was short lived as we realized that the swing is .... GONE! : (Not sure if it was removed by park services for safety reasons, or if some nasty human decided to ruin everyone else's fun. Either way, the swing is gone. Still a very nice park - in fact, it's a historical place - the oldest park in LA. Definitely worthy of a picnic in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
40,Nice urban park near Dodger Stadium,We visited this park while we visited Dodger Stadium. We found the trail that took us up to a vista where there is a tree swing. You can view the mountains as well as the Hollywood sign from there. There are other vistas with a view of downtown LA as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875jl
30,A Good Urban Park,"This is a very urban park with many good features including: beautiful picnic area, a good 2.5 mile loop trail from Academy Road with many spring wildflowers, ball fields, tennis courts and open lawns all within a stone’s throw of Dodger’s Stadium. This is LA’s oldest park and although it is a little worn around the edges, it is a welcome respite from the urban sprawl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathb5
30,Meh... underwhelming,"I’ve only been one time but didn’t really experience any beautiful views or particularly special nature. There are many trails and maybe I missed some of the good ones otherwise, I’m not impressed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxS236
50,An Expensive but Fun Ball Park,"This was our first time at the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Coming from Cheyenne, Wyoming it was a very fun but expensive outing. We'd always wanted to go there for a Baseball game and finally made the effort. The Dodgers pounded the Rockies but that did not dampen our experience. We bought 2 lower level seats and the face value was over $200 for both. Food and parking was another $50.... oh well, that's why you work extra so that you can have a nice vacation. My wife is from Los Angeles originally and we'd love to do it again when we can. Great Ball park with so much History. As an added treat the one and only Tommy LaSorda was there......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3407CBjosem
10,"Park Going Downhill with Grafitti, Garbage, and Homeless","Elysian Park might have pockets with green grass and clean picnic tables where families can gather, but it seems like 90% of the rest of the park is not kept up. Vegetation is underwatered...resulting in dead trees and dried up shrubbery and plants. There are areas (especially south of the 110 freeway) where homeless are taking over...I did not feel safe...one cannot wander off the main road onto trails. The homeless have left garbage everywhere...the city does not seem like they are cleaning it up. Radio Hill Gardens, once a wonderful spot, has completely been abandoned by the city...grafitti, turned over benches, and bags of homeless stuff are everywhere.My wife and I actually witnessed a completely (and I mean completely) naked man along one of the trails. I know that Los Angeles finances (thru taxes) a major homeless program and shelter, and the city should make sure these people are out of the park, being taken care of, so that the rest of the city can enjoy the parks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
50,Cool Swing!,Went up the very steep and slippery but short trail to find the secret swing and it was fantastic! Took a lot of awesome pics up there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyJ0914
50,Hidden swing,There 's a lot of spots where you can see the view of downtown LA . Take a nice drive here to see the sunset. There's a hidden swing located on top of the hill near Angel's point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mari_reys
40,Nice place for a run or a hike,"This park offers great views of L.A. Watching the skyline from afar whilst you're hiking in the wild is awesome. It is easy to find parking nearby and head up one of the trails. There's a playground at the foot of the hill, so if you bring children they might enjoy it there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CasperH
30,Run in Elysian Park,"Elysian Park is a nice get away natural place close to Dodger Stadium. Dirt trails wind around the park and closed/paved roads are in some areas as well. Some steep ups and downs. Lots of dog walkers and joggers, a few family picnics at tables. An 8km run saw almost 500 metres of elevation gain so it was definitely good exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlairP614
50,Great Place for a Picnic,"We went to a family event before a wedding. The park was beautiful and there was plenty of room so we could all stretch out. We had plenty of picnic tables, good proximity to bathrooms (which were clean), lots of shade. It all contributed to a relaxing day with old friends and new. I was very impressed the Los Angeles Park System and the employees we met with from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I13JAmarym
50,No pot holes,Whomever wrote the review about all the potholes hasn't been there recently the entire park is now been beautifully pay one of the best and often well-kept surprises in Los Angeles including a beautiful well hidden waterfall park behind the police academy and it to riffic little old world café,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluCap
50,Beautiful Views of L.A. cityscape,"I have lived in L.A. for 3+ years now. This is one of my favorite parks. I come here often. The last two years I have use this park to train for the Los Angeles Marathon. Great trails to run on. There are many hills that one could take. Really improves one's endurance and leg strength. I understand the road were rough with a lot of potholes but the city has come through now since we passed a bill to fix our parks and roads. As of today, March 18, 2015, the roads have been redone. The park has new life, the repaved roads really make a difference. And I'm not talking about just filling up the holes, they destroyed the old pavement and filled it with new pavement. I am happy they fixed them because now I can run on the roads at night and not be afraid to fall and trip from a pothole. They have also added a freesebee golf course which looks like a lot of fun. Another thing, this a great place for picnics, hiking, walking, running, playing with your dog(s) and your children, and also great place for mountain biking, and now with the repaved roads, road biking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambiguous420
40,Terrific vista of the L.A. area,"The road was a little rough (BIG potholes), though some parts of the park had better roads than other parts. The overlook offers a fantastic view, though -- it's worth the ride. Just keep your eyes on the road while you're getting to the parking lot up high. Also, you may think you're at the top, but go higher, there's more parking and even some picnic tables very nearby. We'll be back for a clear day (""Spare The Air Day"" haze when we were there). You can see the Los Angeles downtown skyline, the top of Dodger Stadium, the river/aqueduct, and a great example of L.A. highway spaghetti.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beakertroyd
40,"Nice day-hike, dog-walking spot","This is a good park -- easy trail with some shady spots and good views. Like all the parks in L.A., there's lots of people walking their dogs here. There's water for dogs at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingyogi
50,Great Views!,"Rode my bike through here today with a friend to avoid some construction in the surrounding area. Fantastic views! Very quiet! A nice place to ride your bicycle if you are into long, hard climbs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianrU4388XZ
40,Great park,"I went to the park on a Monday early afternoon. The park is beautiful and has a lot of walking trails and areas for activities, such as soccer, etc. The park also has a great view of the L.A. skyline and Dodgers Stadium.I spent about 90 minutes at the park, and I loved it. I would highly recommend going to the park if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blake_Reagan
30,Much open space close to the LAPD academy and Dodger stadium.,"Very crowded during weekends and holidays, otherwise, empty. Major commute path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schubeb
40,A hidden gem,"Most visitors, even many Angelenos, are not aware of this gem in the middle of the urban jungle of LA. Maybe they are aware, but never bother to to discover this green oasis. And what an oasis it is, about 570 acres of serenity and open space. A perfect place for playing, picnicking, hiking, walking the dog, relaxing and just enjoying the outdoors. The park also has fantastic views of the city from the top. It's a great way to spend a lazy afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustgyrl
50,Loved,"I love elysian park because of the great views that it has when riding your car the trees the trails that it has to hike on and especially the view of los Angeles, well I come from an hour away thats Santa Ana and I love to come to Elysian with freinds cause we like to run around this park and its a great work out we get from all the parks we been to its so far a good challenge for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel24939
