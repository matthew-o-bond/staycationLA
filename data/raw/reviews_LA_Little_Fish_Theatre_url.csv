40,Small but Enchanting,"Went here to see an immersive play about a young girl who joined a cult. The caliber of actors is a little scattered, from amazing to somewhat erratic. The theatre itself is very small and the he venue is incredibly difficult to find, but once there they put on a really good show! The staff is polite, the actors will speak with you after (at least when we went), and itâ€™s affordable. My one recommendation would be that for immersive plays, fair warning is given when there will not only be no intermission, but also when the the exits are a part of the play and no one can leave. Very unpleasant for claustrophobics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gunjer
50,OUTSTANDING acting in this little theater,"My husband and I recently attended 3 productions at Little Fish Theatre - OH, BABY; AND THE STONES WILL CRY OUT; SOMEONE WHO'LL WATCH OVER ME - and each of them demonstrated outstanding performances by well-cast actors. The subject matter varied tremendously from one play to another from humor to desperation, but in all cases we were engaged throughout and so impressed! They offer a wonderful program for subscribers: 6 or 10 ""anytime"" tickets, at a discount, that never expire and will give you a reserved seat, to boot! (individually purchased tickets have you choosing your seat when you arrive) The theater is truly tiny so you have an intimate experience with the performers. They also offer a dinner/theater price with dinner served at a nearby restaurant before the show, so you only have to park your car once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorraineo633
