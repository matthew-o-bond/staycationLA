40,Noted for the murals on its walls,"Part of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, Biscailuz Building was originally designed to serve as the United Methodist Church Conference Headquarters and the Plaza Community Center.It is situated on the site of the Juan Sepulveda adobe and today houses the Consulate General of Mexico.Named after Eugene Biscailuz a former LA County Sheriff, the building is noted for the murals on its walls. The most famous of these murals depicts the Blessing of the Animals, a creation of Leo Politi in 1979.A flight of steps down into the basement of Biscailuz Building is the Biscailuz Gallery. The Gallery has some very fascinating and educative panels about the founding of Los Angeles.For instance, the African ancestry of Los Angeles - no less than 26 of the original 44 pobladores (settlers) who travelled from New Spain in 1781 to colonize what became the pueblo of Los Angeles, were of African descent – the story of Los Angeles is thus inextricably woven with the story of Black Angelenos.There are panels that deal with the slave trade of the 18th century, about the race based ‘casta’ system, and the route followed by the founding families into Los Angeles.Other panels cover the establishment of the Spanish missions, presidios and pueblos, the government-issued land grants called ‘ranchos’ that were used to induce settlers from New Spain to come to California.Yet another interesting panel highlights the fascinating story of Biddy Mason who after being born a slave, won her freedom in court and ten years later, purchased land on Spring Street to become the first female African American landowner in all of Los Angeles!Admission to the Gallery is free. Despite such a treasure trove of information presented so attractively, it is strange that the Biscailuz Gallery seems to have very few visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon

50,Great murals and a beautiful building,"At first glance this appears to be another great structure to this historic area. However, don't not miss the artwork underneath the arches. There is a great mural depicting the blessing of the animals usually performed around St. Francis day. We bless the animals as well at our church and this picture depicts a great Mexican cultural moment doing the same. Take the time to see as it is another hidden gem of this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
