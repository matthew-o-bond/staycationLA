10,"Even if you can't use it, you're screwed.","I ordered a wifi device from this company, and checked that there is coverage for my choice of network.Before I went on the trip, I tested it and it worked just fine. When I got here, the signal was terrible and the speed was even slower than the most basic Internet plan here.The support I got was pretty good, although it was a little annoying that I was only referred to as ""Customer."" I did my best not to let this get to me.They offered to reset the signal and send me a new device, which didn't work. Then when they called me, they said ""there is no signal where you are!""There was a lot of coverage for T-Mobile in Mammoth Lakes. It's dark pink! My T-mobile phone works great here, and I should've used them instead of this company.I asked if they could send me a refund at all for this, and they said ""Nope.""So, here I am. Warning others that if you rent from this place, they don't give you your money back even if you did all the things you could to make sure it did work.It's a damn shame. You could've made a lot more money using basic business practices, but you resort to scamming others by not offering a refund.Good luck.",Tim W
50,Outstanding Guaranteed,"Have used Vision Global WiFi multiple times on my trips to Japan. It has proven to be 100% reliable throughout the country. The signal has proven effective enough to watch Netflix on my computer, support video conferences and connect me flawlessly on Whatsapp and LINE. Though not having used in the EU I would expect to have the same performance. My regular carrier would charge me $10 per day and I would use my own data plan. If I was to stay this would be $300.00 however, with VG WiFi 30 days would cost me less than $100 for a high speed 4G. connection.",Norman H
50,WiFi pickup at airport was very good.,They were prompt professional. When I asked where to drop off the unit at the other airport the divided a thorough map Only suggestion is they should have showed me how to turn the unit on. I was pressing down on the device for 30 mins when all I had to do was slide the button on. Battery lasts super long!!,Elizabeth P
50,Must have for Japan visit,"Easy pickup on the bottom floor in terminal 1 in KIX. This mobile wifi helped me so much in navigating through gps, posting or just watching videos on the Shinkansen. Will use again.",John B
10,Not convenient,I purchased the pocket WiFi 7 days package 11/17 - 11/24 from this provider for my trip departures on Nov 16 from US to London. I got the message from them that I need to change my duration from 11/15 -11/21 as they need to activate the services and deliver to my US address by 11/15 for my departure date on 11/16/19. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense as I didn‚Äôt start using it until 11/17 when I was in London and I actually had to pay for 2 days in advance of my trip without using it. I told the operator that but she said it was how it works. They also couldn‚Äôt deliver the pocket to my hotel in London. This pocket only works in London not other EU region.I had to cancel and rented a package from another provider ‚ÄúRent‚Äôn Connect‚Äù from Viator app. The new device worked so well in all EU region.,kimkhueto
50,it works!!,"second time renting , used it on trip to japan in july '19 and to spain this november. affordable, used the pickup and dropoff method in japan and the mail in and mail return for spain trip, both easy, reliable, service connectivity was excellent - highly recommend!",paulsQ713QT
40,Efficient and Reasonable,"The ""Global WiFi"" pick up was quick and efficient. I got the .5GB daily plan which was fast and sufficient for my needs for about $5.00 USD day..my phone carrier would have been $10 per day and not great coverage. The actual WiFi transmitter was a bit bulky, but it did allow for some battery back up and lasted the whole day. Drop off at the airport was simple and I got an email confirmation in a few days.I WOULD use them again!",Tommy D
50,Best portable wifi,This is my 2nd time renting a portable wifi device from them and they're great. I have it delivered to my house and it always arrives on time then when I send it back I always get en email when they receive it back after I return it. The speed of internet is good and the service is very good.I had a coupon last time but the customer service person couldn't seem to process it correctly so I didn't get my discount and it is a bit expensive but it's the best wifi device I've gotten so I will stick with them.,Rachael
50,So happy we rented the portable router!,"We used the router during our trip to the UK, London area and Leicester. We had great service and all 3 of us were able to log on easily and use at the same time. We are able to search on the web, get directions, and connect everywhere we went. It was great and well worth the money we spent. We had rented an extra battery just in case but we never needed it.",Dianne R
50,Jerusalem,Great service during my week long trip to the Holy Land. Thank you Vision Global for keeping me connected to my family while overseas.,Jessica R
50,Awesome Japan Trip Adventure,"Rented the unlimited 4G pocket wifi, pick up was at Osaka Kansai International airport in Japan.Made reservation purchase for the device online with debit card.Purchase was only 91 dollars USD for 3 weeks.Was very satisfied with purchase, and device comes with a charger,and a bag to keep the accessories in.Can't wait for my next in Osaka next year.üòÄüòÄ",Richard
50,London & Norway,"We were very happy with the Global WiFi. It did not work onboard the cruise ship, but we were aware of that going in. On shore in Norway and the week we spent in London we had great service. We did turn the unit off when not in use and once turning back on it did take 2-3 minutes to get up and running. We will use on future trips and we do recommend for England & Norway.",Tom L
10,Useless LTE Service,"We rented the Vision Global LTE WiFi Hotspot device for over 3 weeks. Not once did we get over 2mbps and that was while we were at Honolulu (a block from Waikiki Beach), Sacramento, LA and Las Vegas (we were standing outside MGM Grand Hotel which is right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip and still getting slow connections). Rachel the Customer Service Agent was fantastic and tried assisting us but we were then transferred over to Ri who was absolutely useless and unfriendly. Ri pretty much told us there was nothing that they could do and gave me some lame IT excuses although I had already advised in my conversation that my fulltime job is actually in IT so i know what to look out for and what sort of speed I should be getting from an LTE connection. We had to resort to using hotel and McDonald's free WiFi to research for our activities, etc. I wouldn't recommend Vision Global to anyone and would never use them again.",Wi-Hean T
50,Narita and Haneda,"First, I have picked up my wifi unit at both Haneda and Narita airports. This review will cover both airports.Once you are able to find the pickup point (which can be daunting) everything else is superior. Haneda pickup location is easier to find than Narita pick up location. Follow the directions as best you can and you will be fine.The customer service is great - standard for Japan. Don't forget your papers. Literally took about 1-minute start to finish and walking away. I have rented the wifi device four times and it has always performed flawlessly. Which means I had full phone, tablet, and pc connectivity 24/7. I could watch movies, connect to skype, WhatsApp, LINE, etc without any limitation. I used the 4G LTE unlimited plan. I used apps for all phone calls and texts.During my most recent rental in August, I received a special deal and got a discount plus an extra battery pack charger. The difference in price between using my data overseas through AT&T and using Vision Wifi was $119.00 in favor of Vision for 21 days in Japan. This was a no brainer. I travel to Japan 2-4 times per year this is, in my humble opinion, the best way to stay connected locally and internationally. Nuff said.",Norman H
50,Great wifi - hassle free,"Got the wifi device delivered to hotel and dropped off at airport.Had the 10 GB/month Verizon and it worked were ever Verizon had coverage (the best coverage in US, especially country side).Even though the device showed usage over 10GB we had no disruption of service.Great to have wifi while traveling.Only negative is that they sent to hotel many days before my start/check-in date and the hotel name was not on the address label, but their company was on the ""to"" address. Both of these things alone could result in the hotel not accepting the package.Luckily for me, the hotel have received it and had it in a storage room.",Marius P
50,Must have while travelling,Vision Global WiFi is my go-to WiFi rental company. It is so convenient and keeps me connected while on the go.Especially helpful when you need to access your maps.,3DGOs
50,Product worked well and ordered for pick up at Narita airport.,Hotspot worked well and definetly needed in Japan for transportation and tourism sites. Only recommend that the instructions on where to find the counter be more explicit and use correct name. Took over 30 minutes and asking several information desk staff before finding them at the very end of the concourse.,czumbrun
50,Working,"Excellent service. Everyone should have one while traveling. It is so convenient, specially with teens.",BrainSmith
50,Don't travel without it!!,"I love a good paper map, but we were going to spend a week in Tokyo and most of the streets don't have names. This rental was so easy to get and was 1000% worth the money. My husband and I were on the WiFi constantly and we had no connection issues and we were able to use GPS, post to Instagram, use Google Translator and play Pokemon Go all day long. NOW, make sure you have a battery pack to charge the WiFi and give it some time to cool down too when you don't need it. We went in August and the heat and humidity were intense and although the WiFi got pretty hot, it still worked great! Pickup at Haneda airport was FAST and EASY! Drop off was even easier! Just drop it in the return box and go! I will be renting from Vision Global WiFi any time we travel internationally!",PeePeeOhPee
40,Vision Global Wifi - Japan - Good but bring a portable battery,"We rented out Vision's Global Wifi hotspot on our trip to japan. The process picking up the hotspot and returning it was fairly simple although we did get a bit lost finding the pick up point (first time in Narita). The speed of the hotspot was great given that both my wife and I were occasionally using the hotspot simultaneously. The main issue we had was with the battery life. The battery would seem to drain fairly quickly, within about 5 hours. We mostly used the hotspot to figure out train routes, find restaurants and places to visit, but we would have still have to make sure to turn it off when not using it to save battery for our return trip home at the end of the day. Bring a portable battery just incase! While the battery was annoying, it did force us to explore and the service was still very useful.",Jeffrey N
50,Trip to LIma Peru,"Actually I rented in the USA for use in LIma Peru. Delivery and return by USPS.I have used this device in Japan, Europe and several times in Peru. I works very well. However, if you connect the limit of five devices the speed will degrade significantly. Also, make sure the device is close. Check the instructions.It is great for normal internet use. But I don't think it works well for videos like Netflix or videos with heavy date use.I have used for emails, messages, social networks, communication, etc. with good signal. In some places in the andes or Peru it also works but it becomes much slower. Sometimes you have to reset it.It is the only company I use and I am happy with it.",Francisco A
50,easy to use and provided us with uninterrupted connection,"I rented their pocket wifi on our trip to japan. pick up was super easy and quick and connecting to it was also a breeze. kept 2 phones, a switch and an ipad with internet connection our whole trip. also the pocket wifi has very good battery life.",Nygel D
50,Easy to pick up and easy to return. It was useful for my trip in Malaysia and Singapore.,"Their office is located very close to my office. To make a reservation is easy and pick up and return was also easy. I initially chosen this service only for trip in Malaysia. But they told me that I can keep access wifi connection in Singapore as well. I went to KL, JB and some local city, 90% of time worked great. Of course you won't get any signal in the forest. I will use their service for next trip.",Akira T.
50,Excellent for Japan! :),"I spent two weeks traveling solo in Japan in May 2019, and I pretty much was able to navigate the Kansai region, Hiroshima, and the Tokyo Metropolitan area (I visited a total of 8 cities in 15 days) without much trouble. The pocket wifi was super reliable ‚Äì just be sure to charge it every night and to have a backup portable battery!I picked mine up from Amnet in Costa Mesa and returned it without any issues; the Amnet customer service in Costa Mesa is fantastic, and this was my second time using their services to travel Japan (they also advise and provide JR rail passes for purchase).As long as you're not livestreaming and/or streaming videos/media all the time (and if you are, what is even the point of traveling?) I consider the pocket wifi from Global Vision an absolute must for anyone who is traveling to Japan.I will be visiting their services again for traveling globally in the future for other pocket wifi options :)",Q. Le
20,Very unreliable service for the price,"We paid for 4G service. Received 3G most of the time. In addition, unreliable service in Rome, Italy and Paris, France. Not recommended if traveling to these countries. You are better off utilizing restaurant and cafe wifi. Would have given 1 star; but given 2 stars for responsive customer service. Excellent customer service. Unsatisfactory internet service. Not worth the price. Please check other service providers.",Mercurysantana
50,Best pocket WiFi and best rates,"I‚Äôve used Vision Global twice in Japan and twice in Europe. Every time the service is great and the prices are the best I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve used the home delivery option and the pick up at Narita option and both have gone smoothly. Vision Global‚Äôs pocket WiFis have been a life saver for navigating the streets and trains of Tokyo and for GPS directions when I‚Äôve rented cars in Iceland, Germany, and England. I recommend them to my friends when they travel to Japan or to Europe. Can‚Äôt say enough good things!",tinderandtwig
50,"Best Price, Easy to Use","After searching comparing a few pocket WiFi rental companies, I found that Vision Global WiFi gives the most competitive price! I applied to rent a Japan - Unlimited 4G Advanced pocket WiFi in February for my trip to Japan in March.At the time I submitted my application, I'm pretty sure there was a shipping fee and a fee for picking up at LAX, so I decided to do a free pickup at their office in Gardena.If you are picking up at their office, they ask that you pick up the pocket WiFi the day before your indicated departure date just to ensure they have enough in inventory. That was pushing it a little too close for me, so I e-mailed them to ask if I could pick it up a few days earlier, and they were perfectly okay with it.I had no issues with the device, and actually found it really easy to use. The signal was strong and my boyfriend and I were able to use our phones and do work on our laptops with no problems during our 12 day trip.If you're going to Japan, I would recommend 10/10 it's a lot easier than those phone cards or trying to find a place with WiFi!!",victoriadlai
50,Perfect!,"This worked perfectly for a week in France! This WiFi was delivered a couple days earlier than expected, and returning it was so easy. Can‚Äôt recommend enough, and will definitely use Vision Global WiFi next time we travel abroad.",ecastleberg
50,Best Pocket Wi-Fi for Japan,"We rented a pocket WiFi from Vision Global. Picked it up at KIX (Kansai) and returned it to CTS (Sapporo) and it worked perfectly as we traveled around Japan whether we were walking, in shops, at UNESCO World Heritage Sites, or on the train. There were 4 people in our party and we all were able to have fast internet service to access the latest train schedules, Instagram, FB, etc. and even make calls using Skype and WhatsApp. Picking up the device at KIX was pretty easy, returning it to Sapporo was a little more challenging to find the return location at the airport since we didn't speak Japanese and needed directions. There are discount coupons on the web. Lastly, I connected the pocket Wi-Fi to my power bank which kept us connected for some of our longer 12-17 hr travel days. The only time we had no service was when traveling by bus through the several mile long tunnels on the way to Shirakawa-go.",steve c
50,"(Texas). Awesome customer service, T-Mobile option a little slow","This was my second time using Vision Global and I'm totally happy once again. I had a family member visiting Texas from Japan so I had the device mailed to Texas and it arrived prior to my date, which was nice. Afterward, I just mailed it right back. I like the fact that when I had a question, I could just pick up the phone and get a prompt response from a human, not an automated voicemail. They're also very responsive on email. The only point I was not totally happy with was that the T-Mobile service was very slow (1.3 MBPS) . I called and was told, more or less, that's the way T-Mobile is which is a puzzling response because my own T-Mobile cellphone was able to pull about 5 MBPS in the same locations as the Vision Global device. ... oh well, First World problems, right?I'll gladly use this company again.",Joseph E
50,Would have been lost without it!,"I used the pocket Wi-Fi in Portugal and Morocco and could not have been happier with the service. It even worked in all of the tiny alleyways of the Medina in Marrakech and in remote areas like the Sahara Desert. It gave us the extra added security and flexibility to explore as much as we wanted, all an affordable cost. I will definitely be using this service again for future trips. Thank you Vision Global!!",Kayla T
50,Great and convient service for pocket wifi,"This is the 3rd time I used their service when traveling to Japan. I've used it for both business and family trips. Their staffs are very friendly and helpful. Best of all, I enjoy the convenience of picking up and dropping of the wifi at LAX international terminal. Their website is also easy to use. If anything, I wish that their wifi can last a whole day with a single charge.",hly

50,Worked great,Took a bit of time in figuring out where to pick it up. Finally asked at information and was instructed to go to the Currency Exchange booth. But once that was sorted it went quite smooth. Easy to use and worked very well. Only thing was the screen was in Chinese (perhaps we could have changed it to English we didn‚Äôt both to try to figure it out since we managed fine anyway. Nice to have data wherever we went!,KellyC7771
50,Portable WiFi in Argentina!,I was using another company that went out of business and was concerned I wouldn't find another equally reliable option but my concerns were allayed when I discovered and used Vision Global Wifi. I've been to Argentina twice and to India once with the device sent to me through Vision Global Wifi and the service has been excellent and the cost worth every penny. Have not had any problems with the device and any questions I had about throttling were answered and clarified.,frequentflier63

50,Convenient & works perfectly,"Renting Wi-Fi was the best decision we made all trip. Just carry it around with you in your pocket and you will never have a single problem with any of your devices! I would recommend buying the wireless charger with it so you aren't worried about the battery life, but it lasted us most of the day before we went back to the hotel to recharge. Super easy to pick up and drop off- we ended up leaving a day early and from a different airport and Vision was kind enough to let us do it that way.",katetriz
