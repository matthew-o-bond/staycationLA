50,Still the Best Theater to See a Musical in Los Angeles,"The Pantages in Hollywood is still the best venue to see a musical in all of Los Angeles, if not all of California. You don't have to go to New York to see all the Broadway shows you have yearned to see. Sure, you have to wait a bit for them to come to LA and sometimes it is the touring cast, but they are amazing.Everything about the Pantages is wonderful. It is on Hollywood Blvd., right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Great places to dine or grab a burger are all within walking distance. There is ample parking for a fee.The place is just beautiful, kept in great condition it still has the interior or Art Deco from the 40's and the place is kept spotless. The service there is just great. Everyone is kind and just wants you to have the best time.Also, the pricing at the Pantages is within reach for most people. Tickets start at about 50$ US for the far back and from 100-300 for the very front. But the thing about the Pantages is that it is not huge so there really is not a bad seat in the house. The sound is updated. You will love it.My last outing, we go a lot, was in February, right before the Covid lock-down, was with my grandson, who I am always with, to see Frozen. The lead singer was magical. The entire production was magical. We had to the best time and so will you.It is closed right now because of Covid, but will start selling tickets for early next year very soon. See you there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Beautiful theatre,We saw the Aladdin Musical at the Pantages Theatre. It is a beautiful building with lovely interior. The staff were friendly and the seating is well organised. There is a pay and display next door to use. Lovely trip to the theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenr0ck
50,Always a Great Venue,"We have seen many productions at the Pantages Theater and have never once been disappointed with this venue. We just saw ""The Simon and Garfunkle Story"" there, and the sound was amazing! The art deco everywhere is eye candy, and the parking was easy peasy.One word of warning: we got our parking ticket online at ParkWhiz and paid $10. When we pulled into the lot (watch for yellow and black signs for the Pantages/Avalon Bars parking), just around the corner on Vine Street and behind the theater, they were charging $30 CASH ONLY. Wow, we saved $20 by getting our ticket online. I had printed it out, and the attendant waved us in and told us to put the printout on our dashboard. For those who don't get their ticket online and don't have the cash, there is an ATM machine next to the lot kiosk.There are plenty of ushers in the theatre, even in the restrooms to make sure things are moving quickly and efficiently.If you have extra time, it's interesting to walk along the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Blvd. and also on Vine Street looking at the sidewalk stars of Hollywood celebrities. Also right there on Vine is the iconic Capitol Records building, the world's first circular office building.The lobby is art deco-gorgeous...take time to look around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedcampgirl
40,"Beautiful theater, smaller seats, nice prices",I went to see both Aladdin and Frozen at this theatre. This is a beautiful place. Like most theatres built during this time the seats are small and if you are bigger you will very likely be uncomfortable.They do allow food into the theatre so that can ruin the ambiance a bit especially after intermission when the most snacking is taking place.Parking is not great because this is directly in the middle of the walk of fame so if you have a show prepare to arrive early so that you can find a good place. Just know the street parking is max of 2 hours and most show run longer than that so it might be best to just pay to park in the nearby garages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybO6789RN
50,Frozen,"Amazing play, good seating no matter where you sit. Small theatre, sound is amazing. Highly recommended for adults or children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noreenc2014
40,"Loved the Broadway musical, “Frozen”","4 Stars for the Pantages, 10 stars for Frozen ♥️We have seen a few Disney musicals at the Pantages and this is the favorite! The only reason for the 4 stars is the sound system. We sat in the orchestra section, row W, and there were moments in the play when the voices were not clear as a bell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
10,"Awesome production, great facility, yet a less than acceptable experience.","Took my wife yesterday for the Frozen musical and really really really wanted us to have a good time. The show was excellent - and so was the place itself.Why only one star then? We arrived at7 pm, with the show starting at 8. Ticketing was easy and efficient, and my wife thought she had plenty of time to see the bathroom. No way - after cueing for almost an hour, she was ushed into the theatre before being able to do so.I tried my luck in the men's room, and wooo-hoo, I made it. I would have loved to get water, but seeing a bathroom and getting a drink: impossible.The theatre's management really has to step up their game. Or not. After all, this is Hollywood, enough potential for the three big F (find em, f*ck em, forget em). Sorry, lads.By the way: if you go (and the show was really excellent, there is excellent parking on Vine at the Chase bank - $9,50 for 2-8 hours, one less than five minutes walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
50,Saw Frozen in a magnificent theatre,"The Pantages is an absolutely beautiful palace of Art Deco architecture. The theater is just magnificently decorated as are the other parts of the theater. The lobby is also very impressive. Built in the time of vaudeville, the seats are very comfortable and the sight-lines are all very good. Truly not a bad seat in the house, even from the mezzanine (or balcony). The sound quality in the theater is fantastic. It was a wonderful place to experience Disney's Frozen. A true landmark on Hollywood Boulevard at Vine Street. There is a Metro Red Line Station right across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Amazing Frozen production,"Pantages is on Hollywood Blvd right by the famous Walk of Fame with the Hollywood stars. The area around can be a little sketchy with lots of homeless people camping there. However, if you are walking to your destination and not just strolling you should be OK. We parked next to the Pantages (for 20$!!) because we didn’t want to walk too far. The theater has an exuberant decor from the golden age of movies. Really impressive. The seats are well placed. Wherever you are seating you can see clearly. It is rare nowadays in theaters and venues. Of course, there is no filming or photos allowed once the presentation starts. But Frozen was amazing, I think better than the movie. Excellent singers and amazing stage decors. Really first class.Beware that there is no outside food and beverages. Small water cost 4$ and a soda 8$!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanancha
10,Only understood 1/2 the words,"We saw Jesus Christ Superstar last night. Having seen it in the 70's , we were excited to enjoy it again. The only lead singer that we understood most of the words was Mary Magdalene. The other 2 lead singers ( Jesus and Judas )screamed into the microphone, and were impossible to understand. We were seated in the Orchestra section near the front but on the far right. Maybe it was a Pantages problem , others seated to our left seemed to enjoy it . At the end of the show , I had no idea how many changes were made from the original production as this version was hard to follow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/540artb
50,Rousing entertaining in ornateness,"We were intrigued as to the approach taken to the famous story of Anastasia. What was presented was a exuberant and highly entertaining take on the most famous child of the last Czar.The production was excellent resulting in brilliant sets that segued seamlessly from one location to the next. Colourful throughout, the players were marvellous with most engaging characters.A further star of course was the gorgeous theatre itself. In the heart of Hollywood this art décor gem was completed in 1930. It was the final theatre commissioned by the impressario Alexander Pantages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Absolutely stunning,Went here during our California trip to see the Blueman Group. Amazing show and wonderful atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blueeyedcanadian74
50,Landmark beauty,Stunning interior. Throw back to an elegant earlier time. Marvel at the architectural details. The history of the Pantages is worth exploring and enhances the experience of enjoying performances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864joep
50,Beautiful...,We enjoyed watching Les Miserables at this theatre more because of the ambience. Great staff and well organized! Beautiful theatre!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmyshuz
50,I LOVE this beautiful theatre!,"If you have an opportunity to see a show at the Pantages, I would highly recommend it. There are many wonderful restaurants nearby, and the theatre is absolutely beautiful. A must-see in my book.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/428lesliem
50,Phantom of the Opera,"Phantom of the Opera was an amazing experience, my 1st ever! From entering the Pantages theater up until the end of the event, I was mesmerized with the elegance and beauty of the theater. The audience generated an electric atmosphere and the case was amazing. All the special effects and lighting were overwhelming and just brilliant. Highly recommend any event at The Pantages. We're so lucky in LA to have such a beautiful theater and so many shows to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesNavarro
40,Great Performances at This Landmark Location,My wife and I have been to this location several times to see some first-rate musicals. The interior design is a throwback to the Art Deco days of Hollywood. The sound quality is amazing and the sight lines from most of the seats are great. Plenty of restaurants in the area to have dinner before hand and parking was not hard to find. My only concern was intermission the bathroom break can be harrowing. Lines for both men's and women's restrooms were extremely long. You could miss part of the second act if you don't move quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape113347
50,I will definitely be going back!,We just saw Phantom of the Opera there last week. My daughter and I like to visit different theaters in different cities and this one did not disappoint!! We were in the mezzanine row H and it was a GREAT view. Comfy seats and obviously a fantastic show!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846andreah
50,Phantom of the opera touring,"I’ve seen Phantom of the Opera thrice now. Twice in Pantages and once in the Ahmason. I Love this theater because it’s old school Hollywood glamor. This particular company (US touring) has been my favorite so far! I just went today and let me tell you. I was so very happy I got front row middle orchestra for this! It was magical and delightful. I’ve never really cared about Carlotta or Raoul, but my goodness! Trista Maldivian and Jordan A Craig are amazing! Their vocal ranges and renditions were the best of their characters I’ve heard yet. I wish Jordan A Craig had an Instagram because I feel like his Talent and good looks need to be noticed. I thought it was very sweet Derrick Davis was outside taking pictures with fans after the production. Eva Tavares’ rendition of “think of me” was emotionally provoking. I honestly would go back again just to watch my favorite play. I would also go back if any of these talents worked other roles here. Truly enjoyable and the set was the most imaginative yet utilitarian of all the times I’ve seen this play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Innerfatkid
50,Pantages Visit,Went to see Phantom of the Opera in this theatre. The decor was stunning and the seats comfortable. The production itself was excellent especially the sound. Ticket 'on the night' well priced and we got a bump up in terms of location. Nice....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IaninPerthshire
40,Stunningly beautiful Art Deco inside.,"Recently saw Les Miserables at the Pantages. The exterior is somewhat unassuming but once inside you really get a good glimpse of the golden years of hollywood. What a gorgeous place. Good accoustics but seats in the back are a bit impaired visually. If you go to see a performance here, do NOT go hungry or thirsty. Your wallet will be cleaned out. $8.00 for a cup of coffee is absurd. This was the only negative other than the usual for any theatre, not enough bathroom space and too short of an intermission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloften028
50,"Love, Love, Love the Pantages Theater!","We bought a mini season subscription to the Pantages this year. So many good productions including Cats, Les Mis, Hello Dolly, and Wicked. We went with Sunday 6:30 pm shows, so traffic is light from the Westside, even though the theater is deep Hollywood. Parking is $20 pretty much everywhere, but very convenient. The Pantages is old Hollywood at its best! The interior is something you have to see to believe. We love the Pantages because the seating is fantastic. They alternate seats in each row so no one is directly in front of you and the orchestra floor has a slight rise so you are high enough above the row in front of you. Music Center is not like this (which makes me hesitate to see shows there). One downside is the line for the ladies’ room at intermission. It is excessively long, but at least it’s well managed. You can just about make it through and have a brief time to buy a beverage (allowed in the theater - such a treat since all other venues don't allow food or drink). The problem comes if the theater is sold out and you have good up-close seats. By the time you make it to the ladies’ room, the line is over 100 women long. For Les Mis, by the time my daughter and I got through it the show had already started by several minutes. Scrabbling in the dark across the seats was unfortunate for us and the others already seated. Good thing we got our snacks before the show. So other than the bathroom situation, the Pantages is my first choice to see Broadway productions. Can’t wait to see Frozen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitan434
50,Loved It!,The Pantages Theater is a beautiful treat. The lobby and interior spaces are breath-taking. The rich beauty of the walls and ceilings are amazing.We saw Les Miserables. The performance was outstanding. The sound system is excellent.We are eager to return for another performance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LewB_13
50,Accessible First rate entertainment (season tickets are worthwhile),"For many years my family and I have attended shows here, and there is so much to see and do in the area around the theater. It is walking distance from reasonable lodging. It isn't permitted to drop off and pick up in front of the theater so it is not as crowded and frantic there. Individuals with walking impairments might need to have assistance to get into the theater but there is plenty of accommodative seating there. It is a first class experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bugnurse56
50,A Truly Prestigious Art Deco Palace,"I came here to see Les Miserables on Saturday and this is easily one of the most beautiful theaters in all of Los Angeles, if not the most! It is a gorgeous, opulent theater built in 1930 and is lavishly decorated with statues, paintings, light fixtures and Art Deco motifs throughout. Not a single inch of this place is without ornamentation and it seems that no expense was spared in its construction even at the start of the Great Depression.Whether it’s the foyer, lobby, or main auditorium, there’s also something to look at and be entranced by. The effect is just dazzling and mesmerizing to see, even before the main spectacle that is the show itself, which was amazing. Everyone in the cast was superb and provided great, memorable moments such as Marius (Joshua Grosso) clearing his throat while singing to Jillian Butler’s Cosette (wonderful bit of comic relief) and Nick Cartell as Jean Valjean singing the show-stopping “Bring Him Home” which received some of the longest, loudest applauses of the whole night and sent shivers down my spine.If I had any complaints it would be the prices for snacks which were ten dollars for a cookie (to be fair it was kind of a big cookie) and a water bottle, but I guess that’s kind of to be expected, I can’t comment on the merchandise but that’s probably going to be pricey as well. I highly recommend everyone see a show at the Pantages at least once, it is a truly a night to remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Wow!!!,Beautiful decor. Makes you feel special being there among all the richness. Parking is nearby as well as restaurants. Can walk the sidewalk and see stars’ names. Try to go to one show for the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545kareno
50,One of my favorites!!,This theater is one of my favorite ones to go to! It is beautiful inside and all of the broadway shows that I have seen there have been excellent! I highly recommend catching a show there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjorchard
50,Always a Good Time,"Whether you are a big musical fan (most of their shows), looking for a date night, or want to do something with the family. It's a fun outing (I saw Fiddler on the roof) and if your debating seeing a show, buy the tickets. Make it a whole thing! Get a drink before and hit up your favorite late night spot after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Futurefirstlady
50,We saw Cats for the third time,This was the best Cats that w have ever seen. The dancing and the singing and everything about this was so wonderful Our friends agreed. The group who did this cats were physically wonderful dancers singers and whatever else that was prsented. I would see it again if I could!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineA705
50,Beautiful Theatre,"The theatre itself is beautiful. We sat in the back of the lower level and had no trouble seeing the play or hearing it. Long lines for the bathrooms during intermission but they moved quickly. Not as much choice for drinks and snacks as I would have hoped but it helps keep the line quick.It’s on Hollywood Blvd. so parking is tough but we parked with the valet parking at the hotel across the street. It was a bit of wait after the play to get the car. And it was expensive. So Uber if you can, or get there early to find a spot on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
50,Wonderful,It is always a pleasure. We saw CAT'S last night. It was amazing. I love that we have such a historic theatre in Hollywood. When you walk in it takes you back in time. It is old but well preserved. Such history when you look around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939beverlyk
50,broadway comes to Los Angeles,have seen many plays here and will see many more. beautiful theatre comfy seats great selections of plays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicenurse1
40,Still a great venue,Saw a matinee of Cats and remembered how I really enjoy this place. A throwback to the Art Deco age the Pantages has modernize without compromising its past.Outside the theater Hollywood has started to clean up its act which helps keep the Pantages relevant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterlP2566QG
50,They are so organized,"You know how going potty during intermission is a race against time? So much pressure to get through the line and get back to your seat in time for show to continue. Doesn't help when as soon as you enter the lobby ushers are yelling ""18 minutes left"", when you haven't made your way to the line. Well, I gotta say they were very organized. They had the line set up like Disneyland, and there was a lady inside telling us which stalls were open, and reminding people that the bathroom was not the time to be on their cellphone and to wait until afterwards. I thanked her, and told her that she made using the bathroom a ""pleasurable experience"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997tanyan
50,Hollywood History!,"Beautiful, historic theater in the heart of Hollywood. Great Art Deco architecture. Take in a show if you can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
50,Wicked!,My husband and I saw Wicked here and it was amazing! One of the best theaters I’ve been to. Elegant architectural design from the staircase to the theater. There’s a lot of parking lots in the area. And the food? It’s on Hollywood Blvd so restaurants are a wide range of fast food to fine dining. It doesn’t require a dress code but this is the kind of place you would want to dress up for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5551WQmariaf
50,Kinky Boots!,Love the ornate architecture. This is how a theatre should look and feel:-) The only thing I didn't like is the temperature was too warm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2trade
50,A classic and beautiful performance venue,"The Pantages Theatre is located right by the legendary intersection of Hollywood and Vine in Hollywood. It’s been a fixture on Hollywood Boulevard since it opened in 1930 as a combination movie theater and vaudeville stage (I still remember seeing movies there in the early 1970s), and hosted the Academy Awards throughout the 1950s. In 1977 it was converted to a full-time live performance venue with about 2,700 seats, making sure to maintain all its classic art deco design elements.NOTE that parking in Hollywood always presents a challenge. Most theater-goers park in one of the nearby parking garages, but exiting the garage after the show can be quite a slow process. We’ve had better luck parking in one of the surface lots in the area.When you enter the lobby, be sure to pause and take in the beauty and history evident in the architecture. You’ll find a large snack bar here, but you should NOTE that only snack items and beverages are sold; if you want something more substantial, you should plan to enjoy a meal locally beforehand.The seats are comfortable and there is more-than-adequate legroom. The acoustics are outstanding and the sightlines are good throughout the theatre. TIP: If you’re trying to decide between purchasing seats in the rear orchestra or front mezzanine sections, I recommend the front mezzanine as the sightlines are less obstructed by taller audience heads.The theatre employees were professional and helpful. The temperature in the theatre was comfortable. We’ve enjoyed many performances at the Pantages, and this one (“Wicked”) was no exception. The combination of a great show at a stunningly beautiful venue pretty much ensures a wonderful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinDan
40,West Coast Broadway Venue,"If you’re in town and are a theater buff, treat yourself to an evening or matinee show at Pantages. The detail inside on the walls and ceiling at gorgeous. Seating is pretty tight between rows but that’s the only ding(we’ll if you’re a lady, the lines for the restroom during intermission are pretty horrible as well)You can get very cheap seats on Goldstar app for practically any day. You’re likely to see some familiar faces in the crowd.Many dinner choices around, and the Star Walk of fame stretches from the Pantages west to Hollywood and Highland about a 1/2 mile away.Parking is costly as it is anywhere in LA for an event so Take a ride share.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrylQ3610HY
40,Came to see Wicked,"So I didn't give it a 5 star, only because you cannot take drinks to your seats. Overall though it would be a 5 star. The place is amazing, and the seating is good. We were directly in the middle for the show about half way back. Seats are comfortable, and sound is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tykane01
50,A Worthy Experience,"This is a stunning, historic theatre, and the closest you can get in the West Coast to having a theatre experience like New York City’s Broadway or London’s West End. The shows are very high quality, and so are the audio and the ambience. However, I found the audience to be a bit rude compared to when I last saw a show at the West End. People were more respectable and considerate of one another there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C0DY6

50,Wicked,Checked off two from my bucket list. Wicked Broadway production and my first visit to the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. What an amazing historic property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesM611
50,Beautiful Art Deco theatre,"A first visit to this huge theatre, it’s very wide but even in the rear of the dress circle the view is good, if a little distant. Therefore if that is where your seats are, take binoculars (or you can hire them for $10 at the theatre). The entrance foyer is amazing, well worth time just looking at the statutes and panelling, it’s a history lesson in itself.Be prepared for long lines in the interval to purchase snacks to. or use the restrooms, there are a lot of people and not that many places to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grahamd738
50,Pantages: Ups and Downs,"Beautiful theater on the inside. The outside isn't much. Big, 2800 seats, so best get tickets/seats up front, of course it means more $$. And it ain't cheap here. Problem - bought tickets to Wicked (loved it) at $152 each. Then I go online the day of the show, and the tickets are now $88 in my row and the row in front of me. Ticketmaster says it's new ""demand-pricing"". So you get penalized for buying your tickets early in advance. Not good. Also, no paper tickets. It's all on phone now. Hope your phone's battery doesn't konk out! Lots of kinks here - they still need to work on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25kena
50,A great experience at Pantages Theatre,"Pantages is a classic and well-known theatre located near Hollywood and Vine in LA.It's a great place to go if you are in town for a few days and want to experience a bit of classic LA and Hollywood.It is a small venue with only about 2600 seats so most seats are pretty good even if they are relatively cheap. They play mainly traditional broadway shows. I went to see Wicked and it was a great show.The building itself is pretty amazing. Very ornate and very 1930s. The building also has a great history. It was the venue for the oscars back in the day. It's worth going just to see the building.It's easy to get Uber to or from downtown and there are cabs lined up after the show.It's also easy to use the Red Line Metro train. The Hollywood and Vine station is right across the street.Dress is varied, but mostly pretty casual with most people in jeans. There is limited food inside. The coffee was good but $8 a cup is rather steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7801QRdavidr
50,The Bronx Tale,I love The Pantages Theater in Hollywood. Have seen many productions in the past years. There is not a bad seat in this theater and it's old world decor and nostalgia is still beautiful. I highly recommend this theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mscorinns
40,Stunningly beautiful restored ArtDeco theater,"Is every cool building in this town Art Deco? No, it just seems like it. This 1930's theater has been totally restored and it is beautiful. And it is still functioning. One of the nicer Art Deco restorations in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
50,Bronx Tale. Not for kids under 10,We saw Bronx Tale. Acting. Singing. Music. Performance. Story all good. However unless you want your children to be ok with the EF word and the GD word and hear about some topics that i believe are inappropriate for kids. You might want to go just as adults or wait till your kids are older. We had to leave before the first act was even over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel
50,We Just Love The Pantages,"I take my grandson to the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood so often, that I would bore you if I reviewed them every time. It is just a marvelous theater to see a musical or band. All of the seats are good and some are great. Try to grab the first 20 rows of the center orchestra if you can. The mezzanine is also great. The balcony is a bit far back, but you will still have great sound and you will be able to see.This time we saw Bronx Tale. Our seats were off to the left of the orchestra and we were happy campers. The sound there is always great and not too loud. All the plays are well put on and entertaining.The theater itself is just stunning. It is all art deco and looks like a theater from the 40's. It is so well maintained. If you are ever in Hollywood, catch a play. Check their website for seating, but they do sometimes have seats at curtain time.What we especially love about the Pantages is the staff. They are always so welcoming and they know the theater well. They will help you with seating or whatever you may need. They are just super sweet.There are a ton of great restaurants near by as well as the W Hotel if you want to stay in town. Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Beautiful theater,What a beautiful theater. We were upstairs and thought the view was great. They have the bathrooms figured out...... no problem as a woman getting in and using the bathroom with plenty of time during intermission (unlike the theaters in Chicago and Minneapolis). Ushers were great..... stopped a “chatter” during the performance..... appreciated that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuli763
50,Great classic threater,"Musicals and other venues presented at the Pantages are first class. The theater it's self is beautiful in the Art Nouveau style. The lighting and sound are great. It all works together to make a wonderful performance. Do your self a favor and come about an hour and a half early; and go to the W Hotel (directly across the street) for a drink and munchies. Of course, you can also do dinner before or after the performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lleon2014
50,Charming and Evocative of an age gone by!,"We have been to the Pantages MANY times, from when I was a kid in the 60's to actually see movies, and as an adult to see dozens of plays including Lion King, Wicked, Mama Mia, Pricilla Queen of the Desert, dozens more and most recently, Beautiful (about the life of Carole King). We usually sit in the lower levels but this time was a last minute booking which found us in the middle of the balcony. I must admit that if the show you are seeing does not really require a close up (as this one did not) the view of the ceiling and boxes along the upper sides is nothing short of spectacular, including the art deco chandelier. The acoustics are awesome so no matter where you actually sit, the sound is marvellous. If you have not been and are considering a show, it comes with our highest recommendations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashebroe

Get a drink or food st 33 Taps next door post-show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,The Pantages is a memorable place for entertainment,"We have been to many plays at the Pantages over the years. It is an old Art Deco theater that has most of the large touring Broadway shows. The old theater drips with nostalgia. when you think of the historic entertainment that played there over the years, you will be humbled.We sat up in the mezzanine for the play ""The Waitress"". You could see and hear everything. One drawback is the seats, they make airline seats seem comfortable, ""Ouch"".Its location on Hollywood Blvd. with the stars walk of fame make it a destination in itself. If you can catch a play here, do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
40,Wonderful Atmosphere in this Art Deco Venue.,"The interior is a lush and gorgeous setting for any theatrical presentation. They've done a wonderful job keeping up this favorite Hollywood venue. I just saw an amazing performance by the lead actress in ""Waitress"", but my guest marveled at the theater. Parking is about $20 during performances which is expensive, but the red line subway is the only alternative in this area. I'm pleasantly surprised that there are more and better dining options nearby; in the past I recall pizza by the slice and other choices that didn't match up with being dressed up for theater, but I counted 5 okay places within walking distance if you had tickets for the evening's show. Seems like there were less panhandlers than there were a few years ago as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,Favorite Theatre in California,"The Pantages is an ornately beautiful Art Deco inspired theatre in the heart of Hollywood, which hosts Broadway national touring productions. Over its history it has hosted vaudeville acts, concerts, and was even a movie theatre.Once you walk inside the lobby you immediately notice soaring ceilings adorned with gorgeous chandeliers. Inside the theatre, one can look around forever taking in all the wonderful minute details in architecture that make this theatre a special venue.Although places like the Disney concert hall or even Ahmanson have better acoustics, the Pantages still has great sound quality.The line up of productions every year is usually superior to any other single venue.There are a lot of parking options around the theatre varying in prices from $10 to $30.There are several restaurants within walking distance, however there are better options all within a quick 15 minute drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubuflu
50,Great Venue,"Good venue, easy underground parking($$), great sound and lots of places to eat within 1 block.Also next to the Museum of Death and across the street from the W Hotel.A lot of vagrants and 'tent' cities so beware and be careful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la123brat
50,Always a treat!,"The Pantages is a beautiful theater and anything you see here is going to be memorable. We recently saw the musical On Your Feet and it was quite delightful. The singing and acting were superb. As for the theater itself, it’s beautiful to look at with all its Art Deco architecture. The seats are also comfortable but the rows very narrow so if you are seated towards the center, it will be a challenge to get out. Therefore I’d recommend aisle seats if you can get them. We parked in a structure across the street for $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Delicious historic and impressive theatre,Husband and I went to see the exuberant and entertaining musical On Your Feet while holidaying in LA. The show was great and the theatre is fabulous - beautiful Art Deco architecture and very comfy seats. If it looks familiar it’s because part of the movie The Bodyguard was filmed here back in the 1990s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm442
50,On Your Feet!,"A must do if you can! This beautiful art deco theater was completed in 1930 and is absolutely stunning. I have been there many times, but I last went to take my family rot see On Your Feet ! the Gloria Estefan musical. It was FABULOUS! The theater offers various priced seating and we paid 85 bucks apiece for seats in the back middle of orchestra. I have also taken kids and had front balcony whioh is okay too. They have a bar, and a snack bar. You can buy parking for 10 bucks with your tickets which I always do- easy walking distance to theater- we went too the 1pm matinee and had to be out by 5. The theater is on Hollywood blvd, but if you want to walk around then you will have to move your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lascola
50,A Glorious Theater,"Visiting the Pantages Theater makes you feel like you've stepped back in time right into Hollywood's golden age. The architectural style of the theater is beautiful and the acoustics are perfect. We saw the musical, On Your Feet and it looked and sounded wonderful. I do have to say that there is a very noticeable lack of leg room. If you are tall, you may not be very comfortable. Despite that, visiting the Pantages is a special experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRO_13
50,"GET ""ON YOUR FEET"" AT THE PANTAGES THEATRE IN HOLLYWOOD!","The musical ON YOUR FEET which opened on Broadway on November 5, 2015 is now playing at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. I attended this show last night and had a fabulous time. If you want a heartfelt true story and evening of wonderful music and dancing this is the show to see. I especially liked that there no political statement or innuendos inserted into the dialogue. ON YOUR FEET just tells you a story. An incredible story about how two people (Gloria and Emilo Estefan) and their family created a sound and a music that would change the way people would perceive popular music.The Pantages is located on historic Hollywood Blvd, in Los Angeles and offers a wide variety of seating. What I like about this theatre is that there are really no bad seats. The balcony has a mild rake so for a show like ON YOUR FEET you will be able to see everything and enjoy the totality of the dancing. I sat in the sixth row of the orchestra last night and the show was amazing.One note, try to take an Uber to this theatre because the parking next door Argyle is now up to $20. If you don’t mind paying, it’s a great garage but they ask for the $20 up front for you to park there.If you want to go see ON YOUR FEET, you better hurry because the show closes there on July 29th!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankcW9981RU

It is not the first time we have seen a performance here and it will not be the last time. The theater is beautiful, the people that work there are friendly and helpful, and the performances I have seen have always been fantastic. There's plenty of public parking and places to eat near the theater. If you haven't seen a performance at the Pantages, I highly suggest visiting their website, checking out the variety of shows that are lined up, and purchasing tickets. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6458ZTsarat
50,Excellent theater experience!,"The Pantages is just one of those beautiful old theaters that they don’t make any more. Gorgeous Art Deco design. Add to that the quality of the productions - everything we have seen there has been impeccable, from Book of Mormon to Hamilton to Cinderella.

50,First visit - amazing theatre and school of rock was awesome,Visited as a family of 3 (2 adults and 1 very teen 12 year old). It was our first visit to Pantages (we are from UK).The theatre was beautiful - it is worth getting here early to enjoy looking around a little.We tried thought the refreshments were typically inflated for this type of establishment.We sat in row j on the mezzanine - these are perfect for those requiring a little extra leg room or wanting an unobstructed view. These seats were good value (£60 each) however remember the booking fee and tax is to be added on top of advertised prices. The only downside of these seats is that we were possibly a little further back from the stage than our “Middle Aged jet lagged eyes” would have preferred.If we were in the area again and a suitable show was on - we would definitely return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownspeeddog
10,Cinderella,"My wife and I have enjoyed several plays at the Pantages theater in Los Angeles. Our recent trip tonight was to see Cinderella.

I always have my 11 year old grandson with me, and the Will Call staff were so sweet to him.The show was great. The place is just so pretty and perfectly maintained.

40,My Experience,"The Pantages Theatre is pretty cool. Especially since it’s right in the middle of Hollywood. It’s also got the famous Walk of Fame (those iconic stars in the sidewalk with a lot of famous actors, actresses, musicians and others in them) right on its doorstep. But the theater itself is very ornate and very old. It’s amazing to see how much detail is put into the place and even more so since it was so long ago. Overall I had a pretty good time there and will come back here again if there is anything that I would want to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rekul42
40,Nice old place to see a touring show.,"Good place to catch the touring company of some Broadway show making the rounds. Architecture is old and very cool. Best thing is the Hollywood Blvd Location Location Location. Right next door is the Frolic Room, one of L.A.s best dive bars since the 1930s. Great for a preshow drink as the theater crowd gravitates to the fancier digs around. Best tip: As soon as the curtain goes down at intermission bolt outside as everyone is still clapping. You can be inside the Frolic Room already enjoying a drink when the theater exits to the street and people start wandering in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimo213
50,The Real Deal - Classic Hollywood theater with quality musical productions,"We have been season ticket holders at the Pantages for 7 years and have never reviewed this wonderful theater! This is an authentic classic Hollywood theater, restored in the '90s, which has great musical productions from the Broadway touring repetoire.I would suggest that any newcomers arrive early not only to beat traffic and get parking, but also to take a walk through the theater before the show. Look at the ornate lobby and staircases, go upstairs and look down on the lobby, look at the ceiling inside the theater, etc. All of that gilt and ornate stuff was restored to match the original.The shows are generally top-notch with a few lesser offerings now and then. Read reviews before purchasing tickets. The sound system is the only thing we have found to sometimes be lacking in clarity of speech for the actors. We always enjoy our trip to the theater.For those not used to Hollywood, be prepared for street musicians and homeless asking for money, random oddballs carrying unique signs or wearing unique clothes and hair, and just a whole lot of diverse people walking on the street in front of the theater. Some of the Hollywood Walk of Fame stars are right in front of the theater.There are many restaurants nearby, so check one of them out.We once did a matinee at the Pantages and an evening show at the Hollywood Bowl, with a stop at the Trader Joe's in Hollywood to buy our picnic dinner for the Bowl. That was a great day! Hollywood is interesting. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whenyoudream
40,Classic Theater!,"This is a classic theater! Some of the best plays and performers in the world have been performed on this stage. I've seen various plays/musicals here and I always appreciate the historical value of one of LA's most famous theaters.It is in Hollywood. Which if you are from out of town, just be warned that it may not be as clean and glamorous as TV makes it to be, BUT the city has been trying to clean things up and it is definitely improving and still a very important part in entertainment history so just enjoy it for that.This is a great spot to come with friends or take a date (perhaps not on a first or second..that might be doing too much). The interior has a classic vibe so you can get dressed up.Parking is pretty bad during plays, but that's part of LA.Overall, I would recommend this to a friend and would come back again to watch the next best play.I’m a fellow traveler and have always appreciated when people write about their experiences so I can make informed decisions.

40,Beautiful Art Deco Theater,"The Pantages Theater is a beautiful example of Art Deco architecture from that bygone era. When you go you are in awe of he carvings on the walls, the ceilings, the alcoves and even the mirrored bathrooms. They don’t build them like that anymore. Having said that, some how, some way they could have figured out how to include more stalls for the ladies room and not start flickering the lights after 10 minutes of intermission. At least 50 women were still in line and very upset.The production was amazing! So obviously modernity had reached the stage production. We saw “Love Never Dies” and it was surprisingly good. Orchestra seats with an outstanding view of the stage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kc2ahl

50,"A Vintage Classic, Gorgeous and Majestic","Visit older theaters and you'll find drab surroundings, no center aisle, small seats, and no attention to detail. Enter the Pantages and you'll discover a long lost world of 1930's Vaudeville, as you're inside a world created almost 90 years ago. Outdated? Sure. Tacky? Well, it's 1930s art-deco. It's not for everyone. Sit in your plush velvet seat and look up at the beautiful ceiling. Words here can't describe the beauty and detail you won't find anywhere else. Don't select balcony seats if you want to sit close enough to be near the stage. In the expansive, red-velvet lobby, you'll find 2 bathrooms for women, one for men and a full bar downstairs. There are other famous L.A. theaters I won't visit anymore because the seats are too small and there is no center aisle. And they look like warehouses on the inside. The Pantages is a feast for the eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/King_of_California
10,"I left at the intermission disappointed and sick — Old, bad smells, and Uncomfortable is an Understatement","My partner and I bought Saturday date night tickets to see Aladin in March 2018. The show itself was mesmerizing, and the set design was excellent. However, things immediately took a turn for the worst. And we choose to leave during the intermission because there was a rancid smell permeating the theater. I would have gone earlier but didn't want to be rude to the performers, but I was becoming physically ill-smelling it. The seating is so cramped that I could smell someone sitting in proximity to our seats and their rancid breath, it was indeed a terrible experience and expensive mistake.So there I was on Saturday night super excited to see Aladin. My partner and I arrive at the Pantages Theatre. (This was the first time I have ever been here, likely will be my last unless they remodel). Only to leave an hour later at intermission sick and disappointed because the theater smelled so bad.First thing I notice, this theatre is old and not in the charming, ""oh a piece of history old."" But old as in, ""oh this place is dilapidated."" When you walk in, there is a sizeable disorganized cluster of people waiting to get in, but overall experience getting in wasn't that bad.We had just eaten, so we didn't get any concessions besides water, which was moderately priced. We found our seats; we were in the orchestra row Y seat 211. As we sat down, I noticed the seat room in this theater was subpar. Now I will acknowledge that I am 5 foot 9 inches tall so about average to a little above average height for a woman and I was cramped. There was no room to move, and every time someone sitting next to us had to get their seat the whole row had to get up and stand. The lady sitting next to us remarked, ""Last time I was here I was pregnant, thank g*d I am not anymore."" TMI lady but okay.Then the show started, and the smell started to become more apparent. At first, I was convinced I must have had terrible breath, but that didn't make sense because the ebbs and flows of the smell did not correlate to my breath. Then I thought it was my boyfriend, but that made me wonder why I had never noticed in all our time together that he has rancid breath. So I whispered to my boyfriend to ask him if I had bad breath to which he whispered back, ""I thought it was me, I smell it too!""So moral to the story, you shouldn't have to sit so close to someone that you can smell their breath at the theater, or maybe the entire Pantages theater just smells like someone's bad breath. I'd recommend staying away for your own health.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652kimberk

50,A Must Stop in Los Angeles,"If you are traveling and get a chance you really should go to the Pantages to see a musical or anything they have on at the time. This place is just stunning. It is decorated as it was years ago when it opened. It is all Deco. It is the prettiest theater in Los Angeles.Our recent trip was to see Aladdin and it was great. The Pantages has affordable season passes as well as individual seating for just one show. They also have Black Friday specials that are great.All of the Orchestra seating is very good as is the front of the Mezzanine. The balcony in the back is not very good. They have great sound. Parking is right next door, for a fee, but all of Hollywood parking is fee based. It is in a very safe area of Hollywood and you can walk to a eatery or a decent bar before or after the show.The service is great. All the employees are helpful and you get you where you need to be. They have a wonderful concessions stand and a full bar. They need to add on an additional women's bathroom or make a unisex one because the line is crazy. The bathrooms are spotless.There is no elevator for the balcony so if you are handicapped this is not the area for you to sit. They have quite a few handicapped accessible seats in the orchestra.Get there on time, because the show starts on time, always.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

20,"Love the Pantages Theater, but giving poor rating...read why:","We enjoyed Hamilton and the Pantages is an absolutely stunning theater, however...the seats are crazy close together, making it impossible to pass to your seat if you are located inside the middle of the row. We tried twice, and it was a disaster both times, comes from both directions. Our seats were in the middle of the row.Pantages is an amazing theater, but there are not enough bathrooms. During intermission several get up and run to the restrooms. Both floors were lined up to use the women's restroom about 50 women long. Not an exaggeration. The line was out the bathroom, and up the stairs, and round the wall. We are young and agile, so we kept searching the bottom floor, and the top floor bathrooms and back again, hoping the line would lessen, but it didn't. The show was about to start, and the lights were flickering...we had to jump ship and head back to the seats, without going, because the show was starting. That's hard when it's dark, but worse when you have absolutely no room to walk past the other already seated patrons. You end up stomping on their feet, and falling in their lap. It was embarrassing and inconvenienced everyone. The theater is great except for these two real issues. I asked around and the historic nature of the theater prevents them from adding new bathrooms, but then...if you can't add more restrooms then make intermission longer, so everyone can go, and also please make the passageway between the chairs in the theater easier to navigate. Just our two cents...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
50,Truly spectacular theater,"I saw my first play at the Pantages ten or so years ago as a kid and was blown away, and every time I return I remember how much I love this theater. From Wicked to Book of Mormon to Hamilton I have never been disappointed by any experience there. I used to wait outside after a show and get signatures from the cast, which was wonderful. There is something energetic and happy about the whole place. It is a spectacular venue with such detailed architecture inside and out. The stage is majestic regardless of which set and play is being shown. The facility is well kept up and always clean. It is old so some spots on the floor have surprising steps and slopes, but the staff always warn you. The ushers are polite and the other staff are prompt. The only downside is the bathrooms: there is always a line out the door (worse for the women’s then men’s). Go before you arrive or run as intermission starts. Follow the theater policies and you’ll surely have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksgsbooks

Sound was excellent, including the live orchestra. We saw Hamilton, which was outstanding (touring company).A parking hint: we parked in a small lot (cash only) around the corner on Argyle, which is 1 block south of 101 freeway on ramps.

Walk carefully.Sound was good. Seating comfy. Little leg room -- my 6'6"" husband was miserable.But HAMILTON was grand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spoonball
50,You go for the shows,"As with any theater, you go for the shows more than you do the actual theater. But the theater is a very nice venue for a great shows. It is large the acoustics are great, and they always have great season",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msa23_2000
50,Hamilton at the Pantages,This show is even better than the Chicago presentation because of the cast. Voices are fantastic. This theatre has good sightlines and acoustics considering it’s an old movie palace. My friend told me the long line at intermission for the ladies room was well organized. There are several places to buy merchandise so don’t wait in the long line in the main lobby. Parking can be a problem so be early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindainLakewood
40,A Little Worn Down,"Hamilton was EVERYTHING anyone would hope it would be, but this grand dame of a theatre was a tad tired, but still worth going. For the prices we were paying, I would expect a better venue, but for the performance we enjoyed, I would have sat in a park on a cold towel. Venue is not everything, but that is what I am reviewing. I think they could reupholster the furniture more often as my seat was sagging a little, but that said, it was a dream come true to attend this spectacular performance and the dining selection nearby was quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatrinkaSD
50,"A Glamorous Hollywood (""legitimate"") Theater","The Pantages is a glamorous Hollywood ""legitimate"" theater (meaning live theater vs movies) near the famous corner of Hollywood & Vine. The lobby and showroom are spectacular. It is a medium-size theater, seating about 2000 people; even from row VV near the back, the stage was clearly visible and the acoustics were excellent. The seats are roomy and comfortable. The men's and lady's rooms were fair size, and at the interval they had staff directing traffic so well that everybody who needed them got to use them in time.There is ample parking costing $20 in the area, and there is also a Red Line stop at Hollywood & Vine. There are several restaurants within easy walking distance so you don't have to move your car; I can recommend Cleo (see review), open at 5:30PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00
50,Hamilton—Don’t Throw Away Your Shot!,"We saw Hamilton the day after Thanksgiving, at the 2 pm matinee. We sat in the back right orchestra. We had an unobstructed view, though it was a bit far. But 4 seats together were hard to find and I was unwilling to forfeit my son’s college tuition to get better seats. It was still very enjoyable!We parked at the corner of Hollywood and Vine for $20. It was a fenced lot with attendants—the Hamilton valet parking shares the lot. A 2 minute walk to the Pantages.Since LA traffic had been horrible (2 hrs vs. 45 min.) earlier in the week, we arrived early. We ate lunch at Hollywood Burger. The food was good and less than $10 a person. Great hot dogs, burgers, fries, shakes, and freedom Coke machine with free refills. Only about 3 actual tables (with plugs to recharge your devices) plus a long center table and long counter. No lines and quick service while we were there. Bright colors, fun place. Directly across from Pantages.We also walked down Hollywood Blvd. and looked at the stars, many of whom our teens didn’t recognize.The theater is full of old Hollywood glamour. Absolutely gorgeous. Seats are comfortable, and staff is helpful. The show was phenomenal. You may want to listen to the soundtrack before the show with your kids. “Who Was Alexander Hamilton?” ($5 Amazon) is a great pre-read. T-Shirts are $40. History truly is understandable in this show. I’d say 10 is a good minimum age. Language. Adult situation referenced. 2 3/4 hous.Don’t be late as latecomers are not seated during the show. Make a quick exit if you need an intermission bathroom break.We made a quick exit out the side curtain and beat the rush to Shake Shack. Almost identical burgers as Hollywood Burgers. $35 for 4 burgers, 1 fries, 4 small drinks (free refills). More tables than HB. Interestingly, tables are made from recycled bowling lane wood....very cool, modern vibe in restaurant. Both it and a Hollywood Burgers are super close to the theater and are a quick, reasonably priced meal for families. I’d rank them equally.Hope you get to see the show before it moves on!Please vote yes if this was helpful. The kids like seeing our votes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaryPlanner
50,Pantages - still a visual delight,"Saw Hamilton at the Pantages on Saturday night. It had been ages since we'd been there; still visually stunning and the acoustics are good. We were in the middle of the orchestra section - view of the stage was perfect. And of course the play was terrific.We parked at the W across the street for convenience. If you eat at Delphine before going across the street, the W will knock $5 off the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoWaves
50,"""HAMILTON"" MUSICAL","Saw the muscial ""HAMILTON"" for my 73rd birthday along with family members. Have attended the Pantages before but the musical was outstanding. The Pantages in the lower (orch) section is ok but the upper level (mezz) requires lots of steps. It is an old theatre but still beautiful. Tickets were expensive but love the musical. If you go, enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler811908
40,Very Hollywood-isque!,"Love the glamour of this Hollywood Iconic theater. This was the perfect intimate setting for the iconic play, Hamilton! The audio was crisp and clear. The seats were comfortable but the rows were a little too close together. (There were scratches on the back of the seats from shoes from crossed legs.) Parking was easy with a large garage on the adjacent street. Bonus, right on the Hollywood walk of the Stars. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Star is directly in front of the Theater. *heart*",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melia808
50,Loved the Pantages Theatre!!!,"Took my 18 year old niece there to see Hamilton for her birthday. It was a big success! I have never been to the Pantages before, and it was lovely. Lots of history there. Do NOT be late to the show. You need time to park, time to get in, time to buy a program or something, and time to get your seat! It was great going to the matinee. Would recommend it! We parked in the Columbia Records lot on Vine. $30 for all day parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benzslkgirl
40,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful old theater that brings great shows to LA.... Conformable seating, and decent leg room.... always a crap-shoot if you sit behind a tall person... but it is that way at most theater's. Bathrooms are a challenge (not as much for me as a man, but really tough for my wife at intermissions)......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markj4golf
50,Iconic Theater,We went here to see Hamilton and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. It’s a charming throw back to old time Hollywood. Acoustics were good. Just arrive early as parking is an issue. There is one lot just across Vine )theater is located at Hollywood and Vine) and if you arrive early enough you can park there and people watch or have a drink at one of the nearby bars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiAnnesInLove
40,Awesome experience,"We visited the Hollywood Pantages Theater to see Hamilton. We have our own great theaters in Seattle, but the trip to LA's was almost perfect. We stayed in Santa Monica so we could visit the beach as well. On the drive to the theater, we stopped at the Grove to shop a little, and we passed mounted police officers. For the show, we parked in a lot about a block away, which was $20. There were 2 adults and 4 children in our group. We arrived pretty early so we could avoid traffic, plus we didn't know exactly where we were going. We explored the Walk of Fame around the theater, and we ate dinner at Hollywood Burger, right across the street from the Pantages. The doors to the Theater opened an hour before he Show, and the doors to the seating area opened about a half hour before the show. The Theater was beautiful and clean. The souvenirs and programs were set up in good locations, and they had a variety of refreshments. Coca-Cola was $9, but it came in a souvenir cup. You could tell the Theater was old by the bathrooms, but they were clean, large enough, and everything worked well. For the show, they had booster seats for children as well as for adults! There was a booth where you could borrow opera glasses/binoculars or audio devices. Our seats were in the back row so we inquired about the glasses and the worker was honest and said we wouldn't be happy with them/they wouldn't be worth it because there's so much to see on stage. He was right. We didn't need them. We literally had the very back row, but we could see everything, just fine. It's a big theater, but it's not gigantic, so while we couldn't always see the actors faces perfectly, we could hear and see to our satisfaction. For Hamilton, I think you'd miss things if you sat too close. The ushers guard the doors and will only open them at certain times, once the show has started, so be punctual, or you will probably miss a lot. Attire was all over the board. Some people dressed to the hilt, some wore jeans. This is a very nice theater, and I'm glad we had the opportunity to see a show there. We'd do it again, in a heartbeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuziAAA
10,PANTAGES BOX OFFICE AND STAFF - WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO NASTY?,"The Pantages Theatre in Hollywood currently has playing the Tony award winning production of Hamilton which closes in December of 2017. I teach theatre at the University of Southern California and every semester students in my class attend live theatre productions throughout the city of Los Angeles. We attend a wide variety of theatres including the Center Theatre Group (Ahmanson Theatre, Mark Taper Forum and Kirk Douglas Theatre), Los Angeles Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Los Angeles Dance and the Geffen Theatre) I mention these other venues because the box office and patron staff at the Pantages stand out as among the worst and unprofessional. I attempted to drop off two “will call” tickets today and was told “we don’t do that… will call… unless you arrive on the day marked on the ticket and at least three hours before curtain time.” I replied: “Everybody does some form of will call to avoid trying to find someone in a crowd at the start of a show.” The Box Office Manger snapped back… “it’s because of Hamilton!” Really? Hamilton will be gone after December but the theatre going public in Los Angeles will still be here and why did you have to convey it in such a condescending and nasty way? The rudeness also extends to attending a show, you have to go through a roped in area (like a disco VP line) when you enter. It’s not welcoming… it’s mechanical and devoid of pleasantness. Most audiences are filled with excitement in anticipation of seeing a show. When you are met with this kind “boarder guard” mentality it’s a “buzz kill.” But you plow through and try to forget it… and not think that you paid sometimes several hundred dollars for a seat.If you are going to Los Angeles and want to see some of the wonderful theatre that this city offers, I highly recommend attending a play at the Center Theatre Group or Los Angeles Opera. It’s a fun place to visit, lots of restaurants nearby including Kendall’s Brasserie (French cuisine two-minute walk) which has the best wine list and great cheese plates, Pinot (California cuisine, which is right in front of the theatre and Patina (French, American cuisine also right in front of the theatres). In addition, Los Angeles Music Center which houses Disney Concert Hall, The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, The Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre is a work of art itself. It’s a great place to walk with beautiful artwork, gigantic theatre and opera banners floating in the breeze and gorgeous water features. And more importantly, the staff at all of these theatre make you feel welcome. They are polite and want you to have a great experience.As far as the Hollywood Pantages, I’d skip it. Unless, you want to be the target of a rude and abusive theatre staff. Right now, everyone wants to see Hamilton so they will put up with almost anything to get into to see this show. But, Hamilton is not forever… when it leaves to move to the next city on its tour, the hype of Hamilton will be over and the Pantages will return to its normal offerings of shows on tour. I think the management theatre, should take that time to retrain their staff and teach them that a little courtesy would go a long way in improving the audience experience. Or maybe they don’t care… and if they don’t they do so at their own peril… people might just stay away. If someone asks me why aren’t you taking your students to the Pantages? I’m going to borrow a phrase from their rude unprofessional box office manager “we don’t do that…”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankcW9981RU
50,Spectacular setting with a bit of history.,"Hamilton! The phenomenal Pantages theatre is perfect for Hamilton.The theater underwent a $10-million restoration and upgrade in 2000. When we walked into the lobby, we were in awe. In the lobby, two grand, carpeted staircases rise to either side below massive, Art Deco-styled chandeliers. The starburst ceiling pattern is repeated within the auditorium, but on a far grander style, backlit with deep blue hues that add further depth and dimension to its scale.The seating is comfortable. The views are amazing.I love that there are multiple aisles for easy access to rows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmeredith
50,Gorgeous oldschool decadent theater,I love being inside of this theater! You just look up and around the moment you sit down and you know you were in a special place.

The interior is stunning in its Art Deco design. We pre-purchased drinks for intermission, which was a wise move. I was knocked out by the excellent sound system, and the performance was even better than we imagined. Be prepared for the large crowd and long restroom lines. An experience we'll always remember!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/749elsag
50,Hollywood experience!,"I wanted to see a theatre show while I was in LA and chose 'Bodyguard - The Musical' at Pantages mostly because Pantages is famous and it's such an easy venue to get to in a great location (right opposite Hollywood & Vine Station). Hint: buy tickets at the box office, I booked tickets earlier that day & saved a fairly hefty online booking fee. The theatre itself is epic with red carpets & gold pillars, arches & sculptures stopping just short of kitsch (so Oscar, so Hollywood!) providing a true Tinseltown experience. With the Hollywood Walk of Fame right outside, why not make a day of it? Show prices are affordable even for big musicals and programs are free, unlike in my native Australia where you practically need to be part of the elite to afford the theatre!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7

Howard Hughes at one time owned the theater and had an office on the second floor.

40,Magical Journery to an Era of Romance,"Hamilton: After spending hours to get tickets and months of waiting, the day was here. From the moment we entered the theater doors we were transported to an era of romance. The theater is designed with elegance. Themes of architecture in the large are repeated about the theater. Chandeliers are magnificent. Acoustics throughout the theater are extraordinary.We spent the afternoon transported to another world in the glorious performance.As noted by another reviewer, the next improvement to the theater should be the seats. For an extended performance, their age and condition detracts from an otherwise magnificent experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Contribution2All
40,Beautiful theatre,"An absolutely gorgeous theatre. We were in row QQ on the first level for ""Hamilton"" and had a great view of the stage.The only downside was the lack of attentive ushers. There were quite a few folks in our section pulling out their phones during the show, and nobody came over to ask them to stop. During intermission, a few people notified the ushers (myself included), who said they'd keep an eye on the section, but Act II came...and there were more phones out during the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlee102
40,Beautiful Theatre to watch Hamilton,"We took a trip to LA to watch the touring Hamilton production. This is certainly a beautiful theatre that immerses you in that ""Broadway"" atmosphere. The sound quality was excellent. The performance was excellent, but of course that's more the production than the theatre.My only gripe is that the seats could benefit from an upgrade. About halfway through the show, I started to really feel those springs through the seat cushion. Not a bad review by any means. We enjoyed the show and the overall experience.Side note: We used the Eastown Parking garage across the street on Argyle. Pricey but super convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thedlr

Great visuals, but a bit rumbly sound. I LOVE the isle seats row B through M. LOVE THEM. We saw Hamilton twice in these seats and had a religious experience between the intimicay of the piece and the proximity to all that was going on.Take your best to impress.We also saw White Christmas there last year and took our 80 and 90 year old parents, they dressed up, and could hear all their favorite songs.

The entire theater is intricate, ornate and so interesting to absorb.Hamilton was a great production.Silly me, I did NOT realize the entire show was done in ""rap"" style music. This is a genre of music I do NOT enjoy, so the show did not have the appeal I expected from the hype it has generated.Unless you want to see a portrayal of our country's founding fathers ""rapping"", don't waste the exorbitant ticket prices to see Hamilton.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6335QSkareng

50,Hamilton in Hollywood!,"Went to see Hamilton recently at the Pantages and it was wonderful. The parking for the theater is a little sketchy though so we got dropped off and picked up by a friend. The neighborhood where the theater is located is slowly being improved but its still not a great neighborhood right now. There are plenty of paid places to park but they looked like they were crowded and hard to get in and out of. The theater is ornate and beautiful in a art deco motif. The play, of course, was fantastic. The theater served drinks in Hamilton keepsake cups too so that was a bonus. The seats are relatively small because this is an older theater but they are still comfortable and most seats offer great viewing. Would recommend seeing a show here anytime.

It was a weeknight and took us 1 hr to get here from mid-wilshire.We valet parked at the W Hotel across the street, very convenient ($20 with validation).Pantages looks beautiful inside, very art decor. Our seats were Orch Center row G and we had unobstructed view of the stage and we were close!The bathroom situation is not good. There are women's rooms on both sides of the theatre and upstairs but the lines were so long, the 15 mins intermission is not enough time for everyone to make it to the bathroom.The show is 2hr 45 mins, so plan your drinks accordingly or run out to the restrooms when intermission hits.When we got done, the line for valet was crazy to pickup.

Some of the shows were great (Phantom of the Opera, rent, etc.) and some were...meh (Titanic The Musical...yes, they made a musical out of it). Anyway, if you live in Southern California, you have to attend a show at this iconic theater at least once.Here are a couple of things I don't like about the venue.1. Location: Located right on Hollywood Blvd, the area is not exactly metropolitan. There are lots of traffic especially on the weekends. Beware when you are leaving late at night as it is not a very safe area. Parking can get expensive. I think we paid $20.00 to park a long block away.2. Theater: The theater's design and layout is outdated. It does not handle crowds well. The workers are no help. The crowd during intermission is crazy. The seats are old with very little leg room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jt99941

50,Vintage Hollywood Theatre,"The architecture of this Art Deco theatre is breathtaking. It is located at the Hollywood and Vine, the heart of Hollywood. The theatre's sound system at times makes it difficult to hear if you are in the back of the auditorium. If at all possible try to obtain tickets as far as front as possible and do not buy seats for the balcony because the theatre is so large it is quite difficult to view the performance.

Short line to pay at the machine after the show, but no lines getting out of the garage because there's 2 exits/entrances (Vine/Ivar).Ate dinner at 33 Taps, great food and service, but be aware they add a standard 19% gratuity. At least we got there before 6 to take advantage of happy hour discounts.Book of Mormon was excellent! Pantages is a beautiful venue with details everywhere to see, very well maintained classic and elegant architecture and super comfortable velvet seats. Doors open at 7pm, (no lines), they allow you to your seats 30 minutes before the show starts. Ladies restrooms on both sides of the theater and upstairs at Mezzanine level, so all lines go really fast.$4 coffees at the side bars, but for some reason $7 at the main bar in the center lobby.Great setup.

There were also very find special effects (which could have been a bit less louder). The production values and lighting effects were outstanding. The entire cast were stellar (including the dancers).A nice gentleman---- with an affable personality, in Orchestra, Seat M-311 had some humorous remarks that made for some funny moments. The Pantages has a decorum that reminds one of the ""glamour days"" of going to the theater and a night ""out on the town"" in Hollywood. The Pantages is a class act venue, which will always impress your guest(s). The art deco interior design is magnificent. One drawback, is that the city parking is ""ripping off"" the public, with parking at $30 - $40.00 per car. Such avarice and fiscal abuse of a theater-paying public, is unpardonable!!-----Bill Allen, Jr., (L.A., CA)P.S. with all of the GREAT TALENT, one could not leave the theater though, without thinking of our late, legendary, songstress ""angel"" Whitney!

Reset in the mezzanine three rules from the balcony excellent seats plenty of leg room was very happy with his venue. After the theater my wife and I had dinner at one of the local restaurants was a fantastic evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920johnnyv
10,DON'T buy season tickets,"I decided to get season tickets for the first time. The first 5 minutes they went on sale, I bought Orchestra seats. Three months later, I was given mezzanine seats. When I called, they said there were no orchestra seats left. I tried 3 other season ticket times, to no avail. Clearly, they overbook season tickets. Pantages is a theater, not an airline, there should be no overbooking. While I will ultimately receive a refund, this is not the experience anyone wants to have buying season tickets from an allegedly reputable business. If you think season tickets are guaranteed once you buy them, THEY ARE NOT. No way I will ever try getting season tickets here again.LikeShow more reactionsComment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattsZ3873MA
50,An American in Paris,Wow! What an amazing night out at this stunning theatre. We came here with a big group of dancers from all over the world to see 'An American in Paris' on its closing night. The inside of the building is just breathtaking & so beautifully detailed. We enjoyed a nice glass of champagne in the foyer bar before the show. The line up for the restroom was huge but I guess that can't be helped with so many people. I don't think there would be a single bad seat in the entire place & we loved the show. A special night out that I will never forget.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
50,Beautiful Art Deco theater,"The Pantages has wonderful plays and you can order seats online for whichever one you want to see. The theater is quite beautiful. We have sat in orchestra and mezzanine seats and you can see from almost all of them. They do ""not"" have an elevator and if you are sitting in mezzanine you must walk upstairs.Was there recently, parking has become a problem......be careful to ask how much the parking fare is. It ranges from $10-$30",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop

50,An American in Paris,"Many of us remember the 1951, Oscar winning movie ""An American In Paris"" with Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. It is now a fabulous musical play...A Tony Award winning musical.This production, currently at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, CA., is simply amazing. It has it all...great dancing, singing, set design. The sets were incredible, interesting, innovative, well designed and presented; many of the songs, authored by George Gershwin, are classics to which one could silently hum along; the sensational dancing ran the gambit from ballet to tap dancing, all so well performed and entertaining. I understand that this production will be moving on to Segerstrom Center in Costa Mesa in case your cannot make it during its current run at the Pantages. DON'T MISS IT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckeg2016

40,Lovely old theatre,"Got tickets on a whim on a solo trip. Staff were all friendly and atentive, and the interior of the theatre is lovely.

If you haven't seen a play here I would recommend it, you won't be disappointed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveLalaE
50,Historic Venue at its Finest,The Pantages theater is an historic movie house converted into a live theater venue. We recently attended Motown the Musical and were pleasantly surprised by the exceptional condition of the venue. The interior is beautifully maintained. We found the sound system to be very good despite having had some sound issues in the past. There is ample parking around the theater as well as great dining choices nearby. The theater is located to the east of the busiest parts of Hollywood Blvd. and very near to the freeway making for easy ingress and egress.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,Renovations Make this a must see,Very simple. The most beautiful of all the older grand theaters in Los Angeles. The renovations make this a must see for anyone coming to Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebMirror
50,Beautiful theatre,Saw Motown the Musical last night and truly enjoyed it. The sound system is excellent. The only negative is that the seats are not staggered enough so if you're a short person you might have a problem seeing the stage. I prefer sitting in the mezzanine. There is convenient parking just across the street where there is also a variety of restaurants. This is one of the original Hollywood theatres.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
50,Perhaps the Best Theater in the West!,"I saw a few shows here and must say that the sound and caliber of talent that has graced the stage of the Pantages was superb! Carole King's Beautiful, in particular, was excellent! The Pantages offers subscriptions and well worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
40,Beautiful architecture,I love this theater. We have been to multiple shows and they've all been great. The theater is in the style of old Hollywood and it's stunning. We've sat on the balcony and the floor and both had great views. The theater has a great mailing list that lets you know when shows are coming and when there are deals. We've gotten tickets for $29 with some of the deals. There is always a huge line for the bathroom for the ladies which is annoying but that's true most places. The metro line comes up right in front of the theater which is really convenient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishakelley
40,Broadway Comes to Hollywood,The Pantages is a beautiful old theater in art deco style. We have seen a number of Broadway touring companies here since we moved from NY as it seems to be the place where the national touring companies go when in LA. The theater is comfortable and located in Hollywood where there are lots of good restaurants to go to before the show or have a drink after the show. My only complaint is that the theater is really not configured for shows so much and the rear orchestra is quite far away from the stage-not as bad for large musicals as for plays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffn146
50,Incredible,I have been a fan of this theatre and the productions that it brings to Los Angeles for many years now it has allowed me to be a broadway show goer while staying in LA. I have seen 5 shows in this theatre and I'm not stopping any time soon.When purchased with spare time the tickets are as affordable as $35.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuzElenaR_13

40,Hollywood Landmark,The Pantages presents the best of Broadway in Hollywood. Last play I saw was The King and I. Only problem is the long lines in both women and men bathrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pompeyoc576
50,Best time to watch,"The theater alone exemplifies such vintage beauty. Before you are seated, grab some hot chocolate (they give it to you in a souvenirs cup) and be sure to look up to absorb the beautiful ceiling! Instagram worthy for sure!Don't buy the parking ticket online they charge an extra $2 for a convenience fee. There are multiple parking lots surrounding the theater that you pay cash for and are much closer.Try to get anything in the middle. Orchestra center or mezzanine center (try to get the first row) to get the best seat in the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krys_topher4
40,Beautiful Theatre,"The Pantages Theatre is an architectural masterpiece. While waiting for the show to start I found my eyes wandering around, and finding so many little details that can easily go overlooked. It's a very good venue to see a play or show as well, but as other reviewers have pointed out the seating could be a little more tiered. I found myself leaning to not have an obstructed view. Also not a big fan of the neighborhood. Can get a little seedy at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman
40,Beautiful,"They have a nice lineup of shows, and just gazing around the theater and it's amazing architecture is a show in itself. Seating could be better tiered as you can have limited view if you get someone tall in front of you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susieqa
50,Beautiful venue,I have come to this theater many times. Went this weekend for the musical The King and I. The production was great and I had the best view. I just love this theater.

50,Grand Theatre,An amazing location to view a performance. We were lucky enough to see White Christmas which is our favorite holiday movie. Well cared for and comfortable theatre. The actors were top notch. Not a bad seat in the house and the acoustics were great. Eager to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binkley007
50,A true landmark,The Pantages is a true Hollywood landmark (you've probably seen it in a zillion films) and attending any play/musical/etc there would be a great choice. Just seeing the inside is worth a trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RollMeAway
20,Outrageous Acustics,"Some of the shows presented here were good quality, but the sound system negates all the benefit. It is usually so loud you want to rip up your program and stuff it in your ears. Once they blasted the music so much that the sound system blew out and they had to halt the show for about twenty minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryk491
50,Iconic.,Go support live theater in this breathtaking and historic theater! You can't help but feel the old Hollywood vibes when you walk into this spectacular art deco bldg. It's pretty fabulous. They used to hold the Oscars here from 1949-59!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyCali74
50,Beautiful,"Have seen many shows and the Pantages...all of them top notch Broadway shows so they are, of course, amazing. However, seeing a show at the Pantages is extra special because the theater is so exquisitely beautiful on the inside. Savor the ceiling...it's stunning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Froggylyn
50,A Fun Place to Go For A Musical,We went to see The King and I. The theater is old and so beautiful. It's nice to just walk around and look at all the beautiful things in the building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78DONNAP78
50,"What a treat,,,,,,,","This theatre is so nostalgic it has an atmosphere all of its' own !I was there this afternoon for a matinee of ""The King and I"" the total production from The Lincoln Centre and it was wonderful.We had the understudy playing the King and 'oh brother' he was so good that he could be the lead at any time. What a voice and stage presence he has. The score is so memorable and the pit orchestra was magnificent, with a leader who was so enthusiastic he created a great vibe and supported the cast throughout. If you can get a ticket, do not hesitate, GO !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlebirdlondon46

50,Beautiful intimate theater,Beautiful intimate theater. Not a bad seat in the house. As with any older building the ladies restrooms are limited. I would recommend to the management to have staff assist with the flow of patrons through this area ( the Fox theater in Atlanta had the same problem for years but this year had employees directing patrons).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ishumoo

50,Historic Beautiful Theater,I have seen several shows at The Pantages. Always a wonderful outing. The theater is well designed. No matter which section my seats were located I could see the stage and acoustics always excellent. The theater is well run. Staff is courteous and helpful. I have tickets to 3 more shows this season and looking forward to seeing them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindysR5658SU
50,Beautiful art deco theater,"The theater is so beautiful! The women's restroom on the left side as you walk toward the stage is historic with lots of extra design detail. The one on the other side is not as crowded, but it is more simple. We have seen several shows over the last few years and every performance has been very well done. Just saw King and I. Excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naniksik

50,White Christmas !,This was the 5 th show I've seen at the pantages and it wax another rip roaring success ! The theatre is beautiful to look at and just the right size so wherever you sit you have a great seat ! Plenty of parking nearby and a Starbucks across the road ( no food or drink from outside can be taken into the theatre ) but you can buy drinks and snacks inside . Definitely try and go if your in town you won't be disappointed .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
50,Stunning Interior,"The reception by the ushers was wonderful. My wife is in a wheelchair and they were really helpful. Our seats were pretty good, I would have liked to sit a little closer, but we were happy where we were. It seemed like most of the seats were okay. When you get closer to the back its a little difficult to see. The intermission was good time, but the food and drinks are a little pricey and it's cash only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/horacem107
40,The King and I,Was able to purchase tickets as a present to see the King and I this past Wednesday at the Pantages. Parking available at several lots walking distance that range $14 to $20. We actually used the valet at the W Hotel ($20) which is directly across the street and convenient. Pass the security check outside brings you in to the lobby - two staircases to either side - detailed walls dressed in gold colors walks you through a different time as you make your way to your seats. Once in the theater - the grand tour continues with so much detail everywhere you look - theaters are not made like this anymore. My only complaint is that the seats sit all in line and are not staggered leaving some with a difficult view to see all of the stage. Plus the seats are too close to the next row - must stand to let patrons pass to seats down the aisle. Plenty of places to eat before or after the show. Traffic can be trying - be patient.The Show? IT WAS GREAT! I Highly Recommend the King and I! (3hrs),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seeker55
40,"Theatre gem with excellent, diverse shows","In the last few months, we have seen Willie Nelson, Charles Aznavour, Newsies, Cabaret, White Christmas...this is a go-to place for a wide range of shows, plays, performances in a magical art deco setting. Easy parking and nearby Cleo Hollywood is great place for pre-theatre dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billa651
50,Phantom of the Opera,We got great last minute seats at a great price. Secret tip: Go to the box officer in person. You will get better seats at a lower price. This is my favorite theater for this reason. The staff is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2345YBlynnc
40,White Christmas,"Went on a Friday night. Roads crowded and GPS gave us a short tour of the area. Side streets and all. Parking runs between $10 and $20 fairly close to the theater. Even with security it was very short wait to get in. We arrived about 40 minutes before curtain. The play (White Christmas) was very good bot Bing and Danny called in sick. Refreshments were a little expensive, $8 for a Pantages cup with hot chocolate. Most seats seem to be good locations. Personnel were very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8474WPterryb
50,The Only Show In Town,"I'm surprised that I never have reviewed this - been going for over 30 years. This is about the only place in town - the larger big town - that resembles Broadway. L.A. has never been known for its theatre venues, and despite new ones cropping up over the year, at any given time the choices are limited. But to point, this is a lovely theatre, just what a theatre should look like. Parking can be annoying...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorRetired
50,"Gorgeous Venue, and Very organized staff","I was at the Pantages last night to see Hedwig and the Angry Inch, my friends and I enjoyed the show, also the staff is really well organized in terms of checking your bags, tickets and helping you get to your seats, All that we encountered were friendly, customer oriented, professional, knowledgeable and we loved our experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/applepie2001
50,Rocking out at the Pantages,"Probably our favorite theatre in Southern California. It's simply stunning inside and worth the admission ticket just to explore its architecture and design. The shows aren't half bad either. This trip our tickets were for Jethro Tull, and though it was more a concert for my husband than myself it was still an overall excellent concert experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caltravler
40,Pantages and Hedwig both great,We attended Hedwig and the Angry Inch here the other night. Hedwig was great and the theatre was very comfortable. (I attend a lot of shows in New York City and many venues are very cramped and uncomfortable.) There were also ample amount of rest rooms which is a nice surprise. My only complaint is that Pantages is one of the very few theaters left in the country that still won't let you bring drinks in to your seats. This is a huge negative to show goers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3427FIwilliams
50,Broadway Shows in L.A.,"We love the Pantages Theatre. We subscribe! We just saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and are looking forward to Hamilton.If you've never been to the Pantages, you have missed out on something valuable in your life. Just go. Look around. The building is majestic, the interior ceilings are amazing. The performances are ALWAYS top drawer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halfordf
40,"""Old Hollywood""","I haven't been as bowled over by some of the performances at the Pantages but am always stunned by the surroundings. It is a beautiful theatre with all the grand opulence of days gone by in the best possible way. Some of the shows are outstanding, and rarely is there a dud. If you go, go for something you really want to see and get there early enough to experience the grandeur of the lobby. I find the ground floor seats to be excellent, even on the farthest left and right sides. Seats are often discounted on GoldStar for shows that are not sold out. People show up dressed way up and way down. They do a purse check upon entrance but are never rude or intrusive. Try not to spend money once you buy your ticket; refreshments are really expensive, even a bottle of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaLosAngelers
50,The Grand Old Pantages,"You can spend an hour just walking around the place to take in the architecture both inside the theatre and outside in the lobby areas. It is a classic. Has both a huge main floor and a balcony. Parking is not inexpensive, but a better way is to eventually get to the Metro Redline subway and get off at Hollywood and Vine. Subway exit is right across the street from the Pantages and next door to the ""W"" hotel/bar. Much easier than driving. I remember going here as a kid, when it was a movie theatre. Once you get inside, just imagine how large the screen was in those days...Have seen a number of plays put on there over the years. Sound is good, crowd is large, intermissions are a great time to people watch. Upstairs (mezzanine) is an alcohol serving bar as well as concessions on main floor. As always, playhouse prices prevail. Recommend planning a meal either before or after. There is an old dive bar next door, usually packed to the gills before a performance. If you get there early or can handle the crowded small space, go for it...kind of legendary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buzzy32655
50,Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"Incredible show, a lot of talent. Probably best to read up on it on Wikipedia prior to attending, then it makes more sense",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reggiej1
10,Pantages - Hedwig & The Angry Inch,"We're season ticket holders at the Pantages and very liberal about content. Ignore the fact that it is basically a one man show about a transsexual from Germany with very Bowie esqe attributes, especially the wigs.It's simply a very bad rock parody, with fair music and simply no plot or story line. My family, ranging from 29 to 60 with a strong love of the arts all voted it, unanimously 4 Thumbs Down !!!!! Just a bad use of a stage and it's an insult to plays to even call it a play!!It's a good thing it didn't have an intermission and sad that the bar was closed, I gladly would have finished the second half in the bar. My son got up to follow me and also discovered the bar closed.Bring the curtain down and bring on The King and I. Sooner than later would be excellent.If you are in Hollywood to see a play, save your hard earned money for something else💤💤💤💤💤🚯",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan

50,Dreamy Historic Theater in Hollywood,"We just sat Cat Stevens at the Pantages. We sat in the front fow of the mezzanine and had a great unobstructed view of the stage. The show was fantastic. Parking was nearby, drinks were expensive and the merchandise lines were almost as long as the rest room lines. Actually, it was a teriffic evening and at least the 2nd time we have been to this awesome theatre. Programming is generally very good, but expensive. Sometimes there are tours of the theatre, but I have not been on one in many years. I'm sure we'll be back at the Pantages some day; it is a nearly perfect venue for an intimate musical or theatre evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielml85
50,Fabulous Art Deco Theatre,This is a gorgeous art deco theatre. Really not a bad seat in the house. If you live in the area you can take the Metro red line to Hollywood and Vine and it's right across the street from the station. I love this theatre!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jet7777

40,Cool venue but bring your patience!,"An iconic and lovely large theatre in Los Angeles; with it, comes long lines -inside and out.Give yourself extra time and don't expect to use the restroom or bar reliably. We saw Cat Stevens/Cats Attic recently and the performance and staging were terrific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9551CVpamelam
50,Musical theater haven,"I've seen several musicals here, and just love the Pantages. It's beautiful inside with its historic Art Deco design. The theater itself is relatively large, but I've sat close and far from the stage, including the mezzanine, and I felt the same wonderful experience wherever I've sat. It is an old theater; however, so it isn't stadium seating. There isn't a lot of leg room between rows either. Though I wish that could be better, I accept it because it is an old theater after all. Also, be careful of the aisles. They have a STEEP incline. I have no idea why it's like that, but it's like that. The ushers warn you, but man, they are steep!Getting there: the Red Line train station is conveniently located just across the street, making this place even better because I don't have to worry about traffic and parking in crazy Hollywood. There are some restaurants and bars around the area, so arrive early before the show and enjoy happy hour food and drinks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee_C_2010
30,Nice for shows and okay for concerts.,"We have been to many shows here. Wicked, Phantom of the Opera, Lion King, Cats and enjoyed the performances. Cat Stevens concert was held here last night and it was nice, but not as nice as Nokia (MSN) was a couple years ago. The sound was okay, but the place is not meant for concerts that have a high ticket cost. The staff was very nice. The place is old ...built many years ago, so bathroom lines are crazy at the break and lines to buy memorabilia and T-shirts crazy. The lobby is so small and lots of steps. No food sold so we met someone that did not have dinner and he ate a big cookie and a brownie as that was his only option other than candy. Getting in was quick and parked at the lot a minute walk away ""6201 Hollywood Blvd."" which was good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalifSue

Of course sitting in the center is always first choice but if not available all seats are good and the sound system is first rate, Main lobby has food and drinks and collectibles to purchase. We sit always in the upper levels where a bar is also available..Well run with lots of people to direct you to your seat . Doors upstairs open 15 minutes prior to the show. Our venue was to start at 7:30 but did not start untit 8:00l due to the amount of traffic in Hollywood on a Friday night so don't get mental if your stuck in traffic, the show will not start on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandbear6

30,Broadway shows tour here. Seats are tiny.,"It's a lovely old theater in the heart of Hollywood where all the Broadway touring companies stop. I'd love to go here more often, but as a taller person, I literally do not fit in nearly every seat in the house. It's an incredible hassle to book aisle or front-row seats, and you usually can't do it online. So, as much as my daughter loves her theater shows, we don't go very much. Which is a shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betteryeti

40,Beautiful old theatre,"This theatre has a certain charm due to its historical significance and décor. It is not a ""fancy"" theater and it's not particularly well maintained. But, for a modest theater experience it serves its purpose. It is well located on Hollywood Blvd with ample eating choices in the area. Be aware there are not enough restrooms at this venue and the long gets very long during intermission.

50,lovely place,"I come here so often to watch musicals, I might as well live there. The staff working are always extremely friendly and the theater is beautiful as always. I love the musicals choices lined up every season and I always try to make it to Pantages to watch my favorite musicals. I just wish there were more restrooms available to the patrons, if not the intermissions should be a little longer. Everytime I try to use the restrooms during intermission, the line for the ladies room was so long I would see people turning away and deciding to hold it through the second act of the perfomance. Parking is also relatively difficult and traffic in Hollywood is always a pain. However, for matinee performances, it is helpful to use the metro since the station is directly across from the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katesc1996
40,Great Theater in Los Angeles,"Have been going to Pantages for over 30 years. A wonderful Hollywood building in Art Deco style. Most major productions appear here at some time or the other. Acoustics are good. Seating is nothing special. My only gripe about Pantages concern the women's restrooms which are woefully inadequate. The lines at intermission have crowd control barriers to try to organize the number if people waiting. You need to run to the bathroom to get back to your seat for the start of the performance. .The other gripe is the parking. There used to be two near by open parking lots which are no longer available and you now need to park in parking structures and cost is around $20, Also there are not a lot of places to eat once you have parked, so best to eat somewhere else first. In spite of all this, we still be going to the Pantages but will probably use the Metro Train in future which has a stop right across the street from Pantages. Great theater shows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukpatty
50,The Broadway of the West Coast!!!!,"I buy season tickets every year to the Pantages. Other than being one of the most beautiful historical buildings in Los Angeles, the Pantages brings in some of the most talented traveling theater troupes in the country.

It's such an enjpyable way to make memories and spend time together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opheliabright
40,"Stunning Theatre, Low Theatre Etiquette","The theatre is absolutely beautiful, you just can't help but be mesmerized by it. It feels historic and a bit like the old world. They always have the best shows in town and they're really good ones. I just didn't really like seeing people show up to the amazing shoe and theatre in shorts or jeans. It didn't feel entirely like real theatre as a result, as I'm used to a more upscale crowd of theatre goers.

We bought our tickets from the box office at around 2pm. There were still some decent seats left - but the house was almost full that evening.The performance was very enjoyable - great musical numbers.

40,Great theater and Excellent Performances,"The Pantages, one of Hollywood's historical cornerstones, is a must-see even if it's just to admire the well-preserved Vaudevillian design of the theater. The theater was renovated, but maintains the authentic style of the 1930s, the decade in which the theater was built. While the sound system is excellent and the seats are comfortable, there is very little leg room between the rows. If you tend to feel cramped in venues with tight seating, buying an aisle seat ticket might be a necessity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LinKo254
50,Best place in L.A. to see classic musicals,"We have been here dozens of times, taking our nieces and nephews to see touring companies' versions of classic musicals. The building itself is impressive and there are lots of great places to eat before the shows. (Our favorite is Delphine's right across the street.) One can purchase discounted tickets via Goldstar on-line or grab a season pass in advance for less $$ than single tickets. We always dress up and make a night of it but some people dress casually. One not great thing is that the parking lot across the street is under construction so parking right now is not fun - it's a bit of a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxskin

50,"The Carol King Musical, with friends","There were 5 couples and my wife and I who went to see The Carol King Musical at the Pantages Theatre. The show started at 8pm, so we decided to have dinner 1 block away at 6pm before going to the theatre. The parking was off Argyle Street, directly in back of the theatre.The traffic was slow at Hollywood and Vine and the sidewalks were crowded with many different people. Some in suits and dresses, some in tattered clothes and some in costumes. I think tourists could be a little disappointed in what they see as they walk up and down Hollywood Blvd. for the first time.When we got to the theatre, there were short lines because they were checking purses and other bags. This I really didn't mind, because it seemed very crowded at the theatre. I remember the theatre being big, but it looked very big to me this time, with a very high ceiling. Our seats were in rows V and W on the side and about 2/3 the distance from the stage. Virtually every seat was filled, so I estimate close to 1,000 people seeing the show. I'm glad my wife brought a small pair of binoculars, so we could occasionally see a close up of the singers. The seating was very good, I think all of us had a clear view of the stage.The musical was about her life when she got started in music at about age 15 or 16, over 50 years ago. I didn't realize the number of very popular songs she and her close friends had written that became hits, all recognizable, at least to me.The musical went along at a really good pace and kept our interest. There was one break, about 20 minutes or so. After the final song, the whole cast got a rousing, standing ovation, which I thought was well deserved.My thoughts are, if you enjoy musicals you'll enjoy this one. If you are over 50, you'll really enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FKI2014Sept
50,Beautiful Art Deco Theater; Wonderful Acoustics,"You'll more than likely have to pay for parking at a lot; street parking, while available is scarce.The Pantages Theater is located right on Hollywood Blvd near the corner of Argyle Avenue. Once you step into the theater, you're taken back to a theater of yesteryear. The theater is scrumptiously decorated in the Art Deco style with an elaborate grand lobby and wall decorations.We've enjoyed seeing shows at the Pantages over the years. This most recent time, we sat in row PP and while fairly far from the stage, the acoustics were clear and sight lines were still great. We brought binoculars for better views of the actors and set designs. Seats are comfortable but aisle space is tight.We were late to the show so were not admitted until an appropriate break. There is a screen where you can watch the show in progress while you wait. The ushers were polite and professional and showed us quickly to our seats.For those who are hearing challenged, closed captioning is provided at the far left of the stage (facing the stage).Restrooms are located downstairs to the right and also upstairs to the left for the ladies and lines are always long at intermission.

40,An Old Movie Palace offers visiting Musicals,"If you're in L.A. and want to see the road company of a musical, the best place is the Pantages. Lots of parking near Hollywood and Vine (moderately cheap) surrounds this Hollywood theatrical landmark. The place is huge and everything is heard through a sound system so it doesn't matter all that much how far back or how high you sit. The performances are always professional if not inspired and the price of a ticket certainly beats Broadway anytime.Ladies make sure to go to the lav before the show because the queue at intermission is ferocious! Men zip in and out (and up and down).There's also a secret VIP room for special occasions upon request.

We cannot say enough about the staff and how well they treated their guests. They were polite, knowledgeable, obviously well trained and gracious.

50,Beautiful - Carole King the Musical - Gorgeous Venue!,"Attending any event at the Pantages is a Wonderful experience, can't even remember how many shows we've attend over the years. It's a gorgeous theater, like stepping into ""Old Hollywood"".. a small venue where almost every seat is good. Haven't had a bad one yet. The only negative, as always is the horrid long line at intermission to use the ladies restroom....but don't see any way to remedy that? No Drinks, lol?!We enjoyed just seeing Carole King the Musical. Really weren't sure what to expect so it fulfilled our expectations and more. The songs/music Carole and her husband wrote are all amazing, and so many songs we didn't know they wrote.There were no slow moments, lively and funny, as well. the cast was fabulous, and the singing was awesome!A show we would attend again, made us love Carole King even more than before!Definitely - Beautiful and SO is the Pantages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyDi_and_Cowman

50,Great acoustics! easy parking.,"Such an ornate and historic theatre! Wow. If you are even a little handicapped, watch out because the orchestra seating walkway is quite steep. We saw 42nd street show, which was fantastic. By the time the 8:00 show gets out at 10:30 or so, I was glad we had parked in the Eastown parking garage directly across the street to the east on Hollywood Blvd. We got there early to see the sights, and paid a flat $18. We were able to get out quickly from the parking lot with no wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cr1717

40,Wonderful day at the Pantages!,"Went yesterday for 42nd street and had a great time. We used the valet at the W and then walked across the street. The staff were all friendly. Good service. The theater is pretty and great to take some pictures for your FB or TA posts. ;)The only area that I can think of that can be improved is that they need a few more ushers during seating. Several elderly people with canes or stability issues had a hard time navagating the slope. They do ask you at the door if you need help to your seat but this sweet old lady said no even though she obviously did need help. I helped her myself and she was relieved.It was a wonderful show, great theater and worth the cost. Highly recommend.TIP - bring cash for intermission treats/drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508aileena
50,Gorgeous Theater,"The interior of this theater is simply stunning. Walk in and look up, then at intermission, walk up to the stage, turn around, and take in the view. One caveat -- you are packed in pretty tight, so if leg room is an issue, make sure to get an aisle seat. Cocktails, water and snacks are available. For the ladies -- you must visit the ladies room, it is vintage Hollywood! Ticket prices are reasonable and the theater is relatively small, so you can sit in the back row of orchestra seating and still enjoy the show",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558bethm

50,A Theater Experience From the Golden Era of Film!,"I LOVE the Pantages Theater and absolutely recommend to everyone to see a film there at least once. It's more than just going to see a movie - it's an entire experience. If you splurge for the VIP tickets, which aren't really much more, it comes with a drink and popcorn and balcony seats. Shows open with one or two opening acts - when I went there was a comedic juggler and an organist.Just note that if you attend a late evening show, it will go really late into the night, at least an hour or so beyond the film itself, so make sure you're truly a night owl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chateaucrowley

50,Kinky Boots performace is fantastic!,"There can not be a more elegant yet comfortable place to see a live performance than the Pantages. It is like stepping back in time to a more elegant time when people took time to see the arts live rather than on a screen. The show Kinky Boots is one of the best performances I have ever seen. It was lively, funny, heart breaking and came back around to a good feel ending. The music and dancing unbelievable. Each and every character no matter how big or small the roll, amazing. The theater itself, clean, with great staff. I would highly recommend this to a visitor from out of state or the tourist and art lover in the locals! Bravo!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildnsoft
50,Great venue,"If you're lucky you get to see a concert here but they usually have plays and those are pretty amazing too. It's one of those historical landmarks in the heart of Hollywood so if you get a chance to go, I wouldn't pass it up. There is parking in the back or in surrounding streets. Make sure you give yourself enough time to park so I would show up at least 30 minutes early. If you want to eat, there are a lot of restaurants around either right on Hollywood or on Sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NilooG
40,Kinky Boots!,"This was a great musical, and I really loved it. It was fast paced, and there were plenty of times where my feet were tapping. Pantages has no parking, you have to park down the street. They also do not allow alcohol in the theater, so instead you can buy a $7 soda! Most seats are good, but really anything below Z is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AustinS713
50,Just Like Broadway,"We recently saw ""Kinky Boots"" at the Pantages. We have lived in Southern Cal for many years and it was our first visit to the theater. We were not disappointed. The theater reminds me of a Broadway theater. Not too large, excellent sound, and easy access. Located on Hollywood Blvd. near Vine. There are several ways to get there, car (and there is paid parking in the area), but I suggest try taking the metro. It is easy and inexpensive. The theater is ""kid"" friendly, but depending on the performance, it may not be advisable. I don't feel ""Kinky Boots"" can be understood by pre teens. If another show comes that we would like to see, we will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BestCoastTraveler

40,"Historic theater, dodgy sound","The theater presents popular musicals like Kinky Boots and the Lion King. It is beautiful with lots of gold molding and decorations.

40,The show selections are always great.,"The parking has gotten really bad. You have to walk through a very bad area to get to your car--hopefully that will change. there are bad seats here, but the experience is super enjoyable if you get a good seat.

We watched the Illusionists, it was a very nice show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaTVC
40,The place for Musical Theater,"The Pantages has cast itself as ""the"" venue for many touring companies for Broadway shows. Productions are usually quite good. Prices are not too over the top, but the theater is cavernous, far bigger than any Broadway theater so do not expect intimacy. Purchasing tickets is relatively easy. Parking is not fun - it's Hollywood, it's Los Angeles so what do you do. There is a subway stop by the theater, good for getting there but can be unpredictable and a little sketchy after the show. Not my favorite venue, would rather go to the music center, but this is the only place to catch many shows coming to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRwestla
50,Fantastic Restoration; Great Shows,"We've been here many many times. Lots of Broadway musicals and other shows come through here. Almost never disappointed.

40,"beautiful, historic theatre",Recently saw the Illusionists at the Pantages. Great show in a great theater.Only a few historic theaters from the pre-depression era still around to enjoy.

Although I had some difficulty booking my accessible seating, once I arrived at the theatre, the staff could not have been more helpful, and the seat was well-positioned, with a good view of the stage although I was on the far left.

The lady in front of me thought it was an Abba concert so she stood and danced alot, so I leaned a little closer to my wife of 29 years which was great.My only complaint was that at intermisiion the smokers stood right outside the front door and all the smoke filled the lobby. There was a haze in the air and my pink lungs probably got a lottle darker.Still a great night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylebistline
50,Bullets is a winner!,"We always love seeing shows here as the venue is a classic theater and there are really no bad seats. Plus the trip here and the parking for Valley residents like us is relatively painless even on a Saturday night. Bullets over Broadway was amazing, especially the dancing. Simply outstanding choreography and dance performances! The rest of the show was predictable but lots of fun. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978iral
50,New York-Style Theatre In LA,"I love The Pantages. Having lived in New York for 23 years, I miss it like crazy. But when I walk into this theatre, I feel just like I'm back home in New York. The soaring, painted ceilings, the festooned staircases, the velvet...and that beautiful stage!I last saw ""Bullets Over Broadway"" there and the caliber of the production was excellent!I read that ""Hamilton"" is coming soon to The Pantages, and it might be a good way to try to get a ticket to this red-hot show if you just can't get one in New York.I like that there's a bunch of good restaurants so close to the theatre so meeting at one of these for a drink before or after the show is very easy.If you're coming to L.A., put The Pantages on your list of things to do, and catch a New-York quality show without having to catch a subway to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahhow
50,Bullets Over Broadway,"I was a little reticent about seeing the show after reading a poor critical review in the Times. A musical derived from the Woody Allen movie turned out to be great night out. The star of the show though was the theatre itself. Built in the 1930s at a time when dozens of theatres were built across LA, to feed the churn of movies coming out of Hollywood, they apparently drew customers with grander and more opulent designs. The place is simply astonishing inside and clearly a fortune has been expended on restoration. I'd definitely go again - whatever the show. (Mama Mia next - then Dirty Dancing).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47

This historical theater has a lot of history and is just beautiful. I hope it remains for many years to come. My only problem I have with the theater is, they do not validate parking. Parking last night was $15. At least when I go to the El Capitan I can get it validated there and it's much less usually it will only cost me between $5 and $8 My advice...

30,Great art deco theatre,The building is quite spectacular in its art deco style. The theatre is spacious and comfortable. Seating is good but not designed to eliminate the 'tall person in front blocking the view' that I think most other theatres I have visited have addressed appropriately.

50,I love this theater!,"I fell in love with the Pantages when I came to see a production of Les Miserables in the 1980s. If you are a fan of Art Deco, the architecture will blow your mind. The lobby and house are absolutely stunning. It's too bad they don't do tours--they'd make a bundle!Parking can be an issue. Don't count on street parking. There are parking lots across the street from and behind the theater. You can also get there by Metro: take the Red Line to the Hollywood and Vine station.The shows are pricey--Theatre usually is pricey--but the shows are top-notch. There are some sight-line issues, but you may be able to talk to someone at the box office in order to avoid these spots. One thing that galls me is the ""historic restoration fee"" the theater tacks on to the price of all their tickets. Don't make your customers pay for your renovation project for the next twenty years, Guys!If you're in Hollywood, this is one theater you must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DN5572
40,A Legendary Theater with the best and worst of history,"Let's start with the good. The Pantages is an absolutely stunning theater from the Golden Age of Hollywood that has seen some of the biggest legends of the past 100 years grace its stage. It's centrally located in Hollywood along the walk of fame, and hosts some of the best musicals to tour through LA. The not so good. Parking can be tough, as the Pantages doesn't have its own lot and you have to use neighborhood lots of varying quality. The theater is old, and therefore short on bathrooms. The lines for the ladies room can be epic. It also has notoriously bad sight-lines -- many of the seats on the wings, especially closer to the front, can't see the full stage. Balcony seats can also cut off the view of the top of the stage in certain productions. All in all though, the Pantages is a great venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanM1234567
50,Worth a Trip Even Without a Show,"What a great legendary theater should look like in the lobby, the stair cases, the theater itself.Been there for Broadway road shows and lately for Seinfeld. It works at every level--a spectacular song and dance extravaganza and one comedian on his own and holding the stage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeniVidiFrui
50,Great theatre with classic Hollywood feel,"This is my favorite theatre to watch musicals and plays in Los Angeles. The place sits in the heart of Hollywood, so you are always in the middle of the touristy mix. As you walk from the parking lot you’re able to see parts of The Hollywood Walk of Fame. The theatre itself is nice and has a lot of character to it. Gives you the old world Hollywood feel. For intermission, they have several different areas for drinks only and the main area is set up for multiple items. The restrooms are set up nice and have a powder room area so not everyone has to be congested in the area where people are waiting in line for a stall.The sound at the Pantages is always excellent. It’s a nice size theater so when sitting in the orchestra level try for single letter seats. When you get to AA and further back you feel a little far but you can still see and enjoy the show. It’s of course nicer to be closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowbuxlux

30,Classic theatre but not best place to see musical.,"The Pantages is a large venue mostly for traveling musicals. It is almost worth going to just to see the classic interior. It was originally one of the original classic movie theatres that has been restored to perfection. That said it is very large and there are some poor sight lines. If you get stuck behind someone a little taller than you it is difficult to see. Also the sound is hit and miss. With some shows its good and with some its either too loud, too soft or not very clear. Still if you want to see the show playing there - go and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446

I am always impressed by the high quality of service, the beauty of the architecture and the booming sound system at this theater. I was especially impressed this time by the amazing views in the upstairs level and the fantastic visual displays of the performance. I highly recommend grabbing a taxi or uber to the theatre. It makes the whole experience very convenient. The concessions are ridiculously expensive though. I will never pay $12 for a 8 oz cup of tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drksyders

Not from me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugLongBeach
50,Excellent Musicals and Plays,"The Pantages is a landmark in Hollywood and a must visit if you have time when in town. The theater is beautiful, with comfortable seating and friendly staff. Ticket prices start at about $40.00 for the back and go up to about $300 for the first 5 rows. Most seats are great. The far sides in the back are not the best and the back of the balcony is not good. There is no elevator so if you are disabled you will need seats on the floor. Get there early because parking is a bear.

40,Now This is a Theater!!,"Like all venues that host plays, musicals, and other live performances, the closer you sit to the stage the more enjoyable the experience. Some however, like Radio City Music Hall, are so vast that even an orchestra seat seems miles away and one cannot see the expressions or nuances that make live theater so exhilarating. Not so here. The Pantages is small and intimate, and one can see the performers on stage very well from any seat in the house. The art deco design and architecture will have you lifting your head and turning around to take in the wonders of that age and the beauty of this theater.

Over the years, parking has become diabolical; in the old days, that end of Hollywood was run-down and you more in danger of being mugged than being stampeded/run over by tourists. IN the past 5 years or so - that area is now built-up and you pay a price for parking and it's so different, but YOU will be going for the show and there are a ton of eating places now safely within walking distance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806

The sound/lighting quality is always top-notch, and the selection of shows (mostly big Broadway musicals) is timely and well-considered.The interior of the theatre has been lovingly & meticulously restored to its historic splendor, so it's a real architectural & art deco treat to explore before the show, too!Parking mostly consists of pay lots within steps of the theatre, and the rates are fairly reasonable (well, for Los Angeles, anyway).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb

That said, if you are lucky enough to have a short person in front of you - you will enjoy the experience. If you aren't so lucky, you'll probably have to consult a chiropractor to reset your neck as this theater has it's challenges. They get all the great shows though! So that's a plus!

Sometimes they offer special prices when it is a performance with stars missing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
50,Phantom of the Opera,"This was my first time seeing this stage play and also the first in this beautiful Theatre. We went to a matinee, the tickets were extremely reasonable but the show was unbelievable. The only stop was intermission, the rest of the acts were separated by a revolving stage change and smoothly transitioned from one to the other seamlessly and with purpose. There was a parking lot right across the street for $10 which make it a hassle free afternoon. We were able to buy tickets online about 2 hours before showtime. If one shows sold out, try another site. I don't think there was a bad seat in the house so just take what you are offered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneeBittner
50,Fantastic theater,First time here to see the Phantom of the opera and it's a very nice experience. We sit at the front just near to the orchestra area. Second time sit on on the second floor watch the The Wicked. I had great time and enjoy the whole show. Recently just saw The Book of Mormon it's just gets better and better. Parking is pretty expensive and don't park on the market to save money. My friend trying to do that and just got her car tow away. After the show is over there is also a long line to wait pick up your car too.Other than that everything is awesome!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venusblue64

If you are in Los Angeles for a visit, try to see a show here and check out the interior of the building. They don’t build them like this one anymore. If you’re on a budget, you can check out Goldstar which often has discounted tickets for this theater. For a few of their shows, Pantages has a lottery like they do in New York.

The acoustics are fine and the theater itself is ornate and very beautiful. All in all ithe perfect place to see A first-rate production of a wonderful musical.

40,Great Seats Almost Everywhere,"I saw Cameron Mackintosh’s travelling production of Phantom at the Pantages. By the time we decided to see the show the only seats were the ones far back, so we chose the lower-level seats under the balcony. I don't recommend that. The chandelier is actually obscured by the balcony from the last few lower-level rows. Otherwise it seemed that there were great seats almost everywhere. The venue is spectacular and well deserving of its reputation in the LA area. The sound was fantastic.As to the show, it was an ingenious set, and the cast was very good. I thought Chris Mann's voice had more of a pop edge compared to some of the other performers with more Broadway-type experience, but the audience seemed to be crazy about him, and he got a well deserved standing-O. I highly recommend seeing this production or any other at the Pantages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmpdsc

30,Historic theater in the midst of a packed area,"As a self-aware theater nerd, I was excited to finally see a show at the Pantages once I moved closer to the area. I had heard that the theater itself was beautiful, so I had high expectations.Coming from South Orange County, I factored in an hour and a half of pure travel time...this was for a Sunday matinee. If you're traveling north, expect major, major congestion, especially along the 101. I'm generally paranoid about being late for shows or movies, so I was relieved when we finally pulled into the lot 15 minutes prior to showtime.I wasn't able to really explore the area. It may be a little seedy at night...day time wasn't really a concern since the lot I paid for (through Ticketmaster) is just a crosswalk away, and there's hordes of theatergoers heading that way anyway.The interesting thing about the theater is that the lobby is small. Standing from the box office, you can see right into the theater, which is different from others like the Orpheum or Curran up north. I didn't get that same ""theater feel"" of leaving the street and heading in for the experience.There is a snack bar, but heaven knows this isn't the best idea. Nothing like hearing the sound of people unwrapping red vines throughout a show. They also serve drinks, but I didn't feel like waiting in line. If you do want to explore the theater or snag some pics (not of the stage of course) factor that time in. Same theater rules apply...use the restroom beforehand, try to avoid going at intermission, etc.**Since I was unfamiliar with the area, I went ahead and bought the Argyle lot parking from Ticketmaster. They do charge about $2 more than they do with the cash payment. I wouldn't advise you to prepay. The lot was full about 15 minutes before showtime, and I doubt they really regulate how many pre-paid tickets there are. The plus side is that it's a non-stacked lot, and right across from the theater in an open lot. If you're a planner, I'm sure you can find some cheaper parking in the area though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLadyJess

They asked many questions about decorations, sets, when it was built, whats this, whats that an on and on. Most of us are there for the play and never really see the beauty of the theatre.

You have to go a little early so you can enjoy the architecture and the magnificent decor. The ceilings , the stairs, the walls, the lights, the statues and the pillars, its all just fantastic. Then the play or the musical is just a plus. We have been there many times and we discover something new each time. Don't forget the tile mosaic at the end of the halls. There are plenty of exciting places out side before the event or after. The under ground Train is just across the street, and we prefer to always take it, as parking could be difficult and expensive at times, if not all the time that there is an event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684
40,Enjoyed my time,Just saw Phantom at the Pantages. Seat Z206. Inexpensive but still a great view. The old (restored) architecture in the Pantages is amazing. I loved just walking around and looking at the walls and ceilings before it started.The only downside I can think of is the bathrooms. There are two for men and two for women. Let's just say many women didn't make it back in time for the start of the second half (after intermission) because the lines were so long. They really do have to fix that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tb004

I've had the wonderful opportunity to see shows at the Pantages for over 37 years, and it's always a great evening. The theater, originally built in the 30's is still spectacular and it's fun to just look around at all the details. This theater showed movies in the past as well as hosted the Academy Awards for a decade. National touring productions are always playing and the staging is always great, probably helped out by the renovations done back in the 70's. We have great live theatre venues in the Southern California area, but to see a production at The Pantages is simply the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubuflu

Any show here is special and arranged that most seats have a good view.As many have said, bathrooms are limited and with the amount of patrons, lines form. Go before the show or intermission or if there is a second act go, while the orchestra is performing the reprise.

40,NICE THEATER BUT..............,"My wife and I went to a musical (Motown) at the Pantages recently. My wife has been here many times with her mother and overall we like the location. The only negatives are that the entrances into the theater from the lobby are not well marked and the staff do not always seem to know where the seats you are asking about are located. Also, some of the seats are not very comfortable making for a long experience with your behind going numb. There are also insufficient bathroom facilities for the large crowds that come to the shows. Finally, the large parking lot for this location (southeast of the actual theater) is chaotic at best with little to no help in getting your car parked and poorly marked parking places. If you show up early to deal with the parking and crowds you should enjoy this historic theater with its unique décor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevencH4861VJ
30,PANTAGES SEATS TO AVOID - UPDATE!,"“PANTAGES SEATS TO AVOID!”UPDATED REVIEW:The very wide Pantages stage presents many sight line issues for most national tours which are designed AND STAGED for less wide prosceniums -- and much less wide auditoriums.CANNOT recommend paying full price for seats in the FAR LEFT or FAR RIGHT ORCHESTRA SECTIONS. Or for ANY sections of the REAR ORCHESTRA.Once you're past row Z in the ORCHESTRA -- you're just too far away from the stage to feel a part of the live performance. And if you're considering purchasing seats in any of the ORCHESTRA double lettered rows (from Row NN to Row ZZ) -- you are really FAR AWAY from the stage.If you cannot purchase orchestra seats in rows A thru Z, then I'd recommend purchasing any seats in the FRONT MEZZANINE -- except for ROW A in the FRONT MEZZANINE because there is NO LEG ROOM in ROW A of the FRONT MEZZANINE. None. Anyone over 5'5'' will be in pain throughout the show as their knees will be pressed up against the hard balcony railing. (I'm NOT KIDDING.) However, everything from the FRONT MEZZANINE's ROW B thru ROW H is a very good seat.And ANY MEZZANINE SEAT (FRONT or REAR MEZZANINE) is better than REAR ORCHESTRA past ROW Z. At least up in the FRONT or REAR MEZZANINE you'll see and hear the show much better than you will in the back of the main floor seating.Also try GOLDSTAR EVENTS to purchase DISCOUNTED seats to most productions. You'll save a little money and won't be paying full price for limited view or far away seating.Alas, our glorious Pantages Theater was not designed for the intimacy of live theater. It's a big ornate cavern that devours a show if you're not seated front, relatively center or in the front mezzanine.(And no matter how close you think your seats are, BRING YOUR BINOCULARS because you're still far away at the Pantages.) And bring your camera to take pictures of the lobby -- it's post Depression era Hollywood decadence in its prime!Hope this helps you get the most for your ticket purchasing dollar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CEMILIOB

We love the old world style of the completely refurbished theater. It has charm overload. There are many places to eat nearby and also parking is not an issue. The only real issues are the concession stand and the restroom facilities. The people at the concession stands are rude many of the time. They didn't want to accept our credit card and only wanted cash even when we just saw them accept a credit card from the person in front of us. We had to get rude back and I don't like doing that.

We found parking was a breeze because we looked for a lot that doesn't stack cars. We also arrived early and walked around Hollywood and found many places to eat a casual meal beforehand. It's an old theater, so as others have said, the rows are quite close together. This was a bit uncomfortable for my husband (6'5"") and son (6'4""), but acceptable for my daughter (6') and me (5'8""). Having read so many comments complaining about sitting behind tall people, we ordered seats in the last row of the orchestra.

The top seats are set so steep, that when people move their heads, your view is blocked. It is a BEAUTIFUL theatre, the ceiling is gorgeous. It handles the crowd fairly well.

40,Absolutely Gorgeous Theatre,"We were surprised to get day of tickets for the musical Motown. The tickets were in the Mezzanine section. The seats were nice, but depending on where the cast was standing on the stage, I needed to move my head to see. The quality of sound was good for most parts. The acting was not all stellar, and that's why there was not a standing ovation. Overall a Musical worth seeing a lot of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
40,Beautiful Theatre and venue for musicals,"We have been there several times to see plays and recently went to see Wicked for a 2nd time.

Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vee1050

40,"Beautiful Theater, Great Shows, Sketchy Neighborhood","I love going to the Pantages for traveling broadway shows. I've seen 20+ shows and I became very familiar with the neighborhood. If you want to do the $10 parking and you leave during the first curtain call, then you can save 45 minutes of exit traffic by leaving the parking lot and going directly on the 101. The theater is so beautiful and kept very nice. The beverages are good and there's a full bar. The bathrooms are ALWAYS crowded during intermission, so go before or after the show if possible. In the neighborhood around the theater, I've seen prostitutes getting arrested, a guy pull a knife on someone and even my Deputy Sheriff friend won't tell her husband when we walk from the theater to the Pig and Whistle for dinner because the neighborhood is so sketchy. The Wood and Vine is right across the street and really the best option for before the show. If you have time and want to park TWICE without walking the bad neighborhood, then Miceli's is the place to go right up the street. I go here over and over and there's not really a bad seat, even though I prefer orchestra seating. For the best prices on shows, I subscribe to the theater's website as well as travelzoo, goldstar and groupon, so I rarely pay full price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieRKay
40,See A Broadway Play In A Beautiful Venue In Hollywood,Had a great time! Saw the Broadway Play 'Motown' in the beautiful Pantages Theater! I've been there before. Always a joy. Take some time while you're in town to visit this vintage venue. Not a bad seat in the place! They could do with more restrooms for ladies but I've always enjoyed the evening. Even families with elderly members in wheelchairs were there! Parked on a lot on Ivar which is only a few blocks away. Parking is limited. Live entertainment is such a treat!

50,"""Beautiful Venue""","Visited the Pantages Theater recently for a matinee performance of ""Motown the Musical"". The play was outstanding, I recommend it highly!! Had not been in the Pantages for many years. It has definitely stood the test of time. The theater is beautiful with great acoustics and lovely architectural features .A few caveats, getting to the ladies room required navigating about 5 or 6 steps, which could be a problem for those with mobility issues. Parking is available for about $10, but get there early. We were rerunning a bit late, and the nearby $10 lots were full,. Wound up paying $15 for valet parking across the street, which was still pretty reasonable..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639cherylp
40,Motown,"Motown musical was great. Parking is easy at the Pantages, a lot right across the street. Cost was 10.00. There are several restaurants within walking distance.

40,"Pantages a lovely, classic theater","The theater is architecturally lovely. It is a great throw back to an era in Hollywood when glamour was key. It is a glamorous place to see a show.Unfortunately, they pretty much only book nationally touring musicals, so there isn't a lot of variety in what is shown. The only other down side is the lines for the rest room and the bars during intermission can be long and unwieldy. If you want a cocktail and to hit the restroom during the break, you will need to wolf down that cocktail, as drinks are not allowed back in the theater.But if a musical plays here you want to see, definitely go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683stevenb

50,The Low Down on the Pantages,"So, I've visited the Pantages several times, but not recently. I was taking my mom (who is, well, aging) and wanted some info that, no matter how much I checked, couldn't find. So, here's the nitty gritty. Parking: I was tempted to pay early online for parking because walking is tough for her, I already know parking in Hollywood is hit or miss/cheap and expensive, and wanted to be sure I had close parking without having to turn in my firstborn. Risked it and parked in the Sunshine lot diagonally located from the theater. It was $10 for the Sun eve show, open air, NO stacking (I hate that!!), and an easy walk to the theater entrance. No handicapped parking here though! We were an hour early, so it was no problem. Leaving was easy too because, by the time we returned, most everyone was gone. Something else to know about parking is that you can park at a metered spot on the street, with a handicap placard showing VERY WELL, without using the meter for a longer period of time than what is normally allowed. I always take a picture of the placard showing so it is time-stamped (I do this anytime I use a handicap placard for metered parking because Laguna Beach is notorious for ignoring this CA DMV rule and they just suck in general so now I'm trained like a dog). Entering the theater: We wanted to be early, have a cocktail (me!)/soda (her), take in the grandness of the theater, restroom, etc. I couldn't find this, but the theater allowed entrance to the lobby about 45 minutes before the show began and then allowed theater entrance about 15 minutes before the show. 45 minutes was plenty to grab a soda (main floor), a cocktail (down a level), use the restroom, and find our seats. The theater allows anything purchased at the main level snack bar to enter the theater (water, covered coffee/soda, snacks). Expect more than typical movie theater prices. Two waters=$8. Coffee and Red Vines=$12. Cocktails cannot go in the theater. A champagne=$9. I think beer was $7, cocktails=$11. There are very few places to sit and enjoy that cocktail, so be prepared for standing. I'd read that the concessions were cash only, but they all had credit card machines. Restrooms for women are small and slow, so hustle it at the beginning of intermission and make it happen. There is a ""secret"" one person handicapped bathroom at the edge of the theater and, if nobody is waiting, they'll let you in but don't be ""that guy"" and bug to use it when others clearly can't walk. We were late in buying our tickets and pretty much all of the good seats were gone. We ended up in a far edge section, all the way near the wall. Although it would seem these seats would royally suck, they didn't. Except for a few two or three times, we were able to see the entire show and hear it perfectly. Once in awhile, the edge curtains would block something, but it was only a few seconds a few times. The seats are old and uncomfortable and people with back/sciatic pain will probably be uncomfortable. At tip from the person sitting in front of me was that, if you are IN A WHEELCHAIR, you can have the handicapped seats for $25 each. Considering I paid more to sit behind them, it is a good tip to know. She said call the theater directly to arrange. Lastly, this is Hollywood, people. Every weirdo in town will probably bug you if you look at them. Get good at dropping your head and acting like you don't speak English and you'll be fine. Don't let your senior citizen engage them or you'll be in for a real ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224DeborahM
50,A Gorgeous Theater that Rivals the Best in Europe!,"A friend invited me to see Motown at the Pantages. I hadn't been to that theater in over 20 years. Boy, was I glad I went.

It is THAT spectacular.Then came the show: an incredible experience with beautiful costumes, terrific singers (who sounded like the originals, almost), and a foot-stomping good time.

50,Outstanding Broadway Theater; Old-School Charm & Elegance,"I have had the pleasure of seeing many sensational performances at the Pantages over the years: Book of Mormon, Shrek, Chicago, Lion King, Wicked, and so many more!Pantages is THE classic venue for catching a Broadway show in Los Angeles. While it is smaller than some theatres, it creates an old-school, elegant, intimate experience for the audience.A few things to note:- Pantages is on Hollywood Blvd, near Vine. It's not an overly safe, nor nice, part of town, but still ok.- Traffic getting to the area (particularly from West LA) sucks...and can be very difficult...leave with plenty of time to get there!- Dress is all over the place; some people are very dressy and some in jeans. Since it is LA, anything goes.- Many great bars/restaurants in the area. Of particular note is Cleo...just awesome.- Parking is expensive in the area...expect to pay $15 - $10 for parking and walk a block or two.- You can buy tickets online, via phone, or at the box office- The decor inside is awesome; classic Art Deco from when it was built in 1930.- The restrooms are still very old-school and the restroom lines are quite long!Pantages is outstanding! A must see if you are in LA. The performances and musicals at Pantages are among some of the best in the world and they are made even better by the classic venue and atmosphere of this historic theatre.A true 5-Star experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryW_SantaMonica_CA

50,Like You Landed in Shangri-La,"20 screen ""box"" theater multiplexes eat your hearts out! This place reeks Hollywood. Here is an Art Deco paradise and one of the greatest theaters in the world. The stories steeped in it are no less fantastic.These days there are live shows, such as War Horse. It was the Disney's search for a West Coast premiere of Lion King that inspired the fantastic restoration. But, this was once a movie palace - one of the last built after talkies came in. The 1930 extravaganza showed movies and had vaudeville acts between the reels. Sometimes the acts were larger ""spectaculars,"" and full-blown Hollywood premieres took place on many occasions, including spotlights and fanfare. Howard Hughes bought the building in 1949 via RKO and changed the name to RKO Pantages Starting in 1953 The Oscars were televised from this landmark.The lobby has twin staircases flanked by statues of godesses in ""Egyptian and Assiro-Babylonian"" styling. But there are some modern intruders such as a crew filming, and two airplanes born aloft by the godesses. The auditorium, seating 2,812, has a depiction of Apollo in a chariot. Again, modern times (1930 is as modern as it comes) intrudes with oil barons and California history. The ceiling steals the show, though. It is a radiating grillwork design of false ceilings leading to the ""true"" ceiling encrusted with ""stars."" It reminds me of the illusionistic work from the Baroque and Rococo theaters of the 1600s and 1700s. So there are two more borrowed references. Below it is a crystal chandalier. Every inch of this theater is lavishly decorated. Some may say it's a little much, but, hey, would you want a movie palace to look like a Shaker meeting house?And, if you're not won over by the past echoes; be the last one out. You may just get haunted by the ghost of Howard Hughes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartK374

If you choose the Red Line you will need a tap card, they are $1.00, plus fare at the stations machines.Looking for a quick bite before/after the show? Just 2 doors down from the theater is a great little sandwich shop that has been there forever! They serve pastry, sandwiches,and my favorite,' almost' foot long hot dogs, there are sodas, ice tea and coffee. My dog combo was $5.00. With each sandwich/dog you can choose from a list of great toppings. I am embarrassed to admit I can not remember the name of the shop! There are many other places to eat and/or drink in the area. All within a quick walk!Come early Stay late Hope to see you there!Have fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bertaannf
50,This is one cool Theatre,Walking into the Pantages is like talking a trip back in time. The theatre is beautiful so get there early and take a walk around. I like to visit several levels because each has a different view of the artwork on the ceiling. The key is to go to a show you want to see because that's why people go to the Pantages in the first place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardt707
50,Classical theater,Great shows and a classical beautiful theater . Metro station accross street from theater. Nearby eateries. Nice experience to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juliana1027
50,Excellent musical!,The musical was beautifully staged with wonderful scenes. The voices were all excellent. We loved the actions and especially the voice of Galinda!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519lindal
50,Wonderful Theater,"Beautiful theater on the inside. We saw Wicked and it was fantastic. Arrive about an hour before the performance and park across the street. It only cost us $10, very convenient. Make sure you use the restroom before the performance because there usually isn't enough time during intermission. I don't think there are any bad seats in the theater. We sat upstairs off to the side and had a great view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSFTN
40,Musical at the Pantages,"A truly historic theater in the heart of Hollywood. In recent years, I've seen ""Lion King,"" ""Wicked"", ""Mama Mia"" and ""Book of Mormon"" at this splendid venue. The production values are invariably splendid in this wonderful venue. My only complaint is that sightlines can sometimes be a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayK280
40,Wonderful Venue,"A classic theater in the heart of Hollywood. The play is the thing, but plan on lots of traffic getting there, particularly on a Saturday night. Plan ahead if you want to dine somewhere near, since the freeway cars move about 30 mph on Saturdays. No good food at the theater itself, so Google nearby restaurants if you want to eat before the play. And bring at least $15 to park close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rayu
50,What a gorgeous venue,"The Pantages is a remarkably beautiful, high deco-style theater. It was once a movie palace- accent on palace. So beautiful, so Old Hollywood. They have world class shows- we just saw Wicked, which was terrific- the lighting and acoustics are excellent, there's a good bar, excellent parking. It's just a very well managed place. Buying tickets in advance online is easy. Try to fit it into your visit to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moswanderlust
50,If you can - go!,"So happy to report the parking behind Pantages has handicap accessible parking and they were attentive and very accommodating to our needs. The handicap seating at Pantages is better then it appears on the website. Expect lines for the bathroom. The production we saw was outstanding, but that is to be expected there. The theater is art nuevo gorgeous with many photo op's - though you are requested not to photograph or video the performance, but that is to be expected. LA has such a great pulse; especially on Friday and Saturday nights. After the performance you feel as if walking out onto the Fremont Experience in Vegas. Long stem red roses are available for purchase as you leave the Pantages Portico and is a nice touch if you are there for a special evening. You will see formal attire to business casual (we were there on a Friday evening). Coupons and discounts are available via Groupon, Goldstar and other such free discount sites. We used Goldstar and got tickets for $60 each. Half of the price of Ticketmaster. A truly lovely evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/287kellys
40,An architectural beauty,"Home to touring productions of all the hit Broadway musicals, this 1930s beauty is worth the price of a ticket for whatever is currently showing just to marvel at the beautiful architectural decoration, which has been lost in so many theaters from that era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDinSocal
50,Best Birthday ever,"Took my daughter here to see Wicked for her birthday. It was raining, cold and the Oscars were being held down the street at the Dolby Theater. So, I thought, great..... there is going to be tons of traffic. I was wrong! We got up there without any traffic and found parking right across the street. I had never been to this theatre before and was amazed by how beautiful it was. The play itself gave me the chills and I was in tears. This is something I will remember for a long time coming. BEST TIME EVER!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viannc2014
30,Pantages is just too big for its Shows,They always put regular Broadway shows into this space and the Pantages is just too big. Audience winds up feeling like they're watching a TV show in a Sports Bar. Stage is WAY too far from most of audience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DANCEshow
40,Great Theater !,"We went to see Wicked the play. This is a really cool old building as they just don't make them like this anymore. Everyone was pleasant in welcoming you into the Theater. Our whole experience there was nice. You are right on Hollywood Blvd and the famous ""Walk of Stars"" is right there and you can walk up and down to see many more Stars or the other things that go on down there. Right across the street and half block to the east is a parking lot that was $10 at the time. I've been here before for a few things and its always first class entertainment. Plan ahead and expect LA traffic you don't want to show up late.believe me people watching will make the time pass fast...Its Hollywood !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyk744
40,Beautiful old theater,"I have seen several shows here and there is a definite charm to this theater. There are some really beautiful aspects such as the vanity room in the downstairs ladies room. It is all art deco mirrors and stools and takes you back to old hollywood. Downsides to this theater are: any seats located under the balcony (and there are a lot) have slightly obstructed views, the lobby is really small so it becomes very difficult to move in there, the bathroom lines are REALLY long so if you don't get in it right at the beginning of intermission you may not make it back for the first number. Otherwise, its a lovely place that offers wonderful shows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8melissaz
50,Amazing place,Great place. one of the must see things in Los Angeles. There is magnificent auditorium.Go there we recommend this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldN2253ZZ
50,Old School Charm with Great Shows,"Always a great place to take in a good Broadway show or musical. This is a classic theater with some rich history, and always has hit shows playing. Getting good seats can be pricey, but well worth it all things considered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RG_WorldTravel
50,Lovely,Such a well preserved old fashion theatre. The last two plays I saw there Wicked and Kinky boots were well produced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starviagera
50,Awesome Theatre,"Over the years, saw ""Wicked"" and ""Lion King"" at the Pantages, and each time was awed by the beautiful restoration work done on this theatre. From the moment you walk in the entrance foyer to the magnificent auditorium it's as if you are in a movie set from a bygone age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/what666
50,A Star is Born,"The theater itself is so unbelievably gorgeous, seeing a play (or concert) is just the added bonus. Some plays are understandably better than others, but that is always the case in the theater. Bathrooms are worth a visit, but be prepared to wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLAtourguide
50,Amazing,We came here to see Wicked and everything was amazing. The views are incredible. The theatre is incredible. The show was incredible. We parked for $10 about a block and half away. Perfectly safe lot and perfectly safe area. We bought black market shirts outside for $15 after the show. Pricey tickets but totally worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jrivvy
50,Fantastic theatre,"I've seen many shows here. It's a more intimate theatre for LA. Not really a bad seat in the house, whereas other theaters in LA and OC are so big, it's hard to see the stage.I've purchased group tickets in the balcony and had very good views. We've seen Phantom, Wicked, Lion King, Mama Mia, White Christmas to name a few. I've been to many shows in NY, and while this theatre may not be as intimate as some on Broadway, it's comfortable and easy access. Lots of great eateries around also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjv967
50,An Elegant Treasure,"I saw the musical Pippin at this theatre, loved it and was entranced walking into the lobby. The beauty of the architecture from the grand old days is so striking I didn't mind waiting in the lobby for the theatre doors to open.I appreciated that there was good coffee and treats to savor along with the elegance of the decor. The show itself was wonderfully staged, and I even got to bring in my coffee and treats..a real luxury!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556angelh
40,Great Theater,Saw Jersey Boys at the Pantages. It's a great venue. My only complaint is that the seating is somewhat cramped. There isn't much room between you and the seat in front of you. Reminds me of flying in coach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingsfan
40,Old World Hollywood,"Great Art Deco style theater with great perfomances. While a busy neigborhood, parking near the theater is relatively easy. Plus people watching in the area is fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4691CPsteves
50,Broadway LA.,"This theater is absolutely stunning inside! I love going to the Pantages to see plays and shows. Parking can be a bear considering it is smack dab in the middle of Hollywood, I recommend off sight parking and taking public to get close to the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whaledaker
40,Wicked was awesome!,"The venue is nice, with more leg room than others (e.g. the Forum), and gorgeous architecture. The acoustics are very good, and the size is small enough to have many chances to enjoy the show from a fine vantage point. We were front row of the mezzanine section center-left and really liked the view. A little pricey but worth it for Wicked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TehachapiWarren
50,Beautiful Theater,"We saw Wicked at the Pantages last weekend. The theater is beautiful, the architecture is art deco and absolutely stunning! There is a parking lot across the street if you come early enough to get a space but the subway stop is located directly across the street as well. The concession stand is over priced but that is to be expected for a theater in L.A. The restroom situation needs attention although I'm not sure how to solve that problem. the line was so long we actually walked across the street to the hotel and used their restroom during intermission and there was still a long line when we returned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dosomething0
50,Nice theatre to see a play while on tour,"The sound is good and the seats are comfortable, I don't find much to see at this playhouse that I haven't already seen a few years ago. If you have missed a play you have wanted to see check with the Pantages as they may have just the right revival for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jpresskin
50,Great venue- lovely old theatre,This theatre has all the charm of old Hollywood and is an excellent venue for any production. We saw Wicked and it was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel92253
50,WICKED awesome,"OMG. I loved it. The stage, the ambiance, the theatre is beautiful. We had amazing seats. The concessions are WAY over priced if you ask me. It was $7 for a small cup of coffee (NO THANK YOU) especially when I paid $400 for 2 seats, and $40 for a t-shirt (other shirts were $65). The line for the woman's bathroom was outrageous. We left and went to the small shady bar next door. BUT the PLAY was amazing, our seats were money well spent, and the shirt is, in my eyes, a priceless souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274olivial
50,Great Venue for Plays,I just saw Wicked here. Great play and the acoustics were good. An Art Deco style theatre that is right out of the Thirties. Good parking across the street. We saw a Matinee around two o'clock which allowed us to wander up and down Hollywood Blvd. the seats are comfortable and you should get there early to wander around and look at the architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
50,Spectacular Place to See Any Show,My favorite place to see a show. Going to see Wicked on Thursday and I never hesitate to book tickets for anything playing at The Pantages. Something special to experience for both tourists and locals alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3574MTmichaelt
50,Excellent Place to See Broadway Shows,"I have been Here Several Times in the Last Six (6) Months to See Several Touring Broadway Shows. The Shows Were Excellent and Outstanding. The Pantages Theater is Very Large and I would Highly Recommend that You Arrive Early to Wander Around Prior to the Show. Very Very Interesting, Beautiful and Classic Art Deco Interior. I was Awe Struck.If You See A Show or Something Else at the Pantages, Ample Parking Very Close By and Lots of Places to Eat and Also Good to Walk Around the Area and Take in the Atmosphere.A Great Experience. Outstanding.Highly Recommend to See A Show at the Pantages Theater and Enjoy Brunch, Lunch or Dinner at Any of the Many Eating Places in the Area. You Will Be Happy and Glad that Yo Did.Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrfoxycat
50,Beautiful Old Theatre,We saw Wicked at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles last weekend. It's a beautiful old Art Deco style theatre with great acoustics. At one time it was used for the Academy Awards. We try to see a production once or twice a year. We usually sit in the orchestra section although we’ve sat in the front of the mezzanine. There are great sightlines regardless of which section of the orchestra you sit in. The only problem with this theatre is that there are not enough stalls in the women’s restroom. The bathroom on the left as you exit the theatre into the lobby has the most stalls. Don’t even try to use the one on the right at intermission. You’ll never make it back in time. It’s definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CentralCoast2
50,Stunning!,Such a beautiful theatre. Absolutely stunning.Of course the food and beverages are expensive if you are seeing a show but the venue is stunning to look at and the seating is comfortable.Loved this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Young_and_Free_85
50,Love this refurbished theatre.,"I've seen a few shows here now, and the place is stunning. You can't help but look up when you walk in because the ceilings are spectacular art deco. The theatre is a good size for concerts and for broadway shows (I've seen both, most recently Wicked which was FANTASTIC). However, I think the best seats are the first 7-10 rows. If you are going for an evening and want to do dinner before hand, I recommend going parking at the lot diagonal from the theatre, and going to the W for drinks and a quick dinner. It's right across the street and extremely convenient. The W has valet service, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
50,Great historic theater,"I have been this theater twice -- in 2007 to watch the musical ""Wicked"" and in 2014 to watch the musical ""American Idiot."" This building is art deco style and is a beautiful example of it. Even though I saw modern shows, it really feels like you are stepping back in time when you enter it. There are parking lots across the theater for a reasonable price, and the W Hotel right across the street with a subway stop underneath. If you arrive early for the show, you can look down on the pavement for Hollywood stars and the names. If you get hungry after the show, there are bars and restaurants on the same street. Back in 2007, there were a lot of homeless people who bothered you, now there are hardly any as of 2014 when I visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aisle67
40,Wicked shows,Theater is wonderful and clean. The staff are helpful and happy to assist with questions or concerns. I took my young daughter to watch Wicked and it was AWESOME!!! A must see play at Pantages. You will have a wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocios162
50,Musical Theatre in the grandest of settings,"If you ever have a change to see a musical production at this grand old theatre, run, don't walk. Do take the subway.The building is designed as an art piece from the 20s. Make sure to walk around..... and don't run into anyone because the ceiling will capture you and won't let go.The productions are all excellent, the sound is first-rate and I look forward to my next visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNW-SoCal
50,Wonderful Art Deco Theatre,"We saw Wicked today in this wonderful theatre. Each production has been excellent. The sound is wonderful, I am always impressed that even in the mezzanine you can hear everything. The Art Deco is well maintained and lovely. Bathrooms can have a long wait during intermission so plan accordingly.Tip: mezzanine has ""stadium"" type seating if you want a mostly unobstructed view of the stage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathym505
50,Go!,"Hadn't been here since I was a child many years ago. This historic special place has aged well. The décor is interesting - everywhere you look ....and the theater doesn't really have ""bad seats"". Thoroughly enjoyed ""Wicked""! If you need the restroom at intermission - hurry - the line (switchbacks!) fills quickly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne32825
50,Hollywood treasure,"The theater is a work or art in itself. Add to that the shows, sound, seating, staff, and you have a recipe for a wonderful experience. Definitely worth the visit for the experience of old style elegance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614sammy2010
40,What a beautiful venue!,"We recently saw Wicked here. It's such a beautiful venue; I enjoyed looking around the lobby before the show. The acoustics were good and the seats were comfortable. I didn't brave the bathroom line at intermission because I was afraid I'd never get through in time and I didn't want to miss a minute of the show. You are permitted take the snacks and drinks you purchase there into the show, but not alcoholic drinks.As with most theatres, you are at the mercy of the head in front of you. I unfortunately was seating behind a very tall man who frequently moved his head from left to right. Even when the action on stage was stationary. But despite that, I saw an amazing show at a historic venue, and I really can't complain too much.We parked in Sunshine lot A as recommended by Ticketmaster when we purchased Wicked tickets. It was easy to get in and find parking, but getting out was a nightmare. I unknowingly parked by an exit gate and was unable to back out until the lot was nearly empty. In the future I'd probably use valet and visit one the restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dotfurio1
50,A Beautiful Art Deco Treasure,"We have attended performances at Pantages Theatre on two occasions: ""The Book of Mormon"", which btw is the funniest production ever, and most recently, ""Wicked"".

50,Must-see historic Theatre,"OK, I saw Pippin nearly a month ago, and just getting around to writing about the Theatre. The show was great! We sat in the first Mezzanine and could see and hear everything well. Now for the Theatre; If you're in the area and have an interest in Art Deco and historic styling, this is a MUST-SEE theatre. The decor is nearly over the top with its many metallic shaded medallions, statuary, and trimmings. Lighting is fantastic! The entire house seems to be in great repair, clean, and proud. I'm not sure that day-time tours exist but it would be nice to see and hear more about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gartenkerl
50,"Comfortable seats, beautiful architecture and tons of nightlife all around.","This was our first visit and we saw Kinky Boots, which was amazing!!

50,"Kinky Boots - Must See & Hear, fun !","My wife saw the show originally in NY and we've been waiting to see it here in Hollywood. for those of us old enough to remember Cindi Lauper, you will love the new, powerful, fun and witty lyrics. based on a try story it offers a message, ""to open your mind.""the very entertaining musical is a must see and hear event at the beautiful Pantages Theatre. get there early, park across the street for $10 and go to the W Hotel for drinks and great people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188averym
50,Kinky Boots,"We've been season subscribers for years and always look forward to productions at the absolutely gorgeous Pantages Theater. They're always good shows. Kinky Boots is no exception with everything you want from musical theater - a great talented cast, dazzling costumes, interesting story, a good score, good orchestra, and good sets. We've been to theater on Broadway and in London; we still prefer the Pantages. Wouldn't change a thing about it. Parking is real close and affordable ($10-15), ticket prices are reasonable, there are several restaurants within easy walking distance, better and more bathroom stalls than in NY (about 8 steps down from the lobby), consistently good shows, and an always friendly and helpful staff. It's located at historic Hollywood & Vine. If this is your first visit, allow time to enjoy the beautiful theater and be sure to look up throughout. If you're a subscriber be sure to join the free Audience Rewards to get extras like free parking or drinks, etc. Disability accessible. You'll leave Kinky Boots with a big smile on your face.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
40,Beautiful Theatre and Fun Performance!,"Recently we saw Kinky Boots at the Pantages Theatre. This is a beautiful venue, and you should come early to appreciate all the lovely woodwork. It is a work of art. We totally enjoyed the show and I appreciated that there was adequate leg room and good views for all in our party (we sat at the side in the mezzanine section). I had wished the chairs were a bit more comfortable, but once you get involved in the performance, that is not as noticeable. Parking in the area is reasonable, but $4 for a bottle of water is a bit steep in the theatre! Long line-ups at the bathrooms at intermission makes for a bit of a rush. The venue and performance were outstanding, and a memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneH46
50,Kinky Boots Opening Night,Went to see Kinky Boots and LOVED the show! The theatre is gorgeous and the seats are comfortable. Pretty cool to see Cindy Lauper & Harvey Fierstein as they were in the audience. :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvilCanadian
50,"Beautiful, historic building","We thoroughly enjoyed seeing Kinky Boots at the Pantages. It is a beautiful venue and the ceiling is stunning. Our seats were comfortable and everything looked and sounded great. As usual, there is quite a line for the restrooms. Even the men had a line, which they are not use to, and there was complaining from them. Because it is a historic site, there is nothing they can do about that. But everyone made it through in time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343theresas

40,Kinky Boots,"The show is a lot of fun but we thought something was very wrong with the sound quality the night we were there. We had previously attended a musical at the Pantages and in that case we thought the sound was excellent so, hopefully, this is a one-time or temporary problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justbetweenyouandme
50,Still an absolutely gorgeous theater!,"This theater has been beautifully maintained. Nothing looks worn. The bathrooms are still down a bunch of stairs, but that can't be helped. The ceiling is just amazing. I don't know if they have tours of the theater, but it is well worth seeing a show at the Pantages just to see the original art deco design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elysekomer
50,Breathtaking 1930's theater - - great history.,"We go to this theater regularly - - it has a stunning interior that has been renovated over the years. The history includes it's start as a movie house, and backdrop for television shows in the 50's. Howard Hughes also had a part of the history, having a viewing room. The latest renovation bright a lot of color and brightness, as well as recovered chandeliers. The ceiling in the theater keeps me mesmerized until showtime. Location is in the heart of Hollywood -- and it's fun to be part of the theater crowd getting to the shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artzgal
40,Better and better,"The Pantages has been around forever, and has a grandeur that new theaters don't try to attain. It used to be that it was located in a rather seedy stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, but with Hollywood's rebirth, this is no longer an issue!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Best bet for Broadway shows in LA,"This is a well-preserved mid-century theatre. A lot of the Broadway touring companies come through here. We have seen Wicked, The Book of Mormon, The Lion King, Pippin, Legally Blonde, etc., and will see Kinky Boots. The beautiful interior is roomier than New York theatres, so this is a good place to see those kind of shows.There is plenty of parking in the vicinity for around $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobK893
50,Beautiful theater,A very beautiful theater with an old world charm. Almost all seats are great. We had seats for the Book of Mormon in the Orchestra rows RR which was pretty far back but we still had a clear view of the stage. It might be a problem for the shorter of the lot because the elevation is not too much. The sound was a bit too loud but it was probably because of the production and not the theater. The theater itself is a sight worth seeing - with beautiful gilded details.A 500 ml water bottle costs 4$ in the theater - total rip off. Also it is difficult to make it to the loo during intermission - impossibly long queues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SapnaS_12
50,Good view from side seats,"Saw Pippin here last week, sat downstairs in Row RR. We had a great view of the entire stage, save a tiny slice of the side. I think there are no bad seats here. And in the past I've been here to see Wicked, and the Billy Joel show, and the talented performers bring me to tears every time. Great venue, we are lucky to be in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyloans
40,A Trip Back in Time,Saw Book of Mormon with my gal pals. A charming theater. Well executed and thoroughly entertaining show. Tip: Opt out of far left or right seats down in the orchestra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamplePlatter
10,Rude Ushers - Beautiful Theater,"I attended the opening night of Pippin on October 21st as a birthday gift from my brother who attended the show with me. During intermission I walked outside the theater to get some air. There were numerous people outside during this time. I then tried to enter the theater and the usher stopped me, and told me in an angry voice that I could not go back in without a ticket. I told the woman that my brother had the tickets, and I had no way to contact him. She called over a male supervisor who rudely told me that I needed to leave the theater or he would call the police. I felt harassed, and humiliated, and I insisted that I had tickets. After this confrontation he followed me into the theater and hovered over me, until I found my brother and showed him the tickets. Without apologizing, he simply turned around and left. This incident ruined my night and experience of the show. I have been to hundreds of theaters, symphonies, and musicals, and have never experienced the rudeness, and harassment that I experienced at your theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DHWChicago

40,Old-time Hollywood Art Deco Theater,"Love the decor of this retro theater! Had no issues with acoustics. Seats were comfortable. Intermission food & drink were passable, but not great.

The Theatre is stunning inside however the acoustics were a luttle under par and the sound quality of the show was disapointing. Didn't enjoy it as much as when we saw it in Vegas in a more modern, purpose built theatre, but still a great experince to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyofLeeds
30,PANTAGES SEATS TO AVOID!,"The very wide Pantages stage presents many sight line issues for most national tours which are designed for more standard, less wide prosceniums.CANNOT RECOMMEND PAYING FULL PRICE FOR SEATS IN THE FAR LEFT OR RIGHT SECTIONS OF THE ORCHESTRA or for ANY sections of the REAR ORCHESTRA.Once you're past row Z -- you're just too far away from the stage to feel a part of the live performance.If you cannot purchase orchestra seats in rows A to Z then I'd recommend purchasing ANY FRONT MEZZANINE SEAT. Even REAR MEZZANINE is better than REAR ORCHESTRA. Up there you'll see and hear the show much better than you will in the back of the main floor seating.Also try GOLDSTAR EVENTS to purchase DISCOUNTED seats to most productions. You'll save a little money and won't be paying full price for limited view or far away seating.Alas, our glorious Pantages Theater was not designed for the intimacy of live theater. It's a big ornate cavern that devours a show if you're not seated front, relatively center or in the front mezzanine.(And no matter how close you think your seats are, bring binoculars, you're still far away at the Pantages.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CEMILIOB
50,Go see a show!! Beautiful Venue!!,"I bought tickets the night before the performance for the Jersey Boys. We went to the 1:00 pm showing, which was perfect, so we could also walk Hollywood Blvd for quite the experience of people watching.There is a new building on the corner of Hollywood and Argyle that charged $10.00 for the day, this is a GREAT price. I have a large SUV, we fit in the parking structure, it was clean, neat and protected.The Pantages is beautiful, it has been years since I've seen a show here. I'm so glad we did!! With purchasing tickets at the last minute, I was concerned with our seats located in the Mezzanine section, needless to say, I had NOTHING to worry about. If you purchase in this section, any seat from row A-G, would be amazing!! You will not be disappointed. It was more quaint and closer to the stage then the map online indicated.I can not wait for another show to visit here, I'm looking forward to the Phantom of the Opera next year. I would advise to NOT eat across the street at Delphine, in the W Hotel, it is very expensive. I wish we would have trekked further West on Hollywood and eaten at the California Pizza Kitchen.Enjoy a show!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Urbanhick

The decor is absolutely over the top and you can spend the entire intermission just looking at the ceiling. If you choose to go get a drink there are enough bars that the lines aren't impossible.Parking can be a little daunting. You will have to pick one of the many surrounding lots.

50,ONCE was never enough,"Stepping into the Pantages Theatre is a step into everything grand about the Hollywood Experience. It is a MUST for each trip to LA! The hottest musical ""Once"" did not disappoint and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. The exquisite decor and chiseled grander that engulfs this setting is sheer elegance. No wonder may premiers have made their home in this historical theatre. The musical even encouraged ordering your drinks at the bar located on the stage as part of the pre-sequel act.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelad725
40,Review of Pantages - A Hollywood Icon,"I'm not going to review the show, ""Once"" although that was why we were there. It was just okay for various reasons. Luckily for me, I've been able to see several shows there over the last few years, and I'm looking forward to many more.I always try and start with the bad stuff then get to the good stuff. So bad stuff with the Pantages? Really the worst is the bathroom situation. They do their best, but it's time to really knock out some walls, put in some more and better bathrooms and just bite the bullet on this one. There is not enough time during intermission for everybody to get through the lines and get it done. So that's really bad.The second bad thing is accommodations for disabled and/or elderly folks. If you have a person who needs special accommodations, let them know (and that means, don't just do your booking online.) They do have some special seat areas if you have a wheelchair, but even if you use a walker, you should let them know and remember - you will not be able to be upstairs as there are no bathrooms up there and NO elevators. In other words, the balcony doesn't work for disabled/elderly people who need assistance.The other issue is bathrooms for the disabled - one small stall manned by an employee - one at a time only. Okay - nice they have a ""disabled"" only bathroom, but try and find this easily? That's a trick to begin with, then you have to be in a line, and do all of this within the parameters of the short intermission.So that is the worst part of this theater.The best - it's an iconic Old Hollywood Landmark. Beautiful and dignified - even if they need to put in better bathrooms! Okay, enough with the bathrooms which you usually just need once or not at all during a show. There is nothing like sitting in a theater and looking around at all of the amazing woodwork done by craftsmen of another era. It's really gorgeous and fun to be there.Parking is catty corner to the theater and is fairly easy to get in and out of. I was able to pull up in front of the theater to drop off and pick up my mom with her walker. Sure, people aren't thrilled when you pull up, but it would be nice if we all remembered that when people are doing this, it's usually to pick up a loved one who needs the help.They also have something I either didn't see, or didn't remember from a few years ago - a very nice unobtrusive closed captioning system that was useful to both my mom and I. She had a hard time with the sound making the dialogue a bit difficult and it was helpful to have. I have to agree - the sound did make the dialogue difficult to understand. I guess that's a problem of the production more than the Theater, though.So - what's the upshot? Go to the bathroom before you go to the theater, quite obviously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258LauraT

10,"""Once"" too much...","Took my girlfriend to closing night show of ""Once"". Sound was so offensively loud to start - 4 songs? - it compromised our hearing (we're in our 40s) so much that we were unable to discern the dialogue of the following play. We were so disappointed and BORED by this mistakenly adapted ""musical"" of such a brilliant film, we actually left at the intermission to find a stiff drink and a freshly painted wall to stare at until dry, never to return. It was that BAD. Lead actor's voice was fine, and leading lady was passable. However, the production seemed so under funded (two folding chairs for the apartment set above the Hover shop?) it was pathetically visually uninteresting. That, coupled with the horrendous sound issues made the experience extremely disappointing, not to mention EXPENSIVE. Mezzanine seating also a problem - middle section seating - we were directly behind the folks in front of us and unable to see! Terrible waste of money and time! Turned us off to this venue and future productions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HalW423

50,Spectacular venue,"We went to see Once at the Pantages, and it was a fantastic experience. It's a stunning art deco theatre, in splendid condition. We were sat in row W in the stalls, which had a great view, but it didn't look as if anywhere had a bad view. As ever with theatres, drinks and snacks were expensive, so you might want to take your own. You are allowed to take pictures in the foyer but not the auditorium.Once was a fantastic show. Moving, great songs, superb performances. If you enjoyed the film, you'll love the show - but actually I think it's even better than the movie.Plenty of parking nearby. We used the Pantages own parking for $12. There was no queue leaving the theatre afterwards but traffic was quieter in Hollywood because it was a Sunday evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Devolutionboy
50,Still a beautifully elegant theatre-,"Saw ""Once"" its last day in LA. Interesting performance- where the audience becomes part of the on stage bar patrons (at least at intermissions)Always great to visit the Pantages in its historic spendor.

10,"Pantages sound volume for musical ""Once""","I have seen three previous performances at the Pantages and enjoyed them both very much. i have seen numerous musicals throughout the years. The musical ""Once"" is not suited for this theater, and the Pantages Theater takes no responsibility for patrons not being able to hear. There are numerous complaints, and it is shocking to me that I could puchase $100 tickets and not hear the dialog.. When we complained the Assistant Manager explained that this play used a very low volume, and that this was not the responsibility of the Pantages. They offered us a volume booster which we declined, but took them up on the offer to move from the second row Mezannine to the Orchestra level. It was still very poor sound volume. Does a theater not have any responsibility to check volume levels, . It was a terrible disappointment, and my worst theater experience ever. It was also very shocking to think that the theater takes no responsibility, blaming it on the show itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422MaryAnne_F
50,Unforgettable!,"My wife and I, along with friends, saw 'Once' at the Pantages on Friday night...was able to have a beer ONSTAGE just before the performance...the performance was absolutely spectacular...the thing that made it UNFORGETTABLE was that, after the curtain call and standing ovation, we were told that we have a surprise in store...Glen Hansard himself then came out to thunderous ovation, thanked us, thanked the cast (this was the first time he'd seen this road company) and proceeded to pick up his guitar, and along with the rest of the cast, BLEW THE AUDIENCE AWAY with a spirited Irish tune and singalong...it KNOCKED OUR SOCKS OFF!!! Bravo Glen Hansard...Bravo ""Once!"" Chas C.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626chasc
50,elegant,The classically elegant decor brings you back in time to what a theatre should like. The seats are comfortable and the acoustics seem to be quite adequate. The do have a bar which is always popular. Snack items and water are offered at a steep price but not unusual for any venue. At least you come away with a bottle of water that says Pantages.The line to the women's restroom can get quite long but keep in mind there is one on the upper level that many people don't know about and is significantly less crowded.Allow ample time for parking as the immediate area can get quite crowded although there are plenty of lots available. If you plan on eating lunch or dinner beforehand it is not unreasonable to make your reservations a week in advance. The local restaurants cater to theatre times and do an excellent job of serving you quickly. Although often times ridiculously pricey I like to treat myself to an orchestra seat. Overall its a lovely experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yvettetravels
30,Wonderfule architecture but avoid with a wheelchair,"A wonderfully preserved theatre that was a delight to see, and the staging of Once worked really well. Total audience engagement from the moment you walked in. As others have noted it's right across from the subway and there's plenty of secure parking lots and a range of eateries from restaurants to casual nearby. However be warned that because theatres were designed differently back then, the slope in the auditorium is a big hill. Wheelchair seating is down near the stage and the only entry is from the back. Getting down was a challenge then getting up again was a struggle. Also there's only one wheelchair-accessible bathroom - thank you Pantages for putting an usher on the door to ensure only those who needed it had access, but at intermission the queue was six long. Unfortunately this was our first and last visit to this theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisF443

They were very inviting and welcoming.Lastly, the sound was so bad it ruined our night at the show. The singing and Music was fine, but, when the performs spoke, it was so soft that you had to strain to understand them. At first I thought it was just me, but at intermission, I asked several people around me and they were having the same problem. I missed half the dialogue because of the crappy sound.I can not recommend seeing anything here until they resolve the crappy sound.

They have a raffle 2 hrs before the show which can give you discounts on your tickets for that show if your name got picked. You can also take the red line train to avoid parking dramas.

50,Steve Windwood show,"What a GRAND historic theatre. Soooo happy I finally got to see a show here! Opened in 1930, this theatre was built for vaudeville back in the day. It is like experiencing the royalty of all art deco theatres! It is used for films, concerts and musicals. A real beauty! Went to see the Steve Winwood concert and I have to say that aside from being in such a magnificent theatre, I was... well... to be honest, a little bored with his show. I was really hoping to hear all my old faves - as in his big Top 40 hits and my personal fave of all time ""Arc of a Diver"". Alas, it seemed that he was much more interested in playing his more obscure songs, which is totally cool if you are a major Steve Windwood fan, but just being a run of the mill fan, you would probably have felt a little lost like I was. Regardless, what an incredible venue! I would DEFINITELY go back to see another show there and all the better if the show is as good as the theatre itself! Hint: just save yourself the headache of hunting for a legal parking space in Hollywood and park in the massive garage just to the east of the theatre for $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265

Looking at it outside, it just feels like it is a piece of music in mid flow, with a very unique architectural design.Inside, it was divided into really interesting sections and was modern and austere but in a good way. It reminded me of the inside of the Sydney Opera House on a smaller and more modern scale (the interior space).All in all, a wonderful place to visit or tour if you are in the area.

Was here to see The Book of Mormon (which is absolutely hilarious and if you get a chance to see it anywhere in the world you should while its touring) and the sound, acoustics, everything was great. Only issue with Pantages is there are only two bathrooms in the whole place, which can create some narly lines during an intermission period.

50,Old Hollywood feel.,Excellent venue to see a play or musical. It has a real old Hollywood look and feel to it. There is a parking lot a block down the street so it is fairly easy to find parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4624VIjohns

50,Landmark Deco theater in the heart of Hollywood. . .,"The Pantages Theater on Hollywood Blvd's Walk of Fame is a fully functional example of 1930's Art Deco theater design by Scottish architect Benjamin Marcus Priteca. I was recently there for Book of Mormon and make a point of returning often when Broadway shows come to town. Retrofitted for good sound, this is also a beautiful and intimate setting for concerts. The architectural details on the walls and ceiling, the sweeping staircases, and Art Deco light fixtures transport one back in time to Hollywood's glamorous heyday. I recommend using the L.A. Metro Rail to get around town. This theater is directly across the street from the Hollywood/Vine Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cattylea
50,Beautiful Venue!,"The Pantages is a beautiful, historical theater located in Hollywood. It's a great place to see a broadway musical and enjoy the architecture and decor. It's also conveniently located to several restaurants and is across the street from The W Hotel (which has a great restaurant and bar/lounge area). And, you can also see more stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,Very cool,"Got tickets to see Green Day's American Idiot. It was very interesting. I have seen cats, but a rock band thing.. awsome",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alevenson81
50,Beautiful Theatre,This is an old restored theatre which is absolutely beautiful. There is something to see everywhere you look. There isn't a bad seat in the house and being in the heart of Hollywood it is near many great restaurants on Hollywood Blvd. Great place for an afternoon or night showing. Parking is easy and the area is safe. Be sure to hit the bathroom prior to the performance as the lines really back up at intermission. Definitely put this on your to-do list if you haven't been here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyg554
50,Awesome Art Deco building,Love this theatre. When we walked in I was transported back to old Hollywood. Truly beautiful. Saw The Book of Mormon there and was very comfortable even though we were at the back could see very well. I loved all the Egyptian statues and the ceiling. Go check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAXbuzz
50,Gorgeous Theatre!,"Came here to see The Book of Mormon in its last week run. Had seen The Lion King previously and was lucky enough to get orchestra seats, but this time I booked for the Mezzanine (balcony), never having had the experience of sitting there before so was concerned about the sight lines. Not a worry once we got to our seats! Ever seat seems destined for a perfect view. What a show too! Plus the Art Deco decor is simply gorgeous. Snapped quite a few pictures of the ceiling! We ended up finding parking diagonally across the theatre which was reasonable and fairly priced. Quite a few eating venues too around the theatre for anyone looking for a bite before or after the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontrealCanadian
50,Great theatre,"Love this theatre, saw The Book of Mormon, had great seats, love the beautiful décor, the ambiance and the great location. I've lived in LA my whole life but always feel like a tourist when I enter the Pantages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darby30
50,"Beautiful theater, a masterwork of Art Deco style.","Saw the Book of Mormon here, first time to visit this venue. I couldn't stop staring at the ceiling and the rest of the magnificent décor. As for the play, it was well acted, but not a play for children. It was rude, profane, insulting, but terribly funny at the same time. It would be very offensive to those who are Mormons, which I am not, but I have many friends who are LDS and I definitely would not recommend it to them. The story is spot on in making references to the Mormon beliefs, and for those who are not familiar with the LDS doctrine, it may not make a lot of sense. However, for those who do know the Mormon beliefs, it was funny. The beauty of the theater was the highlight for me. Parking is at a premium so arrive early if you are attending.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolHarb

50,Was the theater better than the play?!!,"First off, we truly enjoyed the Book of Mormon.However, the star of the show may have been this great old theater. What a throw back...I kept looking into the corners for Gable, Lombard, et al.

50,Gloriously fabulous venue!,"My son and I attended a performance of The Book of Mormon at the Pantages last night. My son had been to the theater before, but I was visiting from upstate New York, and this was my first time.The other reviewers who have raved about this venue are absolutely right -- it is truly fabulous. The art deco style (way over the top!) is magnificent and beautifully preserved. If you can do nothing but tour the theater, it is worth it!!Our seats, in the middle of the second row of the Mezzanine, were perfect and quite comfortable.I will say that the sound system was a little much. At times it was hard to understand the lyrics because the sound was somewhat distorted. I am an actress, and I know that when such theaters were originally built, performers didn't have the benefit of mics and speakers -- they had to project enough to hit the back of the balcony -- and the theaters were built to acoustic specifications. Today it just seems like louder is better -- and I don't agree.The employees are so friendly and helpful, all smiling and acting as though they are really happy to see you. This really impressed me since many employees in NYC venues act as if they are doing you a favor when they deign to speak to you.And the show? Not for the prudish, definitely -- but extremely well done and very funny. Kudos especially to Cody Jamison Strand, who played Elder Cunningham. His comic timing was perfection -- I think we'll see a lot more of him!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grammymem

50,Do not Miss seeing This Venue,"We have been to this theater several times and are always amazed at how beautiful it really is. It is probably one of the best preserved art deco style theaters in Los Angeles and there are a few. And it is one of the most beautiful theaters we have visited any where in the world.You may not know that Los Angeles has many wonderful examples of art deco architecture in the heart of its downtown. Yes, Los Angeles. Most visitors and locals are completely unaware these wonderful buildings exist because they are not highlighted, many are covered with gaudy neon signs and billboards or they exist in parts of the downtown that do not interest most people. For a real treat, join a Conservancy tour of these beauties on a Saturday morning and be surprised and amazed!Getting back to the Pantages, not only is it a striking example of a bye-gone era but it is also a wonderful theater for taking in a production. The seating is comfortable and I do not believe there is a bad seat in the house. There are plenty of refreshment stands for varied snacks before, after or during the shows. For such a small lobby, the concessions are extremely well run and efficient. Lavatories cue-up at intermission but the lines move extremely fast. Ushers are very helpful and friendly.Pantages' website is very well organized and easy to navigate making buying tickets fast and easy. They also have an option for buying your parking while buying your tickets. You are transferred to other sites for these procurements but they also are easy to navigate.Parking is in a city lot immediately across the street, Lot A which is large, safe and fairly easy/quick for getting into and out of. Parking if you buy it on line is $12 but if you purchase your parking at the lot you save $2. Get there at least an hour before show time to allow yourself adequate time to get in your seat. The theater is also served by Metro's Red Line with a station immediately across from the theater. Whether you take the Metro or drive allow yourself a few minutes to take a look inside the Metro station at it's architecture which is a tribute to the film industry.Our last vist to the Pantages to see The ""Book of Morman."" I wished we had missed this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlOjai

50,Awesome theater,"I'm an off and on season subscriber here because I like the theater so much. Unfortunately, I don't always love the line-up of shows, otherwise I'd get tickets every single season.

40,Gorgeous Interior,"The Pantages is one of the classic theaters still in existence, and the renovation a few years ago was really well done. It is worthwhile to come a bit before a performance to be able to walk around the lobby areas and appreciate the architecture.Unfortunately, the acoustics are still poor. Even if you're not hearing impaired, do rent one of the listening devices.Tickets are pricey at this venue. Check Goldstar, Groupon, or Living Social for various discounts and deal packages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
40,Regentrifying,"The theater was packed which was fine as the seats were comfortable and the entrance and exit methods were well thought out and it was easy to arrive and leave the theater. The ushers were knowledgeable and helpful. My only complaint would be that the theater has been crumbling and is only now being repaired so tickets have an additional fee to compensate. In the meantime, the repairs are not done although the theater is fully functional. The original décor is being maintained which is wonderful and rare in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielaA279
40,The Book of Mormon,"Came here on Thursday, 4/10/14 to watch The Book of Mormon.The Venue: The theater itself is charming within its retro decor and historic architecture. The space is big, but not huge; therefore, it does feel crowded if there is a full house, as it was when we attended, making it almost impossible to walk around without bumping into each other. The seating area is a good enough in size where it feels open yet you don't risk having a bad seat. We sat in the Orchestra PP section and the view and sound were great.They have candy and drink stations, but you're not allowed to take your drink into the auditorium Itself, unless it's non-alcoholic beverages in their souvenir coup. I was disappointed that they only sell sugary stuff yet don't sell popcorn, the latter is a must for me at shows. The bathrooms get PACKED, so much so that even the men's restroom had ridiculously long lines.The Program: The Book of Mormon is HILARIOUS and politically incorrect at all levels, therefore, not for the easily offended, specially if you are hardcore about religious faith. The show takes humor to put religion, human gullibility, beliefs, race & behavior into perspective. Prepare for some hilarious shock effect, but great dialogue starter, if you're paying attention to the topic.Am looking forward to experiencing this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aztkdiva
50,Best Theatre Ever!,"I saw ""The Book of Mormon"" at Pantages. I attend a lot of theatre and Pantages is the best venue. It is a beautifully restored Art Deco theatre. I sat in the balcony, and it looked to me like there was not a bad seat in the house. Acoustically I thought it was great. I look forward to a return trip to LA and another production at Pantages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961rebeccat

50,Gorgeous Theatre-Super Funny Musical with Book of Mormom,The Pantages is one of the most glorious testaments to elegant theater architecture and design. The interiors are so beautiful that one could spend time just gazing and admiring the details. Four of us were able to grab orchestra seats for the production of The Book of Mormon after trying unsuccessfully to get reasonably priced tickets in New York and San Francisco in the last two years. The wait was the worth it and the musical did not disappoint. We were laughing so hard throughout the show that the time just flew by. We are now planning to fly to Los Angeles to see more productions as the Pantages is a terrific venue. The Book of Mormon is a seriously funny production and a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StarLady99
50,Book of Mormon,What a gorgeous venue. This was our first time there and were impressed by the ambiance of the theater. Plenty of cocktail lounges and I like the fact you can take drinks (non-alcoholic) and snacks in to the theater. Seats were comfortable and had a great view. Only real issue is the restrooms. I have never had to wait almost 10 minutes in line to use the restroom and I am a male. The restroom lines made the intermission longer than it should have been.We will return for other performances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shootinfool
50,Beautiful,"Went to see the Book of Mormon and did not regret it. It is a very nice venue and even the mezzanine seats had a good view.

40,"Beautiful theatre, great day out.","This theatre is located in the heart of Hollywood and is beautiful. The shows are great and there isn't a bad seat in the house. The mezzanine seats can be a little tight for larger persons. The restrooms can become quite crowded during intermission, but are very well maintained and clean. The staff is extremely friendly and polite and are very willing to help with whatever you need. The parking is located across the street and is very tight! The spaces are small and they park 100's of cars in the lot. I recommend getting there early to get a good parking spot. I was once told to park in the aisle between cars and to leave my keys in the car. I didn't leave my car that day, I went to another lot. I highly recommend this venue for its uniqueness and beauty. There is no handicapped access to the mezzanine level. You must take 2 flights of stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveln4
50,Just take a look inside,"Right on Hollywood just east of Vine, The lobby and seating area is out of this world. Even if you don't have a ticket you have to take a look inside.

50,Go to the Theatah!,"This Art Deco landmark is a great venue. Such a beautiful place. I recommend though, that any tickets you buy are out from under the balcony. I never liked to have the balcony block my view of the stage. I also suggest using one of the higher floors for the restroom during intermission. The lines are usually shorter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deabs8
50,beautiful venue,"The sound is the only criteria to take into consideration for your viewing pleasure. You need to get tickets anywhere except under the balcony area, as the sound gets a bit blocked there. So make sure to ask when making your reservations. Everything I have ever seen there has been of the highest of quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mecoh
40,"Great theater, parking & concessions could be improved","My wife and I had not been to the Pantages for 10 years, but recently saw Book of Mormon. The iconic Art Deco theater at Hollywood and Vine is stunning and I recommend you go early to take in the view (however interior doors don't open until 1/2 hour before performance so don't go too early). We had great seats, but I do not think I would want to sit in the nosebleeds for obvious reasons.Restrooms were at capacity during intermission, but my wife said the staff was very efficient at getting folks in and out. Concession lines were long, but I cannot comment on how fast they moved.I checked the parking options nearby on the Internet before we left and unfortunately after arrival we found at least 2 of the sites were not available due to construction. While we eventually had no problem getting parking a block or two away, a little more information up front would have made it easier during rush hour.Still a great place to see a performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10071stevep
50,Broadway Theatre in Los Angeles,"Do you want to see Broadway Musicals in Los Angeles. This theatre in Hollywood is the place to do it. Gorgeous theatre. For many shows there is a lottery for $25 tickets. You show up 2-1/2 hours before curtain to submit your name with the request for one or two seats. Your name is but in a bin. Two hours before the show names are selected at random - up to 25 seats. If you have flexibility, it is a great way to snag an inexpensive ticket. (Full price is around $125 for orchestra seats.) I've won in the past when not a lot of folks show up. Unfortunately this week there were lots of players for Book of Mormon. I lost three times. After the lottery is over...if the show is not sold out, the box office sells single tickets for $45. I snagged an excellent seat at this price and was more than pleased.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142

30,Glad we saw it here instead of paying $300 for tickets in NY,"The theater is gorgeous...paying $30 to park behind the theater! Ouch! The guy said he gave us a ten dollar discount from the $40 price. I had so been looking forward to this production and there were parts where I laughed along with everyone else and I know it is a spoof of the Mormon Church and cults and brain washing and we laughed, too, but some parts were so uncomfortable to watch and offensive. I get it, ""It's a metaphor and a state of mind"" like one of the characters say but singing a song where over and over the lyrics are ""F--- Y-- God"" and you are listening to people laugh at this it is just not my sense of humor. My husband and I are theater buffs and have seen a hundred or more musicals and many we go to over and over like, ""Wicked"". This one we will pass on seeing again. The actors did a really good job and the leads were brilliant. We are definitely not prudes but this was not for us. We are glad we spent money for tickets for the touring group instead of going to see in New York. I really wanted to like this.The theater itself is amazing and we have seen other plays here. The acoustics are so good that even when the actors speak very quietly it is still very easy to understand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anniedutch13
50,Beautiful...must see,"This theater is beautiful 1930's architecture. I was in awe looking at the chandelier & the whole ambience of this old theater. We went to ""The Book of Mormon"" & it was great. The acoustics are really good & it doesn't matter where you sit, the view of the stage is good. Would definitely recommend this as a must see/attend when you are in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/493EllenW
50,Old Hollywood,"As a child, my hands-down favorite place to see movies was the Pantages (and yes, they once showed movies there.) It was a fabulous, ornate movie palace with a circular snack bar in the center of the lobby, two majestic stairways leading upstairs to the balcony and an enormous screen. There was something reassuring about the sound of feet padding up a carpeted stairway, and a feeling of importance at any screening in this location.I was sad when they stopped showing films there and didn't really have occasion to see any stage productions at the Pantages until the eighties, when I landed a goldmine and purchased tickets for my favorite musical (Camelot) with my favorite King Arthur (Richard Harris-- sorry, Burton fans.) Our seats weren't fantastic, nor were they bad either. I was able to view all the nuances of expression on the actors' faces and the dialogue came through crystal clear. So impressed was I that I went back for closing night (at the end of which Richard Burton was welcomed on stage, took his bows and then announced ""Now, let me show you how it really should be done!"") That night, I was nearly in the back of the theatre, and enjoyed the play just the same.Since that night, I've been to many, many performances at the Pantages, and I've yet to score a bad seat. I haven't had issues with columns blocking my view (I don't believe there ARE columns...) nor were acoustics ever an issue when my hearing was still intact. These days, I rely upon one of their free listening devices and I get along fine. The one problem with the device, I've found, is that it needs to be aimed at the stage, and I've had some instances in which the person in front of was frequently changing position and flipping her long tresses every which way, both of which caused the sound to go temporarily staticky. The listening aids aren't quite as good as the ones at the Ahmanson, but they're good enough.For my own part, I really like the theatre-going experience at the Pantages. To me, it's an opportunity to embark upon a trip backward in time and appreciate the grandeur of Old Hollywood in its heyday. Close your eyes a little and you can easily envision this theatre hosting premieres; searchlights lighting up the entrances; limos parked out in front; ladies in elegant gowns; men in tuxedos... and then someone crosses your path in shorts and sandals and ruins the daydream.Parking isn't necessarily ideal with the largest lot located on Argyle, one block southeast of the theatre. Only once did we find this lot full, which required us to park an additional block to the south. For those with mobility issues, this can be a bit of a haul, so it's best to obtain specifics from the box office or the theatre web site when you purchase tickets. Though I don't believe there's really a bad seat in the house, please be aware that handicap seating is only on the orchestra level and tends to be at the extreme end of a specified rows. While this may not be an issue for some, it may be that proper viewing will require a sharp turn of the head to view the stage. My sister, as it happens, lacks the ability to turn her head to the extreme, so for her the Pantages is a poor fit-- but if that doesn't happen to be your issue, go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailg306

40,Nostalgia at her best,This theatre is beautiful and well kept with a lot of things too do within walking distance whether waiting for a show to start or looking for dinner after the matinée. Seats are surprisingly generous given that older theatres seats are notorious for being unbearably narrow ; and as long as you're not further 5 rows back on the mezzanine level there really is no bad seats in the theatre in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curlychic1986
50,Love this theater,I have been here to see shows over six times and loved it every time.Beautiful theater with good shows. I have never bought seats in the upper second level but have walked up there and it looks like the view of the stage would be good. The view of the ceiling is great from the second level just walk up there during the intermission and have a look. Long lines for the restroom and bar when intermission hits be quick. Lots of parking for about $10.00 in lots nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bowiebow

40,Beautiful Theater in Hollywood,"People who say LA doesn't have a theater scene are just ignorant. Pantages is a mid-sized, old style glamorous theater with a robust annual programming located in Hollywood. There is a Metro station directly across (underneath W Hotel) providing transportation from Downtown LA or North Hollywood. If you're driving, try looking for street parking along Hollywood Blvd/Franklin Blvd or Santa Monica Blvd (of course, always check for parking restrictions). If all else fails, try the big parking lots near the theater for about $ 10 USD. With recent developments, there are quite a few high-end restaurants (Cleo at the Redbury, Delphine at W) to chains (Tender Green, The Melt, Waffle House) within walking distance. Recently saw War Horse there and will be seeing Evita this week. Instead of buying tickets online with huge sur-charges, try going to the box office a week or so ahead of your desired date and you can save quite a bit. For example, the cheapest seats are about $ 25 USD (Ticketmaster sur-charge is a ridiculous $ 8 which would make it $ 33). Of course, when something like Book of Mormon returns, all hell will break loose. Now put on your fancy tots and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whohowwho
40,War Horse,"My wife and I were invited by friends to attend a Saturday matinee showing of War Horse. The puppeteers were amazing at bringing a metal shell of a horse alive. Though I am not crazy about the story, having seen the movie, it was amazing to watch how they made the horse caricatures believable and that the actors even mounted and rode them at times.My only criticism about the production itself was, why did they cast a woman with obvious Asian characteristics to play the part of a French girl? That was very distracting and reminded me that I was watching a play rather than being drawn into the story itself.The theater is grand in its decor and ambiance. It is comparable to the spectacular movie palaces created during the golden age of film.Parking right next to the theater cost $20. I don't know what they charge for an evening performance.One trick is if you can go to the box office to buy your tickets in advance you can avoid the sometimes outrageous fees tacked on by ticket vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBA-Editor
40,Gorgeous Theater,"It's a great theater with a bunch of different great shows! We go whenever we can. The only part I don't like is how large the theater is; other ones I've been to in NYC and London are smaller and you can get better seats. Also, don't hold your camera up high and take a picture or the security will take it. (Yes, I learned the hard way.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamx2013
50,Great theare,The Pantages is a great venue for musicals and plays. The thetre itself is beautiful and all seats are good. Good restaurants and bars close by if you want to make an entire evening of it. We love going to this theatre and highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimH168
50,TRIP BACK IN TIME,"This historic theater is like taking a trip back in time, the interior looks like something from the 30's. There is not a bad seat in the house. The sound is excellent and light matches. We have been to several plays here and it is by far our favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JIMDAWG13
50,Beautiful theatre,"Last year we saw the Book of Mormon at this theatre. We had such a great time that we bought a season subscription for this years musicals. We saw The Wizard of Oz last night and enjoyed it greatly. The place its self has great decor and beautiful Art Deco chandeliers. We have sat in the upper center area and had a great view. Our seats for the season are on the far left side of the orch level row Q. We are close to the stage but our view is partially obstructed when the action is in the back left corner of the stage. However, overall we are very happy! Can't wait for the rest of the season!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravelca02
50,"Magnificent building, wonderful show and an essential place to visit.","We went to this theater to see Beauty and The Beast and I was amazed by the building as well as the play.

50,Lovely theater - not a bad seat in the house!,"The Pantages is a lovely old theater in the heart of Hollywood. I've sat upstairs, downstairs ( and in her lady's chamber!) and always had a great view. Sound is fantastic . They always bring the top current shows to LA. I most recently had the pleasure of seeing the classic musical The Wizard of Oz. Also looking forward to seeing Warhorse next month. The staff are very friendly and efficient and obviously enjoy their job. It is most conveniently situated opposite the subway at Hollywood &Vine too! Highly recommend the Pantages if you are looking for a legitimate theatre experience in an old historic building. One word of advice is to remember the bar is cash only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AskEileen
40,A Lovely Theatre From Hollywood's Old Glory Days,"This is a very beautiful & opulent theatre that has been very well looked after since it's glory days long ago.

You can get tickets easily curbside M - F, well ahead of time for the popular shows, of course!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewindatourfeet
50,Always has a touring B'way show,"This is a gorgeous restored theater that has first class tours of Broadway shows. It is great for you and your family--depending on what is offered--but musicals have a full b'way orchestra and you will have a true theatrical experience here.If you can't get to NYC this is the next best thing. There is parking all around, and slowly this Hollywood neighborhood in revitalizing with condos and hotels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizznyc
10,Sister Act and the Pantages,"On July 26 while visiting LA, we attended a performance of Sister Act. The production was a quality production...especially the leads. However, the sound system at the Pantages was the worst I have ever experienced. It was so loud that the voices were distorted most of the time, even moving fro row 3 to row 34 at intermission. Even the people around us were complaining. My suggestion to visitors is to stop by a view the beautiful theatre and then find a different theatre or form of entertainment. You WILL regret your choice and be almost 300 dollars poorer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthCarolinaNiffer
30,Online parking pass is more expensive,"Paid additional $12 for parking when I bought show tickets online. But the parking lot only charges $10 cash. I also had a hard time printing the pass, had to call ticketmaster twice and wait 30-45 minutes for help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PIL2002
50,"Sister Act, The Musical at one of Hollywood's Finest","We were really happy to get tickets to the next to the last performance of Sister Act at the Pantages. We were in Row V, seats 307-310 Orchestra section and had a great view of the stage. The actress who played Deloris Van Cartier was sensational ! All of the actors/actresses/singers were wonderful ! It's hard to pick out a favorite number or scene because they were all so good ! We read lots of reviews before we purchased our tickets and I decided to write a review because Sister Act, the Musical is a ""must see"". It is entertaining, funny and has a meaningful message for everyone. Don't believe the negative reviews !! There are several lots to park your vehicle near the Pantages. We choose a covered parking lot off of Argyle St. We walked up the stairs through Trader Joe's and then it was a short walk to Hollywood Blvd. and the Pantages. After the show we bought a couple things at Trader Joe's and got an hour free validation. Parking was $9.75 from approximately 12 PM - 4 PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
40,"Beautiful Old Style Theater, No Bad Seats","We recently saw Sister Act at the Pantages. The theater is old Hollywood. Ornate would be the word to describe it. The seats are very comfortable. We sat in the second to the last rear row of seats and have a good view of the stage. The acoustics were very good. Given that I would advise not spending a lot of money on the expensive seats, buy the cheaper seats near the rear. There are plenty of good places to eat within walking distance. As for the parking, if you are willing to walk one block over you will find the price of parking drops significantly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lance2002
30,Stunning building-Smallest Seating Ever!,"First, let me begin by saying the theatre itself is stunning. The architecture is absolutely amazing. Now, to the not-so-good...The lines to get something to drink were absolutely unbelievable, and so were the people in them..and NOT in a good way...they were HORRIBLE! No organized ""lines"", so people were jamming in like cattle and would either walk in front of you or shove their way in front of you...sad...Restrooms....ladies...get ready to wait, and wait and wait......then, squeeze into a train sized restroom stall....Seating....these are obviously the original seats because they are TINY! My poor teenager and I were sitting sideways....you couldn't sit facing forward because you would be literally shoulder to shoulder with the person on either side of you...and if you are over 5'5, either your knees will be jammed in into the back of the seat in front of you or you won't be able to fit them at all, hence, sitting kinda sideways-wonky in the seat....very uncomfortable for any extended period of time...like a show!Non of these things will prevent me from purchasing tickets at this venue, mostly because this is the only place you can see them...just be advised....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mom-2-4boyz

50,great,I have visited this theatre twice and its AWESOME there are large varieties of Broadway shows like phantom of the opera and west side story per season and the best part of this is that they have a bundle price so if you decide to watch five shows in one season its 50 to 60 percent cheaper. The theater it self is a master piece and they have great sound and viewing quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuzElenaR_13
50,My favorite theatre in Los Angeles,"They used to do the Academy Awards from this theatre. The lobby is not terribly notable though the sculptures give a hint that this facility has a notable history. But what I liked best was the great chandelier and lighting inside, especially if you are sitting in the balcony. There are not a lot of these movie palaces left, and this one comes highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoeytampa_FL
40,Apart from the photo police - great!,"As a couple of Brits visiting LA, we went to the Pantages Theatre to see Rain - a better than average Beatles tribute band (all the shows at this theatre are rather mainstream and middle-brow). The real draw though, was the theatre itself, a must-see pinnacle of art deco splendour and exuberance. The lighting, acoustics and sightlines are excellent, but while they allow photos in the lobby, they employ a lot of annoying little twerps to stop you taking photos in the main auditorium (fair enough during the show, but what's the harm otherwise?). As with most LA attractions, the staff were unfriendly, vapid and insincere, and unless you get to the rest-rooms pronto during the interval you're stuffed. Worth it for the decor, but the management and staff need work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DieselB

30,If you want to have a good time leave your camera in your bag,"My husband and I recently went to a production of beauty and the beast here. Very intimate pretty theatre and I'd have to say there are really no bad seats. The only time I had trouble seeing was because of the cut out trellis and the actor being at the top of the stairs I'm sure that isn't a problem in other productions. My only problem really is that they spent tons on a renovation and they are so annoying about the no photo policy. I mean fine don't let me take pictures of the plays but before it starts really threating people to delete their photos who were just taking a picture of themselves in the seats big deal. And whats wrong that you don't want pics of our chandelier out there. Sorry they were a bit over the top about the photo policy, during the play they were running thru the place yelling at people. It was annoying, otherwise I great night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darin_and_Christi

50,Magnificent Theatre,I've been to the Pantages many times and I always love coming to this theatre because of the atmosphere and design. The feeling of walking into the theatre and down the aisles to the seats of a classy place; where many people are dressed up for a night out on the town is such a unique experience. The theatre just reminds me of the grand theatres portrayed in movies and tv shows; and it puts you in another world when you walk in. My latest visit to this theatre was for Beauty and the Beast; which was so perfect at this location. The grandiose of the theatre added to the ambiance of the event - it was such a special night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kchen83
50,Beauty and The Beast,"My family and I saw Beauty and The Beast and had a wonderful time. This is the third Broadway Production I have seen at the Pantages and once again, I was impressed.

50,Beautiful Theater,"Went to see Beauty and the Beast on Easter Sunday. The show was spectacular, as would be expected of any good touring show. The theater itself was phenomenal. The decor is absolutely beautiful and the carvings along the wall/proscenium were quite intricate. All the grandiose of days gone by flood back when you walk through the doors. Definitely a place to experience for live productions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/failtedakota
50,Similar to Broadway!,The pantages puts on beautiful and exciting shows. I have seen several musicals and plays there. I saw Wicked on Broadway a couple years back. Last year we saw Wicked at the Pantages and the same Galinda from Broadway was performing. I have seen about nine different plays and musicals at the Pantages and I have been happy with every single one. This is a really great place to get your arts and culture in :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hulagirl926
50,Always a Great Night Out,"As of late have seen 3 shows at the Pantages.....Catch Me If You Can, Jekyll and Hyde, and Peter Pan...each show spectacular in its own rite, however it is the elegance of the Theater, the Pantages that makes ANY event just a bit more enchanting. The Pantages Theatre is located at 6233 Hollywood Blvd, between Vine and Argyle Streets. $10 parking is nearby and you can walk to several nice (or cheap) eatery's. Or take a stroll down Hollylwood Blvd and end with a nite cap at the W Hotel across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naninofro

50,Tips for saving $$,"I'm someone who enjoys Broadway-style theatrical productions but who doesn't want to pay Broadway style prices. For this reason, I've been a season subscriber with Pantages for about two years. I've gotten orchestra and mezzanine seats averaging about $18-30 per ticket (with no added processing fees), a substantial savings considering most show tickets are over $40. Fortunately, the Pantages Theater is a relatively small theater, so you can't really get a bad seat there. This would probably be the best value for the frequent theatergoer. There are other ways to save, of course, without being a season subscriber. For example, you can sometimes find orchestra (L/R) seat tickets for under $50 online or at the box office. Keep in mind that shows during the weekday (M-Th) are usually cheaper than weekend shows. The Pantages also has a pre-show lottery system where they sell tickets for $25 to some lucky winners who sign up for the offer two and a half hours before the show.For cheap drinks and snacks, try Ronnie's Donuts next door. It's a 'hole in the wall' donut/sandwich shop with snacks and drinks for under $5. Much less than what they typically sell at the theater's concession stands. Another thing to consider in this area is the parking, which can get expensive. Some places will even charge $20. But I usually park a block and a half south of Hollywood Blvd. on Vine St., where they only charge $10. You might also consider traveling via Metro since there's a station nearby (Hollywood/Vine).Going to the theater, especially one as lovely as the Pantages, can be a wonderful experience. But it can also be an expensive one. However, that there are ways to enjoy the experience at a good deal - you just gotta look for them.One last word of advice if you're a frequent theatergoer: sign up for Audience Rewards to earn points and special bonuses that can be redeemed for free or specially-priced tickets at the Pantages, on Broadway, or at other venues throughout the country. You can earn points when you purchase season tickets, buy single tickets, test your knowledge playing trivia, and provide feedback on surveys. Good luck!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/944MO
40,Magnificent art deco theater,"The Pantages has to be seen to be believed. A true art deco masterpiece. The lobby and theater ceiling are incredible and beautifully restored. Go for a theater tour. Unfrotunately, I find it one of the worst theaters to see anything in Los Angeles. Terrible sight lines and the seating areas look like the entire city of Hollywood is sitting in front of you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler1063_12
50,Local Treasures,"The Pantages Theatre is a true architectural treasure packaging theatrical gems. Arrive early for parking and face your car toward an exit. Remember Los Angeles nights can get cold, even following warm days. Excellent for taking your kids or having a night out on the town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NKradjian
50,My Favorite LA Theater!,The best theater by far in Los Angeles! The art deco decor is amazing. The theater is small enough that there are very few bad seats in the house and the productions are always top notch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel72
50,Fabulous shows,"It is not Broadway yet many of the Broadway plays are shown here. The theater is beautiful, comfortable and inviting. I have never been disappointed and I am a Broadway theater fan. Even when the show is played in New York City simultaneously in here, the quality of the actors and performers is excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dresthercita
40,Place for Musicals,Beautiful place! I have watched pretty much 90% of my musicals here. Parking is expensive but if you are gonna drive you have no choice. One time we did take park our car at the Union Station and took the line that dropped us off right in front of Pantages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rookiemom
50,Beautiful theater!,"We've been season subscribers for years and love going to the Pantages, a truly beautiful theater with consistently good productions. We saw ""Peter Pan"" yesterday and smiled all the way home. Since the theater is big, one should take that into consideration when purchasing tickets. I recommend orchestra seating, no farther back than Row Y for the best viewing. The left or right side orchestra are good; although, if you sit all the way against the wall there will be some obstruction for anything on the far right or left side of the stage. There is no elevator, so if stairs are a challenge be sure to sit downstairs. There's a small handicap bathroom and the other bathrooms require 5-6 steps down and back up. We often see people in wheelchairs and the staff seems to be especially helpful in getting them to their seats or location. In fact, the staff are great - friendly and helpful always. Parking around the corner and across the street runs $10-15. There are lots of restaurants and a Starbucks within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC

50,Book of Mormon at the Pantages was fabulous,"My mother used to take me to the theater and the Pantages was one of my favorites. I hadn't been there for decades until recently when I saw the Book of Mormon. The building's architecture is Art Deco and was opened in the 1930's. In 2000 it underwent a massive restoration and it's new appearance is stunningly elegant. The Book of Mormon was the most irreverent and delightful play I have seen in years. It's a religious satire that aims at organized religion and traditional music theater. It tells the story of 2 young Mormon missionaries who are hopelessly out of touch with the villagers of their assigned location, Uganda. The villagers were far more worried about a brutal war lord, war, famine, poverty and AIDS then they were in being ""saved."" It is a wonderful production. But, listen to the music several times BEFORE you see the production. It will really help to understand the nuances. It's now playing in San Francisco and I am going to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Califia

50,Hooray for Hollywood,"If you are looking for a touch of the once amazing glamor of Hollywood you don't need to look any farther than the Pantages Theatre. We saw the Donnie & Marie Christmas show last night & it was a fabulous performance. Great sound system & the theater is maintained very well notwithstanding its age. The architecture of the theater, especially the ceiling & wall decor was from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Another reminder of its golden age are the stars on the sidewalk in front of the theater. Restaurants galore near the theater & an atmosphere that is uniquely Hollywood. A wonderful evening experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KahunaVentura_CA
50,A Pitch Perfect Hollywood Landmark,If you can catch a show at the Pantages DO! The interior is so amazingly breathtaking.

We just saw the Book of Morman here and had a wonderful time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PineappleShagette
40,Great place to see a show!,"Located right on the Hollywood Blvd walk of Fame, whatever is playing youll be seated in the heart of Hollywood. When the show is over you can stroll along the Walk of Fame. The theater is one of the nicest I have ever seen, very beautiful and decorative inside, and clean too! Could use more bathrooms though, there are long lines during intermission. Could use better food options, including more liquor selections, but hey you go for the shows not the eating. Great place! Always something fun happening around as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hidai

Only complaints are lack of bathrooms and not the best part of Hollywood Blvd. Would definitely go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassidyBayou
50,Must See! The Venue can Match any Show Played!!,The Pantages is a fully restored Art Deco theater in the heart of Hollywood. It is the best living example of the high point in the great glamorous period of early century Hollywood. The architecture is simply amazing and must be seen. To be able to see a great show as well is simply icing on the cake. Don't miss this experience if you are in hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kumstone

Of course, every season is filled with great shows (Book of Mormon is my favorite this season). Great for date night and for a fun time in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimmiep2000
40,Ornate Theater,"We just went and saw The Book of Mormon. With orchestra seats we had a great sight line. This theater is decorated in art deco, with brilliant colors and art works. They will not let you bring any type of open container into the auditorium, so you must consume everything before the show or during the 15 minute intermission. When we went last they did not sell any alcoholic beverages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcoder8
40,"Beautiful theatre, ample parking lots in the area, but only 1 bathroom for each gender!","This is more of an old-fashioned type of theatre with beautiful ceiling design and intimate space, as many reviews have already mentioned, ornate and stylish. But there's only 1 set of bathrooms for each gender and the seats are definitely tighter than even today's movie theaters. Parking is easy enough though, it was $20 for the evening. As someone who hates cigarette smoke, after intermission, it managed to seep into the theater and reeked for at least 15 min into the second act..but it either went away or you got used to it. I would certainly go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OtterDelight
40,Great Theater for Book of Mormon!,"The Pantages Theater is beautiful. Five friends and I actually managed to get seats together for the almost sold out Book of Mormon, which was fantastic. The seats were comfortable, the staff was friendly and out of the way, but best was the bathroom. I know this sounds silly, but I had to go during intermission, and when I saw that the line was over 40 people long, my jaw dropped. Though I stood in line, I was not confident I would make it in a stall by end of the 15 minute intermission. I was pleasantly surprised! Thanks to a large bathroom and an ""expediter"" aka a person that kept the line moving by assigning people's stalls when they were clear, I got in with 7 minutes to spare! I couldn't be happier. What a brilliant idea! My only complaint, and the reason for the missing 5th star, is how crazy hot it was in the theater. Maybe it was because we were in the first rows of the mezzanine, but I was expecting to be cold and brought a sweater, which I never wore. My husband was melting. But besides that, a very lovely night out to the theater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firecracker29
50,A big night,I enjoyed going to this theatre because you get a good play and yet you don't have to pay quite as much as if you were going to the large theaters. I saw many things there including Phamtom of the Opera. It was done quite good there and very exciting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddyone1
50,Terrific old theater,When you walk in you know right away it is a very special place. The lobby is ornate and the theater itself is cool as well. Try to sit in the orchestra seats; while they are a bit more expensive they are well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperiencedTravelers
40,Classic theater venue,"Well my experience started by parking in a $10 lot directly in front of the theater. I have never had an occasion where I park my car and hand my keys to a parking attendant so that was new. As I had hoped, when I returned everything was as I left it so no complaints there. The theater itself is a piece of art inside, absolutely stunning architecture. I suggest you get there as early as humanly possible. We showed up at the last possible second due to the fact we were on Hollywood blvd and lost track of time sight seeing. And doing so we were stuck in a monster crowd of people trying to fight their way to their seats. Sitting down I felt like no matter where you sit its a great view. We were there to see the ""Book of Mormon"" and it was fantastic. Part of that is always the venue and I have no complaints. But I did find that there was zero percent chance of using the restroom during the intermission unless I ran. The men's restroom had a line 15 people long so I gave up that hope. Wanting to view the merchandise I look to the main lobby for the booth only to find a sea of people that you couldn't put a piece of paper between. Both minor things that are overlooked as long as the main part of your experience was good. Which it was, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Pantages theater and would gladly return on the basis that they have a show that is not available to me in my area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mavkid17

40,Classic Hollywood,The theatre is so old and well maintained that it's an experience just to be inside it. The seats are all still very comfortable and the design is something you can marvel at in between acts. They're the only place in town where you can see Broadway shows like they are meant to be seen without the muss and fuss of the Music Center downtown. The Frolic Room next door keeps it authentic feeling as well and it's right across the street from the subway stop on Hollywood & Vine- could it get any easier?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiek884
40,"Nice, medium size theater","I like going to the Pantages to see plays and other performances. It's a more intimate venue, there's rarely a bad seat in the house and it's fairly easy to get to with plenty of parking. The parking near the theater is not cheap so be aware.They often have good musicals there and my family and I have seen many over the years. I've also seen a comedian or two at this same venue.Depending on the event, you can get cheaper tickets by not going to the Pantages website. Originally, I'd thought I'd find less expensive seats on their website. Not so. Even tickets on Ticketmaster were less expensive.In a spontaneous moment, a friend and I bought last minute tickets to a show (friday for a sunday performance) and even though our seats were not ideal, the price was right.Sign up for their email newsletter as they sometimes offer deals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinG32655
40,Pantages Theatre Facility,"This is a great theatre. The restrooms are a bit old fashioned, but the decor is art deco and amazing. The lobby is a grand setting. The theatre is well designed for both sound and sight lines. Parking is not easy, come early. You'll want time to relax and see the lobby. Sometimes you can get last minute tickets. Go to their website for info. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madmadeleine
40,Where they play the Broadway Musicals,"It's LA, so any theater you go to, you have the potential to see the next big production or the next IT star. But if you want to see a show that is currently hot on Broadway but can't make it to NYC, this is where to see it.Beautiful old theater with 3 or 4 bars that take credit cards. But just know that unlike theaters like the Ahmanson or the Mark Taper, you can't bring your drinks or snacks in, so don't buy too much in the lobby right before the show or else you'll be chugging it when they start flicking the lights.I brought a pair of binoculars because I sat in row X in the orchestra level. I kept checking them to see if I could see the faces better, but even from that distance I didn't need them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babbbles
50,Classic theatre with wonderful shows,"I've watched so many musicals there so far. They are great!the seating are actually mostly good even you sit at side, it's never too far from the stage imo. Of course, the closer the better.The inside looks classic with all the decorations and statues. Hmm though the souvenir purchasing normally requires a check or cash. But it's fine.Parking is a bit annoying though because you need to wait for the car to go out when the show is over, but guess that's just normal for most of the theatres.And again, love the theatre holding great shows, and many thanks to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaPetite
50,Great Venue,Super venue to see plays and concerts. If you're going to see and hear some music make sure you're not at the back on the lower level under the balcony. It's kinda boomey. Wonderful old theater. I recommend it highly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
40,"Saw Lion King, Bewitched, & P.O.T.O","Came here several times, nice theater. Parking sucks, but that's just typical for that area.

40,Beautiful Venue,"The Pantages Theater is a wonderful venue. It's a relatively small theater and I don't think there are any bad seats in the house. It's in the heart of Hollywood - which is a mixed blessing. Good restaurants around there, but also sketchy streets and neighborhoods. Easily reached by the LA subway - the stop is literally across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Where2GoWhere2go

40,Book of Mormon at the Pantages Theatre,"First off - the theatre is gorgeous! Every seat is a good seat and there are plenty of parking lots, reasonably priced, to park close by. We saw Book of Mormon this past weekend. With all of the hype, I was expecting to be wowed, but found it underwhelming. I guess my expectations were too high. I knew it was created by the South Park guys, that my 22 year old son thinks are hysterical, but I found the humor to be uncomfortably off color. I found myself shaking my head more times than I would have liked to. If you like raunchy humor, then you'll get a kick out of this show (the guy next to me was laughing his head off), but I guess I don't really enjoy that kind of humor. In fact, whenever my son had South Park on the TV, I usually left the room. That should have told me something. Live and learn...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAMom92082

50,Beautiful Old Hollywood Theater,This theater was built when Hollywood was more about movie stars and theater and less about the best clubs. It is absolutely gorgeous and a great venue for concerts and shows. Parking is close near by as well as many nice restaurants. We enjoyed coming to the theater today to see Steve Martin and will be happy to come back and see another show at this venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockNCreekGirl
40,Gorgeous restored theater,I've seen several Broadway road productions here. The theater itself is gorgeous and has been restores to it's original 1920's (?) glory.

The lobby and staircases are beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junnyd2018
20,Don't buy gift certificates,"My sister-in-law purchased two very expensive gift certificates from the Pantages via Ticketmaster. She then gave them as gifts to my wife and me. It turns out I have to drive to the theater to use the GIFT certificates. In my case, that is two hours round trip in traffic.I have asked my sister-in-law to get a refund. How sad in this day and age of automated websites and commerce. These folks are preserving a way of life that simply infuriates their customers, all the while doing this when expectations are being elevated by the eCommerce companies such as Amazon, Apple, etc., that do not require you to drive somewhere to use a gift certificate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9887FFdavidw

50,Wicked,"Been to this theatre before a long time ago and it was still beautiful!! This time I took my daughter to see Wicked and had a blast.The theatre is very, very beautiful and the people woking there are wonderful!If you live close enough, it is worth going to the box office for your tickets...it saved me about $100 over ticket master - just make a nice day of it with a lunch and you still save $$",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteH951

50,Always a place to enjoy a play,"This is a great theatre as the seating venue is fairly small. You won't feel like you are that far away from the stage. The only issue is parking. We go early and park on the street ( it is metered) go have a small dinner and then to the play. That way, we save the money on parking. There are not a lot of choices of where to eat since the only fine dining close by shut their doors several years ago. However, the ""pizza"" place across the street is fine and there is a chain Mexican ""take out type place"" several blocks down and up a side street.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fallcolors2

And they mount the best set of Broadway theater that you can find in LA.""Premiere"" has a double meaning in this review: We're season ticket holders, hitting several premiere events a year.

It has featured the Ramones and the Talking Heads. Now it features plays and musicals. The setting is so classic. It is so classic Hollywood that it just makes the show feel that much more special. When visiting, try to find a show at one of the many beautiful old theaters in this city-made-for-showbizz. This is one of my faves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624

10,Buyer Beware,"We attended The Pantages Theatre on May 5 for Billy Elliott. The play was fantastic! The theatre is lovely. The problem we had is that I had purchased two tickets using TicketMaster through the theatre's website. When we arrived at our seats, there was only one seat there. The other had been removed for a wheelchair. The house manager told me that those seats are only able to be purchased with a special code. When I told him I had not done that, he said since he wasn't there to see me at the computer, he couldn't verify that! He informed us that there were not any more seats in that price range and the only way we could stay was to pay an additional $120 for upgraded seats. Seriously? Since we had driven 80 miles, already paid for parking and it was my mom's 75th birthday, he was able to essentially blackmail me into paying more money to see a show for which I already had tickets. We were astounded by this appalling customer service. The Pantages blamed Ticketmaster for this mistake and Ticketmaster blamed the theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickyES

50,WOW!,"Visiting the city when we walked by this theatre and saw Rock of Ages on the marquee. We were able to get Row J tickets on the floor for $80 (it was 11 am the show was at 2 pm that day on a Saturday). We were impressed with the service at the ticket counter making sure we got the best seats available. The theatre itself was beautiful, old wood carvings, heavy velvet drapes, balcony seating, the whole bit. Seats couldn't have been better, close enough to see the spit flying from their mouth, but far enough away to be able to see the entire stage as this is an action packed dance show. The show itself was very entertaining, performers were excellent. A couple notes: while you can purchase alcohol, you can't bring it inside the performance area so if you are going to drink, get there earlier and finish in the lobby. Also, the picture nazis will be stalking you! There is a sign no photos can be taken, but that means even of another guest. I watched an usher make someone delete a photo of another patron off their phone. It wasn't even directed at the stage. It was quite amusing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasJA1

The location is good for easy freeway access and we find that we get in and out with not much difficulty. There is ample parking close by. The theater itself is very pretty in an old style. There is a bit of a shortage of nice restaurants nearby with your best bets being Larchmont Village or The Grove. If going to the Grove or somewhere beyond Hollywood & Highland make sure you are seated no later than 6:00 or you won't make 8:00 showtime.We saw ""Rock of Ages"" last weekend and it was excellent.

10,Dont get bad seats,"We went as a family of four; we paid around $110, 00 a seat. (Then $12 more per ticket that ticket master charges). Our seats were so bad for so many reasons. Aside from the fact that they were so far up that you can’t really see or hear anything well. The person beside me was a solid 500 pounds. His body spilled into half of my chair. I have nothing against large people. Just not fair, he should have bought two seats! I had very little room. The people around us would NOT stop talking during the show, and the ushers did not say a thing. People were coming in late, and they were seating them well into the first hour of the show. (Nothing like low impact aerobics to enhance the performance). The acoustics are terrible up there. Never mind the fact that the ""event"" cost the family $450.00.......I have complete utter buyers remorse! I'd like my money and my time back Pantages! You are ripping people off by letting them spend that kind of money to sit in seats where you can't, see or hear. At least have the common courtesy to have your ushers reprehend people if they are talking. AND I mean talking through out the entire show! BAD BAD evening what a waste of our time and money. I am sad for my two little girls. I wanted to give them a good experience to see a large Broadway production for the first time, and instead I had to apologize because they could not see or hear anything!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carriegggg

You could really appreciate the sound of orchestra during the performance and the voices of the performers really filled the room. As it is located on Hollywood Boulevard, I didn't feel safe during the walk home late at night which was the only downside.

50,Wicked,"One of the best parts of our trip to Wicked was the beautiful historical Pantages Theatre itself. The decor is amazing, and it was wonderful to sit in a theatre that has housed the Oscars, and seated so many Hollywood names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marciamc
40,"The show was 'WICKED"" good","My daughter-in-law, teenage granddaughter, and I went to the Pantages to see the stage show, ""Wicked"", as a holiday treat. The show itself was amazing, the singing was so strong and clear. I would see it again.The theater was nice, but I didn't like that there was a small souviner table, selling shirts, and stuff in the middle of the floor, and was diffucult stand around since people were trying to get past it, so I didn't get to buy something to remind me of the show. The bathrooms also were clean, and not very crowded, and the seats (mine was Orcastra-Y214) comfortable, and easy to see the stage, since every row is a little higher then the one on front. We loved it. Our home is 2 hours away, and the drive was okay on the LA freeways, but when you get to Hollywood, be on your best behavior, and have patience.The Hollywood area where the Pantages Theater is a total bottleneck. We parked in a parking lot less then a block away ($10.00) and walked that little way. That was pretty decient, but afterward, it was a madhouse, so keep your cool. The handy parking lot was not a jumble of 100's of cars all trying to get out at the same time, and then 100's of people crossing streets. I recommend the show highly, just be prepared to be very patient and you will get out of there without any problems or accidents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanski
50,Amazing Staff at the Pantages,"My girlfriend and I went to see Wicked a few days ago. We were in the center right orchestra section with good seats and just as the show started a smelly obnoxious couple sat next to us. They texted, talked, and actually shoved my elbow off my arm rest during the first half. We approached the usher who then radioed the theater manager. She completely understood our situation and moved us to center orchestra seats - better seats than we had. She was wonderful and very helpful and I can not say enough wonderful things about the staff at the Pantages. I've been twice and it's been wonderful each time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adam8881
50,Wickedly wonderful,"This was our first time to be at the Pantages Theater. Everything about our experience had the ""wow"" factor. The cast of Wicked were outstanding, the scenery wonderful, our seats were perfect, the orchestra equally perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanV980
40,Art Deco is never outdated !!!,"I visited the Pantages Theatre twice during this week and although I had been there before, this time I can tell why Art Deco is never outdated. My visit last week was to enjoy ""The Cure"" concert and last night I attended the opening of WICKED the musical. The Pantages Theatre's acoustics are phenomenal for either a concert or a play. The size of the Theatre is perfect because there is not a bad seat in the house. The mezzanine level has more comfortable seats (?) since the space between aisles is a little bit wider than Center Orchestra. The restrooms are well located and the bar in the center of the theater always provide an excellent service. I think that it's a wise idea not to let people take their drinks to their seats ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allertstar
40,Classic Art Deco style Theater,"The Pantages theater on Hollywood Blvd near Vine is the premier ""Theater"" venue in Los Angeles. Right in the heart of Hollywood, a 10 min walk from the Hollywood Highland complex.If you are coming from downtown or the valley, take the Red Line subway, it drops you off right across the street. Subway tickets cheaper then the parking in the area.The theater is beautiful inside, classic art deco style.Seating has good sightlines until you get way over to the sides, avoid these seats!Bathrooms get crazy crowded during intermission, be quick or hold it till after.Refreshments available in lobby, but a theater prices. I prefer to wait until after, and then hit one of the numerous eateries in the area. Or get there early and eat beforehand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gordon58
40,Take notice of the details on the inside of this theater!!!,"We went to see Beauty and the Beast at this theater. When I walked into the lobby, I stood there and just stared at the ceiling. Also, the staircase was beautiful to look at.The downside to this theater was that it didn't offer enough steepness to its seating. I've been to other theaters, and the seats were steep enough so you can see over the row in front of you - your view is not obstructed at all. However, here at Pantages Theater, I could not see the show. I had to sit crookedly to be able to sneak a peek past the couple in front of me. And if either one of them moved, I had to readjust. Now sitting like that for the duration of the show made me quite grumpy.Other than that, my experience there was wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BAKER67
50,Great Theatre,I have been to a half dozen theatres on Broadway and The Pantages was nicer than all of them combined. This is truly a first rate venue. Don’t hesitate to see a show there if you get the chance!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravens4ever
40,An Experience Worth Having,"We saw “Wicked” at the Pantages and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The building is historic, very well restored and impressive. We sat in the mezzanine towards the back of the first section near the center. The view of the stage and sound were both excellent for the play. Parking is available in a surface lot, catty corner from the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/basicgrandpa
40,Evening at Pantages Theater,"The Pantages Theater is a beautiful theater. Parked across the street at the Sunshine Parking lot. I had gone to their website and printed a $1 off coupon. Parking at the lot is $8, however, they would not take the coupon. I had talked to someone the week before and they told me about the coupon, but the guy refused to honor it. We intended to have dinner at Hollywood and Vine (next door to Pantages), however we found them to be closed down. Fortunately, there was a lady standing there on the corner, handing out fliers to a restaurant across the street called ""Honey"". It turned out to be a very nice place with good food. So, my suggestion is to have a dinner place in mind and to call them beforehand to verify that they are open. Nearby, you'll mainly find bars, tatoo shops and t-shirt shops. The Pantages theater is very nice, and big. We sat in the first section of the balcony, and found the seats to be very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer909
40,Been here many times....It's really big...,"I have seen Miss Saigon, Producers and a few other shows.. I can't remember... Many of the shows that are on Broadway come to the Pantages... Each show was great but the theatre is not like Brodway ones because it runs pretty deep... If yopu are going to buy orchestra seating, you need to buy in the mid to upper alphabet becaus it goes back far and if you are short like me, then you have a hard time seeing.. I usually prefer to pay for what savailable in the mazenine seating...I have heard that the restaurant next to the pantages very good, I love Yamashiro which is is an asian fusion restaurant with a very pretty view of LA befor ei go to see a show. It is very expensive though... SOme other options in LA with more affordable dinng that are yummy would include Hamburger Hamlet, Grand Lux, and Lolas has a great martini bar....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babyboo999
50,The gem of our journey!,"On a grownups only vacation, we were seeing the sites in Hollywood. As we turned the corner, I saw a marquis advertising ""The Producers."" I had been dying to see this, and even better the main roles we3re played by Jason Alexander and Martin Short. On a long shot we decided to see if there were any tickets for that evenings performance. There were!!!We had no idea as to what was inside the theater. We had never even heard of the Pantages Theatre. As we went inside, the amazing decor caused our jaws to drop as we gaped up at the ceiling and the second floor. This theater has a wonderful ""old Hollywood"" feel to it. The musical was also fantastic, Short and Alexander personally addressed the audience at the end.This, in our humble opinion, should be a must see location and musical.This is the top of our favorites in the LA area!You must go here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freedom5310
