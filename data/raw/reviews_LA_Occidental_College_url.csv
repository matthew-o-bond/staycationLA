40,Small College in Center of LA,"We visited this campus as part of my daughter’s SoCal college tours.It was a small, private campus situated in the middle of a residential neighborhood. The campus has a nice layout with classrooms centralized around a big plaza like area. It was quiet on this weekend morning but our guide told us it gets livelier when the students wake up or if we came back during the weekday.Most of the buildings were well maintained with modern classrooms. Some, like the library, was a bit old school with very formal sitting areas, rows of books on dark wooden bookcases, desk lamps, etc. Also here was the first “shrine” to President Obama, who attended Occidental. We were told there were two on campus as they were quite proud of having President Obama as a past student.There were lots of open areas on campus to hang out along with a soccer field and soon to be finished aquatics building and tennis courts for those athletically inclined. It was an easy walk but some areas like the Choi auditorium and Career Center were up a slight incline as the college was situated on the side of a small hill.Parking was free for everyone which was quite unusual for a college in LA.The Marketplace was a top rated cafeteria which was also known for its Vegan offerings. There also was a coffee shop which was owned and operated by the students where a class offered credit for their entrepreneurial experience running the business.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wireless_in_CA
