30,hispanic street festival around the last weekend in april,"So this outdoor street festival typically takes place on the last weekend of april. Its pretty easy to get to from the la metro simply get off at the pershing square stop and broadway is just the street over.I tend to like coming here to see what freebies are offerred to the hispanic community you can find typical things like free health care screenings, cutrate drivers insurance, other times i've seem promotions for airlines for flights down south.Usually i can find interesting freebies for the community at large they had quite a few booths with the latest movies coming out and this time they offerred small posters of upcoming movies like the new star wars movie (hans solo).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
