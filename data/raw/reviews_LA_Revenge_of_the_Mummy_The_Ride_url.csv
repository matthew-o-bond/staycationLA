40,This is a fun roller coaster that I'll always ride when visiting Universal Studios Hollywood.,"This is a fun roller coaster that I'll always ride when visiting Universal Studios Hollywood.The Mummy movie Theme is propped well at the beginning and the stopping point of the ride. You don't see it for long because after you turn the corner you are shot into the pitch dark track. You're traveling at high speed in total darkness except for a few mummy light props until you reach a stopping point. From there, you travel backwards at high speed down the rollercoaster back to the loading area. This is a very short but exhilarating and entertaining roller coaster.FYI. You'll have to stash your backpacks, bags, etc in the free lockers at the ride line entrance. Since the ride is so short, the rider turnover is very quick. Every time I visited with an Express Pass, I literally just walked right up into the loading area. Fantastic. Highly recommended and don't forget that Express Pass. Enjoy!",Steff A
50,Loved it!,"The Revenge of the Mummy ride was very exciting, the seats were not too small at all and they were very comfortable. The Harry Potter area was beautiful we had a delicious meal at the 3 Broomsticks restaurant there.",Janiehanneman
50,Fun themed dark coaster with a lot of excitement,"The mummy Coaster was a highlight of our Universal experience. The 4D rides are cool, but a good roller coaster is more up my alley, especially with great theming like Universal and Disney are known for. From fire and fast turns to sudden drops and even thematic acting by the crew, this ride will be one you try again and again!",tslone81
50,Good rollercoaster,This can be a busy ride so try to make it one of your first to avoid queues! Good rollercoaster with lots of different things happening,Duerds5
40,"Very quick ride, very good drops, visuals a bit dated in 2019","Very good ride, but as the title says the actual visuals need updating compared to Harry Potter the Forbidden Journey. Was a 25 minute wait on the single rider line. This was a bit later in the day so it may be worth going at that time of day. It`s pretty dark, which added to the experience, for me at least.",Matt S
40,a fun and fast ride,"The lower lot at Universal does not open until 1000AM, so go on the Simpsons ride while you wait. On the second day, they did let people go down a little bit early.They provide a free locker service, where you can store your larger bags and backpacks while going on the ride. The single rider line does move somewhat fast during peak times.This is a fun ride, so hold on tight! We rode it 3-4 times a day.",iceman68
50,A fast ride,"If you don't mind wating it worth it ,a very fast ride in the dark spinning you around and around making you feel sick good if you like that sort of thing .",christine r
50,What a ride!,A very scary ride you shouldn't miss! It's an indoor roller coaster in total darkness and you cannot see anything!! Just awesome!,mrtgo
50,Way fun !!,"This ride really has nothing to do with the movie other than the general Egyptian theme, but that doesn’t lessen the fun. Ride is way too short - I’m guessing maybe 45 seconds, max.",James W
40,Mummies!,This is basically an indoor roller coaster ride that also takes your car BACKYARDS at unexpected moment. A lot of it is in the dark but the mummy and sand and other spooking things are all around. Great fun if you are a Mummy fan....and you never know which way you will go - !,Elizabeth G
50,Awesome ride,I love the Mummy movies and always wanted to get on this ride. It lived up to the hype. It is a rollercoaster but has a few tricks up its mummified sleeves. Good fun!,daswifty
50,So Much Fun,"This is a great indoor roller coaster. I wasn't expecting a ride photo so be prepared. I love The Mummy movies and this ride is perfectly based on Imhotep. Just an FYI it does go backward, I wasn't prepared for that. But, I would ride it over and over again.",Ashley Mantras
50,Another Great Ride,"We loved this ride if you loved the Mummy Movies you will really enjoy this ride , it is full on Thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge but you cant stop laughing all the way through the ride, Very enjoyable",Brian J
50,Intense ride!,"This ride is so much more intense than what we'd expected it to be. It's an indoor thrill ride that's based on ""The Mummy"" movies. It brings the excitement and fun of those movies along with heart pounding thrills around every turn. The line wasn't that bad. We waited about 30-40 minutes.",0221Serendipity
50,Most fun ever,My son and went on this ride and laughed the entire time. It is a very thrilling ride that goes both ways. And you can purchase your picture at the end of the ride. Which is totally worth it.,Shane S
50,Awesome but too short,"Previously I rode this ride twice in Orlando and I decided to ride it again except in Universal Studios Hollywood. It was really freaking awesome and had everything I thought I would expect until it stopped at half the basic ride time it had been in Universal Studios Orlando. I'd still recommend this ride, but only if you're prepared for it to end so soon.",Luke G
50,Amazing fun!!,Amazing rollercoaster! Never felt acceleration like it.A must for when visiting universal studios Hollywood.,Kim
10,The Mummy is dead,"Much like Brendan Fraser's acting career (as of now), this ride was basically sad. Down one direction, then take you backwards through wence you came. I need some scarabs or something to get me going.",Andrew B
50,Classic ride,"This is a really nice ride, and although it has been there over 10 years, it still is really good. If there is a long queue, a good trick is to use single rider line :)",DjJassu
40,Good fun ride.,My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this one. She is not a fan of big fast rollercoasters so this suited us well. Most of it was in darkness which was creepy. good intro scenes leading up the ride too.,Steve_In_Ulster
40,Very good ride,Revenge of the Mummy - The Ride is a good ride with a roller coaster increasing and decreasing speed almost instantly.,AntoNic7
50,One of the best rides there!,Ride this ride! It's fun and thrilling and there's some thrilling surprises along the way! Fun for teens and older kids!,Addie R
30,Not for the faint hearted,"The most terrify ride I've been on. Was so pleased when it was over, literally had tears in my eyes. Some people will love it if they are thrillseeks, but for me this is an extreme ride.",Ero40
