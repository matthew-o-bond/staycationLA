50,What a day out...,"I was invited to the LA county fair, and only ever having been to one before (Georgia) had to accept. We knew it was going to be a hot day, the weather forecast predicted something like 103 degrees.When we got there my first impression was ""Wow"". It is huge, noisy, buzzing, and the smell from the different food vendors was something else. So park up, walk to the entrance, and then an assault on the senses. Wild West show, Country Dancing, more varieties of food thatn I can remember.It was a long day, lots of walking and plenty to see and do. I liked the halls with different vendors in. Had a few freebies, bought a few things, plenty to eat and drink. I could have quite happily kept walking round for hours, as each time I turned a corner, there was something new to see.It was a great day out, Thoroughly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surveyor47
40,Can be an Expensive Day,"Had not been to the LA County Fair in years, but wanted to go back and check it out. It turned out to be one of those 90+degree days, and the air conditioned pavilions were a great break from the weather. I enjoyed seeing all the artwork and collections presented by the school children. Great talent.The cost of parking and admission was reasonable, but the food and drink cost was pricey. Luckily, I had done my research and knew that some of the food vendors offered a special value meal option. This was not well advertised, but was a perfect option. I don’t think many people were aware of this meal option.If you like fair rides there were tons and the cost was reasonable. That being said, I could see how a family could easily drop a few hundred dollars when you total everything up.It was a fun afternoon, and will go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621seanz
50,What a great experience!,First time at a county fair as I am Canadian !Loved the varied food the colourful rides and displays!So much to see and do!Be sure you take lots of cash!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
30,Not what it used to be.,"My pictures show the best things about this years fair. Nowadays they don’t advertise much and it’s getting to be a chore even for the organizers to feign interest. Still a great place for fun and games; unfortunately, fairs like these seem out of touch with the changing times. I hope they improve for the years to come because I don’t want to see the LA County Fair go away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romplep
30,Working the Fair,"While working at the Fair, I have met some very interesting people. some were very inquisitive about Pomona and the Fair. Some were lost and needed directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/da1tazerman
50,Be ready to spend $,"Came through with the fam, great time. Come prepared to spend some money, 16oz icee with souvenir cup is $8. King taco 3 burritos + nachos $40 parking $15 or $25 for VIP - $12 for adult entry $8 for kids ages 6-12 - wristband for unlimited rides $50 - 100 tickets for $50 each game cost around 12-16 tickets each so it goes fast. Just come prepared especially if you have a family. Other than that a great time. Great event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IfAndyCantHelpYou
40,Lots to see & do,"The pluses include so many happenings at this event. There are many rides to keep one occupied. Examples of animals to see are the Budweiser Clydesdales, pigs at the races, cows during milking demonstrations & families of sheep. A section of locomotives is present for those that are train buffs. A variety of other things are on display from older videogames to stands selling spa hot tubs. Pitbull was scheduled to make an appearance on 09/01 but had to cancel due to Hurricane Dorian. George Lopez was present on Labor Day and could be seen for additional charge. The fair is open until 10 P.M. on slower days & midnight on weekends through the rest of the summer (Closed Tues.). There is a ton of food to consume here including turkey legs & fried fruit. That leads to the big minus: Prepare to spend a lot of $. Going price for the turkey is $14.75+; a Lg. Watermelon Limeade $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/locke869
10,it's a carnival not a fair,"this is more of a carnival than a fair.what happen to bake offs ,dress making, best vegetables everything a fair should be.sure they have a parade on the weekends and plenty of vendors to sell you things you do not really need. But in general this is not a County Fair it is a Carnival.someone really needs to revamp this fair thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wpf736
50,SCC CAAEYC Day at the Fair,A good reminder that adults need playtime as well young children......a visit to the LA County Fair can take care of this need.Fun will he had by all....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327franc
20,Not the way it use to be,"LA County Fair use to be fun and exciting with all the awesome fried food and new gadgets the vendors had. We spent the weekend there and I have to say, we will not be back next year. The food is ok but the menu needs some upgrading and changing. Definitely needs some “kicking it up a notch or two!” Why should my family come back for the same food over and over again? At least add to the menu. It was also hotter than.... and the water vendors that use to have complimentary little cups of water are gone! That was actually a nice touch to keep customers hydrated to enjoy the fair. The other major issue is, the vendors are very aggressive and plain rude! On Saturday, this acupuncture guy touched my husband’s shoulder w/o warning, telling my husband to try their chair massage. My husband said no and continued to say “don’t touch me.” The guy stepped to the side and while I was walking right behind my husband witnessing all these, the same guy comes behind me and puts his hands on my shoulders and starts to pinch me! I yelled at him to stop and to not touch me! We didn’t come to the fair to be assaulted! Then today, my son cut across the ATT area to go see another vendor, I follow him and the guy from ATT said “this is a private area you cannot cut across!” He was not kidding. I said I didn’t know your area was private. He said “I paid x amount for this area....” we are totally done w/ the LA County Fair. It’s suppose to be a family time of relaxation, spend money shopping and making a quick vacay out of it. We make it a point to stay at the Sheraton Hotel just to enjoy the fair but we just said good bye to the LA County Fair. The only thing we liked was ADT people Cassandra and Erica were very helpful in getting us upgrade our system. And no, we were not approached aggressively, I saw the ADT sign and we went to them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5323DQjennifers
50,Family time,Purchased season tickets so we could enjoy opening day and beyond.Loved the pop menus for $6.50. We attended several days so far and each day we find something new.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alot4
30,Fun but Not a Great Value. Rides Cost an Arm and a Leg,"We went to the fair with young kids, mostly to go on thrill rides. LA County Fair wasn’t a good value for our goals. Wish we would have gone to Knott’s Berry Farm instead.Beware that if your children are between 42-48 inches, for thrill rides they will need a parent to accompany them. One adult per child of this height. These kinds of rides cost 12–16 tickets, and tickets are $0.50 each. If you plan to go on rides, the unlimited rides wristbands are a better value ($50) than purchasing individual tickets. You can’t buy wristbands after 9 on weekdays. On weeknights you can’t use wristbands after 7pm. You can buy Knott’s Berry Farm tickets for $54-58 and park is open til 11pm.Fairgrounds were clean and there was a variety of carnival foods to enjoy. But the prices of the rides and restrictions on use of wristbands really turned me off. Will be finding another amusement park for our kids next summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jvB299QN
40,Better than the VC fair!,"Had a great time at the LA CO Fair so much more to see. Nd do them my hometown fair! Make sure to check out their discount days. Fun for date night didn’t even get on any rides just shopped, drank, and danced the night away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jemmiej2019

40,Who doesn't like the fair,Not much into the rides or the games anymore but enjoy the day/night out wandering around the grounds. We enjoy walking through the merchandise buildings and picking up some unique items. Also plenty of good/interesting food to enjoy. We like to go on when they have a concert we want to see at night. Good shows at a decent price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalbadger
20,LA County Fair working backwards now.,"Staff or cops don't help navigate traffic when its time to leave, so cars are cutting off each other and even pedestrians. No more water stations or free water bottles like they used to. Rides and food are over-priced!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6983PCgustavom
50,Lots of fun!,Loved all of the tributes to Route 66 and everything California at the fair. The food was outrageous as expected. I enjoyed some deep fried Oreos. There are plenty of rides and games for kids of all ages. The expo halls are also filled with lots of stalls and displays. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y415IZmichellen
50,Great fun day for all ages!,"Great concert venue, lots of great rides and tons of savory food and things to buy! We saw the Kool & the Gang and KC & the Sunshine band concert which was great. But there were several other concerts I would have also loved to have gone to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526pattys
20,2018 save your money and go to knotts berry farm because the fair is expensive and nothing more,"Yes you can get a discount to get in. But you pay for parking and let me be clear every ride and game cost...alot. on average rides were on average 12 tickets a ride and tickets are 50cent a piece with the minimum purchase 5 dollars or 10 tickets, so plan to spemd 20$ becuase 10 tickts won't buy a game or ride and 20 will get you on 1 ride or game with not enough to do anything more withGames cost a minimum of 12 tickets and get this. No gaurenteed prizes for kids.most games arw hard to win anything so thats a waste of money.My special needs daughter who is uncomfortable on rides basically couldnt even win a prize for teying her hand at a gameMost of the food was just okay. Ive had better at the 626 night marketMost of the exibition halls had small businesses selling junk. And there were tons of mattresses and spas thats about itOverall. We spent 150$ and didnt get much for it.Ill pass next year. Save more amd head to knotts. Where the rides are free and food is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimcclenton1
40,Fair Fun!,"There’s two days left to enjoy this year’s L.A. County Fair. GO!I really want to give the Fair organizers major points for taking the Route 66 theme and giving it the most amazing treatment! It is very impressive. I really can’t think of anything they missed. Plus, where else are you going to be able to get a picture of you standing IN the “HOLLYWOOD” sign and have the entire thing fit in the frame? Okay it’s a replica but hey, you’re still close enough to Hollywood to make it count!The Fine Arts building has some major Insta worthy photo ops and it’s a fun walk through. You can even become a cactus!Go in the late afternoon into evening, it’s a lot better to catch it as the sun winds down rather than rising. My top tips to enjoy any Fair are to pass on all the deep fried crap (ok maybe allow one since it’s the Fair, but any more and you’ll likely regret it later), bypass the animal exhibit unless you have little ones (it’s smelly and depressing to see them penned, at least to me), and take pictures of the carnival at night! Wear comfortable shoes, apply sunscreen, and bring water.It really is a great Fair this year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethw591
40,Sunday So Crowded,"This year we took our granddaughter on Sunday the 16th. We bought our tickets at Albertsons on Bonita in La Verne before we went to the fair. $24.00 for two adult tickets and our five year old grand was free. They gave us two coupons for ride wristbands at $37.00 each. Parking was $15.00. The rules on the LA County Fair state that you can bring in drinks and snacks in a 12 x 18 (maximum size) cooler. NO GLASS. No open containers. No alcohol of course. I had a small cooler in our stroller with sealed water bottles and two cans of iced tea. I also had three thermos type containers which had ice cubes in them. Going thru the security, we were told that we could not take in the canned iced tea. Either we were to turn them in to security or take them back to our car. Hubs took them back to our car. When he finally got back, another security officer said that we could have poured the cans of iced tea into our containers of ice. Hmmm, now why didn't the first security officer say we could do that? It was very inconvenient and the rules listed on the website page were different than what was actually enforced at the gate. We got in and used our ride wristband coupons right away which cost $74.00 for two wristbands (as opposed to $100.00 for two)… Our grand was able to ride quite a few rides and was only denied on one because their 'measurement' thing was inaccurate and they said she wasn't tall enough... Tall enough for many other rides requiring the same height but this one ride said no... Hmmm... As to the food,,, we saw a lot of advertising before going that there would be food priced at $6 supposedly because of Route 66... we didn't see any food places that offered anything that low in price... we got a very dry roast beef on a bun ($12.00), order of fries (really good) ($6.00), and a coke in a refill cup ($3.00) for a total of $21.00... Later we got ice two ice cream cones (soft serve) and a small bottle of pomegranate water and that was $15.50. We always love going thru the buildings to see the exhibits and the vendors and all that there is to look at but it seems like if you go thru one vendor building, you've seen it all. Each vendor building has the same thing, and most are not cheap. The exhibits were good, especially the arts and crafts. The animals were a lot of fun. My biggest negative tho is how easy it is to get alcohol at the fair. There are far too many of those places there... Otherwise, we had a good time. We arrived at 10 AM and left at 7 PM. Long day among a whole lot of people. It started out reasonable but around 5 PM it started getting really crowded... Do we recommend the Los Angeles County Fair? Heck yea. Will we go again? Definitely. We have gone every year for the last 40 years plus...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninee

Walked through all the buildings, saw all the animals, went to the Pig races, saw the Garden Railroad, saw the bee colony, saw all the great fountains around the park. Saw the Clydesdale Horses for the very first time in my life. Got to see the train museum and all the trains for the very FIRST time....AWESOME!!!! The Acrobat show was AMAZING!!!

We went for 8 years in a row from the time my kids were itty bitty until they were teens. Go on a weeknight when there is a canned food drive for free admission, buy the wrist bands for endless rides...it's worth it if you're going to be there for several hours. Try ALL the weird food, walk through the halls to take a break from the heat and make sure to explore all the far reaching corners past the exhibition buildings...there is always more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyK13626
50,THE BEST County FAIR period,LA County fair is the largest county fair in the USA..OVER 700 Acres including the parking area..The sites the sounds the rides.

A petting zoo with lots of animals and space to walk around and take pictures.Be prepared to be on your feet all day as there's not much seating and lots to see. Alot of food stalls from bugers, hot dogs BBQ's etc.I would recommend for couples, families and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9443VHjasonl
30,"A HUGE Fair, but parking a NIGHTMARE !!","I attended this fair for the first time on 09-23-17 (Sa), mainly to see the Chicago concert. The concert was great, the merchandise buildings were fine, and the food was terrific but overpriced.But the parking situation is TERRIBLE. The traffic on the streets nearby crawls at a snail's pace, and there is very little coordination of it from the police/authorities. All totaled, it took me about 90 minutes to get from the freeway exit into the fair parking lot. Also, by the time I got out of my car, it was VERY dark, but most of the lights in the parking lot were not even on yet. (They were on when walked back to my car later that night, which means they came on sometime, but why not turn them on as it is GETTING dark rather than an hour or two AFTER it gets dark?)One other issue is the number of people at the fair made walking around VERY difficult; it was like the Las Vegas strip on New Years Eve at times, wall to wall people. Whoever designed the grounds was not thinking much, because the buildings are too close together leaving too little room for people to walk between them.But hey, Chicago was tremendous as always !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sierrapaul
50,"""Largest fair ever""","Wow!, what a fair! By far the largest fair that I've ever seen. From, rides for everyone, farm animals, crafts and displays in numerous buildings. Vendors set up outside to enjoy. Food: you name it, you can get it! You could even take a skylift and see all of the fair from above. Igloos in LA? You betcha! And even a Ice skating rink on the inside. Take your time and spend the day. We loved it!😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoop35311
50,Best Fair In Socal! Visit Annually!,"We love going to the LA County Fair which I've now visited almost every year since I moved here nearly 10 years ago. There is a TON to do and many available discounts to meet your needs if you do some research online.There is a large selection of carnival rides and games for kids and adults alike. The barnyard area has SEVERAL different sections with what seems like endless displays of goats, sheep, horses, cows, chickens, roosters, rabbits, and more! There are also many different sections throughout the fair with additional animal exhibitions that are all free to see including a Zoo area and bee keeping area. There is the section of the fair that are seller exhibitions... and they literally have over 7 giant buildings with this type of stuff. There is the food which you can imagine... literally any type of food you want, you can find it somewhere. There is even a Vegan booth with AMAZING vegan food (only one of those though). Tons of entertainment and other stand alone things to explore.It's not a cheap day... Even if you find a discount or cheap ticket to enter you're going to pay $15 for parking and your food and rides aren't going to be cheap. But it's a fun, seasonal thing to do. If you are planning on going on a LOT of rides, I would consider some of the specials where you get an all-inclusive bracelet that gives you unlimited tickets. I did that one year and we literally went on almost everything!If this were a Fair back east, I'd probably give it 4 stars as it lacks the whole ""Autumn"" theme I generally like in Fairs. I used to frequent The Topsfield Fair every year in Topsfield, MA and the whole autumn imagery of pumpkins, apples, apple cider, etc can't be found here... That said... this is as close as it's going to come in socal and if it's ""as good as it gets"" in an area, then it deserves 5 stars.Not to be missed! Great fun for the whole family or a perfect date outing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Great For Kids And Adults,"We go at least once a year. My daughter and her friends love the rides. My wife loves the gardening tips and animals. I love the food. Who knew you could fry so many things. We enjoyed cajun food and beignets at Harold and Belle's stand on the walk by Building 5. Yum! Also, there was ice skating in Bldg. 9. That was fun and very cool on a warm late summer afternoon. Also, in market place next to plant displays in the Atrium, they serve hundreds of gold medal winning wines and delicious olive oils. This is a must see place this year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveler0109
40,La county fair fun,"I have not been to the fair more than 8 years. We decided to go this year on a Friday. Somebody told me to go to Costco because they had a special. 4 admission tickets, parking, and 44 rides and games for only for $60.00. But if you go get the discount of limited rides because it get expensive with kids. At the fair the waistband is $50.00, but if you go to online or market it will be $37.00.There was so much traffic trying to get into the main street of the fair. But the parking ticket is on white street in the lot #9. When we got to the entrance i wanted a map, no luck.My kids had so much fun because there were lots of rides and games. My husband got hot dog that was huge, but he said it did not have any taste. I got a bbq pull pork sandwich that was great. Everything was really expensive. There was a petting Zoo, kid zone, and a lot more. We were tried after walking so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chela9992503
50,Best Fair In Ca,"This is the most fun fair in Ca. I highly recommend staying at the Sheraton Fairplex. As a guest of the Hotel, you get a private fair entrancewith no line. The fair has typical rides, Clydesdales, great concerts, gold medal wine and beer tasting , great food and it is family oriented",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6289OFchrish
30,A nice outing,"It’s been a while since I went to the fair. We purchased $12 admission tickets at a participating market (listed on discounts web page), which also printed a $37 coupon for rides wristband. For parking, we paid full price. First thing we purchased after entering was a coupon book for $5. It came with a complimentary admittance ticket, valid Wed-Fri, and a spin for a coupon that can be used outside the fair.Spending over nine hours, we took our time and walked all over the fairgrounds. This was my first time going to the farm. The typical farm animals were on display as well as the petting zoo (there are wash station upon exit). The chicken coops shown were quite stunning. What both of us enjoyed most were the demos. We learned how to make whip cream, butter, and ice cream. The blacksmith created the tail of a seahorse in front of us and we received a small sample of soap from Markham Farm. At the end of the day, we returned and purchased bars of soap and a jar of honey (where you can see bees hard at work).In the exhibition buildings, I was surprised to see the same vendor multiple times. Many of these salespersons were quite ""persistent"" to our annoyance. We purchased a pair of green gel shoe insole for $25. My boyfriend immediately used them. Within two hours, the seam on the right sole broke. We went back and got it replaced effortlessly. This vendor was located in building 9. I only wish I remembered their name.The food was just as expensive as the games and rides. Zucchini curls at Chicken Charlie's was a huge disappointment. A big wad of grease, the zucchini was limp and the only texture came from the coating it was fried in. I threw more than half of it away.Although we passed by all three After Ice cream (at double the price of their retail shops) locations, we opted for Olde Tyme Ice Cream. Only the plain vanilla bar was freshly dipped. The cheesecake was coated in Oreo crumbs. I could tell this was prepared ahead of time and frozen because there was ice between the cheesecake and chocolate coating. This was more cumbersome to eat as the cookies fell off and it was an awkward shape.The bowl of fried rice topped with orange chicken at Eddie's Asian Cuisine was typical Chinese fast food. I received several pieces of flour only, no chicken. The triple decker Krispy Kreme burger at Chicken Charlie's only had cheese between each patty and bookend with donuts. My boyfriend was the only one who ate this and he enjoyed every bite.Overall, it was nice day spent at the fair. It's something to look forward to every couple of years. Next time, I'll look at what the food vendors are offering before stepping on to the fairgrounds. Don't want to miss out on more appealing menus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/va70aux
30,Loved the heroes discount,"Parking $15 bucks. It's heroes week so my husband and I got into the fair for $2.00 a piece. Every year it seems like there is less and less exhibits and stuff like that. However there is a huge amount of carnival games and rides. And don't bother getting the souvenir cup this year. The lids are so cheAp that they pop right off. What's the deal?It was a Thursday so it was not crowded.Overall, if it wasn't for the entrance discount, I would not have went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dany0802
40,1st Timers,"My Husband and I missed the OC Fair this year and decided to go to the LA Fair since we had never been. I was able to find a good deal on Groupon for the entrance fee which made me that much Happier to not pay full price. We went on opening Day and were surprised at how lonely it was, then again the weather was 112 degrees so it makes sense. I was delighted at the size and food options they offer. We went to see the Wonderland, A Floral Fairytale and it was really cute with the Alice in Wonderland theme. Also, got to see the animals and was able to feed a Giraffe. We will definitely be back next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCali91
30,Our Yearly Visit,"We went on Labor Day this year so we didn't get the senior discount. $30.00 for two seniors entrance, and 4 year old granddaughter was free admittance. The rides are expensive so we get the wristbands, unlimited rides, for $50.00 each. So for our granddaughter and grandpa, that was $100.00 more. Surprisingly it wasn't crowded, and it wasn't hot. It was however on the humid side tho. It was difficult to find anyone serving a cup of coffee. After awhile of rides and looking around, we stopped for a waffle thingie. One of those with nothing on it, plus an iced tea was $18.00. We did find a place by the petting zoo that had coffee and it was wonderful. Our little one had a blast on the rides. Overall she rode about twelve rides. Grandpa rode with her twice. The fair makes money on the wristbands ! At about 1, we stopped at Juicys Cowboy Grill for lunch. We got one western sausage, one mountain of fries, one kids meal, and one water. That cost $40.00. The kids chicken nugget and waffle fries were good, but the rest wasn't. The sausage tasted like rubber and made both hubs and I sick to our stomachs within 20 minutes. The mountain of fries were greasy and cold and hard. Those went straight to the trash, as did most of the sausage and breading. I realize that these vendors need to make money but the prices are truly very high considering what one has to pay to park, admission to fair, and ride tickets/wristbands. We always go to the fair at least once a year. I can't see how many of the families with several kids can afford to go and enjoy themselves. We were there for about nine hours. The exhibits were very nice. The vendor booth with all the russian nesting dolls was great. The fair is a lot of fun but just too expensive. Do we recommend? Oh heck yea ! Will we go again? Every year !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninee

Even the horse racing has disappeared. If you like a home show and midway rides, this is the place, if you are looking for a county fair, look elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenpM552WO
40,"Save some money using different methods to save,","The costs of the food was totally outrageous. $10 for a burger and $4 for a water seems a little over the top. The overall experience of seeing the animals and displays were great .next year, I would stop and pick up food and drink to take in . look online to get discounted entry tickets using the different city days tickets . you can get reduced entry tickets for $5 that way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/realtorcraig
10,Not Bagging the Fair Here But....................,"We Wanted to go to the NHRA hall of Fame Museum and Unfortunately wanted to do it whilst the fair was on. As we were holidaying from Australia we just didn't know. We just wanted to see the NHRA museum. well what a battle. Idiot at the gate told us it would cost $15 to park then we could go through the fair and go to the museum. we reluctantly paid this and parked only to find it would cost us and $14 each to get into the fair to get across to the Museum. what a lot of Bull....., there should have been some provision for people wishing to go to the museum only. so we go back to the car drive back to the idiot on the gate to get our $15 who tells me its not refundable. instead of belting him I just asked for a supervisor. Idiot 2 didn't want to give me my money but I was not moving until he gave it to me. I am sure the fair is very good so not knocking that. but wake up you idiots and provide an option for the museum during this fair. we will never have another opportunity to go there again. NOT impressed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561JeffM561
20,Fair,Not much change from previous years. Food overpriced and not enough seating in shades areas for elders. Restroom maintenance understaffed for females.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cr8nheat
50,Better every year,"The exhibits are especially good this year the vendors are as always prevalent with full on things you can't live without so bring extra money the food is, well, it's fair food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csimmamps
20,Crass Carnival,"The LA County Fair was originally developed to showcase California`s agricultural bounty. Now it`s just a crass over-priced carnival. Gone are the horse races and shows, the 4-H competitions, home arts, the landscape and pool areas,and any home-grown charm of a County Fair. The horse stables and arena was bull-dozed for a ""farm"" area the seemingly demonstrates how easy it is to grow zucchini, LOTS of zucchini. The EXPO buildings house vendors willing to spend big bucks for a booth to sell you mops and sheets and timeshares. Booth rental rises have risen astronomically, so the vendors approach a desperation found in mall kiosks.In fact-you`ll see many of these same vendors here (the lotion lady, the hair-styling guy), that you try to dodge in the mall. I don`t do carnival rides but there are plenty for a price.The food is pricey and deep-fried. The liquor contingent guarantees no cheap drunks. The Wine Pavilion was the most empty I`ve ever seem it. In fact, the Fair was the least crowded I`ve ever seen it. Maybe the $15 parking and high cost for rides and food have finally kept people away. The million-dollar salaried LA County Fair Assoc President has stepped down after controversy and several years of running in the red. This is the last year I attend the Fair. If I want to spend a lot of money at a fake farm I`ll go to Knott`s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/70denisej
30,"Fair Day, Good Weather","Opened at noon during week. Went on Friday and it didn't start getting crowded until after 4:00. Beautiful day with easy access to most exhibits and attractions. They changed it up this year by adding more food stands (deep fried everything)and carnival attractions. Exhibit halls had light traffic as opposed to earlier years on weekdays. Added a paid attraction inside the fair this year, called Jurassic Planet for an extra $5. Food prices a little high, didn't eat there. Some of the employees were very helpful when we asked ?'s, others seemed like they were ready to go home. Parking is always a task, but at $15 they should use the Disney system. Let around 6pm and had no problem with traffic. It was open until 11pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8474WPterryb
20,Going down Hill,"2016 Fair, pretty much of the fair of the past is gone and replaced with carnival rides. If you are into carnival rides this is the place for you. The feel of a county fair is not here anymore.Paid the $30.00 for VIP parking and had to wait 22 minutes in line for tickets due to only one window open, not much VIP treatment here. The vendor buildings is basically cut in half now and lacking of new vendors. We have been coming to the fair for over 40 years and have seen a lot changes here. It would seem the board members for the fair need to visit a county fair and see what a fair looks and feels like and get back to a county fair for all to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredIBEW
40,Awesome! Would visit again!,I went to the LA County Fair for the first time since I've lived here in Los Angeles. It was definitely worth it. Could be pricey depending on what you're willing to buy. There are so many things to do. And there are SO many food options. Their fried Twinkies are by far the best. I would highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizettegarcia92
10,Terrible,For one moment I though I was in the middle of a ghetto town also everything is overpriced.I would not recommend that to my worse enemy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanazinha2017
40,LA County Fair - Fun but very crowded,"A very extensive fair with lots to see. Many carnival attractions and rides for the kids to have fun. Also, there's a lot of educational venues and an animal petting area that will stimulate a kid's adventurous mind. My kids thoroughly enjoyed petting and feeding the animals. Food, lots of food with anything that you can imagine and more. All this fun comes at a premium price so be prepared to spend some $$$. And be prepared to put up with a very crowded place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RktDogg
30,Fun but pricey!,"Went to the fair yesterday and had a lot of fun but couldn't believe how expensive everything was. Admission wasn't too bad at $12 apiece (Ralph's special tickets) but parking was $15. Food everywhere was outrageous - come on, average of $11 for a single, no cheese, no nothing hamburger? We found King Taco that had tacos for $1.99 each so that was pretty good but they were small and we really had to look to find them. Buildings were air conditioned and there were lots of vendors with interesting things to look at. We didn't buy any ride tickets because they were so expensive and each ride took multiple tickets to get on. Went to 2 of the wine tasting classes; one on affordable medal wines and one on wines of Napa valley. The presenters were awful. They were more wrapped up in themselves than in imparting knowledge and information. First class was good, second I think they messed up and poured the same wine for the last 3 tastes - they all tasted the same and I'm not the only one who thought that. My favorite is looking at all the animals, especially the babies and the Red Barn had plenty to offer there. All in all it was a fun day but be prepared to spend money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icyvelvet
40,Something for everyone!,"We visit the Fair every couple years but this is my first review. We bought a family package online at Costco.com which included 4 adult admissions, general parking and 44 ride tickets. FYI - Parking is $15.00 per car. We arrived at 4 PM on a Friday and left at 9 PM because we were tired of the crowds after dark. There is a lot to see and 5 hours is not enough time to see it all. Our favorite things to do are to visit the Model Train exhibit, the Farm and look at all the baked goods that are judged and prizes are awarded. It is easy to get caught up in the exhibit buildings where vendors are selling their goods. If you spend your time in those buildings you will not get to see the more interesting things. We are into more healthy foods than the ordinary fair offerings so we ate at Maria's Italian Kitchen which is across from the entrance to the grandstand. They have indoor and limited outdoor seating and their prices are reasonable. There is a double decker carousel among the dozens of rides which is pretty cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
40,Dare to Fair! : A View Without Kiddos,"This adventure was adults only. None of the kids came along.We got to the fairgrounds about 4:30pm and ended up parking quite a distance from the entrance. That wasn't bad, but the $15 parking fee was a surprise. You can also purchase VIP parking for $25 that will put you closer to the entrance - or take an Uber or Lyft and meet at the pick-up/drop-off station near the entrance.Buying tickets was easy; the lines were short at that time of day (you can also buy online). Please note that entrance and rides are separate tickets. We only bought entrance. Be sure to check the prices, discounts and special event days online to save a little money. There are special days to donate canned goods for a good cause as well!Once inside the park you better have your hunger on because there are so many food vendors you will want to eat everything you see. Bring your money, honey. Food is priced on the high side throughout the fair with many items in the $6 - $12 range. If you visit The Marketplace, you’ll find specials of the day at the Italian restaurant around $15. Wine tasting, olive oil tasting, beer tasting and sake tasting are also available in The Marketplace. We decided to start with icy cold beverages at The Longboard Grill and watched the 5pm parade from comfy bar stools. High school bands, classic cars, a pirate ship and more!If you love flowers, you must visit the Flower and Garden Pavilion. This year’s theme is Watercolors. The arrangements are beautiful and the fragrance in the pavilion will overwhelm you – in a very good way! This is a must see exhibit every year but the orchids this year are really amazing.We did quite a bit of walking. We visited the outdoor animal exhibit (several sleeping since it was evening), ate churros and watched people ride the mechanical bull, saw beautiful jewelry and artwork, and admired an award-winning egg cup collection. There is something for everybody at the fair.We were there about 5 hours and didn’t get to see everything. Sometimes you just have to stop and enjoy an extra-large baked potato stuffed with hot wing style chopped chicken and blue cheese. YUM!This is the 94th anniversary of the Los Angeles County Fair. You definitely must attend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pamala001
30,Rides Are Too Expensive,"Wednesdays, Senior Citizens get in free from 12 to 4. Children under five get in free any time. So with that said, grandpa, grandma and 3 year old granddaughter got in free. First thing when you go in, you are bombarded by people with cameras wanting to take your picture. (For a price of course). Next is the big booth selling beer. It seemed like there was less stuff in the exhibits this year. Maybe because space rent is so expensive. As for the rides, all the signs clearly say that a child has to be at least 34"" tall to ride two of the rides in kiddie-land, and 36"" tall on maybe ten more of the others. All the other rides require at least 42"" tall. Our granddaughter is 36 1/2"" tall. Only two rides requiring at least 36"" tall would not let her ride. The ride with the purple spider on the top had an extremely rude girl working the ride. She said our granddaughter wasn't tall enough. There was no arguing with her. She was just rude. The other ride that wouldn't allow her to ride was the small carrousel nearby. Again, there was no arguing. She was refused the ride. We had no problem with her measuring up on all of the other rides that she went on with Grandpa. We paid $50.00 for her wristband (and $50.00 for Grandpa's wristband) and she was able to ride no more than a dozen rides. I think it helps if you know the ride operator because we saw at least five children clearly under two foot tall and yet they road the rides that required at least 36"" tall. We also saw a few children who were allowed to ride without a ticket or wristband because their Dad was friends of the ride operator. How a family of four can afford to spend the day at the fair with Mom and Dad drinking beer after beer, and kids carrying several souvenir's, and eating at every stop is mind blowing. Overall, we spent about $300.00 for the day and we didn't eat or drink beer. We really enjoyed the new Jurassic Park Dinosaurs Exhibit. It was very good and well worth the $5.00 ticket to see it. Our favorite part of the whole day was sitting and watching a brief show by the Street Drummers. They are exceptional. (and we put a good tip in their tip bucket) Our granddaughter is their #1 fan. She saw them when she was one, two and three. We make sure we see them every year. Just wish they would play a bit longer than 15 minutes. Grand also liked the giraffe, the zebras, the birds, monkeys and other live animals. The LA County Fair is a must do thing to do but just like Disneyland, make sure you have a lot of money in your pocket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninee
50,Nice be a child again,I felt like in the younger years again when I visited the LA County Fair. Lots of attractions to choose from and the foods are delicious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryananthonyb2016
40,"A great experience for first-timers, but watch out for those ""tickets""!","This was my first time ever at an American fair and I must say I really loved it. I went with my wife and my cousin sister and we had a ball of a time there.Thanks to Costco, we got 4 tickets for roughly $60, which included the parking ($15 value), entrance to the fair ($20 each) and 44 tickets: a pretty good deal!We got there around 6:30 PM after spending 2 hours in traffic (we drove over from Manhattan Beach). There is a nice little tram that drives you over from the parking area to the fair entrance and that is when all the fun started.We picked up the mandatory fries (we got the fried oreos which were delicious!) and started on all the rides. And this is when we found out how exactly the fair makes money. 44 tickets is pretty much peanuts. It just about covers 1 ride (for 3 people) and then you go back and have to buy more tickets. We bought a 100 more tickets which cost a whopping $50 and 3 more rides later, that was gone as well.We didn't really mind paying the money (and I don't mean to complain), but it did take me by surprise. But I thought it was worth the first time experience for us.The rides were awesome (I don't recall the names). We also visited the farm, which I thought was really cool.Well worth the visit. And don't forget to visit the French quarter to have the beignets and bread pudding at Harold and Belle's: a must have!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psychoanalyst
20,Waste of time,Went to the fair today. There are several things that will waste your time. We got there and it took over 45 minutes to park. Leaving it took 30 minutes to get out. There is no traffic control. There is a buffet inside called Maria's Restaurant. The $18 is a waste of money. People were standing around waiting for food. There was never enough salad or pizza. The only reason they get a 2 the Pomona Police. They were checking disabled person plaques to make that person was actually in the car. Good job there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4874APcraigb
40,Love the fair,Best deal w kids who want to ride rides is wed buy unlimited ride wrist band for $29 and get in free. Refillable cups available. I love that there plenty of places to sit n rest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zozimaa
40,A great American Fair ...,"I'm in the business so I can be tough but this fair always delivers. If you love gadgets and things that slice , dice and chop with almost 5 full huge building with vendors you can literally shop till you drop. This fair has one of the best carnival providers (RCS) in the country and features many free entertainment options. The Concert series is always top notch, I attended the Ojay's and Isley Bros. and it was a great trip down memory lane. The fair is clean and safe and a must see....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marshh2016
40,Fun fair,"We frequent every year. Previously they had the $1 first day, but now they have other opportunities.Wristbands are helpful to save money.Also the kids area has a book imcentive, where kids read books for up to 6 free rides. Find info. online. There is an age limit, but good to encourage reading.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
40,A Much Larger than Average Fair,"I've been going to the LA County Fair almost annual since I was a kid. My family and I really enjoy it. They always have a ton of air conditioned buildings with all the vendors you can imagine. They have a large agricultural animal exhibit and they have a full horse track for betting if you're inclined. For the past several years they have had a very enjoyable exotic animals like monkeys, sloths and camel, towards the southern end of the park by the pond. Of course our favorite exhibit has been the wine and beer tasting in the garden area. Lastly, they have all the other standard fair items like games, rides and tons of air food. Overall we love this fair and recommend it as one of the largest fair experiences we have ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsgilber
10,The LA County fair USED to be amazing.,"The corporation who now owns the fair has made mostly disastrous changes in the last few years. Most of the long time vendors are gone, either pushed out or couldn't afford to be there anymore. The food vendors have become homogenous. All of the independent food vendors, the amazing baked potatoes, jumbo grilled hot dogs, Mexican funnel cakes, were forced out. The fair has also become VERY expensive. Parking is $15-$20 and entrance fee goes up every year.Families can't afford to come anymore. It's very sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadyfeet
30,ALWAYS THE SAME,Been coming to the fair for 50 years. It always seems the same every year. They need to change it up from time to time. In the past the little changes they did do where horiible.We all want good venders great prices but they are just not at the L A Fair any longer. The fun zone has also lost its apeal for the cost of rides etc. I want to love it but I do not any more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikerH2937ID
50,LA County Fair 2015 . . .. Best time to go . . .Opening night!,"we decided to go over opening night on Friday after work and thats the ticket . Plenty of parking. No crowds, No lines.

50,LA County Fair 2015,Best fair in nine years. without horse racing on the grounds (off track betting at The Finish-line Grill) the flow of traffic has greatly improved. Now you can visit the farms and animal exhibits then you can reach the rides by crossing what was the track. this creates a circular flow of traffic so you can see everything without backtracking.The vendor buildings are crowed as always. seek out the Chinese Sosho Needlepoint in building 9 it is fantastic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csimmamps
40,LA County Fair,"The LA County Fair is but one event that takes place at the Fairplex, usually in September. This used to be our place to hang out when it was in town ever since I was a small child. Unfortunately it has changed quite a bit over the years and is now much smaller and more expensive than it used to be. But there is still fun to be had. Shopping in the buildings includes a wide variety of items and I bought several. There are children & adult rides and games such as balloon popping, etc. Horse racing, Wally Parks Drag Racing Musuem, and lots of food (mostly fried or BBQ) and drinks. Various animals, petting zoo, concerts, other exhibits. Enjoyed the day despite the cost. You gotta go--just bring lots of $$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daytrippergal
40,file gumbo,"At the LA County Fair yesterday, I saw that Harold and Bell's now operate a booth there. I tried the file gumbo and it was chunky with sausage, chicken drumstick, and shrimp and perfectly seasoned. If I am ever near the vicinity of the restaurant, I would love to try other entrees. Otherwise, I just have to hope that it will return to LA County Fair again next year so I can try other entrees on the menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewJ566
