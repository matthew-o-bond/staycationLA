40,Interesting little park with a lot of history tucked away in a quiet neighborhood,We stopped by here while out and about in Glendale recently. This is a neat little historical park - the location of the adobe where Mexico and the US hammered out the details for the peace treaty that ceded the southwest the to the US (the treaty was signed elsewhere). The original adobe is here and used to the main ranch house before Glendale was ever developed. The site has simple but beautiful gardens and is tucked away in a lovely neighborhood. It is worth a quick stop. The adobe is often not open but it is still worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeofJx
40,Pleasant quiet cool garden,This was a quick stop in a pleasnt cool garden with seating. We were sorry the House was not opne but peaked in all the windows. We were surpised to see that you need a permit to picnic in the seating area- not something we Brits are used to!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethh5
40,Hidden little gem of a park,"This great little punlic park in the middle of a residential neighborhood is lovely and quiet, with big old trees and picmic tables. The historic old adobe house is a gem. My wife and I were married at this park thirty years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RH631
40,Quaint taste of life in the ranchero,Quaint taste of life on the ranchero. Rather a hidden gem as it is located in the Glendale neighborhoods. I grew up nearby and perhaps do not appreciate it as much as others. Still it is definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Picinic Anyone,This is 1 of the 1st houses of Glendale. There is seldom a day when you can have peace and quiet. Its a place for parties and lots of activities include the usual June wedding photo spots and it was where my 1st wedding took place. It is always clean and has tables with shade. They also have a BBQ facility with sink unless they took it out. It closes at dusk and not sure if dogs are welcome. The best time to go is at Christmas when you can tour the house and its lit up really nice. Its some thing to see if your in to the history of Glendale.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevenss
40,Classic Spanish Adobe,"You can visit this historic landmark, which is part of the heritage of Glendale. Nice grounds and the city built up around it. North of Glenoaks Blvd., just off the 134 Frwy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
30,Interesting bit of local and national history.,"This tiny park consists of some very uneven walkways and an old adobe house that you can't enter. But, here two generals met to plan a peace treaty in 1847. It's a nice shady spot and worth stopping by. Parking is on the street in the middle of a neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grip652
50,Small park,"Great small park, it can be rented out for parties. Not over crowded like most parks, good parking,quite area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1536WFpatriciaa
30,"Unexpected oasis of serenity in the middle of Glendale, CA","In addition to its historic merit, Glendale's Casa Adobe de San Rafael (and park) is an amazing, serene getaway right in the middle of Glendale, CA. Even if the adobe house is not open for viewing, the park grounds include beautiful, restful gardens and an expansive picnic area. Parking is more than adequate for a fairly large group and, from appearances, chances are good that you will have the place to yourself.While we visited out of genuine interest in adobe dwellings and the history of Rancho San Rafael, it was immediately clear that the Casa Adobe de San Rafael is a hidden treasure. For a wedding, other event, or casual family picnic, the grounds of Casa Adobe de San Rafael are the next best thing to owning an estate yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrademarkTraveler
