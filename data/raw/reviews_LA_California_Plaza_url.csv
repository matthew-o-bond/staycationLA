It features music, dance, film, spoken word artists and speakers from around the world.The California Plaza features Amphitheatre styled seating with a fountain and it is an outdoor venue. There are a few eateries on the ground floor. It is a great place to meet friends to enjoy music from around the world.

40,Lovely Little Area In Downtown LA,Peaceful little area in the middle of all the skyscrapers with a few cafes. a water feature and plenty of seating.

50,Restful oasis in middle of town,"This lovely spot is in the middle of town, overlooked by the Omni Hotel amongst other tall buildings. There is a walkway, a lake, and plenty of tables and chairs where one can rest and enjoy the spot. It's a sunken area (on the side of a hill, really), and there's a walkway around the top of it as well. On one side is the old cable car building, nicely restored, though the cable car running down the hillside is no longer in operation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspire591606
