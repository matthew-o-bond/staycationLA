40,Great Vantage point for wathing plane take-off at LAX,I walked the 10 minutes from the Embassy Suites at El Segundo to watch the planes at LAX. Clutter’s Park is on a small hill and provides a good scenic view of LAX and the runways. The park was not so crowded and there were fewer then 10 plane spotters hanging around. It was a relaxing way to spend the early evening after an 11 hour flight from Paris and before getting something to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/st25w
50,"the adress for the listing is incorrect : check: 425 E Imperial Ave, El Segundo, CA 90245",Suggested to adjust the listing with the correct address.Srill the best spot in Los Angeles.check before taking photos where all electrical lines are in the different angles before taking photos. Parking can be a challenge and make sure to do a bathroom stop before getting there....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
40,Plane Watching,"Calling it a Park is a bit misleading. It's basically just a wide spot in the sidewalk with a couple benches and a trash can. No services, i.e. bathrooms, and limited street parking.However, IT IS just about the best spot to watch airplanes taking off/landing at LAX. This place is considered a must see location by aerophiles. It's 200ft elevation above LAX is beautiful.On a clear day/night it's a great location to photo aircraft taking off with the Santa Monica Mountains in the background.If you're into planes it's a very peaceful spot in a quiet neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedDevil1504
40,LAX Viewpoint w Jets ...,"Visiting Clutter's Park / Imperial Park is a great way to get a front row seat on the air traffic in and out of LAX. Discovered it years ago and take friends and visitors there to see all of the amazing activity. A few tables / chairs & no bathroom or food - it's a small viewing spot only, but fun for doing that! Enjoy the silver birds. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,One of the best plane spotting place in the world,"Addicted to aviation photography, you will find there among the best spot on earth for aviation photography. The range of foreign airlines ( both for passengers, cargo and also VIP) is rarely matched anywhere else.The park is located on an elevated part of the land near the airport with a direct view to the international terminal. Parking can be tricky especially during weekends.Food can be purchased a block away towards the west.Bathroom facilities are found at the Embassy Suites hotel 4 blocks away.Make sure to study all arrival and departure movements for your favorite airline / aircraft and also check with the locals for any special movements of special livery aircraft and or VIP flights.Scope the flight line before taking pictures, there are some trees in the way of the best angle for arriving aircrafts and far too many phone/ electrical lines as well that will sneak in your perfect shot and only to be revealed once you are back home working on the photos.Keep also in mind that that area gets often affected by the marine layer as for the light and also need for warmer clothing in some instances.Rainy/ stormy days also bring a reverse pattern for all takeoff and landings with the flights coming from the ocean..Make sure to bring a camera with a good long lenses ( at least a 200 MM), a spare battery and a fast memory card.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
50,Unique and super special.,"If you like plane watching, this small area is super special. Even if you don’t, it’s still surprisingly good and, if you are near this area, it would be a real shame not to sample it.Barely an “Attraction” in the normal sense and not exactly a Park either! “Clutters Park” is a widened side walk with a few benches and small tables, situated on East Imperial Avenue at Sheldon St. Street. Parking is free and usually not a problem.It is commonly known to the old-timers as Imperial Hill, though it’s unlikely you’ll find that name on a map. It’s USP (Unique Selling Point) is that it’s the highest viewing area close to LAX Airport. If you want to watch non-stop planes in and out of Los Angeles, this is absolutely THE place to do it. Even non-plane lovers seem to enjoy a relaxing 20 minutes panoramic view of non-stop air-traffic at one of the world’s busiest airports. Bring a picnic!If you want to stay a little longer but your companions don't, send them 250 yards east, along E Imperial to El Segundo Doggy Park, another little niche “attraction” in this area! This too can be fun. After that, you can all go visit the Flight Path Learning Center & Museum, just another quarter mile East, then left down the little hill of California St, then left (West) on Imperial Highway and then next right into the airport area, again on California St.If any of this, including the doggies, is of the slightest interest, you can easily spend a half, or even a full day in this area, for absolutely free. On that basis, it’s hard to fault and it gets 5 stars from me though it’s obviously not everyone’s cup of tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John-Tropi
