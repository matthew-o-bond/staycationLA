50,The Last Song,"Sting. What more is there to say. Sting tells wonderful stories through his songs in concerts and recordings. This time Sting tells the very personal story of people in a town whose economy and life’s blood is building ships. The musical “The Last Ship” resonates as a story of working class Union shipbuilders as they face the end of their work and community with strength and dignity. Growing up in a city that relied on making steel, the story hit home in its authenticity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAbywayofPgh
50,Beautiful February evening at the theatre,"Before seeing ""The Last Ship"" starring Sting at the Ahmanson, we got a glass of wine at the music center's wine bar and sat outside to watch the Pavilion fountain light show. The theater itself was large and comfortable. It was a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leklekblue
40,Stop and smell the roses,"Everyone is busy nowadays so taking a break to enjoy a live show and experience the theater is such a treat. We saw Sting’s The Last Ship. It was a Friday evening and the Ahmanson was packed. Before you get to the theater, the vibes kinda sets you up for a wonderful evening. The ushers were nicely dressed, helpful and friendly. The theater’s feel staged a relaxing evening. Seats were comfy and the stage props and lighting complemented each other. As the musical went on, you focused on several parts of the stage where the actors were not like a typical movie where you just looked straight ahead at all times. It was a favorable experience and worth the drive. You have to stop and smell the roses sometimes to enjoy the little treats in life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5323DQjennifers
50,Great view from the most distant seats,"We recently saw a show at the Ahmanson Theater and didn't by any means have the best seats. That said, we have a great view and the acoustics were fine. The lobby areas may be a bit small, but the outdoor patio offers an overflow area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/too_few_trips_1
50,Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake,"Our Family visited the Music Center in L.A. and saw a show at the Ahmanson Theater on New Year's Eve. It is very centrally located! We took an Uber there and once arriving, everything was well situated and very easy to find. There was an outdoor bar and concession, as well as indoor bar and concession. The nice thing about the outdoor bar was having a drink in the open air prior to the show on a lovely California evening (65ish). Once we entered the theatre, there were a sufficient amount of ushers to assist us with locating our seats, however it is an easy theatre to maneuver. We sat in the mezzanine and the seats were perfect and so reasonably priced. The bathrooms and entire theatre were well maintained and very clean. We had a fabulous evening and highly recommend any of the shows at this wonderful Music Center. Very top notch performance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelinghappygirl
40,The theater is showing its age a bit...,"Tonight we attended a performance of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake, not the corps de ballet variety we are accustomed to. This was 9 women and 16 men, in a Palace Bedroom and a Seedy Bar Club staging and sets among others. The swans were a brutal group of bare back men, and if you were sitting in the front row, their sweat hit you numerous times. The movements were fast, sharp, and ominous. At times violent. The theater is old, the carpet and seats in need of replacement. Our entry theater was down a flight of stairs, into a small bar and restroom area. But from row C a great view of the performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz
50,Swooned by Swan Lake,Run don't walk to see this performance. It was better than I could have imagined. We had excellent seats and I highly recommend this one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylK358
50,Swan lake,Truly the most incredible performance of the most talented choreographer with such amazing brilliance and talent and skill of all the performers. The costumes were awesome and the new choreography update was breathtaking.Sometimes the lack of an orchestra could be noted as the richness of the music and the notes were lost to the audio.Some of the far left and right seatsEven in the 1st 8 or 10 rows of the orchestra section have portions that get blocked.The theater does need an update and the lighting is very dismal.But the performance of Swan Lake should not be missed it is a once in a lifetime are hopefully a multiple in a lifetime experience to witness this true masterpiece,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irvinggetthecar
20,New Center Patio area,"We attended a production at the Music Center this past Saturday. It was hot and there is no shade to speak of. The new center patio restaurant has very little roof for shade (and rain). The small bar on the other side has a few seats and the bar and, again, very little shade in which to relax and enjoy a drink. The center section is open, without shade and unusable. Bad design and not user friendly. Karen",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5759XEkarens
50,Lovely performance space,"One of the performance venues in the splendid Music Center, it is highly decorative with fine crafted artistic flourishes on the circular façade.Set in a grand plaza with sparkling water features and outdoor eateries it was great to stroll around and admire it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,Plays plays plays,Been attending the Ahmanson with my mom since I was a kid. Always easy to get in and out and parking easy too.Saw many plays there-sound and music good. Would recommend for a night out in downtown LA. You can walk to a few restaurants before the venue starts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ticket2Venture
50,Hysterically funny!,We saw The Play That Goes Wrong at the Ahmanson. Hands down the funniest play ever! Starts before you even know it with the Stage Manager asking if we have seen the dog. Goes to absurdity and merriment from there. So fun With lightning fast slapstick and scenery stunts. Just breathtakingly smart.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/459patriciah
50,"""The Play That Goes Wrong"" What a Great Time",I came with my wife who suggested it for just the two of us. Thinking it not for the kid's. We had such a wonderful time laughing all most the entire time. So as soon as we got out of the play we booked it again and this time were bring the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996kirk
50,High Quality Production,"We had seen Come From Away on Broadway and found this production equally as good. Entry, Exit and parking was reasonable and easy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/New-Newman
50,Excellent Theater to see Ballet or Musical Comedy,"This is a great theater made even better by wide aisles and comfortable seats. We have eaten just outside the theater in the outdoor cafe and it is very good. The restaurants in the Music Center are also very good but require a reservation well in advance. There are also many great restaurants a 5 minute Uber Ride away from the theater, including the always fun Grand Central Market which has many stalls to suit any taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/359jordank
50,A first-class venue,"Located on Grand Avenue near the I-110 and US 101 freeways in downtown Los Angeles, the Ahmanson Theatre is one of the four main venues (along with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Mark Taper Forum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall) that comprise the Los Angeles Music Center.Parking is available in an adjacent underground structure (NOTE: Bring cash for parking; at the time of this writing the parking fee was less than $10 US). The structure has dedicated escalators leading up to the entrance plaza; after the show ends, the escalators reverse downward.The lobby of the theatre is rather narrow, but if you’re seeking refreshments you can find additional bars and snack stands in the wings. The seats are comfortable and there is more-than-adequate legroom. The acoustics are outstanding and the sightlines are excellent. NOTE that the Ahmanson is quite large (capacity of 2,084) so if your seats are in the upper balcony you may want to bring opera glasses or a small set of binoculars.The theatre employees were almost uniformly professional, pleasant and helpful. The temperature in the theatre was comfortable. We’ve enjoyed many performances at the Ahmanson, and this one (“Come From Away”) was no exception. The combination of a great show at a well-run and well-maintained venue pretty much ensures a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinDan
50,The Ahmanson is Always a Great Venue,"The Ahmanson Theatre features big ""Broadway"" type shows. Parking is underground from the venue, not costly and super convenient. Restaurants are nearby and a couple on the Music Center campus.One time we ended up with seats in a box closest to the stage and it was not good. If it had been another show that is more static we would have missed a lot from audience stage right. Fortunately the ""Come From Away"" cast was always moving and so we did not miss much. Other than that all the seats are good. I do recommend the front of the mezzanine or front half of orchestra seating. Sound is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickA356
50,Great place to taken a show! and plenty of great shows to take in!,"Easy parking (that isn't insane expensive), great sound, even the 'nose bleed' seats are good. Plenty of places to grab a drink pre-show!Most recently- we saw 'Come from Away' which was amazing! Tight cast and staging made the experience very intimate.Looking forward to going back to see more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkynSea4me
40,Former season pass holder and frequent visitor for live theater...,"I've seen so many plays and musicals here that I've honestly lost count. I'll break down as the goods and not so goods for easier reading:GOODS:*usually a good selection of titles come through as part of the US touring circuit.*good usher presence in the event you need assistance.*easy access from parking lot below if you drive, otherwise there is a large (mostly uncovered) section off Grand to await your ride share.*nice outdoor area to wait outside in good weather between the Dorothy Chandler and Ahmanson theaters.NOT SO GOODS:*not the most comfortable seating where the sections can get super tight - not quite sure why they built it with no center aisle - very uncomfortable and bizarre. As a result, its better to sit in the individual box seats tbh.*the lobby concessions always have long lines and the options are somewhat limited as they work off of bar carts. The drinks come in small plastic cups and are not the most ideal to bring inside the theater. Not sure why they haven't adopted the thicker plastic cup method like theaters on Broadway or West End.*audio system is good for orchestra level and needs some better speaker placement or boosting for mezz level.*stagebills are larger than normal and not sure why - prefer the more traditional Playbill size as a keepsake - theirs is magazine size so its annoying to carry for remainder of the night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooshLA
50,"A beautiful, efficient and easy venue to see all the best shows.","The key to making your tickets for the Ahmanson a perfect evening is to allow plenty of time! Paid parking is not crazy expensive and very nearby, however you may find yourself several stories underground and the going in, and out can be slow. Parking under Grand Park, across the street, can be a best bet, if you arrive early enough. The theatre itself is well maintained and clean. Finding your seat is easy and I haven't found a bad seat in the house, even my last minute Come From Away ticket in the 5th to last row on the left aisle was just fine. There are some cafe type and cart vendors in the plaza for a quick bite to eat or if time permits try Grand Central Market, loads of choices and if your'e not opposed to walking a couple of blocks you can park once, nearer the theatre, and walk to Grand Central then head back to the show. Check out any events at Grand Park that might coincide with your tickets, there is often some kind of party going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisaj_12
40,A Wonderful Play in a Good Theater,"It was our first time seeing a play in downtown Los Angeles, and we found this theater to be fairly large with plenty of parking underground at a reasonable price of $9 per vehicle. The seats were OK. We had aisle seats so it was not too much of a problem other than constantly getting up to let the late arrivals go to their seats in the middle. The sound system was good, but does not come even remotely close to the ones in NYC to represent musical presentations.We had come to see the play “Come from Away” – the true story of humanity in the tiny town of Gander in Newfoundland, Canada. The population of 6000 instantly doubles when a bunch of planes are diverted here after the 9-11 tragedy. How the people cope with their emotions, prejudices and pre-conceived notions and develop lasting friendships was extremely touching to experience. The play is very well written, sung beautifully and executed perfectly.We were a little worried about the crazy traffic in downtown, so we arrived at 6 PM, had a quick dinner nearby, and arrived right on time for the 8 PM play. So glad we were able to see this with a bunch of family members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheExplorerFamily

30,"went to ""Come from Away""","The play was excellent - 5 stars .The theatre while being extemely nice had one major flaw.There is absolutely no leg room at all. Luckily for me,I was in the last row, so i was able to stand for most of the play.the legroom is less then you would get on the worse airline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcohn2018
40,Theater in LA,"Got to see Broadway in LA with Dear Evan Hansen...theater is a bit dated and worn, but good acoustics and reasonably good tiered seating, not too big, so more intimate than cavernous. A good spot for a good show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
40,Surprisingly intimate theater,"A home for original productions and Broadway touring companies, the design of this theater makes even the back rows feel surprisingly close to the stage. The technical staff know how to work with the visiting productions and shows here are consistently high quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq

40,""" Ain't Too Proud Was Good ""","My wife and I went to Los Angeles to see the theater production of "" Ain't To Proud "" at the Ahmanson theater. This was the story of the life and times of the Temptations. The Temptations were a historical American vocal group who released a series of successful singles and albums with Motown Records during the 1960's and 1970's style. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are among the most successful groups in popular music. The Ahmanson Theatre is a nice venue with balconies and 3 levels of seating. I just wish there were a little more leg room between rows. Also there are a lot of stairs to climb up and down. All & All The Ahmanson Theatre was nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandslamhomer

50,A Music Center Theatre,Went in June to see Humans . The play was very disappointing but the theatre is great. They are undergoing major construction right now but you can still valet or self park on the premises. The sound system in the theatre is fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol

40,GREAT AREA,"The Ahmanson is part of the Music Center, in one of my favorite areas of Downtown LA. Wander around, be sure and see the Walt Disney across 1st and Grand Park across Grand. Best place to take photos of LA skyline is the Water and Power building across Hope. Lots of still (mostly) water for reflections of Downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drdroad
50,"5 star theater. ""Soft Power"" is weak","The Play-Musical ""Soft Power"" opened at the Ahmanson in May 2018. Created by two Tony Award winners, David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori, much was expected. To quote a line from the script, ""two halves don't add up to one"" for this show. Hwang delivers on the story from the beginning, but Tesori plays catch-up with the music well past the intermission. I had to convince myself not to depart at the intermission. The satirical story of American culture that brought us the surprise election result in 2016, along with the comedy, and take-away messages of hope are strong throughout. The score before the intermission should be burned and completely rewritten before the show goes to San Francisco. In the last few scenes, beginning with ""Good Guy with a Gun,"" the toes and fingers begin to come alive with tapping, and you can feel the audience energy begin to enjoy the music and singing. But the exhilarating finish isn't enough to fill the seats. Prior to the lively ending, the music is dull and difficult for both the audience and the performers. Even the great choreography doesn't help. Opening notes and transitions were often off-key because the musical composition is overly complex (and just not enjoyable). Without a significant rework, I don't see how this show will make it to Broadway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,Good place to see a show,"The theater seats about 2000 people. It is not very wide but it is deep so sit close to the front if you can. The best thing is the 9 dollar parking. Great price for downtown. When heading back to your car, skip the long line on the escalator and use the stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zeusallover
40,Grand Theatre but beware top level,We hadn’t been here for close to 20 years. It’s still a great theatre with comfortable seats and good sightlines. But looking up to the top level it looks awfully high and I would avoid. Good parking very cheap ($9) underneath. Recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
50,Bright Starを観ました,"大きさは、渋谷のシアターオーブと同じか、若干小さいくらいかと思います。Carmen Cusackさんは、トニー賞にノミネートされただけあって、素晴らしいパフォーマンスでした。また、Ticket Counterの方がGood Guyで、彼が""Best Deal I can offer""といった席を買ったのですが、it truly was the best dealでした。たった３５ドルで、素晴らしい席で楽しめました。I sincerely appreciate the guy in ticket counter who orgnized me that great seat. 英語がわからなくても、なんとなくストーリーはわかりましたし、十分楽しめました。土日でしたら、昼間の時間帯の公演もあるようです。夜の時間帯の公演の場合は、ＪＴＢさんをはじめとする、ハイヤーサービスにご相談されると良いのではないかと思います。",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5441
50,Great place to see the arts...,"If you are a buff for the arts, the Ahmanson Theatre is your place. The theatre is large with a rustic feel.

50,Excellent large theatre,"It is hard to review a theater since the building and the performances are intertwined. The Center Theatre Group almost always offers excellent plays and the one we attended, ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time"" was no exception. We had mezzanine tickets on the aisle for a matinee and paid just $23 for them. As expected, the very right side of the stage was not visible. The seats are comfortable, access to all areas is easy, and people are enjoying themselves. What else can you ask for?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
50,All around fun experience,"The Ahmanson Theater, located in downtown LA, is an ideal spot for theater-goers. Beautiful place, food on site, and it was generally not overly crowded and nice.

The difference in price being so little, we always valet now.There are 3 theaters in the same space, the locals are super friendly so if you need to be pointed to the right one, just ask.The Ahmanson itself has great sound and comfortable seating. Most seats are great, avoid the back of the balcony if you can. Always buy your tickets in advance. You can get them on line.

Welcome to our theater and a friendly guide, if needed?Where are the handicapped entrances, since it's 2 stair flights up to the entrance?The intermission was short for such a large group for snacks, bathroom breaks, drinks. The snack bar, wine bar was manned by 2 people! Yes, you have to gooutside to eat, drink and then miss out on the first few minutes of the second act. No evident warning (that we heard) that the second act was starting.The fire alarm went off 1/2 way through the first act---evidently had happened a few times before according to my neighboring patron.The sound, actors, and lighting were top notch.

20,Fun Home - not so much,"Not much fun.Shoulda stayed home.I know this show has won all sorts of awards, and is critically and publicly acclaimed. However I was not a fan. Perhaps I was expecting a little nostalgia, a little hope, but that's not what I got. The show itself was dark and heavy, and I don't like leaving the theater with an additional burden. The main character transferred her burden to the audience. I was on board with the themes -- middle-aged lesbian cartoonist looks back on her life with parents had to earlier life stages. But it was just heavy and unfinished, too messy. My favorite segment was her College self coming out and having her first relationship. Other than that, the story felt half-finished and very heavy.

40,DTLA Theater With Award-Winning Shows and Plays,"One of the venues in the Music Center complex in downtown LA on Bunker Hill. Dine and meander al fresco among the various theaters. The Ahmanson usually has plays and musicals. Some are national touring shows, others might be of a new production or something quasi-experimental. They sell season subscriptions but you can usually find something at the box office a few days before; especially for mid-week showings. Possibly even a lower price for a day of performance purchase. I just saw the musical Amelie which was in prep for a Broadway opening. It's only been staged for about a year and still has some rough spots. The music is upbeat and involving but the story is muddled. (I saw the film and know the original story). Post show I heard many comments from attendees about not understanding the basic premise. But you take your chance on any performance like this. Still, if you budget the time, seeing something here is a nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti

In fact it was at quite a height from the stage. It was almost as if we were in the Austrian Alps and looking down at the convent in Salzburg. However we still had a good view of the stage and the acoustics were satisfactory. I would not say that the Ahmanson Theatre has as much character as the Pantages. However, we were there to enjoy the revival of a great musical and not to dwell on the architecture.

Hardly wait time at the box office. Many staffs are on duty. Lobby is not too big but there is still place to sell merchandise and drinks/snacks.The theater is clean & well maintained. The stage is not too big. The sound system is great.If I am craving for NY Broadway moment, I will definitely come here for a show.The Parking: Parking Structure. $9 cash only",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,"Great, almost intimate, for a large theatre.","The Ahmanson is a nice spot to catch a show. Seats are comfortable. View from almost anywhere is good. We most recently sat in the mezzanine and everything on stage was clear. Easy to get to, easy parking, close restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danap675
50,Always enjoy my time here!,"I've seen several great shows here, the latest one being ""Matilda."" Theater is a good size and seating is comfortable. Good acoustics and plenty of parking. I feel so lucky to have such a nice venue nearby in my hometown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathysO2496LP
40,Great Productions,"I love that this theatre so often has top name actors in its productions rather than the usual touring companies. We try to see every show at the Ahmanson and usually get inexpensive seats which have never disappointed.There's no need to go to an expensive pre-theatre dinner, there are plenty of tables to sit at and enjoy an evening picnic on the Music Center's patio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BThomas2218
40,Nice theater but bad if you have cheap seats,"I have enjoyed productions at this theater in the past. They are efficient, parking is easy, there is a good restaurant super close (Kendall's), they have go sessions inside but lines get super long. However, If you have bad seats it is unpleasant because it feels really high. I have had bad seats I at other theaters and still enjoyed myself but we went to see Matilda with our Girl Scout troop and had cheap seats and it really ruined the experience. We were so high one mom got really anxious and wanted to leave. I would recommend skipping if you have to get cheap seats. Cheep seats at Pantages are much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
40,ahhh to the Ahmanson. Friendly staff and great location,I've been to the Ahmanson Theatre for a few productions. I like the set up of the theatre and the seats in the mezzanine level are ALL great. The seats are worn on the wood edges and in the second row B you were able to see spaces between a few of them where it seems they have replaced a few of the seats but in a not so neat way. Some seats have 2 armrests because of it. But the seats are still comfortable especially for the 2 hours plus of sitting.There's a nice courtyard with fountains and street performers singing songs. As you get closer towards the doors to the Ahmanson there are more orchestrated and professional bands outside singing. There is a place that is set up to have dinner as well. Not sure how kid friendly the menu is. There are plenty of places in the area to eat since the theatre is so centralized.The Ahmanson is easy to access from the freeway as well as streets. Parking is easy and moderate cost.For the production of Matilda it was difficult to understand the cast during the singing. I think a lot had to do with the over annunciation that the kids were doing. You didn't get lost with the story line but certainly you missed some words to the songs. Otherwise the sound here is GREAT!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowbuxlux
30,Great Hall Lousy Sound,"We Went to see Matilda The musical last night. The talent and energy of the cast was superb the problem was it was impossible to understand much of the words the speakers weren't properly delayed, that and the combing made intelligibility impossible. What a shame the show was fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csimmamps
50,Took Mom to see Cinderella,"My mother hadn't attended much theater in her time, so we opted to see a story that she would have no issue with, and where we could also take in granddaughter memories for her. Cinderella at the Ahmanson seemed perfect. Parking is easy at their underground lot, and there are options for lunch with the Patio Grill, a small snack shop, and a sort of upscale taco stand on the grounds. The Ahmanson always features excellent performances - usually touring versions of shows just from Broadway. I recall seeing ""Carnage"" and ""War Horse"" there recently and both were wonderfully done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,An all time favorite and worth the drive even from the O.C.!,"Whenever I am considering a special evening out, I'm always seeing what's playing at the Ahmanson. We have seen several big broadway plays here and never been disappointed. The seating is good but try to sit in the first row of the mezzanine if available. You need to plan for LA traffic if driving from south orange county. I always allow about double the miles for time from where I live (I.e. 45 miles, allow 90 minutes). Haven't missed a play yet using this method!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGP_Esq
50,Downtown Magic,"Attended Blythe Spirit & enjoyed every minute. The day before the performance, I received a courtesy voicemail that a race nearby may impact traffic. Being unfamiliar with the area, took the metro to Grand Park then walked through the park - highly recommended for a daytime performance. The theater seats were comfortable and the theater was well-ventilated without being cold. Seeing Angela Lansbury in person was a dream come true. Thank you to all the kind and helpful staff members. Looking forward to returning to this downtown gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4872QNjennyc
50,"Excellent Theatre, Easy Parking, & Cinderella was Amazing!!","This theatre has it all: easy parking, great acoustics, comfortable seating, friendly staff, good snacks and great shows! Cinderella was one of the best musicals we've seen- what a production! So memorable and simply gorgeous to watch. Try and get there at least 30 minutes before showtime as the courtyard is just lovely. Even better, go several hours in advance and take a walk around downtown and go for Sunday brunch! Make a day out of it and enjoy LA for all it's glory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariK888
40,Comfortable theater with lots of parking,"The Ahmanson Theatre is part of the Los Angeles Music Center. There are several choices for parking - there are public lots within a few block but we opt for the parking under the theaters or the valet parking. The valet on the N Hope street side is the most convenient but only open about two hours before the performance. Water, snacks and drinks are sold from the top concession stands - but they are usually crowded...walk down the stairs the lower level and there is usually no wait but the bars right next to the restrooms. The seats are comfortable and have a bit more room than its counterparts in NY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_a_lot4fun
40,Thoroughly enjoyable with very good acoustics.,We saw Dame Edna's....Glorious Goodbye. We booked from overseas but still obtained good seats--not far away but not that close that there would be a risk of Dame Edna sending us up. Enjoyed the whole complex theatre is housed in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamhart
40,Dame Edna Concert Was Fabulous,"We went to the Ahmanson Theater to see Dame Edna's ""Goodbye"" concert. We had tickets in the upper balcony but was able to see the whole performance and hear quite well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerrywHamilton
50,One of My Favorite Places in Los Angeles,"This review is for my most recent visit to the Ahmanson ( Dame Edna's Glorious Goodbye The Farewell Tour), but I've been to this theatre easily a hundred times over the last thirty years. This theatre is where I fell in love with Theatre and saw my first big Broadway musical. I think of the Ahmanson as nothing short of magical.On my recent visit, we sat in the orchestra, to the right of the stage. The seats were fantastic, so close that I thought Dame Edna might pick on us! I've sat in every section and admittedly, the balcony is too far back for me. I will usually splurge for orchestra. The boxes seem fun, but they are a little off to the side and not the best view.Tip- if the restrooms are too crowded ( which isn't usually an issue), there are extra restrooms just outside of the theatre, on the left if you are exiting the building. This is a huge save when it's busy. Also, make sure to arrive early. Parking gets crazy when all three music center theatre have productions at the same time! Plus, the Music Center is a lovely spot for pre-theatre drinks or a meal. If you've never been, make sure to come early and enjoy the full experience.Like my review? Check out my blog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
40,Our First Time...,"... to the theater to see Dame Edna's Glorious Goodbye -- the Farewell Tour.I was worried that we had seats too far back to see the stage -- but I wasn't disappointed. This theater had wonderful seating for this kind of event.The only downside I could see was that the mezzanine level seating rows only had access at the end of the aisle, there's no center aisle access. Might be something to think about if you've got some mobility/handicapped issues. It didn't bother me one bit -- but check with the box office before ordering your tickets.I loved the plaza out front and the spillover of the other venues makes it a fun time with tables, chairs and benches. Bring a picnic/wine to share before the event and you're set. Parking was pretty easy for this event even though it was Opening Night.Run -- don't walk to see Dame Edna!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DivaLVegas
50,Seating Better than Advertised,"It's nice when something is even BETTER than advertised. The seating at the Ahmanson is amazing. (The little camera icons on the seating chart on the website didn't do the seats justice.) We were in the back, way back, of the orchestra (""W"" I think) But...The sound was perfect. The view of the stage was superb. We could see the wrinkles on Angela Lansbury's face (sorry Angela). In fact you might not really want to have front row seats; it looks like you're pretty low and would get a crick in your neck from looking up at the stage. Happy, happy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabD4353HQ
50,Always A Great Experience,We've been to the Ahmanson several times to see musicals and plays [the latest being Blithe Spirit with Angela Lansbury] and we've always come away thoroughly entertained. The visual design of the Ahmanson and the plaza out front is spectacular [the lighted water fountain alone is a treat].You have several dining options on site and several others nearby that offer free shuttle service. so make a night of it.It's big city culture without the stuffiness.Go. Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282daved
50,Cozy and Relaxing,"Went to see Angela Lansbury in, ""Blithe Spirit"" and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. From the beautiful fountains with Christmas colors and decorations, outdoor restaurant and drinks in the plaza (pricey), Christmas caroling outside the theatre, and great acoustics/acting in the theatre. Love the Music Center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexander5431
40,Terrific,"This is a terrific place to see a show. It's big enough to attract quality talent, yet small enough to have an intimate feel. Particularly good for dance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Excellent venue!,"I got to see the play ""The Trip To Bountiful"", starring the venerable Miss Cicely Tyson, Blair Underwood, Vanessa Williams and Jurnee Smollett. The acoustics are perfect. One can easily hear every line of dialog. I've always enjoyed every performance that I have seen here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lannyc2018
50,An Evening At the Theater,"My friends and I visited the Ahmanson in May 2014 to see ""Porgy and Bess"". Picking up the tickets at ""Will Call"" was quick and efficient. Sitting in the courtyard while waiting for the doors to open, we observed some people enjoying what might be called a light ""picnic"". Once inside the theater, we enjoyed amazing songs and performances with quite comfortable seating and air conditioning. We were later provided a brief intermission in pleasant and elegant surroundings. The Ahmanson is a premier venue for friends and family to gather for an evening at the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13
50,Wonderful!,"Great Venue and quality show,"" We will Rock You"" comfortable seats , all good! I bought the season pass for 6 shows at a great value! It is so worth the money because I will be in the 8th row, same seats all season and when next year rolls around I can have the same seats or opt to find better ones if someone doesn't renew, great deal and greatly discounted plus it gets me out of thee house and is enriching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92657
50,great place to see a play,"I saw ""We Will Rock You"" here. It's a great theater, great acoustics, very nice place to see a play. Parking was surprisingly easy. Great venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blacey1
50,We will rock you Musical,"What a great time we had at the Ahmanson. We saw the musical We Will Rock You. It was such fun, so many great songs and the performers were phenomenal! Before the show a free Samba lesson took place in the courtyard and that put us in the ""party"" mood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCamper856
50,"We became bohemians, in rhapsody!","Although I have been to the Los Angeles Music Center before, I have never been in the Ahmanson. My daughter and I experienced ""We Will Rock You"", the British musical set to Queen music. We had purchased through a portal where we did not pick our seats, but even on the side, it was a wonderful experience!This theater is a small venue than the Dorothy Chandler, but the experience is the same....acoustics very good and seating comfortable. We will be adding this to our 'go to's' for LA entertainment!The show, itself, was amazing!!! As what happens often (even in concerts), the first act showcases some of the lesser-known music of Queen. In my opinion, it set the storyline for the second act...where all of the favorites were performed with great enthusiasm. Sadly, some people left after the first act, in disappointment. They should have stayed. It was AMAZING at the end, when Bohemian Rhapsody was performed, and we all were on our feet!!!Just a few tips:My NAV decided to take me on a 'tour' of downtown L.A.....told me that the theater was on the right at one point, since I had put in the Temple street address. The underground parking, safe and handy, has its entrance on Grand. There is a flat rate parking after 4:30pm of $9 (as of last night, anyway), as long as you pay cash on the way in.There are plenty of munchies being sold in and around the theater, but be prepared to pay, well, theater prices. There is also an open-air restaurant right on the complex grounds, as well as a kiosk for drinks, etc.The musical, itself, is amazing, but a bit graphic, in my opinion, for young kids. But that was Queen...always on the edge! Don't leave at intermission because, as the couple behind us said ""This is not enough Queen for us!"". The second act is packed with it!! And the singing is fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmarq55
40,Theatre in the Heart of Los Angeles,"I've made two visit to the Ahmanson this year, and was pleased both times by not only the facility itself, but the accessibility to the theatre.Outside of the building, you can enjoy a wonderful view of Los Angeles, complimented by a well-maintained water fountain exhibit and some dining options. Once inside, you'll find yourself treated to a modern building, which while a little sterile, serves its purpose well. The parking is conveniently located directly beside/underneath the building, and is amazingly easy to get to from the freeway.To say more about that last point, being a Los Angeles native, I'm use to fighting out of parking lots, and struggling through a barrage of other cars. And so you'll have to excuse my amazement in being able to say that I was able to enter/exit the parking lot of the Ahmanson in about 5 minutes!On top of all this, both shows I saw at the theatre (""Porgy and Bess"" and ""The Last Confession"") were wonderful, and our seats provided a great view of the performers. I will say, however, that ""Porgy and Bess"" did suffer from several audio issues (it sounded like one of the singers was badly miked), which took down my score a little. Still, I would highly recommend the Ahmanson Theatre!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellE5725VO
50,A Far Cry From the Nokia,"I've been attending shows at the Ahmanson for years, but only recently has it occurred to me to post a review-- specifically a few nights ago, after attending the Closing Night performance of Peter and the Starcatcher. As we were leaving the complex, my husband commented upon how orderly things were, and how completely different from our last (horrific) experience attending the Nokia.For those not in the know, the Ahmanson is part of L.A.'s Music Center, consisting of (from north to south) the original Music Center consisting of The Ahmanson, The Mark Taper From and the elegant Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; and on the next block the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The center is basically right off the freeway and across from the County Courthouse. There are several levels of subterranean parking shared with the courthouse at a reasonable rate for downtown Los Angeles-- and additional parking beneath the Disney Center. Main parking is entered off of Grand Avenue and there valet/handicap parking available curbside on Hope Street.Early arrivals may find it pleasant (weather permitting) to either dine at the open air restaurant in the center of the complex, or to simply purchase wine or a snack from one of the bars catering to patrons. There are usually street entertainers, and the ever changing fountains in the courtyard to lull you into a pleasant state of relaxation. Relaxation in the heart of downtown Los Angeles is something of an art, and it's possible to achieve that quite nicely at the Music Center.Depending upon the configuration, I understand that the Ahmanson can seat between 1600 and 2084 people with wheelchair access available as well (call the Center Theatre Group directly for handicap seating information.) Acoustics, I am told, are surprisingly good for those with average hearing-- and for people like me, hearing devices are readily available. There are three levels of seating as well as boxes on the sides of the theatre, having occupied all the the above I would advise steering clear of the balcony (mezzanine is fine!) and the boxes (the angle is awkward and visibility poor.) Personnel is helpful and courteous and the entire experience is low key and pleasantly civilized. Really, it's a lovely place to spend an evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailg306
40,Nice Place to Visit a Starcatcher,"Recently my family and I went to see the play/musical, Peter and the Starcatcher at the Ahmanson Theater. The Play was great but I wanted to comment on the Ahmanson. Typically I'm not a fan of driving to Hollywood or Downtown LA to see a show. Downtown traffic and LA parking does not make for a nice pre-requisite for a wonderful evening but I must say the Music Center where the Ahmanson is located is not too bad. Located right off the freeway and with amble parking below the center it is a nice venue to visit and see a show. The theater itself is beautiful inside and out and with wonderful acoustics. Parking is very resonable and the escalators take you right to the theater entrance. Leaving was just as nice with theater associates directing traffic and monitoring heavy flow areas. You still need to give yourself some time to navigate the traffic but I wouldn't hesitate to visit the Ahmanson again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seeker55
40,Ahmanson Theatre at Los Angeles Downtown Music Center,"We went to see War Horse here on opening weekend, after I'd been absolutely obsessing over it since last year's Tony Awards. I almost made a special trip to NY just to see this play so I was thrilled when it came to Los Angeles. I live in the Valley, so there are a couple of options on getting to the actual theatre. After much debate, we decided to drive over taking the Metro, even though it's super convenient to where we live. Reason being, even though the metro drops you within walking distance to the Music Center, you have to walk up a pretty steep hill to actually get to your destination, and I had no desire to arrive at my much-anticipated show, a sweaty mess. Plus, the Metro can be great if you're up for an adventure but I just wasn't up for any surprises and more than once I've taken it only to find that the escalators are out of order and again, the sweaty mess thing just wasn't on my menu for the night.So, we were very lucky with traffic. We left about an hour and a half before showtime from our digs near Burbank so we'd have time to grab a bite. Once you're in Downtown, parking is a breeze but a small note of caution; if you drive a high profile vehicle, the Music Center parking lot has a very low clearance. Our SUV actually brushed the bottom of the clearance bar. Parking was $9 and it's under the Music Center proper. When you emerge upstairs there's an open plaza and on the night we were was what appeared to be an impromptu flash mob dance class. For food there's a bistro, the name escapes me, a pretty neat little upscale convenience store that offers fresh salads, individual cheese plates, little bottles of wine and other other drinks, and there's what I think is a little taco stand. There's also plenty of tables where, if you bring a picnic, you can have whatever you want and not worry about how much you want to spend. We hadn't taken too much time to plan, otherwise, that's what we might've done since I'm pretty good at putting together a picnic. We ended up eating at the Bistro/restaurant, which is okay... not very veg friendly, and you can't make any special requests I'm guessing that since efficiency is key at a place where the customers are on a strict timeline, most of the stuff is pre-made or at least pre-mixed. Unfortunately, the waitress brought me the wrong salad, but I ate it anyway because we couldn't flag her down and we didn't have time to hang around waiting. The salad I got was okay, just not what I wanted. BF had a burger and he really enjoyed it. The theatre itself is very nice, but if you're the type that needs something to nibble on while watching a show, I'd suggest bringing your own fare. Snack stand choices are very limited. Our performance was amazing, and we loved it. We were in the Mezzanine, a couple rows back, right in the center, so we had a good view but if I go see War Horse again (which I might) I may spring for Orchestra because I really want to be up close to those unbelievable puppets and near enough to the stage to see their expressions. Overall it was a fun experience, very easy overall, but definitely something that can be a real experience if you've done it once and gotten the lay of the land and can turn it into a night tailored to your own particular likes and needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenofLA
50,War Horse,"Saw The National Theater of Great Britain's production of War Horse in the Ahmanson Theater last night and the show was excellent. The ""star"" of the production, Joey, a full-sized horse puppet operated by three (sometimes six) people, is truly amazing. In fact, the entire cast is fantastic as we live through the drama of WWI, in Britain and France as seen through the lives of the people surrounding Joey...from a young colt to a fully grown horse ridden into battle by a young British officer. When is rider is killed, Joey falls into the kindly hands of German officer who saves the horse's life by taking him off the front lines. Joey struggles to survive as the 16-year old boy who raised him relentlessly looks for him amongst the dead men and animals. I promise a moving and happy ending. The Ahmanson is in downtown LA, just off the 101 freeway, with ample, comfortable, three-level seating, but not too large, so no matter where you sit, you feel part of the story/action. Pre-paid parking for events is $9 and is conveniently located under the facility with easy access and rapid escalators to take you up to the theater. Bar & snacks available before the show and at intermission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardJ3
50,See a Play support the Arts,"I have been a a subscriber for over 30 years. The Mark Taper has new and sometimes untested plays. It has brought new productions to the world Seats are not for the person with long legs, If you have long legs Check for the seats at the very back, or at the break between lower and upper seating. The theatre does have seats for ADA. For more traditional shows The Ahmanson would be your place. Musicals, both new and old make up the season. If you need to get a snack You can get soft Tacos, on the grounds or enjoy the fine dnining under the stars.The Center Theater Group does offer discount tickets to shows on a stand by for Students,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552StevenA
