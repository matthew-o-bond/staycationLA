40,A Cathedral for the Orthodox Christians from Syria,"Anchor for the Syrian community, this lovely cathedral sits on a hill overlooking the road, and includes an active school and community center. The church itself is open and quite charming. Majestic in its smallness, the focus is on the raised altar. The body of the church is bright, well lit, and I found the flat screen displays an indication of acceptance of technology.",Ken C
