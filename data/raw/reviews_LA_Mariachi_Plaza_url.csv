40,Beautiful Plaza filled with Music (on weekends!),"Mariachi bands gather here, especially on weekends, to show off their talents..many want to be hired to play somewhere. (apparently, this has been going on here since the 1930's!). Very convienient to get to...the subway entrance shares part of the plaza! No need to drive here...just get to the subway! The plaza itself is nice...there's a stage and open areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
