40,Visit the Pier as Part of Your Venice Boardwalk Adventure (B),"As piers go, the Venice pier is not particularly remarkable. There are nice restaurants at its base on Washington Street, but there is nothing on the pier itself. It's an easy and mostly level walk. The thing that gives the pier an extra star is that once you get out on it you have a sweeping view from Malibu to Ranch Palos Verdes. That's a whole lot of legendary SoCal beach to soak in. Don't miss the pier when you visit the Boardwalk and Canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGaucho1987
30,No frills,"Just a plain old concrete pier, it is longer that it looks from shore if you walk right to the end. There is of course the view back but that isnt up to much either.Mainly fisherman using it and thats probably all its for",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengel-IoW
50,Life is a beach in Venice.,"Venice Beach and Pier are the essential LA must. Locals and tourists alike enjoy this area of Los Angeles. Get your Pacific Ocean experience here, avoid the hassles of crowded Santa Monica. Plus there is already a new mural of Kobe Bryant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAmandaGreene

40,Met Up And Ate At Whaler,Nice walk out to grab a view of Venice Beach. Walked down towards Muscle Beach. Ate at the Whaler near pier. Food was very good. Got Whaler Burgers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825PaulB825
40,Free pier to walk on,"Nice to watch the sunset and the surfers. Occasionally see a boat or two. There are no attractions or restaurants on the pier, just the pier itself. Give it 20 minutes. No fee to walk on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norjeff2
30,The End of Venice,"Close as you can get to the ocean without getting wet, this portal for all people Venice attracts a diverse and interesting crowd, from families fishing with chairs set up, to half naked folks parading their tattoos and toned bodies, to off-beat clothing styles and unusual attire, it’s a good spot to see Venice sans retail. Go visit the ocean. Free to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,American Dream,"LA, Palms, Venice. Its a dream.One of the most well known spots in USA.You have to fell vibe.A lot of shops, restaurants etc.Some homeless as well, but all ppl very kind and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacobPia
50,Good place for looking around,"A no-frills pier with no attractions or shelter, so go late afternoon to see the fishers and surfers and the city bathed in light. Always busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
50,A great place to walk and watch the sights.,A good place to fish or just take a walk. Sunsets are great here and so is the view in every direction. Easy to get to with parking close by and $9 a day on the beach side. The pier access is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenotheViking
50,nice spot to look across the Bay,"No fancy rollercoaster or ferris wheel here, just a bunch of anglers and locals and few tourists taking in a fresh breeze of the Pacific Ocean. It’s a good spot to watch surfers catching the rolling waves and to look back across the Bay to Santa Monica if you made the 5km walk from there. You can park at North Venice public parking just 20m from the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntalabany
40,Good Walk down Pier,"Venice Beach Pier, nice walk down Pier and great stores down main street. Worth checking out and can spend a day, morning or a couple hours for a quick trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcG7748ZT
30,NOT SO NICE,We visited Pier when we went to Venice beach. There were lots of street formers along the Boardwalk. We explored only a little and did not appear very good to me. The area was not so clean and price appeared exorbitantly high. Instead we came back to beach again which was quite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DPMALLIC
40,Great place to watch both surfers and aircraft,"This is one of my absolute favorite beach spots because you get a great view of the surfers and, if you look to the south, you often get a great view of all of the planes taking off from LAX—you get steady entertainment. Being somewhat south of the heart of Venice Beach, the crowds are a little smaller down here, though many of the amenities are still present—don’t worry, there’s a Starbucks about a block from the foot of the pier. If you make the walk down from the monstrous parking garages near Muscle Beach and are too tired to walk back, I promise there are piles of Bird and Lime scooters everywhere that you can make it back on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eightwednesday
30,Hold your nose,"This thing is kind of a dump. Smells like dead fish and urine. Trash everywhere. There are a lot of people fishing off the side, even though there are signs saying the fish is probably contaminated. Lots of homeless people hanging around.I guess worth the 10 minute walk to the end to feel the breeze and enjoy the view, but not much more than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raychampagne
40,Extend Your Walk,We only explored a little way up the Pier but it is a nice extension to any walk around the Venice area. A little less busy than the boardwalk and free of bikes it affords nice views back along the sand in both directions. Lots of fisherman at play fit people jogging in the sun. A nice place to check out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath

30,Fishing pier,"If you like to fish, this is a great place to go. The pier is made for it. No benches or stuff for visitors, though. Bring your own, if you want. Can view surfers and folks enjoying the beach - also view the never ending stream of airplanes leaving LAX. We were hoping to see sea lions or whales, but no dice. Maybe some other time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cello12345

40,Great to see!,Made a visit here today for the first-time ever. Quite a few people walking it as well as fishing off the sides. Plenty of birds there as well. Great views of the surrounding beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidson168
30,Fine Stroll at Sunset,Nice ocean views at sunset. Quite crowded with fishermen and smells like fish and seagull poop. Wouldn't go out of my way to visit but if in the area it's worth a few minutes at sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/downslopewind
40,Boho beach life with a California twist,Start your day here around 11:00am in one of the boardwalk cafe taking in the beauty of the sea air and feeling the benefits of the relaxed atmosphere as you listen to the sea breeze. By mid-day you will be watching locals set up there stalls and music stands with wonderful delights and arts and crafts that will catch your eye. Walking along the boardwalk and beach you will feel a energy from others which include the Californian beach babes and roller bladed along with the skater kids and La fitness working out will make you get your peddle on and hire a bike to cycle the stretch of Venice beach . Stopping for lunch is easy with great choices or restaurants and cafes with excellent selection on menus . You won't leave without taking a pit stop at the skate park and then muscle beach where a crowd sets in to watch those who work out hard in the famous part of the beach. As sunsets music plays harder and reflection for the sea fills you with joy as those around start to party . You won't leave without a souvenir from one of the locals and a feeling of happiness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barefootafree
40,Smaller pier,"A smaller pier than Santa Monica Pier, anyways it has relaxing atmosphere, cooling winds at hot summer day and you have nive view to sea or to beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
40,Venice Pier!,"Certainly not the nearby Santa Monica Pier, but the Venice Pier despite being much smaller, you can still take a walk to admire the beautiful beaches on both sides. If you go in the afternoon, wait for the sunset because it is a less crowded place and enjoy one of the best shows of California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
40,Nice spot to watch surfers and kids playing among the waves,"It was late morning (Jan 29th) by the time we left the beach and went to walk on the pier. Loved the views of the ocean as we walked up. My son was surprised to find fishing was allowed and really wanted to try his hand, but our time was limited. We had to be at the Staples Centre for noon. I loved the views of the beach and shoreline even more as we walked back. Great spot to watch surfers! Could have easily spent a couple of hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib981
30,Hardly the most beautiful pier along the coast,"Get away from all quirky goings-on along its iconic beachfront boardwalk,Somewhat calmer on the pier. An unforgettable scene of local characters and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
40,Functional pier,"The Venice Pier is in a beautiful and scenic setting. It's a relaxing place to stroll and enjoy the views. It was not busy at all when we were there, maybe a handful of people late in the afternoon. Good fishing pier. Pleasant but plain (compared to Santa Monica up the coast).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014

30,Venice should deserve a better pier,"Venice is fantastic, the Pier of Venice it's quite sad. Probably one of the worst in the L.A. area. It deserves a visit only to see Venice and L.A. from the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
50,Nice walk after drinks,Great walk at sunset after drinks. Very crowded but worth the view. Lots of tourists taking pictures and stopping randomly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lchez55

50,Take a nice sunset walk on the Venice pier,"We like to walk on the pier at sunset and watch the fishermen, surfer, swimmers and people. Great family activity or couple or with friends.

30,Long pier,It is a long pier when on a good day would have interesting views of the coast on a good day. There isn't any amenities like a restaurant on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8epilot
50,Incredible place,What a wonderful place to relax and have fun. Even if you don't like to swim you can enjoy this place with all the scenic views it has. All kind of diverse people which makes the beach a multicultural place.The beach is clean and though it can be crowdy it is still an awesome place to visit. Be prepared to look for a Peking spot if you don't wish to pay $20 flat rate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBenjamin74
30,Although I gave a 3 it deserves a walk!,"The reason I gave this attraction a 3 is because of another Pier we have in LA, the Santa Monica one.As Santa Monica has a 5, the Venice pier could not get any grade but 3.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlosgustavoribeiro

50,Fun little walk!,Nice views! A local showed us the natural amphitheatre at the end of the pier. If you stand in the middle of the circle at the end it really echoes. The kids has a blast yelling and clapping ( sorry everyone else 😬).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6ettin-out-there-
40,Sunday stroll,The Venice beach pier is a nice place to take a Sunday stroll. The pier is several blocks south of muscle beach and the busy section of Venice beach. The whole area is a bit congested north of the pier and not quite as nice as Manhattan beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235danp
50,The Pier,Not as fancy or as big as Huntington but still beautiful views. Always worth the walk and the people watching was great. Lots of locals fishing all the way down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TooAmigos

It's best at sunset for great views and sky colors. Worth a quickie visit if in the area. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Amazing,We stopped here during our road trip and so pleased we did the views are well worth the trip. There are also places to eat and shop here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hebe_7
40,Never knew about the pier,"I did not know Venice Beach had a pier. I am familiar with the board walk and decided to check this place out. There is a large parking lot at the foot of the pier. It is large compared to other pier parking lots but it is probably the most expensive one in the region. The road leading to the pier has places to eat but around the pier itself, not much. The morning I visited it was mostly tourist walking around, locals biking or walking by, or people fishing. There is not much here compared to other local piers. For me, I walked it and enjoyed the views. Like other piers along the coast here, they are great places to catch a sunset. You can look north and see Venice Beach Pier. South is Manhattan and Redondo Beach. You can also see airplanes departing from LAX.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619Joey
