30,Wouldn't choose to stay again,"We stayed here because it was close to a clinic we were visiting. Not much to do or places to eat, but it was reasonably priced and the bus to get to downtown easy to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60emilyr
50,Fantastic Beach.,"We've been visiting the Los Angeles area more frequently as our daughter is attending college there. So, we've been exploring the various beaches. Playa Del Rey is actually my favourite. Not a lot of amenities in the surrounding area but the beach is less populated and the parking is easy. So, if you jst want to chill in the sun and watch the waves, Play Del Rey is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
50,Can't wait to come back!,Amazing beach! My family of four had so much fun staying in a rental near by. We loved it so much we have plans to come back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizhawkinsnelson
20,quick visit,I was early picking someone up at LAX and I thought it might be nice to walk on the beach here. I was annoyed that I had to pay the full $8 daily rate even though I arrived at 6pm a few hours before it becomes free. There are no real amenities just a bathroom. Nothing to eat so not good if you are hungry! there were lots of kids having Bbq and fire pits which was nice for them but I didn't feel totally safe being there alone. I guess daytime vibes would be better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446anjums
50,What a beach!,"Loved the wide beach. Lots of areas to change, shower and cook. The best part was the long and wide bike path. Wish I had a bike with me as I would have enjoyed riding and watching the sun come down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhatPatW
40,Worth your time,"I have occasionally been on the beach now and then. It is never really crowded like Santa Monica, so the environment here is chilled and relaxed, especially when you come for the sunset. If you are into bikes, that's a bonus because the bike path is really good. However, the only issue is that parking is limited here, so that may be a problem during the weekends. Otherwise it is worth spending your time here, watching the waves and enjoying the sky and the air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaway798488
50,Wonderful Beach,"Beautiful beach with soft sand and not a lot of people. We really enjoyed seeing the planes take off from LAX as well. Perfect temperature, great breeze and very good waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
50,Fantastic Beach,"The beach at Playa Del Rey is fantastic ... a nice wide soft sand beach. Life guard station nearby with a decent public restroom. Free Parking can be a challenge but the pay lots are reasonably priced. The surrounding town is sleepy but grab a burger at “The Shack,” just Ben open-minded about the restaurant’s condition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
40,GREAT each,"Of course, you have to like beaches! Great concrete walkway/ bike Way! Sand is soft and beach is amazing. You can stroll and enjoy the water views or enjoy the beach houses... wishing one was yours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TigerSouthCarolina
50,Majestic!,Such a beautiful area! Recommended for anyone that has never seen the west coast or the ocean! The sand is very fine and soft!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Copdrew
30,Beautiful beach but noisy,"If you like hearing planes fly over every 2 mins then this is the beach for you. We went because all the reviews talked about how nice and quite (not over crowded) it was, and how beautiful it was (which it was). But on our last day in Cali we went so that way I could lay on the beach to relax and hear the sound of the waves crashing in for a few hours. But that didn't last very long since this is the closest beach to the LAX airport. Which means there is a plane flying directly over you every 2 mins. Killed my whole vibe! Very nice beach but too noisy for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djs379
50,"Awesome, King of the Beach or the Beach of Kings, really great bikepath, etc!","Great Bike Path, Beautiful Sunrises and Sunsets, Awesome Restaurants, chill vibe, cool people...A precious Gem of a beach, you can find parking generally....PLAYA ROCKS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danieleE1277ZQ
50,"Quiet & Secluded, Very Near Hip Town Restaurants & Shops","You have to include a stroll to this beach, spend the day, or hope to find a nearby rental or stay at the small Inn at Playa del Rey. It is not like other area beaches; it holds some different mysteries of the ocean since it is next to the marina inlet and a hidden duck pond just steps from the beach. When you are ready to be treated to food, there are several admirable restaurants nearby -- Bacari is among the most inventive, while The Shack is a typical beach/surf spot -- as well as some coffee shops and pool bars. I enjoy this less touristy beach spot. Easy place to kick back, meditate and enjoy. Here I can unwind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2016Patti
50,"Nice, chilled out beach","We spent a great day at the beach being it our first day in Los Angeles. Weather was great, beach was nice & clean and some great eateries nearby. Parking is a little tricky though. Go to Playa Provisions (just off the beach) for great food & drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Walksy22
40,Close to LAX and pretty clean.,"This is a pretty chill beach. Not a lot of overwhelming foot traffic, but if you're looking to relax without much noise then this is a pretty good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth
50,"Playa Del Rey Beach, near LAX","I was departing from LAX and ensured I had time to see the Pacific Ocean. Less than 15 minutes from the airport straight west of the airport on Imperial Highway. As you approach the beach, you feel that your driving off the edge of the earth into the ocean. It's an amazing view. Worth the time and drive before departure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8158KAbrendaj
20,Boring,"Beautiful beach but nothing there, no concession or food carts, water is coldNo bike rentals or anything",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dsheridan2015

40,Nice clean beach,Nice beach for a game of volleyball or ride along the cycle path. Plane watch as the planes take off from LAX right over head.Nice clean beach to picnic on or swim in the waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854DP
50,Great escape from the city,Always visit here when in town. Enjoy walking on the beach sand and paved trail with the ocean breeze. I've seen dolphins in the area. Clean and vibrant beach with beautiful ocean front homes along the paved trail. Colorful evening sunsets worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inoque1

40,Nice beach!,"A very beautiful beach, much less crowded than the nearby Santa Monica or Venice Beach, with the exception of the planes that will pass just a few meters over your head because of the proximity to the airport. The surrounding area is really petty as well which makes it definitely a place to visit and spend a good sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
50,Clean beach; hidden gem near LAX; the sunset!,"Known to locals, this beach is clean with well-maintained bicycle and walking paths. Home to USA Volleyball and amateur volleyball players, fun to watch. Crowded on weekends. Lots of sail boats when windy. Good surf waves. So close to LAX you can watch planes take off and see what country they are from. Nice pier. The smallest aquarium ever on one of the piers. Locals & tourists gather at sunset to watch the sunset. The hills of Malibu can be seen and with the setting sun, it's spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenmalley
40,Beautiful beach walk,"Gorgeous beach, clean toilets, well maintained volleyball courts. Just be careful not to get stuck the wrong side of the sandbank as the tide comes in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anise76
50,A gem of a beach!,"Down the coastline from the crowded beaches of Santa Monica and Venice, lies a hidden gem called Playa Del Rey. It is a cute little beach town with great restaurants and a clean stretch of the beach. It's not too tough to find parking but you can bike to the beach too. The beach is family friendly and closeby is a lagoon, drought stricken but good for bird watching. There is a kids park there too. All in all, an easy outing for family with young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rumblingstrips
50,"An Idyllic Clean (nearly private) Beach Community, just minutes from LAX! Who Knew?","What a terrific discovery near Los Angeles!Secret Gem of a beach!With the bonus of bike paths, Ocean Front Rental Homes, sail boats, yachts, regattas, sealions, postcard perfect sunsets and breathtaking views.Quiet, peaceful, soothing location for vacation or staycation rentals. Suitable for singles, families, friends, anyone looking for a relaxing, non-commercialized beach retreat!Can't wait to return soon and often :-) !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6
40,"Sand and Surf, Bikes and Boats and Jets","This beach is relatively uncrowded, because parking is limited and the beach is wide. Years ago, it was a popular surfing beach, but there seem to be fewer surfers now, although the waves seem about the same.The beach itself is wide and made of grey-brown medium grain sand excavated from the Marina just north. It's good for sand castles and burying each other, and if you bring a magnet, you'll find it has a pretty high magnetite content (black Fe3O4 grains). Sometimes there are black patches that are almost pure magnetite. During the winter, the county puts up a protective berm in front of the houses just south of Culver Blvd, and the locals bring out snow saucers and slide down the face for a short but fun ride.The surf varies depending on tide and wave conditions, as well as the current shape of the bottom. When it's just right, the surfing (body or board) can be fine. Low tide is usually the best time when the waves are small. High tide often has a very short shore break, good for swimmers but useless for surfers.Marina del Rey (a large small-boat harbor) lies just north, and the boats from it are continually passing by offshore. LAX airport lies just south, and the planes take off over the water during normal wind conditions; the noise isn't too loud, but is often noticeable. The bike path (Marvin Braude Bike Trail) passes by, as well, and sometimes you'll see exotic bicycles.Free parking is available just north of Culver Blvd along the front road. It fills up fairly quickly, though. There are a few small pay lots in the area, but they fill up quickly too. If you want to combine a trip to the beach with a bike ride, the bike path offers a good way to avoid the parking risk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leifb763
50,"Beautiful Beach, Love seeing the Planes!! A hidden Gem!","This is now one of my fav beaches in LA. It is a hidden gem for sure!! Hardly anyone there while I was visiting. There is Free Parking at del Rey Lagoon on Pacific Ave at 66th Ave. Oh the Lagoon was not much to look at when I was there. The actually beach is beautiful and the view of the Pacific Ocean is breath taking. Please watch for waves and the under current is strong!! Lots of volley ball nets. Being a student pilot I loved seeing the Planes on take off. They don't take off directly over the beach, just South of it. I didn't notice any Airplane noise. I did notice there was absolutely no pets on the beach, so I'm guessing it is a no pets allowed beach. This is really a great beach and the surrounding area is very cool. I've made note to stay here on my next visit. I've added some pictures I took with my mobile, so things appear farther away than actually are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/attagirl_007
40,Kind of a hidden gem in L.A.,"I work in the area, and I wanted to let people know what a nice location this is, away from the huge crowds of Venice and Santa Monica beaches, just north of this spot.You can usually find parking here, for free, and there is a peaceful park nearby with a lagoon, as well as a wonderful bike path that stretches from Redondo Beach all the way up to Pacific Palisades.My favorite thing to do is park my car in PDR, and take my bike along the beach bike path to whichever popular beach location for a nice meal or just to enjoy the ride.It is also a good spot to head out towards the Marina Del Rey harbor inlet, to watch some sailboats and competitive rowing. And of course, the beach itself is nice and relaxing, too.There are nice restaurants in Playa Del Rey, for all types of cuisine. From a divey sportsbar hangout called The Shack to a fancy wine bar called Bacari PDR and everything in between, there are lots of places to choose from. The town is very quaint and cute and still pretty laid back considering the population increase over the past several years. It still carries it's charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/underneathy
50,great plane-spotting at the beach!,"Playa Del Ray is one of those places that you don't really think of as a tourist destination, but it's definitely worth a visit in my opinion, if only to see all the planes taking off from LAX.Honestly, this place is mainly for joggers and bikers to exercise along the water. Certainly. But the attraction for me was being directly next to LAX airport and seeing all the huge and small planes coming to land and also take off. Because they just take off right across the road from the beach, the planes are extremely close and it was very cool.The beach itself is clean and you can walk for miles, so it's good for exercise as well. But the best aspect for me was definitely the plane spotting. It's like those people camping out at airports, but you're right on the ocean with sand instead of concrete and fences!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer099
50,Best Beach in LA,"Marina del Rey is amazing, and it's mainly because of Playa del Rey. We were there in October, and every single day the beach was nearly empty, and every sunset was absolutely spectacular. Not much as far as amenities, but we had a little AirBnB place right on the water so we didn't care. Perfect, can't wait to go there again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BexBurbs

40,Great Hidden Beach ...,"The beach at Playa Del Rey is actually hard to find and that's OK with the locals who want to keep it a secret. Once you visit though you'll be a regular because it has quintessential California beach beauty & even sand dunes, which are lacking in Venice & Santa Monica. You'll enjoy plus nice restaurants closely nearby. Enjoy the secret beach! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
