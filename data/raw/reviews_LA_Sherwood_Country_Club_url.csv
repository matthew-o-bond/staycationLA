50,Most under discovered golf course in California.,"The professional staff is great, Nick, the head professional, is a rockstar. The course is lush with beautiful tree lined fairways. The greens are fast and smooth. From the tips it will challenge anyone. The food is extremely well done with highest of service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dphwlv
50,"Great course, great facility, great people","Iâ€™ve been a member since 2010, played s lot of other courses in my lifetime but few compare to Sherwood. Meticulously groomed and maintained, outstanding caddies, great camaraderie and friendly service and members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doncusick
50,Pure Pleasure,"Sherwood lives up to its label as a premium private course.The course is challenging but not rigorous. The fairways are evenly cut and it's hard not to have a perfect lie. The greens are moderately fast and true. The staff service is polite and accommodating.All in all, a very satisfying round of golf!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282daved
50,"A new golf course, improved service result in a great day","Sherwood Country Club has undergone a significant renovation on the golf course front, and the result is an outstanding and polished test of golf in one of the great natural settings in America. Original course designed Jack Nicklaus was brought in to do a total makeover of the original design, resulting in the course being closed for a year. The finished product is now completed, and he has taken an original gem, and brought it to new heights. The layout of the course is significantly the same, but the details and course infrastructure are much improved. Nicklaus has taken some of the undulation out of the original greens, moved bunkers, repositioned some greens entirely and restored native California grasses.The result is an exquisite golf experience, with a spectrum of challenge from pro tee's (with Bear tee markers) to a range of tee's that will challenge golfers of all levels. I'm a regular 90's golfer and found the blue tees to be a fair test. The traps are fully white, the fairways fair and the rough very, well, rough. The greens may have less undulation, but if you are not in the fairway off the tee, it is unlikely you will reach the green in regulation. Such is the thickness and depth of the rough now.Each hole is it's own entire chapter in a round of golf. You never see another fairway next to yours, and wildlife abounds, as I saw heron, a hawk and a herd of deer during my round.This is an experience to savor if you are fortunate enough to play. Arrive early to enjoy the spectacular golf range, with an attendant there to offer you water, clean your clubs and accommodate any needs. Stay late and enjoy the men's locker room, which is anything but a locker room, with a full restaurant and bar, and the requisite TV's all over the walls. Hot tub? Sauna? Work out? No problem.If you get the chance, go. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Socalicouple
50,Exquisite Club,"Sherwood CC is a private club with views of the Santa Monica mountains and next to famous Lake Sherwood. Therefore, one must come with a member or apply for membership. The Jack Nicholas course has just been completely redone. The renovation has taken over a year. It will open to members on March 3, 2016. Shortly there will be a new & state of the art workout facility. There is an olympic size swimming pool, professional tennis courts including grass & clay. It is a superb wedding destination. A new world class GM has just been hired to take Sherwood CC into it's best years ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenleslieo

50,Awesome course that no one ever plays,"Watched the course many times on TV, and now I know what they hold tournaments like that there. It was a very nice track, and there was hardly anyone there. Of course you need to have a member play along or you pay $500, but I can't understand why it doesn't get more play. We had a great young fore caddy who read all our putts and gave us important info on every shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msulli2

The club was chosen for the outdoor venue and we were not disappointed.The club is an beautiful location with beautiful scenery and excellent views. The club house it self is has very nice ambiance and high degree of sophistication and elegance. The staff were very discreet and not intrusive at all and facilitated the wedding without any hitch. An outside catering company was hired that provided high quality and tasty food and event management with the country club so the whole event was delivered to high standard from start to finish.The Club, staff and their service and collaboration with catering staff was faultless. An excellent wedding reception at an excellent venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdul7829

50,Beautiful place to have an event,"Our family have been members at this club since 1993. Having been to many of their events I can honestly say this is a first class establishment. From weddings to prom parties, from BBQ's to their annual Halloween party Sherwood really knows how to do it right!I would highly Reccomend booking your next party here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parisc_13
50,Perfect PGA experience,"Spent three soggy but fantastic days at the World Challenge 2012. The course was unbelievable, the support staff were beyond helpful and the clubhouse was picture worthy. It was quite obvious that the staff take great care to ensure that all of the details of a professional course are maintained. Loved the layout of the course and the par three holes that made for some great golf intensity. I hope that this course is home to many future tournaments, I would definately come back for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrotherBoggs
50,"Not sure it's an attraction, but it's first class for sure!","The golf course is PGA quality and tough, the clubhouse is one of the more spectacular ones in the pantheon of private clubs in America, and overall this is one ""must do"" if you get the chance. The private gates of Sherwood don't open for everyone, such is the price of an exclusive club in any city. But if you find yourself on the inside, the experience is one to treasure.The grounds of the golf course can rival the finest courses for attention to detail and scenery. The course itself will never rival the top 20 courses in America because there just isn't the distanced from tee to green given how the layout was done. There is still plenty to love on the Jack Nicklaus designed track, and if you go long or wide on the greens, the penalty is severe. Each hole is it's own work of art and singular experience. To tee it up here and survive 18 holes with a good score is a good accomplishment for any golfer.The locker room is one for the ages. The amenities make it the kind of place if you had one hour you want two. The 19th hole is as good as it gets. If you get a chance to see the Tennis Club, take it. Clay, grass or synthetic courts are all ready to go, as well as an Olympic pool and a great English Pub and outdoor dining deck.Sherwood is life as it should be, and if you get to linger on the grounds and enjoy the facility, it's a treat worth indulging fully in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Socalicouple

50,Only for the rich and famous,"I have been fortunate to be a guest here a few times, although I have not played golf (only an observer). The food is excellent and the golf course greens look like velvet! If you get a chance to go here, don't stay home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraJ48
50,New ownership,"Sherwood is 5 stars now that the old idiot billionaire owner is gone and the place is owned by the members. The golf course is incredible, the food was terrific, and the staff was friendly.I highly recommend Sherwood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGolf23
20,Poor customer service,"The club has beautiful grounds and well-appointed common areas (i.e. banquet halls, lounges, bathrooms, terrances, etc.). However, the customer service is less than impressive. My fiancee and I were considering dropping over $50,000.00 for a wedding at the venue, but seriously questioned the ability of the club to serve our needs. The catering department failed to return our calls on multiple occasions and the club was somewhat uncooperative in scheduling an appointment for us to see the grounds when we couldn't reach the main contact person. Overall, if any bride-to-be hopes to receive superior treatment and cooperation in selecting a wedding location, I would discourage any dealings with this venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revelty
