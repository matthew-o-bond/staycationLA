10,"Rude staff, discriminate, anti gay","This is a Great Lake to spend time with your loved ones. Few years back I had come her for 3+ years and always had a great experience. It's really sad during these very difficult times to experience there current staff. I have not felt more discriminated and treated so rude from the moment I pulled up to the lake. Gentleman came up to us without a mask and I said good morning. His response was your not coming on this lake? So if your gay they don't want you. We continue to drive up where luckily the booth had mask and where kind as usual. When we got to the inspection the woman Santiago, immediately popped off on us with rude comments. I was calm and cool and shocked at her being nasty. We then where told are boat past the inspection but we were not allowed Because we had stop to let are French bulldogs out of the car and move the inner tubes into the truck to make there inspection easer. She said because we stop we could be hiding something? Is that a part of there city Rules when it comes to inspection or they are just harassing us??? I understand they have to turn people away and we where coming from Lake arrowhead where it's a private lake. But there is no reason to not be kind and respectful. They need to find jobs they are good at and not discriminate at this lake. It's terrible she is not only nasty and rude she is not putting a face mask on and going to infect people with Covid 19.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatMacMan
30,Nice outdoor space,"Came to Castaic Lagoon on Sunday, and it was really quiet. Not many people at all, maybe because the season is over and the lagoon is closed (no one’s allowed in the water). Either way, it was really nice and peaceful. Note that before leaving we went to the lake side and there were boats in the water and it seemed a little more busy.Parking fee is $11 which seems a little pricey for the location and the overall condition of the grounds. But it’s fine.The ground are decent. They have a small strip of sand along the lagoon, but it’s a little rocky too. They also have green space with playgrounds for kids. There are 5-6 of them along the main sidewalk at different spots. And there are a bunch of spots with bbq pits.It’s a nice outdoor space with options for families to bbq, kids to play in sand and/or at the playground, and walk the path. Worth coming again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009
10,awful,Very rude & unprofessional employees. Worst of all was the manager who was no help & cursed too. really bad attitude from staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skier234
50,Great time,"Had a great time catching fish, however weekends can get a little crowded. Share the lake and pick up your trash... or other trash you may see. Keep it nice and it will last!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilfredoj991
40,Good clean fun,I love coming to Castaic lake and Castaic lagoon. I often rent a fishing dingy at the upper lake and get some fishing in. On the lower lake aka the lagoon ( 8 feet or longer on upper lake for experienced people only) I like to bring my kayaks and cruise around. We often BBQ here as well. Unlike the upper lake there is plenty of restrooms and tables to hang out at so you can bring s group and have a few out on the water while people grill on the beach. This is a county park so you’re not allowed to consume alcohol on premises but alcohol and water sports don’t mix well anyways. And there is a few spots close by to get a sting margarita if needed. You can fish from lower lagoon as well but there is a lot of carp. Living close by means I get to enjoy the lake often. It does get crowded on weekends and during summer. But it’s still a good spot for a day in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottydoesntknow661
50,Beautiful lake- peaceful RV parking,"We had no hookups here, but it was a great place for RV parking for a couple of days. Our site overlooked the lake and we enjoyed gorgeous sunsets. Convenient for all lake activity -- if you want to fish, hike, bike or boat. We did some hiking -- the Fisherman Trail on the other side of the lake is wonderful. Peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El_Retiro
30,Nice giveaways at check in.,"The young man in the office checked us in promptly and handed us some useful giveaways - pen light, multi-tool bottle opener, drinking water in a sleeve and a pen. Overall the streets in the park are narrow and it appears most of the residents are long term - Lots of ""cluttery stuff"" around the rigs. The pool and very large hot tub were immaculately clean, a very nice discovery. We stayed over one night and would do so again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlstrong2017
40,Nice View,Well maintained Nice View Good place for all age group Entry fee is high Boating is available too Staff is very helpful Visited as we were staying at LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorabh

40,Nice to visit,"When there for a family gathering and it was very nice. Picnic area was spacious.Swimming area was a bit small but kids enjoyed it. Nice place to walk and explore.Kayaking, Standing Paddle board and Hydro bikes available to rent. Workers very helpful and friendly. Would visit again.Bathrooms like Most public places can use a little more attention to maintain them clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NY-twintoes
50,Fun and safe place for entire family,Well maintained. Staff is right on top of things and always very helpful. The park is well kept and their events are Always fun and successful. I've lived right next door for 17 yrs and have never been disappointed going there. A fun and safe place for the entire family from use of park to boating and being a part off their special events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73neila
10,Paddle boarding adventure turned nightmare,Horrible place to visit. First went to upper lake. After 30 minutes of inflating both paddle boards we were promptly kicked out of the upper lake. The lifeguard was friendly but we saw no signs saying such craft were banned from the upper lake. After breaking everything back down we were sent to the lower lagoon. Upon reaching the lagoon the booth attendant told us our inflatable boards failed inspection because they were wet. These boards were brand new in the box 30 minutes prior to launch in the upper lake. After calling the upper lake to confirm he informed us that the launch fee is $7 per board...a motor boat is $13 to launch(why would we pay more for 2 unpowered vessels!) Lack of signs and regulation notices confirmed we will never return or spend any money at these facilities. DO NOT USE THIS LAKE. A $7 fee will be charged to every non motorized thing including inflatable mattresses and even inflatable whales for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbyl790
40,Great place to walk the dog on leash please!,We love to walk the dog on weekends around the lake. If you park outside then there is no price to go in. Makes you feel like you are on a vacation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracyandjjtravels
40,Recreation and SoCal water survival is what Caustic and Pyramid lakes are all about.,"I came here to learn about water not do the recreation stuff.Lake is sometimes closed to public.Built to generate power and move water in the California aqueduct system.Incredible visitors center to teach about water, moving water, dam building and power plants. Frightening how reliant we are on the aqueduct.Recreation and SoCal water survival is what Caustic and Pyramid lakes are all about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Great place to go and just get away,"Great place to camp for a nice little get a way. Just north of the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles and the San Fernado Valley. If your from out of town and traveling the country in an RV or just tent camping and roughing it. Everything is within a 10 minute drive.The stores are close by as well as nice restaurants, boat repair and camping supplies. I have moved out of the area I would check if they added showers to their facilities. Nice campgrounds nice atmosphere. Depending on if you get a bad group of campers next to you. The Rangers patrol the campgrounds and make sure no one is going to be a problem. If you and your group becomes a problem the Sheriffs will remove you. If you have a boat or want to rent one the upper lake is great for trolling for trout. If you like to throw bass plugs head for the lower lake(the lagoon) next to the bridge the first one you come across when you come off the interstate. There is a parking lot right across the street. There are other lakes close by Lake Piru or better yet Lake Pyramid just 20 miles up Interstate 5. All with campgrounds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888jima
30,Peacefull and quiet,"You pay just for parking. I was only in lagoon, but it is a nice getaway from the city, however it is quite busy on the weekend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EugeneKubrak
40,"Lovely Lake, Nice Facilities","Easy to get to - just a mile or so off I-5 north of Santa Clarita. We went 8am on a Monday morning and practically had the park to ourselves. We enjoyed walking around the lagoon and watching Canada geese, then drove up to the lake to enjoy the scenery. Entrance fee is $11/car on weekends and holidays, but we paid $5 for senior/disabled since it was a weekday (a great bargain!). There are two sections: the (smaller) lagoon in front of the dam and the larger lake behind it. The lagoon area has sandy beaches for swimming, picnic areas and paved walkways to some vista points. There is a campground on the east side of the lagoon. The lake also has a picnic area and is perhaps more suitable for boating than the lagoon due to its larger size. There are over 7 miles of trails to explore. Restrooms are available in several locations. The water level is low because of the drought and there are currently some restrictions for boating, swimming and fishing so check the website before you go. Maps are available on the website as well. We spoke to a friendly maintenance worker who told us that the park is very busy and crowded on weekends. Wheelchair access includes designated parking in the beach and picnic areas, restrooms, paved walkways with ramps, drinking fountains and picnic sites. Accessible fishing pier is available at the campground entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
50,Relaxing,My friends and I were just in town to go to Six Flags and happened to find the lake. We did not know it was there but we are happy we found it. We were upset that the beach was closed but it was January so it was too chilly to even go into the lake anyway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smashley7
40,"For outdoor enthusiasts, especially those on bikes.","The water level at the lower lake is low because of the drought and the water has been re-routed to another lake. There's still miles of bike paths and picnic areas. Drought closed the lake to swimming, but people are still camping and boating on upper lake. If you want to swim, head south on Castaic Road to the Community Swimming area which is 3 large pools, biggest in all of Santa Clarita. From the Lake Hughes Road side of the lake, park across the street from the church and hike a short one to a shady picnic area long ago closed because the entrance road eroded during a rain storm. Beautiful views, especially as the sun goes down. Check with the Lake info center to see if they still offer night kayaks in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilief2014
50,Great Recreation Area,"My eldest son and I spent the Saturday of the MLK holiday here fishing. This was our first visit to Castaic Lake and I am impressed.We arrived at the recreation area about 9:30 AM. Note that there is an entrance fee of $11. I was surprised to see that there were just a few other folks there - maybe about a dozen to 20 cars total. No cyclists or hikers - just a few of us fishing - maybe half on the lake in boats and half shore fishing (which we did). Consequently, it made for a really nice, quiet, day with my son. This is a beautiful park that, while just ten minutes from the Five Freeway, feels really far away. The lake is surrounded by the mountains and is really quiet. Just a light breeze most of the day and the sound of the occasional boat.The recreation area has hiking trails, bbq and picnic areas, a kids playground, geocaching, boating, and fishing. A little bit of everything for everyone. As other reviewers have mentioned, the California drought has really affected the water level in the lake so you have hike down a bit to find a good place to fish. Nothing difficult but it is a bit surprising to see how low the water level is. Since we arrived late to fish, we didn't catch anything although we also noted that none of the other parties were having any luck either. Fish took the day off as well, I guess.The restrooms were standard public restrooms ... you get the idea. Check in with the guy at the main boat launch store for bait and last minute tackle and to get an idea of what, if anything, is biting.We called it a day at 1:30PM since NOTHING was biting and decided to do some geocaching before getting lunch. For those of you into geocaching there are a number of geocaches in this area. It's a good location for them and my son's ""geosense"" was working that day - he located three out of three Dad didn't find them.Bring a camera long as well, as the views can be really impressive.I would definitely return here for another day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6633PYpauls
40,Great lake for fishing and water sports.,"Castaic Lake is currently 100 ft low from it's usual full capacity. You can bring in your boat, kayak or personal water craft. There is currently no swimming allowed due to the low water level. Cars cost $11 to enter, kayaks cost $7.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wvillamil
40,Fun day,"We recently visited Castaic and were happy with our choice. A few downsides...the water level is very low this year, some of the people we encountered were not the highest quality of people, and the bathrooms were trashed by the end of the day. (Absolutely disgusting). There were a few times where we were a bit nervous to get in the water as other boats often came way too close for comfort. On the plus side, the day we went, the lake was not very crowded. The water appeared clean and was nice and warm. It was not an exceptionally hot day (90`s) but I don't think anybody even thought of grabbing a towel. The rates are comparable to other lakes we have visited. In order to get to the boat launch, there is a very steep hill. There are lifeguards available to assist if necessary. We would definitely visit again...just not on a crowded weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419lindseyh
40,Seems to be a good place for anglers,"Lake is low. The main dam is a good fishing spot. We arrived late and did not catch anything but we saw people there with five or six in the basket. West ramp region has some people fishing too but it is not quite accessible. Mosquito could be a problem around sunset time, they are just bombers. One thing that is not great is that fishing places and picnic areas are far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saturnhp
20,Refreshing Lake but Rude people,"Lake is low, but the boat ramps are crowded, a lot of angry inconsiderate people loading boats and unloading. They really do not know Boat etiquette. The Lake could offer so much, if someone was at dock to control boaters. A lot of the big boats are not considerate of the smaller boats. Kind of like the freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpieT_12
40,Great lake in LA County!,"It's a blessing and a curse that Castaic Lake is situated a good 40-or-so-minute drive north of Los Angeles.It's a blessing because it's not as hyped as other places, so it's not ridiculously crowded (at least it hasn't been when I've visited).But the distance is also a curse because trips there must be planned.The lagoon is a nice place to kayak and paddleboard. In the summer/early fall the water is tolerable so it's not too painful to get acclimated to the wet temperatures. If you drive up to the lake, it's a fantastic place to barbecue, picnic, and just sit back and relax and take in the view. (And take photos!)I'll definitely be back to chill and someday camp!Note: Parking is $11 per standard vehicle, and it's cash only. There is sooooooooo much parking, so that shouldn't ever be a problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agnesc409
40,Big area to explore,"This is quite a large body of water with a number of little offshoot bays with some wildlife.Good kayaking area, but watch the faster boat traffic.Some slow entry lines with all sortsa paperwork BS for boats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9703TSwilliamd
