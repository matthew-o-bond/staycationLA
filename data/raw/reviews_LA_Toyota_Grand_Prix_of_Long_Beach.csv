40,Fun and worth going!,"First time we went to this Grand Prix in LB. Easy to get around and not difficult to get in and out. The only thing is they should have more elevator accessibility or signs on where to get it. The food and beverages were expensive but you could bring in your own without too much hassle, or there were restaurants nDefinitely worth the trip.",KkFiff
50,Good racing and nice time.,"We go every year to this Grand Prix. Nice to watch all the races and fair type food trucks with grills make for a nice time. Walked around the conventions center...lots of vendors selling all kinds of things and you see some of the race cars there too. Weather was perfect, which helps when sitting in the grand stands. Called "" Acura Grand Prix"" now.",CalifSue
50,My Bucket List Item,"This has always been a bucket list item for me. Fortunately my cousin lives in Long Beach and was able to get some tickets. We got the $147 3 day tickets with reserved seating for Saturday and Sunday with pit and garage access and seats viewing corners 9-11. I have to give Long Beach credit for orchestrating making a road course through the streets of the city that is challenging and fan accessible and took months to organize. There are plenty of activities both around the track and in the convention center and on the streets on Thursday. Food from the Food Truck/Trailers were a little on the pricey side as was beer, but there were some booths that were sponsored by first responders with hotdogs for ~$3 versus $16 at the commercial vendors. All in all, Great weather, Great People, and a Great weekend of racing with Super Trucks, IMSA Cars, Historic Cars, and of course the Indy Cars.",Jeff P
30,Slowly dying,If Acura is going to take over as the sponsor they are going to have come up with something to make it more exciting on Friday and Saturday?,Cassie F
50,Sky coaster,Chaz at the sky coaster was excellent! My brother was so scared but Chaz helped talk him through it! Bravo Chaz!,Brooke P
50,The Need for Speed! - April 2018,"What a great way to spend a weekend in southern California. Discounted tickets are usually available online but must be purchased in advance. Search the internet for deals. Depending on which day you attend, there are lots of free General Admission seats. Most seats are reserved on Sunday. There are numerous food outlets, restaurants, and gourmet food trucks. Beer, beer, beer! Lots of automotive exhibits too.They no longer have the Pro-Celebrity race. The IMSA race is now the main event on Sat. They added a drifting race on Saturday night which is really cool if you've never seen one. Both Fri & Sat night's have concert performers. Sunday is the Indy car finals. This year they had an F-35 Lightning overfly the main event opening on Sun...very cool!Lots of fun...and if you're just a ""people watcher""...you'll love this event. I've been attending for years and will continue going forward. Try it, you'll like it!",Kitman
50,Car Racing Nirvana!,"These races take place on the streets of Long Beach and Shoreline Drive. The event includes the cadre of IMSA Sports Cars (prototypes and GTLM), Indy Cars, Can-Am Cars (Camaros, Mustangs, AMX and Javelins, etc), and the High Performance Trucks. It is amazing watching these cars (and pickups) do such high speeds on the streets (150-190mph depending on the class). There is also a large Lifestyle Expo to visit with many manufactures and OEM producers represented. I was there on Friday for the practice and qualifying and you could walk around the track and view the racing from different areas. Bring good walking shoes, a jacket for the morning, sunglasses, earplugs, and sunblock. There are plenty of good food and beverage vendors at the event, so you can travel light.",asitis63
50,Definitely Worth Visiting,"This happens every April. Be prepared for the loud engines with earplugs. There are cars displayed inside the building, some of which are unique. Outside one can see cars going at high speeds on the track.A must for car fans.",Porcelina8
50,Family Fun!,"This is always a fun event for car racing fans! Car Expo, different racing events, meet the drivers .... and you're at the beach!",sierramountaingirls
50,Great weekend of racing and more,"This is one of the best weekend experiences in Southern California. Three days of fun. There is so much to do. There were five different types of races (IndyCars, Super Trucks, Vintage Can-Am, IMSA, and Pirelli world cup) Don't miss the Super Trucks! Autograph day on Friday was great. There is an expo with all sorts of exhibits. The whole atmosphere is great.",andrewwx
40,"""GRAND PRIX""","The cars were exciting to watch as some of them zoomed by at a speed of 200 miles a hour or less. This was a perfect day to watch different categories of cars race through the streets of downtown long beach. We enjoyed the life expos building which had different items to see. We enjoyed the Indy cars and the trucks jumping races. We moved closer to the fence to get a better view and browse the food truck areas and soak up some sun. The DJ played good music and Tecate was the drink of choice. Good day for racing, fun in the sun and relaxing.",GUCCI415
50,Where racing meets the sea,"This is always one of the weekends I look forward to each year. Incredible setting for a Indy race! Go to the Convention Center and check out the other exhibits. Try and purchase seats near the start/finish line. From there you can watch the pit stops, have large screen TVs to watch the racing on the other parts of the track.",Kevin B
50,A terrific event,The Long Beach GP has established itself as one of the highlights of Indy Car racing. But before it did it was a Formula 1 race. Greats such Niki Lauda and Mario Andretti raced spectacular races down Ocean Blvd then down the hill to what once was the site of the Long Beach Pike.The three days of racing is an incredible experience for the family and it is really reasonable for a one day or all weekend general admission pass.On Friday & Saturday during practices you can sit in several areas that are reserved on Sunday race day. Extra cost for paddock access. On Saturday you have the celebrity race that is always fun to watch and the Indy Lights. Sunday you have the multi class racing of IMSA where you get to see cars and teams that race the 22 hours of Sebring and Le Mans in June. But the star of the show is Indy Cars.Come with lots of sun screen. It is loud so ear plugs are a must. You can rent head sets to protect your ears. Try also rent radios to listen to announcers and team radios.Food at the race is not cheep and I don't think you can bring your own food in. Parking is a distance from tract so so to bring an ice chest and leave in your car can be an inconvenience. Download a Fan Guide from their website.,RoadBob
50,Awesome birthday,"We went to the Long Beach Grand Prix as a birthday party on Friday afternoon. A lot of auto racing a different event every hour, all qualifying or practice heats. Kids were free with a paid adult, under 12. Each practice heat lasted about an hour the right amount of time for a 10-year-old's attention. Plenty of places to wander and get stickers and autographs, and smell tons of gasoline. A 10-year-old's dream",Keith M
40,Grand Time,"The Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach is the biggest street race in America and the second-oldest street race in the world. It plays host to over 180,000 people come race weekend and to patronize Long Beach.",TGDino
