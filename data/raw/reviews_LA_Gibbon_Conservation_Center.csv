30,Gibons,Unexpected little place in Santa Clarita - you do get to see Gibons but a bit pricy but i understand they need to keep the place running and it’s not like a lot of people come byIf you are into Gibons this is the place for you,Vivian L
50,Wonderful view into the world of gibbons!,"Gibbon Conservation Center is a great place to visit on a weekend. Their hours are limited (Sat & Sun, 9:30 - noon). The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. When the gibbons begin ""singing""... oh my. I'm glad I knew what all the hooting was about before it began. There is cute metal vintage seating in shaded spots throughout. This is a hidden gem. You have to know it's there because signage is limited.",librarianlorraine
30,"Nice collection of Gibbons, but small property.",This is a great stop for high school and college kids who need lab class credit or have to do a paper. Little kids will definitely be entertained by the Gibbon monkeys when they howl in the AM.,Jerry Crawford
50,So Cute & Educational!,We took our Girl Scout troop to the Gibbon Conservation Center. Everyone loved it! Lots of pictures! Learned alot about the Gibbons and their care.,KimbaDDS
50,Up close education,The gibbons and their keepers are absolutely amazing. The apes are cute and smart and the keepers are very caring and informative. We loved our visit!,rybit
50,Couples Sunday Explorers,"This was a great experience for a group of Seniors. The Gibbons were singing ,Swinging and very entertaining . The docent filled us with all the information regarding their diet health, how they live in groups. Extremely knowledgeable and informative. It was a great day!",Juliana1027
50,"Gibbon Songs, Giggles, and Mischief Fun","The Gibbon Conservation Center was like walking into a concert when we arrived in the morning slightly before opening. I was caught up in all the beautiful sounds that I forgot to take video of the beautiful songs being sang sadly. As we walked around before the 10:00 tour, we were able to watch some continue their duets, as well as, watch others eat, swing, and play. During the tour some of the animals weren’t as visible but it was amazing to hear from the director of the center all about the species of gibbons they house at the center, the center’s care of the gibbons and the conservation impact the center has made. It was a delight to hear about the relationship dynamics of each gibbon group and learn about the future plans for the center. We were only there for about 2 hours but it was a fabulous morning spent. The best part of the day was watching some of the parents play with the little ones and being able to hear them laugh as they wrestled and tickled each other! Not much shade to enjoy during the tour, so highly recommend bringing a hat or even a sun umbrella.",Yeleny S
50,A True Wealth of Information,"This was our second visit to the facility, and my son was visiting to work on an Anthropology lab for the local college he attends. With a Groupon deal, I tagged along as his ""lab assistant."" Get there when it opens, because my only complaint is that currently it is only open from 9:30 am - noon on Saturdays and Sundays. They offer private tours for groups during weekdays. They have 5 different species of Gibbons (of 12 worldwide) at the center. There is a public tour, led by the center's Director, at 10:00, and we could tell immediately that she is very passionate about these animals and their well-being and conservation. The howling ""song"" they make is something to be experienced first-hand that gives a whole new perspective on ""surround sound."" For facilities, there aren't much (a port-a-john), but it is not as far as it looks from Santa Clarita. A little off the beaten path, but worth the drive off Bouquet Canyon.",travelguy537
50,Interesting tour!,"I had never heard of the Gibbon Conservation Center, until one day a few years ago, when I was at a vegetable stand that was on quiet Bouquet Canyon, and I heard the most unusual animal sounds in the distance. I was curious about them, and the woman at the counter said the sounds were gibbons from the conservation center. I looked it up online when I got home, and made a reservation. I paid full price, but found out afterward that Groupon had a half-price deal (not sure that is still the case though). My mom and I enjoyed the tour very much, and learned a lot about gibbons. The tour guide tried to get some of the gibbons to ""sing"" but they would not oblige...but apparently they ""sing"" fairly often. I recommend this tour for children and adults, but very young children might get bored. [Note - this form requires me to say when I visited. It was Springtime, way back in 2014, which is not an option on the form -- so I put in a random Spring month and year.]",scvfelicia
40,Interesting Visit,Looking for san attraction in the area to do. Found this very interesting. You can spend about 1 to 1-2 hours here. Interesting tour guide tells the story of the animals and their babies that have been raised here.. You can walk around and view the animals in their habitats.,mlove999
50,Very informative!,"Great place, informative staff and tour. Go early so you can hear them greet each other in the morning. Their ""howls"" are amazing!",Michelle F
30,Try to visit on cooler days,You'll get to understand why the conservation is so far off the community when you get out of your car. We were welcomed by a medley of whooping and screeching sound and it my 2yr old excited to see what the hullabaloo about.It has a charming rustic feel to it that I quite liked however we chose the wrong day to come. The heat that day was quite unbearable for all of us that we contemplated on sneaking inside the monkeys cages to get sprayed on by the mist. The monkeys were still quite energetic in spite of the weather we would've stayed longer if it weren't too hot outdoors.You'd be able to go around the compound in less than 15mins but it is a nice place where you can watch the monkeys swing and play.,casm
40,Leisure,Gibbons are not monkeys!The staff is friendly and full of information about the Gibbons. They accept donations to help with the finances of running the refuge for Gibbons,sibemania
10,Not much,If you want to spend 15 minutes of your time it's something to do---the drive to and from will take longer than visiting this place. It's not bad just not much,1kenny
50,Donations,Great place to visit and see how college students/ veterinarians help these Given monkeys prosper. It is just awesome,allana s
50,Absolutely fantastic and worth a visit.,"My family and I just got back from visiting the Gibbon Conservation and really enjoyed it. They are only open on weekends (9:30 am-12) with one paid tour at 10. The enclosure is relatively small and you will definitely NOT interact with the Gibbons but you will see them up close. I believe they're considered one of the ""best"" singing apes in the world and when they let loose it's pretty impressive. It costs around 12.00 per adult with discounts for children and seniors. This is so worth it as these apes are critically endangered and the 3 (ONLY 3) full-time staff are incredibly passionate about their work This pretty clearly isn't a job for them by the way, Very nice and dedicated people. One VERY useful tip: Arrive at 9:30 when they open. We were able to literally have the place to ourselves for 20 minutes or and watched the Gibbons being fed. So much fun.",Mark J
50,Extremely Educational,"This is the most amazing tour I have ever been on. The center is run solely by 3 very dedicated, knowledgeable women. It is a distance off the freeway, but well worth the drive. They are currently only open on the weekends, but will accommodate private tours, up to 12 people. Make sure to get there when they open, so that you won't miss the only guided, and very informative tour. After the tour you may go watch any of the gibbons swing and encourage them to ""sing"". Make sure to wear walking shoes and a hat. There are picnic tables if you wish to bring a picnic, but they do currently close at 12.",Ali K
50,Excellent Visit,"This small facility is quite interesting. The tour is optional and free, but well worth the price of admission. There is a lot to know about gibbons in general and, more specifically, the gibbons who live here. We really enjoyed the wild and loud ""singing"" of the gibbons, as well as watching them in their habitats. They are fed several times a day, so you will likely get to see them using both hands and feet to eat.Be aware that the last quarter mile of the approach to the facility is on a dirt road. It's hot and dry out here in the summer (and there is not a lot of shade), so it's smart to bring water.",Rosemary W
50,A great place to visit,The Gibbon conservation center is an excellent place to visit and take your family. If you can go for the breakfast with the Gibbons it is terrific....well worth your time and money.,Marci S
50,Wow!,"Even though it's small, it's so lovely. Our tour guide was sweet and very informative. My son loved the apes and at the end of tour the apes start to sing and it's amazing!!",Graice C
50,Not a Zoo,"This is not a Zoo , it is a place to study and conserve these Gibbons. They are well taken care of and it is great to see them in as close to a natural state as possible while still protecting them . I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who is not a fan of a typical Zoo environment. Take the Tour to complete your appreciation of the effort these dedicated people are taking in the preservation of the species.",Addison564
50,Interesting way to spend the morning,"I believe they are only open Saturday and Sunday from 9:30 am to noon. Tours are given at 10 am. Shortly after we began our tour, the gibbons began their call to mark their territory. The calls can be heard from two miles away and last from 25 to 45 minutes. The tour guide was forced to stop her talk. We thoroughly enjoyed what we did get to see and hear. Little pricey $15 adult, $10 senior, $5 kids",pkween
50,A Delightful Experience!,"We purchased a Groupon to visit this attraction, and were so delighted that we did. We weren't aware that this amazing experience was right in our own ""backyard"". We learned so much on the tour and have a new respect for this small ape. It was super interesting, they are fun to watch playing, eating, singing and interacting. This will be a wonderful experience to take family and friends visiting from out of town, as well. So happy that they are open weekends to the Public!",LadyDi_and_Cowman
50,Saving a Species,"The Gibbon Conservation Center is a very special place. Your visit there is more than just a fun way to spend some time and hopefully hear the gibbons singing their unbelievable song. Your support literally helps to save a species as gibbons are the most endangered primates in the world. The apes at GCC represent a world-class gathering of these rare, social, beautiful and critically endangered creatures. Come to learn, raise your awareness and be amazed.",OhKellyTravels
40,Apes in Santa Clarita!,"This is a wonderful, up-close opportunity to see these amazing apes. One man's vision has allowed us to see and understand Gibbons--a very interesting ape.",Mark D
40,Fun place to take the kids,Very interesting to learn about the gibbons. (They are not monkeys!) Fun to watch and very noisy when they are near feeding time. Great docents teach wonderful facts about the gibbon's life traits.,tym4zin
30,Fun!,"A bit pricey, but it cost$$ to maintain a few dozen primates. It's a fun experience, and somehow a bit quirky. Worth a visit.",Peter A
50,A wonderful way to learn about our ape family,"This is a great place to visit (for all ages) and a wonderful organization to support. They are open to the public on Saturday and Sunday, but we were lucky to be on a private tour (during the week) so we learned a lot about the gibbons, their habitat, their diet, family units, and unfortunately we learned how rare some species are. It is estimated that one of the species at the center has only 1,000 members left in the world!It is not a fancy center, but they do good work there. They hope to release one of the gibbons back into the wild within the next year. It was a real treat to hear them vocalize.",Pam M
50,Human-like primates with personality,A great way to spend a few hours learning about a very special primate. It is less overwhelming than a zoo because you focus on one type of animal.,Heidi-LA
50,GIMME GIBBONS,"The Gibbon Conservation Center may seem as if it is on the other side of the world but it is worth driving out to. Be sure to wear closed toe shoes as you walk only on dirt, twigs and small pebbles at times and be prepared to step into a shoe wash container before being allowed inside the area proper. This is to get off anything that could possibly affect the animals and makes sense. If you go early you will get to hear the screams of the different Gibbons as they have their own particular sounds. One group will set off the others and for a few moments, you are transported into the jungles in another country.I took 3 groups of children and teens to their ""Breakfast with the Gibbons"" and that included a buffet line of quick easy food for kids and adults alike. Cereals, milk, fresh fruit and bread and some sweets was eaten at the tables and benches set up that day.We all walked around on our own and sometimes were lucky to listen to the person explaining things to those on the tours. It is all outside and would suggest not going in the high heat of summer unless you go very early in the day or when they open. It is a great experience for old and young alike.",385eileenz
50,Learn about the Gibbon Conservation Center on a private tour.,"Gibbons are losing ground world wide and this Conservation Center is working hard to protect and return certain gibbons back to the wild. The gibbons at the center have come from all over the world. The tour is a very informative and entertaining experience. When the gibbons decide it is time to ""sing"" it gets really loud and fun to watch. A wonderful place to visit for young and old alike.",Charlene209
50,Heartwarming rescues,"A weekend visit gave us a wonderful impromptu ""show"" from all the residents. A tour was provided with details that helped us get to know the residents. Quite a respectable non-profit.",DaveB91351
50,So many kinds of gibbons!,"Small conservation operation, open to the public on weekends or as noted on the website. The staff are very devoted, the enclosures are clean, spacious and well kept. I was not aware there were so many distinct species of Gibbons. The tour is informative, the guides, keepers are knowledgeable, open to all questions and are the best asset to the fundraising efforts. It is well worth the visit. We have lived in Santa Clarita many years and have only recently made the time to get to know our primate neighbors. They are loud, but the vocalizations serve to keep groups together, and are limited unless there is a perceived threat or visitors want to start it by mimic hoots. The keepers, who live at the compound, have funny stories of being awakened at night, sometimes by an alert over something as small as a mouse. These are smart animals though, and though they are rarely on the ground, they call alerts for rattlesnakes and any other invaders.Do make time to go. It is worth the price.",Leslie H
50,An Amazing Animal Experience!,"First off, the Gibbon Conservation Center was not difficult to locate on any map application. My girlfriend, her sister, my son (10), my nephew (8) and myself arrived around 9:45 am which was just in time to get signed in. A very competent and knowledgable guide took our group on a tour around the conservation center, where we learned a great deal about each of the 40 gibbons that make this place home. I found the most captivating part of the tour was when the gibbons began their territory calls. The entire area was filled by a symphony of whooping, yelling, singing, and calling. It began with one couple and then spread from enclosure to enclosure until all were calling out their songs. Couples sang duets, single gibbons called out their availability, and families even called together. I have never experienced such an awesome display before my visit.If you have an interest in primates or animals in general I highly recommend a visit to the Gibbon Conservation Center. I found it easy to locate, not terribly expensive and the experience to be well worth the journey. I'm sure we will be returning for another visit in the future. Even the children had a great time, especially once the calling began!Just some consideration to think about when preparing to go.- it opens at 9:30am and closes at 12pm- the tour begins at 10am and finishes up around 11am- the weather begins to get very hot quickly between 10:30am to 12pm- bring sunblock and water as it is the desert and you can dry up quickly- definitely check out the website for info regarding visiting as there are a few important things on it to consider.-Vaccinations are important and if you are sick they ask you not visit until you are recovered. (This is because the gibbons can get sick with many human illnesses and have lower immune systems, so something that gives us the sniffles can kill a gibbon)",Arthur F
40,Awesome Sanctuary,"Great place to visit to see some wildlife that doesn't consist of horses, goats, or chickens which are all so common and typical of Santa Clarita. Great for learning, too",Kristen F
50,A fun way to spend a morning,"We were looking for something different to do and kind of stumbled across this place. Prior to our visit, what I knew about gibbons would fit in a thimble. I'd heard of them and knew that they were some sort of monkey but had no idea they were such complex and unique animals. I can't say enough about this place...we were all blown away.We arrived a few minutes after they opened and were greeted by two very nice volunteers. We paid the entry fee (which is very reasonable!) and kind of wandered around looking at a few of the enclosures.At 10:00 we took the tour with one of the paid staffers and it was a great idea. The tour guide gave us great insight and explained the differences between the various gibbon species and families. It's a relatively small place so the tour took less than an hour. At the end of the tour, our guide had all of the gibbons singing and howling. The sounds that these magnificent little guys make is incredible...makes you feel like you're in some sort of tropical rain forest.All in all we had a fantastic time here and will no doubt be back soon.",Mike P
50,Hidden Wonder,I've lived in the area my whole life and just recently discovered the gibbon conservation center. It's a wonderful little place with a great cause. All of the staff were super friendly and informative. I'd be happy just stopping by for a little bit to sit on a bench and enjoy watching the gibbons play.,catomd
50,Amazing,"I really can't say enough good things about this place. The guides are funny and knowledgable. It's not a zoo, it's a sanctuary and this is the only place in the world where you can see and hear 5 species of gibbons. Get there early to see them being fed and to hear their songs. I took my grandparents and we all loved it. I also send my students there for extra credit and each one has raved about it. It's a great way to learn about these apes.",alli_sun_t
40,Gibbon Conservation Center,very interesting led walks or go on your own. You can spend 30 minutes to an hour and some stay for hours observing the singing monkeys.,Lv2T
50,The Jungle in our own backyard,"The Gibbon Conservation Center came to our attention when we were out riding our bicycles on Bouquet Canyon. We all stopped when we heard the most amazing noise - was it sirens? was it dogs? it can't be.....wow it is... Monkeys!! The singing that these guys do is amazing. They have regular visiting times and special fund raising events a couple of times a year. They do a family day with face painting for the kids, veggie brunch and tours of the facility and all the gibbons. We have never been disappointed when we have visited. You can sit for hours and just watch them.",Dawn D
40,Worth the time,The Gibbon center is a small but well run conservation center and a great place to take kids to learn more about this fascinating animal.,larrywatsonl
40,A nice family outing and learning experience,I took my children here for the first time after living in the area for over 20 years. It was a great learning experience and the kids loved all of the howling Gibbons,Traveling_Man_1638
50,Off the beaten path,"Most people have never heard of the Gibbon Conservation Center but if you are tired of taking the kids to the zoo try this place. Gibbons are wonderful to watch. If you don't know what they are, they are small apes that move through the trees with their long arms. It's open to the public on Saturday & Sunday 9:30 to noon. They will also book private tours & parties. Admission is from $5 to $15 and well worth it. Easy to get to with directions. I've been there numerous times with different friends. Remember it is a research center so you won't find anything fancy about it but you can get pretty close to the animals.",pat q
50,What an unexpected treat!!,"We have lived in Santa Clarita for 20 years and never visited the Gibbon Center until my son and daughter took me and my husband there for my birthday last May. It is in a quite isolated place but easy to find using the directions online. The guide for our tour was extremely knowledgeable and got these little apes to ""sing"" by playing back their singing on her laptop! What a concert. The gibbons seemed well taken care of even though they were in cages. They have been rescued so a great deal of effort is being made to fundraise to support them well. Most come from SE Asia where we will be visiting next November so I was very glad to learn more about these special animals before our trip.",Joan J
50,nifty unknown gem,"Didn't even know it existed, until I saw a discount deal. The folks here (mostly volunteers) work hard to keep these animals healthy and happy. Get there early, to hear all the crazy noises! Location is a bit remote, as it should be. For sure worth a visit.",mavenbay
50,Great conservation center,"The Gibbon Conservation Center is a great place to learn about gibbons and see them up close. They sing, very loudly and it was nice to see them grouped together in family groups. There are several different species and it is nice to hear that they are helping with captive breeding and possible reintroduction to the wild for some of the most endangered species.They are looking to expand and be able to house more animals in larger enclosures soon but they are making due with what they have now as a non-profit.",EMK55
50,Great Learning Experience for Adults and Children,It's hard to believe this place exists in SCV. If you haven't experienced going it's worth your time. Help support this center. What a great cause and dedicated people. A wonderful experience for children of all ages.,WMSCV
40,Gibbons abound and hop and fly; a sanctuary for 'families',"These are such cute primates... they are amusing, darling, and interesting. They 'sing' loudly in a simulataneous outbreak of barking, melodic chanting or maybe just loud Gibbons conversations about the humans visiting them. Some of these small Asian primates are endangered at this point. Many of the Gibbons there were grouped in enormous cages as a family. They are active and practically fly across the tops of branches. One stuck his hand out and around the padlock and jiggled and worked it like he was going to break out. It is a small property nestled in the mountains, so it takes a good while to drive out there and you can spend only an hr or so. You can go a scenic route one direction and the highway the other if you have the time. The scenic route is a wild, winding mountain road with incredible views. Bring water with you - no food sold. Great family half day trek but only open to the public on Sat. mornings.",lsihrofhhisc
50,A Must Stopover on a Saturday Morning,"This conservation center is a hop, skip, and a jump away from Magic Mountain. If you're in the area, or on your way to Magic Mountain, stop by and make a difference. The conservation center is open on Saturdays from 9:30 to noon. You can learn a lot about these endangered apes. The tour is super informative, and the staff is there to answer any questions you might have about the gibbons. The gibbons live in pretty spacious digs, and you'll see them swinging through their habitat. Learn about their familial units, and which gibbons are trying ""dating"" to be potential mates. The gibbons are active in the day, so you'll get to see them in action, and not just sleeping. If you're lucky, you might see a baby or two! The road to the conservation center is gravel, but you don't need a 4 wheel drive. Bring a hat and sunscreen, as you'll be in the sun walking around from habitat to habitat. Comfortable shoes are recommended; you'll be walking on dirt. Closed toe would be good as you need to step in a shallow pool of disinfectant before entering the center so the gibbons don't contract anything from us visiting! Restroom is a porta-potty. The center is very clean, and habitats doesn't smell like poo!",Noodle W
50,Incredible place!,"I just went to the Gibbon Conservation Center as an Assistant Caregiver for a Day, and I can't even describe how incredible it was. I fed the gibbons multiple times throughout the day, and being able to hand some of the gibbons food or have them take blueberries out of my hand was my favorite part. It was such a pleasure to learn about gibbons as a whole and each gibbon individually. The Gibbon Conservation Center does a lot with very little, and I was very impressed with their operation. I loved it, and I highly recommend it for animal lovers everywhere.",Cassie D
40,Wonderful,This is a nice little place to see some fun gibbons. They're extremely expressive and active. I could watch them all day.,IronMerMayden
40,Getting Closer to Nature and Learning at the Same Time,Spend an afternoon getting closer to nature and learning about the Gibbons! The GCC offers the visitor all the information you could expect to find about the Gibbons. There are many different varieties there and the kids will love the cute little guys.,Traveling_Man_1638
50,Amazing,"I stumbled upon this little gem a while back. It is hidden from view on a gravel road. Once inside it transports you to another place. A magical place free of stress, worries, and politics that seem to pop up everywhere. Admission is $10/adult and children under five are free. The staff and volunteers are caring and informative. They all have a sparkle in their eyes when talking about their apes. The gibbon song is nothing short of amazing. Bring your camera and capture some of the gibbons playing and singing. It is well worth the trip. The gift shop has gibbon dolls which are more realistic then stuffed animals normally are (no oversized eyes here).",Sminkus
50,"Great cause, great visit.",Be sure to go at 10 am so that you can catch the docent led tour. You will have a much greater appreciation for the Center's work and for the personalities of the gibbons. Such a great place to visit.,HappyHiker20
50,Educational and fun,Went here for a Mother's day trip and loved it. I generally love watching monkeys and other primates at zoos but here was a place right in my area where I could do it. There is a cost to get in but the money goes towards the cost of running the center so I didn't mind. The guides were all knowledgeable and friendly and there are places to sit and rest if you get tired.,bootsysmom
50,Unique Insights,A one of a kind place to learn about the smallest member of the ape family as they live in family units. Friendly and knowledgable folks with a passion for their work.,Peter B
50,So much fun,"I did not have high hopes for this place from what others have told me -- boy I could not have been more wrong! The place is small and it really is a conservation center and not a zoo. You stand 10 feet from the Gibbons behind a little barrier. The Gibbons are right there in your face screaming and swinging and eating and all. There are young ones and old ones, hyper and calm ones. It was great! The kids (1 and 3 yr old) both loved it and did not want to leave (just had to watch them closely to make sure they did not go up to the Gibbons cages or they could get seriously hurt). We are going back for sure!",unathan1
50,Unique Experience,"I took my family here recently on a Sunday morning. What a unique and wonderful experience! I have four children, from 13 down to 6. We all enjoyed this place.First off, make sure you get there for the 10:00 am tour - which is included with your admission. The tour makes the whole thing worth it. The guide knows all the animals intimately and shares info on how the gibbons got to the center and their personalities, etc. There is a self guided tour if you miss that one, but with very little info compared to the tour.It took us less than an hour to have the tour and then look around on our own. The gibbons sang while we were there and it was awesome. Gave me chills. Several of the enclosures had babies too, which were really fun to see.The place has a rustic feel and you can tell the focus is on caring for the gibbons - not on you. There are lots of places to sit and observe the enclosures - even picnic tables in the shade (if you bring your own food).This is a great place to visit - but it won't be a long outing.",Tasiadoo
50,Heart-Warming Watching the Gibbons Play! Highly Recommended.,"If you love animals, you must go to the Gibbons Conservation Center! This is the rarest group of apes in the Western Hemisphere. They are open Saturday and Sunday mornings 9:30a-12:00n for self-guided tours as well as an expert led tour at 10:00a. Admission is only $10.The Gibbons totally put on a fabulous ""show"" swinging, playing and singing!As in the wild, most Gibbons live here in family units - with Mom, Dad and kids. It was lots of fun watching the animals interact with each other - with behaviors that seem to parallel that of human families. It was also very interesting to see how they introduce male and female Gibbons to each other - in hopes of making a match!Throughout the center is really cool, old metal patio furniture in front the enclosures. We really enjoyed just sitting on this retro furniture and watching the Gibbons play!The Center takes excellent care of these glorious animals. Gabriella, the head keeper, is very knowledgeable. It was very interesting to listen to her talk about Gibbons in general and the individual animals at their center.Please be advised you'll be asked to dip the soles of your shoes in a disinfectant (to protect the animals) and that the toilet is a porta-potty.",SunshineGirl2929
