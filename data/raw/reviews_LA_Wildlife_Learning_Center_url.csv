40,"Lions, Tigers and Bears...Oh My!","On Saturday a group of us city folk from the West Side of Los Angeles traded our designer duds for jeans, backpacks and comfortable shoes. Well, most of us did. I was wearing my most comfortable Tori’s and carrying a mini Prada and everyone else wore the appropriate attire for walking through a jungle-like atmosphere to see wild rescue animals. It turns out whatever anyone was wearing, it was an incredible tour. Our tour started with feeding shredded carrots to the llamas and the alpacas. They are so cute! But be careful, they spit! Next we encountered ducks, swans, roosters, and a large turkey. Not too scary — yet. As our hike commenced, we encountered baboons, lions, hyenas, cute little monkeys and an amazing black cougar with the most beautiful green eyes. We also found out that the baboons knew how to spit pretty well, too. Some of us got the tail-end of one of their well-honed techniques. A little landed on my Tory’s. Eew. The coolest part of the tour was the super large tigers. Beautiful creatures, at the same time quite intimidating. Where did all these animals come from? They were all rescues from everywhere. Private owners, Hollywood movie sets, research labs, illegal exports. Thank god there is a place for these beautiful animals. This is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarabV7441KC
50,Fun Activity for the family,"We are down from Alaska visiting family in Valencia, and took our granddaughters on what started out as a rainy Saturday afternoon, but the sun came out when we arrived at the Learning Center. It's like a small zoo with individual stories about many of the animals there, all who have been rescued. The staff are super friendly. Though the ""Zoo"" is small, it is just right for a 4 and 7 year old, as well as for the grandparents. There were 2 reptile presentations, an hour apart, which were very well done. Reptiles are NOT my favorite, but the 2 they brought out were amazing and very interesting: a Skink, Barrett, and an Eastern Indigo snake, named Ocyrus. We all had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akerdoc
50,Lovely,"We were lucky enough to come before feeding time and stay for feeding time and see their behavioural changes.The park is small but has an adequate amount of animals and the lovely, knowledgeable people here have helped nurture the animals back to good health and offer knowledge and conservation tips to the public.Unfortunately many of the animals cannot return back to the wildlife for several reasons, you can Google their website 'wildlife learning centre' and read each animals story.The admission fee is very reasonable and under 2s are free. For anyone that says this place should be free how do you expect the animals to be fed and their vet bills to be paid?There are portapottys which were surprisingly clean, hand washing, benches to sit and eat and parking available too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shenizm
40,Small and their add ons for closer encounters were really expensive,"We had extra time to kill before checking in to our hotel and I found a discount on LivingSocial so we gave it a try. Small parking lot, but it's free parking and you could also park on the street. We saw everything in about an hour. The stories of the animals posted outside their cages are very informative and some are quite sad. Some of the animals really liked to interact through the fence. We contemplated doing an added encounter to feed some animals, but the price was over $100 so we just bought some stuffed animals and left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726stacyt
40,Cute baby Zoo,"This small center took us about 45 minutes to walk through and read the stories (some very sad) on the animals being housed there. If you walk quickly through without looking at any animals, you could finish the center in 5 minutes! It's that small! But I don't regret visiting, it is an amazing tiny experience.All the animals are one you could only find at zoos and you are fairly close to them when viewing.Cleo was my favorite, he has such a sad story but when you first see him he puts a smile on your face and you get a good laugh. Also, the owl at the front entrance, he is so cute!!We did not go into the reptile house because it is against our religion, but my husband went in and said the first thing you see is a huge piton. Nope, not this time Satan!When you visit please read all the stories :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AleshaAmber
40,Small but a great experience,"I saw a deal for this place on Living Social and thought ""why not"". I had a great time and got some fantastic pictures. Parking is limited, but if their lot is full street parking is available. There are a variety of animals like lemurs, bald eagles, foxes, sloths, etc. It was great to see them up close. This is definitely a great place for kids because you can watch them feed the animals and touch some of the reptiles at various times throughout the day. What I liked best about this place was their commitment to discussing the dangers of having an exotic animal and their commitment to conservation. It's a great learning experience, especially if you don't like zoos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alli_sun_t
50,"Great for children, and children-at-heart","What a great experience! Ideal place for children and children-at-heart. It's a small, shaded area on the edge of a residential area. There is limited parking inside the fence. I recommend parking on the street. Prices have gone up a little, but the most that you'll pay per person is $10 for an adult. Students, seniors, and I think military are $8. The great thing about this place, is that you can get up close to the enclosures, and look the porcupines in the eye. Same with the monkeys, foxes, tortoises, and the other animals. Even in the heat of the day, you can see the lynx and bobcat sleeping, whereas at the LA Zoo, the animals would be hidden in their caves. For the most part, these animals are so cute! No lions or tigers, but more alligators than the Zoo. Two bald eagles live here, and they would have died in the wild. In fact, most of these animals would have died. Most are rescued animals that were either abandoned by their mothers, or illegally imported as exotic pets that got to be too much for their owner to handle. The staff are enthusiastic about what they are doing, and very helpful. The trainer talks feature various animals, brought out of their enclosure, to meet you up close and personal. In fact, for a reasonable fee, small groups can get trainer-accompanied access inside the animal enclosure. Pet a sloth? Yes, you can! There is a giraffe and a couple of zebras, but their area won't be finished until about mid-October 2017, so you can only see them from a distance at this time. Restrooms are a couple of porta-potties, but nice ones, and kept clean. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223
50,Even Better than I expected,"My husband surprised me with a trip to WLC because of my sloth obsession. We got there fifteen minutes prior to opening on a Saturday because the sloth experience does not take reservations. We were the second people there. We parked right along the centers fence for free. When they opened the gate promptly at 10:00, I noticed they had a small parking lot. They do take credit cards and with military veterans discount the cost for entry and sloth experience was $116 (sloth interaction was $100). We were very surprised how active almost all our the animals were. The porcupines were hilarious, we never knew they could crawls upside down on the underside of their roof enclosure.Every single employee we interacted with was very friendly and knowledgeable. Our guide in the sloth enclosure was very passionate and I learned so much about my favorite furry friends without feeling I was in school or preached at. Lola and Syd were the absolute best and I was so excited that they were SO active (11:00am). My husband and I spent 2hrs 15minutes, but we are huge animal lovers and loved watching each of the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailor_grl
50,Amazing chance to view and help rescue animal and birds,This was the most amazing little unknown treasure. It is a small animal rescue centre that depends solely on us all visiting. We had an encounter with the famous Lola the sloth and her room mate Syd. If you ever want to get up close and personal with a sloth this is the place to go and at the same time helping out for the care of these animals. Most animals there have been seized from illegal pet owners. It is only a small park so not a lot of time is needed. It can be hard to find as it is in suburbia surrounded by big houses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendoveravenue
50,A Hidden LA Gem For Anyone With Children (or without)!,"My wife an I are animal lovers and discovered The Wildlife Learning Center before we had our son. This place is like a very small zoo that has rescued animals. It is very inexpensive to get in, but one unique things is that you can purchase animal encounters. We got to get up-close and personal with a sloth and several porcupines, who stole the show! They do a free trainer talk on the hour every hour where they bring out a different animal to talk about and give the opportunity to touch them. In the reptile house, you'll see some of the biggest snakes you've ever seen!Years later, now having a young child... this is the perfect place to visit. We have a membership (only $40 for the YEAR if your child is under 3) and go nearly every week. The great thing about this place is that it doesn't take long to do. As parents, you try to get your kids out everyday, but sometimes here in LA, it's really hot and you can't commit to a big day at The LA Zoo or even the park where they'll want to go for a long time... So when it's too hot to go outside, you can come here and even though it'll be hot, you'll only be there for a half an hour or so... So it's really nice to have a place like this to go.The staff is very friendly and since we go so often, we feel like family. More parents should know about this. Very fun!PS... Parking is street parking as this is in a residential neighborhood, but I have NEVER had a problem parking right outside their doors and I go almost once a week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
20,Depressing,"It seemed nice at first to get up close to the animals, and then you realized how poor their living conditions are. The cages are very small and there seems to be almost nothing for the animals to do. There was very loud construction with heavy equipment going on behind some of the animals cages. This this continual noise had to be very stressful for them. I got a deal on Groupon for 2 tickets for $8 total. Considering we spent less than 20 minutes there, it certainly is not worth the $10 per person admission price we would have paid with the coupon. Save your money, and donate it to a worthy wildlife conservation organization instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex
50,Great experience,"This is a great experience for anyone who loves animals and wants an opportunity for some 'close encounters'. My husband and I booked a private interactive tour. Yes, it's a little pricey but the money helps support the animals AND you get to interact with some of them. Note: You can still visit even if you don't want to pay for the interactive tour or animal encounters. The entrance fee is very reasonable.Our tour guide was a biologist - very knowledgeable. We were able to feed the porcupines, touch sloths, hold an owl, and enjoy a few other encounters. Great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianew166
40,"Small, But Very Interesting","In a residential area of Sylmar is this small gem. You could walk the place in less than an hour, but you will take longer to see all of these wonderful animals. The walkways give you a pretty up close view of everything. All of the animals (including birds and reptiles) are very interesting. The staff will come out and give you some great information and might even have an animal to touch. FYI, the bathrooms are porta-potties. Also, a little muddy after it rains. The pathways are not paved, so be careful with strollers. At the end you can adopt a pet rock for free. How cool for the kiddies! Very nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryD813
40,Small but intimate,It's a very small place so don't plan on spending the whole day there. If you really enjoy watching animals and want to take your time with each one it's a great place. The staff were very approachable and engaged the visitors. They went around to each of the animals and gave them special enrichment toys/foods while we were there. I would love to go back for one of their animal specific events like feeding the porcupine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catomd
50,Worth the detour!,"We visited the Wildlife learning center as part of our Californian road trip in July 2016 and it was truly worth the detour! My mum, teenage son and myself enjoyed a couple of hours with the animals and paid the extra to get up close and personal with the sloths, Lola and Sid, and the armadillo, Tatu. The staff we met were friendly and informative and we look forward to hearing of their property developments planned for the animal enclosures and hopefully one day revisiting them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joyu73
30,Surprise sloth experience.,"M husband surprised me on honeymoon with a sloth experience. The experience itself was great, the keeper was very informative about the sloth-Sid.The rest of learning centre was quite small and didn't take long to walk around. I would say being from the UK I found the cages quite small for some of the animals compared to what we are used to in the UK. There were a lot of school groups there learning about the animals which was good to see the education element as the staff knew their stuff.We were a little disappionted as zeus the starry eyed owl was away somewhere else on the day we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsu448
30,Family wildlife trip,"The admission is $8.00. There is not much to see, honestly it's not worth spending money for the admission. There is a picnic area where you're able to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadineo341
40,A nice cute small zoo with small to mid sized animals.,"This is a small zoo, well presented and fairly accessible. We enjoyed it. With small children, this will be a hit. With older kids, they probably won't like it as much. It was cute and fun for little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulMc_Marinaca
40,delightful,"a lovely learning centre where animals are ""rescued"" and looked after. We had a lovely time exploring the centre and looking at the variety of animals. We also enjoyed talking to other visitors - some who were going to have an interactive experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5inatent
50,Great little wildlife center,"We spent a few hours visiting the Wildlife Learning Center. It is small, but informative. The staff were outstanding. We did two individual visits (that you pay extra for) with Sid the sloth and a fennec fox. Every hour near the front (under Merlin's area), a staff member brings out an animal and discusses it. We got to meet a milksnake. We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romad79
50,Amazing place,"Those animals had been injured by bad owners, but this Center Helped them and gave them a place to live in peace.You can learn a lot there, it's a good experience for children too. Go see by yourself this amazing place....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MymyRose
40,Good little place,"The animals were in small enclosures, true, but most (if not all) were animals that had been injured in the wild and were rescues. Was a small place that took a short time to visit. You have to park on the street, this obviously was originally someone's property that just ended up expanding into this. We definitely want to go back and do an encounter for a special occasion perhaps. This was a spur-of-the-moment trip and it was a nice little place that is doing its best! And their neighbors behind them have a giraffe and ostriches that you can see a little bit, which is rather cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahP898
10,"If you want to see Animals sleep all day, heres the place to go!","When arriving, there was a small gate opening to go into. Walking into the office, the employees did not greet me or the other person who was with me. Finally, after being acknowledged, I paid for my ticket and was on my way. I was constantly hitting flies off of me while walking around. Most animals were sleeping, and because of my love for animals I knew most of them were active throughout the day. I saw an alligator that was in a tiny cage, and on the facts about it, it talked about the places it likes to live; swamps and other wet environments. The alligator was in a cage where it could barely even move around and had NO water in its cage at all. Another animal I saw was the tortoises, and of course these animals require mud to cool off with. The cage was dry and their water bowl was almost empty knowing that their is more than five animals in there who drink water. In one cage with a bird, their were feather stuck on the cage and a poor animal hitting the cage because it had no room to fly. It came to my attention that these animals do not seem to have proper care. Lastly, in the reptile room, I saw an amazing long snake, after observing it for about 10 minutes, i saw no movement. When asking the employees, they told me that these animals are not active, which is completely false.Overall, if you want to see animals suffer and sleep all day, this is the place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlinwallace
50,Amazing,"We did the safari tour. It was amazing. We got to feed porcupines, hold an owl, see and pet a sloth, etc. Great experience!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexam10
40,Nice small place to encounter animals,"I took my kids to visit this place, we expect animal encounter and we did! It's a very small place if you walk around you'll finish in 15 minutes. They offer animal encounter with added fee, they also have Sloth, the most expensive to greet/meet at $100. Their staff will let you into their cage and brief you about the animal and let you feed them. It's a memorable experience for the kids, and you won't be able to do this at the zoo.Please note that they only offer portable toilet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pomme2222
50,A must for animal lovers!,"After seeing Lola the Sloth on an episode of Ellen years ago, I had been following the Wildlife Learning Centre on Instagram obsessively. When my husband advised me he wanted to spend our honeymoon in California, I thought I would try and combine a visit to the Wildlife Learning Centre and it turned out to be one of the most wonderful experiences of our entire trip.I booked the VIP experience from the UK via email and by telephone (to pay the deposit) and was welcomed with open arms when we arrived there for our tour at 3.30pm. Parking is outside on the street (we parked beside the fence) and the centre is situated in a suburban neighbourhood.Leah showed us around and took us the meet the Servals, Fennec foxes, Porcupines (my favourite), Owls and many more. We got to feed Sid the sloth and the porcupines. We got to stroke Buster the Fennec fox and learn about why some of these animals are not great for pets as a lot of the animals they get in are abandoned as pets.I think if you came to this place just to view as a zoo, you would not be getting full experience and that having a behind the scenes tour will give you the full benefit of visiting. The rates are very reasonable and you will be funding what is a great organisation.Top tip: Look out for the famous Zeus the owl in the reception office. He often hangs out in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MishImpossible
40,Great little zoo!,"The Wildlife Learning Center in Sylmar is a fun way to spend an hour or 2. It's pretty small, but well worth the $7 admission. Animals look to be well cared for, and are much more visible and close up than at larger zoos.We saw monkeys, turtles, eagles, porcupines (super adorable), a sloth, serval and other cats, and little foxes. A few other animals as well. Most were pretty active, so it was more entertaining than just watching an animal sleep in a far away corner.There's a giraffe and some ostriches at the ranch behind the center... not affiliated but you can still view them behind the resident animals.We didn't opt to pay extra for the personal interaction with the animals, but learned a lot from watching others do so.Definitely worth a visit if you don't have to commute too far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biscotti0928
30,"As a nature conservationist, this was not for me! Nice wildlife though","Ok, now I always try to give the credit where credit is do. The concept of this wildlife waystation was all there, however, the poor animals live in such small confined spaces. I could not really enjoy myself. I kept asking my friend who invited me why they would gift me for my birthday with such a sad view.I was in disbelieve and had to ask the office staff how long the animals spend in these cages... she responded by telling me all day everyday. I quickly escorted myself out of this place.The intention to provide shelter for the animals is there, however, this facility needs to be triple the size it is now.This type of place is cool for people who like zoos and circuses I guess. Not for me sorry. Keep up the good work that you do provide.It's a very small waystation. You should be able to roam around the whole place in under an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FannyMartinez
50,Rescued Animals treat you well!,"I love the Wildlife Learning Center. You actually learn a lot through out their different animal shows through out the day. I strongly recommend one of their private animal tours. A little pricey but you are helping a good cause. All these animals have been rescued and given a second chance. The place is small, you can do it all in one hour if you want. But take your time. And don't forget to peek at the giraffe, it's not part of their zoo but it's adjacent to them. Just peek from the entrance to the right, there are tables and chairs there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank
50,Great tiny zoo!,Such a great small zoo. Perfect for kids or elderly who can't walk long. Large variety of animals and species and knowledgeable and friendly staff! You can have birthday parties there too as well as animal interactions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifersA1575DQ
30,Reptile's Sanctuary,"Hubby bought discounted tickets for this place. (Good thing!). Came here during summer break on a Friday afternoon. It was hot so the visit was quick for us. We were a bit disappointed because most of the animals were resting. They have a small airconditioned room with different reptiles. (Cool!). They only had one show and tell activity and that was it for the most part. No one to talk to or guide us outside.We were there less than an hour... And Zeus, the blind owl was inside shop/office, also asleep. The person inside the office seemed to be too busy... oh well... maybe it was not a good day to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
40,Definitely a treat for the kids,"I purchased my tickets from Groupon which cut the cost in half for my family. The kids seemed to enjoy looking at all the animals that were there and there seemed to be very knowledgeable staff working to answer any questions we had. What I liked most about this place was that it was not overwhelming in size. Too many times we had gone to the zoo and would hear complaints about being tired and the walking and such. Here, we had zero complaints. Kids could take in some exotic animals, learn something about them, and quickly move on to the next. Overall, great experience for us all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,See a Sloth Actually Move,"Small, clean, well-maintained facility with a diverse group of animals. Animals are obviously healthy and active (event the sloth was moving). You are very close to the cages and the staff is very attentive and helpful. Only need 60-90 minutes to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104jamesg
50,Up Close With Animals,"Wildlife Learning Center keeps a small collection of animals that can not be returned to to the wild and are used for education with the public. The entire place takes less than an hour to tour, however, there are ""experiences"" you can purchase to meet some of the residents animals up close. These include feeding porcupines, petting a fennic fox or armadillos, among other experiences. There seems to be coupons available fairly regularly on many sites.Overall it is a fun event to take the family. Bring a camera for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TybaltPrinceOfCats
50,See the animals up close.,"Admission was $7/adult, $6/child, though we had a Groupon for this visit which saved us a couple of bucks. We really enjoyed the experience and were amazed at how close we were to the animals. Yes, most are separated from the walkway by a fence, but the animals are very comfortable with people and will roam/play/sleep right up against the fence which is often little more than an arm's length away. They don't seem bored or stressed, and some even seem like they like the attention.We were done in about 90 minutes and the whole place is rather charming. It's mostly a self-guided tour with trainer shows every hour where you can learn more about an animal up close and touch it. I think it's great for younger kids, but there's something for everyone if you just stop and look.WLC's size minimizes the time commitment (and the price reflects that), but they have picnic tables and seating areas if you want to spend a bit more time. They also have a variety of ""close encounters"" for small groups, with an additional fee. I'm sure their website lists them in detail.Since we're close enough, we'll probably come back every few months. The way I see it, I could easily spend two to three times the money going out to the movies. This is by far more interesting and interactive...and just better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USC_Mare
40,Mini safari,"I would have gave it 5 stars if they had more animals. It's a small place that can be seen within an hour. They give an animal show every hour on the hour. It's only $7 for adults, $6 for children and seniors.I went with 4 family members and we all enjoyed it. I'd definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eleanorg389
30,Quaint but Cute,"Bought a 2 for 1 Groupon. After making the drive to Sylmar from Los Angeles, you'll have spent more time in the car than at the Center. It's a very small facility, but you do get to see some animals much closer than you would at a zoo. Porcupines were my favorite, too cute. It sort of seems like a ""home made"" zoo however i believe the animals there are all being rehabilitated or were rescued. It's a sweet place and if you are in the area an easy low cost outing.Free street parking was plentiful on a Sunday afternoon and we got to adopt a pet rock :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenandallthethings
50,Excellent Zoofari tour,"My friend and I booked a private Zoofari tour, which lasts 1.5 hours. The center itself is small, but it is great. Before our tour, we went to a trainer talk, which was informative. The tour is highly interactive - we got close to and interacted with a serval, porcupine, owl, rainbow boa, sloth, armadillo, alligator, fennec fox, sugar gliders...the list goes on. We learned so much about all of the animals at the center and our guide was great about photo opportunities. We also learned about where the animals came from and how they ended up at the center...many of them were rescued from the illegal animal/pet trade or irresponsible owners. The center does a great job caring for these animals and giving them another chance, so I think it is a great organization as well. I highly recommend the zoofari tour! There are also individual animal encounters, if you prefer to interact with one kind of animal. This was a fun way to spend the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linnea182
30,For younger children only,"I took my nieces, ages 14 and 10, to the Wildlife Learning Center -it was nice but really small. It took us 30 minutes to walk around and see everything. If you signed up for a tour, that would be more interesting, you get to interact with the animals. This venue would be more appropriate for smaller children. It is in a suburban neighborhood with no parking lot, so be prepared to park nearby and walk. We were able to park nearby. Looks like a nice place for a birthday party, and they also will bring the animals to your party elsewhere, for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparkyW22
50,"Small, but Highly Interactive Animal Experience, perfect for young children","We visited this place with our 4 and 7 year olds. It was a wonderful experience. My daughters were so scared of any moving creatures until this day. After we finished one full round, my daughters asked, if they could pet the Prairie Dogs or the Fox, which was a sign of the change that came within them. I am happy for them. The entry fee is very negligible, but there is a fee for petting or dining with any of the animals, which again, goes towards the maintenance of these animals, so no complaints, but only praises for the works they do. I would have joined as a volunteer, if the driving distance was less than 30 minutes, but I have to drive an hour, one way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gladyboy
40,Nice,"Nice place to visit at a good price. My daughters (ages 6 and 8) and I went with a friend and her daughter (age 3) and we were able to get through one presentation by a trainer and the entire facility (very slowly) in under an hour.Don't get me wrong, the place was well kept and very family friendly, but not very impressive if you've visited a place that rescues/adopts these kinds of animals.We started here, had lunch at a nearby park, and then let the kids play at the park till they were tired. They had fun but they didn't get the ""eyes filled with wonder"" look that they've gotten at other places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweet_Pisces
40,Small but Highly Interactive Animal Experience,"The Wildlife Learning Center is a pleasant escape from the crowded venues of Los Angeles. The Center is just a short drive north of Los Angeles in Sylmar. It's an ideal place for Los Angeles area residents to experience a wild animals at a slower pace and in a more intimate setting. Obviously, visitors to Los Angeles with limited time would do better to see the Los Angeles Zoo - a much larger facility with many more facilties.The Wildlife Learning Center is relatively small and in a nice shaded area. The repitile and amphibian center is in a trailer and has several frogs and snakes and other animals in aquarium-type tanks. Their habitants seemed small and that was one of my original concerns. Outside, there are several enclosures with various animals from around the world.According to their brochure, all animals are rescues or zoo-born. Some animals have been injured, such an eagle with a damaged wing, and they cannot survive in the wild. Again, I felt that the enclosures seemed small but everything was exceptionally clean and the animals all seemed to be well cared-for.What makes this center so unique is the ability to interact with the animals. On the hour, an animal is brought out for an up close interaction. During our time, a baby alligator was brought out and later a snake. We were allowed to gently tough the animals. Another real joy was being able to interact with animals that were being returned from an on-location learning experience. There were several volunteers around to ask questions and to give a more personal experience with the animals.As a reminder, this is a very small facility. It would only take a few short minutes to walk around the entire facility. The fun is stopping and looking at the animals and to also participating in the learning sessions. It's something different to do if you live locally and love animals.The facility is in a residential area that was also zoned for this type of facility. Next door, we could see horses, a giraffe and an ostrich. They are not part of the facility. We were told it is a private facility and the animals there are used for movies.There are snacks and bottled and canned drinks available and a small selection of t-shirts and souvenirs in the gift shop. Port-a-potties serve as restroom facilities. This is a very modest but pleasant facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
50,Perfect for young children,"A family with school aged children can get in and out in 30 minutes to an hour if you're pressed for time. It's very easy to find, right off the freeway. Only $6 for adults, $5 for kids under 12, very young children are free. Free street parking. Animal trainers give talks once an hour. We pet an alligator. Nice variety of animals. Big enough to learn something. Small enough to see everything. They also offer camps, classes, and birthday parties. When we are driving from the South Bay to Santa Clarita, Lancaster or beyond, it's a perfect place to let the kids stretch and have a snack after sitting in traffic. Much better than a gas station or fast food, and just as easy, given proximity to freeways. Bring your own snacks. They sell bottled drinks for $1.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaJenniTravel
