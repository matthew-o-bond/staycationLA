50,Kids have fun and learn,Its a great place to take the kids and explore. They have many activities that are hands on. My kids love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geniousiam
30,Similar to the Toronto Science Center...but not quite as good.,"Took 3 kids here (14,12 and 9) and it was a decent way to spend a couple of hours in the afternoon. Its not a ""must see"" by any means and considering the cost, I would give this place a pass next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EasyTravellerLam
10,Worst children’s Museum,"I love children’s museums and this is definitely my least favorite one. That is really disappointing because it is so close to my house. It lacks creativity, imagination and fun. The exhibits are boring and devoid of hands on opportunities, to used to think my kids were too young for it but then they went straight to too old without there having ever been a good time for them. There are way too many screens. The activities all seem like advertisements. The space has so much potential, I think they need to completely start over on the inside. Also, it is sooo hot even when it is barely hot outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanaz18
40,Fun for kids and adults,"We just made it to the last day of the dinosaur exhibit, which was fantastic, with huge animatronic dinosaurs moving their feet, heads, and bodies.But even without the dinosaurs there's lots of hands-on activities for kids of all ages. My granddaughter is 2 and she enjoyed her time there. At that age, however, there were some limits for her and she obviously needed to be guided along.But she really enjoyed the outdoor play areas! There were 3 different levels of play equipment so it's great if you bring one child or many.Parking was easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingFan22
50,Spring Break Day Trip,"I took the kids I nanny for the day, and they had an absolute blast! A great way for kids to have fun while learning and exploring the world and things around them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielles12345
40,Enjoyed our visit!,"Went with my husband, two of my sons, and their families. My grandkids are between 1 and 3 years old, and even though most of the museum was geared toward older children, the little ones still found it interesting. We spent just under two hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scvfelicia
30,Disappointing,"This just didn’t have much for my 3 and 5 year olds. It’s too much teaching and not interactive, play based learning and fun. The winter wonderland was fun, but if we would have paid admission and the cost of that, I would have found that a terrible value",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anna55711
40,Fun for Kids,Nice to place to visit for kids. Very clean and lots to do there...During the winter they have the slide and sleds. Friendly staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
50,We are mmbers of the Discovey Cube in the San Fernando Valley.,"Love taking our grandchildren to this venue. On the top floor is an entire exhibit of the L.A. Kings Hockey..You can get into hockey gear, get on a Zamboni, block pucks as you guard the net and watch videos of the players.There is also rock climbing, ,a hands on learning exhibit where you can find ways to help save electricity, go food shopping and ejoy a snack or lunch in their café.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop
40,"Not as big as the OC Cube, but still good","Went to the Discovery Cube of Los Angeles on a Saturday morning with my 6 year old son. Welcomed by a robotic T-Rex outside the museum. Purchased tickets on-line, so there was no wait. We saw the first 3D movie of the day, and had the whole theater to ourselves.Of the exhibits, my son liked the LA Kings hockey exhibits the best. He wanted to play the goalie simulation and shoot at the virtual goalie over and over again.The rest of the interactive exhibits had minimal wait time. While some exhibits are the same as the OC Cube, there are some differences. The helicopter ride has a different video than the OC.Great museum to take young children. Even though there are fewer exhibits than in OC, I felt we got more of our money's worth since it is less crowded than the OC Cube.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Great Indoor science fun,"So many hot and sunny days in SoCal. Sometimes kids get tired of the beach and we are always looking for new things to do and new neighborhoods to explore. That's when you head to the Discovery Cube. Lots of parking and reasonably priced entry. Once inside, it's a science and engineering world for kids. The new Dinosaur exhibit is fun and interactive. These days animatronic dinosaurs are pretty common but the Discovery Cube added a fossil dig and a play area too. The 3D movies are beautifully shot and entertaining while being educational. They have a well stocked cafe with food choices for everyone. It's well maintained with friendly staff.Added bonus: incredible public playground/park outside to extend your trip and make the drive there worthwhile.Tip: if you have one, use a sun shade for your car as the temps get pretty high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoShoEli
50,Science fun in my own backyard,I had been to discovery cube in Santa Anna but had no idea we had one in our own backyard! Super fun learning science with lots of hands on. Was a hit with both my 7 year old and my 11 year olds. Short wait times for a few activities but definitely easier to negotiate than the ever popular OC site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318elizabethe
50,Entertaining Grandkids,Discovered an ad for this location and decided to take our young grandsons and check it out. It's located next to the Hansen Dam Recreation Center and close to the 210 freeway. We parked and headed inside. It was a hot muggy day so an indoor activity was perfect. This is a great place to take children. Lots of hands on activities to keep them busy and stimulated. This is a great place for children between the ages of 4 and 10. Our grandson's are 7 and 9 and really enjoyed themselves. There is a small cafe with a limited menu. It's moderately expensive so pack a lunch and have a picnic at the Hansen Dam Recreation area. If you eat at the cafe factor about $12.50 per person. Our food was very good no complaints. Plan on 2 to 3 hours if you don't rush.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WMSCV
40,Awesome hands on experiences,"The Discovery Cube is close to where we live, and has a lot to offer young children. There are a plethora of activities for kids to do. There is a market where they have shopping cart and have to find certain items to scan. The cart has a monitor on it that gives them a question related to the item they must find and scan. There is a recycle area where kids have to sort recyclables and trash, not real of course and its a race to see who can scan and sort the fastest. There are robotic dinosaurs everywhere. There is an area upstairs devoted to the Kings hockey team with some neat activities for the kids to do, such as score on an NHL goalie or be an NHL goalie and try to stop the players shot. There is the obligatory gift shop of course. There is an eatery as well. It's a fun place with lots of activities for the kids. There is an annual membership available for $99/family which covers two adults and up to 4 kids. Neat place tucked away in the foothill community of Pacoima.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thematrix
40,Small museum but still fun for the kids,"We purchased a membership about a year ago, and have taken the kids here multiple times. It definitely pays itself off after a couple visits.The whole place is definetly on the small side. We normally spend a couple hours here, which gives you plenty of time to check everything out.The Cube is located about 2 minutes off the 210 fwy so it's a short drive for us. There are no parking fees which is a plus.One thing that I like is that they rotate some exhibits. On our last visit, they opened up a new dinosaur exhibit. This was very cool if you are into dinos. Lots of fossils, facts, and interactive displays to check out. This replaced the previous TMNT exhibit that they had before.The toddler area seems to have rotating exhibits also. They used to have a Dora exhibit which is a building play area now. There's also a little toddler dino exhibit in this area for the little ones.The other interactive exhibits seem to be mainstays. There's the LA Kings exhibit on the second floor. There are a couple recycling and reuseable exhibits which really get the kids involved. In the house on the end of the 1st floor, the kids learn about saving energy and being efficient by playing a Q&A scavenger hunt type game using a tablet.There are few other little interactive exhibits to check out. They do have a small theatre where you can watch a short 3D movie.There's also a cafe which we tried before. Food was decent, but it seemed to be overpriced for what it was. We normally bring our own snacks for the kids.They do have a nice little gift shop with some cool souvenirs. So even though this place is small compared to other museums, the kids have always had a fun time. Just don't expect to spend more than a couple hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tygerstile
50,Such a great place with great value. Kids love it,This is a diamond in the rough. I've seen the one off the 5 freeway but it's awesome that they built one in this part of town. Get the memberships if you can afford it. It's worth every dime. They change exhibits often so kids will see something new if you go every couple of months. It's great!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricktable
20,Not worth it... go to Science Center for free,"If you're coming to escape the heat, forget it. Little to NO AC in most of the building. Kings area especially is sweltering. Lots of sweaty bodies in an ice hockey area. Not good. We left quickly because we were miserable.Not to mention... Terrible awful horrible customer service!!!! SLOWWWWWWW line to check in. Took 10 minutes to get through turnstile with 2 families in front of us.Had a coupon which didn't specify rules and they refused to honor it. Not only in a very rude way, but acted like I was a jerk for attempting it. Come on- this place closes in 2.5 hours, and you're going to fight with me over $10? GOOD customer service would have made an exception- especially so close to the 5pm closing time.Kids maybe 8 and under will have some fun here, if it's not hot outside. Trip is Quick- maybe an hour of entertainment. The Kings area is definitely the highlight if it wasn't so hot in there.Want to keep people coming back? Honor a stupid $10. Off. Want to make it so people never come back? Treat customers like trash- I'm looking at you- Daisy in Customer Relations and you Vanessa- ""manager"" (Vanessa even raised her voice at me and I asked her not to yell.) Again, all over an UNCLEAR $10 admission coupon.Due to the rudeness of you two, and the lack of air conditioning, we will not be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAChaps
40,Go to meet LA Kings mascot Bailey!,"My girlfriend and I went to Discovery Cube LA for an event put on by the Los Angeles Kings. It was a birthday party for their Mascot Bailey. Also in attendance were Kings radio announcers Nick Nickson and Daryl Evans for a meet and greet, and they all signed autographs.It was the first time we'd been to Discovery Cube LA. Great place to take small children. Lots of interactive activities. And if you're a hockey fan, they have a cool ""Science of Hockey"" exhibit that's put on by the Kings.We were told that Bailey and the Kings go out there about once a month, and sometimes other Kings staff go as well.Well worth the drive from Ventura!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g0llum65
50,Wonderful interactive museum for children,Had a wonderful snow/sledding area outside for the Christmas holidays and a great Lego exhibit during the holidays. Fun for all and handicapped accessed. Very interactive exhibits for a great variety of ages - educational and fun at the same time. Adults as well as children enjoyed the museum and the interaction that it allowed between adults and children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PGlocal_12
50,The best spot for a hot day with kids,The discovery cube is one of this hidden diamonds. Great activities for those with young ones who need to burn energy and learn along the way!!! You will not go wrong trust me !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCaliAdvisor
50,Toddler Fun!,"We took my two year old grandson and he was active and occupied for over three hours! It is so toddler friendly, interactive and educational. Adults will learn too! He loved climbing the rock wall and the physically interactive experiments, especially the Santa Ana wind experience. He even had an encounter with R2D2!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crocHuntress
30,Great Concept,"Great space.Great Interactive exhibits.Biggest draw back was that there were No facilitators at certain exhibits to demo or explain so if you have 2 (or more kids) it is just one big playground with stuff that flies, makes a noise, makes wind, mini-movies, displays & buttons to push! Luckily we had a 1:1 adult child ratio to explain the displays.It seems that school groups and summer camp groups arrive in the morning and there are simply too many kids to deal with. It is a disaster! Camp leaders shouting for the kids to ""listen up"" / kids running around. Older kids in younger areas throwing equipment and wrecking others ""work"". No supervision which in effect ruins the experience.However once the happy campers left we managed to get around to figure some of the exhibits out.Highlights:• Dora explorer• Helicopter Semi-simulator with movie of California's water source• Superb real time interactive topographical map maker (with sand)• Great interactive (tablet interacts with clues in a mock up of a house) ""detective"" game, focuses on resource management /energy saving message.• Planet presentation - a bit confusing as sadly no audio or program. The Grandparents saw Earth with one child and a little later took 2nd child and saw Jupiter.Overall there is enough for little kids and bigger. Perhaps best suited for 1 -12yrs (max). Although bigger kids could assist younger siblings and still enjoy.Not an absolute must but an entertaining afternoon / morning out and a good activity if it is too hot or need something to do on a rainy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaarinH
30,Nice place to visit locally.,"Have waited a long time for this museum to open, had opportunity last week, during Passover vacation. Had a lot of adults along, to bring our 2 1/2 year old grandson.Got off to a bad start, when we could not find the entrance. Had three adults in car, all carefully watching the signs, and we missed it twice. Mentioned this to one of the employees, and they said that is a common occurrence.Museum itself very nice, open. Had a few exhibits that captured everyone's attention. Most notable the recycling contest!!Went upstairs and spent quite a bit of time on the ""Kings hockey"" exhibit. Lot's of fun, interactive things to do for all ages.Checked out upcoming events, and disappointed to hear that the ""bubbleman"" won't be coming there, because ""they can't afford it"".Overall compared to the OC one, a little bit of a let down. For the price (10 dollar introductory fee had been extended) and the close proximity to home, it was a nice afternoon. Bonus, was walking right outside and having the beautiful playgrounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shira76
50,Great for kids and grandparents,"We just had to get a fany membership for the parents. We loved time with our 8 year old grandson here. The right balance of fun entertainment with real science. Virtual hockey plays , simulated helicopter rides and all kinds of hands on science stuff like controlling steam rising. A decent cafe and plenty of sit down places for family. Go and enjoy with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661dees
50,"Discovery cube is good, but Impossible Science is GREAT,","I have to say that the only reason I jumped in an Uber Cab today from the Garland was to see what Jason Latimer was doing with his Impossible Science program.Mr Latimer is a world class magician. You might not know it from his current role as ""curator"" of the Impossible Science program, here at the LA Discovery Cube in Sylmar, but also in San Diego. There are glimpses of it when he does his brief stage shows throughout the day but the few magic effects he does are for one reason, and one reason alone....he wants to inspire wonder!To be sure, the experiments are pitched at a kids level, but there is an entirely different message for audiences of all ages.If all goes as Mr Latimer intends, the USA will have an entirely new cadre of science, technology, engineering and maths students to ask those interesting questions that move us forward as a society. The most important phrase in scientific discovery s not ""Eureka"". It's ""gee, isn't that interesting....?""The remainder of the discovery cube is interesting but somewhat abridged. Plan to spend a few hours...but get here before The Impossible Science project is over. You'll be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DouglasG127
10,Overall experience,Poorly organized. Inappropriate for preschool. The facility was not very clean and details of the prearranged preschool visit were not clearly explained to the school. Parents were asked to donate an additional $10.00 each so the children could have access to the entire facility.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816lf
40,Fun for young children...Set in nice park,"This the smaller of the two Discovery Cubes. The larger Cube is in Santa Ana and definitely has more activities. However, this center should not be dismissed because of what it doesn't have but what it does offer for entertainment to young children on the north side of LA. We took our 4 year old granddaughter here for the day. Her parents are annual members so the entry fee was covered. There are a lot of hands on activities for all ages from toddlers to young teens. Most exhibits deal with weather and environmental topics and teach the children about recycling, energy saving, and other topics regarding southern California. There is a booth where you can experience hurricane winds (75mph), a fog tornado simulator, a grocery store where the children can shop for groceries, pulley systems where children can lift themselves in chairs and an area dedicated to hockey where they can practice hockey shots, play goalie and pretend to skate and even Zamboni. Our granddaughter would have stayed all day. If you are on the north side and do not want to drive to Santa Ana, this is a great safe place to take your young children. The Discovery Cube is 5 minutes off I-210 in the nice Hansen Dam Recreation Area that has plenty of free parking and lots of area to picnic and nice playgrounds. The website gives exact directions on how to get to the parking lot, so do not rely on GPS to get you there. There is a small café inside that offers a variety of adult size and child size lunches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennessee50plus
30,Zzzzzzz,After an hour and a half in this museum my grandkids 3 and 6 yrs old got bored. They were expecting this place to be similar to the one in Santa Ana. It's smaller and less things to do. The opening promo price of $10.00 entrance is what enticed me to check it out with the little ones. Regular price of 16.95 for adults and 12.95 for kids 3 to 14 is expensive for this place. There is not much to do on the second floor. Employees have no enthusiasm in assisting the kids. This museum is located in Hansen Dam. Be on the lookout for the signs that directs you to this place or you'll miss it. It is next to a playground. GPS does not work once you enter the park. Cafeteria does not offer much. Bring your own grub and have a picnic outside at the park overlooking the dam or next to the playground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
30,Small clone,Took the small grandkids while the $10.00 special is still on. This place is smaller than the OC venue. Has less thngs to do too. After an hour and a half my 6 yr old grandson got bored . He has done all activities in that short span of time. The 2nd flr has barely have anything to see and do. After the promo entrance fee it's not worth to pay full price to see this place. Make sure to pay attention to the signs directing you to this place. It's at Hansen Dam where GPS does not work. The building is right nxt to the playground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vic2826
40,"Smaller, cheaper clone of the Santa Ana Discovery Cube","First off all, take the time to read the Directions and Parking from their website. The LA Cube's official address is NOT where you want to try parking. We followed my phone's Google Maps to 11800 Foothill Blvd, looked around, and could NOT figure out where the heck we were supposed to go. After parallel parking on the street outside an apartment complex, we walked around and finally found a security guard by the delivery entrance who clued us into the real directions. Don't make the same mistake we did. (In other words, go down Dronfield into the Hansen Dam parking lot).We're Cube members and have already been to the Orange County one many times, so there was a lot about the LA Cube that was familiar: The Eco Challenge shopping cart thing with the handheld scanners, the Race to Recycle truck game, and the Inspector Training are all nearly identical to OC. Science of Hockey, the Aquavator, and the Helicopter Tour are also there. But at least most of it is newer. Race to Recycle at OC is old, has fewer items, and a lot of their items are missing yellow stars. The Aquavator is bigger and has two screens. And the LA Helicopter Tour is much more scenic (and motion sick-inducing) than OC. Hockey is sponsored by the LA Kings instead of the Anaheim Ducks, but otherwise the exhibit equipment is all the same.No Dino Quest. No Rocket Lab. No Shake Shack. Not much else going on, really. It felt like the place was less than half the size of the OLD OC Cube, let alone after Orange County's expansion. Plus, they seemed understaffed. For example, there wasn't anyone manning the Helicopter Tour exhibit, so pretty much anyone could walk in whenever they wanted, which was distracting.The big benefit to the LA cube for people who have been to OC is that LA has different featured exhibits. While OC is running Hot Wheels right now, LA has Curious George. And LA is also much cheaper at $10/admission for now.All in all, my kids enjoyed both the familiarity of OC Cube exhibits and also the excitement of being somewhere ""new"". I'm not sure we'd make the trek all the way to LA just to visit this place, but if you're in the area and need to kill an hour (or two hours, max), then stop on by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrHickenlocher
50,This is the way a kids museum should be!,"My 5 year old daughter LOVED this place. Why? For one thing, there was poop. Oodles and oodles of poop. Poop of many animals and nations. And kids, if you don't have one, LOVE poop. We took a helicopter which flew into a private home, dove down the toilet and toured the sewer - all while getting splattered with poop! There was also an exhibit on the physics of ice hockey. Did I mention that they had lots of exhibits on poop?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814charlesz
50,My Nieces Loved It,"My nieces (ages 6 and 9) loved the Discovery Cube. Their favorite part was the ""Grossology"" exhibit upstairs which was all about animals and insects. There was a great display showing how a cow's four stomachs digest their food. The exhibits were very interactive for the kids and they are ready to go back with their cousins. The facilities were very clean and cheery with ample staff to assist. We had lunch at the little Bean Sprouts cafe and really enjoyed our sandwiches and pizzas. They had fun food choices for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BasinBarrett
40,"Went for the day, bought it for the year!","Thomas the Train, Dinosaurs, Clifford the Big Red Dog and lots of other cool science stuff. There is a rotating theme that lasts for a few months. The aforementioned themes have been there for the last year that we have been members. This is a great place to burn off some of that kid energy, its air-conditioned and there is a terrific outdoor playground right next door if they still have too much energy to burn off.The simulated helicopter ride, the grocery store shopping, and the current hockey exhibit are all favorites for my kids 8, 4, and 3.By the way, the membership is tax deductible and very affordable for me and my three kids. you can have up to 4 kids and two adults. If you live within a few miles of this north San Fernando Valley attraction and your kids are still in elementary school you can't go wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844jasonw
50,Indoors and entertaining!,This place was awesome for my kids ages 3 to 10. The highlight of course was the Los Angeles Kings exhibit which allowed us to to take shots on J Quick. We loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crease131
40,Hands On!,The children love this museum. Thanks of making it hands on so the kids can discover science and their world by touching everything. Bring the whole family and spend a couple of hours there. Bring a lunch and picnic at their tables.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrSteve818
50,For Kids 3 to 13 what a great place to spend a day.,The elevator into the earth was great so was the trash truck. Really liked all of the space and the kids all seamed to be liking the freedom to explore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greattimes7
40,My Gkids love it,"The place is very busy as it should. The kids loved the Zamboni,,,hockey and especially the fly and poop displays. I am telling you the restaurant is the very best I have ever had for a kids place. Organic, wonderful healthy salads I arrived at 1030a had a healthy lunch didn't weigh down the kids nor me so we were ready for part 2.. My Gkids are young so lots of things were too old for them but the things they liked held their attention. Do not take your child and sit and watch. You gotta read with them and help them understand. That's my super helpful hint",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonKc
50,Fun to visit with kids!,"Very nice place with tons of interactive exhibits for kids to visit, great family atmosphere. Fun pretend shopping and recycling area, my kids loved the pretend house and trying to find the problems using an iPad. Great place to escape summer heat and adjacent to a very nice park in Sylmar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahP898
50,Great for Kids,"We don't have kids but enjoy almost any museum and since the new Discovery Cube LA is near our home, we checked it out. Even though it is geared toward children and families, we enjoyed our visit.There were exhibits on molecules, how a tornado is formed, a simulator ride of flying through the water and sewer system, a child size grocery store, sorting recyclable trash, a house where children search for hazards, and more. A traveling exhibit on Animal Grossology was very interesting, but a little gross, but won't be there long before a new traveling exhibit takes its place. We watched a short 3D movie on Dinosaurs but the penguin movie (which we didn't see) might have been more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Great rotating exhibits,"My 4 and 2 years old enjoyed this place. It is not very big, but they like the helicopter simulator, shopping at the supermarket, recycling, playing in the toddler area, the Thomas exhibit etc. The day out is complete with playing in the neighboring Hansen Dam park area. The sand pit is quite nice so remember to bring sand toys. The cafeteria has healthy kids-friendly choices. We bought the annual membership because there is a good promotion going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/memorybau
20,Limited amount for toddlers,"We primarily came to see the Thomas & Friends exhibit having missed it at the OC.My toddler had a good time but we felt the area could have had so much more. Generally speaking there just wasn't enough for all the kids there. Glad it was only the reduced $10 price.Climb inside Thomas' cab to explore the engine's inner workings - means pull a few levels & see the boiler coming on. It's fun once but space limited for about 3 kids at a time.Remove and replace parts to fix Percy's wobbly wheel- this was fun once or twiceLoad Percy's coal box and water so he can deliver the mail - essentially 2 wheels to turn with enough space for maybe 3 children. It is one of the better parts however.Suit up as the conductor and sell tickets to ride the train- there were 3 or 4 hats & navy coats with no Thomas branding & too big for the average toddler there.Load and sort luggage and freight into train cars - there was 2 suitcases & 3 paint pots & a few bags of corn, not enough to go round. There was one seat for kids to sit in & 3 open carts so not much to hold their attention.Explore the history of Thomas & Friends through books, TV show clips and toys - the history was missing & very few of newer engines are recognized in any way.There was a large wooden tracked railway set up & a separate room with 3 Thomas tables & plenty wooden tracks to build your own railway but very few actual engines going around. We counted approximately 10 ( causing great distress to kids who couldn't get one) but plenty of Annie & Clarabel & troublesome trucks. None of the modern toys. All the tracks & engines looked old & chipped.The things that really annoyed me was a majority of the engines are on sale for $12 each in the gift shop. Im sure they could spend a little & even have the complete set of engines on display & some more to play with.A few book available but nothing old, only books of the modern US movies. Again well worn.Someone had the bright idea of putting a loud radio which played a long story next to the tv with no way of turning it off meaning both were hard to hear.The clips werent really informative regarding the history. The toy design guy basically said we think about what would be fun to play with & make that.Plan and build navigation routes to favorite destinations on the gigantic Island of Sodor train table. - means a poster on the wall asking you questions about the routes but no map of Sodor so you can work it out. The table was in no way a proper map of sodor.Everything looks well used. Percy's lantern & some coal was broken. In fact the whole building looked like it wasn't quite ready.The advertised storytime wasn't a story it was a member of staff with a clock asking the kids to figure out which engine had to leave according to the time label on them.In regards to the rest of the displays which were related to nature disasters & the Kings ice hockey. The helicopter ride was fun. The rock wall was goodThe recycle house and the supermarket game where you have to find particular items were fun for older kids.There was a lot of touch screens which weren't very responsive. The recycle conveyor belt game was missing parts.On the second level there wasn't much for a toddler to enjoy but the ice hockey had parts where you could be a goalie or try to score a goal which looked fun. Again dinosaur part was aimed at older children.The 4D cinema was 3D with a bit of smoke.The cafe within serves nice food mainly pizza & sandwiches. Individual pizza about $7. Bottled water $2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bugbiten
50,Amazing place. Must see for kids.,Amazing exhibits. Fantastic shows and science themes for kids. You can spent hours Without a problem. Truly good food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vageliskos
50,Great science adventure for children,"Finally a children's science museum in the San Fernando Valley. Not as big as the Exploratorium in San Francisco, but with lots of fun for kids. There's a simulated helicopter tour of California, a chance to be a home energy-savings inspector, a dinosaur exhibit and much more. My grandchildren had a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaSandy
50,Great exhibits for all ages,This museum is really cool. A lot of fun exhibits that kids and adults will find interesting. We took our 4 year old to the Thomas the train exhibit and had to peel him out. Very hands on place where you can have a healthy lunch and sit outside or play on the park equipment right outside. Extremely clean and well maintained with very knowledgeable staff. Definitely going back for the ice hockey exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derikl2013
50,Not too big but good fun,A little smaller than I envisioned. Has some great hands on scientific experiments on the 2nd floor. The bottom floor has a few attractions that are modern and interesting. Overall I would recommend especially since the admission is only $10 per person until June 2015.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raylaw323
10,What a disappointment!,"Even at the grand-opening price of $10 per person, you would think they would offer a good experience...think again. This is just another waste of tax-payer money to push the global-warming/sky-is-falling agenda on poor innocent children. I took my boys there and we literally saw and experienced everything in about 30 minutes. Don't waste your time or money. For a great (free) experience, head downtown to the California Science Center. The exhibits are amazing, there is more than can be done in a day...and it's free! I can't see this place remaining open very long, especially when they bump up the cost to full price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baylyboy
30,First Timers,"We visited the cube as part of 10 year old's birthday weekend in SoCal. Easy to get to, prices are good ($10/ person special going on) and not crowded. Honestly I expected more exhibits, but those that were there are good and informational. We especially enjoyed the interactive game where a kid can be a home inspector. The grocery market and recyclable games were fun also. I had a couple of teenager's with me and they thought it was ok. It was short-lived and worth a one time visit for us, but don't think we'll be returning. It IS surrounded by a beautiful park where you can spend time with little ones and enjoy a nice picnic if you plan your visit well. (We were off to Venice, so did not visit the park).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beatrice_RN
50,Shiny and Brand New,"We visited during the holidays and found the ""Cube"" easy to find, easy to park and easy to navigate. There were lots of interesting displays and exhibits for the kids to explore and we felt safe there as it's not overpacked with people and exhibits (yet). They are offering grand opening special rates and you don't have to pay for parking - this is a no-brainer for parents looking for something educational (but still fun) to do with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
