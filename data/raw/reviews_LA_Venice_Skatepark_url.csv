40,Amazing to watch,"This was a fun place to visit. Watching the skateboarding was fun and won’t disappoint. So much talent out there.

I was in awe of how talented everyone was, but even more in awe that everyone was polite, got along, and even applauded for extra-special tricks. It's not all 20-year-old guys, either; there were some kids around 6th grade or so, and several young ladies that were completely at home and accepted.The facility is gorgeous: right in the center of the beach, with ADA access for those who need it. Lovely bowls with soft edges, plus some ""pools"" with steep edges. It seems like you'd have to be a local to feel comfortable here, but everytime we showed up, we felt like we belonged. Totally, 100% recommended, even if you never thought you'd want to watch someone skateboard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck_from_SantaCruz

40,Great to watch - to intimidating to try!,"You can happily spend half an hour here watching locals and other pros shredding it up doing stunts on skateboards and scooters. It's the sort of thing that would be fun to try but, as my kids said, you've got to get good first! It's right on the seafront just north of Muscle Beach (so not near Venice Pier) and I imagine it draws a crowd most days.

Miks subkultur iI had a lot of concepts in my mind about this place. Hard to call it a tourism attraction so when you switch to ""be"" there instead of ""sightseeing"" you can absorb much more.
