50,Family Time,"Great place to take the family and have a good time. You can order food, bowl and play games. Plenty of things to do.",Ed O
50,FUN,"Come early; at opening time if you have kids with you. The place is clean and safe, The sheriff's office is in the mall itself and they make their presence known. The pizza is just tasteful enough for kids. They have light bowling balls and shoe sizes for kids and above all they have the kids bowl on one end away from the adults. Of course parents have to stay with their kids..",bebemeren
50,Amazing!,"Bowling, drinking, moving the arcade forwards with the latest games (playable online) while others fail to innovate. This is a place where you can hang out and not only play video games. I was really impressed with the imported and up to date games they have, as well as the cheap price of beer & bowling. Fed up of run down arcades with old games. This place was spotless.",ArcadeEnthusiast
40,Great place for bowling and drinking,"Great place for bowling and drinking. If you want to spend some time having fun, while the wife shops, this place is it.",JC D
40,Round One Team Pary,"Had our youth (8 year olds) baseball team party at the Round One in Moreno Valley and the kids loved it! We did 2 hours of bowling (3 lanes total), 30 min in the big party room for awards and then they did the time arcade games for an hour.Staff there was very helpful every step of the way!! Our food came out on time and without any issues. I would definitely come back to host another team party or just bring my kids here.They have everything you can think from good pizza and wings to bowling, arcade games, pool, and so much more. I can't wait to go back!",Iggy
40,Good times.,Place is clean and well run. Employees were friendly and readily available. Unlimited package is a great deal if you have the stamina to bowl more than 5 or 6 games.,PhillipC77
40,Loads of variety,"There's a lot to do here. Bowling, Ping Pong, Crane/Claw games and even Kareoke. It's all very fun. Just a bit costly. But a lot of fun!!!",ddub718
30,Great place,"I go there all the time to win the dolls. My girlfriend has so many hello kitty dolls, she has nowhere to put them all.",Leng C
50,So fun...,"came here with my gf to play table tennis and a few games. The claw game are so addicting, didn't win anything, but it was so fun!!",mslick53
50,"Lots of attractions, clean & new","We were visiting my father in nearby Hacienda Heights and decided to check this out. Cleanest/nicest bowling alley i've been to. Everything was organized, new, and shiny! It wasn't TOO pricey, but it did get crowded fast. We were able to snag a lane and keep buying more games as we pleased, without being booted off due to the waiting list. Played some ping pong and arcade games too. Overall nice place.",rnikkhoo
40,Pricey but fun,"I went here on a Thursday night, and it was still busy! Prices are definitely more than average, but it is a fun environment. You can play pool, go bowling, play arcade games, and sing karaoke. They also have a bar to pick up some drinks. The selection is pretty limited though.",Jeffrey A
30,"Nice place, but overpriced","Nice place to hang out and bowl, but the prices are way too high. A round of bowling plus shoe rental for 5 of us cost almost $40 and it lasted 30 mins.The food/beer was good, but again, overpricedMake sure you have ID at night because they card!",Jesse81
40,"Been here enough times, decent place to kill time","This place caters more to the tween crowd, with the video games and plethora of activities, but it does have things for everyone (pool, karaoke and bowling). While I think the prices are high, there are times that you will find a game on free play (someone swiped their ""time"" card)...can't go wrong if you find this place...but yes, lots of teenagers and young folk.",D L
40,Great fun!,"Took me a while before I finally visited this place but now I love it! So much to do and although a tad pricey, still worth it for a fun night out with friends.",jay_888
