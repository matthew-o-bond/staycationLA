10,WARNING: Message Envy injured me for life.,"I was permanently injured by a stretch message here. They made me an old man overnight.They then purposefully concealed the name of the massuese and had my review deleted on Yelp. Yes, they're that evil.Message Envy has been sued over 400 times (Just Google Message Envy Lawsuits) - this is a very big warning. Had I known this, I would never have darken these doors. I've had MRI's and now neurologists over the accident that happened here.DON'T GO TO MESSAGE ENVY. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.",mark g
50,The best staff!,"Having gone to this location for about 3 years now, I can tell you that the team at this location is above par. The desk staff is led by the customer savvy, Heidi, and they all go above and beyond to care for their clients. Once you are paired with a therapist, you won't be disappointed - yes, we all have certain things we like and don't but if you give the staff all the parameters they will usually pair you well. Even when my preferred therapist is away they are able to pair me with someone else that is a perfect fit for my preferences. The value is excellent and the care that the staff and therapists give to each client is stellar.",Zee P
40,Nice place,"Impressed with the decor and amisphere, I went there while they were running a special. The place is nice, except I was hoping to have pressure point peurathetic service, but it was too light in the work. Wish can get more out of my one hour.",J L
10,Bad Service,"Very nice clean place. Friendly staff, masseuses are not experienced. Once they get experience, they leave.",Martha B
40,Great service for the price,"Very nice atmosphere, large comfortable waiting room, 85% of the therapists I had were 4 out of 5 stars. One con: The great ones keep leaving for greener pastures.",SusanB933
