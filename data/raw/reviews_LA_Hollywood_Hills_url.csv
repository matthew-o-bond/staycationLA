40,Envious,"Took a cab to see the hollywood sign and than thought to walk around the place on foot and see if i come across any super hero driving around but with no such experience i was left to see the homes, envy is the word that comes to mind when u see the amazing mansions, every other immaculate and unique, could get some good ideas for your house :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dr_usmanm
50,Driving around the hills,"We drove around the Hollywood Hills on a couple of different days. There are many winding roads to navigate, but it‚Äôs worth it to see the huge mansions. Get to the top to get a nice view of the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HOCKPOOH
50,Take a tour,"We drove around some of the Hollywood Hills travelling from Hollywood Blvd to Griffith park and then back again, some special locations past and some amazing homes, well worth a viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
40,Iconic Hollywood Hills,"Hollywood Hills with its iconic big sign is a must see for pretty much everybody visiting LA. The sign itself is just a sign, but it's white Hollywood text somehow makes you feel good when you see it. Driving around the hills and wondering the size and form of different houses is entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
40,"Excellent Scenery, drive or hike","You can drive around the hills or hike from the Griffith Observatory and get close to the Hollywood sign. Either way, the views are excellent of the hills and the impressive houses and of LA itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimmaarouf
40,Great Hiking Can be very hot in the Summer,Best way to enter the park is from the bottom. You can have an Uber take you to the top of N Vista Street and the entrance is on your right. Best to Uber as there is very little parking. Also the first part of the hike is steep and the way down is much easier when you are tired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
50,üèòüèö,"Hollywood hill is worth the drive through. Impressive mansions,beautiful gardens and entrance ways. As always, it is also beautiful at night with all the properties being lit up. It makes one dream!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyinparistimestwo
40,Great to see!,"This is worth seeing. Great views with a steep and narrow road up to it. Quite a distance away and that was the highest point our guide could get to in an SUV. Different to what I imagined, but now I can relate to it when I see it on tv etc. Another tick off my bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaM1412
40,Was an experience!,"We decided to drive up into the Hollywood Hills to get a closer look at the sign. The drive up into the hills is on a super steep road, very narrow, tight hard-to-see-around turns and houses literally right on the edge of the street. We drove up as high as we could - Mulholland Dr was blocked off to tourist traffic and there was literally no way to park and walk or anything. It was even really tough to turn around! Going up the hill you got glimpses here and there of the sign, but not a big, whole sign visible type view. Actually, before we started driving up the steep hill, we saw all sorts of people running out to the middle of the street to get pictures of the sign. We stopped too and did the same thing, and we were glad we did as that was really the best view - up on the hill you really don't get that picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98
40,Take a drive thru the Hills,"Great views! Twists, turns but worth the views! Lovely homes and canyon drive! You must drive - not walk - best views are after you climb up to top and wind thru the canyon. Beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xeanie
40,"Steep, but good views","Walking around the hillsides close to the Hollywood Sign and Griffith Observatory, the steep inclines are well worth climbing to overlook Los Angeles. Whilst downtown isn‚Äôt all that, it‚Äôs good to see the city from a different perspective.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09
40,See the homes of the stars !,"We visited the Hollywood Hills as part of the Deluxe LA Tour with StarLine Tours of Anaheim. As well as giving great views of the famous Hollywood sign and the city of Los Angeles itself, it's also a great opportunity to spot the current and former homes of the stars if you have a knowledgeable guide. Overall a very interesting trip well worth doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92stem
30,No that intersting,"We decided to walk on Hollywood Hills with hope that we can have some nice views to the city. But because of houses and trees we couldn't see too much. It was a good exercise, whole area is beautiful and peaceful, there are plenty of very nice houses but due to the signs informing about the security measures they use to protect their homes and what happens if you not stay away I felt not welcome. I wouldn't go there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvaF2Eva
30,Stay downtown,"There is really very limited interest here. Go up to see where the rich people live?....boring go up to see the ""Hollywood"" sign....no good access and not much of a view of the actual sign. So stay down in the lowlands and see something of real interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto

40,The Humble House,"I didn't expect the house to be just 'ordinary'. It's basically a neighbourhood, with a narrow and hilly road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/destinationnone
30,See it on a tour.,"If you're interested in checking out the homes of the celebrities, use a tour company since you won't know what you're looking at without a ""star"" map. Even if you get one, it doesn't mean that you'll see much given that most celebrities value privacy above all else, which in turn means that you'll see a lot of high walls and gates surrounding expensive estates. Beverly Hills is a better option if you want to see how the ""rich & famous"" live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
30,Nothing special,It's nothing special to see. Road are very small and curvy. Good way to get to the Hollywood sign only.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackson321

50,Great for a drive and for views of the Hollywood Sign,Prepare to drive up and down narrow roads for a view of the Hollywood Sign. Worth it for the views but not the easiest place to drive around. Houses are worth seeing too however residents are very conscious of people driving through.Once you have seen the sign there isn't much else to do so best to move on to somewhere else. Would recommend the views from Lake Hollywood Park than from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHannah172

40,Be careful not to get a parking ticket but fun experience.,Went through Runyon Canyon to see the hollywood hills and the hollywood sign with my girlfriend. I parked on the street being that other vehicles were parked on the side of the street and the free park space was completely full. Then we hiked through Runyon Canyon. Not a long hike at all maybe 10 mins max. Got to the top got to see a beautiful view of Los Angeles and got to see the hollywood sign. Came back and to my surprise I got a 120 dollar parking ticket. The problem is that you have to being parked within the signs of the street and if any part of your car passes that in my case was a tiny bit of my backend of my SUV you will get a ticket. Please be careful and READ THE SIGNS CAREFULLY and follow the arrows of the signs.. The ticket police is everywhere their.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevind473

20,Stinks of Dog urine and trash,"What a waste of a hillside. Off leash dogs run amok. Numerous dog attacks on other dogs and people. Dogs killed, children attacked. No park personal, over 90 acres with no bathrooms or potta potties. No parking anywhere, they really ticket including stings on illegal use of handicap placards. The place reeks of dog urine (and human waste!)... The hillside is stripped and denuded of plant life due to dogs running off leash. Great views on a clear day... rare in LA....better views off of Mulholland Drive, up off Outpost Drive...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVinca

40,Nice Change Away From Busy LA,"We visited the Hollywood Hills as part of an LA Tour, the road up is very windy and you could see some of the beautiful homes lots owned by Stars, but mostly they were away from prying eyes the views from there across LA were very good, we didn't see any Stars. It was a lovely leafy place, very private for those who live there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshineqld

50,Walk the hills to see the locals and city views,"We were staying in Hollywood, and looking for something to do in the morning before the late evening flight home. We walked the Runyon Canyon hills. Big Tip - take an Uber to the North Entrance on Mulholland Drive and walk down hill. The trail is moderately steep in parts and the main trail is paved, but much easier walking down hill. You get to see all the locals walking, their designer dogs, and through the smog, good views of the city and hills. You don't need a tour guide, its free. Good option if the Observatory is too busy, or you are just tired of the whole tourist crowd thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickwV2495OU

20,Disappointing,"We thought we were going to be able to go right up the to famous Hollywood sign for a photo shot. Not at all what happens. You drive through a huge crowd of cars, pay to park, go to a fence and WAY int the distance, you can see the sign. If you are in excellent physical shape and have the time, you can hike to the sign- watch out for snakes, But if you are limited on time, just skip this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytraveler4209

20,Nice to tour through the area.,"Nice to see the area, see some of the really nice homes with great views. However, don't expect to get too close to any of them and actually see them up close and personal. As anyone would, the people that live in these houses like their privacy, so the houses you can get close to from the road have high fences or hedges that all but prevent seeing the house. The ones that are far away are visible, but they are just that, far away from the roads you are on. I enjoyed touring them, but just understand you are unlikely to get a good look at any of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSRBOB

50,More than the Sign,"Although born in the flats of Los Angeles, as soon as I was out of college I ended up living in the Hills. There are lots of hilly areas---all of which which become more and more expensive the further WEST you go. . . until finally you are at the ocean. Having lived in most of the hills at one time or another, I have a long time perspective about all this and, of course, many of my friends still live in the Hollywood Hills area---so I'm there all the time. The area is always interesting, because its old and new HOLLYWOOD. . .and hiking there is nice, because its an old wooded area and the architecture is old for LOS ANGELES (few things prior to 1900) and better than the seedy urban scene of actual Hollywood. The older homes that are still there, can be built crazily into spaces no one could get away with building in TODAY what with earthquake and other laws. And there is ALWAYS a history of some sort to most of these homes---though not necessarily what some celebrity home map or tour bus driver tells you. Even if you aren't lucky enough to get to see a celebrity, if you drive the hills you will see interesting homes and get a sense of what Hollywood is and was always like. . .think Nathanial West's Day of the Locust---the book, not the film. In the more expensive hills (Beverly Hills, Brentwood) real estate developers and foreign buyers are tearing down the beautiful old homes and building what in my opinion, are ugly mega mansions. . .sometimes plain ugly modern boxes . . . sometimes the same ""white house"" design with 5500 square feet on a teeny lot. Hey, its all a matter of taste. But. . .before even Hollywood Hils become victimized, if you want to see what Los Angeles WAS really like. . .take a drive up there. . . because it could be gone before you know it. If you are a terrible drive, hire a car. And, if you find the park or a trail, do it BUT REMEMBER and understand that neighborhood/neighbors aren't happy if you drive like an idiot, take up all the parking and locals can't get to their homes because you don't know what you are doing. Pull over if you are having problems negotiating the road. And. . .IF you walk in the hills, know that its not a myth: there are rattle snakes, they are dangerous/poisonous, and they are ALWAYS there year round. The baby rattlers are more dangerous than the big ones. Hearing the rattle of a snake I could not see, while walking dogs off leash on a hike, was one of the single scariest moments of my existence. There are no bathrooms/water/anything and you probably want to do it early in the day. Spend an hour or two. . .or, just view the sign from far away and read some books on the subject. Its all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodaspoetry
50,View from hotel room,"We had a view of the Hollywood hills from our hotel room and I must say that it was better than the view from the front of the hotel.

50,Homes of Hollywood Hills are Beverly Hills Bungalows WITH A VIEW.,I have numerous friends that have had homes in the hills. They are not nearly as large as homes down in the flats of Beverly Hills but they are much more innovative and have spectacular views. Many homes are built into the sides of the mountain and end up being five stories tall. They have pools that are cantilevered over a cliff. Take a drive down the winding Laurel Canyon or Cahuenga Boulevard to get a glimpse of some of these fantastic residences.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895johnw

Looking forward to try some different paths the next time I'm there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristentuell
50,Go by car not a tour,So many gorgeous homes to see. The landscaping on the winding roads is fun to see. The important homes you can not see they have 10 ft hedges. We went on a tour bus last year just get to see a few homes and it was very costly. Get a car and you see so much more so worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546

30,Not the most interesting place to visit!!,"We visited LA and stayed in the Marriot which was beautiful , however one of the first things on our list was to see the BH hills and walk of fame , both however were rather a let down , the hills had some lovely homes but you had to drove all over the place to try and find any stand out ones , the best photo we got of the Hollywood sign was from the Griffin park observatory, I know you can get closer but we tried and gave up as time was a premium. As for the walk if fame, well this was a massive let down, we genuinely thought that they were in a prestigious location amongst all the glitz and glamour you envisage LA has but to see Grace Kelly's star all dirty and stuck outside a kebab shop it was certainly not what we expected , certainly nothing to write home about .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovethehoops67

Interesting to see where some of the big names live - it brings it closer to reality!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roseyr538
40,Did you say villas???!!!,"Known for the famous personalities that own many of the villas in Hollywood, we visited this place with a guide who made us walk past many of the houses. Of course it was just a succession of gates and little else and in fact you can‚Äôt really see much. It is mostly just passing by without even stopping. But I leave this judgment aside because it is a very quiet place where you don‚Äôt realize that you are in Los Angeles (city with more than 13 million habitants and inexplicable traffic!). Anyone who lives in such a busy city would want to run away to this hill for a little tranquility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking

50,Relax & drive around,"Famous neighborhood surrounding Hollywood. Take your car on a sunny day and enjoy driving up and around these tiny streets, looking at hilltop mansions and the higher you go, the better the view.

40,Private Tour,"We drove around ourselves in a rental with the ever necessary GPS. Fun to look at how the other half lives, the utility poles disguised as palm trees etc. Be prepared for the windy roads and cyclists. Also, if you drive near the speed limit you risk the wrath of the locals who insist on driving at break neck speeds because they are sooo important, only to encounter them at the next stop sign. there are pull outs along some of the more scenic sections for picture taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonCricfils

50,Gorgeous panoramic vista and healthy hike to the American flag behind the Hollywood sign,"We parked at Griffith park and hiked as close to the Hollywood sign. We kept going until my son pointed to the flag and the people by it above the Hollywood sign. We continued walking, followed people and met people coming back until we found the windy trail up.It was a great feeling to have reached the flag after relatively steep stretches of the windy trail! The 4 p.m. sun peeking behind the clouds with glorious rays coming through and glistening on the Pacific Ocean beyond LA was a gorgeous vista! Different parts of the trail had panoramic views of different areas of LA. Grass along the trail has this magnificent green color!My family members and I definitely enjoyed the hike together and all the people we hiked up and down with!The summit has only the flag and beautiful view in all directions. There is no water fountain and restrooms. Our decision to hike was spontaneous so we did not have water. It is advisable to have a bottle of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElsaCL

Views of The surrounding hills and parts of LA from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
50,Don't Miss It,"Have lived in this area for more than 20 years. When picking someone up from the airport, I always take them up the 405 (north from LAX), get off on Mulholland, and then head east all the way across, so the visitor can see the views (south towards the ocean, Catalina, downtown LA and Beverly Hills, and north across the Valley). This drive is also great at night, for the views of all the city lights. Another great view is to take Laurel Canyon to Lookout Mountain (it's a T, so you can only turn west on Lookout), and then drive uphill, all the way to the top. When you reach the top, either take a hard, hairpin right at the stop sign, drive on for about two minutes, and you will get an amazing view of Beverly Hills and Century City and the ocean. OR, go straight through the stop sign, drive on for about 2 minutes, and you will get an incredible view of the ocean (looking east), DTLA, the Hollywood sign, and maybe even some giant tankers out on the ocean. GPS and cell signals may not work up here, so consider having an actual paper map to get you back out of there. Or, ask a friendly local walking by with their dog. Don't miss this! Aside from the views, seeing this vantage point will help you get your bearings in this giant city and understand what is where. There is no more sprawling, spread-out, and hard to comprehend city than this - only one I've seen that comes close is Johannesburg, South Africa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eversincethen

This is not that interesting to blow several hours on.The Hollywood Hills has some nice views, from some spots you can see the Hollywood sign and from other areas you can see all of Downtown LA. If you really want to drive up winding roads in neighborhoods where you don't live to see the sign or downtown, then I guess go for it, but really, it is not worth the trip.It is a neighborhood, people live there, do not stop your car to pick their fruit trees and have your photo taken. You will not be greeted with warmth, but as a trespasser.There is very little room to park, the streets are very narrow and can get crowded.If you really want to see the Hollywood sign, go do that (up through Franklin), there is a place to park and you can see the City, but stay out of the Hills, you don't live there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

50,Hiking,Hiking the Hollywood sign is a must have being in Los Angeles. Getting close to the sign you can just realize how big those letters are. All around nice views for selfies. Three hiking tracks from easy to difficult. Ask the ranger at Griffith Observatory for a map.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesseBlue
30,Take a tour which includes Hollywood Hills,I wouldn't go here by myself.

Laura was easy to listen and had lots of local knowledge. A thoroughly enjoyable afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/866soniaw
50,A piece of heaven,"A place out of L.A., in the middle of nature (including deer and coyotes), surrounded by beautiful mid-century houses, old hippies shacks, and most recently by (sometimes ugly nouveau riche) daring mansions. A piece of heaven and a piece of history. The drive on the top of the hills on Mulholland is stunning ... take the scenic route from Outpost to Coldwater canyon and beyond and get lost in the small hillside streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedSkirrel
40,Fun and gives good entertainment!,"We bought a bus to show us the place, the houses and everything and it was really exciting. But, the told us that they would make us go to Justin Bieber's House but he doesn't even live there.

40,A nice place to escape the rat race and hike,"The Hollywood Hills are surprisingly accessible, are free, and certainly seem safe.

If you like the outdoors to burn off some calories, the trails are well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robsT9648IO

30,Only saw it from a distance,"Just a normal part of the city, but of course for the rich. I saw it from the HoHo-bus, so from far away. Probably a lot more impressive if you walk through this neighbourhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyrtheStouwdam
50,Not for the squeamish,"I enjoyed a tour of the Hollywood Hills. However, Mulholland Dr. is a long, narrow and winding road, as are the other streets. There are no barriers and it seems like you might be going to drive off a cliff. Some of homes only have views of entry gates, and some of them are way, way off the road. But the drive is still worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindilou
40,Hollywood hills,Driving through the hills showcased many impeccable houses and breathtaking views. If you have some time definitely worth the trip to see the sights - there are some scenic stops from which you can see greater LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewaynep2016

50,Tour bus view,Went on a tour of the Hollywood Homes with an engaging NY driver and tour guide as part of our LA pass - LA city tours. We paid quite a bit for the pass so felt uncomfortable with the big sign asking for tips at the front of the bus as this was not in our budget.

40,"3-5 stars, depends on traffic","Really, the drive is nice, the homes are cool, very different CA feel, views are often great, BUT the traffic to get here, make the drive, and/or leave here can be HORRENDOUS.

50,A Beautiful Place to Live in or Visit,"The Hollywood Hills is one of the nicest neighborhoods to live in. It has a European feel almost like Cinque Terre, Italy without the views of the sea.A prime location close to many great things that Los Angeles has to offer. The only drawback is driving up and down those hills. Some of the homes are really off the beaten path which makes sense if you're a famous celebrity seeking seclusion.Great views from up top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdriannaA_12

40,One of those must do things!,"It's an area where money is everything. Not the home to the rich and famous that it once was, but you'd sure have to be rich to live her. Wonderful views and houses nestled into the hillsides. You didn't get to see much more than a gate for the most part, but well worth a couple of hours out your day. We took a tour which was pretty restrictive. If you have a rental car and a map of the area, I think you'd be better off - unfortunately we thought a tour would be full of inside information, but you could by maps telling you where stars used to live and where the remaining ones are these days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKerry53

I will have to return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaniemaria
50,A View from the Top,"The ride up is amazing with great city and canyon views of the famous Hollywood Hills. Keep your eye on the road and look out for the other guy while traveling up here.

50,Visiting a friend.,"It's a beautiful area with great views. Years ago, architects researched homes in Italy in order to design this area. It has classic appeal. Some homes are better maintained than others. If you live here, though, your neighborhood includes Hollywood Blvd, and if you have a dog, you'll be taking daily walks along inclines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermaidsylvia
20,Hollywood Tour and the Walk of Fame,"Wow, where to begin. #1 Don't go east past Highland as it is VERY sketchy. Early in the morning was very manageable but by 2pm, it was ""Filled"" with tourists. We took a tour of the Homes of the Star's in an open air van (*Most Likely Illegal""), as our driver broke every traffic law and did 3 U-turns at speed to avoid police. If you like to tool at large iron gates and ivy covered walls, then this is for you. We've check this off our bucket list and won't be going back. Shabby was the word most used about Hollywood on this day. Not recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GearyOutWest
50,Ride to see the sights,While visiting relatives we had a chance to see the variety of house styles from to extremely large. You get to see history past and present.

50,Hollywood Hills,Our tour guide was a very knowledgeable guy but I guess that is there job to be so they are up on all the latest and who lives where.

40,Enclave of the 1% of the 1%,"Interesting to drive through here, but you certainly can't stop and admire the view from up here very easily. Traffic now is unending. I don't know how the residents stand the congestion. Maybe the very rich can afford sound-deadening windows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
40,It will make you dizzy,Great way to spend an hour driving around in the hills. You can get your star map and spot celebrity homes. The downside is so many twists and turns you get car sick. Cool stopping points for amazing LA views.Definitely still recommend. Cheap fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripking07
40,An affluent and attractive area of LA,We drove up around here on our way to Griffith Observatory. The Hollywood Hills are part of the Santa Monica Mountains. You get great views up here of Burbank and Universal Studios and of LA itself. You get to drive around some of the notable residents houses but you won't see anything other than fences. I would want privacy if I was them too. The famous Hollywood Bowl is up here and the John Ford Theaters. It is a very pleasant drive through an affluent area of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96

50,Loved Getting Close Up To The Hollywood Sign,"While driving aroung this area one day I decided to follow my nose and try and get as close as I could to the Hollywood sign. My GPS wasn't much help as it took me miles up a road that eventually turned into a 'closed road' So finally with twists and turns I got as close to the sign that was legally possible. Do not try and climb the hill to get closer- there are security guards at the top, who have loud speakers if you dare try and try to warn you off and if you heed their warnings, the police helicopter will soon be deployed and come swooping overhead as it did the day we were there. There locals must get tired of the constant cruising of cars trying to negotiate their way around hairpin bends on what we call the wrong side of the road. But really, I don't think a local could expect anything less when you are living in the shadows of something so iconic in LA- in the world really. I couldn't tell you the street name to get you there because it was a complete blind adventure, but I had fun and got some awesome photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
30,The views gave us a perspective of the size of parts of LA,We took a tour up around the hills. Although we enjoyed being there (to say we've done it) it's really no different than other cities with houses on hills.

50,HOllywood is one great place to visit.,"If I told you I was tied up and left behind the letter H in the Heollywood Hills would you believe me? well I was. My fraternity did that to me and some others. we each had a letter.But the Hills themselves are outstanding and the homes are great to see. the view from the top looks oatut over LA and Hollywood itself.Yes, they do tours of the stars homes and it is a trip you should do once.they know the homes and you ,even with a map will not find most of the places.I loved living in Hollywood and going to schools here.Great places to see,shop,eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn680
40,cross your inger and hope to see a celeb,"We went on a tour to see the celebrity homes in the Hollywood Hills. I didn‚Äôt want to drive so we took the tour and was that a mistake. The bus driver whisked around so fast that we couldn‚Äôt see the homes and if we did, it was for just a few seconds. I took note of the route and drove by in my rental car and did the whole thing by ourselves. Don‚Äôt take a tour and just go yourself. It is a bit stressful but with a good copilot is is very doable and then you can get out and walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

Going down was fine then we realised we had to haul ourselves back up so, weaklings that we are, we went downwards for about 1 hour then dragged ourselves back up as we could not do the whole route.

50,Beautiful view,"This was one of the things I absolutely had to cross off my list before I left the LA area, and although I didn't expect a lot going in, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The drive up was a little more than we were used to, but parking was easy to find. The view was absolutely majestic, and it was nice just being away from it all and looking over the city. There's not a whole lot more to say, but if you are just visiting LA, stop by Hollywood and try this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415tylerm

50,Hollywood Hills Sparkle in the Early Morning Light,"On our first drive through the scenic Hollywood Hills, we had optimal views of downtown Los Angeles, Griffith Observatory and the breathtaking sunset. On our most recent visit, I discovered the beautiful views of the Hollywood Hills with the rays of the sunrise reflecting off the windows of the homes and mansions dotting the Hollywood Hills. This glimpse very early on this California morning kept me outside enjoying the unusual sparkle of glistening windows in the early light as the sun rose over the lush green Hollywood Hills. Beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
50,A great way to spend an afternoon,We passed through the hills on an earlier tour we had booked and wanted to go back.We spent the afternoon just driving round looking at all the houses. It's a lovely drive and the properties you see are simply breathtaking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckstrike13

Great views and great photo opportunities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
50,Great views and grand mansions,What a cool drive! This is a great way to spend some time driving though gorgeous scenery and viewing spectacular mansions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chiefly1
40,Great for a Sunday drive,"I'm an architect and the Hollywood Hills are excellent to see how the mid-level of the entertainment industry lives. Some of the houses are very dumpy and tired looking 60s affairs. Others are over the top and garish, while some are simply beautiful works of modern architecture. Since L.A. is so trend conscious, the current fads really come out in the styles of the houses. Unlike, say, Beverly Hills, where last decades design miscalculations are ripped away with another expensive remodel or teardown. Worth a look if you only walk up a few blocks from Sunset Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/x1achilles
50,Beautiful Homes and the Hollywood Sign,"We walked up to The Griffith Observatory and the view of the Hollywood Hill is stunning. Beautiful modernist and old homes, and The Hollywood Sign as a bonus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpusPenguin

40,Great views either way,"The Hollywood hills are win wins:if you are looking up from Hollywood then the iconic sign is there to see, and if you go up to the hills, you get to see the Los Angeles basin. Everyone's a winner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom131288
50,Great day of three different types of adventure!,The old and grand homes on the way up to the observatory are beautiful testaments to the glory of the time in which they were built and make for beautiful photos! One can spend an entire day in the Griffith Observatory exploring the wonders of the stars and space. The hiking beginning at the observatory offers spectacular views of the region and great people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnPage1966
40,Great drive,We drove through this neighborhood to get to the observatory. This place has really beautiful old mansions practically hanging off the mountain side. The greenery is fantastic as well worth a little drive around for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManiR986
50,Awesome!!!,"Took our own tour of this fascinating neighborhood of Hollywood Hills. It is amazing how this mansions are built on these cliffs. Stilts on the back side.We saw ElvisPresley's Mansion,Paul Newman's,Barbara Stanwick, Micky Rooney's, I think there is more but can't remember.Many years have passed but so enjoyed visiting here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dskeens
50,Pretty cool view,"Had a couple hours before flight from LAX back to Wisconsin. Drove up to the Hollywood Hills by the Griffith Observatory. View was amazing, seeing the sign was amazing. Only thing not good was the restrooms. We just got back from Mexico and the toilets were far superior in Mexico than in the Hills. Would have liked to stay longer but had to catch a plane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelflewellen
50,Hollywood Hills,"Amazing vistas from ""The Hills""...downtown Los Angeles views; the houses in the Hills seemingly ""hang"" from the ""cliffs"" they're built on. We toured the Hills and other popular places in LA with relatives involved in the movie and song, screen writing business.....an ""insiders"" take on the Hills.....Imagine streets narrow to the point that an emergency vehicle such as a fire truck cannot access some of the homes there because of the narrowness of the streets. Fires are dealt with there using helicopters....It's totally worth your time to check out the homes in ""The Hills""...you'll wonder how those homes were ""nailed"" to the sides of cliffs and other outcroppings...I understand it takes 45 minutes to drive down to the local market to grocery shop....trips are planned accordingly...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenS287
40,The Sign,We stayed with relatives who live in Los Felix and you can see the Hollywood sign when you walk around Griffith Park.Bottom line its a sign and we were in the right place to see it but I wouldn't drive specially to see it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazydays_8
50,Money is no object here,"This is a whole other world, we are talking 1 million pounds wouldnt get you far, but its a must see, its a whole different lifestyle, the homes are stunning and the cars are magnificant I was lucky enough to visit a mansion in the hills and it was out of this world, go take a look!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kai155
50,A Scenic Ride!,"I had the pleasure of being in the passenger seat and enjoying the sights along Mulholland Drive and the rest of the hills. Although hearing about all of the stars who live here is interesting, the beauty and calm of being in the Hills is unmatched. It is best to enjoy this sight as a PASSENGER! LOL...The roads are winding, the hills are steep, and a mis-judged turn could take you off a very steep cliff! Otherwise, a very beautiful place and a great place to imagine living the ""lifestyles of the rich and famous!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJackson50

40,A lovely drive,Me and my friends went for a drive around the Hollywood Hills - It has some incredible views and beautiful houses. Free to do and a bit of fun. Definitely worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB0022

50,Worth it the drive!,Hollywood hills are probably my favourite place to view the skyline of downtown la as well as the san fernando valley. Mulholland drive can not be missed !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealBusinessReview
50,Stay in the Hills!,"We opted to stay in the Hollywood Hills away from all of the hustle and bustle and I'm very glad we did. The Hills afford breathtaking views, access to nature, tranquility, easy access to Hollywood, mystery, glamour and not to mention affordability. We rented a home facing Mulholland Dr. with 180 degree canyon and city views. We also had a nice view of the Hollywood sign and were in short walking distance to Runyon Canyon. We thoroughly enjoyed the area and loved that we only had a 5 minute drive down to Hollywood Blvd. When I go back to LA I will definitely stay there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rengem
30,Good for a quick drive through,"It's impressive to us folks from back east to see houses built like this. The views are pretty and the houses can be impressive, as well. Our drive just took us for a quick spin through here and it was neat, but wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scranton38
40,Great place to drive,If you have extra time while in L.A. Take your car into the Hollywood hills the roads are very narrow but the views are spectacular and the homes run the gambit from small to spectacular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-retired
40,A must-see while in LA,"To get up into the Hollywood Hills we took Nichols Canyon Road and snaked upwards until we came to Mulholland Drive. There we encountered the tour buses so we knew we were on the right track. We went past houses both ostentatious and modest but most of the time the roads were so narrow and winding we weren't able to take photos. California was in the midst of a terrible drought so everything was parched. Much of the landscape was just stark bare hills dotted with chaparral. We saw some homes of the stars - beautiful places with multiple rooms, sprawling gardens and elegant pools. We came back down Mulholland Drive until we reached Laurel Canyon Road and then took West Sunset Boulevard heading towards the coast. We did a detour up Beverley Hills Drive until we could go no further and this and Bel Air were more what I'd always imagined the homes of the rich in LA were like. There were old trees shading roads, manicured hedges, ornate gates barring entry to obviously well-kept, multi-storey houses. The dwellings are in all types of architecture. We saw plenty of Spanish- and German-style houses, and then also some weird modern designs. If you're going to LA a trip into the hills is a must-see in my book.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295kathys
10,The Hollywood Hills is a residential neighborhood...,That hates tourist driving through it. So much so that they call the police when people park on there street. Tickets are given. You have been warned.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyTobey
40,Nice Scenic Drive,We enjoyed driving through the hills. The views were spectacular and the homes were impressive. You need to be very careful as the streets are narrow and sometimes there are blind corners. This is a high traffic area so slow down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjwright
40,Excellent Views if the Weather is Good,"This is an interesting area and well worth a visit if you are in the area and have a car, as the hills are steep and there is a lot of area to cover. The view on a clear (NON Smog) Day are fantastic and at night even better. You can see some pretty amazing homes in this area and not all of them are owned by Movie Stars as a mater of fact very few are. During certain area you can see how really big the Hollywood sign is. THIS IS A SELF DRIVE/WALK tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch
50,Hollywood Hills Hike!,"We desided to walk all the way from Beachwood Dr, up the hills to get as close to the sign as possible. There are some steep hills so you should where some comtable shoes. We made it up to the Senic View point at Lake Hollywood Park. The view was amazing. It was cool to se all the houses to normal peope that lives in the Hollywood Hills, not only the rich and famous. We did stumble over the formal house of Madonna, and Asthon Kutchers house, that was cool. We did walk down to the Hollywood Reservoir the walk all the way around. It was a bit longer then we expected so bring a small backpack with water and some snacks!! We finally made it down to the Hollywood Blvd. My girlfriend almost fainted becouse of the heat and the lack of wather, so water is very important.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299thomasj
40,Views were breathtaking.,"Loved the views although I am afraid of heights. It was amazing how the houses sit in the hills, I couldn't live there but it was nice. The drive up was terrifying, the people drive like maniacs and so did the tour bus driver.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178LM
30,Great views.,"Great views, however the roads are extremely narrow and winding, you almost feel as if you are intruding on the residents and it can be difficult if another car is coming in the opposite direction. Great to see and worth the time, definitely wouldn't attempt if your a nervous driver not experienced with driving on the opposite side of the road in that instance it would be better to take the tour bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newbag
40,Nice to try at least once,"Amazing views and scenery, but the locals drive recklessly on the slim roads that allow only one car to drive through w the steep hills and sharp curves you can't see whats coming at you ahead. Make sure you have full coverage car insurance and health insurance as well travelling through the Hollywood Hills. My family traveled through this area for a view of the Hollywood sign. It was nice to drive through the area at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liveinthemomentnow
50,Nice view,Good to get away from the city and get some rest and have a nice view of both the Los Angeles city and Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Araz-ali
40,Lots to see but you must be a brave driver.,"Pick up a map of ""stars"" homes and get started. You'll probably find a few dead ends and steep hills, but it's worth the effort. Take the road up to Mullholland Drive -- the views are amazing. A GPS is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanYHZ
40,"Great View, terrible roads","If you do visit LA, you're gonna wanna take a drive up there.The houses are stunning as you would expect, the view is amazing and we actually had to go twice because there so many small roads that it's hard to remember where you have already been and where you haven't.The thing that bothered me was the condition of the roads, with loose asphalt and a lot of pot holes. but then again, the drive is definitely worth the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormTRG
30,"Big pretty houses, that's all folks","If you're into living vicariously through the rich and famous, you might really get off on this. Otherwise, you will find the experience pretty boring and quickly realise you are just looking at a bunch of garage doors. There are views out over Los Angeles occasionally which are nice, but nothing to write home about due to the smog.I would recommend finding a list of famous people's addresses online (or buying in LA) and conducting your own tour if you have a car. Alternatively, you can do tours but they are pretty expensive for what you get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmO6405MS
40,Nice Experience,Nice view of the city from the hills and took a picture with the Hollywood sign. Nothing much to do around head back to the city for action,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nirmal75
40,Take a drive,"Take a drive through the Hollywood Hills and see beautiful homes, and even some innovative architecture. Amazingly, most of these gorgeous residences seem unoccupied, except for gardeners! If I could own a home like that I would be in it all the time. Some houses are hard to see and it's best driven in a vehicle high off the ground. Wonderful views, trees, shrubs and flowers. It's like living in a park - but why does no one seem to be living and enjoying it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewA962
30,what a let down,Hollywood we said we must go there. Ok we went there but what a total let down. It was nothing awe imagine huge villas yes. All within their high fences. We the hollywoodcsign from behind. All my romanticized ideas of the glam and glitter dashed . I wouldn't waste time going there again. L.A. has so much more to offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sniknej187437
50,Bucket List Item- Crossed Off!,"This has been on my bucket list for quite some time. I was able to cross it off this past 4th of July. The area feels like you're in the movie ""Pleasantville."" Perfectly manicured lawns, gorgeous houses, nice cars in the driveway. My friends and I did get lost trying to find the way to the hills. We could see the sign, but it was not easy getting to it like we had thought. We ended up venturing through this Pleasantville neighborhood (which was exciting to walk through so the time flew by).Me and my girlfriends aren't the most athletically inclined, but we were able to walk up the hill with no problem. As you can see by my picture, the sign is extremely teeny unless you are able to get up very close (which will be a LOT of walking/climbing).My recommendation: Climb the hills before sunrise or after sunset. Will be a lot cooler. And bring lots of water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDiary
40,"Bob Seger said it best ""..high rolling hills """,We did the Mulholland Drive rride from the vicinity of the Hollywood Bowl over to Laurel Canyon .The ride was very enjoyable .The scenery is vantastic .We had previously taken a tour which had identified some celeb houses .It was nice to drive at a slow pace and enjoy the views .Highly recommend taking the drive .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
30,Glad we went for a look,"We used the dog walking site zip code and took a nice drive through the hills early one Sunday morning before leaving LA. You can tell the residents are sick of it with all the signs. We stopped off to take a photo once we reached the dog walk area, there are some rocks that you can stand on and create a photo like you are holding the Hollywood sign, across the road I'm sure on a clear day the views over the city would be spectacular (it was cloudy while we were there). Nothing much around there as you would expect like a toilet so on the way down we stopped off at a Starbucks for a break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kel1042
50,Really good,"For whoever likes hiking, this is one the the trails that you will end up doing sooner or later. It is not the hardest or prettiest trail you'll ever do, but it will take you to have a closer view of the world famous Hollywood sign and a wider view of the Los Angeles city (hopefully, if the smog permits).When I did the trail I came back through an almost lost small out of the map trail. It made my hike even more fun. However, it can be a little dangerous due to a few steep ways. Anyway, just being closer to the nature, sunshine and sand, for whoever likes it, should be good enough to give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FelipeC765
40,A nice drive,"Definitely take a drive up the Hollywood Hills. You can get close to the Hollywood sign to take a pic, see star homes and see Mulholland Drive. No lights at night so go during the day. It has breathtaking views of the Valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjsanchez
40,Winding Roads to the Famous Hollywood Sign,I was surprised that so many nice homes are lining the streets that are so narrow with so many curves. I guess that is part of the history as these roads and many homes must be pretty old. Eventually you'll get to some really nice viewing areas of the sign. You'll never really get that close but a good place to park is just path the dog park. Of course with a good camera you do not need to drive into the hills to get a great picture. The sign is visible from many locations around the area. A good spot for viewing the sign is in Griffith Park at the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtomicReviewer
20,They don't like tourist.,"Don't try to go to the sign. It looks better from a distance anyway. the local are fed up with tourist and will sick they're gardener on you, Nothing really to see. all the houses are blocked from view and you can't ever see anyone. easy to get lost. waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandlisaK
50,H Hills,Surely worth seeing.. not much there.. just loads of hills and this one famous sign.. but still i loved it.. just the fact of being there and seeing it myself.. and a beautiful houses all around.. just not really understand why people would want to live there.. surely it would not be my choice if I would be rich... ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danek_6
40,DO THE HOLLYWOOD STAIRS WALK,"I've been to LA many times and have never done this before. You go to the Hollywood hills area, and there is a tall elevator, and you walk within these tiny narrow alleys of beautiful houses. looks like some European village",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amrtravel11
40,Beautiful homes and historic views,"You could get lost, but this is the original living in the hills neighborhood. Not the big Beverly Hills mansions, but alot of movie business pioneers lived here during the twenties and thirties. Strangely cozy and quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benjamins427
30,Iconic,"We put the following address in our GPS and it led us up through the hills to a spot where there is a marked shoulder and several vehicles, including tour buses pulled over to the side for people to get out and take pictures:3204 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles, CaScenic and one of those things you have to do when going to Hollywood, but I personally could have skipped this stop. There are more interesting things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineCritic
40,Hollywood Hills Classic,"Don't get lost, but definitely go for a drive through the hills all the way to the top. Where a lot of the stars live, and where a lot of the craziest times in LA have happened. Oh and stop by the Canyon Country Store in the middle of Laurel Canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
50,Live there,Well this is a easy one because I grew up in the Hollywood Hills. It covers quite a lot of ground. You have every kind of house you can imagine in the hills. Beautiful ones overlooking the whole city and then there are houses on stilts. Also some look over and can see the ocean. It was fun being in the hills growing up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddyone1

50,An experience I'll never forget,Drove up into the hills to check out the views.We found a small rubble area to park on and took some beautiful pics of LA and the Hollywood sign.Also a nice place to view property in the area and fantasise about living with such an amazing view every day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laura_Rose25
40,Glamour Views,"Always a great place for a look at the vast San Fernando Valley. If it's not too hot, it's a great place to pull over to the side and relax for a few minutes. Though you could bike or jog/walk around. I have always passed both types.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junnyd2018
50,Interesting drive,"If you ever want to see 'how the other people live"" it is an interesting drive. The streets are windy and some are steep. Fantastic homes when you can see them as many are behind walls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnInnVT

50,Amazing Hollywood,"The views from the Hollywood Hills of the Los Angeles basin and to the ocean are one of the best features of the Hills. At night, they are spectacular. There are lots of gorgeous homes in the area, too, many of which have been and still are inhabited by famous movie stars. And you can't forget the Hollywood sign that is so iconic to Los Angeles. I am a native and while I don't live there, on a clear day I can see all the way to that sign from my upstairs bedroom and smile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSW842
40,Beautiful to look at,"It is idyllic, especially at dusk. But you almost have to be back from it a bit, because when you are in it, there is luch canopy of trees obscuring most of the view around you. And in places, the roads are very, very narrow in some areas, with not many places to stop or park along some of the streets. But there are moments when it seems like something out of a fantasy book, looking at these homes clinging to hillsides, with modern lighting that gives everything a surrealistic appearance. Note: There are no stores, or shops, or other attractions to visit... these are private residences in charming neighhborhoods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphK507
50,Good for window-shopping,"There's really not much to ""do"" in Hollywood Hills. My recommendation is to just hop in your car and take off up the winding hills. The houses and the views are unforgettable -- and the only thing you have to pay for to look is the gas. A cheap and memorably ""LA"" thing to see if you're visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596aarong
40,Beautiful views and you might see a star,My first trip to LA on my own I bought a map of the stars homes and went and stood outside Raquel Welch's house. It is a weird feeling to think back on that. I was 16 at the time. What can I say?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finnagain57
40,funky neighborhood,"It is fun to drive around the switchback streets meandering through the Hollywood Hills. In a few places there are empty lots so you can see the views. You may see a celebrity, they live here and shop at Beachwood Canyon grocery store",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carry_0n_traveler

30,Easy to get to; boring to see!,"Yes, there were some very nice pieces of archtecture to see, including one home that was decorated with definitely middle-eastern exterior trimmings, including colorful life-size statues, all sorts of 'gee-gaws,' and outlandishly decorated trimmings! I had NEVER seen anything like this ANYWHERE in the U.S. before!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
40,Nice if clear,"On a clear day, the Hollywoid Hills give views of city all the way to the ocean. Its seems as if everytime I go, the smog pollution is worse and worse. I guess the price you have to pay to live with millions of others who want sunshine and beaches. Bad if you like to breathe and the news is saying stay indoors because smog is so bad. I like to visit only!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
