50,"Beautiful and historic place, wonderful docents","Beautiful house. The history of this place has been well documented here, so I just want to say I took the house tour last weekend and really enjoyed it. The staff couldn't be friendlier, and $7 is a great deal for a tour. I actually think they should charge more to cover outdoor repairs and restoration that needs to be done.You actually need not pay for parking if you are willing to do a little walking. There is free parking on PCH or on Civic Center Way on the north side of Legacy Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marierm
20,Nothing Special,"If you are into interior design, you might find this interesting. Other than that, I feel like this is a rip off because you have to pay 7$ for the house tour which is actually boooring. And the lady that led the tour was so unaccommodating. Geez! Just take a picture outside because they wont allow you to take pictures inside the house. No wonder theres not a lot of picture out there. Oh well, please be nice to guests especially when they are paying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dslss
50,Must see! Amazing home & history of first settlers of Malibu!,You MUST SEE the Adamson House! The docent led tour is so interesting and informative. This historic 1925 home is a treasure. Designed in a Gothic style with original Malibu tile work that is absolutely gorgeous! The history of the original Malibu family and their legacy is fascinating.

It is located right on the sand in the heart of Malibu with an incredible view, and in walking distance of the Malibu pier.

50,Adamson House and Gardens,Interesting bit of Malibu history. We did the house tour. Beautiful tile work. Interesting architecture. Furniture and furnishings are original from when the family lived there (including clothes in the closets). Gorgeous ocean view from second floor balcony.

50,An impromptu tour of the Adomson House,"We stopped by to view this fabulous historic gem during our Californian driving holiday , unfortunately it was closed on that Monday and we had only one chance to see it. We bumped into the curator Damien (hope I’ve spent it right) a very friendly Irishman who opened up and gave us a tour of the house. He was so knowledgeable and friendly we thoroughly enjoyed this private out of hours tour and would like to thank Damien. He made it a very special experience and we’ll remember it for a very long time.Go raibh milé maith agat Damien!Gordon and Suzanne WoodEdinburgh",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneW1846

50,A Part of History for California,"This house is built on the area of the Malibu Lagoon where many surfers love to surf because of the way the waves follow the current. The house is where the Adamson family lived for many years and they were the manufacturers of our Spanish Tile so beautiful all over Southern California.The Docents are knowledgeable and take you on an hour tour of the house and some of the grounds. Parking is next to the house and it cost a minimum of $6.00 but it is well worth it. The State of California takes care of the house and grounds and so there is a fee of about $12.00 to see the house but it is well worth it. The house is now used for weddings and special parties. The architecture is Spanish/Moorish and right now in the Spring, all the flowers are in bloom. You can take a walk around the Lagoon when you are done with the house and there are many restaurants in the vicinity for a nice lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIB1128
50,Beautiful historic home,This “home” is full of great inspiration if you’re looking to build your own home. Hand painted tile work all throughout the property. It’s one of the founding families of Malibu. Pay for the tour—it’s worth it. The tour guides work with you if you have young kids... we brought our 2yr old. They were very flexible and kept the tour moving along while being very sweet to all the kids in our group (total of 4 under 6). They also gave a great history of the house and its previous owners. Loved it so much that I will be going back soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeeTimeWie
50,Excellent Tour of a Gorgeous Hidden Gem,"I've seen pictures of this place and always wanted to visit since it looked absolutely beautiful. Now that I have visited, it might be the most gorgeous historic house I've toured in person and that's saying a lot having been to the Gamble House and Hollyhock House in the past. The house is so full of colorful painted tiles inside and out that it's said to be the ""Taj Mahal of Tile,"" the effect is dazzling when walking around the property and seeing these lovely designs.I forgot the name of the tour guide but I enjoyed everything she had to say and she was very enthusiastic about the property which made the comprehensive tour all the better. There is also a small gift shop that had some great items to choose from; I got two mini painted tiles for $8 a piece. All the proceeds from buying tickets and gift shop items goes towards preserving this landmark, so it's money well spent.There's a parking lot immediately to the left of the main entrance that's used for the beach, you can go there to park for the house as well. Be sure to bring cash or check for the tour tickets since they don't take credit cards. It's an incredibly underrated and beautiful hidden gem that I highly recommend people visit for themselves!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014

50,Adamson - Fabulous Malibu Tile House,"My wife and I decided to take an excursion on Saturday to visit the Adamson Historic home. Parking is available at a cost of $8 dollar and located right outside of the walled mansion. Guided tours would be recommended or you can take a self-guided tour if you are familiar with the history.This home over 100 years old is a real treasure as you will find that the Adamson's were not only the founders of the much revered ""Malibu Tile"" but you will find unique home innovations promoted by this wealthy family. This is a very unique experience discovering that the Adamson House is host to the largest collection of Malibu Tile.The pottery factory built in the mid 1920s lasted a few years and burnt down in 1932. The original malibu tile was in limited production and samples, its formulas went down with the fire. Unbeknownst to me, the Adamson's were also the founders of the Adohr Milk Company in honor of wife Rhoda's who's name is spelled backwards.Tour last about 1 1/2 hour and for fee of $7, it is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arturofranz
40,Fascinating! Stunning!,"We were utterly beguiled by the fabulous Adamson House, the Malibu history and family stories, the grounds and the view, but most of all the extraordinary tilework and ironwork decor of the home. Our docent was knowledgeable and very responsive to the various interests and levels of expertise of the group and very good at pointing out the details and explaining what they meant about the culture and era. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cranberries0928

50,Great views and history of Malibu and Southern California,"Thank goodness everything in Malibu hasn't been torn down for the latest billionaire or movie star's house. This is a great slice of Malibu - and California - history and maybe the best place to see Malibu tile in all of it's glory. Definitely take a tour and go inside and see the house and amazing tile. Originally, this was a showcase for the Malibu Tile factory which was just down the beach. The site also has a small museum, which basically is a mini history of California - from the original native americans to today's residents at the movie colony across the lagoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenpasadena
50,Historic Malibu Estate,"Nestled in the dunes, where the Malibu River meets the Pacific is a jaw-dropping antique estate in pristine condition. It contains the finest in-place collection of custom handmade Malibu Pottery tile I've ever seen. The excellent 1-hour docent-led tour covers Malibu land grants, tile craft, California family-ties, and of course, a tour that you'll not soon forget. Be sure to relish views from every window (not kidding), and savor the flocks of birds sheltering in the boathouse estuary (so unusual). Except for running the grounds, it's a site best suited for older children to adult. Limited handicapped accessibility to the upstairs level. The grounds would make an excellent venue for small-medium-sized private parties. Paid parking lot by Pacific Coast Highway. The property is a short walk away towards the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVanBFayetteville_NC
40,Lovely bit of Malibu history,"If you're in Malibu by all means make this one of your stops. It represents Malibu's original history (after the native Chumash), designed by Julia Morgan (Hearst Castle architect) and located on Malibu's most beautifl location. Constructed on a 3' thick concrete slab foundation to resist earth movement and earthquakes, it also includes much of Malibu Tile's original designs (also owned by the Rindge family). Known as the Adamson House, Adamson was the caretaker who married the daughter of the founding Rindge family, the tour and grounds are elegant in as simplistic, non-ostentatious way. Worth a visit even if the tour is not available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,No regrets!,"Wow! This is a beautiful historical house in great repair. The Malibu Potteries tile and other furnishings are remarkable. The history associated with this house and property are interesting, too.Plan ahead as parking can be a real challenge, especially if you are not used to high population density. Parking will most likely require cash. Admission fee is $7 a person (well worth it) and only cash and check are permitted. Photography is not permitted inside the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maileann
40,Delightful museum smack in the middle of Surf Rider Beach,"Always nice to learn a little history about the site visited. The museum is located smack in the middle of the Surf Rider Beach. Quite an unusually landscape. The history of this house, the owners, and the city of Malibu makes for a wonderful story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80ricks80
50,Terrific Sojourn into Malibu History,"We really enjoyed the tour of this grand, historic property from the 1930s. Robert, our docent guide, was a font of knowledge of the era and showed us the entire house and told us the stories of the very wealthy family that lived here. This is a fantastic location with spectacular views of the ocean and lagoon. They allow drop offs of handicapped people right in front of their garage doors. As you exit PCH, the lagoon parking lot is the general parking area and is just off to the left. On Friday, the day we went, handicapped parking was free. Normally, it's $8 a car. That's great. If you love history and the beach, you will love this place. Plan on staying close to two hours. Remember, the hours are limited to only a few days during the week and only certain hours. You must be accompanied by a docent to go inside the house. Undoubtedly worth the $7 entrance fee. I plan on going again with others who haven't seen it. Congratulations, Robert and the other docents, on volunteering your time and sharing your knowledge about this place. Go--you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vatonorteno

40,"Go if you like History, Architecture or Ceramics","If you like tiles, or architecture, or want to get away from the overt displays of wealth in the Malibu area, the Adamson house is a good bet.You can only get in to the Adamson House as part of a docent tour which is a slight negative as it means that the time, duration and pace of your visit are not fully in your own control. Our lovely docent was knowledgeable and I was happy to hear all her stories but my companion felt the tour went on too long. Others in our group cut out before the tour ended as they had an event to get to and this particular docent was in a talkative frame of mind on the day.Photography is not permitted in the house. The reasons weren't explained and this is surprising given that photography is hardly going to damage tiles (which are everywhere.)Parking in the area is scarce and mostly paid. I'd recommend planning a morning visit to make parking easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelbourneKaz
50,Gorgeous house full of history,We took the first tour at 11 AM ($7/person). The docent was very knowledgeable and engaging. She pointed out very interesting design elements and stories.

50,Tile tile tile,I take everyone visiting to LA to this. It is the original house of the Malibu ranch and right on the beach by the lagoon. The owner started the Malibu tile company in the 1930s that specialized in California Spanish revival tile. The house is tile everywhere and an original. Worth the $5 for unique history. Be sure to check the calendar for when open.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6094HFjank
50,Beautiful setting,"I visited at a time when the house was not open. LA doesn't have rain very often, but if it has been rainy at all, the house will be closed due to the mud. Be sure to call ahead because they can close the park a bit early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobynY_12

My wife and I are very interested in Malibu, Spanish and Catalina tile because we own a 1930's Spanish style home.Even without access to the inside of the house, the property is beautiful and has placards along the path explaining things about the area and the property. The examples of Malibu tile around the exterior of the house are well worth the visit if that type of thing interests you.The property is also near Surfrider's beach and the pier. We parked on the street and then walked over to the pier after touring the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4404CXchrist
50,Quintessential point of Malibu history,"The Adamson House offers a unique view into the historical past of Malibu. It not only educates but is a direct window into the pioneering spirit required to first fall in love with, then affect and protect through wisdom, forethought, and action the place one calls home.Beautiful grounds where you can picnic within feet of this gorgeous stretch of beach. Or after a sweet tour of this remarkable home you can stay parked and walk to the historical Malibu Pier which was actually built by the woman who owned the Adamson House. There are two fabulous restaurants on the pier that offer locally grown and sourced food.Whatever your choice you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422sh
50,Return on A Beautiful Day and Fabulous Tour!,My friend and I returned signed up for the tour and it was two hours of total immersion into getting history and family of this incredible place. Probably because we only had 7 of us and we were all curious asking loads of questions our docent spent the extra half hour and what joy. The interior and history of both the home and pool house so incredibly beautiful and functional for a 1930s build. Don't miss this place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiebr63

50,Amazing display of Malibu tile,"We heard about the Adamson House at a lecture we attended about California tile makers. We fought through the traffic on a Saturday and paid the house a visit. Our docent was excellent. He really knew the house and its history. I'm to sure I've ever seen a house with such an extensive installation of tile. The house is in a beautiful setting on the beach. Through the tour we learned a lot about the history of Malibu and the part the Ringe family played in that history.Note that parking is impossible. We tried the lot next to the house and also at the state beach. We lucked into a spot on PCH.I highly recommend this tour, and we plan to go again, but not on a summer a Saturday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/So_Cal_Illini_81
40,Important Piece of Malibu History,"The Adamson House is a must-see attraction when visiting Malibu. It is filled with exquisite tile from the 1930s and gives a glimpse back in time, focusing on the history of the founding Malibu family. It is as if the owners just walked off and left the home, with all furnishings left in place. Unfortunately, the house is beginning to show its age, and visiting hours are not the most convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanandjack2015

50,Little-known Gem in Malibu,"This is the coolest quintessential SoCal beach house ever! In Malibu, adjacent to the bird sanctuary, and not far from Malibu pier. It has myriad examples of California tile throughout, including tile 'Oriental Rugs' and beautiful wall decorations and fireplaces. Many interesting architectural details throughout the house, lovely grounds and as well as a salt water pool with a view of the sand and Malibu surfers. It was built in 1929 by an old California family, which ran Adohr Farms Dairy for many years. Fascinating and beautiful, and when you're done, have a nice walk through the sanctuary and to the beach.

50,"So good, this is a must see for locals and tourists","I finally visited after all these years. Great history of the house and Rindge-Adamson family.It's a national historic site as well as California historic monument.If visiting Malibu, the Adamson House is worth a visit. You've seen our beaches, eaten at our restaurants, now get some of our history.Lots of political infighting between docents (volunteer guides) and management. Hope that improves soon. Worthwhile to visit. Learn and support our history.Tours are $7 (cash only) and strangely limited to Friday-Saturday.There's a small gift shop with the usual trinkets. However, I did find two Malibu history books that I don't have.Yes yes yes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
30,"Overrated, but worth a visit if you're already here","People spoke so enthusiastically about this house that I was a little taken aback when I saw how small the grounds and gardens are.I was also very surprised that a state park and national historic landmark would end its tours at 2 o'clock on a Saturday. I arrived at 2:30, so missed the tour and interior of the house. I did peek in the windows, and it certainly looked nice, but no doubt it's the tour that really makes it interesting.The gardens seem to consist primarily of a large, bare upper lawn, and a lower lawn with a decorative concrete bench in the center of a long wall. At the base of this wall are flower beds, but this whole area was chained off when I got there. The lower lawn also has shade from some nice, old trees, but with the chains, it wasn't possible to enjoy it.The view, of the lagoon and beach, is beautiful, as it is all along this coast.Traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway is stressful all the way from Santa Monica through Malibu. I actually passed the Adamson House, had lunch in the nice shopping mall up the road, and came back down on the south-bound side where the house is. The driveway was blocked, but I was lucky, and someone pulled out of a parking space along the road not far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catemaco

We spent roughly two hours here walking and playing with sticks, looking at flowers, observing squarrels. It's rather small but the gardens are so peaceful and beautiful, with multiple benches to seat on. They just added real toilets to replace portable ( yess!) . the place is facing the ocean, I saw multiple weddings taking place here at times. No cafe but there is a picknick table :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veronika8000
50,"Great for anyone, a MUST visit for honeymooners!","Most Angelenos have no idea that this hidden gem even exists. You can check out the website, but there is nothing like taking the guided tour of the home and gardens, and hearing the amazing story behind the house and its history. Since it began as a honeymoon cottage, I think honeymooners will love to imagine this as their first home! To me, Touring the rooms, I could imagine myself being a guest of the family many years ago. This is a truly world-class location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb

I have done Mother's Day and Christmas tours - each was different and well worth the time. Learn about the families connections to various important LA movers and shakers of their day, as well as battles over land, development of Malibu Tile company and architecture.

The house does not have parking of their own, but there is parking offered by then city $8. You can also park on the curve for free, but make sure you park on the ocean side as there are no crosswalks and traffic there is fast. The home charges $7 adults and $2 children. They have staff lead tours. The home is unique. We have visited 30+ historical home in southern California and this one has as all others their unique character and special history.

50,A compact history of Malibu in a spectacular home and grounds,"Historic house built by a wealthy eastern family who fell in love with the spectacular coast line and nearly virgin land of this coast in the first half of the 20th Century. After buying up much of the coastal land which is now Malibu and Malibu Colony, the Adamsons were instrumental in keeping Malibu relatively undeveloped. They single-handedly blocked the railroads and highways and the overdevelopment they would have brought. They founded the famous Malibu Colony where movie people built beach houses on the other side of the Malibu Lagoon. Compared to LA, Malibu is still fairly rural and beautiful. The Adamson House gives a glimpse into the amazing quality of life that used to be enjoyed here. Learning the story of this family is just one attraction. The Malibu Tiles that cover every room are a delight to behold. The family founded the tile works that supplied the incredibly beautiful and intricate tiles. The grounds are stunning. The admission to the grounds is free; a docent's guided tour of the house costs $7 for seniors. A very enjoyable afternoon we spent here after eating breakfast at Malibu Farm on the pier next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12

40,Hidden Architectural Gem,"You can miss the sign on the PCH, so Google it. You get a history lesson and an art lesson about glazed tiles while listening to the docent of the Adamson family home on the Malibu shore! Beautiful landscaping and a view of a particularly serene Pacific Ocean are unexpected extras. We had a cranky docent who had a bit of an attitude, so if you get her… just enjoy the surroundings. It was still worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoneAgain02
40,Learn the history of Malibu,"Spent a lovely day just wandering around before my guided tour by one of the local residents. They are very proud of this landmark that is now a state park.

The house is beautiful and the pottery tiles beautifully display the work done at Malibu pottery before its demise. You won't be disappointed by the architecture, landscaping and the breathtaking views.

50,A Hidden Gem in Malibu...Extraordinary Beauty,This home is a wonderful find. It is a place very rich in early Malibu history and it is full of amazing tile and fantastic views. Tile is throughout the home and in one hallway the tile is so intricate it looks like a rug on the floor. If you love historic homes this is one of the best I have been to. The tour starts out with 15-20 minutes of history to set the stage for the tour of the home. The guides are volunteers who love to ber there with visitors. I believe the cost is $10 - $15 and parking is on the PCH or in the beach lot adjacent to the property. You pay at the pay station and put the ticket in your window. If you can park on the PCH it is free parking but busy there. You may drive past it as it is secluded so get some detailed directions. Very near the Malibu Pier. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrtravel
50,Unusual Historic House,The most unusual thing about this house is the extensive use of tiles throughout the home. The original residents owned the Malibu Tile Company and used the tiles lavishly throughout this remarkable Spanish Colonial style house. I had never seen tiles designed to look like intricate carpets on the floor. The nine bathrooms also provide lavish and detailed tile designs. The home looks out over the beautiful Malibu Coast and sits right above Surfriders Beach which can easily have 100 surfers bouncing the waves. The docent Dana was extremely well informed and gave a thorough tour. Cost of tour is $7 (no senior discounts). Parking will cost you $8 on the weekend if you are unable to secure a place on the Pacific Coast Highway. The home also overlooks the Malibu Pier which was once an active boating port and railroad drop. It is also a possible wedding venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristieC665

50,"Gem,","I have lived in Los Angeles my entire life and been to Malibu every summer, yet somehow I had missed Adamson House. It first appeared on my radar a few years ago and I have been wanting to go every since. What a beautiful day we had visiting on a warm, clear day in January. The beautiful grounds and house overlook the ocean, with the waves breaking at the foot of the manicured lawns - fantastic! The house itself is a work of art, each detail well planned and expertly executed for that era. The tile is really a work of art. The bathrooms off each room are amazing in their use of tile, each one a unique experience. I loved the use of wrought iron throughout the house for lighting and window treatments - exquisite!I thoroughly enjoyed a relaxing day touring this historic house and its grounds. We were lucky enough to find convenient (and free) street parking on the Pacific Coast Highway, just a very short walk from the front entrance. The entrance fee was $7 per person for an hour long docent led tour, well worth it for the history and details you would miss otherwise. After the tour we took the short walk to the Malibu Pier and had lunch at Malibu Farm Restaurant - delicious! A wonderful end to a wonderful afternoon, overlooking the ocean on a beautiful day. What could be better?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kapro

Today the home has all the original furnishings complete with clothes in the closet.

Owned by the State Parks Service, it is a snapshot of Malibu history with its authentic Malibu tiles, stunning grounds, breathtaking vistas and the one of a kind Spanish revival home. Every room in the house has been lovingly preserved and every room has a different style and different tile. There's even a Persian Rug carpet that's made entirely of Malibu Potteries Tile including the fringe. Admire views of the Pacific while you stand before the unique starfish fountain. Browse the Lagoon Museum and find out all about Malibu's fascinating history. Hurry before the real Malibu gets squeezed out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmalibu

50,Tiles to die for!,"What a magnificent expression of interior design using thousands of tiles in every possible color and pattern. Much of it is Moorish, but also Spanish and Mexican influences. The house has a few stairs, not too much for slow climbers, and the views of the bay and surrounding area are worth it. It over-looks Surfriders Beach and there is a historic museum attached. In 10 days of visits to historic homes and adobes, it tops the list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellep844

The story of the Adamson house is interesting and the décor and view spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinklady007
50,A real gem,"It is easy to miss this treasure driving along the Pacific Coastal Highway through Malibu. But if you only have time to look at the grounds, it's definitely worth it. The home of one of the original local families, their story has been outlined by plaques around the grounds and outside of the house - and includes example of the long-gone Malibu Pottery business. We didn't get the chance to take the house tour but it was clear from peering through the windows that it was a glimpse into high style 1930's living.

50,An out-of-the-way wonder,"Slightly off the beaten path, the Adamson House is for those who live in the area, or those who love art and are looking for something else to see. It's not your typical museum...it's a historic home, built in the late 1920's and owned by the daughter of the original Malibu landowners. Especially nice are the many tiles used in decorating the home as the family owned a tile company nearby.Don't expect a mansion, but do expect a home where a family lived, with furnishings either authentic to the home or of the period. The home is on the water, near the pier, and the views are absolutely breathtaking. Lots of history of the area given on the tour and admission fee of $7 is very reasonable, including a tour of the inside as well as the garden. Additional fee is parking, which is $6. Nice little gift shop with tile souvenirs. Very nice way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCfoodie92648
50,HIstory of Malibu and Beautiful Ceramic Tiles in one place.,"This is a chance to relive an important part of malibu and Southern California history. The Adamson house is hidden behind it's original stone wall next to the pier. Walk through the gates and you are carried back to the 1930's when this beautiful Spanish Colonial House and splendid gardens were in their heydays. Situated on 13 acres next to Surfrider Beach and the Malibu Lagoon, this place is something to behold.One can walk the grounds and visit the museum for free. However, the real treat is to take a tour of the inside of the house for a modest charge. It was home to Rhoda and Merritt Adamson and their three children. Rhoda was the Daughter of Frederick and May Rindge, who were the last major owners of the 17,000 acre Rancho Malibu.In 1928 Rhoda's mom, May opened the Malibu Pottery on the beach, 1/4 mile from the pier. The Pottery made some of the most exquisite tile in the country. These tiles made their way to many significant buildings including the Adamson House. In fact, it is because of the abundance of this beautiful tile found in the house that it was put on the US Historic Register. When you tour the house you get a chance to see all of this.The tours are small groups of visitors led by knowledgeable volunteer docents, who really enjoy their work. The house contains about 95% of the original furniture. It is also full of the original linens, china, books, games, musical instruments, family clothing, etc. You really get a feel for how the family lived.This is one of those hidden gems that should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunset1001

50,Free fun in Malibu,"Take a drive along PCH towards Malibu and find yourself here! There is no fee for entry (though there is a beach parking fee), but with the manicured grounds and historic home - not mention the close proximity to the lagoon, I'm surprised that there isn't. This is a great location for photos of nature and the occasional posed family/individual picture. (Note: check before you go if professional photography is allowed; most places have fees). This is a beautiful place to unwind & reconnect with nature!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mystica33

The Adamson House is one of the most beautiful places to have a wedding. The tree the outside where the cermony was held made this cermony feel cosy, yet classy and elegant. Sounds different but I'm not a surfer nor is my husband but the feel with the surfers in distance was beautiful. Thee area for the coctail hour prior to the reception was perfect. Food and staff were top notch but I'm not sure if they are part of the Adamson House.. I was just a guest and second to my own wedding, it was the best wedding I can remember attending. The Adamson House is where I would consider if I was getting married today....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShelleyR82

This was our second attempt to tour the home, because on our last trip out to California, it was raining, and they don't opperate during those days, because of the damage to house due to tracking in mud. I won't tell all of the details of the house, so you can discover it for yourself. It really is a ""must see"", my husband is fourth generation Californian and this is one of those places for Californians to take pride in. A true working family's home, and the extensive use of authentic Malibu tile is beautiful. Available for weddings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peetsheets
50,"The history of Malibu, in a beach house!","The former beach house of the Adamson family, on the beach overlooking Malibu Pier and Surfrider beach, is a must see for first time visitors to Malibu. Malibu is not all about today's celebrity. The Rindge and Adamson families were the first to settle there, and in style. Beautiful gem of a house, regardless of the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PassportInPurse
50,A Perfect Day In Malibu,"I have driven by the Adamson House numerous times wondering what's behind those walls. So, my friend & I took the home tour and we where blown away. First, the grounds and views of the ocean, mountains, Malibu Pier, etc. are breathtaking. The one-of-a-kind 1929 home's interior was designed to perfection and not a detail was missed. The family owned a tile factory near the home, so they took full advantage of their decorative tile supply. Hand painted cabinetry, walls and ceilings, and leaded windows throughout of entire home. The first dishwasher is still in the kitchen along with the Adamson's furniture, glassware, china, bedspreads, clothing, etc. Our docent gave us such interesting stories of the family and history lessons of the era. Do take this tour, you will enjoy every minute of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonbuild
40,A quaint spot,"Its a historic house on the beach that is beautiful. The color palette is amazing. Parking is next to the entrance, $.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZachR899
50,Went to a wedding here,"We went to a wedding here in October. It was a beautiful ceremony in the side yard under the tree. The reception was in the back. Lovely location by the beach and getting to look at all the colors of the tile. I really appreciated the house tour, after the ceremony. The house has so many interesting details inside. I do wish they let you take photos inside but I understand why they don't. Not sure if it's worth a special trip if you only have a limited amount of time in the area but worth it if you live in or near Malibu and have never gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supercharger5150
50,"Low cost parking, great park",I was looking for a reasonable place to park and take some pictures. This place was all I needed and more. A lovely old beach house with beautifully cared for gardens and spectacular lagoon and LA view. A credit to the state park system.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaguaroJoe
40,beautiful place and history very interesting,Loved learning the history of Malibu! Beautiful place....definitely worth the visit!We never knew so much about Malibu. The entrance fee was only $7/person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rozbudr
40,Beautiful Wedding location,"We attended a wedding here this past weekend - beautiful outdoor location, many nice locations for pictures. Right on the beach, but no actual beach access from the Adamson house property (fenced in). Our only issue was it was difficult having food/drinks with our kids b/c there is nowhere to sit - everywhere on the property is historic tiles, so you can't sit on anything or set anything down! Otherwise a beautiful facility with a very interesting history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/otcarla28
50,Worth the short drivefrom LA,"On a beautiful day in August we toured the gardens and Adamson house in Malibu. It was only my wife and I on the garden tour with a very knowledgeable guide and then 3 of us for the house tour. It was a wonderful way to spend the morning, the guides were great, the house very interesting and the views excellent. The furnishings, clothes still out, and tiles were worth the visit.It was all made better by visualizing the place when it was built and nothing else was in sight.Go early, we had a tour bus come at the end of our visit and it's a small place so early is better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LS_52_H
50,Stunning views and impressive architecture.,"A friend recommended that we take advantage of this beautiful home tour in Malibu. Because of this strained economy, my husband and I expected a modest Spanish stucco house with deferred maintenance. We couldn't have been more surprised and impressed by the grandeur and beauty of the grounds and the Spanish Colonial Revival mansion. Our docent was very enthusiastic about the property and its history and was able to give human interest to the story of the families, who have owned this beautiful part of Malibu, California. We learned alot of California history in the Museum, and admired the Malibu tile and other stylistic details which remain in the home. The views from each window are spectacular and the house, though elegant, remains cozy and inviting. It is a wonderful outing on a beautiful sun shiny day. If you're a birder, be certain to bring your binoculars, as there is a sanctuary very close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbmegowan
50,The Best Place To See Old Malibu Tile!,"The Adamson and Malibu Lagoon Museum is just North of the Malibu Pier. (south of Cross Creek on PCH). It is another great inexensive way to hang out at the beach. You need a reservation to park inside the grounds and take the tour of the Adamson House. The Rindge family, which controled Malibu privately for many years in the 1820s-40s, married with the Adamson family. This was their beach house. Just as Catalina Island had a tile factory in those days, so did the Rindges. The result is some of the most amazing tiles ever set into walls and floors. Richard Keits- RTK Studios of Ojai makes many of the old patterns. Catalina Picture Tile on Camarillo makes all of the ship tiles from the childrens bathroom. When you visit, you will see why!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445ChrisR
50,Worth a visit,"Unique setting and history to this beautiful, unusal house. Our docent was extremely knowlegable , this has got to be one of the best guided tours I've been on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryklynette
50,Great House. Beautiful Location.,"Beautiful house decorated with thousands of tile from Malibu Pottery. Excellent docents with small groups (ours was 5) allows for plenty of visitor questions.Located right on Surfrider Beach, the house has a spectacular view of the Pacific, Malibu Pier and ...the surfers!If you visit during the summer, visit on a weekday. The weekend beach traffic can be a mess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biker_dan
50,a must see museum,"incredible grounds directly on the beach, $7 tours on Fridays at 10AM, one of the first buildings in malibu and still looks fabulous",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/statement96
40,Beautiful location!,"This is a very interesting site. If you have the notion to take the garden tour I would not say that it was a waste of time but it was not very informative about the gardens. However, you do get to see the pool and pool house which is not included on the regular tour. The house tour is very good and if you are in the area I would recommend that you make time for this. A lot of history on Malibu and a chance to see a beautiful and unusual home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albizia
50,An original!,"The house, built by the daughter of the owners of the Malibu ranch and her husband in the 1920s is a Spanich colonial with tons of original Malibu tile. It is a gem and well worth the trip for docent led tours and the view. Then head to Duke's for lumch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwens11
50,A Malibu Gem!,"This is a must see, but you need reservations to take a tour? The Adamson House is chalk full of old ""Malibu Pottery"" tiles from the original pottery that was located on the property in the 1920's. Beautiful tiles, beautiful house, beautiful setting on the Malibu lagoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mlmartin457
50,Fascinating home,"The Adamson House has been on our list of places to visit and we're so glad we did finally go; it's really an incredible home. Almost razed by the State, local citizens cared enough to keep this historic home intact. The location is quite amazing; right on the beach about a quarter mile West of the Malibu Pier and the start of the Malibu Colony. The homes' architectural details are so impressive and thoughtful, particularly the intricate, hand-painted indigenous Malibu tile. At one point, 5 members of the Adamson family lived here beginning in late 1920s/1930s; what's remarkable is that original clothing, books and furniture are from the family and the furniture is laid out the way it was when the family lived in it. The property is remarkably preserved, especially considering it sits about 6 feet above the Pacific and is about 100 feet from the waves.Francine was our docent or tour guide and she did a great job describing not only the architectural detail but the human aspect as well, since this was a home for two parents and three children.We toured the house, pool area and immediate grounds surrounding the house. We understand there is a garden tour as well, which walks through the beautiful grounds overlooking the surf and a lively marsh just to the West, so those interested in bird life and landscaping, this also looks interesting (the adjacent marshland is not part of the Adamson House tour). Altogether, this is a great 1-1 1/2 hour experience definitely worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarrenB07481
40,Interesting,Its $7 per person to get in and was very interesting to see - recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryH575
50,I love the tiles!,Right next to the ocean - what an artistic masterpiece,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1222JeffK
50,Great house,"Beautiful house, inside and out. Every single room is richly decorated with tile work. The cabinetry is also really well made and ornamented. Unfortunately, they don't allow pictures to be taken inside. It was a great way to spend an afternoon. We really enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonaLisa1506
50,A must see when visiting Malibu!,"We loved this house! It is such a treasure on this very modern piece of coastline. This house itself is beautiful and the tiles that were made there are exquisite. The tour is very informative and well worth paying for as you get a real in depth history of the area, the building, the people who built it, and people who have used it since. Go see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markybritt
50,An incredible facilily right on Malibu Beach.........,the ocean is at your feet......and the views are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/checkercab
40,Tiles!,"The tile work on Adamson House is insane -- I spent an hour just wandering around the outside taking pictures, and there are very helpful explanatory markers. I didn't get to see inside as it was closed when I was there -- minus one star for not being open on my schedule ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AiZeeKay
50,So glad we went,"We've lived here all our lives and passed this often, but visiting whetted our appetite to learn more about this family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/compulvisetraveler
50,An extravaganza of tilework in a mission-style 1930 home,This big home/little mansion shows off the tilework that this area was known for. The archectecture was well thought-out and the execution was exemplary. The setting is stunning--the view of the beach from the balcony is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwlyon
40,Historical Malibu,Take a tour of the Adamson House. Well worth it. The historical and cultural information is interesting and the place is in a magical setting. Combine it with a 5 minute trip up the hill to Serra Retreat for an amazing view of Malibu Colony.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nili99
50,Excellent visit of an old Spanish mansion in Malibu,"If you are interested in history, go there for a group visit that will last more than 2 hours. The guide was great and gave a lot of information on the area, going back to the Indians that were there and the first Spaniards who moved to California. The house is really beautiful and has a very nice Spanish/Moorish style.The beach around is very nice if you want to have a walk there. And if you are friend with celebrities, some of them have mansions on the seaside that are located not far away...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gens1980
50,If you like California Vintage Spanish Tile,Step back in time and check this museum out for the amazing ceramic tile. This house showcased Malibu Tile back in the day. The house and grounds are very inspiring and have a very different vibe from the beach/surf culture right outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annacapa
40,Historic and lovely - a good part of a Malibu Day...,Interesting home with lot's of history. Take a tour then head to Moonshadows and grab a 'beach bed' on the deck for lunch or appetizers and coctails - take in the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfek617
40,A true original Malibu landmark,"This is a very interesting house which essentially tells the story of the way in which Malibu was developed. The story of how the family tried to prevent the highway being constructed (and eventually failed in their attempt) is a passionate story as indeed is the history of the family thereafter and how the house came to be saved. There is a small museum and gift shop which are well laid out but we were particularly pleased by the guided tour. The guides are volunteers and dedicated to the future preservation of the house. The views out to sea are amazing and worth a visit for that alone. The tour guide was extremely good at judging how to ""pitch"" the tour to a number of visitors. The tour groups are small. The house has an interesting story in relation to its decoration and the preservation of the furniture and artefacts. It deserves to be supported and tells a fascinating tale of how the area became developed for housing and its later occupation by filmstars etc. Public car parking is immediately available outside the house. The tour itself was no more than $7 per person. There is also an opportunity to spend time going round the small museum and shop. Well worth a visit and a good introduction to ""old"" Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IANandARI
50,Such a beautiful visit,"As soon as you drive off the highway there is a parking lot you pay to park and walk right into the most beautiful secret garden,Plants trees and flowers and a beautiful view of the ocean. You can tour the house with a guide and it has a very small interesting museum.I really like the gift shop with many books about old Maliibu and fun items.The clerk was very knowledable about the home and its owners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bridgetpianos
50,"A beautiful view of ""Old Malibu"" - REALLY old Malibu!",A gorgeous house museum located on a gorgeous piece of land. Well worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaofPgh
50,Adamson House in Malibu,We visited the Adamson House in Malibu on a Sunday. Our hosts assumed it would be open--but the good news is that if that's the only day you can visit--you CAN walk around the house and the surrounding grounds and there are several plaques to read on the family and the house. I thoroughly enjoyed it and wished I could have toured the home indoors. The history behind the family and their fight in attempting to keep the Pacific Coast Highway from invading their property was very interesting. The groundskeeper there that day was very affable and informative. I would definitely return if I'm in that area again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dovhoz
50,another LA gem,"For $7 you can tour this historic house on the beach. It is full of tile work, lovely garden and fabulous ocean views. You must park outside in the paid lot and walk in. Definitely worth a trip to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfd
20,Beautiful Site but the house stinks!,The house is located right by Malibu Lagoon in the most beautiful setting but unfortunately the museum/house stinks so badly we had to leave 10 minutes after the tour started. I DO NOT recommend this tour unless you bring an oxygen mask.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniMC_10
50,delightful,"This half-hour-long, docent tour gives you some California social history, art history (the tiles are fabulous) and great views of the beach and coast.A wealthy man from Massachusetts bought 13,000 acres of the Malibu Ranch in 1892 and his colorful descendants lived there in the ""summer cottage"" built around 1930. At one point they looked for oil and found clay instead, using it to start a tile company. Stars of the day like Bing Crosby leased beach frontage property for $1 per foot and put up shacks to enjoy the surf.We loved it all. Went to the Getty Villa, then 10 minutes up to Adamson House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celadonteapot
50,Very enjoyable historic home tour,"On Friday 5/30/08, I took the docent led garden tour as well as the tour of the interior of the Adamson House. I liked this tour because the docents were very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about their subject, and they were also very patient with people's questions. I thought it was a good tour for all ages.The original owners, the Rindge and Adamson families, really outdid themselves when it came to decorating their home. I was very impressed with all that tilework in and around the house...especially that tilework that resembles an oriental throw rug. The fountains on the grounds were just spectatular and I got a real kick out of seeing the fancy dog's bath! So much attention to detail in every area of the property from ceiling to baseboards...but yet it didn't feel like some of the stuffier historic homes one might tour in other places. The Adamson House definitely had that classic laid back ""California"" feel to it...and learning the stories about the families who lived there gives you a real sense of place of what Malibu was like before it became a ""trendy"" spot for celebrities and celebrity watchers.Taking photos or video inside of the building is off limits, but there are scads of opportunities to take pictures of the exterior of the house, the gardens and also pictures of the Malibu Lagoon and Surfrider beach, too! I also recommend visiting the gift shop there because there are a variety of great souvenir items there related to the history of the home, and you can even buy tiles just like what's in the house. Next time I go to Malibu, I definitely plan to tour this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesertRose15
