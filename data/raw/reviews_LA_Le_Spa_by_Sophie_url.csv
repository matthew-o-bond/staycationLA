50,Amazing Spa!!!,"I've been to this Spa twice and each experience was beyond amazing! Everything from the decor, reception and massage is all done with the customer in mind and it makes you feel every special. I've done both massages and facials and both are some of the best massages ive gotten. A lot has to do with the atmosphere as well. The beds are extremely comfortable, music is great and it smells amazing! Would definitely recommend and it's a great gift idea for a loved one as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessagR1951HC
50,Skincare,I love this place. Been a member for 10 plus years now and they have maintained the health of my skin. My skin continues to look great due to their consistent quality assistance and genuine care. I have recently introduced them to my younger sister Kean and she has recently renewed her membership with them as well. One of my best friends has been a member for just as long as I have and we all thank Le Spa by Sophie for everything they have done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keenay2016
50,Facial + Massage,"Found a deal on Groupon for $143 for for an advanced facial and one massage (worth $258)I opted for the thermo and cryotherapy facial (50 min) + back muscle relief (25 min)I sat down and was greeted immediately and offered a glass of wine and apple/cinnamon infused tea. I then met with their specialist to go over my skin issues and back/shoulder pain.I got the massage first and it was one of the best massages I‚Äôve gotten! I had SO many knots in my upper back and shoulder area - my lady was able to get most of it out. She could tell I have been very tense. I even got a head massage at the end which I love (in general)The facial was just as awesome! She did extractions, the cryo and thermo therapy and then a nice mask at the end. I feel so refreshed.I wasn‚Äôt able to use their amenities (shower, sauna, steam room) but the gentleman up front offered to give me a card to come back to use it. Such a nice gesture.The massage bed was perfect. Not too hard, the pillow below my feet was at the perfect height. It was warm and I was cozy.After I was done, I was offered their cucumber infused warm water and a delicious macaroon and marshmallows. What a treat!Overall, I had a great experience. I would highly recommend. I can‚Äôt wait to come back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetlibra
50,Cute,Just wrapped up my clarifying facial with Selene and walked out feeling like a queen üôåüèªüë∏üèªThe spa is very clean and everything looks new. I always appreciate a little bubbly before walking into a facial and a sweet snack at the end. It‚Äôs definitely on the pricey end but worth it so far!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dipark703
