20,Not a safe place to go camping,"I have been coming to Crystal Lake since 2010, and i have watched the place get worse and worse as timed passed. I like the place as it has been a family tradition to come and spend the night, hike, and go fishing but we have decided to never go back again for our own safety.It seems like every time we go there are groups of people who have zero respect for others, and there is NO CONTROL at the campsites).The last time we went there were a group of about 30 people who started playing music at night and it was so loud we could not even speak to each other.As the night progressed we became more and more frustrated but hoped they would stop. A few hours later they started drinking, fighting, throwing stuff at each other and becoming increasingly violent. Other people were defecating by their tents, they did not even bother using the restrooms!!!If you are thinking about coming here I would recommend going somewhere else, specially if you have children. It is not a safe place to be at, nor is it a peaceful place to rest at night.I really hope they do something about this.Stay safe people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naturelovernatalia
30,Camping For a Couple of Nights,"We went up camping for a couple of nights on the weekend after the 4th of July. There were plenty of folks, so we had to go up to loops E, F, G. We found out that it is closed to vehicle traffic--you can't drive up and park by your camp sight--so we made several trips with our camping gear. Another surprise is that there is no water; you gotta bring in your own water to the campsite (?). The area is nice, and where people start their hikes up into the mountains and to Little Jimmy Trail Camp. There's a parking area at the top with a restaurant/store, also a visitor center, and a few places for water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricsandimas
40,"Nice hike, snow melt and rain helped","The lake has t been that great in years. The snow melt and rain has helped and all the green with snow in the higher elevations looks great.Stop in at the Crystal Lake Cafe, good food and nice owner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samfmetro
30,disappointed,It is definately a beautiful area. I remembered my dad bringing me here nearly 50 years ago and it has changed quite a bit. The lake was barely a pond and it was 75% covered with moss and weeds. I think the lake is maybe 3 acres in size??? I am sure the camping is great here and there is also the close by restaurant to go to. Lots of hiking in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timg103
10,Crystal Lake,DO NOT GO!!!! The lake is dry!!! It was very disappointing. It was also a windy road. Go somewhere else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyJackie2010
40,Camping Without Worries,"If you are thinking of a getaway far from the maddening crowd, look no further. This is it but the getaway is for those who love the outdoors. Meaning- get out and stay out in tents ( though the option to hire a cabin exists, but whoever plans a camping in a cabin). Ideally if its a large family or a group, it would only add to the fun. Coming to the basics. You have everything you need to enjoy the outdoors. Well placed camping sites and the vehicle goes right up to the site. Very well organized by the Forest rangers who are extremely helpful. The camping sites cannot be booked as it is on a first come first occupied basis. however there are nearly 120 camp sites so its not really a problem getting a site. The cottages ( qty 3) can be booked online but I dont recommend staying in a cabin, if you plant to camp outdoors. Getting to the basics as to what needs to be done.First be clear that if you like camping you need to rough it out a bit. Basics as far as washroom is concerned but sufficient.If you are worried about bugs and mosquitoes carry the requisite oils.Secondly, carry essentials for camping apart from tents. If you dont know what that is, it about time you got out!Thirdly get sufficient stuff for barbecuing including for getting a fire going. Barbecue pits are available but thats about all. Though there is also a store closeby to provide all the essentials but its no fun buying stuff there or eating in the restaurant there. Remember? You have come to camp.Finally get the proper gear for hiking as there are lovely trails there to savour.A trip to really remember once you get back to the daily humdrum of the city. Point to note that there is no connectivity so its total peace for the time you are ou. Enjoy the San Gabriel Mountains !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reribh
50,Great Camping location,"Went with my Girl Scouts multiple times, always had a great time. Much better now that more loops are open. We always enjoyed ourselves. There is definitely wildlife, so be ready and don't leave your food out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chiquens
50,Mountain drive,Lovely drive in the San Gabriel Mountains with numerous places to stop for scenic views. Many twists and turns but worth it for the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanH598
50,A beautiful place in the mountains!,"With partner and family members we drove up Azusa Blvd. in Hacienda Heights all the way to the foothills. Then up to San Gabriel Dam where we stopped and took pictures. The air was cool, pure blue skies, little traffic. In other words, perfect conditions. Eventually we arrived at Crystal Lake, but not the lake itself, which was another couple of miles further. We went to the camping and recreational area, where I had been several times in the past, sometimes when covered with snow. This time we saw several deer at the side of the road. We stopped, and took pictures of them through the open window. They weren't scared, and we spent some time watching them. Soon, we were at the parking area, got out, and breathed the clean, fresh air. We went into the cabin there, a combination of restaurant and museum, with many interesting things to look at. The owner/cook prepared lunch for all of us. I had seen him last December, and we had a talk about the photos he had of bears in the area. We enjoyed the delicious coffee and home-made brownies which he made, after having various lunch items, so large we took some home with us! We walked around the area, seeing more deer, and pine cones all about. We left, returning to Azusa with hardly any traffic. We stopped at some look out places, and looked down at the winding road. A beautiful bright moon was clearly visible, as was the pure blue sky, and the multi-colored hills. I hope to return there the next time I have willing company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimboPhotoman
50,Memorable Road Trip!!!!!,"We went to Crystal Lake unaware of what to expect. We were having Brunch and suddenly decided to pay this place a visit.I am not sorry we did. It is a beautiful place, peaceful and large enough to get lost. Some of us got lost for a while there but we found our way back to the lake. It was not so far away from civilization and yet it is such relaxing and wonderful forest. You may purchase all you need up there but if you are on a budget, bring your own snacks and supplies.I am making plans to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissDCWilson
40,Quick and relaxing escape,"Crystal Lake is a beautiful drive up highway 39. It is an easy walk to the lake. It was non-existent during the drought. Now, it is filling up again. If you are lucky you will see some deer. The people who run the place are quite friendly. Help yourself to a hot chocolate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryp661
50,great bike climb up to the lake,"from the time you turn onto the road in Azusa to head up to crystal lake you will be climbing. it's about 26 miles and well over 5000' of elevation gain, so you are looking at an average of some 200 ft per mile, which is an average of about 4% grade. the last few miles are closer to 400 ft per mile (average of 8% grade), but it's not terribly difficult. I didn't see anyone on the way up, but I sure did see a lot of folks dotting the road on the way back down. guess the locals leave a little later than I did. give yourself at least 4 hours to complete the up and back unless you are a really strong rider. the lake is at about 6000' so it's not terribly high for those affected by altitude. just be careful on the way back down as the road can be steep and windy. be sure to look at the beautiful scenery on the way up as the downhill requires you to keep your mind and eyes on the road!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joemontana16
50,After your hike go to Adam's,"This is a little off-beat as reviews of a hiking area goes but there's a little gem few people know about and that's the Crystal Lake General Store and/or Cafe. Adam is the owner/ cook and he's great at cooking and just a general all-around nice, family guy. My suggestion is to order some zucchini bread before you start out on your hike to make sure he'll have some waiting for you when you're done because you don't want to leave for home without it. It is the BEST zucchini bread for miles around. One of the things my husband and younger daughter loves is his Frito chili. He opens a bag of Fritos and either pours the chili in it or serves the Fritos on a paper boat and serves the chili over that. They love it ! His coffee and hot chocolate are perfect ater a nippy afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlashbackFour
40,My Favorite drive for Canyon carving with a lake at the end,The drive up to Crystal Lake is half the fun of getting there. The other half is the piping hot bowl o chili and a burger at the lodge next to the lake open late spring until fall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frazgo
50,Camping in SoCal????,"looking for a relaxing way to spend a day or a weekend in socal. Head up to Crystal Lake in the San Gabriel mountains. Just about an hour drive outside of the city, and you're trasported into another, more peaceful world to unwind with nature. You can hike, day camp, overnight camp, and just relax to be at peace with nature. We took a day trip on a sunny Sunday, took about 45min to get to the top. And, at the top we ran into the Crystal Lake Trading Post! Just a humble little trading post where you can get snacks, burgers, chicken sandwiches, frito pie, etc etc....and let's not forget about their homemade CHILI and BROWNIES! Chili was great, and really hit the spot, and the brownie was super simple, moist, and delicious, just a perfect snack after you reach the top of the hill.They have cabins you can rent up there as well, right next to the trading post, as well as a visitors center with an extremely helpful park ranger, complete with maps of the actual campgrounds as well. About a mile down from the trading post area is Crystal Lake, not impressive, as it's extremely low right now due to our water shortage here in socal, but still a great time hiking around and just being outside with nature and CLEAN AIR!!! Escape the city smog and head up the hill, you'll be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattwcorbin
50,Best motorcycle ride,If you want to have a great motorcycle ride go to crystal lake. The road there is just great to ride. .When you get there some times the little cafe might be open if so try there chili very good. as FAR AS A LAKE THERE ISNT ONE IT'S JUST A GREAT DESTINATION FOR YOU TO TAKE A RIDE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikerH2937ID
30,Amazing drive up here--so beautiful!,We came to Crystal Lake via the Lake road…so much fun to drive and so beautiful. The café has a standard menu of breakfast and lunch items. My burger and fries were simply okay. Inside the café is sorta a general store. Owner and family run it. Nice people.It did get a bit crowded but everyone is in a good mood up in the beautiful hills.Don’t think I’d return for the food but certainly for the views. 3 star food with a 10 star view—wait only goes to five! They get 3 cause this review is café and not the view.There is also a ranger-visitor station there with more info about the areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Relaxation,"Beautiful, peaceful location. Nice place to just kick back. Wonderful view.Not far from the Super 8 motel. Good location for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulubruin08
40,The hills are alive,"Love going here. If you visit, make sure to stop at the cafe, and get some banana nut bread! Great for an easy snow trips, too bad the lake is in such disrepair. But, don't let that deter you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FatallyLost
40,Pretty Lake in the San Gabriel Mountains,We have enjoyed going to Crystal Lake in the San Gabriel Mountains many times. The most recent time we enjoyed a picnic lunch and a hike. Its a nice one to do if staying in the San Gabriel Valley area of LA.Note: There is a campground here as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Dead End,The road no longer goes through to Angeles Crest highway but the dead end trip is well worth it for motorcycle enthuisiasts. Lots of twisties and elevation changes. The scenery is very nice with a tranquil lunch spot in the middle of nowhere. October 2011.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocjohnyb
50,Magnificent location,"At this time of year the campsite was empty. The surrounding woodland and hills provide a spectacular backdrop to a very quiet and nature filled 3 nights. Squirrels throwing acorns, deer roaming freely around the area and, one evening, a young bear rummaging through cafe bins nearby.The weather was excellent and in the evening, in spite of the high risk fire warnings, fire rings were provided and allowed us to cook and keep warm before turning in.The lake itself is disappointing as it is drying up. The only natural lake in the area, conservation efforts appear to be failing. So sad as I'm sure it was quite lovely in its heyday.The nearby cafe, residence of Bubba the cat, and run by Adam, is a welcome oasis and has some fine foods.All in all, can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SquishyGeorge
50,"As Close to L.A. as Angels Crest, not as Cold at Night!","Crystal Lake is the ONLY Naturally Occurring Lake in all the San Gabriel Mountains. It is fed solely from ground water and ice/snow melt. It has been shrunken and choked from ashes of recent fires but it is making a come-back. And there are still fish. No watercrafts allowed.I think it is a better overnight family destination than my usual choice of Angels Crest. While it cant compare to the variety of trails and feeling of being really deep into the wilderness, the advantage is it does not get as freezing cold as it does in the Crest. So the nights are much more pleasant.The campgrounds just reopened two years ago. And is well worth the drive. There are two closer campgrounds on the way there, but unfortunately like many other camping destinations, Scumbags stay at the closer sites so they can get drunk, loud and throw trash someplace other than the city for a night or two. So just keep driving, it is well worth it. We still had a bit of trash to clean up from our site before pitching our tents, but nothing close to the piles of trash seen along the road and grounds at the closer sites.The location is poorly marked. There is a sign for the ""Crystal Lake Store"" but not for the campgrounds. So one could easily assume, that road leads to the store but the campsite is further up. It is not. The Campground is at the store. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.The campground is divided into three sites, all close together and diverse. The restrooms and water sources are near all the sites and the Wheelchair sites are very accessible. Complete with concrete around the fire rings/grills and parking right at the site.The hike to the Lake is easy, that trailhead and the one to Cedar Canyon is right there and the Cedar Canyon trail looked completely unused. Sweet! It was steep in parts but so what and it trails along the creek and the fact that it seems unused is all the better.Check the store hours and expect to pay a premium for supplies or food. Dont expect perishables like milk, because there are none. Not even dehydrated or non dairy. Always best to pack everything you think you'll need and use the store as a back up, not as your only source of food. The owner is very nice and has helpful information, but the store is not open every day. So be prepared.I was concerned about the mosquitoes but I had just discovered ""Kids Herbal Armor"" Natural Insect Repellent and it worked very well. I did not get a single bite.I looked at the cabins. Not a very good deal for the prices but they are the only ones around. All over $100 and the one advertised as ""Wheelchair Accessible"" was not. Maybe a chair could get through the front door, but no way one gets into the bathroom, so it simply is not accessible.Any resemblance to the lake of the same name from the movie ""Friday the 13th"" is purely coincidental... or is it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
