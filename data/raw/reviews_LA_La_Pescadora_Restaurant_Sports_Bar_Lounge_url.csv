40,Mexican Restaurant in uptown whittier,"I ordered the chili verde plate and was very happy with the portions and it tasted great. I also ordered a Margarita and it came in a very large glass, a really good deal. I highly recommend this restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracyhU4571HW
50,Great margaritas!,"I had dinner and a few drinks here the other night and had a good time. Very knowledgeable bartenders! I wasn't aware of how many different types of tequilas there were, so I sampled a few different brands! I also had the bacon wrapped shrimp as an appetizer, and they were delicoius! For dinner I had a combo of taquitos and chicken enchiladas, and they were very tasty. It was Friday night, and the mariachi band was playing, around the restaurant, so it made talking a bit of a challenge. I will definitely make a stop by here next time I'm in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cold1za
50,great place to grab some tacos & beer.,"Great mexican food. Family atmosphere. This is the kind of place you want to hang out with friends and family, drink some coronas, and watch a game or boxing fight. Very friendly staff and bartenders.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshinacrockett
