50,"The Italian in Me! was an entertaining evening, laughs and sighs, Great one woman show!","The Italian in Me, was a funny, amusing and touching one woman show. Dina Morrone gave a wonderful performance, and made you believe you were with her in Roma as she was first gazing at St. Peter's Basilica! The theater is small and great seating. We were in ihefront row! Just get there a little early and park across the street for $5.00, There were drinks before the show and food, snacks, Italian bread cheese, meats, cookies afterwards! It was a great treat to Meet Dina in person, she is beautiful and charming! Watch for her in other things! Its a non profit theater and the support local artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaMia796
40,Intimate Setting for Good Theatre,"This theatre holds less than 150 people. Chairs are pretty comfortable. Nothing fancy. Parking used to be free across the street in a lot during performances. Now it costs $5, which is a still good deal in California. Whoever thought of those baby glasses for wine offered for a donation needs a talking to. Worth looking at their website for upcoming offerings. One-person shows through the summer of 2017 have been extraordinary. Prices are more than affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethTripGurl
