50,Excellent Thursday adventure,Very knowledgeable and engaging staff with excellent wines. Beautiful outdoor seating options and unique gifts.,Sara B
50,Fun Sunday visit,We had a wonderful time at this winery. The tasting and tour was awesome. Wines are very delicious and the box lunch was great to take out to the picnic tables with a glass of wine. We would visit again!,Cheryl Lyn R
40,"Stompest & Lucy Look-a-like contest, a fun day!","We went for a Stompest,in October and donned our Lucy outfits for wine stomping contest and Lucy look alikes. This review is for that event. The Winery is tucked in beautiful country/farm setting with alpacas, chickens, donkeys. They have an outdoor patio for sipping wine and Gift shop. For this event, paid $65.00/pp with BBQ dinner catered thru Stonefire Grill, Wine & Cheese served and DJ. Got free bottles of wine for participating in the games. The Staff is very nice and accommodating. The Vineyards is pretty cool with the names of the wine it will eventually become. They do offer a Wine tasting tour, which we'll plan on doing another day.Certainly a good place to go for a days event with a Girls Day or your honey.",Chona3855
40,Enjoyed the Wine and the Setting,"We were visiting relatives in the area and went out for a drive. We stumbled upon this winery. We each did a wine flight. We enjoyed all of the wines but especially the Reserve Cab and the Reserve Zin. We ordered a glass of each and sat outside in the sun. When we finished we looked around inside the shop, bought 2 bottles of wine and drove back to Palmdale. What a lovely day.",msjradennis
40,Happy With This Accidental Find,"I had no idea this place was here until I saw a Groupon for it, and I'm glad I did. The Groupon I purchased was for 2 people and included a guided tour, tasting 4 of their wines, and a picnic style lunch. I called one of my friends and we made a day of it.I want to start off by saying every employee we encountered was really nice and really helpful. From calling to schedule the reservation, to checking in, to tour, etc., every step of the process was pleasant.Our tour guide Steve was so knowledgeable and entertaining, we learned a lot and had fun while doing it. The wines were good, and to know the story behind them made them even better. The picnic lunch was better than expected with us each getting a decent sandwich, potato salad, cookie, and a bottle of water. There are plenty of places to sit and an expansive ground to walk.One of the things that impressed us most however, is that they have two wines that they bottle in plastic bottles with twist of caps, which come with two plastic cups that fit inside of each other and hold the bottle. The wines are a Chardonnay and a Cab, and by taste you would never know they are bottled in plastic. These are perfect for outdoor movies, concerts, picnics, the beach, the list goes on. The best part, it was only $11 per bottle. We bought a few of the Chardonnay, have since opened and finished them, and at the suggestion of Steve have saved the bottles, you can rinse, and reuse pouring in whatever beverage you feel like making portable.The only reason I am giving a 4 out of 5 is because on the tour, the tastings you get are predetermined, so you do not get to choose. We tasted one white and 3 reds, which might not be preferable to some people, especially as the summer heats up. They make a lovely rose, actually the favorite of all the wines I had that day, but it is not part of the tour (or wasn't when we went). We wouldn't have even known if the woman attending to indoor wine bar hadn't asked us if we tried it. It would be great if at least one of the tastings was of your choosing.",shaneegarcia
40,Nice little find,"Was looking for something to do with a friend and we decided on Agua Dulce Winery. It’s close to home (San Fernando Valley) and the weather was nice (though I’m thinking it may be a little uncomfortable come August). We arrived around noon and found it not at all crowded. Did our tasting with Doug, who looks like he’s in high school but was quite knowledgeable about their wines. After tasting fell in love with the Syrah, so we bough a couple glasses and set out on the property for a little picnic.They have a nice gazebo, which has 4 separate sitting areas. It was a great place to sit and catch up. We played a little horseshoes and checked out the animals they had on the property, goats, chickens, peacocks, some ponies, etc... We also walked around the vineyard and just enjoyed the location.This place was a pleasant surprise in the desert. The only down side for me was there were a lot of kids running around. Agua Dulce does have a family atmosphere but when I’m out tasting and relaxing, screaming kids is just not part of the equation. Having said that, I will definitely go again, though.",GeeRuss
40,Good wines in a nice setting,"We went there during the week, so it wasn't crowded and we had the complete attention of the woman pouring the wine. She was very knowledgeable and knew the wines well. The wines were well made wines from local vines.The tasting room was fairly generic, with the usual accessories, clothing items, etc. The grounds were very nice, it would be a great place for a picnic and I understand that happens a lot on weekends.Just a few minute drive from Vasquez Rocks which is worth a stop. It can get very hot in the summer (100 degrees plus) so check the weather before going. The tasting room itself is air-conditioned.",Philip R
40,Very Nice Vineyard,We recently took a trip up to Santa Clarita to the Agua Dulce Winery. We each had a glass of wine and then toured the area. My grandson has his own row of grapes and there are animals and chickens for small children to out.,Curt K
40,Had a great time.,First let me say we had a great time.The only thing they could improve on is there wine tasting. Did not have water to rinse out glass between wines and needed cracker or something. Other then that we had a very good time will go back next time in town.,Paul W
50,"A Perfect Way to ""Wine"" Down","From check in to the last dark chocolate chip paired with a Syrah Port, we had a grand time at the Agua Dulce Winery. The hostess graciously welcome us and helped us settle in. Steve was our host for an informative stroll over this productive winery. He was a veritable fount of information sharing the interesting history and the journey of the fruit from vine to bottle. This particular tour included a tasty lunch which can be enjoyed in the wine library or on picnic table on their spacious grounds. Thanks for an entertaining and fun Saturday afternoon.",54jh2013
50,Shockingly good wines,"I didn't expect to taste excellent wines here. This is not an area known for wine. I have tasted wines in Italy, and all over California and this wine stands up. Excellent reds. They have fun events and food trucks as well and it is so easy to access of the 14 freeway. A real gem, don't be a snob and give it a try.",JKPImageFusion
50,Barrel Tasting and Lunch!,"We used a Groupon for a barrel tasting tour and sandwich lunch for 2 and had a fantastic time! Every wine we tried was really tasty. I'm not much of a white wine drinker, but my husband and I both really enjoyed the whites we tasted.The barrel tasting and tour was a terrific experience. I loved tasting the wine right from the barrel and then sampling the finished product in the wine room.The lunch was tasty, though not terribly gourmet, but the setting was gorgeous!!! We were also able to buy glasses of wine to accompany our lunch as well.We will be back!",Kelly W
30,A beautiful day and great value!!,We purchased the picnic lunch and wine tour on Living Social and had a great time at Agua Dulce Winery. Steve gave us a great tour of the facilities and was very knowledgeable and accommodating. There were many wines to taste including some straight from the barrel. The picnic lunch was from a local place and was very good. A nice day and a good value.,Betti S
50,Wine tasting and lunch:-),Went here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends and had a fabulous time! Took a tour of the winery and had a lovely lunch. The grounds are really beautiful and they even have some animals:-),Live2trade
50,An enjoyable afternoon.,"We went to the winery to pick up our wine club selections. We packed a lunch and sat out on the patio. What a gorgeous day. Clouds keeping the heat down, what a peaceful place to sit and catch up with family. After lunch, we went inside to shop the unusual and quaint gifts and then to wine tasting. We had our daughter with us and she was quite surprised at the selection of wines that were offered. Steve was our guide. I remembered him from the tour that we did earlier in the year. He is such a knowledgeable and entertaining guy and just made this place perfect for the day. Well, after having our fill of delicious wines, I have to say that it was a successful day in that we got over half of our Christmas shopping done too.",Nancy E
40,"If You Live in the AV, You Have to Visit This Winery & Bring Out of State Guests","They are well versed in the fine art of winemaking and tastings. I've joined their wine club before but we couldn't drink it all and were giving away most of it, so we stopped. It's a great place to bring out of state guests to show them a local view of California wine tasting. They also offer educational classes and have specials for groups that want to meet here for a wine experience.",EllieRKay
30,No that impressed,"We stopped by for a tour and wine tasting. Marylyn was our bartender and if it weren't for her knowledge of wine and fun persinality, this would've gotten 1 star. The wine was so-so, but their gift shop was excellent!! Sadly, not worth another stop in our opinion.",KDacker
50,Informative Tour and Great Folks,"My wife and I researched activities in the L.A. area and came upon Agua Dulce Vineyards. We checked Groupon and purchased two tickets, (They were pleased that we saw them on groupon), and came by this past Sunday. From the start, the manager Steve Wizan, came over and introduced himself and introduced Shannon who actually arranged to fit us in to the already filled tour schedule. Both are very nice folks and a deep part of the operational team. Steve walked us through the nuts and bolts of the wine making process and we tasted a few delicious merlots and cabernets. Really well assembled operation... We returned shortly after to the shop to have a lunch prepared for us and MORE wine. Finally, we assembled in the shop area and chatted a bit more with a local couple we met and had more wine... All in all, a really nice time in a beautiful region with great hosts...",NY-Hormiga
30,"nice tour and shop, ok wine","We had a nice sunday here at Aqua Dulce. Nice tour of the winery, Steve was great, very nice and informative. We got to taste two wines straight from the barrel! That was a treat that other places don't offer. The wines themselves were ok. We didn't buy any wine- my grandmother wanted to buy the Port that she loved! (it was way too sweet for the rest of us) but it was way too expensive. If you become a member you actually get a really price on wines; so if you like their wine it's a great deal.",JackJack6
50,Relaxation,"Called in Sunday morning asking about tours. Told to stop by a little early to tag along with the 12pm tour for $15pp. The outside looked a bit industrial, and was quite hot (to be expected), but when we went in it was a wonderfully cool building with lots of little items for sale, almost like a boutique. They had a cooler with cheeses and meats for purchase if you decided to snack with your tasting and offered little crackers and chocolates during the tastings. The only white (chardonnay) they had was sold out so beware it may be an all red tasting. I'm a white drinker, but still enjoyed many of the reds I tasted.I'd estimate there were about 20 or so people on our tour. It started out with our informative guide giving each of us a tasting of the cab and then the zin. We walked out to the vines sipping on the zin while he gave us background on the winery's beginnings. We each were allowed to pull a few grapes and taste, as it was less than a month from harvest time, and then were walked in to the storage area. We each sampled two wines from the oak barrels that were ""young"" and still a few years from the bottling process. We were taken from there to the bottling area and then from there back to the front of the store, where the lovely lady behind the counter let us try a few other wines on the list that we did not try during the tour. We ended up buying a glass of the merlot reserve for $7 (love that their wines are just a flat $7 per glass!) and it was a hefty pour! Lounged around outside at the shaded tables sipping the wine and nibbling on crackers. There was a small pressure to sign up for the membership but nothing that was off-putting.Overall, for the same price we usually pay for a standard tasting, we got an extremely informative tour and a good 6-7 tastings! Everyone there was so friendly and I liked a lot of the wines. Such a relaxing way to spend a day.",alimariew
30,Wasn't that impressed,Finally had the chance to try out this place but I was disappointed. I love sweet wines but this winery had none. The port was sweeter than the other red wines but no where near the dessert wines I am used to. I have visited several wineries and usually buy a few bottles to take home but sadly I didn't purchase any this visit. I don't think that the bottles are worth the price. Not only that but I felt the employees pushed their wine club a little too much.I was a little worried at first because when we checked in the lady behind the counter informed me that they didn't have my reservation but had my friends. How could that be if I am the one who called? Finally she found me. She wasn't that friendly and I was glad to find out that a different lady would be helping out with the tastings.,MrsBrandt
50,Nice wines here,"Nice people. Lovely wines. Stopped in for national wine day. They were slammed and yet the ladies pouring were gracious and fun. They explain their wine club without pressure like some places I've been. They sometimes offer a Groupon for tours, tasting, and lunch.",IrishHazelEyes
50,A great day!,"Did the horseback wine tasting adventure. What an amazing enjoyable event! It was such a pleasure starting from the greeting, the tour and ending with a delicious lunch. Time and money well spent not to mention the delicious wine. You’ll have a great day and take home some great wines at reasonable price. We vote it as a must do and see!!",LanieBug210
50,great wine!,"love this place!! when we first walked in, we were greeted and welcomed in to taste wine. great gift shop. we tasted many wines. this is a top notch winery. my sister who isn't a red wine drinker, bought 2 bottles! join the wine club. You get great savings on wine and gift shop items. Free tastings as a member also! the staff was helpful, offered food pairings and samples from the gift shop. well worth the drive!",marie b
30,"Okay, but...","Nice facility. gift shop. wine, will not so great, in fact the best reason to go here is to be close to Reyes Winery next door (see separate report). Given the location, one can give these people an A for effort and an A for preservence. The wines we tasted, most all on the list we okay, but nothing to get excited about. then wine tasting is an individual sport, with individual taste buds. You may love them",ranles76
50,Great Winery in our backyard!,"Very friendly personnel, very good wines. Join one of their clubs for better pricing. Great place to bring guests for an afternoon of wine tasting",Cuub55
50,Antelope Valley Secret,"The nicest thing its a ""Cheers"" kinda place someone will always be there you know... and you get a chance to enjoy the fruits of the area by drinking the wines",NoCamper
10,Ugh !,Came up from San Diego to visit family in Santa Clarita. Bought two bottles of their Cabernet Reserve for $ 60.00 bucks a bottle. Absolutely the skunkiest Cab I have ever tasted. Tasted like the stuff they sell at Ralphs for $4.00 a bottle. I would have had a better time if I had purchased Three Buck Chuck at Trader Joe's.,SDGUY95
50,Made for an amazing day!!! Wine snobs you may be a a fan if you just chill and give it a chance!!!,"We were a little hesitant and skeptical about the winery. I mean let's be real- Canyon country for a winery?!!!! But surprisingly we had a great time and we tasted some pretty nice wines! (better than most of temecula) Personally, I was a fan of the reserve syrah and the reserve cab was delicious! And the the chard reserve was nice, as well, toasty and floral but not overly oakey. We did the winery tour and barrel tasting which was really memorable! The guide was well versed and eager to answer questions about the wine making process. She actually shared more information with us than wineries in napa and paso have in the past. The winery has spent a ton of money to asure they are able to produce high quality wine. The staff was super friendly and fun, no snobbiness at all! Oh and for animals lovers, like myself, they not only have some adorable winery dogs wondering around with the owner but they also have a small farm with shetland ponies, a very friendly ram, peacocks, goats, a lama ducks and a grumpy cow! Seriously, check it out- it was a super fun and relaxing day! Oh and they stomp grapes for harvest- Can't wait!!!",Belvieandthemermaid
50,"Fine wines from Acton, CA? Yes!",Wonderful wines at respectable prices! Be sure to try their Reserve varieties. Definitely a worthwhile stop for anyone passing north out of the Los Angeles area/San Fernando Valley.,arnie w
40,So Much Better Than I Expected!,"I have a friend that is a native Santa Clarita-ian (is that a word? I don't think so.) who had been inviting me to the Agua Dulce Vineyard for years. I always resisted going, because of my own misapprehensions. I've tried local vineyards in Virginia, Texas and New York state before, and their wines were always dreadful. Even at some of the vineyards in Paso Robles and Santa Barbara are more ""crafty"" for my taste, and I assumed that wine produced in Santa Clarita would be the same. Finally, she wore me down and got me out to Agua Dulce. What a mistake I had been making, by avoiding this place! We sampled most of the wines they produce, and they were all very good. Surprisingly good. Although I did not love all of them, there were several that I wanted to buy and drink at my own home. I was very pleasantly surprised.The tasting room and grounds are also quite lovely. I envision returning to Aqua Dulce Vineyard in the very near future to enjoy a nice bottle of their wine with a picnic lunch on the grounds.Agua Dulce Vineyard was a lovely surprise in Santa Clarita! Check it out!",BostonSummerGirl
50,Great winery just up the road!!,"Shame on us!!! This winery has been a short drive away for 12 years and we've never taken the time to drive up there. It took a Groupon to get us there and are we ever glad we did. The wine is great and the service and attention wonderful! We spent two hours just tasting and hanging out. After the wonderful wine tasting we became members, buying 6 bottles of fantastic wine at a great discount. We are hooked. We then took a walk around the vineyards. There are picnic tables and a great menagerie of animals (all caged). The store is well stocked with all kinds of spreads, cheeses, wine ""stuff"" and accessories. It's definitely worth the time to check out! Wine tasting is $7.00 per person.",sweetkeys
30,Worth a stop if you're in the area,"Worth a stop if you're in the area -- the only vineyard experience in the area, so if you can't make it to wine country this gives out of towners a little taste of California wine tasting.",AVRLosAngeles
40,"Nice setting with nice staff, but a bit pricey for the better wines.","I had a nice time tasting. For the $7, I think they were comparable for what you could taste vs other places. We were taken care of rather nicely, and even had some time after they closed sitting out on the patio finishing off a bottle purchased there. All in all good. Worth a trip.",fergetfel1
50,"Very friendly, wonderful wines","Unlike an earlier review we found the people to be very friendly, really interested in our questions, and they helped educate us a great deal. We learned so much from the staff at Agua Dulce, even though it was fairly busy when we were there. The wine club membership seems to be a great deal too. We enjoyed the wines we tasted and they are easily as good as most of the wines we've had from Napa and Sonoma.",Joel D
10,very snobby,as wine club members i would think they could at least take the time to say hello and make a little conversation. instead we were greeted with a cold shoulder. it was pretty much a pour-drink-get out the door experiance. so sad. we are rethinking our membership status. :),Climber20892
