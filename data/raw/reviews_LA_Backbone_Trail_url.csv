50,One of the most beautiful hikes in SoCal,"Some of the most incredible mountain and ocean views that you will ever see are on this trail. It can be technical in parts, but is suitable for most. Bring your hiking shoes and your camera and pick a trailhead to experience this one - at nearly 70 miles long, you can come back again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuSteele
40,Beautiful!,"Although it is all but impossible to get lost on this trail, It is important to know that it is 2.5 miles each way. It is part of a loop of several trails but if you only wish to do this trail, it is not a single loop. That being said, it is beautiful and although I was there during summer and the canyon was dry it was still remarkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susieio
40,True Nature Hike,"Plenty of parking available when pulling into lot. There are trail maps and other information explaining what to expect. Hike does change elevation quickly. The path does split several places, but usually ends up in the same, direction. Hike is not hard, but steep at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olivergumbrill
50,"Do it in pieces, hike it in parts, or one long jaunt!","Do it in pieces, hike it in parts, or one long jaunt. There is the Appalachia Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. Los Angeles has the Backbone Trail. Most os us do it in parts, dividing it into day hikes. The ambitious take it all into a multi day hike. Easily supported as one is never too far from restaurant, markets, and trail heads.Watch for deer, coyotes, and mountain lions. Usually a fairly easy trail, but be wary of gravel, shale, and slippery slopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Great nature hike!,"Parking lot at trailhead next to tunnel 1 on Kanan road. On the right going south bound. Went for about a mile and a half and then turned around since it’s not a looped trail. A lot of good elevation changes. Not too hard for how far we got. Bring water. Lots of shade for the most part. Beautiful trees and colors during fall. Unfortunately, Zuma creek didn’t have any water running but there’s a nice little bridge to cross over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsnyqunfrn
50,Go early or later,"This trail can be hot and there is very limited shade...bring adequate water and sunblockThe drive to the trail is a twisty/windy road, it was a great drive.There is a 3 or 6 mile option to hike.Start at 2,030 elevation and climb up 1,081 more feet.Excellent view points.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1078RKannc
50,Best way to work out!,"This is not an easy trail to hike, and there were a few times that I didn't think I could get to the top. However, I did! It was so worth it, too! You can see the Pacific, on a clear day, and it is just so beautiful. There were a few places along the way that I felt the trail had been ""landscaped"" because the foliage was just too perfect! This is a MUST!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244angelah
40,Midlevel hike,"A nice hike through a canyon with mild shifting grades, trees for intermittent shade and 2 different areas to park. Can be crowded on weekends and due to location in the canyon varying temperatures that can switch over a period of a few hours. One of several nice hikes in the Malibu area. Enter on Kanan next to tunnel #1",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcslatts
40,Nice view and ambiance,"Moderate hike in the beginning might not be suitable for young kids, then easy hike if you continue to Tripeaks or even to Sycamore canyon trail head. good hiking boots highly recommended since lot of rocks on the trail head. From parking lot to the sandstone peak was pretty crowded, I went there on Sunday morning. But pass the peak, it was less crowds. Few other trails lead to different places, some are not open for bikes. Dogs must be on leash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492yanb
50,KB,Several side trails and fire roads. Some of the trail systems are better than others. Some side trails are open to bikes some are not. The ocean front trails are great with great views up to ventura and down south to malibu. If you are hiking just stay to right on trails also open to bikes as they are not always looking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylebistline
30,"Great Hike, Bad Bike.","I do not recommend this Trail 4 mountain bikes. A good portion of it is not even open for bikes and you are risking getting a ticket from the Ranger. In addition, you will find yourself carrying your bike uphill for miles and making numerous stops getting off and on the bike over Boulder's.Yes, the views are breathtaking. Next image I'm hiking it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E8311UFsams
50,Great Mountain Biking (and hiking),"My friends and I mountain bike the Backbone Trail a couple of times a week and it is a true gem. The trails go for over 60 miles through the hills. During the right time of the year you can see wildflowers, hawks, deer and if you're lucky even a bobcat or possibly a mountain lion (VERY rare).It is always amazing to me that you can be so close to a major city, but yet in an isolated and beautiful environment. The trails are getting more crowded every year, but that's because they are true gems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zjmikke
50,there are so many legs of this trail,"Be sure to check out the different legs of the trail, it runs uninterrupted from Pac. Pali to Ventura. Some parts are shaded, others are not. Some have amazing views and lots of people, other sections more secluded. Bring water and plan your trip with a car at both ends if you want to do a long leg and not double back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyp400
50,Gorgeous hike up to Sandstone Peak,We took the Mishe Mokwa trail up to Sandstone Peak and the Backbone Trail back down to the car. It was about 6.5 miles and took about three hours. It's an easy hike that even a novice can accomplish. There is free parking by the trail head off of Yerba Buena road. There are some gorgeous views and some fun sights along the way. The hike is only about an hour outside of LA depending on traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KittiQ
50,Backbone trail. Malibu Ca.,"This trail is beautiful and is definitely a ""must do"" if you are into hiking. I have hiked the entire 67 mile backbone trail and this is just part of the trail system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268se
50,Lovely,This is a beautiful walk. It is really lovely and peaceful. There are magnificent views of the sea and beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathrynV217
30,Pay or get ticket; rocky; away from city life,"This trail is not for novices. Now that I read other reviews, I see potential here; but we did not get that. We ended up leaving after about 20 minutes. The signs leave a lot to question.We got a nice view of a modern water treatment plant. Research the location and appropriate entrance before you go.Fortunately, the officer was at our car when we got back. He gave us a warning only. Many others were getting tickets......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpfraser19
50,Beautiful Hike,My husband and I hiked on the trails today. We did the 7 mile loop to check out all the pretty area's and sites. The terrain is uneven in several spots so I would not recommend tennis shoes. We saw most people had them on and did ok. Just go slow with all the pebbles. The views on the trail are so pretty. You feel like you are walking in a juggle on one side and then Inspiration point and others are just so pretty with being so high up. You can see the ocean on one side and the city on the other.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
50,My favorite place to hike in the Santa Monicas.,"I've done sections of this trail many times and the whole thing in 1 week as well. The western sections are perhaps more scenic but all of it is lovely. Lots of ups and downs of course, but very doable. Good to do it with others and arrange a car shuttle so you don't have to back track.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdkLosAngeles
50,You gotta do this trail,"If you like to hike you have to do this trail. It goes up, up up into the Santa Monica Preserve. The weather was great and we had a cool breeze so it made it easier. We did not go all the way to the top but went up for over an hour and a half. Gorgeous views! Small parking fee, port-a-potty available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gobluestl
50,Great hike & views,You need to be prepared for the challenges of a variety of levels and uneven terrain. Also a good guide makes it more interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19022013
50,Sandstone Peak Trail - fave in SoCal,"This is pretty much our favorite hike in SoCal, there's nothing like the views from the top and even the drive there and back through Malibu is stunning! Be sure to bring water as there is no where to fill up along the trail. It's dog friendly too!Check out our post with more hiking tips and some awesome photos:http://mrandmrsadventure.com/2014/06/19/our-favorite-socal-hike-sandstone-peak/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsAdventure
50,Blessed to have this here!,"I live in Malibu and am on this trail almost daily. So many places to start your hike from and all so different from each other. Some of the best attributes of this trail are- the single track that seems to be well taken care of, the wildlife that you see; I have seen coyotes, a bobcat, dear, owls, hawks (Snakes- rattlers- be careful in hot weather!) and the feeling that you are no where near Los Angeles. All of those tourists crowding a trail that isn't even that great- Winding Way, are seriously missing out on the really great trail- Backbone. Start at Busch, Bonsall, Kanan, Will Rodgers, Mulholland…..Bring plenty of water, a hat, and sunscreen. And know where you are going as there are miles and miles of trail. Dogs on leash are welcome but make sure you bring enough water for them in the summer time as it can get very hot and I have seen too many idiots who didn't think to bring their dogs anything. - Really fun- park at the lot just north of Tunnel 1 on Kanan. Go west and meet up with the Zuma View trail off off Busch. Loop back down through Bonsall and have another car waiting there. A couple of hours of beautiful and varied scenery. Endless views of the canyons, mountains and ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianettewells
50,Finest Hiking Trail in LA Area,"If you are an adventurous hiking enthusiast, the Santa Monica Mountains backbone trail is for you. You can take it in sections and you will be amazed at the scenic beauty on the ocean and valley sides of the SM mountains. The best ""free"" thing to do in LA, other than going to the Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,World Class Mountain Biking & Hiking,"I've hiked and biked the entire 65-mile length of the Backbone Trail from where it starts in Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, CA to its terminus just outside of La Jolla State Park in Malibu along Pacific Coast Highway. From Will Rogers, the trail begins as a steep fire road (bikeable) and traverses several picturesque canyons with magnificent ocean, canyon, and mountain views, and at times becomes a single track. In a few sections of the trail, mountain bikes are not allowed in most of the trails that travel from Topanga, CA to Malibu Cyn Rd/Las Virgenes Cyn Rd in Calabasas, CA. I've not yet met anyone who has hiked/run/biked the entire length in one day, as the trail is very rugged and steep in some sections, with many major climbs and descents between the several different canyons from the PacPalisades to Malibu.If you're short on time, don't miss these parts of the Backbone Trail:- Munsch Trail/Topanga State Park: out and back with 26 different species of California wildflowers. No bikes. Best time to hike is Spring.- Fossil Trail/Hondo Canyon in Malibu: out and back with lots of fossils along the trail with spectacular ocean and canyon views. No bikes.- Backbone/Kanan Rd/Newton Canyon in Malibu: out and back over the T1 tunnel and climb up to Latigo Canyon, down and up to Corral Canyon with 8 seasonal stream crossings. Magnificent ocean, mountain, and canyon views. Nearly 100% single track. Best for bikers with at least intermediate skills and good cardio. Technical with exposure in some sections, elevation gain of 3,600 feet over 5 miles one way. The distance may be short, but the going is challenging after Latigo Canyon.- Encinal/Backbone/Encinal Canyon to Sandstone Peak in Malibu: this out and back trail has it all: single track, multi-use, and fire road. Probably the best ocean and mountain views of the entire Backbone Trail, plus a visit to the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains. Forever views of the valley. Best for bikers of at least high beginner level with some cardio fitness. 3 short, steep hills there and back again, but so worth it. Sighting of the Painted Lady Butterfly hatchings in early Spring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backbone310
50,Great hiking - watch out for snakes,I went hiking there last week. It is a mix of hills and plateaus but overall a good hike.Only advise here regards to snakes. On my hiking we had one right in the middle of the path. Be aware and be careful.We had two guys pulling her over and later called the authority responsible for animal control.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragdias
50,One of the best hikes in Southern Cali,"Pack plenty of water, sun screen, snacks, etc.This is just over 6 hrs round tripBest time to go is late Spring on a clear day but good year roundNot recommended for kidzEnjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heeuk
50,Rent a mt. bike from Topanga Creek Bicycles.,The backbone trail is about 60 miles in all. It can new traversed from Will Rogers park in Santa Monica to Point Mugu in Malibu.Rent a mt.bike from Topanga Creek bicycles and have a blast. It's a great way to see the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuLife
