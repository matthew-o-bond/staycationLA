50,Great trip to Kill Bill Church,"Fantastic place to visit, Oscar the host was fantastic, very interesting and couldn’t have been nicer to us. Took pictures and gave us very informative history chat on the church. Would recommend",David W
10,Extremely disappointed,"I drove my family out to see this iconic church, after a long drive we arrived to see a large truck blocking the front of the church which made it impossible to see anything! We decided to pull over to get a better view, no sooner the owner came out yelling and screaming at us, I have never been so scared at someone's behavior or embarrassed in my life. I will never go back and I recommend a drive by viewing. The owner is extremely unstable.",D. O'shea
40,Kill Bill Church,"One of my moms favorite movies, we decided to drive by on the way home from our road trip. The google maps had us going down a dirt road for quite awhile ( a little unnerving) Once we made it back to the paved road we saw it. There were many cars in the lot with a security guard at the doorway. There was a film crew renting the building & parking lot for a car commercial. The pastor of the church came to greet us. He is very friendly and gave us an overview/history of the building.",Sharon S
30,A little disappointed,Kill Bill is one of my families favorites!! So when we decided to take a road trip to LA of course we was going to make the trip out to see the church. I was extremely disappointed that a truck is parked in front where you can’t even see it. I can see a fence and all but a truck to obstruct the view was a real bummer for us all!,Carissawalker
30,Church needs work,"My wife and I drove out to the middle of nowhere to find The Kill Bill Church and once we arrived it was a little disappointing. The front of the church definitely needs some WORK, the paint is peeling, there's a broken down looking truck in front . The funny thing is there's a sign in the front window still giving a phone number to call if you want to use it in a movie shoot .The abandon store cross the street made for a better photo op. It is Interesting to see how things deteriorate over time .",Richard H
50,Movie history,"This was another place I really wanted to visit when coming to the Antelope Valley region. I remember the first time I saw the Kill Bill series and thinking I'd really want to visit the church in the second volume. Lo and behold I end up in Lancaster. I honestly never even knew this place was in Lancaster until I was here for a three night stay and decided to look up things to see or do in the area. Luckily, I found this place on TripAdvisor. While there isn't a lot to see here, if you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino movies, this is a must. It's a nice little church on its own too. Although, it's definitely more interesting more being the scene of a bloody shootout in a Tarantino movie.",Josh L
40,Worth a visit,If your ever in the area and have seen the movie its worth stopping by. Its just one of those things you can say I've been there and walked around the church!,925darleent
50,Great movie set location,"THis church is an actual real church, not just a movie location. Remote desert scenery and a great photo spot. Bring water with you just in case...No stores or anything else close by.",jillkelly777
50,Friendly and Accommodating,"We arranged a photo shoot at the Kill Bill Church with a vintage car. The owner was gracious and very accommodating during our interaction.The property is not usually available for this type of thing, so don't expect to be able to do it!The church itself is iconic for film fans, and worth a visit if you're in the area!",EZGruv
40,Extra Time on Our Hands,This was a fun afternoon after a tough morning meeting. We recognized the church from the film immediately and we weren't the only ones there.Not a bad drive at all!The Joshua tree standing next to it is holding up a lot better than the church though! Lol! :),TheBuick
40,Worth a Look,"There is never much to do on a Sunday afternoon in early Spring in the Antelope Valley. Getting to Alta Vista seems like it takes forever. You steadily go up a hill, rising up out of the valley and find this village of several small homes and compounds, the church, and an abandoned service station and restaurant. They parked a truck in front of the church I suppose to deter trespassed selfies or other unpermitted filming. The scale and proportions of this little church is neat. I love that Joshua tree. The church is functioning, so if you want to go inside, I believe you can on Saturdays, as it is a Seventh Day Adventist denomination.",David B
50,Exciting place worth a visit,"The church is abandoned since quite a while as it looks like. A truck seems to be parked permanently right in front of it which is a bit sad. Also you can’t go or even look inside. Nevertheless I loved going there. The surrounding area is awesomely remote and it looks indeed just like in the movies. I spend a good 20 min there and not a single other person was nowhere to be found. Not even a car drove by. If you like this kind of stuff, I highly recommend checking it out!",Femtosecond
40,Best wedding ever!,"Best wedding ever, we gave the bride a surprise to die for!Now in more seriousness, we drove from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and took a long detour just to visit this place, in the middle of nowhere. Unluckily there was a truck parked right in front, but we took some cool pictures anyway.",Antonio R
50,Interesting place to visit.,"My cousins were visiting from Texas some time ago and I knew one of them wanted to see the Kill Bill church so I hunted it down. It was only about 20 miles from us which made it simple. We were all impressed with the church but it just so happened when we got there on a Saturday afternoon, they had just dismissed the service and the minister was still there and he very happily gave us a great tour of the place telling us all about it. He was so pleasant and we enjoyed the visit. It really took us back in time. (the date says Jan 2017 but we visited in Oct 2015 but did not realize I could do a review on this place at the time.)",Geneva P
50,Highlight of my holiday,"Incredible sight; helps that I'm a massive Tarantino fan. We were the only ones there except for one passer by in their car. Surrounded by a barrier but looks invisible in photos.Opposite is a really cool abandoned garage, very picturesque.",beksltb
50,Visit to Quentin Tarantino Movie Church in Kill Bill,We went to the Kill Bill Church after we visited Saddleback Butte State Park. So the drive there did not seem as remote. Its less than a 1/2 hour drive from downtown Lancaster.When we got there a cute little dog in the neighborhood came out barking. Who's there?We visited the church. Its an active Sanctuary Adventist Church.Kill Bill is a two part movie. It was made by film director Quentin Tarantino.,mini
50,Kill Bill Church,"What a great place to check out! I was alone and it was deep in the Hills of Palmdale, Ca.I didnt go in because it was saturday, and the Adventist had services. I didnt want to interrupt.",LeapYearNora
50,Cool,"After taking the 30 minute drive from Palmdale, I enjoyed seeing the church! It was creepy being out there alone but it was an interesting drive thru the desert. The place across the street seem like it could have been in a movie but I'm not sure. There is totally nothing out there but homes here and there. I forgot my bottle of water so make sure if you take this adventure you take water and have a full tank of gas (didn't see any gas stations)!",frewhily
50,Two Pines Church,Two Pines Church in the movieReal life it's: Sanctuary Adventist ChurchProminent No trespassing signs combined with potential arrest or violenceIf you're a Tarrentino fan...ya gotta make the pilgrimage here,Summerasalifestyle
50,Looks just like all the pictures,"we checked the church out on a saturday and they had a service taking place while we were there. A church member greeted us with a smile and some literature. They are happy to welcome all visitors except those that use it as a movie set without permission. They invited us to take pictures of the church both inside and out and gave us a quick history lesson of the property. Turns out people from all over the world have come to visit this location, some have even had their wedding here. Its a cool place to see in person.",Cesar J
50,Awesome side trip... !!,Ive been meaning to come out here with my boyfriend we actually wathched kill bill 1&2 last night at our motel and had to visit!! Great experience deff will add to my memorie book!! And a plus it was an awesome drive and only a 30 min drive!!,Heidi D
50,Nice Day trip Bring your camera,"Have been meaning to visit for a while but was under the impression that it was closer to Pearblossom Hwy. It is accessible by going east on K or J, is a nice drive, not too many people on the way. There is no food or gas close by so come prepared. The landscape is beautiful with hills and valleys and buttes. A completely different view of the Antelope valley. The church itself is awesome to see in person but you are asked not too go inside or onto the property.",TanyaRussell_13
40,Awesome place to visit!,"I will definitely return for another visit of this classic landmark! Not only known for the filming of the Kill Bill movies by Quentin Tarantino, but is also famous for the filming of several music videos, commercials and other films as well.It is also still an actual church where many from all over the world come to worship! for proper information about this one of a kind desert attraction, go to www.thekillbillchurch.com",Jerry S
