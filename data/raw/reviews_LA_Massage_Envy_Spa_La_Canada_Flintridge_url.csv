40,Great place but hard to get Appointments.,"I really lime this place, clean, peaceful, easy parking but it is hard to get massage appointments when i want them. I hope they hire more massage therapists for evenings snd weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JACB5
50,THE Best!,Husband and I received gift certificates for birthdays - he had a massage and I had a facial - it was great - the spa is very very nice and the staff are so friendly - not pushy at all - great experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julial3054
50,Sorry,I haven't being there during this mont. I think it was about 6 months ago. But I had a good experience. Its very expensive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sergiomariob2016
50,Make my monthly appointments!!!,"I'm happy as a clam that I found this spa. It's much more reasonably priced than the fancy spa in Pasadena (BW) but they don't have a sauna or any amenties like that. Fine with me, I didn't use those anyway. Parking is easy and spa is clean and the staff is very friendly. Services are great and priced more reasonably.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroleD213
30,Confusing regular rates,"We tried this on a promotion and enjoyed it. But it was very unclear how to utilize the service again. They seem solely focused on signing up for monthly subscription type activity. For those of us who utilize these on a one-off basis, it was not made clear what the rates were after the promotion and not on a monthly program. Sadly we haven't gone back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BLTG
