10,Where’s the calamari?,Middle of summer/tourist season and 3 strikes for this location. 1) no calamari; (2) no white pita and the clincher was raw chicken. We “lived” w the no calamari and no pita but raw chicken was a deal breaker. The Manger was non chalant I guess their going out of business,celticbutterfly
30,Drive up Blue Jay Way if you can get by all the trucks!,Blue Jay was a great place to drive but now there is so much construction I would not go up there exept Sunday. As a realtor I have sold and leased properties there for years. It is said that the Beatles wrote the song there while renting a large house near the water tank. I heard this for the owner and I think it is true. Unfortunately everyone decided to build at once and now the street is barely passable with all the cranes and vehicles.,love2skiLosAngeles
40,Nice Neighborhood Hollywood - Blue Jay Way,We used to spend a lot of time on Blue Jay Way when my uncle and aunt lived there. Its a very nice neighborhood in Hollywood. It was always fun to go to their home for holidays and special occasions. We returned to remember the fun times we enjoyed there.,mini
30,The Bird Streets,"Being a local & having friends that live in ""The Bird Streets"" I've spent a lot of time up here. You're most likely to see, if not get run down by paparazzi before you actually see any stars. The homes that aren't covered in foliage are pretty, but the reality is this is just another rich neighborhood.",jgiorgianni
