40,Lots of fun,Brought some family from out of town and everyone loved it. We will be coming back for sure. The arcade was fun too. They changed up the games for laser and that was great. Nobody was bored playing the same game over and over. Just wish the games lasted a little longer but still fun.,Redman367
40,"Great experience but, out of date system","The experience is good for the first couple of visits for me and my family.Its more fun with 6+ players.3 team colors= Blue Green Red6 game modes= Elimination, Rabbit, Tomato, Tournament, CTF, and Protect the President.Equipment= Vest with attached GunSpecial abilities are= Shields and Photon cannon(rapid shot)Pretty SimpleOnly 4 down falls= Many of the players are the young, the game system/guns are out of date, and the place is not popularly known(therefore no challenges), and arena is fairly small and very restricted (2 ways in 2 ways out)(no top floor)And just to add some of the guns are not calibrated correctly but its not a big issue.Another issue is too, when you get hit and re-spawn there should be a restriction so you cant move, therefore you can't follow your killer around.A updated Game system with better guns/modes/safeguards would be a thumbs up, but its still fun to experience though.",Shong B
50,Birthday Party Fun,The grandson's attended a birthday party at this location. They enjoyed playing and had lots of fun. There is a small snack and beverage counter. I recommend taking your children and if you feel inspired join in the fun.,WMSCV
50,"GREAT SHOPS, MOVIES AND FOOD COURT","Such a nice mall. You can eat, buy an outfit, get a massage, get your nails done, see a movie and buy new shoes, all in walking distance!",Tracyandjjtravels
50,Great time for the whole family,I had a birthday party for my son (11) here and have come back several times now with my daughters (14). It's not always easy to find a place that keeps all of my kids entertained but this one does. I even find it lots of fun playing laser tag with them. There are also other games they can play. I would totally recommend this place!,judah d
50,Great Fun!,I've been to Valencia Laser Blast for 3 parties. I'm not sure who likes it better the kids or the adults!! It is so much fun! The best place for a party or event! Hats off to the staff for being so friendly and willing to make sure everyone is having a great time!Can't wait for the next time!,Tikigod77
50,A Blast for Adults and Kids!,Went with the family after the a day at Magic Mountain - used to Laser Tag in our area but this was awesome! The arena is really well laid out - so the games we played were more strategic then usual - which was great fun! Unlike other arenas they also let us play different types of games. The arcade was well lit with new games. Definitely recommend this as a place for family fun in the Santa Clarita Valley.,Ginny A
