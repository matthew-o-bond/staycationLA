40,“An interesting experience”,"I was based in Reykjavik and saw mostly around that area and the south east. I was impressed by the waterfalls especially, although the other sites such as the Volcanic craters, the Rift Valley where the Tectonic plates meet and Geysers with the hot spring were equally fascinating. There were so many interesting places to visit that I didn't have time to see them all, but there's always next time."
50,“Natural beauty surrounds you”,"The Iceland I saw which was Reykjavik and south east was amazing!! waterfalls, glaciers, ice bergs, mars like terrain, mountains and more. I would love to go back and see more"
40,“Between North America and Europe.”,"Reykjavik is a small city. As in the USA and Canada many people go to work by car and live in the suburbs. Still there is good public transportation and the center feels European. A big advantage of being small is that nature is never far away. Hike to mount Esja 911m (a city bus stops at the foot of the mountain) from where you have a marvelous view on the city and the bay area. On the down side: Iceland is very expensive, especially in July and August."
40,“Walking in the centre”,"the town is very small but it is very charming and full of big and cozy cafes where you can race breakfast or snack for lunch. excellent soups of the day, with meat or fish. Welcoming the local in the old port, side museum of the sea, fabulous fish and chips. Worth visiting the auditorium, the architecturally avant-garde. If you want you can take a hike to see the whales. Enjoy a soak in the warm waters of the Blue Lagoon, in any season and in any weather."
50,“amazing island”,"Scenery just fantastic Interesting history Stupendous waterfalls, volcanic craters and ice glaciers. Like nowhere else!"
50,“Go to Iceland it is fantastic. Been twice and we will be back.”,The Radisson Blu is a fantastic Hotel. The roads in Iceland are good quiet and very easy to drive on so hire a car everything is cheaper. You can do the golden triangle for the price of a gallon of petrol plus your entry fee to the Blue lagoon but you can stay there as long as you want. Get out of Reykjavik and eat in the boon docks. The food is fantastic and cheap and the little cafes are amazing. They speak little English but it does not matter as they just want tp please you.Go it alone you see some amazing places like a 6 kilometre tunnel.
40,“Dress for the cold”,"If walking around old town Reykjavik, dress for warmth. The wind is biting and it can get very cold, even in summer.The nightlife downtown usually starts around 11 p.m., we were told; we arrived in the area about 10 p.m . hoping for dinner. All the restaurants were either closed, or kitchen service ended. So eat before 9 p.m.Visit the Leif Eriiksson statue and Reykjavik Cathedral for photos... this is also a great place to park if you are driving, within easy downhill walk to the centre, and parking is free."
30,“Better see aurora for yourself”,Go to Iceland in winter if you want to see real aurora!You can see clearly even from city centre. Don't listen for those tourist traps (aurora trips and so on...). I've seen enormous aurora near Aurora Reykiavik (after visiting Vikin Museum).If you go in winter better check aurora predictions and don't waste money (it's expensive!) on some few minute long movie. Same movies (and timelapses) you can see in HD on Youtube or Vimeo. Eventually you can buy nice postcard here.
50,“fun stop”,good information and little gifts. really good desserts and coffee. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff are friendly. Picked up some brochures but im sure they give good advice if you ask
40,“friendly”,"Loved the people, the scenery and the Christmas atmosphere,There were one or two burger restaurants which weren't for us, but popular with families.Pleanty of lovely little restaurants.didnt try minky whale or puffin, stuck to the basics."
50,“Nicest people ever!”,"The country is different to anywhere I have ever been before, the people are genuinely the nicest people I've ever come across, it's clean and welcoming with the most fantastic natural features."
50,“Amazing place .. whatever the weather”,"Do not miss an opportunity to visit Iceland. Reykjavik centre is picturesque with an unbelievable harbour setting. Beautiful sunsets in October although quite cold and windy ... need to dress for Iceland! Golden circle is a fabulous day out ... drive yourself and enjoy some truly wonderful scenic experiences with high points like Gullfoss and Pingvellir. Even a short drive from the capital along route 42 there is an amazing lake at Kleifarvatn with black sandy shores and a little further south, Seltun offers a great bubbling mud and thermal walk.Drive to Skogafoss and visit the remarkable folk museum. Walk up beside the waterfall there and at the nearby Seljalandsfoss you can walk behind the waterfall ... a wonderful day in an amazing country."
50,“a unique nature country”,"A unique country, full of colors waterfalls rivers hot waters ice snow fjords..... A crazy weather..... but with open-minded and happy people.... Visit Iceland its a unique trip ....."
50,“Happy”,"Had 4 days away for my wife's 50th birthday and our Wedding Anniversary, Iceland was everything we thought it would be and more, a very magical place :)"
50,“diverse country”,"Iceland is a very diverse country with very different things too see including waterfalls geysirs,lava flows,black sand.volcanoes,glaciers etc.The people are very friendly and polite."
40,“Old town is beautiful”,"Quaint buildings, narrow streets, great coffee, wonderful skies and vistas of the harbour. Interesting Cathedral and best Danish pastries ever."
50,"“Self-walking tour in Reykjavik, Iceland”","Reykjavik is the capital city of Iceland. This summit city is claimed to be ""pollution free"" and financially rely on the fishing industry as one third of world's cod liver oil is manufacture here. This city is quite small and easy to tour around with a map (if you need one). The Sun Voyager Sculpture is the beautiful landmark along the seashore as a starting point and if you are lucky enough to come here at the time of sunset, then you will have a wonderful effect on your photo ""sculpture with pink-background"". Then you can stroll towards the new Harpa Concert Hall and pay a visit inside prior to walking to the commercial area with lots of food premises and nice structures including the City Hall near the Pond. After refilling yourself with seafood snacks,particularly lobsters, then proceed to the landmark of Hallgrimskirkja Lutheran Church (244 ft high) and the nearby streets with eye-catching colours wooden buildings for photo-taking. If you can spare half a day in the morning to join a ""whale watching"" sea trip from the Skarfabakki dock area, I guarantee you capable to take photos on puffins, dolphins and whales (humpback and minke) during the months from April to October each year but with a longer-ranged lense."
50,“Outstanding Iceland”,"Stayed in Reykjavik earlier this year and still find myself thinking of the trip and the primordial contact it offers for land and sky. Yep it is eye wateringly expensive but Wow air do good value flights from the Uk now which meant extortionate air fares were no longer a reason to stay away for me and thousands of others. The sites on the Golden Circle can get crowded but it is a must as you will see magnificent waterfalls, a geysir and a remarkable land formation that reflects tectonic activity. The land and sky are awesome from steam vents to magical and ephemeral (brutal occasionally) weather. I went on the monster truck experience as I was blown away by the places and wanted to get up close and personal to nature in the raw (albeit with a guide and on a tour). Truly awesome. The attempts to see the northern lights for a week were frustrating but if you go to Reykjavik harbour on a good night you might see them over the water as we did, People there can't help being eccentric and out there just like the place ....they can appear stand offish on casual aquaintance but if you stand in the High Street looking at a map I guarantee that someone will come and help you out while e.g giving you the reasons why chickens and horses are uniquely clean and bred there. A unique place that is unforgetable and will keep calling you back as soon as your bank balance recovers. Go and experience."
50,“11 hour layover”,"Greetings to all. I recently had an 11 hour layover in Iceland. From advise here I decided to take the flybus into Reykjavik and visit as many bars as possible (while still maintaining a measure of composure of course). The allnighter was a blast! Bar 11, Celtic cross, (which really wasn't very Celtic @ the time), a few others and finished off @ kiki queer bar. Some dancing with the young folk, almost everyone spoke English, very fun indeed! Twilight was as dark as it got and actually light by 3 am. sunrise @ 4;15 and pizza @ 5. Returned to the airport around 6:30, about to go thru security and do some shopping for my daughters, when I discovered my passport was missing!Panic set in, went to fi info was routed to customs police who were extremely helpful. The cab company also put out the word. My fear wasn't that it was stolen but I simply lost it. The plan was they were going to contact the us embassy, verify my identity and permit me to leave on a later flight. While lamenting my egregious gaff I was informed they found my passport!!!! I was so relieved and so very pleased.I am indeed very fortunate. I cant thank the Reykjavik police and customs enough for their diligence and kindness. ( I was told this happens often) as well Iceland air for not charging me the change flight. Everyone I encountered was considerate and professional. I highly recommend a trip to Iceland, whether overnight or over the week.Oh and do hang on to your passport. Thanks for reading."
20,“DULL UNIMPOSING CITY”,"Reykjavik has to be the most uninteresting capital city I have ever visited, it was lifeless dirty and everything seemed grey"
50,“4 days total was just enough to see Reykjavik area.”,"Always out by 0830. This was enough to see the south west corner which unless you are into hiking or other activities covers it for most. North of island roads closed anyway.Blue Lagoon tour, expensive (But has to be done) at 36 Euros entrance plus coach travel.Bring own towel or hire.Golden Circle Tour. We did the smaller 6 hour one which lasted 10 hours! Gained a real flavour of the area, geysers, waterfalls and much more.Northern Lights tours x2 ( Don't be disappointed if you don't see them. Lights not as co-operative as one might expect. You get a free 2nd trip the next night if unlucky and you book at your hotel as soon as you get back).Walk around the city. Catherdal Tower a fantastic view. Opera house inside worth a visit. Lots of interesting shops.In March needed all our layers and face coverings when the wind picked up and for Northern Light Tour. 25mph wind speed trebles the temperature downwards. Wine very expensive. Beer sensible ish. Eating out not the cheapest but always good quality so ask the friendly locals for advice. Stuffed puffin can be on the menu !"
50,“Public buses”,"We bought a day bus pass and travelled to many venues throughout the city, for 900 isk each, (about £5). Great value, for a full 24hrs. The buses are fast, run about every15 mins., to everywhere! A super system of 'hubs', allows bus routes to connect with each other across the city. Get a map and timetable from your hotel, it's good fun, too."
40,“Walk-about”,"We put on our coats and wander the ups and down in and outs of Reykjavik,the walking was so relaxing my wife and I felt so at ease.Day or night enjoyable and free."
50,“Hire a 4x4 in winter”,"So pleased that we hired a 4x4 and ventured out on our own steam as we love being out in the countryside and seeing the raw, real, beautifully breathtaking Iceland and all it has to offer. we drove 100 miles north up to Grundarfjörður to see the orca whales AND we were not disappointed. They were truly magnificent, to see them in their natural habitat was an honour we will never forget. The weather changes as do the road conditions when you go up over the mountain roads and if we had not had the 4 wheel drive car we would have got stuck or been worried about getting stuck. we hired a car from Icerental 4x4 and it was very reasonable at £55 per day, the reason they are a lot cheaper then other companies is because they are a new company setting up and are trying to grow the business. the car was in good nick and had winter tyres and road studs on. They were very helpful and very nice. the car was dropped off at the hotel and collected from the hotel."
50,“Absolutely wonderful experience with Iceland Unlimited tour company!”,"I just returned from a 9 day self guided trip around the Snaeffellsnes peninsula and Southern Iceland with my two sisters. After floundering around on planning -and I am no neophyte traveller- I decided to get help and luckily found this fantastic company. they responded immediately to my inquiries and quickly developed an itinerary to meet our time and energy requirements. They booked the hotels and car, and all we had to do was show up at the airport. i have to say it was one of the best vacations ever since the woman with whom we worked planned for every contingency. Christina was prompt to respond, friendly and full of helpful ideas to make our trip stress free. I can't say enough about this company, and would highly recommend them to anyone considering a trip to this beautiful country. The activities she suggested made the trip even more fun...the glacier walk was a new experience, as was the zodiac boat trip among the icebergs and even the whale watching...I haven't had this much fun in years."
50,“Perfect in every way”,"We'd done the typical European City breaks so wanted something different for our honeymoon, so Reykjavik it was.We were there mid-summer so the sun never sets, which takes a bit of getting used to, although it does add to the extremely safe night-time atmosphere.What a wonderful city; we stayed in Castle House luxury apartments on the town pond (the name made us laugh as its a beautiful lake surrounded by colourful houses!) which is no more than 5 minutes gentle stroll from Reykjavik centre. For the less mobile, half of the city centre is set on pretty hilly roads although there are great coffee shops for regular stops.Shopping and eating out are special; restaurants have a reputation for being expensive, but there is a very good reason for that - they are extremely good with beautiful freshly cooked food and excellent service. You wont find mass produced pub food here, you will find some truly excellent restaurants and bistros; we payed, typically about £75 for a 3 course dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine; you would pay at least that in the UK for comparable quality and probably worse service. Seafood (especially cod, salmon and Lobster) are specialities as is lamb, which was exquisiteTrips around the island are a must if you have the time with the Golden Circle a must. We had heard reports that the Blue Lagoon was a bit touristy but found it not to be the case at all; what was there was an incredible mineral rich geo-thermal pool, surrounded by excellent spa facilities. Loved it.Whale watching was a good half day out if seeing Minke whales and rare dolphins is your thing.Despite being mid-summer day temperatures are 10 - 14c although we only felt cold when out at sea when it really was layers, waterproofs and woolly hats.A mention for the Icelandic people who have a laid back efficiency about them which was a delight to see. Service was good and often accompanied by a lovely dry sense of humour.We got to chat with a local in a bistro on our first evening; he said his goodbyes only to return, almost apologetically, 10 minutes later with a wedding gift of a book of photographs of Iceland for us - wished us well and off he went. Where else would you get that???Loved every minute there and cant wait to see the rest of the island when we get chance to go back."
50,"“Magnificent, awesome city and country!”","We spent 7 days in Reykjavik from June 7 to June 13. After reading reviews on TA we decided to book tours instead of renting a car. We tentatively planned four tours with thoughts of renting a car or flying to Akureyri if we got bored in Reykjavik. That never happened!First, thanks to Gummi of GTI tours, our trip was wonderful. I will post another review of GTI. This review is about Reykjavik.We are a mature couple who enjoy walking and experiencing activities of the people that live in the country we are visiting.We did not go to any museums. We walked alot even though the wind sometimes made it quite challenging. In addition to the main shopping street we walked along Tjornin Pond, a beautiful area. We walked from town to the southern coast., along the water to Nautholsvik Geothermal Beach. This was a long walk. A city bus is available. The beach is small, quiet, a lovely Icelandic experience. After enjoying the warm pool, we took the bus back to town. We noticed along the way that we had walked most of the area and felt wonderful that we saw so much of Reykjavik. In town, we ate at Cafe Paris and sat behind the restaurant near the square (park). Tourists, Icelanders, adults and children eating,playing and loving the extended daylight in the park.Another day in Reykjavik we walked/bus to Laugardalur Park. We relaxed in the swimming pool, a warm pool,different than the Geothermal Beach. Not many, if any tourists there either. After a couple of hours, we walked 30/40 minutes to the Kringlan mall, walking through a different area of Reykjavik. We ate dinner and of course had plenty of delicious ice cream, did some shopping and saw a movie. Took the bus right back to our hotel. It was 9PM when we returned. The day flew by.We are from NY and the small city experience of Reykjavik was wonderful. It is easy to walk and take the city bus. The beach was free, nominal charge for a locker. The pool was inexpensive. If you have the time we recommend walking, takiing the city bus and exploring some of these places."
50,“What an amazing city!”,"It was actually my trip to Iceland which inspired me to finally write a review. I have been visiting countries with old university friends for a few years now and we never fail to have a good time. However, after having visited this spectacular island, with unbelievable nature and a city which feels like home from day 1, I just had to say something. I really think it's a shame that Iceland has been getting poor publicity due to their financial crisis, but i encourage everyone who gets the chance, to go.On our first day we explored Reykjavik which was a lot of fun. We walked to the harbour and tried the lobster soup at the Sea Baron, which I had read many good things about. Afterwards we went whale watching, followed by renting scooters. All in all, brilliant day! Later that evening we hit the local pub, The English Pub, cliché I know, there we met a bunch of locals and spun their wheel of fortune.On Friday we had a whole day of touring, we went with a Super Jeep company called Mountain Taxi for the ""Iceland in a Nutshell"" tour, which was absolutely brilliant, we were blown away by the landscape.http://www.mntxi.com/DAY_TOUR_Iceland_in_a_Nutshell.htmlFriday night we hit the town, and although a lot of fun, we decided to take our hotels advice and book a guide for Saturday.Saturday the guys and I went hiking through Skogar, but the journey was cut short after Mike dropped his camera into the waterfall.We went for dinner at Fish Company which was arranged by our night life guide, the food there is excellent.http://www.fishcompany.is/After dinner we met our guide Sara, who was not only cute but a lot of fun. She really gave as an experience we will never forget. Sara knew where all the best places were and got us in VIP, without any hassle, everytime! We ventured to bars we would never have thought to check out, she introduced us to a bunch of locals and kept us on our toes with the shots.www.FoamScope.comIt really is great to party in a unfamiliar city with someone who knows it so well. And we will definitely stay in contact with her and FoamScope for our next visit, I recommend others do too!Sunday, we were flying home, but managed to wake up in good time to check out the Blue Lagoon before checking in. I would say that after a long night of drinking, it is the best cure. We were left very relaxed for our journey home.http://www.bluelagoon.is/I had such a great holiday in Iceland, I just wish I could have spent more time there. If you are thinking of going there, I hope some of the recommendations help."
50,“5 days in Iceland”,"We visited Reykjavik in febuary, we stayed at the Hilton Nordica, which we found very comfortable, the service we recieved was very good, the Restaurant and the Bistro are to be recommended. During our stay we took several good excursions, walking on a glacier is an experience never to be forgotten. We took a day out to the west peninsula with Volcano Tours in a 4X4,(well worth the extra over a bus trip) very friendly and obliging, all in all we had a totally fantastic day. We shall definately be returning, wish had gone for longer!"
50,"“Cafe Babalu...cozy, cozy, cozy”","Cozy, like your living room, Bohemian, coffee, tea, homemade goodies, glass of wine, game of scrabble, beer, GREAT music, friendly smiles....shall I go on??? Please go here!! It was my favorite!"
50,“Great and huge new experience”,"I have just returned 3 days ago from Reykjavik, Iceland. Everybody was not believing me when I told them my next destination. I am an addict traveller woman (55 years old) travelling by myself. It is a safe, clean and beautiful city, different from any other European's country. The weather is more unpredictable than UK, I was very impressive about it. In half an hour I walked through heavy rain, light rain, sun, snow in different shapes ...The food is very tasty since a single soap of the day, hot dog (the best one of the world) to the sophisticated dishes.It is a welcome kid country, places are for families and kids, activities envolve all family. The hot swimming pools are fantastic, with tubes for fun and there are in each neighborhood.SPAs are wonderfull, with high technology, nice design, several options of fragant environment. We left the SPA with the mind relaxed and up.I strongly recommend the Golden Circle Tour: agressive and gentle nature. You visit National Park with Geysirs, Gullfoss Waterfall and Blue Lagoon.It is a destiny that I could go back and explore other regions or other season (they have just winter or summer)."
30,"“Great Location, Good value”","I have recently stayed 3 nights at Leifur Eriksson hotel as part of the Iceland Air package. Location of the hotel is excellent, just outside hallgrimskirkja (landmark church seen from everywhere in the city) and 5 mins walk to the main shopping street Laugavegur. There’s a small supermarket around the corner which was handy. Laugavegur is good for eating as there are many good value cafes.Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Single room was simple and small. Radiator in the room kept the room warm. Bathroom was also tiny but it’s quite normal in Northern European hotels.Breakfast included in the rate was good. Cold meat, bread, cereal and biscuits were offered. Could make your own waffle but the queue for one waffle maker was always long. Liked having cold/hot drink facility available all day.Overall, the hotel offered a good value & excellent location."
50,“great and friendly city”,"reykjavik was a great place to see for us. although the city has just about 300.000 peoples, it is an busy and vibrant city. it is the capital of iceland. there are a lot of interesting things to see, for example the ice bar was great!in the evening we are surprised about the high standard night live and the large choice of bars and clubs!!!"
50,“Reykjavik”,"I've been to Reykjavik twice, and had a great time on both trips. The city is small enough to walk all around, but large enough to keep you busy with a variety of activities: shopping, food, sights, relaxation."
50,“Quaint city with a huge heart!”,"This was my 2nd visit, last time I was there I visited the incredible natural wonders outside of Reykjavik - spectacular waterfalls, geysirs, sulfer pools, and of course volcanos and glaciers - truly breathtaking stuff!This time I wanted to explore Reykjavik, and what a beautiful city it is. Coming from somewhere with 30 times the population (Toronto) I was pleasantly surprised at all this city had to offer: great food (whether your on or budget or not), beautiful scenery, history, architecture, and all of it pretty much within walking distance. Most people over the age of 15 speak English very well and are always helpful to the wayward traveller.I was only there for 8 days, the first 2 days staying with friends in Hafnarfjordur. It's a great little town about 20 minutes outside of Reykjavik and it's been built almost entirely on top of lava fields! City buses into Reykjavik run very frequently and are inexpensive.Moved to a flat in the 101, Reykjavik's downtown core. The main street has everything you need - shopping, restaurants, bars, even casinos. Everything has that unique Icelandic twist to it. Whether it's that gorgeous wool sweater or yummy pylsur (hot dogs like you've never tasted before), the unique Icelandic style and flavour captivated me.The last 4 days of my trip were taken up with Iceland Airwaves - 252 bands in 5 days and almost all of them were Icelandic! The passion and support that Icelanders show their homegrown musicians is truly awe inspiring. Everyone cheers, dances and sings along - whether the band is singing in Icelandic, English or Danish. I saw everything from punk rock to hip hop to reggae; all the different styles morffed to put that special Icelandic spin on it. It's the 2nd biggest party of the year (after New Year's Eve which I was told is unbelievable) and I know I'll be back!Surrounded by the ocean this place is a little slice of heaven for, although it is cold there many months of the year, they have terrific heated public swimming pools that you can use for a nominal fee (less than $4.00 per person). People who live there ""go for a soak"" and catch up with friends and family in the hot tubs that most of the pools have. It's a social event!I've been before and I'll go again. Reykjavik is awesome!"
40,“Reykjavik & surrounding area”,"Just returned from my first visit to Reykjavik, Iceland. Always wanted to visit the Island and was not disappointed. The city was clean and had much to offer. We stayed just outside of the main shopping area but it was a short walk to get there. The shops were interesting and plentiful and the people very helpful. Most people spoke English -which was good as we do not speak Icelandic. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful as were the people at the tourist branches. We were able to book a trip to Videy to see the Peace Light ceremony 10/9 at short notice as well as flybus reservations. The city had much to offer in the way of sights, restaurants and coffee shops. Unfortunately we were only there for a few days and not able to see the museums and other historical sights. We did travel to the geysers, geothermal fields, Gullfoss waterfall and Pingvellir National Park. All very interesting and worth it. The Blue Lagoon spa was a highlight of our trip..a nice relaxing day."
50,“What a perfect country”,"I can't think of a vacation I have enjoyed more in a long time and I travel quite frequently. There are so many adventures to be had and everything is so organized and efficient. Everyone speaks flawless English, everyone is polite and helpful and the drivers - oh my - the most polite I have ever encountered anywhere. If you are even thinking about crossing the road they stop and patiently wait for you. Everything is clean and well cared for and again - the efficiency - everything just runs like clockwork. The tour operators are the best anywhere and there are just so many different types of adventures it is hard to fit them all in. Highly recommended."
50,“Reykjavik: Little City in a Immensely Gorgeous Country”,"My brother and I traveled to Reykjavik in August 2010 and had simply the most magical time. The other-worldly terrain and home-grown unspoiled-ness of the country make for a terrific week. We recommend staying in Reykjavik for a few days, but it is really not much more than a small city. Your best bet is to rent a car and explore the hundreds of things there are to see in Iceland!"
10,“WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT”,"we had great expectations of Iceland and Reykjavik in particular however we found Icelands capital rather shabby and not very appealing. The Harbour resembles a SCRAP YARD full of Scrap boats and rusted metal, There was a film of oil and general waste floating on the water in the harbour. There are NO harbour bars / cafes viewing areas or infact ANY kind of tourist area. There are industrial units on the Harbour wall and the overall impression is very POOR. Not a place to visit at all infact one to avoid The city has more than its share of drunks and dropouts sat around surrounded by beer cans and bottles who dont think twice about vomitting in the Street. The streets are generally clean but there grot spots. The Icelandics are not the warmest of people and generally very stand offish. The hotel we stayed at the CENTRUM was excellent though and did make up for the disappointment of the city. If you are planning a trip dont have great expectations and do have LOTS of money it is VERY VERY expensive BUT disappointingly not worth its cost.Get out and about and again apart from the excessive cost its not too bad"
50,“Best coffee in Iceland!”,Go to Babalu in Skolavordustigur just down the hill from the hallgrimskirkja (the big church) for great coffee and atmosphere and friendly staff. Also Cafe Gardurinn a small vegetarian cafe in Klapparstigur where they serve very tasty and reasonably priced (not easy to find in Iceland) meals!
50,“Quick Reykjavik”,"The plan: 3 night stopover to explore Iceland. Arriving 6h30am from North America, take the comprehensive all day Arctic Circle bus tour, visiting the beautiful lake where the world´s first parliament met, geysers, a waterfall and even a geothermal power plant. Iceland expert in a day. The hotel: Fosshotel Baron, downtown 50 euros per room, per night with breakfast. 10 minutes walk to the main square. Day 2 Reykjavik on foot. City founding museum, Althing parliament. Excellent local fish dinner at Einar Ben traditional restaurant, main square 45 Euros per person with wine. Day 3 Minke whale and dolphin watching cruise. 45 Euros per person. Dozens of whales showing their tails. Superb local fish dinner at the modern Fishmarket restaurant 55 euros per person with wine. 20 Euros fly bus transfer to the airport."
40,“very nice but very expensive”,"stayed for a week in reykjavik in september and found it to be quite a nice city but very very expensive. we spent a day or two wondering around the shops bars and restaurants and have to say it is really expensive. after walking around the main shopping district the cheapest we found we could eat out was 15 pounds per head and that was just for a main course. a small bottle of beer cost me 6 pounds.there are a few small museums to visit and a couple of half decent shopping malls (again very expensive) but you really have to go out on day trips to keep yourself occupied. we done whale watching from reykjavik harbour in a nice fair size boat called the andrea. managed to see a few minke whales. this cost us about 30 pounds each. we also went to the blue lagoon which was another 30 pounds each. and we done the famous golden circle which was about 80 pounds each. all very good days out but not cheap. never got to see northern lights as it was always to cloudy.found the restaurant menus rather strange ie smoked puffin minke whale pepper steaks, deer, and wood pigeon. we didnt try any of these as we went to iceland to watch the whales not eat them.personally a week i think is to long so if your going to go 3 or 4 nights is probably long enough."
30,“Capital City of Iceland”,"This is a city with a difference in that it does not feel like a capital at all - more like any ordinary city, but with quirks - the overall look is somewhat grey, but with colourful roofs and buildings intermingled - it is concrete and steel construction with some very deprived looking building and graffiti but unlike 'run-down' aspects of other cities there is zero sense of malice, danger or intimidation - it actually feels fairly safe at all timesEven the church is a concrete and modern structure, and it looks much more charming when close up than in photographs - this is the same for most of Reykjavik - a lively yet calm city. The overall ambience I would liken it to is a school trip where the teachers let their hair down - there is fun, but you get the sense it would never really loosen up fully or get out of handIf you want to relax in a big place with plenty to offer, I would recommend Reykjavik - safe option city"
40,“Stay one day and start a tour”,"The capital of Iceland is a nice place to stay for one day and perfect to start a tour over the country. Nice pond in the city centre, exibition in the city hall, artificial geysir and believe me or not heated sea in the summer! If you have only a day or two a mus see is one day golden circle excursion, Enought time to return to the city in the evening. If you have more just rent a car and start a tour over Iceland."
50,“Reykjavík 101”,"At the end of July 2010, my husband and I visited friends in Reykjavík, who showed us the town and drove us on an amazing tour around the country. Reykjavík is a lovely town with a very *northern* feel, yet cosmopolitan and trendy despite being tucked away on an island at the very top of Europe. Iceland itself is not to be missed, but if you only have a few days, Reykjavík is definitely worth a visit. Iceland Air, by the way, will allow you to stop a few days here for free—think about it you transatlantic voyagers! Below I would like to recommend some sights and restaurants I especially enjoyed.Tip #1: Simply walk around—the town is small, very user-friendly, and lovely!Tip #2: Enjoy the many coffee houses, with delicious desserts, especially the Icelandic pancakes and skyr desserts. Well, skyr itself is simply delicious and you must try it! It’s a thick yogurt similar to quark, with lots of proteins and calcium but low in fat. “Siggi’s skyr” is sold at Whole Foods in the US, by the way.Tip #3: I enjoyed the Cathedral and I especially loved Skólavörðustígur, the street walking down hill from the cathedral, with lots of nice galleries and unique stores.Tip #4: On Saturdays and Sundays, in a warehouse by the port, just behind the Art Museum, there is a used market called Kolaportið, where you can find anything from handmade lava jewelry to fermented shark to cheap sunglasses made in China.Tip #5: Walk along the Hólavallagarður cemetery (know as “the cemetery by Suðurgata” or “kirkjugarðurinn við Suðurgötu”), which was open from 1838 until 1932, when it was fully allocated. This is the cemetery next to Brekkukot, in Nobel Prize winning author Halldór Laxness’ THE FISH CAN SING. Those unfamiliar with the book will appreciate that many important people in Icelandic history are buried here, including Jón Sigurðsson, the independence hero born on June 17, 1811 (the Icelandic National Day is now June 17). I was fascinated by all the beautiful Icelandic names and found out that to hold an Icelandic passport you need an Icelandic name, hence the tradition is preserved. Just beneath the cemetery, in the water, is City Hall, opened in 1992. The building was quite controversial at the time, both because of its location and its modern look of it. Definitely interesting.Tip #6: Good & warm lunch place, with nice art: Cafe Paris, right in front of the Parliament across Austurvöllur Square (great salmon bagel!)Tip #7: Great pizza @ Eldsmiðjan on Laugarvegur.Tip #8: Amazing, amazing Icelandic sea food @ Þrír Frakkar (The Three Coats), including smoked char, creamed fish soup, whale sashimi, grilled fillet of halibut with wasabi mashed potatoes, and plaice fillet with shrimp gratin. Make sure you make reservations because the place is small and very popular. It’s worth it!Check out my blog, ""view da la lòbbia"", for more about Reykjavik and the rest of the country! www.ndb-agency.ch/blog"
50,“My Guide to Iceland”,"I led a groupof graduate students to Iceland this summer and this was a guide I sent them beforehand....1. Voltage in Iceland is 220-240 Volts. The US is 110. If you are bringing something that needs to be plugged in make sure you have a convertor and a adapter. Most cell phone/camera chargers have built in convertors so no convertor is needed just a plug adapter.2. Current Exchange Rate: as of 7/13 the rate is 123 ISK/US Dollar.3. Credit Card Usage: Iceland is a very credit card friendly country. They can be used in almost any situation from fast food to cabs. Check with your card company to see if they charge a foreign transaction fee (most cards do) If you have time try and get a Capital One Card as they don’t charge foreign transaction fees.4. Tipping policy in Iceland: Service and VAT are invariably included in prices in Iceland and tipping is never required. However, if you are very pleased with provided service, Icelanders are generally not offended if they are offered a tip.5. Water: Tap water is safe to drink in Iceland and it is one of the countries with cleanest water in the world.6. Prices in Iceland: While all of our activities and some of our meals are included you will need to bring some spending money. Prices are close to NYC prices except for alcohol (more on that later) You know yourself better than we do so plan accordingly. See below for an estimate of prices of some common goods in Iceland (not sure when this list was made so prices might have risen) :Water at bars, restaurants and cafés: FreeMilk, 1 litre: 150 ISKCoca-Cola ½ litre: 200 - 300 ISKEspresso: 300 ISKHot dog: 200 - 300 ISK1 kg cheese: 1, 300 ISK1 kg smoked salmon: 1,700 ISK1 L orange juice: 200 ISKA loaf of bread: 225 - 300 ISK½ litre beer at a restaurant or bar: 500 - 900 ISKWine, glass/bottle: 950/3,500 ISKEntrance to nightclubs: Free – 1,000 ISKLunch at a restaurant: 1,300 – 1,800 ISKDinner at a restaurant: 1,800 – 5,000 ISKPublic bus ticket: 280 ISKAccess to public swimming pool: 360 ISK7. Time: Iceland is on Greenwich Mean Time all year around. At 12 noon in Iceland the time is:City TimeAustin 6:00 amNew York 7:00 amLos Angeles 4:00 am8. Language: Almost everyone in Iceland speaks English, don’t worry too much about learning the language. Here are some basics to make things go a little smoother:9. Sunlight: Bring your sunglasses / eye masks – estimated Sunset while we are there is around 11pm with sunrise occurring around 3:30am.10. Alcohol: If you are planning on having a few drinks at night it could get quite expensive compared to even the most expensive cities in the US. There is a duty free store for arriving passengers where they can buy cheap alcohol (at least cheap compared to the rest of Iceland). To find the duty free store just follow the Icelanders. No Icelander in their right mind will pass the duty free store upon arrival. Do not exceed the allowance which is 1L of liquor and 1L light wine (less than 22%) or 1L liquor and 6L of beer. The liquor can be exchanged for either 1L light wine or 6L beer. The local Icelandic drink is called Brennivín and also known as the ""Black death” A better choice might be the local vodka called Reyka.11. Restaurants: Traditional Icelandic food can be quite disturbing with items like fermented shark, sheep’s head, lamb testicals, head cheese, liver sausage, wind dried fish and blood pudding. Luckily most Icelanders only eat these for special occasions and I only plan on eating these after a strong challenge to my man hood and probably a few adult beverages. Quite a few restaurants will have puffin, whale and even Rudolph on the menu so be prepared and try not to be offended. Most food that you will probably have in Iceland will actually be quite good. They are most well known for their fresh fish and lamb dishes.Here are some of my favorite restaurants from the last time I was there:Saegreifinn / The Sea Baron – Famous for their lobster soup, a must try. Cheap.Icelandic Fish and Chips – Probably some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. Very fresh and they serve it with a homemade tartar sauce made from Icelandic yogurt(skyr). Relatively Cheap.Indian Mango – You’re probably thinking Indian food in Iceland, this can’t be right. Very good if not the best Indian food I have ever had. Somewhat expensive.Laekjarbrekka – We are having one of our included group dinners here. Will probably be the nicest place we eat in Iceland. Expensive.Thrir Frakkar – Translates to 3 coats. Another very nice restaurant with a nice price tag to match. Mostly known for their seafood dishes. Expensive.Baejarins Bestu Pyslur – Translates to town’s best hot dog. From what I remember the name holds up. Ask for one with everything on it as a local would. Good late night option. Cheap.American style fast food – While McDonalds was driven out of Iceland a few months ago(yea!) you will find a KFC, Pizza hut, Dominos, Quizno’s and a Subway there in case you get homesick. The first one that goes into any of these restaurants has to buy everyone a drink. j/k12. Bars/ Clubs: As you may know Iceland has quite the reputation for its nightlife. Most nightlife places don’t get started around 12am as most Icelanders do a bit of pre gaming before coming out. One of the most famous places is called Kaffibarinn has some very long lines and was featured in the movie “101 Reykjavik”. If you have some time I highly recommend watching this movie before we go as it gives a taste of what to expect in Iceland. It’s quite a strange movie so consider yourself warned! Other places are NASA (big techno-ish club) B5 (trendier/loungish place) Almost all of these bars and a bunch of other ones are on one street and our hotel will be just a short walk away."
40,“Reykjavík - perfect starting point to visit Iceland”,"To get to know Iceland it is advisable to stay in the vicinity of the capital city Reykjavík. It is the perfect starting point to visit the country’s main attractions. With a hired car one can undertake day trips to the continental divide, the spectacular Strokkur geyser as well as to the Gulfoss waterfall. Generally we would advise you to hire a cross-country vehicle with four-wheel drive as the country only has 50 kilometres of motorway and mainly of the roads are not fully asphalted. Furthermore very often small streams cross the road and many routes go over glaciers. It is really exciting!Each season has its own charming atmosphere and the Fire Island holds an array of surprises for visitors. Because of the climatic conditions and the length of the days we would recommend you go to Iceland during the spring or summer time."
50,“Love Reykjavik!”,"Loved Reykjavik!For a fancy stay, Hotel Borg seems nice. For a nice, modern apartment, go with Apartment K. There's also a hostel right in the middle of the main street, for budget travelers..Some tips...- Things open late in the AM! None of the stores on the main strip are open before noon, so feel free to sleep in...- Lots of things are closed Sunday, too.- Around 7-9pm locals gather in the grassy area across from Hotel Borg to drink on the grass. Lots of fun - don't miss it! Nice way to meet other travelers.- Drinks aren't cheap. There's a liquor store in the middle of the main street. We stocked up on wine and vodka, then got some OJ at the 1011 (mini supermarket). We heard that locals drink with friends before going out and go out late - well after midnight, so we did that, too, at our place and saved some $...-The 'famous' Reykjavik nightlife we heard of seemed to be only on weekends. For a few nights we walked around searching for it, but couldn't find what we had heard about. On Thursday it sorta got going but things closed at 1am. Friday and Saturday go off - just don't expect that same vibe on weeknights.-We spent a halfday in the petting zoo/ kiddie amusement park/botanical garden - was nice to wander around a bit there...-Really liked 'Shalimar' a great Pakistani/Indian restaurant not far from Plaza Hotel on the main street. Super yummy naan and the veggie korma is the best I've had in a long time.- It is impossible to get a good sit down meal late in the evening. Most kitchens are closed by 10pm! After realizing this, we ate dinner all scruffy when we were dropped off after day tours. Eat, then go home, rest, and freshen up for the nightlife. If you expect dinner at 10, you'll be disappointed.- A Noestru Groesum, or whatever its called - the famous veggie place - is yummy. Ate there 3 times! Loved the sprouted bread they offer with the meal.- We liked Boston as a chill place to get a drink. Went to Bakkus but it was crazy loud. Kaffibarrin didn't live up to the hype in our experience. Best is to just walk along the main strip and see what's going off by yourself...There's a place that's a coffeehouse by day (forgot the name, but it looks like a little house) that was lotsa fun. Just talk to people on the street...We encountered weird street theatre, protests, impromptu street parties and art...a super vibrant city. Some waiters/people were cold and disinterested, but when we got the chance to talk to locals, most were so incredibly friendly and filled with a truly unique spark of liveliness that we found in people all over Iceland. It was a really great trip - hope you have a fun time there, too!"
50,"“Iceland - Beauty/Terror, Tranquility/Hostility”","I visited Iceland in June 2010. The focus of my visit was on the Sagas, the History and then to see as much as possible in the time I was there. Seven days and six full day tours was about I could fit into the time. Not really enough. It needs to be for longer.My tours were organised by Ingi, at TourIs, using Iceland Excursions as the provider of services for five of them.The drivers and guides and in particular, Erlingur, Matthias, Jon, and Gunnar were all extremely calm and informative individuals. Their English was exceptional.I would also like to compliment Iceland Excursions on a young man in reception. His calm and ever smiling face was a joy to behold. It was a pleasure to enter the office.My first tour was to Thorsmork, the place of Njal's Saga, and the site of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull. Ash was everywhere, but it was still beautiful. It must have been difficult for Erlingur, but he remained calm and interested. But I had a giggle to myself when he began to pick up Ash, and placing it small bags?A truly fascinating, and inspirational place to be. A good day.My second tour was the Golden Circle Classic. it did not hold my attention well. Although beautiful, the water falls inspirational, and so much water everywhere. The area with its Geysirs, and geothermal energy plants were interesting.Thingvellir, the place of the first Parliament is historically important to the people of Iceland. It is remote and peaceful. However the tour was spoiled by the number of tourists everywhere. The Lamb Soup for lunch was a highlight.Matthias was the guide for the Saga Trail and Borganes. This tour was extremely interesting. Matthias, although living and working in Iceland was German. He was extremely helpfull. At Snorrastofa, in Reykholt, Matthias knowing of my interests in the Sagas and the History of Iceland, arranged for me to meet Dagny, - a lovely lady who was both informative, helpful and interested. I told her of my enquiries and efforts to obtain the ""Book of Settlement"" - (Landnamabok) in English. She immediately produced a copy and suggested another book she had, that she thought would also interest me. The sale was made, and I came away with the ""greatest treasure"". The greater area is also the scene of Egil's saga. A really good day, with so many warm and wonderful peopleMy other tours were to Snaefellsnes and a cruise on Breidafjordur, and to the South Coast and Jokullsarlon a truly magnificent glacier lagoon. It was full of Icebergs. Jokullsarlon shows the unique and changing nature of Iceland. Great trips.The best tour for me, however was the day I went to Landmannalaugar by ""Super Jeep"" These jeeps are eye-openers. They are big. The guide, Ingi a man with a toughened looking exterior was really anything but that. He was indeed a softly spoken individual, with a most warm and gentle manner. He had the calmest of personalies to match., and was an absolute joy to be with and around.My biggest worry, was getting from the ground into the car. This seemed to amuse Ingi, and he produced a step.Landmannalaugar is just the most beautiful, rugged, inspirational place, I have ever been to, it could perhaps even be perceived as a little hostile. Such a wonderful day. An absolute must on any list of ""things to do"" but by jeep not by bus. It's so much funReykjavik - a fairly easy city to walk around. Hallgrimskirkja, Domkirkja, The National Museum were all on my agenda. The walk around the lake and the bird life is so relaxing, peaceful and inviting.Eating houses are plentiful. I tried several. Vegemot, was Ok, but noisy and always full. I found a little place called the Scandinavian. The food was great, the service good, and it was quiet. The portions were large.The Icelanders know how to party. My Hotel Skjaldbreid was on the main street and the nightly parties seem to start around 9.00pm and finish around 6.30am. Then the street cleaner turned up. I considered joining them when it became obvious to me that I could not beat them.The main street, great for shopping and getting rid of those Icelandic Krone. Can't change them and can't take them home, so the only option to ""spend them.""Some jewellery shops close by were happy to take them of my hands. I came home with some beautiful traditional Icelandic designs. I was happy.Iceland - a great place and I will need to go again - not finished yet.."
50,“Absolutely Awesome!!”,"The people there are very friendly and everyone can speak English. They are extremely helpful especially if they know you are visiting. You can walk in to a cafe or a slightly posh restaurant and both you will enjoy great food which is fresh and value for money. There are many attractions like the Golden Circle and Glacier lagoon where they filmed James Bond movies. I was a bit disappointed with the northern lights tour because I was there for 10 days and failed to have even one sighting. The Blue Lagoon is a must! It is near the Reykjavik international airport so plan to go there at the beginning or the end of your trip. In winter, if you are renting a car, be very careful about getting stuck in snow. The greatest thing is that their emergency number and police response were efficient and helpful! I absolutely enjoyed my time traveling around Iceland. I was lucky to be there for their Food and Fun Festival where famous chefs come to cook their signatures. That was awesome! I would definitely return to this new and awesome country!"
40,“Expensive. Glad we did it but not overly impressed.”,"Reykjavik is an interesting city. Iceland has some great trips - don't miss out on the Golden Circle your (Iceland Horizons recommended) and the Blue Lagoon. Reykjavik itself lacking much of interest for us. It is expensive but not so much as not to visit. The food is yummy and different. We went to the market near the harbour that is advised, it was like an old indoor car boot sale! The Hilton was fabulous. Def stay there. Bit of a walk but not too far. Pre-book your airport transfer online with Reykjavik Excursions. You need the transfer and it's cheaper to do it in advance. We did the Blue Lagoon with Netbus because they ran the cheapest tour that included entrance to the park (they keep you luggage whilst you are in the Lagoon) and then dropped us at the airport. Iceland Express were amazing. Couldn't be more helpful or friendly! Golden Circle a must but don't reserve lots of time for Reykjavik the coty itself..."
10,“Avoid Volcano in Action tour from Grayline Excursions”,"We booked a Volcano in Action Tour with Iceland Excursions.The vehicle that they used was entirely inappropriate for the rough terrain you have to cross. The attempts to traverse rivers and valleys in what was essentially a bus,yes a bus, actually seemed dangerous at some points.We saw several 4WD and huge 4x4 trucks turn back as they deemed it too risky to continue the journey,however our ""guide "" seemed to think it was not only safe but also quite amusing to continue.Do not consider doing this tour unless you can be sure the vehicle is suitable.I feel that disregard was shown for the safety of the passengers and would urge people to think seriously about booking this tour."
50,“One of the most beautiful places I have visited”,"We visited Reykjavik at the beggining of February 2010 for three days. I have to say it is one of the most unique, unusual yet truly beautiful cities in Europe I have ever been to.Iceland is one of THE most fascinating countries I have ever been to. It is an island full of contrasts and contradictions; from the lunar-like volcanic landscapes by the coast, to the breathtaking highlands further inland; the beautiful waterfall at Gullfoss surrounded by snow and ice, to the awesome erruptions of Strokkur at Geysir. There is one thing we noticed, that there are hardly any trees, which I found rather unusual.There is so much to see and do, and the beauty of it all, despite being known as a 'cold' country (depending where you're from and what you're used to) the majority of activities are centered around the outdoors, whether it be ski-dooing over the frozen glaciers, pony trekking through the countryside, or swimming outdoors in heated pools. This is especially surreal in sub-zero temperatures!!We managed to cram loads in during our short stay, and we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay. Had time or money not been an issue, we would have certainly stayed here for much longer.Thats the only slight downside, really. Everything seems so expensive compared to may other European places, but we already knew this before we came, and it IS classed a a Scandanavian country, so it is to be expected. That said, despite the high prices, we found everyhthing we paid for to be of good value. You definately cant come here on a tight budget, but if you come prepared and bring snacks for during the day, and take it steady, and put money aside for the main things you want to do, you will be fine. We worked hard for months and saved up in advance knowing we were coming here, and we quite easily managed with 80,000 isk between two of us, with enough left to buy a meal and a couple of touristy-souvenirs at the airport on the way back!The people are friendly and helpful, and most speak English well; they make an effort to help you out where possible, whether it be asking for directions or advice on things to do, times etc.We stayed at the Loftledir Hotel, situated right beside the city airport. The airport itself is quite small, with most flights being domestic and operating during the day, so you dont hear much nosie from the planes, as chances are you will be out for most of the day anyway, so it shouldnt be a problem.The hotel has many facilites and the rooms are clean, modern and practical, with tea and coffee making facilities, shower, toilet etc.There is a T.V with limited channels, but hey who goes to Iceland to watch the televsion anyway??We planned our day trips in advance before we went so as not to waste precious time while there.We did all the main things we wanted to, including the Golden Circle tour, which was fascinating, interesting and awe-inspiring all at once - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - and vsited the Blue Lagoon, which was a weird and wonderful experience, vey surreal, relaxing in hot thermal waters on a freezing February day.The weather was great while we were there which was definately a bonus, very cold of course, though nnot quite as I had expected, it was probbaly about the same in England at the same time we went, it was just the wind chill factor that made it seem much colder, probably as we were so close to the coast.We booked a Northern Lights tour, which on the first night was cancelled unfortuntely due to the weather - it became cloudy during the evening so viewing them wouldn't have been possible. Luckily the next night the sky was clear which is essential for viewing the northern lights, though still not guaranteed. We got on a coach full of other hopefull tourists from various hotels in the area, and drove into the night. The driver switched off all the lights and we were in complete darkness, it was fun and felt like a little advenure..We ended up at the Pingvellir National Park eventually where we waiting in the cold night, anxiuosly waiting to see if we would witness the amazing phenomena. We didnt see the full spectacle to our slight disapointment, but we DID see an unusual band of faint blue-ish light across the horizon: rather like a huge laser is the only way I can describe it. I was hoping for the dancing green lights but of course I knew that you cannot force nature and it wasnt meant to be that particular night. It was still fun thpgh, gazing up at all the stars in the clear night sky.We were still grateful to have caught even just a glimpse of the light, and its made me more determined to continue searching for them, I will see the whole show one day!Everywhere feels fresh and crispand clean, and there are virtually no other cars for miles, which we are simply not used to in Britain!The city of Reykjavik is rather small for a capital city, located on the south coast of the island but it is nonetheless beautiful, very trendy and cosmpopolitan and very compact, everything seems to be walking distance from each other. The buildings are quaint and pretty and look very cosy from the outside - they look like something straight out of a fairytale, all painted in bright, vivid hues of yellow, green and blue.Overall we found this a charming little place with plenty to offer and something for everyone, from organised day trips, retaraunts, national parks, museums, beautiful scenery and plenty of photo opportunites to remind you of what a wonderful little country you have visited.We would definately not hesitate to go back, possibly during the summer months next time to see the contrast and possibly experience the Midnight Sun."
50,"“Iceland,,What a surprise!”","The Trip to Iceland happened because of a great package offered by Iceland Air. Our trip far exceeded our expectations. I do believe much of this is due to the organized, efficient nature of the people themselves. This was first evident when arriving at the hotel at 8 in the morning. Our room was ready and so was our breakfast, which was “on the house”!We had the first day to explore Reykjavik, a small city with a pond and tidy houses sided with corrugated metal, as there are no indigenous trees except for some strange variety of birch. The cleanliness reminded us of our visit to Switzerland. We had a delightful lunch of fish. All the food was presented in an artful manner. The fish and water is some of the best in the world. We decided to tour the south countryside with Highlander Tours, a private licensed Tour company. Feel free to contact me for their address. Our guide Helgi, was amazing. English was among 5 or 6 languages he speaks well. He had a great understanding of history and geology. He also is quite an excellent photographer, often planning our stops for perfect lighting. We enjoyed Helgi’s company and knowledge for 3 days of exploration of the south coast in a comfortable Ford Excursion. The journey included fantastic views and invigorating walks. We enjoyed cascading waterfalls, black beaches, lava fields, isolated farms, Icelandic horses, an extensive museum, and the ultimate, Glacier Lagoon. It ranks with Iguazu Falls and the Grand Canyon for me in terms of natural wonders. When we were at the lagoon, huge hunks of glacier were floating in an almost frozen body of water enjoyed by over 100 seals. The colors were amazing . A short walk away was the black sand beach that was dappled with huge pieces of ice. At the lovely Hotel Laki, we bundled up at night to spot and attempt to photograph the Nothern Lights.The trip ended with another well organized trip to the airport which included a 3 hour stay at the Blue Lagoon. Another example of Icelandic hospitality and organization.Iceland is a trip worth making!"
50,“Warm greatings from the land of Ice”,"I have now been to Reykjavik to many times to count and have been a traveler and a guide, a visitor and a local...and I have come to love this City. It has the cosyness of a small town with its quiet corners and plases where you can enjoy stillness and to collect yourself and enjoy the beauty, and the action and coninence of a big city with shops that are open 24/7 and parties and activities for every type of person.I have hosted many people from around the world and as different personalities as they all are they each found something for them to enjoy.If you ever have any questions about where to go and what to do you can ask the person next to you. Everyone speaks Engish and you might just end up making a new friend because Icelandic people love showing of there countrie and might even guide you around...and if not, well just contact me."
50,“Just a great place”,"Right from getting off the plane, Reykjavik is very obviously quite orderly and organised.The ticket office is on the way out of the main building and so it seemed easier to travel by bus than taxi - very eco friendly, too.Then it all gets a bit special. When you get on the bus, you are asked where you are staying (if you have pre-arranged) and in a system like none I had experienced, you are taken to the bus station and then transferred to a smaller bus which takes you directly to your hotel. It runs incredibly smoothly and even on the odd occasion that someone got left behind, they would even arrange a small bus to catch up with the coach at some point along the way. The hotel was also happy to check if tours were running and arrange buses to and from places.This system works for day trips, tours and the airport and so I never used any other method of travel during my stay. The people in Reykjavik were very welcoming and friendly, the sight seeing is well managed, the food is good, their range of languages is unmatched and they are keen to ensure that your stay is comfortable and happy.It was less expensive than I had been led to believe (I guess due to the current exchange rate).I suppose it's quite small compared to most capital cities - but I was very impressed!!!"
50,“A magical place for all ages.”,"I travelled to Reykjavik during February half term. It was a great time of year for the weather and tourism - although if you would like to see whale watching you will need to consider later on in the year.Most hotels offer very reasonable trips to a number of places of interest for tourists. The Gulfoss Tour (Golden Waterfalls) are a must. This involves some walking so sensible shoes is adviseable. You will see some of the most beautiful snow landscapes and breathe in really fresh air.Geysers are another tourist visit to remember. This is a stunning place to experience. Whether you are a student, on a family outing, or on a romantic weekend this really is an amasing geological experience.Alcohol is expensive so would recomend packing a bottle safely in your suitcase."
50,“Iceland guided tour”,"I had a grant from Rhode Island School of Design to explore the relationship of climate change to the shape of the landscape. Iceland seemed to be an ideal venue. I have worked with the Yale School of Geology on other projects and asked for a recommendation of a guide. All sources gave me Bokur Hrolfsson, he proved to be an excellent guide, not only for information but also for access. Please note that you need help with information and proper vehicular access to reach areas that might be of interest. Please take seriously the warning in Iceland of what vehicle goes where.Borkur will guide you to where you would like to go along with interesting geological history and Icelandic lore...[--]"
50,“Great Time To Visit Iceland”,"Iceland is a country of about 300,000 residents, and Reykjavik - it's capital - feels more like a large seaside fishing village than a metropolitan hot spot. If you want hustle and bustle, go to Paris, London or Hong Kong. But if you are looking for a laid back destination with breathtaking natural wonders nearby, Reykjavik could be for you.Over the past decade, the city developed a reputation for its nightlife. Since last year's economic crash (Iceland has suffered more than any other economy from the global recession), you will find a much more subdued climate. The other thing you will find is bargains. Don't get me wrong, Iceland is not dirt cheap, but prices have reportedly plummeted since this time last year, which makes me wonder how expensive it must have been to travel there in the past. Shops along the city's main shopping street - Laugavegur - are offering discounts of up to 75 percent, so it's more affordable than ever to bring home some amazing Scandinavian design.I would highly recommend the free walking tour, which leaves daily from the tourist information office. The opinionated guide (who founded this tour and a ghost tour) will tell you everything you need to know about the history of the city, as well as it's current troubles. He also gives some great tips on places to eat, shop, visit, etc. One suggestion he made that was dead on was to visit the Red Cross Thrift Shop if you want a bargain on Icelandic sweaters. My traveling companion and I found great deals and also had an experience that most tourists never get! Our guide also told us that to experience the real Reykjavik, you should visit one of the city's many pools. Fed by geothermal springs, these pools - which are daily gathering spots for locals to socialize - also offer 'hot pots' (which are plunge pools heated to various temperatures). If you want to meet the city's residents, pools are the places to do it.No trip to Iceland would be complete without getting out into the countryside to take in some of the country's natural wonders. Iceland Holidays (www.icelandholidays.is), with a convenient downtown office and hotel pick-up and drop-off, offers a plethora of tours to fit about anyone's interests. We did the popular Golden Circle tour - which takes participants to Gullfoss Waterfall and Geysir (not surprisingly, a geyser). The company also offers excursions to The Blue Lagoon, including ones on the way to or from the airport. The Blue Lagoon is pricey, but for my money very worth it. First, it's just gorgeous. Second, who doesn't want their facebook status update to read ""soaking in the Blue Lagoon'? And finally, it's incredibly relaxing. I loved covering myself in the white silica mud provided around the pool and just soaking myself prune-y. Be aware though you should take off all of your jewelry before entering the water. And either wear a bathing cap or load your hair up with the conditioner provided before going in. Otherwise it will become rigid (no kidding) and take days to return to normal.Finally, of all of the restaurants we tried, there are 2 that I can highly recommend. The first is Seabaron. It's down by the docks where the whale watching tours depart. It's barely more than a shack and with bench tables and upturned barrels as stools. But it has the most divine Lobster Soup for which it is justifiably renowned. I'm still dreaming about it! The other place worth trying if you are up for traditional Icelandic cuisine (which can include Puffin and Whale), is Thir Frakkar (it means Three Frenchmen).Enjoy!"
50,“Reykjavik with kids!”,"It's not all about nightlife! Reykjavik with kids can be a fantastic adventure. And it can be affordable if you plan ahead. There's so much to do outdoors (hiking, swimming, whale watching/fishing, trips to see natural wonders, horseback riding) and indoors (museums, flea market, shopping) with kids. Be sure to bring lots of snacks, your cameras, extra batteries, hats, rain gear, binoculars, and a sense of adventure. Bus tours can be expensive, but kids ride free or half price, and it's so much better to leave the driving to the professionals so that everyone can enjoy the experience. Be ready to change your plans based on weather conditions. There's always something to see, from the city architecture to the amazing coastline. Also be sure to experience the local venues (thermal pools, ferries and neighborhoods) to get a feel for the Icelandic lifestyle. An amazing trip for all ages."
50,“City of Lights Rocks”,"I couldn't love this city more. From the crisp air and clean water to the cool shops and fun eateries, it was a terrific experience. While you don't have to party till all hours to enjoy your time there, it's certainly a plus if you want to. The food choices were amazing and if you like seafood, it's as fresh as it gets."
50,"“Iceland isn't the icy one, greenland is. Iceland is the greener one.”","Been to Iceland 3 times now, soon to be the fourth time. It's an amazing place. Amazing landscapes, people, food, music. The whole package.Something totally different when you are tired of the typical sunshine hols. Go and discover!"
50,“Surprizingly beautiful and down to earth (literally :))”,"I read all of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and i decided I needed to spend some time in Iceland. Icelandair was comfortable but offered no frills. If you wanted something you had to pay. The headset (yours will work too), food, and drinks (with the exception of water, some juices, coffee and tea) were chargeable, but cheap enough won't break your budget. 5 euro for warm beef sandwich.Beautiful duty free shops at the airport before you get out, you could pick some high quality Icelandic hats, gloves, clothing and more..After passing through security and passport, looked for signs for FlyBus, the bus connection between airport and Reykjavik downtown. About 32 dollars for round trip to / from hotel, to airport. They had buses waiting at the door, if it fills next one is already in line. There were no one at the ticket window, but self service kiosk, was sufficient, with the help of credit card, i had my tickets to my hotel. They take everyone into bus terminal near centrum, and distribute people into smaller shuttle buses, and take everyone into their hotels. Ride was pleasant, lasted about 50 minutes. As sun was rising it was interesting to watch the lava rock fields, and formations.Hotel (Radisson Saga) was near city centrum, at a walking distance. First impression of Reykjavik was ""serene"". People were the nicest and they had a good sense of humor. Everyone seemed English speaking, and helpful. In little conversations I had with some locals, it was easy to notice their pride. They have three primary industries. Geo Thermal heating / electricity, agriculture, and turism. Iceland is as big as Kentucky, 300,000 people.. and 420,000 sheep. :) Most of the people live in or around Reykjavik.At the hotel, they had a travel desk, help you to get tickets for Blue Lagoon, and other excursions. You can also get them online.http://www.re.is/DayTours/GeysirandGeothermal/http://www.re.is/DayTours/BlueLagoon/Visited the Blue Lagoon first.. a must for every visitor. Recommend it highly. About 45 dollars including the bus ride and entrance to the Lagoon. Beautiful scenery, warm blue water against lava rocks. Although it was a drizzling day, didnt even feel the rain while in the water. Water was not deep, one can easily walk or swim around. Felt absolutely great. Next time i will give it even longer time. They have cafe restaurants, product shop with loads of products to choose from. Try their ""intense moisturizer"", .. it makes your skin feel like velvet.I also took the Golden Circle, a whole day trip, lasted 6+ hrs. Well spent 75 dollars. First they took us to one of the power centers, where they explained all about the use of GeoThermal power, Tour also takes you to Gullfoss, and Geysir. Breathtaking view of Gullfoss, a waterfall into a canyon. Geysir is not very high but interesting to watch it to bubble up.. if you are lucky (like me) with the help of the wind, you may get drenched with warm water. Like I mentioned, it was a drizzly day, so warm water spray was totally welcomed... Luckily Geysir hotel where we stopped for lunch had hairdryer in the bathroom!.Geysir Hotel had nice layout, a small shop near by to buy some warm dry clothes, hotel offered a nice selection of buffet. I loved the bread and soup and coffee - they offered (for about 10 euros). I asked but they didnt know what the brand was..Rest of the ride was through Thingvellir National Park of mountains and lava rock fields, visited a huge lake, stopped by to see the American and Great Atlantic rift.Next time, i will stay longer, probably will rent a car and drive around. I got the impression it is totally doable by car. Yes, they do have the rush hour as well. If you are heading Iceland, don't forget to bring your camera, lots of film, comfortable shoes, and some warm clothes."
40,“very nice city”,"I recently had a very good trip to Reykjavik in Iceland, the city surprised me we made some hotelbooking through www.visitorsguide.is which also gave us a guide at the airport which was helpful through our stay. The city is quite beutiful and people were nice. The prices were lower than we thought, there are some things presented in the visitors guide book which were quite cheap like the thermal swimming pools and museums."
50,“Wish we had more time there”,"We stopped in Reykjavik for one day on a cruise. We had made prior arrangements for a private tour instead of a ship shore excursion. Contact www.icelandictaxitours.com to book. Our driver was Olafur A. Lange and he was excellent. He was right there when we got off the ship. Immediately, he handed us a picture graph of the day before's earthquakes! There had been twelve of them but just a 1 or 2 class. Talk about introductions!Then we were off in a van that provided very comfortable seating for the 4 of us. It could have held 8 people. He took us to the geothermal area known as Krysuvik where we saw the remnants of volcanic activity, bubbling pots of volcanic mud, and steam fissures coming up from the ground. We hardly passed a car going there or coming back. Then we went by a fishing pier and the neighborhood surrounding it. This gave you some idea of how people live there. Then on to the Blue Lagoon. We had plenty of time there although we did not go in. When the tour busses got there, it was packed. We went on the the ""Leif the Lucky Bridge"" which spans the tectonic plates of the earth. After the Reykjanes Lighthouse, we went to the Viking Ship Museum to see a replica of a Viking ship which was dug up in Norway in 1882 , almost completely intact. After the tour, he dropped us at a famous hot dog stand (Iceland is known for its hot dogs-who would have thunk it?), where we had a late lunch. The whole tour came to $242 US (in August 2009 rate). After lunch, we walked around the town which was holding one of the two big parades that they have every year. In all, an extremely enjoyable day and we all wished we had more time there. Oh well, it's not far from the East Coast!"
50,“Iceland trip report”,"I traveled from Boston to Iceland for four amazing days, June 8-11, 2009. I booked via Icelandair and chose to combine flight, hotel, and airport transfer. I used Reykjavik as a base and joined tours to the Golden Circle, Snaefellsnes Peninsula, South Shore, and Blue Lagoon. This trip was definitely one of the top three trips I have ever taken in my life. Iceland is definitely worth checking out, and there seems to be something for everyone – nightlife, art, shopping, nature, etc. – even if you stick close to Reykjavik I can’t wait to go back and see more of this beautiful country. Until then, here are some highlights, words of advice, and resources.--Guidebooks--For travel within the U.S. I tend to use Lonely Planet. I bought a Lonely Planet Iceland book, and it was all right, but so much was out of date due to the recent economic crisis. I searched high and low for the Insight Guide, but it is not available in the US at the moment. (I picked one up in Iceland for my next trip, though!) I found the Wallpaper Reykjavík guide to be useful. It was categorized logically and was pocket sized.--Icelandair package deal--I chose the red eye to make the most of my short time in Iceland. My arrival was at 6:30 a.m. and I got an airport transfer to my hotel in the center of Reykjavik. I noticed before I left that the transfer voucher indicated a noon pick up time. I wrote to Icelandair in advance, and they assured me it could be used anytime that day. The buses are timed to leave a certain amount of time (+/-30 minutes) after each arriving flight. I brought my confirmation printout to the information desk outside by the busway and got a ticket and a city map within a minute. The process was seamless, and the ticket clerks spoke better English at that early hour than I, a native speaker, did.The one thing I didn’t realize was that the bus from the airport arrives at the central bus station in Reykjavik and then passengers are divvied up and assigned to smaller mini-vans for specific hotel drop-offs. When we arrived at the bus terminal, I thought we all were going to have to walk to our hotels, but that was not the case.I stayed at the Hotel Frón on the main shopping street. The hotel was clean and the rooms were simple but nice. A welcome surprise was the small sitting area and basic kitchenette in my “single” room. There was plenty of information at the lobby, and if you wanted to book tours the day before, the staff was more than willing to help.Breakfast was available in the adjacent restaurant space, and there were seemingly endless supplies of juices, water, coffee, tea, bread with butter and jam, cereal, yogurt, veggies, and meat. On the last two days, there was a large tour group that took over the place, but I just brought my coffee to the lobby and watched CNN rather than wait for a seat to open up.--Itinerary and Tours--Below is the schedule I followed. I booked all three tours with Iceland Horizon, and David Wellsbury was great in offering advice and answering questions (I did have quite a few!) before and after I booked. I typically don’t join tours when I am on vacation—I prefer to be able to venture off and see things on my own. However, David offered smaller, more personalized tours than the others. He catered to people’s interests and was able to improvise based on weather conditions.. The other posts say it all, and it is true. If you want to be in a large tour group, punch a clock, and listen to a robotic description of the sights, go somewhere else. If you’d like to have a real experience and learn something along the way, go with Iceland Horizon.Day 1Golden Circle Tour with Iceland HorizonA great way to get an overview of the major sights – geysers, waterfalls, and other natural wonders. David is a fantastic guide – he knows his stuff and enjoys sharing this beautiful county with visitors. We had a nice lunch near Gullfoss. David recommended the lamb soup, and it was delicious.Day 2Snaefellsnes Tour with Go Travel IcelandThe Snaefellsnes peninsula is gorgeous. I had not planned to include this in my itinerary, but I asked David about places where I could do some landscape photography, and he suggested this tour. I am so glad he did. It was breathtaking – mountains, volcanoes, and black sand beaches. We even stopped for a drink from a stream along a short hike. Gummi, of Go Travel Iceland (a partner of Iceland Horizon,) led this tour. He was great – very knowledgeable and good natured.Day 3South Shore Tour with Iceland HorizonThe South Shore tour was fantastic. We saw more waterfalls, gorgeous stretches of coastline, a glacier, and black sand beaches. My camera did not stop on this tour. It was that breathtaking. David outdid himself again by pointing out hidden jewels, taking us to see some horses, and giving us the best possible experience.Day 4The day before leaving, I booked a Blue Lagoon departure tour via the hotel with Reykjavik Excursions. This tour is essentially shuttle service, so I wasn’t as concerned about being part of a larger tour this time as I was with the previous three tours. My flight was at 5:30 p.m., and I took the 11:00 bus to the Blue Lagoon. (Mini-van pick-up was around 10:30 at the hotel, and we left the bus station just a few minutes past 11, arriving at around 11:45.) I spent about an hour in the water – just enough according to my shriveled fingertips – and then changed and grabbed a bite at the café (which had soups, sandwiches, drinks, and the famous hot dogs) before leaving on the 2:15 bus to the airport. I have to add that when I got home, my skin felt so soft from whatever magic is in those waters, that I didn’t even want to take a shower….! Who doesn’t want to take a shower after a transatlantic flight?!--Dining--I knew nothing about Icelandic cuisine prior to my trip. I then read a little bit about the hot dogs (pylsur) and was skeptical, but curious. So, I tried one at Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur, near the tourist board. I couldn’t believe a hot dog could taste so good. Definitely try one!! Another night I went to Vegamót which was close to the hotel. Vegamót had a great vibe – funky and hip but not pretentious. The food was great. I had lobster pizza, people around me who were kind enough to chat with me had some delicious salads. It seemed to always be crowded, but after I ate there, I understood why. I had a meal at another restaurant close to the hotel, Basil & Lime, and while it was OK, I wouldn’t insist you rush there, especially if you appreciate Italian cuisine.--Miscellaneous (or possibly useless knowledge I would like to impart on others)--I spent my early mornings and late evenings walking around the city and just exploring. It’s pretty compact and definitely safe. I didn’t carry a map with me after day one, and I was traveling alone.Hallgrimskirkja – the church is open, despite the scaffolding that surrounds it. Take the elevator up to the top and take in the view of the city. The Perlan is also worth a visit, and you can get a nice view from there, too.When visiting the Blue Lagoon, bring a plastic bag for your bathing suit and towel. I didn’t think of that and tried my best to keep my still damp suit and towel away from my already strategically packed suitcase with precious souvenirs in time to catch the flight home.Following a suggestion from another member, I packed a waterproof camera specifically for the Blue Lagoon. I was really disappointed at how the shots came out – maybe the heat did something to the film, or maybe it was a shoddy developing job. I am glad I took a few pictures beforehand with my real camera, but I still think you could get some cool shots while soaking.If you book departure or arrival transportation to/from the airport with a stop at the Blue Lagoon, it is worth pointing out that Reykjavik Excursions has lockers in a separate storage shed right where the buses stop, so you don’t have to drag your suitcase into the Blue Lagoon itself. Netbus and some other carriers do not offer this service. It is definitely worth the extra few bucks!I sometimes forget that Americans are (or maybe I alone am…) a bit more modest than Europeans, and I might be lean toward the more modest even among Americans. So be prepared to bare all and see all at the Blue Lagoon. If you think you are gonna beat the system by wearing your bathing suit under your clothes, you should know in advance that there is a sign stating everyone must shower without a bathing suit or clothes before going into the Blue Lagoon. There are very few changing rooms and private shower stalls. (Good luck getting one – it is possible. I did it.)The showers do have shampoo and conditioner available, but a tiny drop comes out each time you push the pump. I would advise longer haired gals like myself to pack some conditioner to bring with them just to get in and out more quickly, especially if you are visiting the Blue Lagoon before flying home and won’t be able to detangle for a good six hours.If you are a coffee nut and cannot function without a fancy coffee, you should be advised that most café’s do not open until 10-ish. They have fantastic coffee, but their hours are not similar to your local Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.I love black licorice, and somebody recommended that I bring home some Opal and Topas (liquors supposedly along the lines of Ricard, Sambuca, etc.) Unfortunately, Opal tasted like cough medicine to me. Topas was much better, and the Gammeldags Lakrids (licorice candy) I bought at the airport were much more agreeable, and I finished the bag more quickly than I care to admit.--Links--Guidebook -- http://www.phaidon.com/travel/http://www.phaidon.com/Default.aspx/Web/wallpaper-city-guide-reykjavik-9780714847504Icelandair -- http://www.icelandair.com/Hotel Frón -- http://www.hotelfron.is/english/about/Iceland Horizon -- http://www.icelandhorizon.is/Blue Lagoon bus transportation -- http://www.re.is/DayTours/BlueLagoon/Perlan -- http://www.perlan.is/index.php/en/spallur-perlan-103Hallgrimskirkja -- http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Hallgrimskirkja-Venue-ProfileVegamót -- http://www.vegamot.is/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=87Pylsur -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A6jarins_Beztu_PylsurI'm happy to share more, just ask!"
50,“Visiting Iceland in the summer”,"Our family recently returned from a fabulous trip to Iceland. Since there are six of us we were conscious of costs. My iniitial inquiries about renting a 4WD vehicle left me speechless with quotes over $3300 (US) for a week. We ended up going with a local rental car company (Reykajavik rent a car) that provided the same type of vehicle for under $2000 (unlimited mileage). I was a little nervous at first because this car company wasn't on the Icelandic Tourism web site so I called to inquiry if they were legitimate. I was told ""they're in the phone book so it should be OK"". In fact, they were great. You have to pay in total at the time of booking but they showed up at the airport at the exact hour we had requested. The man was informative and the car was in great shape. I would highly recommend checking these folks out if you want to rent a car. We stayed at the Salvation Army Guesthouse in Reyjavik and were very happy with the accommodations. The rooms weren't large but the beds were very comfortable, everything was very clean and the location was great. I don't think you can do better for the cost. There was a kitchen for general use which was very convenient. We took an easy drive NW to hike up and see Glymur. The waterfall was beautiful but beware the cut off from the ring road isn't marked well at all. The actual trail is even less defined. It's worth the hour plus hike though!We eventually travelled over to the Skaftafell area which was the most amazing drive. The landscape changed very much over the 150 mile stretch and it's worth taking your time to stop and get out to see the various sights - waterfalls at Skogafoss, Dryholaey, black beack at Vik, etc. Housing near Skaftefell is hard to come by and we ended up staying at Vesterhus. The bedrooms sleep 6 people so if you have a large group it works out fine. Beware of touring groups though, they come in with 20+ people and tend to take over both the common area and the kitchen.From there we ventured into the interior to Landamannalaugar which I would highly recommend. The views are breathtaking. The drive itself requires a 4WD. Don't be intimidated by the fact that you have to cross through streams - it's worth it. Hiking abounds there and there are plenty of choices. Make sure you hit the hot springs before you leave.We then headed up to Fludir. We stayed just south of it, at Sydra-Langholt guesthouse which was our favorite. The location overlooks green farmlands in the valley. The accommodations range from staying in Johanne's house, a room in the guesthouse itself, or one of private cabins available. Breakfast is included in all options and it was very good. They can arrange for horse back rides for any duration you wish. They own the horses and make sure that they match you up with the appropriate horse based on abililty. All rides include a guide which was an added delight. They recommended ""Grundt"" for dinner in Fludir which was only a 5 min drive. The meal was fantastic. The owners work with the local farmers to use as much fresh produce and meat as possible. You won't be disappointed with the meal.It's an easy drive to head out from here to do Gulfoss and the Geysirs and Pingvellir National Park . All worth the drive.Iceland has been one of our favorite vacation destinations. It got the thumbs up from each of our kids (20-25 yr olds) and both my husband and I. It's not cheap but we all felt it was worth it. It's amazing to be somewhere where there's virtually dayliglht 24 hours."
40,"“Reykjavik, Iceland - Eating & Drinking”","Dinner - italian restaurant 'VOLARE', just off main shopping street, search is worth it. Authentic, high-quality cuisine but without high street prices. Beef carpaccio starter - first class, nice local lamb followed by fabulous home-made tiramisu (also treated to free portion of Chefs own sorbet - lemon and basil, worked beautifully). Original coffee and grappa. Service excellent.INDIAN MANGO restaurant, just off main shopping street. Superior indian food, excellent mango lassi and truly great mango kulfi for dessert. Tandoori chicken with yoghourt dip was spicy but very tender. Good friendly service.CAFE D'HAITI - Tryggvagotu 16, (down by fishing harbour, where whale watching trips are booked). Best morning coffee in Reykjavik - together with fresh pastries, middle-eastern sweets and belgian chocolates. Choose a sunny morning, sit outside and watch world go by.July 2009."
50,"“Reykjavik – A Birthday Celebration in a Charming, Quirky City”","It’s about 18 months since we toddled off to Reykjavik to celebrate my birthday but as we had such a good time it’s worthwhile publishing this review, even though it’s not as complete as the others (it was part of a “newsy” E-mail to a friend) and may be a tad out-of-date given the changes in the Icelandic economy since we visited.We flew out early on the morning of our departure and came back late on the afternoon of our return three days later, to make the most of the short break. We both thoroughly enjoyed it - Reykjavik itself is a really nice city - very quirky, with a mix of all different kinds of buildings (stone built art deco, like the hotel, “chalet-style” housing, corrugated construction industrial buildings all thrown together. It is split into districts where one type or other predominates, but sometimes it seems very mixed together.It's built on a hill with quite possibly the most beautiful church I've ever been in on top, the Lutheran Hallgrimskirkja. The tallest building in Iceland, the church is beautiful not because it's ornate or ostentatious but quite the opposite - it's so simple it's quite moving! What was also very definitely “moving” was the wind on the way to the church, which fair blew us up the hill.Talking of the wind, in general, we had quite good weather considering our visit was during the winter and we saw some lovely sunshine - the harbour with the snow-covered mountains rising up over the bay is very beautiful as are many parts of the city itself, particularly under some pristine snow. The wind, though, was bitter and it ranged between about -3 and +3 degrees while we were there. Not a place for those who feel the cold, unless they wrap up well!Having said the weather was quite good, it is very changeable. I have two photos taken on the same spot, on the same day within five minutes of one another and one is a complete whiteout in a blizzard while the other is bright sunshine with a clear sky and clear views. Whacky, or what?!This “spot” was the Perlan (“pearl”, http://www.perlan.is/), which sits on a hill overlooking the city and houses the geothermal hot water tanks supplying the it. There’s a domed restaurant at the top of the structure with very impressive views of the city and its surroundings, with a viewing gallery running round the outside of the top floor for those brave enough to face the winds.While there, a visit to the city hall and the city lake alongside it is worth the effort, especially in winter when the lake’s largely frozen to such a thickness that it’s possible to walk on it. We did, though the sight of another couple on the other side of the lake jumping over what we supposed was some dodgy ice they’d found made us think twice about doing the complete crossing and we contented ourselves with walking over those bits that we knew were frozen solid!The food was lovely, in spite of the dire warnings from the guide books. We deliberately went for some of the most classy places in the city to eat so it was somewhat on the pricey side but a birthday celebration we were determined to enjoy it and so really didn't care.One of the eateries, where we had perhaps the nicest meal, is called “Einar Ben” and is, apparently, frequented by diplomats and the like. In the UK, you'd expect the place to be full of people in black-tie and evening gowns but in deference to the weather it was full of folks in walking boots and hiking jackets! Very friendly place, too, and the food was exquisite.I mentioned price and it has to be said that Iceland does seem by UK standards to be eye-wateringly expensive - we visited the local “vinbuo” (off-licence) on the first afternoon and got a bottle of Icelandic vodka, two small bottles of beer and a bottle of the local firewater, “Brennivin”, which tastes much like a caraway-flavoured vodka. Total cost? £51! Ouch! Think I'd have to be tee-total to live there!That said, we knew in advance that it was likely to be pricey and I’d recommend a visit to anyone. Next time we go, and we do hope to return which is a recommendation in itself, we’d like to go during the summer months and to visit more of the island."
50,“Reykjavik and beyond”,"I went to Reykjavik for 5 days during May 2009 half term with my daughter and we throughly enjoyed it... here is my summary in 12, questions very welcome!1) Reykajavik: Small city, but nice lanes and odd shops. Did'nt experience nightlife, but I've heard great things (so must come back!)- esp during the summer! Walkable, no bus required as such. From now on, Sunlight lasts mostly 15-18hrs, longer during June-August. We stayed at the Hotel Cabin, Borgartun. As I heard standard room were small, I upgraded to deluxe and worth it. More than adequate facilities, with cont breakfast and 20 mins to centre.2) People: Friendly though perhaps reserved. I would not say rude, but a touch like British. Talk and they will open up. Well it worked for me, or maybe just lucky. There is alot of varied tourists. You only get back what you give, so no point moaning about people. Some Brits are just moaners. I love the cosmopolitian mix. Children are well catered for (there is a small zoo and ample of pools and playgrounds). The playground is actually the outdoors!3) Blue Lagoon: Very warm and picturesque and just like the photos. Spent a whole pm there and came out like a prune (a warm prune and caught the sun!). Its fed by remains from the nearby geo-thermal plant, worth the trip. Its not far from Kelfavik airport, though 40 mins from downtown.4) Swimming Pools: Mostly outdoor. It can be cold outside but the pools are warm to very warm, supposed to be good for your health and circulation! We both loved it. We went to the largest pool, Laugardalur pool. Be prepared (hardly shocking) for the very clean Iceland Swimming policy. Shoes off at door, strip and wash naked, put on costume before entering pool. Repeat again on way back in. Yeap, lots of naked bodies tots to pensioners, just get on with it, everyone else does! (apart from some moany Americans and Brits).5) Eating: Lots of seafood, tried (wolf) fish- one ugly [--]! (at Icelandic organic fish & chips resturant at harbour) and lobster. Lamb and fish are main staples. Fast food is very expensive, daughter wanted to go Pizza hut (tut tut) and it cost £30 for 2! Not sure why, though items are flown in... Eat hot dogs for snacks (pylsur). I tried Puffin at the Pearl ( revolving dome restaurant) above 6 hot water tanks. Great views of city.6) Golden Circle tour: Excellent, scenic views, geysers, national parks, viking parliament, iceland lakes, geothermal plants, US/Asian Mid-ridge tectonic plate.... won't say more, just do it!!!7) Southcoast tour and Jokulsarlon: Waterfalls (one of which you can walk behind), churches, Glacier views, National parks and the Jokulsarlon Icebergs- tasted 1000-2000 year old ice...tastes like..... Many other tours including caving and bird/whale watching (another time!).8) Weather: Bloody good this week, Sunny from Monday till Friday. Little rain and it cleared pretty quickly. It varies across the regions, but we were lucky! Its normally rainy and windy, but its still worth it.... next time I would drive instead of taking coaches (grayline)9) Money: Mostly spent on food. Its still expensive on souvenirs but other things balance out. Under 12s are free in some cases! Nothing to really buy unless you want granddad woolen goods... Its worth bringing your own wine for hotel tipple as drinks are still expensive. Though perhaps a good deterient against binge drinking.... I got almost 195K to £1, so definitely worth going sooner rather than later. If you spend 4000kr or more in one transaction, you can usually claim tax back before leaving. I decided to claim by post.10) Quality of life: Superb but at a cost? Loved the renewable energy and landscapes. People were helpful but language is difficult. Don't worry everyone under 50 (approx) speaks English. Tried some words to make sure I made the effort... Approx 320,000 speak Icelandic, and it has not changed since the Vikings derived the base language.11) Museums: The Saga museum near the Perlan, recreates key moments in Icelandic history- some models (not mademe tussards!). Another worth seeing is the National Museum of Iceland and Museum of Natural History (though this was closed when we were there).12) Driving: Many recommended driving (although petrol is quite expensive) and avoids the tourist trap of coaches.So whats left? many different trips and relaxing in the clean environment PLUS I definitely need to come back for the NORTHERN LIGHTS!"
50,“Try the public swiiming pools - cheap and relaxing”,"If you visit Reykjavik be sure to try one of the cities 6 public swimming pools.We visited Laugardalur, which was on the East side of the city, just 5 minutes walk from Hotel Cabin.There was a 50m indoor pool, 50m outdoor lap pool and a large lagoon pool with slide, although slide closed during our visit (early April).All pools geothermally heated. The bonus was the six 'hot pots' varying from 38 degrees up to 44 degrees (hot!) and a steam room.It was an absolute bargain at around 2 euros each to get in!Don't be surprised when you get to the changing rooms though because everyone is required to shower without clothing before being allowed in the pools. There are signs showing which areas of the body need to be thoroughly cleaned. There were 2 people 'supervising' the showers!"
40,“Worth a visit!”,"We visited at the beginning of April 09 and spent 3 nights in the Castle Luxury appartments. It's a small and beatiful city, and very expensive too!We booked our trips through the tourist information centre, all trips were very reliable, and we recommend that if you are visiting the Blue Lagoon, you do it in conjunction with going to the airport, as you get a hotel pickup and the fare to the airport is deducted off the trip.We tried to find a bargain place to eat, but trust me, there's no bargains in Reykjavic.. not even in the supermarket!If you are heading out on a budget, it's not the place for you."
50,“Amazing weekend”,"having just returned from Reykjavik i would recommend this goes on anyones top 10 list of must do. i booked the northern lights tour for an evening which unfortunately due to weather was cancelled but i'd recommend you defo do the golden circle tour which was fantastic geysirs, gullfoss and also the blue lagoon as this is a completely surreal and undescribable experience which you must do. i booked all my trips through Nordicvisitor .com and would recommend these to anyone, the buses turned up to collect within times given other than the northern lights where they contacted the hotel to inform cancellation, everything went so smooth for a novice independent traveller that i'm defo going to do it again. Its not as expensive as you think in iceland as they need the tourists and you can make your money stretch very easily by visiting supermarkets and the flea market on saturdays if you want lunch out. The Cabin hotel was lovely for the cheap option and would definately return, my room was standard but big enough and was very clean and comfortable. There are inside rooms with windows onto corridors which i would have upgraded from if id got one but food was plentiful at breakfast served from 6-10am, tea was also served from 5.30ish-9pm at a modest £9 ,(1400isk) for as much as you could eat drink from a salad bar. its only downside was its a good 20 minute walk into the centre of Reykjavik and they had no tourist maps in the hotel but staff were very helpful and maanged to find it without too much problem. recommend you book a transfer from the airport, i've never got through an airport so quick (less than 10 minutes from landing) and the bus was waiting outside to transfer everyone to hotels, recommend you do blue lagoon and go straight to the airport then you don't have to worry about transfers back. trips are plentiful. Icelanders were very friendly, welcoming and spoke good english. Lonely planet guide also a must for pre visit info."
50,“Literally unlike anywhere!”,"Reykjavik is an amazing city. It is something akin to a combination of American New England, Scandanavia, and Neptune. It is a walking city, so be forewarned. I've noticed a lot of reviews on this and other sites that have said their hotels were too far to walk, or this or that was too long of a walk. EVERYTHING is a walk here....it's not that it is spread out, it just meant to be seen on foot. The Icelanders walk and ride bikes most everywhere, more than they drive. This, similar to a lot of mainland European cities, is not meant for people who do not intend to get out and hit the pavement. For those willing to huff it, they will see volvanic lava beaches next to an electric blue sea where they may spot a whale (we did), they will see the snowy mountains that surround the city, and the endless multicolor buildings, narrow streets lined with moss covered gates, enormous churches, and every sort of store and restaurant you can imagine. Try Sandholt on Laugavegi, one of the best bakeries I have ever been to. Try the quiche. I hate eggs and I still loved it, so no excuses, try it. The chocolate shop almost across the street called Vinberid is amazing. They sell the chocolates of local pastry chef and the 3rd best chocolatier in the world Haflidi Ragnarsson. Buy the red heart chocolates in the temperature-controlled case. Buy 2 rows in case you don't get the chance to go back...you'll understand why when you try them. We stayed at the Hotel Cabin, a simple but very nice and very comfortable hotel. The rooms are small but the beds are insanely comfortable, and the bathrooms are spotless and well-appointed. If your going to be staying several days, get one of the Reykjavik Tourist Cards. They operate as a bus pass, get you in free to most attractions you'll want to see including the geothermal pools all around the city, and discounts at several stores and restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, definitely try the lobster soup at the sea baron, located right on the harbour. it is a very small establishment, more of a seafood counter than a restaurant, but the soup is too amazing to miss.The Blue Lagoon is another must see. While not in Reykjavik, it is still somewhere that no one should leave Iceland not having seen, because it is the only one of it's kind in the world. This is a natural geothermal spa in the middle of a lava field, next to a volcano. All you see is black rock, then right in the middle is milky blue water- the contrast is amazing. We stayed at the clinic/spa there, which has it's own private lagoon (amazing!) Iceland truly is unlike anywhere else, and with all their economic turmoil as of late, their citizens can really use our help. This is responsible tourism at it's finest.p.s. if booking the golden circle tour, use Dave at [-] he is an incredible tourguide."
50,"“Reykjavik, fantastic city”",I went to Reykjavik for a long weekend in November of 2008. What a place !As you aproach on the plane its like arriving on another planet. Make sure you get a window seat.The best way to enjoy Iceland is to get out and explore so either rent a car or go on the excursions. The Golden circle tour gets you to all the must see sights.As advised its an expensive place so expect to pay around £7 a pint of beer and food is also pricey.If you are a fan of city breaks and would like something different then i can strongly recommend ReykjavikEnjoy !
50,“Short Break In Iceland”,"We took a short break in Iceland, and loved it the people are greatAnd so very helpful.As we were only there for four days we decided to hire a guideHe was a young guy in a big four by four and he knew every thing about his country it really put us to shame, if only we knew that much about England.He took us to and explained about the Giza’s how the towns are heated by the underneath hot water systems. How the cars have to have winter and summer tires and also have chains fitted to cope with the ice and snow.Do take a trip to see the whaling boats (even if you don’t agree with it.It is a huge part of Iceland’s history) all sitting in a line ready for the next time they are aloud out to seaWe went to the glassier and saw how it moves on its way, but I think the blue pool was my favorite part of the trip we arrived in the dark not quite knowing what to expect changed into our swim wear and walked out into the cold night air to the most beautiful sight there was a blue haze of steam coming from the water and everything glowed.From what I understand the pool is made from water filtered through the rocks which picks up natural minerals said to be good for the skin.It is heated by the natural volcanic activity in Iceland, many people go for the health benefits do go if you get the chance!!On a different note it is quite expensive to eat and drink there especially alcohol ,so make sure you check the prices before ordering.What an amazing place ,I will defiantly be going back ."
50,“Steam in Iceland from Rejykjavik to Geysir”,"STEAM""STEAM, AND STEAM!We went on a very easy flight from Gatwick Airport UK after travelling there by train direct from Watford Junction (National Rail) to Gatwick Airport Station (also adjacent) then on to Reykjavik by Air Iceland By the time we had walked off the plane there were buses outside the terminal going to the centre of the town (outskirts) to terminal with connecting smaller buses to various destinations and hotels only a flat rate fare was very reasonable no need for taxis this time.By the evening we were walking from our hotel down to the harbour to see the sunset an There was an exhibition explaining the recent history of the Iceland since the First World War the steam locomotive Minor which was used in the construction of the harbour. Minor was imported in 1913 from Denmark and is a 900 mm gauge locomotive made by Jung.The hotel was very reasonable price with clean rooms of moderate size and buffet breakfasts. Buses stop outside on main routes. We booked the hotel on the internet Center Hotels Hotel Klopp. It was situated in the quaint old time town with corrugated Iron clad houses in bright colours. There were many ships in the harbour including commercial shipping and laid-up whaling boats near to the whale spotting boats which is another thing to do when in Iceland.Coach tours were fairly expensive as was food but well worth it when you cover a large area in a day taking in the famous geysers waterfalls etc. On the South shore adventure there was also the beautiful scenery about in the Pingvellir National Park including the rift where the two tectonic plates of the earth meet hence the vast amount of volcanic activity. Pick ups at your hotel door and is run by a firm called Reykjavik Excursions - book in advance though at the hotel or in the Iceland Travel Market a s they can be busy. We went off season in the beginning of September. So friendly are the people and guides speaking English is a help.Another coach trip for an all day spin round the Southern coastal part of the island near to fantastic waterfalls one which you can walk behind and later walking on a glaciated portion was an interesting experience. It finished up with a look round the Hverageroi village greenhouse town all heated by hot water from the springs.Next we visited the other museum of transport nearby in the vicinity the relatively new facility, the Scogasafn Museum at Skogafoss near the fantastic waterfalls. This museum covers a very wide range of material from stone implements ancient fishing boats but also has a most interesting transport collection. This covers the post steam era and has for example a Kemna Breslau No. 2081 roller. Being several hours away from base it is preferable, if not hiring a car to travel there but one of the Reykjavik Coach Services trips although expensive they pack in a lot of venues in a day.Keeping in town you can visit the National Museum of Iceland with a tour if desired (and useful)Also there is the Art Gallery one of several indoor locations if the weather is bad,At the beginning of September some things are starting to close up for the winter season but we had gone to see a steam roller and railway engine in a museum in ARBAEJARSAFN (Arberjarsafn Museum) Open daily June to August 1000 to 1700 this has many relocated houses in natural settings including turf ones to iron ones and brick. The grounds were closed after we had taken two buses to get there some disappointment but no, the curator came out of his house and opened up especially for us!! Within amongst several exhibits, including Aveling & Porter steam roller 7752, was another railway locomotive Pioner, the pair to the harbour side exhibit one of only two on the island. This was built in 1892 by Jung in Germany and had been imported with its sister engine Minor in 1913 from Denmark. They are 900 mm gauge with numbers 129 and 130. Our guide explained that he has steamed the Road Roller but I am not sure it has a boiler certificate though!! What service!! The bus stop is called ARBER No 24 towards Spongin. Also No 12 from Mjodd bus station Buses are easy to use with a flat fare for travel in specific time periods. Plenty of easy to follow bus maps were available as were all the brochures for trips. You can change buses also.On the way back there is a shopping centre here at Mjodd but any beer and liquor has to be purchased in a separate facility on a nearby factory estate near the Garden Centre-they don’t sell alcohol in the supermarkets!!! They discourage drinking but a Friday or Saturday night sees the young and old have a bit too much and dropping many bottles in the street which is quickly cleared up in the early morning. For some it appears a struggle it is dear though. It was banned for some time.The Whale watching Trip is another 'must' and we spotted several minkies and also dolphins. We went on an Elding company boat at 13.00 from near the harbour mouth they also run at 09.00 and tickets on sale on the adjacent road by the laid up whaling boats .a short time before sailing A small museum is housed in a boat near boarding point. Coffee tea etc is all on sale there. This is a young Republic of only 310 thousand inhabitants an very friendly.There were, as expected the steam Geysirs in Geysir and the steaming mud of Scoptos and down on the old harbour near to the whaling boats amongst repairing on the beach and the famous fresh Fish & Chip shop on the front. No Puffins Seen this time except on the menu as it is late in the year for them.If you want to see the northern parts or go for Whaling in the North of the country you really need to stay in a Hotel up there further north because it takes too long to drive up there on their roads which have a severe speed restriction on them. The volcanic scenery and waterfalls together with The Blue Lagoon a warm bathing lake on the way to or from the Airport, if you wish was brilliant!The journey home was just as relaxing buses turning up to the main international Airport just before the flights and the only problem was the flight of stairs at Gatwick Airport railway station with heavy cases. I am disabled so am pleased to have taken in all of this."
50,"“User friendly Reykjavik, Iceland”","Looking for some where different to go? Well look no further than Iceland! I recently took a group tour to Iceland and was pleasantly surprised on how beautiful and clean the country is. First of all, my flight from Boston was only 5 hours non-stop to the capital of Reykavik. The locals speak Icelandic as well as English so it was easy and comfortable to walk around the city by myself. Their currency is Krona but also easy to use because you just move the decimal over (ex: 500 Krona is $5.00 U.S.). Their meals are pricey but there's plenty of restaurants that serve yummy soup and fish dishes for under $20. The people were friendly and happy to pose while I took photos of them and of their babies sitting in their English prams. During the weekend, I stayed at a hotel downtown and the young people party in the streets from around 11:30pm to 6am so it was noisy. But other than that, my stay in the city was great and it reminded me alot of Europe with lots of quaint colorful shops and buildings. We even saw streaks of the Northern Lights one clear cold night near our hotel while the ful moon was out.Besides touring the capital, my tour also drove the south part of the island and saw rugged moutains with waterfalls, crystal blue lagoons with icebergs floating (with seals swimming around), horses and sheep grazing, glaciers, and black volcanic sandy beaches. Even the tourist must see of the Blue Lagoon was perfect.Iceland seems to be a well kept secret because I never hear of anyone that has gone but I highly recommend putting it on your list of must see countries."
50,“Great week in Iceland”,"We went in Iceland the first week of October. It was really fun and we had an exceptional experience. Great experiences with Iceland Horizon tours and Felicia's Flat accommodation made our trip fantastic.For accommodation, we stayed at Felicia's Flat, a nice apartment near Hallgrimur's Church. You can not ask for a better location and it's really affordable. There is a grocery store two-minutes walking from the apartment and after a day of tour, it was like being home. We even saw Northern lights from the kitchen window of the apartment!We did three tours : Golden Circle, South Shore and Lake Myvatn (really amazing). We booked the Golden Circle and the South Shore tours with Iceland Horizon which I strongly suggest. The buses are small and the ambiance is really friendly. The guide is very interesting and knows a lot about Iceland.I hope to return one day, in the summer this time!"
50,“Everything you need to know about Reykjavik”,"AIRPORT SHUTTLEMy husband and I travelled to Iceland for the first time this past August. For those taking the Flybus shuttle from the airport to the BSI Bus Terminal in Rekjavik, ask the driver if he stops at the Metropolitan hotel, which is in downtown Reykjavik, and get off there. Otherwise, you have to taxi or walk into the city itself (about 10 minutes).GUESTHOUSE BUTTERFLYWe researched a lot for a reasonable place to stay since Reykjavik can be quite expensive. Our first few nights was at the Butterfly which was clean and comfortable. It has a shared kitchen with breakfast basics (ie fruit, cereal, milk & full kitchen with pots, pans, dishes etc). It also has on-site laundry facilities for guests and the owner is quite accommodating. The floor we stayed on had several rooms with private toilets, but we all had to share the shower, which was the only (and very small) inconvenience. But if you coordinate things right with the other guests, you can work around it.THREE SISTERSFor a comparable price, we spent a night at the Three Sisters. The owner there, was especially accommodating since we had to transfer our luggage to his place very early morning (we went on an all-day-tour), and we returned very late to collect both our luggage and the room key. Nonetheless, he was happy to help and we were very pleased with the accommodations--a studio-style apartment with a small kitchen, bathroom with shower and toilet, bedroom and sitting area with TV. It, too, was clean and comfortable.TOURS OR DRIVINGWhile all the tours we did in Iceland were quite expensive, they were worthwhile. Otherwise, driving distances to local attractions are quite long, and depending on the weather, road conditions can be difficult - especially on gravel. Also, not all car rentals (especially Enterprise) are reliable - while we had prebooked our rental, it never arrived--even after 4 phonecalls to the dealer and several assurances that it was on its way. If you do decide to rent, get an all terrain 4x4 - much more expensive, but really the only kind of vehicle that can safely get you around.WEATHER & CLOTHINGThe weather is changeable by the hour, so our recommendation is to bring layers of clothing so you can easily cover up if it gets cold. Definitely a good idea to bring rainwear, a hat, walking shoes and sunglasses.FOODIn terms of food - it's really expensive, but you can get by on a fair budget buying groceries and making sandwiches. Water from the tap is fabulous, so you can bring your own enviro-friendly bottle and just refill as you go.PEOPLEWe'll be honest about Icelandic hospitality - aside from our guesthouse hosts, the people in Reykjavik were like the climate in winter: cold. Not everyone, but certainly the majority. My husband and I are quite well travelled, but we found most of the ""natives"" to be downright unfriendly. But if you're going to Iceland, Reykjavik really is but a centre base from which to take tours or begin the first leg of your journey. Quite honestly, the real beauty to this place is in the countryside, driving as far as time allows to appreciate the natural beauty and wonder of a place unlike any other.there you have it. safe journey!"
40,“Somewhere different for a short family break”,"It was different and we did some things we'll remember for ever.Whale watching was great, the Elding tour was great - we did see a lot of Minke whales and dolphins. Take warm clothes and a woolly hat, it gets cold. If you forget they lend you waterproofs.Icelandic pony riding at Laxnes - what a lovely family run place. They were so friendly, let us borrow bum bags to carry our cameras and matched us to suitable ponies. The scenery you ride over also spectacular.Blue Lagoon - I was amazed to meet people on holiday in our hotel that had not bothered to go - it was amazing. But if you are tempted buy the products wait until the duty free at the airport, it's just less hassle to buy it tax free than to have to claim it back. Don't just bathe in the pool, get out 40 minutes early and go for a stroll across to the lagoon clinic on the path across the lava. Make sure you know which tour bus you are looking for at what time - there were lots of confused people.We used Icelandic Exercusions - Grayline Iceland. Fairly organised, but always a good idea to check you are on the right bus as they glance at rather than read your tickets, we narrowly escaped going on golden circle tour twice.Expect it to be expensive and then still be prepared to be shocked at how much a basic meal will cost you!Walk around the ""pond"" and look at the ducks/geese.Walk up to the Hallgrimmskirkja - the streets around there we found the prettiest.Booking excursions online in advance saved us between 10 and 15%.The zoo and family park is a good half day trip for kids if the weather is nice as plenty of play areas.We did the classic golden circle - lunch stop at Gulfoss a bit too long, after all once you've looked the waterfall there's not much to do, so in retrospect the ""express"" tour would have been fine. Geysir and Pingvellir the best stops by far could have watched the geysirs for hours.We had 3 full days in Reykjavik anf a half day - just long enough.Use the flybus from the airport - very easy."
50,“Great trip”,"Spend three nights and 4 days in Reykjavik. Stayed at Bjork Hotel and it was fine. Cheaper to book through Hotels.com than its own site. Flew from London. Air fare was cheaper by over $100 by using Iceland Air's European site rather than its US site for the same flight.We ate at the Hornid which is pizza,etc and the costs for two was $52. We are at a Chinese restaurant called Asia and had their 6 course set menu which was $60 for two. Food was very good and would eat there again. Last night we ate at Tivoli and dinner for 2 was $82 and the meal was outstanding. We saw a Spanish restaurant and the menu ranged from $13 to $20 per meal. Check menu usually outside restaurant since costs vary greatly for same quality restaurant.Buy food in Reykjavik for trips to Geyser, Gulfoss and the Blue Lagoon. Food costs there were ridiculous. A small bowl of soup was $15. We passed. We had meal bars with us and noticed that lots of travelers had fruit and sandwichs with them.The Blue Lagoon is a must as is Geyser ,Gulfoss and Pingvellir park.In the city we went to Hallgrimskirkja Church which has an observation deck. Church is quite impressive. We went to the Perlan and the Saga Museum which it contains., Worthwhile. Also went to Iceland National Museum. You can read more on line but we would recomend.Driving was relatively easy but all signs are in Icelandic and I had to stop every now and again to make sure we were going correctly.Worst experience was Avis Rentals at the airport. The staff kept trying to give me the insurance I did not want. The car was supposed to come with a full tank of gas and it appeared full with the guage at the""F"" line. However when I filled it up I noticed that the gauge moved to the right of the line so I was short 4 to 6 liters and at $10 a gallon its a couple of dollars. The final charge was higher than my Reservation which I was told was because of the exchange rate. However I had confirmed my reservation in London and was told that my cost had gone down since the dollar had improved. A few hours later I was charges a non competitive exchange rate. The whole deal probably cost me $30+ but if you do this to 10 renters a day, 365 days a year its a nice profit ceter. I would NOT rent from Avis in Reykjavik."
50,“The Northernmost City In The World”,"Reykjavik, the northernmost city in the world.Climate:-People might think Iceland is a very cold country because of its name ""ICE"". Despite of it’s the most northern part of Atlantic, Reykjavik's climate is not as cold as expected, its average temperature in winter is even higher than New York’s in winter.Attraction:-Hallgrimskirkja - the landmark church, the tallest building in Reykjavik;From my experience, outdoor activities are the most attractive part, so-called attraction point; such as, Icelandic Horse Riding, Whale Watching,...Excursion will be one of the greatest experience we will ever have,The Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss Falls, Geysir, Thingvellir National Park, Jokursarlon...We will expect a high expenditure in Iceland, no matter the food, accommodation,...If you are a budget traveler, i will advise you to book the hostel first before your trip. The walk-in price is much more expensive than reserving through the internet. Btw, you can buy the food from the supermarket. The restaurant close much earlier than normal in some other western countries. They usually close at 6pm to 7pm.I wish you all have a nice trip to Iceland."
50,“fabulous place”,"I went to Iceland with my 2 daughters of 21 and 24 years. We stayed for 3 nights and packed everything in. We had an absolute ball.If I returned to iceland I would definitely stay at the Leifer Eiriksson Hotel as it is in the heart of the city itself where you find all the bars, shops and restaurants. The staff were very friendly and helped us to choose our trips so that all run smoothly. They even loaned us towels for the blue lagoon. Drinks were availble 24 hours a day with a (payment optional) piggy bank for hot drinks. The breakfast was a buffet of cereal, toast, ham, cheese, biscuits, eggs, salad etc. The room was quite spacious for 3 of us. We didnt stay in the main building we stayed just across the road but our room was on the corner and looked to the church one way and down the streets the other direction. The bathroom was a wet room which was quite small but perfectly adequate. The smell of sulphar took a bit of getting used to, but it does disappear when you are dry.Pony trekking - go with Lexnes Horse Farm. They collect you from the hotel and loan you all the appropriate clothing. We had a 3 hour plus trek up into the mountains - it was breath taking and was definitely the highlight of our break. The people were very friendly and even though 2 out of 3 of us couldnt ride very well we were all catered for.Blue Lagoon - what an amazing place. We went in the late afternoon (about 5pm - 8pm). It is one of those places you cannot explain to anyone you have to see it yourself. It is quite modern and organised inside. You get a wrist band for your locker, which is safe. You need to take a shower inside before heading outside to the lagoon and when the doors open and you are standing in your wet bikini with an icey wind blowing on you its a bit of a shock. The lagoon water itself is very warm, some parts are quite hot. As you swim around in there with the steam swirling round and looking up at the night sky it is a unique experience.Golden Circle - this took in all the sights the island has to offer but it is a long day but very interesting.Northern Lights - this was one of the things we had looked forward to most but ended up being the most disappointing. We did see the Northern Lights but only the white ones that resembled clouds. But we didnt realise you only get white or green lights in Iceland anyway. The fact that it was minus 10 (without the wind) may have had something to do with us not enjoying it quite so much.places to eat - cafe Solon - down the main street from the Hotel. Fabulous food and reasonably priced (for iceland).Moulon Rouge - we had breakfast in here one day savoury pancakes with salad with cream and chocolate sauce on! Different but quite nice actually. A nice pizza place in town only about £10 for a freshly made pizza - you can eat in or take away.Bars - again cafe solon, bar 5, were our 2 favourites. Quite trendy. People dancing and having a good time without being scary. Most bars have a queue but only for about 5 mins. We ended up in the night club (cant remember name now) but it is one of the few gay bars in the city. The lager was a lot cheaper than anywhere else and the atmosphere was electric. Drinks in generally were about £7 for a pint of lager. Bottle of house wine just short of £40 a bottle. The bars were warm inside but not stifling. People were dressed in winter clothes and there was always somewhere to put your coat (which you did need to wear outside).tips - i would say take a kettle and a few snacks - pot noodles, cup a soup, cereal bars and crisps. These will keep you going in your room between trips and a snack before evening meal. Also biscuits/crips handy to take on trips as the food can be expensive there and not always available. Shops dont seem to open on the weekends (apart from supermarkets) but they are very expensive anyway so maybe its a good thing. The water is safe to drink - in fact, according to the locals is the finest purest water anywhere. Iceland is also virtually crime free.airport transfer - before going to iceland I had read about the fly bus. But when we landed at midnight and it was snowing we were a bit unsure of ourselves and ended up getting a taxi which cost us about £100 to the hotel. However, the fly bus is about £8 each. The fly bus is actually a coach thats says REYKJAVIK EXCURSIONS on it and fly bus in little letters. You just get on and pay the driver. You need warm clothing. It wasnt as cold as we thought it would be during the day but the sun was shining, it was probably about minus 2 - 5 in the day, which dropped at night .You did need gloves, hat, scalf, winter coat, warms socks, etc. At night it got colder. The hotel was warm enough though. We went out Saturday night (which is what the locals do). Because the drinks are expensive people have a ""party"" at home from about 10 to 12 midnight before heading out until the early hours. We got in about 5.30am. We went in February."
20,"“Reykjavik, Iceland”","Reykjavik, Iceland is a real special place to visit. Not only for the absolutely beautiful people, but for reindeer and whale meat too.I was there in November so the sun rose at noon and set at around 2:30. However, I hear it's a party town in the summer when the sun is out for 24 hours. Three o 'clock in the morning looks as bright as 3' o'clock in the afternoon.The people are very friendly and love to have fun. Every bar and restaurant is packed all day. If you 're a smoker, you're in luck. You can basically smoke anywhere you want.The Blue Sps is one of Icelands biggest tourist attractions and isn't worth the two hour bus trip out there. It's basically a big sulphuric lake that's heated by a nearby plant. It's mud pool that costs a fortune."
50,“Things to do in (and just outside of) Reykjavik”,"Friendly, vibrant city with loads to see and do. As the centre of Reykjavik is so small, you can have fun walking round all the main sights. Hallsgrimkirkja is a good place to start and the national museum is great - a really good intro to the history and culture of Iceland.We went in early March for 5 days and found most of the trips out of Reykjavik that we wanted to do were running. Probably easy to do trips by hiring a car in summer but organised tours seem to be the best bet when the weather is tempremental. Tourist office is a good place to book stuff and compare prices.We went on a golden circle tour (Thingvellir, Gullfoss and Geysir with lots of other interesting stops) and had a fab time, not least thanks to the friendly and knowledgable tour guide (this trip was with iceland excursions). The best part was being in the city one moment and the next being knee deep in snow in the mountains!The Blue Lagoon is also really amazing, and you can get Blue Lagoon cocktails to sip whilst soaking! Another fun trip was a jeep trip onto Langjokull glacier - off roading and not seeing anything but lava and snow is pretty special. This trip was with mountain taxis."
30,“Second mortgage required”,"We have just come back from a 3 night stay in Reykjavic and to be honest were glad to be back. The prices there are two times higher than back in the UK. I knew before we went that prices were high but you can't seem to find a bar or restuarant that is cheaper than any other place to eat or drink. The beers cost £6 and a main course is £20+. They did have supermarket store called Bonus which is also very pricy compared to back home.However we are glad we went as the scenery is very nice and the coach trips are well organized. We stayed at the Plaza which was very clean, modern and in a great location. The Blue Lagoon wasthe best trip we did. If you are going to book a trip to Iceland then make sure your return flight is late afternoon / evening if possible, that way you can do the Blue Lagoon on you way back to the airport and save some money. The Fly bus to/ from Reykjavic cost's about £10 each way per person."
50,“Reykjavik for a week”,"We have just arrived back from our week away to Reyjavik. It is has been possibly one of the best experiences of my life. (Although we were lucky with the weather) the skies were clear, fresh, and the town or 'city' (as it is known, however it was so small and quant) is full of energy!We did need to wrap up though!We stayed in hotel metropolitan and although we had a few minor blips on arrival, it was perfect for what a couple,like oursleves were looking for. it was basic, (had two single beds pushed togethor) a bathroom, a fridge and safe(which we didnt have to pay for) and was cleaned and fresh towels were given everyday (the only thing we assumed that would be included, which wasnt- an iron!) The breakfast was continental, consisted of a big hot drink machine, squash, bread (with a toaster) meat, cereal and salad bits. I was really pleased we had decided to stay there, staff were friendly, helpful and always around if you needed them.I was thankful we had booked for a week, as after busy days, we often needed power naps ready to hit the night life. SOmething in which was buzzing at the end of the week,(much much quiter monday to Wednesday) it was obvious that icleanders loved a good night out and were still adjusting to alcohol in there system! We always drank before we left(there is a off license- Vimbuo, to purchase much much much cheaper drinks!) as the cost of 1 beer can be as much as £7, so u can imagine the cost of other drinks!wasnt chaep!We have decided between us the top 10 things we did over the time we were there;(remebering we are young and not particularly interested in the arts, something in which is obvious the icelandics enjoy!)1) Golden Circle tour, in a 4x4 super jeep (rather than the bus) to pay extra for a snowmobile ride- much recommended! took us on and off road, mich more personal, much more fun and although the cost was higher was literally like heaven in a day!2) Nothern lights- take a night excursion, was fab! again choose a night when the weather is clear.3) Blue Lagoon- again, book an excursion- it includes admission and pick up.- and a day that you dont intend to do to much on the night, it completely chills you out!4) National musueem of iceland- it was informative and alot easier to understandthe history of iceland.5) The perlan/ saga musueem, take a walk rather than a bus! was fun, not as impressive as we had imagined but the views were incredible as we got up there and made it worth the treck, when we decided to have a lovely meal in the cafe (rather than the very expensive restaurant)- try the salad!6) must try the famous hot dogs with everything, a cheap meal and very tasty(its near the harbour in a little red hut)7) Favourite restaurants- The saloon, cafe victor(my favoutite, try the apple and cineman pie for dessert) and cafe paris!..ohh and try there local beer- Viking!8) Take a look at the flea maket, and try the dry fish (another iclandic speciality!)9)City sights, take a stroll around the city and take in the culture and chilled out nature of the city. Including the Hallgrimskirkja(the city church) city hall and take a walk along the Laugavegur(the main shopping street)10)Laugardalur swimming pool was good, we walked about 30minutes of the east of the city to one of the many naturally heated thermal water swimming pool! again we used this to chill before heading home the following day!It was hard to limit our favourite momments down to only 10, but these things we would highly recommend and are of a must!The only diapointments we did have whilst we were there, was a meal we had in Bar Oliver- we waited ages for the food to come and it was bland and very tasteless, which we were'nt used to as the food we had whilst we had been everywhere else in iceland was fab. And the cost of the drinks, so expensive! - buy from duty free and drink before you head out for the night!Overall an absolute magical time. Would reccomend it to anyone with any interests(just remember to take your thermals) =)"
40,"“Worth the splurge, bring a jacket”","As Europe's 2nd most expensive city, you will need to plan ahead, but it's worth the splurge. Stay near the old town, where you can easily walk and see 99% of the sites. Bring a fleece jacket and a good raincoat, even in summer, as weather changes every 10 mins. We enjoyed the National Museum of Iceland, which had good historical exhibits and artifacts (we also happened in on free Wednesday). The Saga Museum in Perlan was overpriced and less interesting, but the view from Perlan is fantastic. Don't miss going to at least one public swimming pool- the best way to get to know Icelanders is sitting in a hot pot. The view from Hallgrimskirkja tower is also well worth your time. If you have kids, try to get to the Viking ship sculpture down by the harbor near the Reagan-Gorbachev house for some fun climbing. Most of all, try to see the other parts of Iceland, especially Snaefellesnes and the northern fjords- a totally different experience of this beautiful country."
40,“Love Reykjavik”,"Recently visited Reykjavik for 4 days.Didn't know what to expect as Iceland doesn't exactly get the same amount of publicity as other destinations.The only thing you hear about is how expensive everything is! The Iceland air flight from Glasgow, UK was a pleasant 2.5 hours. If you are hungry before you get on board, do get something at the airport. The airline does not serve alcohol and the small sandwich is not very filling. From the airport, there are buses that take you to the city and even drop you off at your hotel for $15. The journey takes approximately an hour. Taxis cost $100. I however met with the rest of our group in Reykjavik and drove straight to Blue Lagoon. We hired a Nissan Terrano(4x4) for 2 days at £175 per day and drove off to our first destination. Blue lagoon is a place to visit cause if you dont, you'll be ridiculed for not visiting it and judging by the number of tourists there, it is worth visiting. The first thing that strikes you as you are driving in Iceland is how barren the land looks with volcanic rocks and only moss growing on them. After rejuvenating and exfoliating ourselves in the warm to hot milky blue waters of the blue lagoon, we set off to our accomodation in Reykjavik. Before I travelled, I contacted Maria at ICELANDVISITOR (icelandvisitor) and explained to her my requirements and she found me a fantastic, modern 3 bedroom penthouse apartment in the city centre (Aðalstræti) at $80 per person per day overlooking a park, surrounded by cafe's and a well stocked supermarket. The apartment had everything you could possibly need. Towels, extra sheets, duvets, etc and everything basic we might need for a meal. The owners were so thoughtful they even had sewing kits in every room! I agree the price per person was a bit steep but for the location, convenience we thought it was a bargain. The city centre with its restaurants were just round the corner. City centre parking is free from 6:00pm till 10:00am and car parking was plenty in the city centre.2 Restaurants that I would recommend is THE CARUSO which is In the heart of the city, on the corner of Bankastræti and Þingholtsstræti. Pleasant and comfortable restaurant, specializing in Icelandic lamb and fish courses and Italian style pizza and pasta. Please please do not leave Iceland without tasting their lamb. Absolutely divine. The second restaurant which our group of 7 gave 5 stars is the SJAVARKJALLARINN in the city centre in Aðalstræti 2. This is fusion at its very best.The seafood cellar, located in the oldest cellar in reykjavík, is one of the city's newest and most exciting restaurantsand has won many awards already. There is something for everyone here.The Golden circle tour is a must on every travellers itenary either by car or bus if you are not in Iceland for too long. The Geysirs are a treat to watch. The Gulfoss waterfall is very very stunning and should not be missed.Over all, Iceland is definitely a place to visit. Yes it is expensive but also is worth it for the raw and stunning beauty"
50,“Iceland Thanksgiving - Restaurants”,"We just returned from our fourth trip to Iceland and our second Thanksgiving there. We spent the entire time (Thursday through Sunday) in Reykjavik which is our favorite city in Iceland, and as usual, thoroughly enjoyed our time. We stayed at the Hotel Reykjavik which is not as centrally located as we would like but is a very nice (not expensive) hotel. Downtown is walkable from the hotel, but since November is usually rainy or snowy, we chose cabs or the city bus as our mode of transportation.Our Thanksgiving dinner was eated at Perlan which is an elegant rotating restaurant situated atop six hot water tanks on the outskirts of Reykjavik. They put on a Thanksgiving buffet each year over the week of Thanksgiving, and it is excellent. Of course, the view during the complete two hour rotation is beautiful.Our other meals were eaten at the Cafe Opera which is our favorite restaurant in Reykjavik and The Lobsterhouse. Iceland's lobster is unlike ours here in the US and is usually served with garlic. It is excellent at both the above restaurants as are the lamb and beef. Both of these restaurants are located in downtown Reykjavik.If you have never been to Iceland, it is an experience that I highly recommend either over a holiday or during the summer. The flying time is approximately five hours from the East coast."
40,“Super Reise mit Freundin”,Sehr interessant ! wir haben uns abenteuerliche weisse die Stadt in wind und Kälte erforscht. Da haben wir entdeckt die viele cafes wo man gut essen kann. Eine tolle Zeit haben wir gehabt das wir nie vergessen werden.
40,“piccole e pittoresca”,"Piccola cittadina da visitare. Soprattutto vi consiglio i ristorantinii sul porto, davvero pittoreschi e dai sapori davveroparticolari, con i loro piatti tipici tutti da provare. Altra zona è il centro, con piccoli localini, caffetterie e ristorantini,è l'ideale per passare un pò di tempo. Sulla via laterale a quella centrale, andando in salita, vi troverete dinanzi uno spettacolo molto particolare, la chiesa hallgrimskirkja dall'architettura ultra moderna (sembra uno Space Shuttle)Durata massima per una visita 2/3 giorni maxPer dormire avete a disposizione molteplici soluzioni per ogni tasca. dalla camera in casa privata, hostelli e hotel.Per mangiare i prezzi sono medio alti, ma se per dormire scegliete l'ostello a la camera in appartamento, di solito avrete a disposizione la cucina, quindi potrete fare la spesa e cucinarvi tranquillamente."
40,“Bella cittadina!”,"Reykjavik è carina da visitare, ma non offre tantissimo, ma è una città tutta da assaporare! Ha parecchi localini dove poter assaporare le specialità Islandesi, provate le zuppe, le carni e i vari pesci.l'unica cosa sono i prezzi non proprio economici. Però potete scegliere di mangiare anche i modo più economico, andando al molo del porto oppure in giro e trovare dei piccoli chioschetti dove assaporare specialità a prezzi contenuti."
30,“Reykjavik - langweilige Kleinstadt”,"Die Mentalität ist mir zu kuehl und unnahbar sowie das Wetter, die Stadt selbst hat nur wenig zu bieten. Weder zum Einkaufen noch zum Ausgehen. Es ist nichts Besonderes zu finden, auch architektonisch nicht. Im Gegenteil es gibt sehr viele unschöne Haeuser, lieblos gebaut und wenig Atmosphäre ausstrahlend. Dies ist z. B. in Stockholm völlig anders. Dafür ist Island insgesamt zu teuer. Trotz der schoenen Natur reicht es wenn man einmal hier war. Ein zweites Mal wuede ich nicht kommen, da sowohl in Restaurants, Hotels Preis/ Leistung nicht stimmt, vor allem wenn man die Hauptstadt verlässt. Die Islaender wirken auf mich sehr mit sich selbst beschäftigt und wenig wirklich offen und freundlich. So richtig willkommen außer als Geldlieferant habe ich mich hier nicht gefuehlt. Daher 10 Tage haben ausgereicht um die Insel zu umrunden und die wesentlichsten Highlights zu sehen, machen sie sich ihr eigenes Bild"
50,“Это того стоит”,"Я поехала в этот трип с остановкой на западе и в компании 15 офигенных людей, мы останавливались в самых знаковых местах и это заняло двое суток с ночевкой. Видели и черные пляжи и гейзеры и долину ледников. Очень много водопадов и вообще приятное ощущение умиротворения от прекрасных пейзажей."
50,“обязательно надо побывать хотя бы раз”,"Такого разнообразия природы не увидишь нигде. Всё доступно, ничего нигде не огорожено. Все достопримечательности бесплатны для посещения. Чистейший воздух. Незабываемые лавовые поля, водопады, радуги, источники. Объехать вокруг исландии на машине с заездами в центр-это шикарно! Одна из самых незабываемых поездок!"
50,“Otima cidade!”,"Muito legal a cidade! As estradas são boas durante o verão, para se passear na Islândia! Aluguem um carro, para viajar!"
50,“Незабываемо”,"Хочу сказать, что Исландия - это страна ""must see"". Все красоты природы собраны в одном месте. Для меня это остров водопадов и радуг!"
50,“Это точно нужно сделать!”,"Проехать вокруг Исландии с вылазками в её центральную часть это самый оптимальный вариант, чтобы познакомиться со страной. Для вылазок в центральную часть понадобится автомобиль повышенной проходимости."
50,“Очень хорошее агентство”,"Они помогли нам организовать тур, а также объяснили все детали пребывания в Исландии. Помимо всего прочего они занимаются возвратом денег по системе tax free."
50,“Рейкьявик”,"Сумасшедшей красоты природа! Есть многое, что встречается в других местах - вулканы, водопады, гейзеры - но всё другое, как не на нашей планете. Всё - открытие! Играющие, как дети, дельфины (не прирученные, дикие), добродушные, снисходительные и совсем не опасные киты, смешные красавчики-тупики, айсберги ни одному архитектору не снилось такое, необыкновенной красоты лавовые поля! Сказочная Голубая лагуна! Исландские лошадки - сплошная нежность! Океан красоты немыслимой, суровый и строгий - не для купания, но зато бассейнов немерено в любом районе города. Устройство управления городом - уникально, всё для людей. Чистота и комфорт, доброжелательные, свободные, открытые люди. Очень вкусная и недорогая еда, свежайшая - рыба, морепродукты вылавливаются и сразу на стол! Пьяных, выпивших нет - разве что из приезжих туристов, но очень редко. Интересные, необычные музеи. И никаких точечных застроек - игрушечный, цветной, старинный город берегут. Один из лучших рыбных ресторанчиков - в деревянной избушке в центре города, построенной в незапамятные времена, всё настоящее. Новые кварталы - чистейшие, удобные, малоэтажные и тоже цветные. Подъезды в обычных жилых домах в цветах, с кружевными занавесками, в диванчиками в холлах. Страна и города - сказка! И для туристов и для жизни!"
10,“景点”,"洁净的空气,一块无污染的净土,一个可以净化心灵的地方.热情友好的冰岛人.虽没去过,但希望有一天能亲自去感受这个奇妙的国度"
50,“Lockere Atmosphäre und prima Ausgangsbasis für Ausflüge”,"Reykjavik, die Hauptstadt mit Dorfcharakter. Hier ist alles sehr übersichtlich, aber schön und gemütlich. Trotzdem gibt es hier unendlich viel zu unternehmen. VDie Stadt selber bietet schon unheimlich viel und viele der Sehenswürdigkeiten Islands sind von hier aus in Tagestouren zu entdecken."
30,“Islands Hauptstadt”,"Reykjavik muß man meines Erachtens nicht unbedingt gesehen haben, ist jedoch Eingangstor für eine Islandreise und von daher natürliches Ziel. Die Stadt wirkt aufgeräumt und sauber, die Luft ist rein, was an der geothermalen Energie liegt, mit der die Stadt versorgt wird. Ganz nett ist der Stadtsee mit Wasserfontäne oder ein Rundgang durch die Innenstadt mit ein paar historischen Gebäuden. Aus meiner Sicht ist der Hafen, mit Möglichkeiten zu Whalewatchingfahrten noch am interessantesten."
40,“Affascinante”,"Reykjavik è forse l'unica città ad avere un aspetto ""industrializzato"" dell'Islanda: oltre ad essere il punto di partenza per il famoso ""golden circle"" merita una visita approfondita. Da vedere, anche se non è nulla di eccezionale, la moderna chiesa (divenuta un pò l'icona della città). Consiglio il noleggio di un'auto (c'è un autonoleggio di una nota compagnia internazionale che offre anche un servizio navetta gratuito), non tanto per la città (dove il parcheggio è alquanto difficoltoso) quanto per il resto dell'isola."
40,“esperienza bellissima”,Io sono stato a gennaio dell'anno scorso e devo dire che è stata una bellissima vacanza.Oltre ai soliti giri in città a vedere musei è vivamente consigliato andare alla BLUE LAGOON( piscina riscaldata e spa all'aperto) e andare a vedere una città come Isafjordur o Akureyri
30,“Wetterabhängiger Genuss”,"Die Stadt hat ca. 100 Tausend Einwohner; sie ist also kleiner als man vielleicht für eine Hauptstadt erwartet hatte. So kann man aber viel zu Fuß machen, da die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten für Touristen in der Altstadt liegen. Die neuen Wohnsiedlungen in den Aussenbezirken sind nicht sehr spannend! Eine U-Bahn oder Metro gibt es nicht. Nur Taxis und Busse (in 2010 ca. 2 Euro). Durch die Wirtschaftskrise und dem Kursrutsch der lokalen Währung sind heute viele Dinge günstiger für Touristen aus dem Eurogebiet. Bei gutem Wetter kann man schön spazieren gehen. Bei schlechtem Wetter (und das gibt es dort oft!) fanden wir allerdings wenig Alternativen. Dann haben wir ein Metro-System schmerzlich vermisst.. Am besten geht man bei Regen in eins der vielen Thermalbäder."
40,“tolle stadt”,"Reykjavik ist eine tolle stadt mit vielen historischen sehenswürdigkeiten. die Hallgrímskirkja ist eine architektonisch sehr extravagantes bauwerk, auch der perlan, eine halbkugelförmiger heisswasserspeicher lohnt sich für einen kurzen besuch, ein ausflug zur blauen lagune, ein thermalschwimmbad bei reykjavik lohnt sich für einen relax tag"
40,“L'ile des grands espaces”,"Vous en avez assez des plages sous les tropiques ? Partez en Islande et posez-vous dans la capitale. De Reykjavik vous pouvez rayonner partout avec un bon 4x4. Surtout n'oubliez pas le GPS car la prononciation des noms en islandais ce n'est pas gagné pour être compris. Un voyage très court de Paris sur Islandair (ne pas prendre le comfort car il n'y a pas de différence avec l'économie), environ 3h30. Une nature sauvage et authethique, ce n'est pas pour rien que les astronautes américains sont venus s'entrainer ici. Des sources chaudes aux fumées souffrées, des cascades à moitié gelées (la plus grande d'Europe)… Un voyage réalisé à Noeël et envie folle d'y retourner pour monter à cheval et regarder les champs de fleurs !"
40,“C'ho lasciato un pezzo di cuore!”,"L'islanda e' una terra stupenda, per chi ama fare horse riding, vedere panorami mozzafiato e guidare per ore ed ore nel nulla senza nessuno per raggiungere un bellissimo paese di 100 abitanti. Davvero. Gli stabilimenti termali sono bellissimi. Consigliata la piscina di Hofn"
40,"“Rau,Interessant,nette Leute und viel mehr....”","Rau,Interessant,nette Leute und viel mehr....Eine tolle Insel die ""Rauchbucht"" so heist es übersetzt.Eine Rauhe Natur erwartet einem aber die Quellen,dieNatur zu sehen ist einfach genial.Der Flughafen Keflavik ist für das Sprungbrett zum betanken und zum Zwischenstop auf dem Weg nach Kanada sehr toll und bekannt."
40,“Kleine Hauptstadt im Hohen Norden”,"Die Hauptstadt Islands ist klein und übersichtlich. Für die Highlights der Stadt ist ein Tag ausreichend. Allerdings kann man von Reykjavik aus viele Ausflüge in das ganze Land buchen. Und dort gibt es die wahren Sehenswürdigkeiten Islands zu finden.Das Preisniveau ist hoch, wie überall in Island.Beeindruckend in Reykjavik sind die Hallgrímskirkja mit ihrer Fassade aus stilisierten Basaltsäulen und der Perlan-Komplex, der eigentlich ein riesiger Heißwassertank ist, aber auch einen wunderschönen Ausblick über die Stadt bietet. Außerdem ist im obersten Stock ein Restaurant untergebracht.Reykjavik ist ideal als Ausgangspunkt für Ausflüge oder als Zwischenstation bei einer Island-Rundreise. Eine eigene Städtereise, nur nach Reykjavik, ohne Umgebung, würde ich nicht machen"
50,“Kleine Metropole”,"Im Winter Lichtermeer, lebhafte Innenstadt und bei etwas Glück auch Nordlichter. Blick auf das Meer und die Berge direkt von der Stadt aus. Kaffeehäuser am Tag und Pubs und Clubs in der Nacht sorgen für den Kontakt mit Isländern. Im Sommer tobt wegen der Helligkeit auch Nachts noch in Reykjavik das helle Leben, insbesondere natürlich am Wochenende. Ausflüge nach Videy, zur Blauen Lagune, zum Gullfoss und natürlich zum Geysir sind ein muß. Sehr gute Restaurants und Designer, die es nur auf Island gibt."
50,“一度は、行ってみる価値あり！”,ロンドンから格安航空で、冬の一週間の旅。レンタカーを借りて、レイキャビク周辺を観光しました。小さな町ですが、見どころ満載。溶岩群の中を走り回った爽快感は、一生忘れることが出来ません。ブルーラグーンが一番のお勧め！　毎晩挑戦したのですが、オーロラを最後まで見ることができなかったのが、心残りでした。
50,“Interessante lebendige Stadt”,"Mein Aufenthalt in Island hatte auch einen längeren Stop in Reykjavik. Und ich muss sagen, dass die Stadt sehr schöln ist; vor allem wenn man Zeit hat sie zu erkunden. Die Architektur und die ""Reiseführer""-Highlights sind es alle wert betrachtet zu werden.Als Übernachtungsalternative bietet sich für Outdoorfans der Campingplatz an; von dort ist man nach 30 Min zu Fuß in der Innenstadt. Und die Urlaubskasse kann im recht teuren Island geschont werden..."
50,“Absolut eine Reise wert”,"Reykjavik und Island insgesmt sind absolut eine Reise wert. In den kurzen Sommermonaten wird es auch in der Nacht kaum dunken, man hat also viel Zeit zum Sightseeing. Vom Flughafen kommt man einfach mit dem Flughafenbus (ca. 45 Min.) in die Stadt. Bei den Hotels sollte man unbedingt über die üblichen Preisvergleichsportale vergleichen, denn die Preisunterschiede sind enorm. Das Preisniveau in Island ist sehr hoch, die Qualität aber auch entsprechend gut. Für eine Inseltour empfehle ich einen Mietwagen. Damit ist man unabhängiger von geführten Touren und Flexibler. Die Strassen sind gut ausgebaut. Must see: Die Gullfoss Wasserfälle (ein atemberaubendes Naturschauspiel)."
50,“inolvidable”,"Sencillamente un pais y una ciudad de ensueño:Dejo algún dato de interés:Islandia (en islandés, Ísland), isla que constituye una república, situada justo por debajo del círculo polar ártico, al norte del océano Atlántico, a unos 300 km al sureste de Groenlandia, 800 km al noroeste de Escocia y a unos 1.000 km al oeste de Noruega. Con una superficie de 103.000 km2, presenta unas dimensiones máximas de 305 km de norte a sur, y de 485 km de este a oeste. La capital es Reykjavík.ClimaIslandia presenta un clima oceánico frío, más suave de lo que cabría esperar teniendo en cuenta su ubicación en latitudes altas, próxima al circulo polar ártico, y la altitud de su territorio. La influencia oceánica, en especial de la corriente noratlántica (prolongación de la corriente del Golfo), modera las condiciones climáticas en todas las partes de la isla. La temperatura media anual en Reykjavík es de -5 ºC, con una oscilación entre los 0,6 ºC en enero y los 11,1 ºC en julio. En las regiones costeras del noroeste, norte y este, sometidas a los efectos de las corrientes y a la deriva de los bloques de hielo (icebergs), las temperaturas son, por lo general, más bajas. Los fuertes vientos son frecuentes, especialmente durante el invierno y pueden darse también densas nieblas. La precipitación anual varía entre unos 1.270 y 2.000 mm en la costa sur, mientras que en la costa norte es sólo de unos 510 mm. Las laderas sur de algunas de las montañas del interior pueden registrar hasta 4.570 mm de precipitación al año.Divisiones administrativas y principales ciudadesIslandia se divide en ocho regiones, cada una con su propio centro administrativo, la capital y más de 20 ciudades independientes, que son capaces de nivelar los impuestos de la renta y de los negocios. Reykjavík, la capital, tiene una población (1993) de 101.850 habitantes; es el puerto principal y un núcleo comercial, industrial, cultural y educativo. Otras ciudades, con población importante (1992), son Akureyri (14.665 habitantes), un centro pesquero e industrial en la costa norte y el área urbana más grande fuera del suroeste; Kópavogur (16.832 habitantes), Hafnarfjördur (16.107 habitantes) y Keflavík (7.508 habitantes), todas ellas en la costa suroeste cerca de Reykjavík; Vestmannaeyjar (4.870 habitantes), en la diminuta isla de Heimaey a la altura de la costa meridional, y Selfoss (3.977 habitantes), en las tierras bajas del sur, es el principal centro para la región agrícola y la comunidad más grande del interior en Islandia.Transporte y comunicacionesIslandia tiene unos 12.503 km de carreteras, principalmente localizadas en áreas costeras. Sólo 2.682 km están pavimentados, entre los que se encuentran la mayor parte de la Hringvegur (carretera de circunvalación) que forma un círculo alrededor de la isla de 1.440 km. En 1992 estaban registrados 136.148 vehículos de motor, de los que 121.305 eran automóviles. La isla no tiene ferrocarriles ni ríos navegables. El país tiene varios puertos entre los que destacan Akranes, Keflavík, Reykjavík y Siglufjördur. La compañía Icelandair proporciona el servicio aéreo interior e internacional."
50,“quirliges treiben in überschaubarer größe”,"die stadt liegt in einem etwas hügeligen gebiet, was ihr einen besonderen charme verleiht. erhöht steht die berühmte futuristisch kühl anmutende kirche von der über viele beschauliche gassen, in denen gemütliche kleine restaurants mit hell beleuchteten fenstern und (samstags) vollen tischen auffallen. man hat den eindruck, dass in Reykjavik hauptsächliche junge menschen leben. neben den vielen souvenirshops sind vor allem jene shops häufig, die winterliche ausrüstung (daunenjacken, hauben, handschuhe, stiefel,...) in edlem design und sehr funktional nebenbei, anbieten. etwas außerhalb des zentrums befindet sich ein weiterer aussichtspunkt, auf dem eine riesige kugel platz für ein restaurant und ein museum bietet. auf dessen terasse kann man in klaren nächten die sterne beobachten. das polarlicht ist in der stadt wohl nur sehr selten zu sehen."
40,“nördlichste Hauptstadt der Welt”,Reykjavik wird oftmals als DIE Partystadt des Nordens bezeichnet. Dem kann ich so überhaupt nicht zustimmen. Die Stadt ist zwar sehr schön und es gibt viele Orte zu besichtigen. Das Nachtleben unterscheidet sich aber auch nicht von dem einer deutschen Kleinstadt. Das Angebot an Bars und Diskotheken hält sich ebenfalls in Grenzen. Einzig und allein die gewaltige Anzahl betrunkener Jugendlicher am Wochenende würde es bei uns so nicht geben.
40,“klein aber fein”,War letzte Woche dort. Ist für mich wohl ein bisschen zu klein als eine politische Hauptstadt. Aber die kleine Shops offerieren sehr schöne Designer Sache und die TI war sehr informationsreich. Habe verschiedene Restaurants probiert. Sie haben alle gut geschmeckt und die KellnerInnen waren alle sehr gastfreundlich. Englisch wird fast von allen gesprochen.
30,“Die Insel selbst ist schöner als die Hauptstadt”,Reykjavik ist nicht sonderlich beeindruckend. Es empfiehlt sich mehr die Naturlandschaften der Insel zu erkunden. Ein Tag in Reykjavik ist ausreichend. Von hier aus ist es möglich mit dem Bus zur „Blauen Lagune“ zu gelangen. Das Schlammbad ist ein Besuch wert und sehr erholsam. Vielleicht am Ende einer Reise vor Abflug sich noch mal entspannen. Der Flughafen ist nicht sehr weit entfernt.
50,"“Nördlichste Hauptstadt, tolles Nachleben & gute Restaurants”","Reykjavik biete als nördlichste Hauptstadt eine exzellente Atmosphäre mit tollen Nachtleben, einem reichen kulturellem Angebot und dazu Restaurants auf Weltklasse. Ein Besuch lohnt sich hier immer und insbesondere der August mit den vielfältigen Festivals ist sehr zu empfehlen! Hotels gibt es reichlich aber häufig ist eins der privaten Gästehäuser die günstigere Wahl!"
50,“水素レンタカー”,レイキャビクでは、ハーツレンタカーで水素レンタカーが借りられます。ただし、給水素スタンドは一箇所のみなので、当では禁物。あまり利用する人が居ない成果、給水素スタンドは鍵が閉められ、電話して係員が来るまで相当時間待たされた。
50,“Island - eine traumhafte Insel”,"Reykjavik ist eine aufregende Stadt - und absolut eine Reise wert. Die Stadt liegt ca. 45 Minuten vom Flughafen Keflavik entfernt und die günstigste Verbindung ist der Bus. Es sei denn man möchte die Insel erkunden und hat bereits einen Mietwagen am Flughafen gebucht. Auf der Insel übernachtet man am günstigsten in Jugendherbergen, die sich entlang der Ringstraße befinden. Die beste Reisezeit ist Juni bis September. Die besten Ausflüge von Reykjavik sind die ""golden Tour"", die man als Tagesausflug von Reykjavik unternehmen kann (Wasserfall, Geysir und Pingvellir). Als mindestens 2tägiger Ausflug ist eine Fahrt zum Jökullsalon zu empfehlen - ein Gletschersee, der ca. 450 km von Reykjavik entfernt liegt. Auf der Strecke dorthin liegen zahlreiche Wasserfälle und schöne Strände."
50,“Hauptstadt mit Charme”,Reykjavik als eine der kleinsten Hauptstädte Europas weiss durch ihre Ruhe und Übersichtlichkeit zu gefallen. Die Stadt ist weder hektisch noch überlaufen. Die Einwohnen scheinen sich sehr gut über die Stadt zu verteilen. Es gibt aussreichend Hotel . oder Guesthouses. Die Lage an der Bucht ermöglich jederzeit den Blick auf das Meer. Die richtige Innenstadt ist geprägt von kleinen Restaurants und Bars. Es gibt viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Es gibt viele grüne Lungen wo man mit den Einheinmischen relaxen kann aber auch die Möglichkeit am Wochenende in Clubs oder Bars zu gehen. Die Isländer sind eines der freundlichesten und aufgeschlossensten Völker Europas. Gäste sind immer willkommen. In nur 30 Minuten sind Sie mit dem Auto aber auch in der Wildniss spricht der typisch isländischen Landschaft mit nur noch geringer Wahrscheinlichkeit auf mehr als 10 Menschen pro Stunde zu stossen. Island insgeammt eine Reise wert.
10,“アイスランドのネット事情”,レイキャビク市内には数件のネットカフェがあるが、2007年9月段階では日本語入力はおろか表示できるところは１台もなかった。Ajax-imeも対応不可。空港にもフリーPCが1台あるが、これも不可能。
50,“かわいい街”,アイスランドの都市、レイキャヴィック。もちろん夏に行くのがベストなのですが、冬、このクリスマスシーズンもお勧め！ホテルやホステルからそう時間がかからない範囲でオーロラが観える確立が高いこの冬、そしてクリスマスの飾り付けがさりげなくされていて小さな街だけれどもとってもかわいくなります。ブティックのお店が多くあり、個性的なファッションのディスプレーも楽しめます。経済状況が心配されている国ではありますが、人々の温かさは変わりません。街は海の目の前なので海風が寒いですが、室内は温かいので寒くなったらお茶でもして暖をとるってのもいいです。あとは循環しているバスにずっと乗って街をぐるりと一周してみるのもお勧めです。街へ行ったら是非ランドマークである教会へ行ってみて下さい。
