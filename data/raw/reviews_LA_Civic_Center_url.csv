40,Bunch of bureaucrats on a rat wheel in the Civic Center,"Bunch of bureaucrats on a rat wheel. Mix in jurors walking around waiting to be dismissed from jury duty and the only building of interest is City Hall. Check to see if anything is being filmed, it is used as a stand in for locales around the world. The city is covering its upkeep by renting it out. If you do end up in the Civic Center find a way to the top of City Hall. On a clear day there is a great view. Redeeming factor is the view is free. Little Tokyo is nearby and the Disney Hall is at the top of the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
