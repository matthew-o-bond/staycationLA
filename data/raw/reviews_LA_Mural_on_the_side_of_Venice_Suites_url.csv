40,üèù,So much interesting street art in this area Venise beach. Of course you can't see it all but this one you can not miss!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyinparistimestwo
40,Fits the theme,"Sky, sand and palms. Easy way to remind you why you‚Äôre in Venice. Probably good advertising for the hotel too. Best in the afternoon when it glows in the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
40,Very nice,"A beautiful mural, one of the first mural you can look at Venice, walking along ocena front. Full of colours, it's impossible that you do not look at it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitch_sky
