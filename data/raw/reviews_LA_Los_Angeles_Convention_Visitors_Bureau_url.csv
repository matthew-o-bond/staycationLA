50,Great Location,"It was nice to have a convention that was so clean and large. The staff was super friendly and the meetings had great support for extra seating , sound etc. I liked having LA Live so close. Felt safe to walk from convention center to hotel and restaurants. Surrounding area not so safe nor would I recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ritatayenaka
50,First Stop For Great Visit,"NOTE: the office moved in summer, 2018 to the ground floor of Intercontinental Hotel building. Look for it. Staffers Mark and Brittany spent 15 minutes patiently and enthusiastically outlining activities for our day visit. They made calls on our behalf and provided maps and brochures to add value and meaning to our visits. Well worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilmingtonwillie2016

Parking is a challenge and you'd do best walking there from other downtown venues. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
