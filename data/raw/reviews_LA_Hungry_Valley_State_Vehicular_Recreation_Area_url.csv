50,Free riding!!,Spent my childhood on a graduation of motorcycles here learning to be FEARLESS!!!!!Wake up Early and be ready for Dust! Because the rattle snakes come out in mid day!!! Always wear Boots!!! Many head on Accidents here..one day helicopter took someone to ER...Hard to see someone coming head on at 75 that small especially near the campgrounds is dangerous. 1975-1980,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WellnessTraveled
50,The biggest baddest offroad park west of the Mississippi!!!!,"This place is massive! ATVs, jeeps and motocross bikes. Super dusty dirt camping style (if you want full-hookup stay at the private RV park on the other side of the highway) but crazy dirty dusty fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnLiu212
40,Nice place to ride.,"Was very clean and orderly. Groomed trails and some challenging hill climbs. Not overly big, great for a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B4776GKericm
50,Great Off Road Experience,"We have been to Hungry Valley OHV several times to go off-roading in the Jeep, ATVs and Dirt Bikes. The OHV is well maintained, the trails are well marked, maps are provided. In addition to the miles and miles of trails, they also offer campgrounds and 4x4 off road training obstacles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401allenl
50,Outdoors fun,"Free access if a California disabled vet with state pass card, otherwise pay entrance fee for day use or the camping access pass. Area map is available at entrance gate, several primitive camps (vault toilets, overhead shade, picnic table, fire pit) are located throughout the area and are handicap accessible with flat, concrete parking and short paths to toilets/acreage. Most of the vehicles are off-road or motorcycles, very hilly terrain, pavement is only the first few miles but entire park loop is accessible by regular car...high clearance, 4WD needed if you decide to start trailing deep in the woods. The State Rec Area does tie into Los Padres National Forest and some other land where we could hear hunters shooting, so keep that in mind if you travel with pets as well as the fact that wildlife is present. Pets are allowed and leashing is required; we visited in winter which is probably low-use season, didn't run into anyone until the main camp grounds (the ones with showers) so I let my animal off-leash to chase local rabbits in the hills. We camped at one of the primitive camp locations alone, nobody else came during entire week; temps do get very low at night, frosty but nothing a propane heater and blankets can't handle. Vault toilets were well-maintained, clean but not lighted so take a flashlight or lantern as this is a very nature-oriented place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145mickeyg
