40,Henry Huntington? Dancing with Kris Dodson? FREE?,"Henry E. Huntington (cut-out) was observed hanging out with a peculiar Ostrich (see photos). Delightful museum and north of La Habra Library I found a charming flight of red brick stairs leading up to the entrance.The La Habra Historical Museum is elegant and reminiscent of charming historic Museums found in Boston, MA. Kris Dodson narrated history for me. Thank you. Ask Kris---or docent on duty---about the ""strange"" mystery of the Ostrich farm----haunted!Antiques (switchboard, spinning wheel and penny farthing cycle) are on the north side. Wistfully no one hanging by the spinning wheel. Energetic and informative tour by Kris and admission is FREE! . Go, go, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/170indiac
40,It's very interesting to look back,"We love going to this museum about once every six to eight months, just to keep in touch with how very much our city is changing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grandmaboxes
50,Great place for kids and grandparents,"We were members for 15 years while our grandchildren were growing up. We all have fond memories over the bus, shopping area and dress up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153lillianm
40,A Tiny but Great Museum,"This is a small 2 1/2 room (extra film room) museum that not only tells the story of La Habra from the Indians to now, but introduces and highlights local people that have made news in various categories - film, music, science, literature, arts, etc.I've been in a lot of small museums all over the country and am impressed with the abundance and diversity of the material presented. One section is an historical mural, another is famous residents, another is history, there's even a small country store and a small movie room where local personal history interviews can be seen.At 65 years old, I enjoyed it. While I was there a lot of elementary kids came in in family units and sparkled with enjoyment at what they saw. It may not be for the world traveler or someone with limited time trying to see all of LA/Orange counties, but for a family group with time for a Saturday outing, this is well worth the visit.Pay attention, they are only open on Saturdays (I was told the curator would open it for special requests at other times).While there, visit the library. They have a great deal on used books. You can buy books for $1 per shopping bag full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenR702
