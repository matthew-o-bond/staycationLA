40,Allied Model Trains is no longer here,"This was always the best model train store in Southern California. Unfortunately, there was a fire and it must have moved. Don't bother coming here now unless you are shopping for a hot tub!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whetherperson
40,Re-openned Allied Trains Offers Great Service,"Allied Model Trains, Culver City, California. Re-opens across the street. great service. lots of model trainsSeptember 30, 2008submitted by Travelling Model RailroaderI recently was on the West side of LA and wanted to stop by Allied Model Trains. I was at first disappointed to discover that the huge train store on Sepulveda Blvd had been converted to a Camera store.My disappointment was more than made up for when I walked across the parking lot to the new Allied Model Trains. It's in a smaller building ...nowhere as fancy, but has the same great selection of vintage trains and models for hobbyists like myself.I was pleasantly surprised to see some familiar faces behind the counter. I was also pleased to receive a lot of attention from the staff, several of whom assisted me in answering questions about a complicated model train with sounds, smoke and remote control! It was lots of fun.My only negative experience was parking! The attendant at the former hobby store parking lot --now camera store-- asked me to move my car as soon as I left the camera store. The only other parking around there is on the street. I had to park about a block away on a side street and walk.My overall view of the re-openned Allied Trains is very positive. Don't let the size of the new store fool you. Any train fan will find lots of interesting and tempting models. And for kids there's a large play area with wooden trains.I look forward to my next exscuse to get over to this side of town",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrainTraveller_8
50,The best train store - your kids will love it!,"We've been going to Allied Model trains for more than 5 years - not only do they have trains for the serious collector, but they also have the biggest collection of Thomas the Train and BRIO train sets I've found, including the Thomas DVD movies and hard to find accessory pieces.They have at least 3 train tables for kids to play with or push controls at, along with trains running around the perimeter ceiling and large displays in the front and back areas with complete layouts and multiple trains.And inside is a very well stocked Dept. 56 boutique, with every available village displayed and for sale. They bring in specialty Dept 56 decor at Halloween and Christmas, but go early because they always sell out quickly!Enjoy! BTW, there is a great bakery/cafe directly across the street for a quick lunch, I don't remember the name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/techiemommie
