40,Some good Mexican on the way to the airport,"We were looking for some Mexican for lunch prior to boarding our plane to go home. Located this on line and decided to give it a try. It was very popular for a Sunday a.m. Bar area filled with locals, watching the games and enjoying each other’s company. It was a very welcoming atmosphere.Food was better than average so we were very satisfied. The chips and salsa were fresh and appeared home made. We had the posole, enchilada and a chicken tostado. So much food we could not finish.Noticed they offered a brunch menu on Saturday & Sunday which included a glass of champagne.Full bar, margaritas looked tasty but it was to early for me to give one a try, though I know it’s 5 o’clock somewhere.So, if you want some better than average Mexican food on the way to the airport which is fairly priced, give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnS122
50,Great Venue for Latin Dancing for Visitors to LA,"In May, my wife Estraletta and I celebrated our 50th Birthdays in the 50th State. May was a good time since my birthday is in February and her birthday is in August. Hawaii, a tropical paradise in the Pacific Ocean, was an incredible location to enjoy natural wonders, learning about different cultures, and relaxing in a peaceful environment.We decided to stop in Los Angeles to visit our family. One of the top things on my list is to find ballroom or Latin dance venue. Granada was highly rated and close to us. Granada was easy to locate. The club is probably one of the most interesting places I’ve been. While were there, there was Salsa downstairs (live Salsa band), top 40s music on the patio, and Bachata on another floor. We had a variety of choices. The cover was $15 per person.There was a complimentary Bachata lesson being taught. The class was large. However, the class rotated so that everyone had a chance to dance. The instructor was good. When the class was over, the atmosphere became electric. There were over 50 people on the dance floor.The DJ started playing a variety of Latin music. We found ourselves dancing with both experienced and inexperienced Bachata dancers. I was amazed at the quality and knowledge of the dancers in Hawaii. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves because folks really were passionate about Latin dancing including Merengue and Bachata. We hated to leave.If you are any kind of a dancer/admirer, I would highly recommend this venue to any dancers visiting this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrGreen2009
