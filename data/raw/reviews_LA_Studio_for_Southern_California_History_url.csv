50,A must see for LA natives and visitors alike!,"I have been visiting the Studio regularly since its opening a little over a year ago, and I'm constantly impressed by its creative approach to LA history. Every exhibit is fully multi-media, with lots of interactive elements appropriate for all ages. Also, each exhibit encourages guests to interact in some way, i.e. by adding their own entries to the timelines on the wall. Don't miss the opening and closing receptions for each exhibit! It's been a wonderful way to get to know the Studio's founder and curators in a more personal way. A must see for locals and tourists alike - and a much needed corrective to traditional interpretations of So Cal history that emphasize celebrities and Hollywood glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laura-in-LA
50,Learn LA history in Chinatown!,"My wife and I discovered this free museum that explores LA history after going to dinner in Chinatown. This place wanted my history and had this massive timeline that showed all these things that had happened in LA before BC. I liked the exhibit on sports because it didn't just talk about the Dodgers, but it did talk about Chavez Ravine. This is a very family friendly place. I'll definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alfie067
