50,Great place for a relaxing few hours,"This is a great place to take a hike to the tide pools, and to just see the beautiful ocean with Catalina Island in the distance. Between Dec. 1 and May 31 you may get to see the migration of the gray whale.

50,A Little Known Pacific Jewel,"I grew up in Rancho Palos Verdes. We moved there when I was six and I left when I went away to college. I think about the breathtaking coastline views, trails, and notable sites and I am filled with nostalgia about the days when my Dad took us hiking, tide pool exploring, and beach combing. The Palos Verdes Shoreline Park is a wild and beautiful place in the middle of one of the most beautiful communities in Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchfiretraveler

50,Excellent Hike - plan well with water & use the bathroom first,We hiked Rattlesnake Trail and it was awesome! The view is amazing! I do suggest you make sure to go to the bathroom first because there aren‚Äôt any at the ‚Äúpark‚Äù! The elevation is approx. 1250 feet so not too bad at all! We just had on regular tennis shoes and that was fine! Took us about 1 1/2 hrs down and back up! Plenty of great pics to be taken!!! It‚Äôs beautiful! Fun for a family outing and free! Don‚Äôt litter!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReVueBunny
50,"Amazing Views, Well Defined Trails!","We thoroughly enjoyed our morning spent hiking at Palos Verdes Shoreline Park. The hiking trails can be accessed from several points, but the main parking area is located near Trump's National Golf Course. From the parking area there are public bathrooms, a drinking faucet and paved trails that wind through the golf course and lead to the cliff trails.The views from the top of the cliffs were amazing on a beautiful, sunny Spring morning. The trail runs along the top of the cliffs, but is very safe when you adhere to safety warnings. There are numerous trails that then lead down to the ocean. It is perfect for persons of all ages. Our three-generation family hike included those from four years of age to mid-60's. A wonderful time was had by all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE

50,Stunning Coastal Beauty,"Beautiful views of coast with free parking for 30 minutes. The trail leading to the tide pools was so hot that my dog started to shuffle his paws and he tried to lay down. At 100 pounds we couldn't carry him to beach so we carried him off the hot sand quickly. It's a beautiful stop for pictures and there are signs about the sea life you can see in the tide pools. Lots of families were taking advantage. If you have a large dog, and the temperatures are hot, don't try to walk on the path. It's frightening to have a big dog and not be able to help them quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivingLovingItaly

50,What a gem!,"While visiting our daughter who attends college in LA, we decided to hike this park on a Saturday. 7 miles of trails that were easy to moderate. Some go along the cliffs and give you awesome views of the ocean and surrounding hillsides. Some bring you down to the tidal pools at the base of the cliffs where you can check out the ocean life. Parking cost was reasonable and the staff were nice. There is also 2 port-a-pottys along the trail which helps especially if drinking water to stay hydrated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jwkruz
50,Great view and walk,They have a great view and a nice hike. Very enjoyable and is good for a family outing. Great little stroll on a nice weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496davidr496
50,Reminds me of California's central coast views.,"The park is a nice hidden gem. Gorgeous views especially at sunset. It's close to Wayfarers chapel and Pointe Vincent lighthouse so you can walk over to them. Good place to visit to take beautiful photos, walk along the cliffs, and/or explore trails. If you're looking for few hours to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3814BZkimd

50,A small paradise of nature and quiteness after driving the busy roads and overcrowded streets in LA and its subsurbs.,"We parked outside and walked a long way along the shore with its impressive cliffs and wonderful birdlife, to an interesting visitors center. With luck and a lot of patience you may even see whales from here but I was not that patient. I made nice pictures of birds, plant, bee and ground squirrels all squirreling along as if there were no people. There were some (apart from us) but not of the disturbing amount or type..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IWNoordergraaf
50,Lovely Scenic Drive up the hill if you take: Hawthorne Blvd.,"Not only can you explore the Park, you can go to the best restaurant w/a great view at the end of Hawthorne Blvd w/an ocean view. The restaurant is called: The Admiral Risty. Also you can go to the Peninsula Center Mall half-way up the hill and you must visit the Palos Verdes Library. Up their you must try: Yummy Yogurt. Los Angeles is a busy place, but up that way it's a whole different world where you feel like a country girl again, at least I do considering I'm from Oregon. Even though that area is pricey you can get your tank filled up at the family owned Arco for about 3.00 dollars a gallon, also at the mall the TJ Max has great deals. I usually go to the Starbuck up their to people watch. You may see a celebrity....but I wouldn't tell you who!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hazel05Torrance_CA

50,Beautiful sunset and nice walk on the cliffs near torrance,I'm kind of paralysed since I came to US because I have no car yet. But I couldn't believe there is such a beautiful place near Torrance which is accessible via direct bus (route 344). Shoreline park is a beautiful place to watch amazing sunset. We reached at 5PM and started walking on the park and cliffs. It is so beautiful to look at the sea and hills around. You can see one of the best sunset of US from here. There is an island visible from here which looks nice when it is bright n sunny. Watch your steps when you are going down to the beach because it is not road but small hilly road which takes you down. Enjoy a beautiful sunset here with coffee (byo).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213rajdeepc

50,Horseback riding at Cowboy Boot Camp,"Love this place! Beautiful trails and Jim makes you feel like a real Cowgirl! We are on vacation from Kentucky and it felt like home. Not only is your time spent on the trails but if you haven't rode for awhile he teaches safety and how to treat your horse. Jim makes sure you are comfortable and the horses are well trained. We could not believe how beautiful the ride was and Jim took time to show us the quiet peacefulness and beauty of the ocean. My husband got to talking to Jim and he knew and met a lot of the Cowboys; he was impressed that Jim had rode with some of the same trails of my husband's cowboy heroes. We are planning on riding with Jim and Cowboy Boot Camp again before we have to leave CA. Honestly you can't go wrong and you will love the experience, Have Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janiej75
50,A diversion from the 405 freeway,"My wife and I are always seeking out new places to walk that combine ocean views and scenic landscaping. Yesterday, while driving to San Pedro to visit the U.S.S. Iowa we drove through Palos Verdes and discovered the Palos Verdes Shoreline Park.The park appears to be as far from the typical Los Angeles area as possible, yet is only 20 minutes off the 405 freeway. I imagine residents in the Palos Verdes area do not want the word spread that their backyard is so beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,My No 1 place to go on Saturday for Summer and run.,"THis is a great place to go and walk or run. You will have a great view while you are running and enjoying the view. Very safe place! few people there specially on Saturday noon. This is one of my FAV places for me and I like to go and take a walk with my wife randomly anytime....Also, if you want to do a little more exercise. I highly recommend to driver 7 minutes to the right and you will find Donald Trump Golf course. Just park on the visitor parking and there you are with a beautiful view to the ocean and up/down hills any type for your condition..Enjoy it..also, if you have dogs, this is a perfect place for your dogs to make friends...just go to the right once you park the car and go down the hill, you will find lots of dogs with owners playing on the beach....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mardi777

50,A hiking trail on top of a bluff overlooking the ocean,"There is a fence protecting you from the edge of the cliff, which is a steep drop-off. This is near the Point Vicente Lighthouse, There is an absolutely marvelous hiking trail, overlooking the ocean. It's an easy walk, mostly flat, with spectacular views. Further, there is a small museum called the The Point Vicente Interpretive Center. Tiny, but worthwhile. A whale skeleton, some amazing prehistoric fossils and other interesting stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea

40,Scenic Coastal Bluff Hike at Shoreline Park,"Shoreline Park is part of the Ocean Trails Ecological Preserve which starts at Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes extending down the coast for about 1 mile ending with Shoreline Park. Free parking is available at the golf course (public access parking lot), address is 1 Ocean Trails Drive, Rancho Palos Verdes. (Note this is not the same park as Abalone Cove Shoreline Park also in Rancho Palos Verdes.) Shoreline Park is more of a nature reserve than a beach, a great family friendly eco tour along the beautiful Palos Verdes Peninsula shoreline.On 1/14/2012 we walked the bluff top trail (Catalina Trail) from the golf course to Shoreline Park. This particular trail is easy and includes beautiful rocky shoreline views plus views of Catalina Island. Kelp beds are visible nearshore, we spotted dolphins and sealions near the kelp beds. On the way to Shoreline Park via Catalina Trail at least two side trails (very steep) lead down the bluffs to the tidepools.Catalina Trail ends at Shoreline Park's Gnatcatcher Trail & Sagebrush Walk Trail--we did a loop thru Shoreline Park taking Gnatcatcher Tr to Shoreline Park Trail to SageBrush Walk Trail and then walked down a shorter but steep bluff trail to the beach. We returned back to the parking lot at Trump National Golf Course via Sagebrush Walk Trail back on Catalina Trail. We had a toddler in a stroller and a 5 year old, both enjoyed the walk. The adults found the trails at Shoreline Park to be challenging and a great workout. Not too many people on the trails. This is also a dog friendly walk.I don't find much information on this park or an actual official webpage specific either to Shoreline Park or Ocean Trails Ecological Reserve. I believe the reserve is managed by Palos Verdes Land Conservancy (www.pvlc.org) however I don't see it listed on their website. See http://www.caopenspace.org/oceantr.html for detailed trail pics, links to trail maps and directions. No restroom facilities are located in the park or anywhere in the nature reserve. Public restrooms can be found at the golf resort (look for the signs).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyC1
