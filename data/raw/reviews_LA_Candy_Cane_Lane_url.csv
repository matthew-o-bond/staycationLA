40,Colourful and Impressive,We read about this place so decided to come visit (around sunset). We parked at one end and walked the road. Some displays were very impressive and the height some lights in the trees must have taken some impressive climbing or machinery to get them up there. Apparently it can get very busy if you drive it (1 hour or more to drive end to end in traffic). Great thanks to all the residents who participated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior
30,"Nostalgia, but not as good as it used to be",This places used to be filled with lights but fewer and fewer houses continue to participate and put up lights.Sad but i completely understand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelingwithsara3
40,Wonderful explosion of light and colour,This was so terrific and worth the drive out there at Christmas. We thought it was only quite small when. First getting there but soon realized there were so many streets lit up. Just lovely to look at even with our adult children we had a blast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShutTheFrontDoor
50,Do this (and skip Winter Wonders),We‚Äôre out-of-towners and our kids liked Candy Cane Lane better than the professional light show. You can feel the neighborly love when driving through the neighborhood. They go all-in pretty much all month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teammilitello
50,Amazing!,"Wow, so many beautiful decorations....including a train in their front driveway. Well, it's Ca. doesn't everyone have that in their driveway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cgrl3700
40,Worth a visit,"We swung by here on Christmas Eve 2018. There were several streets that had well lit and decorated houses. Some displays were quite impressive. Nothing spectacular and not quite as memorable as the Halloween displays on 16th St. in Santa Monica. Nevertheless, there were several houses with impressive displays that were well worth seeing. Be prepared for some heavy traffic. For much of the time it was bumper-to-bumper. Based on what I observed, taking the Tampa exit on the 101 is probably better than taking Winnetka.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
40,Family Friendly Fund,"There are several blocks where many of the houses go all out with Christmas decorations. The neighborhood looks beautiful at night. The traffic is absolutely terrible so if you are able to do so it is better to park a few blocks away and walk. However, be forewarned there are no paved sidewalks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packedandready2go
50,Winter wonderland,This cute little street is all decorated for Christmas. Looks like a Santa Claus village. It‚Äôs a very old tradition in this neighborhood . At the end of the street there is a nice Santa taking picture with kids. Very nice activity for families.every year new Christmas decoration on every single house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761tss
40,Must see. Fewer and fewer houses are being decorated.,The whole block is decorated. Each house is independent. Some have themes. Park a few blocks away and walk. No driving on the actual block. It is very safe. Police are there. Can bring kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235kingl
50,"I live here, read for fun and rules","I live here, and have been on the news in support of it.I believe this city needs holiday traditions to help up-lift us but the community here is very sensitive to lack of consideration and drunk-teenager hi-jinks which are viewed with extreme prejudice and resulted in many houses going dark. Some of them have come back, I hope more, we do have many houses helping their fine neighborhood with their holiday cheer.Okay to answer some questions:1) It goes from Hatteras / Winnetka, to Penfield, to Lubao, to Oakdale, to Jumilla. About 2 blocks in each direction. Martha has a few heavy-weights but more towards Hatteras and Oxnard. Penfield has some heavy-hitters as well and is is an up-and-comer decoration-wise.2) Don't litter, don't block driveways (seriously this one is more important thank you think), don't play loud music especially if it's not holiday music.3) We shut down around 10 weekdays, 11 weekends but are a little lenient on that closer to Christmas if people are quiet.4) This is 100% a volunteer activity, and yes is does cost a lot in power and time to set up, but many believe it's worth it to cheer our city and make the holidays amazing, our city needs the love.5) You should walk, and when you walk, clean up trash, watch for rowdy jerks and stare them down a bit, wave to the neighborhood and thank them. If you want to drive, don't honk, we hate that.6) Yes please take plenty of photos, have fun.7) Try not to go up on property, pose in front of exhibits but not on the property please, unless the owner states / posts otherwise.8) We don't like non-charity vendors as they block traffic and defeat the spirit of the event. Please do not buy items from them as we work hard to make this a community support event and they are taking advantage of that. EXCEPTION, if that vendor is donating to charity, in support of the local schools and neighborhood then this tends to be accepted (and to those that accept it I appreciate it personally).9) Wear Christmas hats / outfits. This isn't a rule, it's just fun so go for it. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793mattheww
50,Long Tradition,"I grew up in this neighborhood. We were on ""Bell Lane"". It was a wonderful tradition then, and hope it remains. The core decorations -- bell or candycane or bell-puller -- went with the house if it was sold. Growing up there, we still would drive around to other neighborhoods to see the lights. Still a favorite part of my holiday, even though I'm far from Woodland Hills now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Climber12628
40,Holiday Spirit,"We try to come to Candy Cane Lane every December, and it never fails to get us in a great Holiday spirit. Everyone in the family loves it and we always look forward to it. Bring a light Jacket and your hot cocoa as you walk down the street and look at all the pretty decorations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilia6987
30,Nice to see but car needed,"This is a real American Christmas happening. Nice to see, however it‚Äôs recommended to take the car when you plan to visit. The best time is to visit between 5:00 and 6:00pm.Some gardens were really looking impressive, while other ones were disappointing. Overall, if you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood it‚Äôs worth it to have a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rreesink
50,T‚Äôis The season to be festive üòÑ,This is an absolute treat! If you are in the South Bay Area during the month of December you should treat yourself to walking or driving through the beautiful neighborhood of Sleepy Hollow which transforms itself into the magnificent Candy Cane Lane. My Family and I walked through in the evening. I have never seen such beauty. Each homeowner takes great care and employs such creativity to decorate their home. I felt so thankful and privileged to experience such a sight. Quick tip- be courteous and respectful so that this neighborhood will continue to welcome visitors ‚ù§Ô∏è,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jbalsz
20,Disappointed,I have lived in area my entire life and would go to Candy Cane Lane every year as a child. There were a few houses that were decorated and they were awesome. It took about 10 minutes to see everything. I remember as a child all the cars driving would turn of the car driving lights and cruise the neighborhood enjoying the lights on all the houses. But this year things were so different. Not sure what happen this year. There was a hispanic lady standing on the corner selling stuff. Please bring back the old Candy Cane Lane it is truly missed by everyone that grew up here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsh91367
10,Lame #neveragain,"Sorry guys but I have to tell you this attraction is bogus. I am Mrs. Christmas (and my husband is a fan too)!! We love this season and everything that it brings. We try to do as much as we can throughout this month to see it all!! This, however , is not worth the drive nor the wait or the dodging of people crossing the street with their children. These houses are decorated pretty much the way that they would look on your own street. So grab a hot chocolate and a jacket and walk up and down your street and take a look at all the houses decorated there. I promise you it'll be way better than going to Candy Cane Lane. If you really want to go for a great sightseeing of Lights experience, go to Santa Clarita and go to Courtland way. It's called the Wakefield Winter Wonderland. It's beautiful how this community has come together to decorate their homes and there's a story as to why they are all connected with lights. Ask them about it! They love telling their story! Oh, don't forget to bring some toys, unwrapped for Toys for Tots. There's a choo choo train at the end of the cul-de-sac that will collect them!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyAmy521
50,Christmas fun,"We visited on Christmas Eve and it was busy but still not busy enough to spoil the fun.While a few people had parked and were walking around, we decided to stay in the car as there were no real sidewalks and it felt safer. Most cars drive round with their side lights so as not to dazzle peopleOver a number of blocks, a lot of the houses were very well decorated and we spent a good hour and a half slowly cruising round checking them all out. There were some excellent displays, including someone with a train in their gardenA fun and free activity that made our stay in LA fell a bit more Christmassy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FullFonz
40,To get that Christmas feeling!,"It was very busy, a lot of cars were lining up along the streets. I decided with my friend we would walk past the houses, so we could take time to make pictures and enjoy the cold air.It was fun, the houses looked great, and it was a fun hour to spend here on 1st Christmas day. Worth it, especially if you're not used to seeing this type of Christmas decorations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/192marav
40,Small but excellent!,"My wife and I went to this street of lights with a good friend. There were a lot of young families enjoying the lights but I think that this location could be enjoyed by all ages. Each house on the closed road had a unique display of lights and Christmas themed characters. A Santa Claus is available for pictures If you come at the right time.Though the length is only about 1 city block, I would say that this steeet could justify 30-45 mins walking and looking. Maybe more if someone in your group loves selfies ;)Other houses in the area have lights, some are also equal to what you will find on the official ""candy cane lane"" in this spot but not dense enough to really walk the rest of the area. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderH19
50,Always great.,"You can drive around the various blocks to see the homes that partake in the displays, or you can walk. It's great, and even if less houses are decorating lately, it seems, it's still a wonderful and festive event, which people are passionate about their displays, and we appreciate it. Thank you for putting this show up every year! The kids will love it, as the adults will, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonB853
50,Beautiful Christmas Decor,Must see in LA! The residents of this neighborghood do a amazing job getting together for a Christmas show. It's a perfect place for families to go for a walk. We even take our dog with us and he love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761tss
40,So Christmasy,"We drove down here at the end of November but it was still such a wonderful sight. Its worth parking your car and walking around the area, take your camera and tripod if you want that perfect picture. I gather in December the cars can get backed up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwells6
40,Fantastic Christmas event but not ADA compliant,"This is spectacular for a mobile Christmas event. Something for everyone young and old. But, it is not wheelchair friendly. There is no handicapped perking, the ticket counter is excessively high and the pathways are covered in rocks causing uneven paths. The sled hill, hayride, train and bounce houses are not compliant for ADA. Persons with disabilities cannot use them. As long as a person with any disability goes to this event knowing that many of the attractions are off limits, they can then decide if enjoying the lights is enough. Additionally, I waited in line to ride the Christmas train and was told I could not ride unless I was riding with a child. So you know, the train is for adults only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess5
50,Fun place to walk or drive,I've been here both walking and driving with friends. It's always thrilling to see all the decorations and creativity throughout the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs

30,Chill,"This year was our second time seeing these lights. It was less impressive then 2014. There were less lights and less decorations in general.I liked walking around better then driving through. We rated the houses and tried to decide how we would decorate our own house if/when we have one.This is a good chill activity for couples, friends, and parents with kids :)If you decide to walk around I would recommend warm cloths and a hot drink :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelsB7485HV
20,Disappointed,"Visiting Candy Cane Lane for the first time. This is the 2nd week of December, two more weeks to Christmas. So far only about less than 30 houses have decorated.None of the decorated house has ""WOW"" me. Majority of the house are just simple Christmas lighting.Will check it out again the next weekend and update my review.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Really puts you in the Holiday spirit!,"What a great way to celebrate the Holiday's than with a drive or walk in Candy Cane Lane. Come earlier in the month rather than later to avoid traffic and enter the back way. If you're driving, turn on off your lights and make sure your foot is on the brakes. If you're walking have a cup of hot chocolate, bundle up and snap a lot of photos of the beautiful decorations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
20,Nice but you can skip it,"Just a couple of houses are keeping the art at good level, the rest may have been great in the past but not right now (2014)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gus6
50,Candy Cane Lane-Sleepy Hollow,"Located off Pacific Coast Highway and Calle Mayor in Torrance California you will find one of the best all time Christmas tree light and decoration display ever seen. One word of warning, though, the closer to Christmas you get, the more crowded it becomes. Also, if you go on a weekend your crowd will be 10 x bigger than if you try during monday through thursday.I sort of feel sorry for the residents of this community but then I realize that they all decided to decorate together so they must love it, right? You can either drive through - and because it is usually crowded you will be traveling slow enough to see everything well - or you can park and walk through. Walking is especially nice when there is music accompanying the decorations, which many have. Another attraction is that many of the more enterprising neighborhood teens put up hot cocoa stands and some even sell holiday cookies or churros. This is especially appreciated on cooler nights which can dip into the 40's.I think they leave their light displays up past Christmas day till about New Year's but I'm not sure about that. If you want to make sure to see the displays, go before 12-25. You won't be sorry and will likely make it into a family tradition as we have done. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
40,Good lights,"I have visited Candy Cane Lane twice . Last year had more lights than this year in my opinion. I was somewhat disappointed this year that there was not so much Christmas lighting like I remembered from last years visit. Overall a good site to see. It's nice to walk to see all the homes. Its a plus in my book if you are not stuck in a car, in traffic, and you can take pictures near the homes. Good for little kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3864ZVlizc
50,Fun Area to See Chistmas Lights,We love to look for Christmas lights; it is one of our favorite activities to do. We are often in the Los Angeles area around the holidays and we enjoy taking the drive down Candy Cane Lane. it definitely puts us in the holiday spirit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,Just Okay,"Our family loves Christmas and we love to go look at houses that decorate in abundance (we too decorate in abundance!) Our daughter had wanted to go to Candy Cane Lane in LA for years and asked for us to take her on her birthday (we live about 2.5 hours away), so we went in Dec 2013 and were somewhat disappointed. Some of the houses were fantastic, with every inch of their property brightly lit and others were very lacking and some were just plain weird (still scratching our heads on the Quasi Moto display). If we were in the LA area around Christmastime I would drive by again but I would not make a special trip to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zekesgirl
50,Guaranteed to Give Christmas Spirit!,"Our son drove us through this attraction during our recent visit, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. There is such variety and beauty in people's lighting, and it's heartwarming to see families out and having fun together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
50,tradition,All of the neighbor pitch in and make it speacial. the traffic is terrible park on next block and walk. The driver should not look as lots of people cross the street in the dark. be very careful if driving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandlisaK
20,Not anymore...,"I remember the first time I visited Candy Cane Lane 15 years ago. 99% of the house were decorated with amazing and fancy Christmas lights. It has gone down since then. I took my family this year hoping that it would surprise me again, yet it did surprise me with great disappointment. I am no expert or anywhere near it, but I could only see a few houses where I see the old glorified passion about Christmas lights. If you don't mind driving farther, Eagle Hill Kraemer and Birch in Brea is much much better where you could find a place to park and walk around for Christmas lights that are like Candy Cane Lane 15 years ago or even better because I was there last year. This place has gone down a lot and it barely hanging there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKC206
40,Best Christmas Eve in a looooong time,"I went Christmas Eve 2012.. it was great! A house even had Santa nd his elves to pictures with. Traffic was crazy! Me and my girl parked on Oxnard and winnetka nd just walked the neighborhood. It was cold, but I recommend walking because u can see more things. Not all the houses were decorated I'd say 60-70% were. I felt like a kid again looking at all the lights. Great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l56carter
10,"Worth it? Based on 2011 Dec 23 visit, that is a Big N-O!!!","Went last year 2011. Biggest disappointment. Don't understand the other reviews. Maybe it was the time I went. Couple days before Christmas. Perhaps the homeowners were protesting or something. There was traffic down the street, but no lights to mention. Seen much better places. Dont understand how they got the landmark sign. Perhaps living on past glories? I wasn't the only car making the cruising up and down the street. It was a bust. Might give it another chance this year. I did not take pictures it was such a let down. I often take lots of pictures. 2012, one more chance. Maybe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galahad17
40,Kids love the lights!,"Worth the visit! I've been taking my kids here year after year for about ten years now. Although not as many houses are participating, it's still fun for the kids to see the lighted houses and extravagant Christmas decorations. My tips are to go during the weeknights and avoid weekends. Go about two weeks before Christmas to see most houses lit. Drive with your low beams on once you enter Candy Cane Lane....and finally, put some Christmas music on to get into the spirit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,Nice but very crowded,"We always go there when we are there at Christmas, lots of beautiful displays and nice homes to see, but the traffic is not worth the time sometimes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popcrnluvr
50,"Legendary, Christmas lights.","I have been going to this Christmas light display as long as I can remember. It was a can't wait for Christmas, Just to get into the van and wanting to see Santa at the corner giving out Candy canes to every car went by. I live in Vegas, NV. Now and take the 5 hour ride to Woodland Hills just for the light display. Their is light display here in Vegas, but when you grow up near Woodland Hills, and you now have kids, you would show what decorating means for Christmas block after block after block. . and the funnel cake truck is the best. . So what we do is right to the funnel cake truck first fill up every one with hot chocolate and funnel cakes and then start from the end to the beginning it just makes it easier with traffic. It does get pack fast. The most I love about this is that you can roll down your windows let the kids be kids, Lots of people and young children yelling out Merry Christmas to cars and some passing out candy canes. . it's a few hours of what kindness that's hard to find now a days. I say it's so much fun to get out of the house or town and get the kids together for family time again. The only thing is that their is no restrooms, or I have not seen any yet. But just around the corner are places that you can. CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR!!!! EVERY YEAR THEIR ARE SO MANY NEW THINGS AND THEMES AND YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR OLD THAT BRING BACK THE FAMILY MEMORIES. . . THEIR IS THIS ONE HOUSE THAT HAS BEEN DOING THE SAME THING FOR YEARS AND I LOVE IT. . IT BRINGS BACK MY FATHER IN MY MEMORIES.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JcyJ
50,Christmas Lights,"I went to See the Lights in WoodLand Hills, California Neighborhood. I never expected to see such Beautiful Christmas Displays. There was every scene possible from the traditional Nativity scene to Marvel Comics, Toy Story, Lots of Reindeer, Elmo, even a display of the movie ""Up"" ! It was an awesome experience! We even saw Santa on a motorcycle driving around the neighborhood. All the houses were fully decorated with so many lights and Awesome Large seasonal Props. There was a variety of neon glow sticks and raindeer ears for sale by some very Friendly Folk!The Funnel Cake truck was there, cost of each funnel cake was $6.00, a little high, but it was Large enough to feed 3 persons. I definetly recommend driving to WoodLand Hills to see the light display. Its better to park your car & walk to avoid the backed up traffic. That way you can fully enjoy & appreciate the Many Light displays. Its about a mile and a half of fully decorated houses back to back! Merry Christmas 2009.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Febeautiful

50,So much fun,I've been going to Candy Cane Lane ever since I can remember. We used to get hot chocolate and ride in the back of the pick-up truck around the neighborhood.

It is a must at Christmas time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sk8nmeg
50,Rare Non-commercial Beautiful Christmas Tradition,"It was quite hard to find in an otherwise unattractive residencial area. Once we found it, we were full of ""oohs and aaahs.
