50,A Great United Club in LAX T-7,"A Great United Club in LAX T-7We fly United Airlines very, very much, and have had our United Club Membership, for over a decade, plus used many of those clubs, going back to when they were called “Red Carpet Clubs,” over 20 years ago.In August, we visited the United Club at LAX, in Terminal 7. This particular club had fairly recently opened - well sort of. Going back a bit, there were two UA Clubs in T-7: the “regular” UA Club, and then the United First Class Lounge. They were close to each other, but were very different. United converted the old First Class Lounge, into a regular United Club on a temporary basis, while they completely redid the United Club - this one. Then, the temporary Club was closed, to be completely reworked, to become the Polaris Lounge.The United Club at T-7 is entered from the main concourse level, right at the point, that Terminal 7 branches off from the main walkway between T-7 and T-8. The old club was near the “hub” in T-7, by Gates 75 & 76 - where the new Polaris Lounge is located, upstairs now.The entry to the United Club is smallish, and just a counter (3 agents on this visit), a little roped queue (empty on this visit), and then escalators upstairs to a very expansive Club - larger than most we have encountered and that includes both Clubs at DEN, EWR and all Clubs at SFO, IAH and IAD. This is just a lovely, and spacious United Club, and maybe even larger, than the flagship UA Club, at LHR - the one, around which all United Clubs have been fashioned, for several years.We rode up those escalators (two elevators also serve the Club), and found a very large, and brightly lit seating area, with various chairs, desks and tables, in useful configurations.Beyond that massive area, one had the bar area, which is almost as large, with varied seating, and even more windows - including an outdoor balcony, also with seating.We found a table, near the bar, and one with a pop-up AC/USB outlet, right in the middle. These are so very useful.I ordered two glasses of the Rombauer Chardonnay, from the “Premium Wine List.” Those selections are about $15/glass (varies by wine), but could have ordered free wine, from the regular list. However, I feel compelled to go with the Premium, and for two reasons: better wines, IMHO, and then I spent 10 years writing letters to United, requesting better wines, even at a premium price. Finally, that happened, but it was shortly before the United - Continental merger. Continental had offered free wines, beers and spirits in their clubs, where United sold them. Suddenly, the United Clubs had free booze too, so I thought that it would be the end of a short run for the Premium Wines. However, that proved wrong, and several UA Club bartenders tell me that they actually pour more from the Premium list (for a fee), than from the free list.Now, the bar is open on all sides, and adorned by the beautiful Moooi Raimond Illuminated Spheres. One side looks out toward the old Theme Building - that iconic space-age structure, still associated with Los Angeles Airport, and another looks out to the outdoor balcony, overlooking T-8.We did not really indulge in the rather large buffet, on the other side of the bar, or the showers, just down the hall. The buffet looked impressive, and was rather busy - and all we sampled were some cheese and crackers, with our Chardonnay.Though the crowd was a bit thick, with the size of this Club, they were off in little corners, or so it seemed - lots of vacant seating, almost everywhere.All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating, and we are starting to recognize the bartenders here, but have been connecting at LAX far more, than in the past. A lovely Club, with great amenities to get a bit of work done, while sipping wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Loup_Garou
40,Comfortable but disappointed,"The club is spacious and comfortable. A respite from the general public in the terminal. The food is good. My only complaint isn’t that the bar has eight beers on tap and only BUDWEISER is complimentary. $5 surcharge for other beers, including other mass produced options like Blue Moon or Sierra. I suppose they are still cheaper than in the terminal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
50,How good can it get?,We have been members for many many years and continue to be impressed with all of the recent improvements. We now live in San Diego so fly thru LAX often in our travels. Last week we were returning from a ski trip and had a 2+ layover prior to our San Diego flight. The plus was that it was close to dinner time so we were able relax and dine comfortably. The food selection has improved dramatically offering various ethnic dishes which is a real plus. It made traveling a little more bearable.Thanks for all the work on the club!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLG1111
50,This is the best lounge in United’s domestic network.,This is the best lounge in United’s domestic network. Ive been going here for years. The staff are really nice and very competent. The food selections are broader and better than others and internet access is very good. Frankly if you have one time passes this is the place to use them. If you are a member it’s worth the stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leehM1356PT
