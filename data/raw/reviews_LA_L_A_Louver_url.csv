50,Like visiting an art museum minus the crowds,"This intimate art gallery is tucked away just a half block from the ocean. From now until March 23, they have a terrific David Hockney exhibit of paintings, portraits and also his new perspectives 3D photo illustrations. Be sure not to miss Alison Saar's fabulous bronze ""Grow'd"" on the upstairs terrace. Though the art is all for sale, no sales pitches here or guards warning you not to get too close. No entry fee either and free half hour parking across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mah_Murrini
