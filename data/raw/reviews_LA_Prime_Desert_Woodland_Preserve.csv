50,A great booby prize,"Went to visit the Elyze Clifford interpretive center but found it closed with very limited visiting hours. However, the nature preserve which surrounds this building was open and inviting. We strolled quietly through the park and found ravens, hummingbirds, jackrabbits (long-eared hares actually) and cotton-tailed rabbits as well as an assortment of informative, educational signs about the trees and okants found in this unique desert woodland surrounded by urban sprawl. At sunset on a fine autumn day it was a wonderful way to end the week. And we learned when to come to the interpretive center as well.",bfindysz
40,Nice place,This is a nice place to walk and explore...lots of animals and nature to observe... enjoyable place to go for a walk,jenjetmd
30,Pretty park,Nice flat paved trails. Lots of interesting things in the visitor center that would be especially fun for younger children. The Joshua trees will bloom soon.,Naomi W
40,A quiet walk,"This is a great place to visit for both a quiet walk in nature and for a nature center for the kids. The outside walk is a nice concrete flat walk, good for wheelchairs, and has benches for resting. In the spring and summer, they have outside programs for llooking at the stars and selected desert animals. Inside the nature center, there are activities for the children that will keep them entertained for about an hour.",H8900IJdonnap
40,Winter Weather Hike,For 4-H we went hiking and took pictures of the Desert climate after a winter storm had passed. We saw jack rabbits and cotton tails and enjoyed the cool weather. There is a lot to see and it’s a peaceful atmosphere. The interactive center is also nice to visit especially for younger children. They also have a Moon light hike once a month which talks about the constellations.,Sarah H
50,Walking place,It’s a Great place to go for a walk. Nice and quite. You can go by yourself or with friends and family.,Noah_821
50,Nice place to walk around and enjoy the nature.,This is a very nice place to walk around and see all the natural preserve. It is a quite big park and very well maintained. We went in the morning around 9 and stayed for about an hour. I enjoyed it. There is also a little free museum by the entrance.,Linda W
40,A Beautiful Place to Enjoy,The Prime Desert Reserve is a beautiful place to stroll or jog enjoying the desert landscape. It's a perfect place to watch the sunset behind the Joshua Trees.,Crystal R
50,Love the night time tour with the docent!,Very interesting discussion about the solar system. Nice displays of local fauna and flora. Great to take kids who would be interested.,Diane M
50,Peaceful sanctuary,"This is one of our favorite places to visit. Multiple peaceful trails, bridges, educational information to read, and wildlife and nature to observe (both in the day and at night). The moon walks are excellent, as well as the astronomy club's telescopes.Morning strolls with children, family, and friends are so nice. You wouldn't know you are right in the middle of central Lancaster. And how great that the preserve's expansion project will protect more Joshua trees and wildlife. We love seeing the birds, rabbits, and vegetation.There is also a great picnic area and educational center. Such a great place!",DestinationLancaster
40,Very pleasant but not much shade if it is hot,"This is a pleasant place to spend an hour or two if you are in the area. You will see plenty of rabbits and squirrels. Young kids will find it very enjoyable. One caveat is that all the various paths are out In the open and the shade is minimal. Therefore, be sure to wear plenty of sunblock if you are out and about on a very hot and sunny day. The visitor center is very pleasant with good toilet facilities. Probably best to visit here during the winter when it is cooler.",vincemc
50,Christmas time at the Woodland Preserve,Our family loves visiting the Prime Desert Woodland Preserve during the Christmas holiday time. They decorate the patio area with beautiful lights. It's a great place to visit. We have also been there on several field trip outings throughout the year and have had fun on the hikes and listening to the guest speakers. It's a nice place to visit for a family outing.,202shelleyr
50,Christmas lights,"What a great idea! It is a small area that is decorated, but it is very well done. Lights in song with the music. An open area to dance on a patio if you so choose.",Denice S
50,Beautiful.,"The Prime Desert Preserve is just beautiful. It is in the high desert of Mojave, in the City of Lancaster.During the Spring the area is filled with color (for a desert). The trees and cactus are blooming and the brush is green mixed with desert plants and rocks. The area is filled with jackrabbits and a few snakes. You will not likely encounter any snakes as they prefer the night, out of the sun.It does get hot, so if you are going to take a walk or hike always take water with you.The ground squirrels are adorable and for a City living person, we always love any kind of critter. There are plenty of birds to see and if you are lucky you might come across a turkey vulture, but that is not a common occurrence.This area used to sit alone among the desert off the 14 Highway, but the area around it is built up now with homes and stores, It is wonderful anyway. This area is one of the first where you will see the start of the beautiful Joshua trees.There are walking paths and none of it is a hard walk.Enjoy.",elizabethlascheid
50,"Jackrabbits. Cottontails, Ravens, Quail, Cactus Wrens, Lizards, Coyotes, Ground Squirrels Aplenty","We love coming here, especially in the spring when the grounds are green and the jackrabbits and cottontails are racing around everywhere. In April we saw a ton of baby bunnies, and Saturday 7-22-2017 we counted 64 of them! You may also see a few coyotes, quail, cactus wrens, ravens, lizards and ground squirrels. Earlier this year we saw a flock of over 100 migrating turkey vultures circling above the park, which was a wonderful sight.Don't miss the visitor center, which offers lots of educational programs, plus photos to help you identify birds and plants.",SoCalRambler
40,Beautiful and Peaceful,This is amazing. The preserve is tucked right in the middle of neighborhoods. It's unique because Joshua Trees and Junipers live side by side which apparently is not the norm. The paths are nice and there are interpretative signs on the walkway. We saw lots of rabbits scurrying around and many birds. There is a visitor center but the hours are limited. It wasn't open. Really worth a stop if in the area.,MrsPickle
50,Relaxing Walk Among Native Flora and Fauna,"It was a very relaxing meandering through the paths laid out to display native vegitation, and also numerous native creatures. I was mildly surprised to see rabbits and other creatures crossing the paths and scampering off after checking out the strangers evading their turf. Good for all ages!",HowieNui
50,Beautiful Preserve Right in the Middle of Lancaster,"The Prime Desert Woodland Preserve in in Lancaster. We visited in April of 2016, when the weather was beautiful. Spent about an hour hiking around the trails, and stopped at the small visitor center. Certainly worth a stop to acquaint yourself with all the beautiful high desert has to offer.",SukiKunitz
40,Small but good:Yes yes! Parks are important.,This is a smallish park kinda hidden near a residential neighborhood.Small but good.Learn about the beauty of our desert and how the desert lifecycle works.Trails-paths are level and good for small kids as well as the elderly.Get out and enjoy nature by yourself or with family and friends.,Summerasalifestyle
40,Great place to walk,What a lovely area. So well taken care of...immaculate trails and a great variety of wild life.Perfect stop for an afternoon walk. Trail runs about 3 miles if you walk all of it.,mrt1955
50,Well worth the time,"Even on a dreary, overcast, misty, cold day! Saw a few rabbits and hares, a squirrel, and some massive crows or ravens. All among junipers and Joshua Trees. A nice, quiet place right in town. It's great!",BSPL
30,Family adventure,Great place to explain to the children why we need to preserve the land and animals. Great path for walking and running.,Melanie K
50,run with the girls,"first time i went didnt expect to feel like i did... even located in close range to houses it feels like your away from all the crazyness in life.... loves just being out there with my sisters, took some really good pictures....",viviana j
50,A Hidden Treasure,Love this place! One of my favorite peaceful walking place. My husband an I enjoy morning walks with the ever green Joshua trees and sightings of jackrabbits and birds of varied species.,Eancheta
50,Time Evening Walk under the Stars,"I have visited the Preserve for a few MOON WALKS... Evening under the stars. Great people, great host and enjoyed the summer breeze. Be sure to go inside the preserve to view the displays and make a donation.",MBrown28
40,Pretty as a Picture,When I have a little extra time I like to stroll through this preserve. It makes you feel like you are out of the city for a while. Depending on the season you will see several types flora and fauna. Very relaxing!,Sue H
40,Middle of the neighborhood,"I was caught off guard the first time I came across this location, but it is a nice preserve to accent how beautiful a desert can be. This is a great location to feel like you've traveled to do a nature walk, but it's actually up the street from the local YMCA.",CynJ22
50,Wonderful areas,This is a great little area to walk around on a cool day. Also it is a great backdrop for family pictures.,brandon F
50,Oasis in the middle of the desert (sub-division)!,"This park is extraordinary in that it is located within a community yet seems as though you are walking through a preserve in the middle of nowhere. Besides the great hiking trails (no bikes or pets allowed), there are scenic wooden bridges, landscape, and animals, especially jack rabbits. A museum is an added feature, which has restrooms. Beautiful place to hike!",marikesh
50,Nice Workout Plan,My wife and I would walk all over the paths to go exercising and the sights made it that much more pleasant...from rabbits to birds to insects.,caneskid28
50,A great walk with wonderful trails,"My husband and I got separated and finally met up again. Its easy to get lost but a lovely place to walk and hear your own thoughts. Its surprised me that this place is inside a suburb. A school is even pushed into the boundary of the preserve. There's lots of wild life that isn't afraid of humans. We got very close to jack rabbits, birds and lizards. The vegetation is thick in some areas and helps to block noises. It was lovely to see mothers with babies in strollers walking through here.",JaniceSeagraves
40,A Preserve Smack Dab in the middle of a Residential Neighborhood? Who knew?,"For quite some time I saw the sign but assumed the arrow would guide one out of town and up into the desert. NOPE! Within a residential neighborhood is an unexpected retreat for anyone seeking to walk, jog or picnic within the confines of a bird and wildlife sanctuary. The only negative critique is that you can see the homes and hear traffic. It's expected since the preserve is centered in the middle of a neighborhood. The landscape offers the potential for a family outing, photography and more. Pets are not allowed in order to protect the tranquility of the preserve. There were a few small dogs seen on the trails, but the signs explicitly state NO PETS.",RLDrPH
50,great self guiding walk.,We spent several (3-4) hours and did both loops. As of Apr 2016 the outer loop doesn't have leaflets for the marks. Amazing amount of diversity. Take your time and smell the flowers!,Paul H
50,Peaceful Refuge Pristine Desert Woodlands,The walking/ jogging trails are wonderful along with a history of the area. A group is fighting to get the city to buy the property adjacent which would really expand and include some great example of 100's of year old Joshua trees and Junipers. You won't find such a great preserve in any other desert town so easily accessible for everyone. They have lots of programs for families including Moon walks which include stargazing and animal species that live in the desert including birds of prey and tortoises. Don't miss visiting this beautiful place.,Victoria F
50,A hidden gem!,"I didn't know this place existed until I noticed it on google maps when I was looking for Von's. An excellent place for a short walk, especially with kids or dogs. I spent a good hour there reading the various information signs.I even spotted a coyote chasing a jack rabbit!",Michael T
50,WALKING TRAILS ARE EXCELLENT,"i walk in the woodland almost every day. i love the natural plants, trees and shrubs. i watch the jack rabbits playing and the bunnies hopping and then listen for the ravens conversing high above me in the joshua trees . it feels so good even tho homes surround it.",dorthbrom
40,Beautiful Views,This park is hard to find because it is around neighborhoods. This is a great place to take pictures because of the views. The hiking trails are short but the walk is beautiful.,Ting Y
40,Nice Short Walk,"It is a good place to take a short walk, maybe with the little kids. There is no hills. The building is fun for the little ones too. The people are friendly and helpful.",Khattykathy
50,Great Nature Walk,This is a fabulous place to visit right in the middle of a community. Not sure if many people know it is even there. I've gone on their Moon Walks and visited the visitors center several times and just love learning about the desert. You would be surprised how much is really out there. The desert isn't a wasteland and should actually see it up close you'll learn a lot.,Teri G
30,I Expected More,"Im all for preserving our natural resources, but this left me a little underwhelmed. My family kept telling it was a great place to take pictures, but it feels more like a piece of a vacant lot sectioned off and called a preserve. Lots of ants and rabbits running around! However, a good place to go walking.",VNSmith
30,Great walking trails,"The desert preserve is a wonderful place to walk by yourself or with friends! Well maintained trails in a quiet atmosphere. Jack rabbits and bunnies hop beside the trails, as you walk!!",Pam W
50,Beautiful and Clean,I live within walking/running distance and frequently go there to run. It is very clean and very quiet; I would recommend it to families.,kelkelsims
50,great place to walk and observe nature,"I am smitten with this place. The center itself (check opening hours) is kid friendly. Loved the picture of the huge Joshua tree that is no more. The nature walk along the dirt path is much easier on ""the joints"" and roadrunners and rabbits are pretty common. Not a place I like to walk in the summer heat, noone around and very hot. Absolutely morning and evening before sunset. The park is free.",7seekers
50,Great little find in the desert,"Great little place in the desert to go and view those clear, night skies. the high desert gets beautiful skies and on weekends many locals with telescopes to out to meet the public and let them look. The tours are fun in the moonlight and we loved visiting the museum area to learn about desert animals. Great romantic night's stroll with your honey on a full moon, offered almost every month, with an informative guide. The spring and fall evenings are just perfect weather! Loved it.",Tonia_Crews
40,Nature walk here I come ~,"I am not very big on taking walks, however the prime desert Woodland preserve has very easy walking nature trails that show your life in the desert as well as plants. Be sure to have your water in June, July, and August sometimes the weather can hit the triple digits.",A_V_Wedding_Lady
50,Lancaster's Hidden Gem,"This place is tucked away in a residential neighborhood but will allow for an up-close-and-personal experience with nature. The walk is very easy, so if you're looking for a strenuous hike this isn't the place, but it's perfect for strolling and getting some exercise and fresh air while checking out the Joshua trees and other dessert plant life. You're also sure to come across jackrabbits, rabbits, a huge variety of birds, lizards, and other desert creatures. My husband and I like to go at sunset as it's cooler outside and the view is gorgeous.",Erica F
50,"This is on my ""must see"" list for Lancaster","The Prime Desert Woodland Preserve is a very inauspicious place - its operated by the municipality, so the website is naturally not ""touristy"", the signage is underwhelming, and it's carved out of surrounding housing developments, but I would recommend that everyone visiting the Antelope Valley take time to visit.It's close and convenient, so there are no worries about getting lost in the desert.It is a 100 acre preserve without about three miles of trails winding through a beautiful desert landscape filled with Joshua Trees, Junipers and native brush. The trails are wide, flat and hard-surfaced. This was my longest walk since crushing my heel less than a year ago. I made it two miles with ease. It would be easy to use pushing a running stroller, but might be a challenge with a wheel chair. There are a lot of short loops that can be enjoyed without making the trip around the entire preserve.It abounds with wildlife (which I'm told can include rattlesnakes). If you stay on the trails there should be no problem. The trails are basically open dawn til dusk (check for exact times). Take water and wear comfortable shoes.The interpretive center is open limited hours, but is uniquely constructed of straw bales, so it's worth taking a look.You'll be glad you took the time to get to know the desert ecosystem a little bit better.",Nebraska Outback
50,Being from Oregon I had to learn to appreciate the desert,Overall you should appreciate the extensive amount of effort that it took to transform the desert into this place of scenic walkways. Incredible and quiet. A job well done so go enjoy it.,Ed E
50,Truly a Woodland Beauty,"This is a local's favorite. It is right by my house, and I escape here whenever I can. It is over one hundred acres of natives trees and habitat. Trails traverse the entire area, and many runners, including myself utilize this area. It is great for any kind of visit. Come on Sundays, and their visitor center is open. The visitor center itself is great, it was the first hay-bale constructed building in CA. The center shows much early AV history.",christian f
