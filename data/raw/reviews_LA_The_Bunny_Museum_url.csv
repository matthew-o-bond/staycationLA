50,A must for all bunny lovers!,"What a gem! There are SO MANY BUNNIES!!! An amazing place, sensory overload of everything ever made in the shape of a bunny. Totally amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susanbunny_8
20,"Awesome Cat, Huge Collection... Visitors not Very Welcome","If you want bunny immersion this is the place. The photos tell the story. BUT take cash ($10/ person), some rabbit litter to help with the poor overweight live rabbits housekeeping and a good attitude to deal with the bunny mistress and her crankiness. Maybe it was a bad day but she surely wasn't happy to see us. Would I take a friend there? Probably not, unless they were bunny mad and wanted to feel rejected. Hey, I can get that for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372rcr
50,Unique Experience at the The Bunny Museum,"What a gem!!!! This is a definite hidden museum find in Los Angeles. The information plaques everywhere are extremely interesting and informative. I had no idea how influential the bunny has been throughout history and across cultures. To be able to talk to the owner and collector was a unique experience, unforgettable and a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslyeKasoff
50,Hopping good fun,"This place has to be seen to be believed. If you're in the Pasadena area go to the north side and check this place out. Thousands of rabbits, bunnies, etc. See if you can find the real ones-they're there if you look close-big ones. They were even open Christmas day. A very unique, one of a kind place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenberetateam
40,Bunnies Galore,"Friends and I spent a quirky couple of hours along the hundreds is bunnies, mini to huge, at this unique hobby-gone- wild collection of bunnies, from pictures to stuffed to ceramic to REAL and everything you can imagine and never thought of.There are plenty of little restaurants around the Museum, and I will return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poodlesue
40,More bunnies than ever,"One woman's obsession , every type and color of bunnies imaginable in one place and more every day.Must be seen to be believed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
50,Bunny Museum is quirky!,"If you love Bunnies this is the place for you. They have over 35,000 displayed with three live, big bunnies in one of the rooms. The bunnies were huge and out so you could pet them if you chose. The room was very clean and no smell of bunnies or their boxes. The items are categorized by sections of this space. Most are old and worth seeing. My grandson, almost 14, was not thrilled but he went through all the rooms but didn’t stay where the real bunnies were as they gross him out. I enjoyed it and I think younger kids 5-8 will enjoy this museum. It definitely is quirky and I assume will gather dust in perpetuity. Dust bunnies as the founder explained to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25madgew
20,Amazing Idea. Needs assistance.,"As someone who constantly seeks out the unique, strange and bizarre, you would have thought I’d have visited The Bunny Museum years ago. For 19 years it was in the founders home, and I think that is what gave us pause (or in this case paws). But last year they made the move to their own brick and mortar museum! So it finally came time to give them a go! I was so excited!Now located in Altadena, we pulled into the driveway and there was literally no parking bit any signs or directions about parking. Finally we saw someone who told us to park at the Rite Aide around the corner. Ok.You aren’t allowed to bring in bags (which kind of sucks for parents of babies or toddlers), and since they make you park a ways away, you’re stuck into paying an extra dollar for them to hold your bag. The more I think about it, the more I call BS on that play. Children 4 and under are free though, so that’s something.It was exactly what I was expecting (and some of what I wasn’t, which I’ll get to in a minute)... wall to wall bunnies! Thousands (literally over 35k)!!! There are several rooms filled floor to ceiling with bunny things.One of the things my son was most looking forward to was the live bunnies and cats advertised. We went in that room and it was disgusting. It smelled like the litter boxes hadn’t been cleaned in three weeks. There were rotting bananas on the floor along with poop and hair balls. There was a nice couch in there with plastic on it that was showing bunny related films on a large TV screen. My son wanted to watch, and we did a bit, but I was getting more and more grossed out. The live bunnies were all hiding in places where you couldn’t touch them (they are advertised as the only thing you CAN touch in the museum). They are huge though! Very cool. The orange cat was cute too. He let us pet him. There was also a puzzle table for kids in that room, which my son wanted to try... but again... I had to get us out of the room.Upon visiting the upstairs area there were floor puzzles for kids. Maybe this will be ok I thought. But as I got on the floor I noticed how it was literally filthy with cat hair and dirt. Again I was grossed out. We left shortly after.It was tough reviewing The Bunny Museum because I want to support eccentric attractions. It takes guts to create and dedicate your life to something like this. Too many of these types of attractions are dying off. But that said, there is a certain responsibility that business owners... especially museum owners have to meet reasonable cleanliness expectations. This wasn’t unavoidable. It is just lack of effort/caring. I have cats. I have friends with bunnies... the smell and condition of this place isn’t a necessary side effect that comes with cats and bunnies. If you are open to the public, you as business owners have the responsibility to provide a clean environment for your patrons. Even more so when kids are your target audience!The large bunny outside, the cookie jars and the vintage signs and advertising were the highlights for me.I was very disappointed as I really wanted to rave about this place as enthusiastically as I rave about the idea. I hope they figure out a way to solve the problem. These types of places are a dying breed, and yes it’s because it takes so much work to keep them afloat, and I understand it’s a small operation... which is why it’s hard to give such a low rating. But I take pride in writing honest reviews, and my initial excitement was quickly replaced with the need to escape to fresh air. I hope it improves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Very Interesting,"I found it by typing museums near me into google maps . . . had a 1/2 hour to kill before meeting up with some friends. There were an overwhelming amount of bunnies, bunny memoriablia, and a few live bunnies. It is something to see. I would engage the owner in conversation, she had some interesting things to say about some of the exhibits. Her husband gave some informative facts about the bigger bunnies outside (Rose parade bunnies). The pictures speak for themselves. Some signage but not lots . . . it is interesting and informative tho'.They just moved, but looks like they could easily double the size. Unless you are a super bunny fanatic, I would say you can see what you need in about 1/2 hour. Parking is on side streets. I did think it was a bit on the expensive side for me. I check no for wheelchair accessible as there are bunnies everywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/regv2016
10,What?,"After using GPS to take us to the address, we discovered we were only a mere 4 miles away from the actual location. They moved about 2 months ago. Finally regrouped found the new place, which does not have any parking. (We parked in the shopping center down the street). Looked pretty cool and probably worth a quirky visit. But then discovered that if you pay the admission by credit card, you need to also pay the '""swipe fee"" of just over $2.00. Then the ladies must check their purses (and any other bags), the checking fee is $1.00 additional. Seems like we were being ""nickeled and dimed"" so we gave up ... saw the displays outside and left. It seems like they are discouraging business. Not worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBK33928
50,Fan,"Loved it. I was amazed. So much to see. Take a friend , they will love it. I'll be back soon with all my family. A very nice Father's Day gift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemariev61
