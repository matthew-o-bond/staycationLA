50,Nice Thai Temple to visit,"While visiting Los Angeles,it is recommended for those who like to see Wat Thai Temple is.This is a nice place to visit and take pictures of and also to enjoy the rich culture of this community.You will feel peace and serenity there for the time you will spend there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/info-ADLATours
50,Bring CASH. Thai Food...look no further!,"One of these days, I'll venture inside the temple and do a proper review...(feels weird to be inside of religious places when I'm not overly religious) but this visit was strictly for food. A previous adventure to the Grand Central Market left me disappointed. I thought to myself, what's good in the hood? HOLLYWOOD.... Wat Thai Temple! A place that I hadn't been to in two decades. Let's see if memory serves me correct.Parking was a nightmare (typical of LA) but your girl was determined to try the food from her childhood memories. A quick turn into the temple parking lot and you'll quickly find the food vendors. They're all lined along the perimeter hawking their specialties.Before you go on your gastro journey, you must first exchange cash for tokens. The vendors utilize a token exchange system so BRING CASH! I exchanged $20. It was enough for me to sample a bevy of thai delights.For old times sake, I ordered Pad Thai. Yes, a very safe non adventurous item, but it was delicious. BEST I've had so far....(Thai cuisine in OC is pretty lacklustre). It wasn't overly sweet as most tend to be and was served piping hot. Best $6 I ever spent. Next up, papaya salad with crab ($5). Its pounded papaya salad with sauces, tomatoes, string beans, and salted crabs. Perfectly balanced sweet, salty, tart and just the right umami from the tiny salted crabs (which I don't eat and pick out for personal preference). For dessert, went for the fried bananas. Served piping hot and the lady hooked it up. Usually they're 5 pieces for $3 but the homie did a solid and gave us like 9 pieces. We ended the visit splitting a Thai Tea ($2...it was ok.) and a Thai style halo halo drink ($3, which was bomb AF). All in all, a very good and frugal way to sample thai food on a lazy Sunday. The prices are pretty reasonable....(I got 2 dishes here for the price of 1 curry dish in Grand Central Market) .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ensorcell
50,Authentic Wat Thai in LA,"I felt like I was back in Thailand as soon as I arrived. Make sure you cover your arms and legs if going into the Buddhist temple to worship and be blessed by monks. They donâ€™t ask for money but gladly accept offerings to their temple. If you kneel to pray or be blessed do not point your toes or feet towards the Buddha or the monks, as it is disrespectful. They are very welcoming, warm people and I love the way being at Wat Thai makes me feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korapeters
40,Cultural Experience,"This Thai temple (Wat) is located in North Hollywood, CA (off of the 170 FWY). The Wat is always open to the public, but can get pretty busy during specific cultural events, as it also serves as an unofficial gathering place for the local Thai community in LA and vicinity. Monks are always on hand to offer prayers and accept offerings from the worshipers. There are also Thai classes (language, musical, culture etc) during the weekends. Don't be (pleasantly) surprised if these cute little kids put out their wonderful performances in the plaza for you to admire. Do be sure to dress appropriately ( be respectful - no bare shoulders, arms or shorts) and wear easily removed foot ware. Visitors are expected to remove their shoes before entering the main temple and all other outlining smaller shrines.There are numerous food stalls during the weekends, offering a wide variety of tempting food similar to the famous street food fare in Bangkok. The vendors do not accept cash so you need to buy ""tokens"" from a nearby booth for the food purchase and can exchange them back for cash if you have any unused tokens.This Wat is very beautiful and is highly recommended as a cultural experience without having to fly all the way out to Thailand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suwannac2016
40,Beautiful old temple with Rural Thai food court,"My friend recommended to visit the food court of the temple. Food court on weekends has a variety of booths serving Thai food. Many of the items are not common at restaurants, so they can be a special treat. On a hot summer day, it feels a lot like an outdoor bazaar in rural Thailand, including the loud, out-of-tune folk singer on stage that Furang will have trouble tolerating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MithilaNepal
50,A culture of peace and smiles,"This Thai temple will make you feel what it's like being in a temple in Thailand for those who are planning to travel to Far East. Not only it's a temple, there are food stalls on the weekend - very inexpensive with no sales tax. The most authentic you can find!Everyone is welcome at the temple. See the true Thai architecture to understand the richness of details, colors, shapes, and proportions. One of the largest Buddha statues outside of Thailand, not like a fake sculpture at Tao in New York and Las Vegas, you'll find yourself in a different world with peace and respect. Though it can feel a bit intimidating for being in a place so foreign to western culture, but as Thais are known for providing the best hospitality; they'll make you feel most welcome at this place.If you're looking to learn and explore the Thai culture, this temple has it all.Offering ceremony 'Tak Bat' by giving food and other necessities to monks are on every first Sunday of the month and special Thai holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lexter266
40,Cool looking temple,This is our first time to visit Thai temple. What a great expereince. Interesting architecture. I took lots of pictures here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TommyT15
50,Authentic Thai experience,"I'm not Thai but have been to Thailand a couple of times and I feel in Thailand when I visit this colorful temple. It is authentic Thai. Visitors should respect the main Buddhist traditions: shoes off, no expressions of affection in the temple - definitely don't touch a Thai person on the head - and don't point your feet towards the Buddha statues if you squat down on the floor. I recently visited at a weekday lunchtime and walked into the dining rooms where the Temple shares unused food given earlier in the day to the monks as merit. I was made welcome to sit down and share some delicious leftover Thai food. I am not sure if this was unique as nobody spoke English and I was not able to ask. I was not asked for money but made a small donation inside the Temple. Those of you who are familiar with the Thai people will know of their extraordinary generosity. I have a feeling I was just a lucky duck on the day. Anyway, don't count on having a similar experience, but do enjoy a peaceful and calm (maybe enlightening) interlude at Wat Thai. What a treat to have such a place in crazy LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/figgie32313
50,A nice break from our Hectic day.,"My wife and I enjoyed visiting this temple and relaxing a bit from our otherwisehectic day in LA. The temple looks like some temples in Thailand, it has the statues and other figures to show the Buddhist culture and lifestyle. It lookslike a great place to come to for locals and visitors. The location was handy for us tofind, as we were in Thai Town, and it was only about 15 minutes away. We were glad that we located this temple and spent some time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarveyMarshall
50,A haven of peace and welcome,"First things to say, I am neither Thai nor a Buddhist.This beautiful example of a reasonably sized Thai temple (wat) is on a busy road in the Fernando Valley. There's the usual large temple up some stairs, or ramps. There are also several smaller temples of various sizes in the grounds.This is an active, working temple. As always everyone is welcome as long as the basic rules (no shoes, don't point toes towards the Buddhas if you kneel/sit).It is just so peaceful in there. You can light a candle if you wish. You can take and light a joss-stick for planting in a sand tub outside the door. You can sit in one of the chairs for as long as you like.I will revisit before my weeks in LA are up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevetupper
50,A very cultural experience,"This place has a mystical vibe and peaceful energy about it that is very similar toThailand and I recommend everybody to visit the location. They serve food on the weekends that is pretty cheap but a little greasy but very tasty. It is strictly there type of food from noodles, soups curries deserts coconut drinks and more. You can visit and speak to the monks and Thai's there that will talk to you will share there knowledge. The people are so friendly. The temple is huge and you can't miss it if you drive by. Parking at times can be difficult especially during there 2 festivals in April and November usually during the weekends. If your visiting Los Angeles go and cheak it for a hour or two. Thailand and the people are my favorite in the world. Enjoy, Dave",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davenorwoods
40,An interesting place for tourists and locals alike,"Wat Thai is a Buddhist temple located in the San Fernando Valley. Los Angeles has a huge Thai population, many living in North Hollywood, just south of this temple. The best time to go is on Sundays or during a Thai festival. Last year, I visited the temple during the Thai New Year (Songkran festival) which happens mid-April and it was pretty amazing - live music, lots of people, tons of cheap food stalls.On Sundays, there is a modest food court downstairs that sells typical Thai fare like Pad Thai, papaya salad and iced coffees. Most of the dishes are are around $3-7. The proceeds go to the monks and the temple.Parking is available on the streets in the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as at the Temple - entrance is on Cantara Street. If you go during a festival or holiday, expect to park several blocks away and walk (or follow signs for their parking shuttle).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shakeitsgreat
