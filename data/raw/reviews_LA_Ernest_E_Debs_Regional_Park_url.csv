50,Turtles with a view,We enjoy coming here because it's not too difficult to hike the wide fire roads. It's a popular park but never ever crowded where you can't find a parking spot. Our reward is viewing the turtles and fish in the small lake on top of the hill. Some hikers will bring their dogs which seem to enjoy the lake also by jumping in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA

40,Easy Hike with a Good View,"This park has very easy hike trail is. The beginning is steep but after the first quarter mile, it flats out. From the entrance to the far end which reaches the city roads, it is about 2 miles (not including the western trail which is a HUGE loop). Nothing scary, nothing too demanding. Trail condition is excellent, and there is sufficient shade during fall (end of October). Wear comfortable shoes and bring two bottles of water :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachtheMage
50,"Great Park for hiking, biking, or spending time with the munchkins","Beware the loch errr lake errr pond monster... OMG its a baby Nessie! I know it since I got a photo of it. It was about 4-6 inches long and had a huge hump on its back and its head was sticking out of the water an inch ahead... ohhh wait... it was a turtle... or was it O_oHowever this is another great spot to go for a stroll, a hike, or a run. Want a place to take the kids to explore a bit, you can do that here as well. At the Audubon Center or at the giant grass park area next to the main parking lot. This park is riddled with multiple trails with vertical terrain and distance challenges. The ups and downs here are fantastic for a workout.Pro Tip: Do not park in the main lot (if they charge there, I am not sure) but at the Audubon Center or at one of the offshoots here.There are multiple vistas presenting a great look at DTLA, Pasadena, Glendale, and the SGV. These spots are something that you will just stumble upon randomly. There are great spots for a picnic (like the gazebo on top of one of the hillocks or next to the above mentioned loch). You can ride a mtn. bike here for a great workout, but remember to give way for the hikers and walkers.Overall I was quite impressed with the mixed trails and terrain here. Definitely a great easy way to get a workout in that will whip your butt! Also as a heads up the trails vary from loose dirt, scree, rock, asphalt, concrete, and hard packed dirt. Check it out sometime this place is a great way to spend a few hours working out or finding some nature in the midst of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schel74
