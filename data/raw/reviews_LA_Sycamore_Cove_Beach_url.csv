50,"Cute, peaceful beach","This is a small, cute beach along the Pacific Coast Highway just across the highway from the Sycamore Canyon campgrounds. It's a separate attraction though and has its own parking lot and fees. It's not like the campground, you don't camp here, it's just a nice beach to stop for a picnic or to enjoy the water.Parking is quite reasonable by California standards; $3/hour or you can pay $6 for the whole day (the park closes at sunset).There are just a few amenities here, a bathroom and several porta-potties. If you're wanting more attractions and restaurants, go to Santa Monica. If you want camping, cross PCH and stay at Sycamore Canyon and then hike to the beach when you want.This beach is good for a quick stop for a couple hours in a place that's not too crowded. The beach is blocked on either end from impassable terrain so it really is a cove. There's enough space to support the amount of traffic in the parking lot, but limited enough that it wouldn't be like the bigger beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BernieDy
