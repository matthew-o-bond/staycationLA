50,Great Market,"This is a huge place with lots of great items from succulents, antiques, Indian jewelry, homemade items. We spent about 4.5 hours to walk the whole thing and that included walking a couple of the isle twice because some vendors hadn’t arrived when we first started. According to Fitbit, we walked approx 6 miles. I would definitely come to this market again.Cost - entry fee:$12.00 5:30a - 6:30a$7.00 6:30a - close (I think it closes at 3;00pNote: I would not pay the extra fee. We arrived at 6:30 and 1/3 of the vendors hadn’t arrived yet, another 1/3 were still setting up and most didn’t want to be bothered so save your money and go in at 6:30.Things to know -- bathrooms are located under the football seating stands.- the isles are narrow so you can shop both sides.- It gets crowded around 10:00- Not many food vendors so bring your own snacks and plenty of water.- Parking is free and close- Not as big as the Rose Bowl flea market but I liked it better because the vendors seemed to be more relaxed, easier access, cheaper entry fees, and free parking.Have fun and enjoy the day!",AZMesaFamily
50,"So Much Stuff, Such Tired Feet",We come about twice or three times a year and are never disappointed. Always something new and interesting to view. Don't be shy about haggling! You never know unless you ask.,ohzonejoe

50,Great Mix! Superb!,"Great mix of stalls.We loved the band, great touch.The outstanding stall for us though was the popcorn.I forget the name of the couple running the stall but they have been at the market for 20 odd years. I would go back to California just for there popcorn.",DavidBuckleyGM
40,If you are into junk,Nice place to visit if you are into junk. Lots of dealers. Mostly vintage and smalls. Entrance 6 dollars. You can get a discount coupon in the internet,Starviagera
40,Fun treasure...lots of walking!,"Like a 21st century archaeological site, a sampling of the goods at the flea market will offer treasures from our past! There's something for every interest, so arrive early for best selection and visit late when vendors are in the mood to bargain. Wear comfy shoes, a hat for shade, and a couple bottles of water...and you're set.",mj92159
50,"Really is ""The Best""","I visit this market either as a vendor or a buyer every month. I drove from Scottsdale to Long Beach and love to attend this place. It is very well organized, the vendors are knowledgable and friendlyly, the food is good and you will find what you are looking for. . I have been to the Rose Bowl and Ventura markets but Long Beach beats the others. I wish we had a good one here in Arizona so I wouldn't need to drive 12 hrs back and forth to attend. You won't be sorry if you go.",63MartinD17
40,FUN TO EXPLORE AND PEOPLE WATCH,"I kept thinking this looks like my garage! A huge collection of everything old and fun that you could think of. Some of the booths looked like a photography museum. Really enjoyed walking around and browsing, great stories from the vendors and fun to people watch as well.Come with exact change and avoid the line-up at the ticket booths.Washrooms were a bit dingy and could use more regular maintenance.",SenorGancho
50,Over 800 Vendors,"Something for everyone, from Mid-century Modern to Art Deco and everything in between. A must visit place for collectors. Open every third Sunday.",Peter T

40,A great & cheaper? alt to the ROSEBOWL mkt?,"A great flea & antique market. There's similar & the same vendors at Rosebowl market too but I found some cheaper items here than at the Rosebowl, it's only slightly smaller, only food is a truck outside or terrible prepackaged stuff from two concessions under the huge concrete stand structure. I'd advise getting there before 08:00 as parking is tight & it gets hot & busy there after 08:00 in the Summer months.Take water a food...it's a long hike around all the stalls.",TigerandScruffy
50,"Best around, very enjoyable!",Found this while on vacation! We had went to the So Cal motorcycle swap meet and stumbles upon this in the afternoon. We lived it and did purchase a few items looking forward to returning!,evo_cowgrl
50,"Take a Trip Down Memory Lane, and Enjoy!","WOW. The Long Beach Antique Market is STILL a great find in of itself and a great place to find that thing that you need from your childhood or past. What a great adventure, a great day outside, a great day looking and buying the perfect anything. Take a friend. Take your Mom, she will know what that ""thing"" was used for or what the heck it is!",JAR411
40,A great experience,"The Long Beach Antique market is so beautiful and there is so many unique pieces of art and jewellery to buy, and being right by the Pacific ocean, one cannot help but be filled with awe and wonderment. A great experience!",thetagirl
50,My favorite market in SO Cal,"I've been shopping here for 5 years and I am NEVER disappointed. It is a hoppin' happenin' market. Film crews are here regularly because of it's proximity to LA... There are so many vendors I buy from who know me now and pull things out when I visit.. I never leave disappointed. There are a LOT of vendors, not as many as Rose Bowl, but a lot.. and always good stuff. You need to know your prices, they can be a little high, but I always find good deals. It's all about the hunt for me anyway. My favorite way to spend a Sunday...",karansimoni
50,Take a visit to the Past!,"Every Third Sunday of the month I walk the isles to find new (to me) Treasures from the past. You can find Antiques to items from Granny's Attic to crafted art items (fountains) jewelry, purses, vintage clothing and hats, cameras, plants and my personal favorite : Antique Jewelry and Collectable items from my favorite Vendors Alex and Michelle ( look for the blue awnings navy draped tables. ) They always have something great to offer and are super nice and honest. One can find vintage furniture, Art, records, cameras, tools , toys whatever you can imagine and then some things you forgot existed ! Wear sunscreen and a hat as it is outdoors. You can come early or later .. Some pack it in at 2 PM. There is a good stand for snacks ( no gourmet food here but pretzels and Beer or Softdrinks. Decent restrooms are available. Come alone as couples or with family. There is something for everyone! Great fun for all. I have seen them film ""Flea Market Flip"" here.",beachbabelagunabeach
50,Amazing,Wow amazing I am so glad I made this a must in my trip to Los Angeles. What amazing stuff and if you are lucky you will also be amazed to see tv personalities. Beautiful people who collect and sell at the stalls too. This is the only reason I have to revisit Los Angeles.,Hfanau
50,Worth the Trip,"I have been to Brimfield, Mass Antique Show, I have been to the Longest Yard Sale on 127. But this is the place to come. I flew from South Florida to get to LA for the Rosebowl Flea Market and the Long Beach Antique Market. It was worth the trip. Bring good walking shoes, CA$H.. leave your strollers and small children at home. I will be back",posson213
50,Antique and flea market,"was in Long Beach for work, was able to attend the Long Beach Antique market. This is one of the better flea markets I have been to, not over run with people selling new cheap items.",fivermillions
50,Best Vintage Market!,"I adore this market and try to get there every month. The people are fun, both sellers and buyers -- and there are incredible deals to be had. BONUS: they sell beer!",Janine W
40,A large selection available,We recently visited the Long Beach Antique Market at Long Beach City College. It offered a good number of venders with a good amount of selection to choose from. A little expensive for the entry fee and probably because it is close to the holidays more retail prices than swap meet prices. It comes in a distant second to the Rose Bowl Antique Swap Meet on the second Sunday of each month.,thibbs1955
40,Flea Market,"We loved this antique flea market. We were there at 6:30 and waited in line for about 15 minutes. All the booths were not set up yet and by the time we walked the whole thing 5 hours later we went back to the beginning. The only thing we didn't like were the lack of sitting somewhere to rest! Lots of antiques, new and different things. Would go again.",Sandra P
50,Fun day at the antique market,"Great way to spend a Sunday in Long Beach. Great items, vendors, food & prices.Check it out on my blog http://www.closet-creep.com/",Kara L
40,A Fun Escape...,"I really enjoy this place. It reminds me a lot of how the Rose Bowl used to be before it became overly commercialized and overpriced. Long Beach Antique Market (LBAM) is a bit smaller, but big enough to find anything you could imagine and more; the selection here is plentiful. The Vendors and fellow patrons are quite pleasant. Being here reminds me of traveling through time in a pleasant way and I enjoy wandering the isles… Parking is free and plentiful. There’s an entrance fee of $6, which doubles should you choose to arrive before 6:30am. Cash is king, although some vendors will take credit cards or even checks; there’s an ATM by the concession area for a service fee of $5, in addition to what your bank may charge.The market is held on the 3rd Sunday each month and some months where there are 5 Sundays, as is the case with June this year, its also on the 5th Sunday.This place is really worth visiting. Just take care to prep for full exposure of the sun with sunscreen, a hat and plenty of cold water or you may purchase refreshments or snacks on site. This is truly a lovely place to spend a Sunday afternoon.",NovieW
