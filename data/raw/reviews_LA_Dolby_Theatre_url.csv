50,Beautiful facility,Theatre is beautiful and has good audio. The tour of facility was good and the history as well as Oscar trivia was fun.,Elizabeth T
50,Escape To Margaritaville,Fun and entertaining. Dolby Theatre is beautiful! Terrific seats. Amazing sound. A bit of a walk from parking garage to theatre. Valet parking was quick and efficient.,Karen C
30,Dolby Theatre,The Dolby Theatre is the venue of the annual Academy Awards ceremony where Hollywood's rich and famous will grace its halls to receive their Oscars. It is adjacent to Highland Center shopping mall and entertainment complex.,Wander & Wonder
50,Escape to Margaritaville,Cute show ... love Jimmy Buffet songs! Easy parking although paying in advance would have been better. Good acoustics at the Dolby. Audience didn't have much energy for a Saturday night though.,Nancy
30,Dolby Theatre tour not worth the cost,"The Dolby Theatre tour was disappointing, and not worth the $25 (plus tax) charged per person. This tour involves little more than allowing you into the theatre to look at it and take some pictures (and by the way, the theatre is less impressive in person than on TV- carpets need replacement, etc). We were also disappointed in our tour guide, who was not into the tour and just wanted to get it over with, and seemed annoyed with any questions (we went to the 10:30 AM tour on Thursday). In fact due to the rush it took even less time than the advertised 30 minutes.",Christopher A
50,Lovely to feel a part of it,Awesome experience it was lovely to be apart of the Oscars even if only from a distance it was still closer than watching at home in UKGot to stand across the road in the rain on Oscar night but went rd the building the next day,Sallyalfie
40,ost interesting new venue in LA,"Glad that I attended a [performance in this massive venue. Something very different for LA compared to other places with a bit more character. I think it is not that ADA facile and persons with challenge may find it hard to negotiate, enter and maneuver.",Judith A
50,Marvellous auditorium,"Interesting to learn of its relative novelty, being unveiled only in late 2001. It is a great space with modern facilities.It is most famous for being the home of the annual Oscars ceremony since 2002.",permia
40,Feeling like an Oscar nominee,The feeling was just awesome if you're someone who watches AGT and Oscars Awards. Being able to experience what they do (although in a less glamorous state) is still an experience to remember.,jaylene2020
50,The tour was good,"The 30 minute tour was worth the money at least for us. We got to be on the stage and a photo was taken of us while we were there. We also got to sit on the benches beside the ""starts"" (cardboard pictures anyway) and got the tour of the backstage areas, elevator, balconies etc. We heard the history and some interesting anecdotes. The tour was all we were hoping for.",TPAT75
40,See where the celebrities go to win their big awards!,My hotel was right next to this Theatre so I took a tour. That day there was only two others in our group so we had a very personal tour of the place. It was very interesting to see as I have only seen it on tv. It looks very different as they set up many props etc. to make to look glamorous. You get to sit where your fav actor or actress sat and walk on the stage. The tour was very good and informative.,Ryan D
50,I love the term ‘Oscar Host’ anyway...,"I had myself pictured on the stage of the world’s most famous theatre. It was a highly enjoyable experience for somebody who aspired to write no more than one screenplay in their life; something I’m proud to have accomplished. As you can see from the ‘drooping eyes’ on my still to be completed chest; Ricky Gervais’s wist playing Personal Trainers are still getting in the way of my fat burning targets at Fitness First but I’m still well on my way and enjoyed the experience of being eight months away from playing the 40 something in a mid life crisis due to star as Batman in Warner Brothers next finest outing. You see I’m not the guy who gives Gervais’s ‘Perty Hangers’ a cult status in Hollywood. I had booked tickets for the Rams v Ravens so my next stop was the next great theatre in LA: the Memorial Coliseum. Which is why I missed Tom Hanks in real life on Saturday Night Live! (Or some talk show). The next day the main guest was the guy who wants to be President Yang; and tickets had gone. But at least I had my photograph taken near where Bardem sat. The Dolby is a beautiful theatre and as they pulled down a nasty multi story car park to build it, I couldn’t approve more. It was an awe inspiring experience which I would thoroughly recommend. I agree with Sir Ian McKellen... if you’re gay anyway (like myself): I don’t see why not...",Jassim Al-Kanani
10,Lack of Communication,"We didn't even get off the ground with this one. I booked through Trip Advisor but the wrong tour was sent to me and try as I may to find someone to sort it out for me those attempts failed miserably. No help line; no phone number; no customer service. I managed to cancel the tour and a refund was effected. I was bitterly disappointed of missing out on the Dolby Theater Admission tour as this was one of the 'must do' tours I was looking forward to. Unfortunately, tours were not available over the weekend.",capricornchris19
50,Fun to walk around,"My husband and I had lots of fun simply walking around at night. If you're a fan of the Academy Awards, you have go to here and simply walk up the steps. There are columns honoring every Best Picture winner in the history of the Oscars.",Tracy C
50,Interesting,"We booked a tour around the Dolby theatre. The main event of the year being the Oscars. The tour only lasted 30 minutes but it was really worth it. Learnt so much about the Oscars past and present. We got took around back stage and on the stage. A good tour but don’t want to tell too much so go and hear all about it, it’s really good. A good tour guide.",Nomad5522
50,American Influencer Awards,"I was here for the AIA's event and was not disappointed. This is a classic, elegant Hollywood theater. Many events are held here, the most famous being The Academy Awards. The whole area surrounding the theater is fun, a very happening part of Hollywood Boulevard. There is a great shopping mall connected to the theater as well...a fun place to explore!",chongo49
50,world fame Hollywood theater,The prominent live performance auditorium of Hollywood..famous for Red Carpet ceremony during Annual Academic awards for best Movies and performance..the Complex include a Shopping complex and also a viewing point for Hollywood sign,vipin k
40,Must for film fans,You can walk into the Foyer where the Oscars take place - all the Best Film winners back to the 1940s are listed on the walls. Free entry and just next to the walk of fame - there is a great view of the Hollywood sign if you through the next door shopping centre!,WCookie
30,Underwhelming,"Don’t expect too much for the price. This was an interesting if all be it short tour of the Oscars theatre. And when I say short I mean it - we were in there for approx 20 mins.We got to explore the routes taken by the stars on Oscar night and see a real Oscar, even if it was behind a glass window (do the Paramount Studios tour as they give you the opportunity to actually hold an Oscar). We also got to sit in the theatre. However it is a working theatre and the day we were there they were still clearing up after The America’s Got Talent final and so it was a right mess! Streamers everywhere, seats missing etc, so we don’t feel we got the full experience. The guy who showed us round didn’t help either as he was very uninterested and was clearly just going through the motions, making various comments about how relieved he was that we were just a small group. Hardly inspiring. I’d read other reviews that said they had been on the stage itself and there is a picture of this on their website, but we didn’t and I don’t know why. If this isn’t part of the tour it’s a real shame as this would elevate this tour into something very special, instead it’s just an average and underwhelming experience. I would rather pay twice the money and get to see so much more.",ElizabethF1209
10,Don’t waste your time,"Don’t waste your time. The tour was $25 and lasted 19 minutes. All we saw were lobbies, a hallway, and walked into the mezzanine of the theatre. It’s a tough to choose the best part of the tour... For me it could of very well been the elevator ride to the second level. The tour guide was rushing through the tour, providing no relevant information whatsoever. He also abruptly told Asian tourists to stop taking pictures. They clearly did not understand him so he elevated his tone and was visibility irritated. At least the tour provided partial parking validation.Note: I had taken this foot in 2009, and we had walked around the whole building, including backstage and on the stage. They don’t do anything close to this anymore.",Nico
50,Nice tour,"Nice tour, fairly quick but neat to see the theater, it was beautiful! Our tour guide was very nice, no bathrooms so go before the tour.",Donna R
50,Short & Sweet,"The tour was around 30-35 mins long. All guided tour. Our guide was very information and told us a lot of interesting background stories. They were setting up the stage for American Got Talent - it was so cool to see it!At the end, we were given a Dolby Theatre Postcard as a little souvenir - CUTE!!",VanessaStar89
30,Interesting but overpriced,"It was exciting to see the space where they film the Oscars and learn some of the details, as well as to see an actual Oscar. However, $25 for a 25-minute tour was a bit high. Several years ago, I took a tour of the Los Angeles Music Center, which included the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion and the Walt Disney Center. That was a much better tour, and it was free.",sfcyclistwriter
40,Impressive inside. Oscar’s locafion,From the outside it looks old but go inside which is free and you’ll notice the stairs used in the Oscar’s. Some nice stores inside as well so have a walk around and take photos in the stairs.,Craig D
40,Nice feeling of the Oscar awards,"By the moment you visit Dolby theatre you get those kind of goosebumps for walking where Hollywood stars are celebrating every year the Oscars. From the theatre perspective it isn’t something extraordinary, although from that moment, every time you would look at the Oscars on TV, you will say internally “Oh, I have been there”! And trust me, it is just amazing 😊",Gerasimos D
30,Interesting,"We did it as part of our Go card LA so the admission was included! It was very interesting but it only lasted 30 minutes, the tour guide told some interesting stories!It is not a must to see in LA but if you have a GO LA card worth a look around!",Rsi15
50,Good venue for a concert.,saw Franco DeVita perform. Beautiful theatre and comfortable seating. The price for the concert was worth everything.,Gloria D
40,Theater tour,"Ticket prices were a bit high for a tour that lasted just under 30 minutes. However, the theater is beautiful and our tour guide did seem to be well informed about facts related to the theater.",tourist
30,Hmmmmm nothing like what I thought.,This theatre is nice but looks much more fancy on tv. Too many people trying to scam everyone. It was a building and location was easy to see with the stars.,Baybug2012
40,Theatre Tour,"Matt our guide was very good. He made tour very interesting bringing the oscars to life. We went onto the stage, up in the famous lift and into box 14. Very good tour - part of LA card trips.",Aidene W
30,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"My family recently went to the Dolby Theatre and were so disappointed with the venue. It was boring, unattractive and did not have the best acoustics.We were in row Q which is the last row before the upper level. It was very warm. We could feel no air circulation.There are doors at each end of that row that kept opening and closing. The problem? They had bright lights on in the lobby that were distracting and rather annoying. The doors made noise every time they closed.We had a difficult hearing the comedy performer and, there was no large screen so that you can see the performer better.There was no major announcement after people were seated to not take photos during the performance. I believe the lack of which led to people around us taking photos, some with flash. Early into the seating process, and before some people were actually in the room to be seated they just had one person from our side of the room tell people not to take photos. He could barely be heard.Besides that, it is a beast to get to the theatre. You must do research and have a well thought out plan.We agreed we would never go again.",TravelPo11

40,Check Out While in Hollywood,This is right on Hollywood and worth a visit. There is the theater but also shops. You can feel that you are in the movies here.,LiketoeatCincinnati
50,Amazing to See,"We had booked a 30 minute guided tour which was included with our Go LA cards. The tour is really interesting getting to see inside such a famous theatre. We were not allowed to take any photos in the auditorium as there was an act rehearsing for a show later that day, but it is gorgeous! And huge! I only wish the tour was a bit longer than 30 minutes but it was definitely good to see!",Emily
40,A famous and popular place,"A famous place for Hollywood activities. We were late by some time so can't view from inside. The plaza itself is very good place to visit. Eat, drink, hang around.",dr.pragnesh Vachharajani
40,Shen Yun at the Kodak Theater,"Our daughter bought us tickets to the show. The theater is beautiful. It’s right in the middle of a shopping center. There are lots of displays of the Academy Awards, as they are held there. The ushers and servers were all very pleasant. We had a great experience.",TonyP20
10,Did NOT respect those who were on time!,"My daughter and I went here to see Shen Yun. recently. The show itself was beautiful, what I could see of it without a thousand distractions. The ushers and many late comers made this experience horrible. We got there, on time, which the show said on its website to please arrive early, for the show will start on time (and it did), and late comers will NOT be permitted to avoid distractions.Well, Dolby's workers didn't care. Through almost the entire show they constantly allowed late comers in, thus making my daughter and I to have to constantly get up to let them by. (We sat on the end of the row.)The ushers also would shine their little flashlights on everyone so the late comers could find theirs seats, while every time someone would enter and leave, the seats would flip up with a loud, squeaky sound, AND the exit doors kept slamming.This was so incredibly rude and unacceptable, especially for the prices the seats were for the show. Think they cared? Nope. After the show, it was crazy crowded in the halls and lobby. Rude people everywhere, could barely take a picture and get out. This place is ONLY well known for hosting the Oscars. Other than that, its a fancy looking dump. Will never go there again. Never.",jro483
30,LA,"It was closed. The location seemed a bit dingy but I’m sure is all clean, bright and sparkling for the night of the Oscars.",JohnandMichelle87
40,Overall nice experience,"Interesting information received from the guide, the energy is invigorating and contemporary history of major shows is instructive.Awesome sensation to sit on the same chairs as many Oscar winners.The only downside is that entrance looks like an old obsolete and unfashionable cinema .",Mike1232013
50,It's where the Oscars are hosted - Awesome!,While visiting Hollywood my family and I took a tour of the Dolby theatre and had an amazing experience. They will continue hosting the oscars here for another 50 years. This theatre is amazing to see and walk through. Everyone should try seeing this if you are visiting Hollywood.,jesse.lodge
50,Amazing tour,"Such a good experience that I’d recommend to anybody - both adults and children alike. We took 40+ students on a tour as part of a school trip to America and we were all blown away. For someone who is not particularly fussed about the Oscars, the tour was still so, so interesting. The tour guides were extremely knowledgable and put you fully in the shoes of the celebs who attend the oscars. You get to see every part of the Theatre; the lobbies, the stage and everything backstage too. Would definitely recommend taking half an hour out of your day to do this tour!",macas90
40,A must for movie buffs,"Tour was short - around 20 minutes - just us and another couple. I would say it's expensive for what it is, but if you've watched the acadamy awards for years, it's worth it to see it in person. Now I'll know what I'm looking at next year at the awards.",KenandRamona
40,Academy Awards Location,We stood on the same stage where the Academy Awards are won!! How exciting!! Loved checking out the areas where the stars get interviewed and where they hang out afterwards!! Felt like the tour was a little rushed and the tour guide could have taken the time to allow us to enjoy every moment of the tour that we paid for.,CheDenn
50,Historic venue.,"I always watch the Oscars so it was a no-brainer to see this venue in person while I was visiting Los Angeles. I did the 30 minute tour and the tour guide was very informative and hilarious (I forgot her name). Our group was just 4 people including me so we were able to ask lots of questions about the venue! The only people, I think, that would enjoy this venue are the ones who are interested in the Oscars and its history. Some other TV programmes' live shows also happen here (America's Got Talent, etc.)",Apocypha
50,Fantastic visit of the home of Oscar with tour guide Alex,"Last Sunday we had a tour in the Dolby Theater.

50,nutcracker at the dolby,dec 2018- first time at the Dolby theater (have only seen it on tv during the oscars). Beautiful theater- seats are staggered so easy to see the stage. Had great seats. Convenient by bus or subway. Staff helpful and polite. Will definitely attend other events held there.,nicenurse1
50,Home of the Oscars,"The Dolby Theater, right in the heart of Hollywood, is the home for many events, the most famous being the Oscars. We had a chance to attend an open house there and actually go on stage and pretending to receive that famous golden statue. The Dolby is a large modern facility with comfortable seats, private boxes to be seen in, and great acoustics. Designed like traditional opera houses, there are four levels with restrooms and bars on each level and elevators to avoid the climb.If you get the chance, visit the ""winner's walk"" on the third level, where the Oscar winners go after receiving their awards to sign that year's poster and cross into the next door hotel for to do interviews with the press. Parking is underground. ample, accessible from Highland and Orange and runs $3/hr and a flat $18 for most events. Lots of nearby restaurants, clubs, stores will validate for two (2) hours. Check out the entrance columns for a listing of every best picture winner and the Oscar shop for souvenirs.",Rich A
50,Live from the Red Carpet!,"We didn’t take a tour, but thoroughly enjoyed walking the stairs and the area outside the theatre where we’ve seen stars arrive for the Oscars. Also fun to see all of the Best Pics immortalized on the theater, including Green Book. Worth exploring.",Hilary H

10,Not Worth Watching!,This was the worst ever Academy Awards Show - so disappointed! I watch every year but not sure I’ll ever watch again!,Beth P
30,Worth a quick look at the home of the Oscars..........,"If you are visiting Hollywood Boulevard to see the Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theatre it's also worth checking out the facade of the impressive Dolby Theatre. Not a great deal to see, but as the home of the Oscars it's definitely worth a quick look.",Ste M
50,West Coast Adventure,Visited the Dolby Theatre and enjoyed the tour which was about 30 minutes. It was all set up for Americas Got Talent and it was cool to see how it all works. Worth a visit if your in the area.,Andy P

50,"If you watch the Oscars, this is a must do","The tour is only about 30 minutes and is really an empty theater....but...the one for the Oscars. You see where the red carpet will be, then into the main theater, sit in the seats, go on stage, and follow the route that winners go to meet the press after their win.If you love movies and watch the Oscars...this is great. Otherwise, it is just a very large, well designed theater.",lrb881

40,Where the Oscars take place red carpet and all..,Nice tour stop. They had the red carpet set out as there was a movie premier with all the glitterati set for the evening. The Oscars have been given out here for many years and everything is all about Oscars at this theatre. Tour guide really knowledgeable.,Chinapjs
40,Just walked the stairs,did not have time for the tour but we did walk up the stairs.Guess it is real Hollywood as they make this somewhat run down area look glamorous,parcapecod
40,"Nice Tour, interesting to know",We did this tour as part of LA Go Card. It was interesting tour with lot of nice fun facts about Oscar. Our tour guide was very good telling us every bit of it. Nice photo opportunities. Great to do if you get chance. Def better compared to Chinese Theatre,Atul C
40,If your in the area worth stopping.,"We used our Go Card for this tour. Check in at the box office then wait at the theater doors for the guide to let you in. This is a more of a history and gossip tour. You can take pictures with a Oscar and also on stage. I thought it was interesting, our guide had many stories of Oscar nights. If you drive be sure to have your parking validated for reduced rate, ask at the Box office where to get it done. Also pay at the machines before you leave the mall. The mall and the surrounding exterior streets is worth exploring.",jeep146
40,30 minute tour worth doing on Go Card,"We visited as part of the Go Card. You pick up your tickets downstairs for the tour which seemed to run each half hour.We had a great guide who took us on the short tour around the building with many interesting facts and features. The auditorium was being set up for America's Got Talent which was nice to see.In an area which is quite run down, the Dolby sits apart as a classy and sophisticated venue.",DJLGB
30,Dolby,Nothing special about the facade of his theatre. The stars to get to it gives it some elegance. We did nothing inside (the tour is expensive just to look around for a couple of minutes).,DrCDB
40,House of the Oscars,This theater might be the most prestigious one in the whole world simply because it hosts every year the OSCARS ceremony awards. It is located on Hollywood Boulevard next to TLC Chinese theater at the walk of fame. You may have a guided tour inside the theater which unfortunately we didn't have time to do. But at least we climbed the stairways several times where the stars walk to reach the theater as our hotel was right at the next door.,Osman B
50,Oscar goes to ...,One of the most exciting location in Hollywood even without Hollywood movie stars. Impressive building with exciting winners names along the stairway.,Adventure beyond imagination

40,ENJOYED OSCAR ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT AN OSCAR,"We were in Los Angeles and planned to see the Dolby Theatre. Since we stayed at Hollywood itself, it was our next door, otherwise, it is just besides Hollywood/Highland metro stop. We took online ticket at £19 each ,which started at 10:30 am. First we collected our prepaid ticket from the first floor ticket office and the trip started from 2nd floor. The guide was excellent and he first gave a briefing of Oscar history and procedures. We travelled from one area to the another and the guide explained an Oscar statuette with a TV demonstration, the Dolby Lounge, photos from previous Academy Awards.We had also seen the dressing room, the hall, the backstage area and press conference area after the award.Overall tour took about 30 mins and came out with a deep knowledge about Oscar procedures, formalities and became a proud visitor of the main theatre where the Oscar ceremony takes place.",DPMALLIC
50,Interesting tour,"We booked a tour and learned a lot about Dolby Theatre, the Oscars and other events that take place there. I'm not particularly a fan of the Oscars, but I really enjoyed my time. Our guide was super nice and we got to see the rehearsal of a famous TV show. We also got a free postcard at the end!It seems weird at first because it's a mall, but don't worry! Follow the path upstairs to the end of the hallway and you'll get there (after picking up your tour tickets downstairs).",Lunath
40,Entertaining tour,Did a tour of the Dolby Theatre and it was interesting. Being an outsider it gave a good perspective as to the size of the theatre and what happens particularly during the Oscars. The tour was enhanced by the delightful guide who made it more interesting,Adrian R
40,Good tour; perfect for a break from the crowds and heat,"I took the tour to get a break from the crowds and the heat! It was a nice respite. The tour guide was friendly and did a wonderful job. She is originally from CT and don't remember her name! I easily heard everything she said. It was not a rushed tour and went a little over, which I appreciated as I did not feel rushed as I love to take photos!",HyMaryland
40,Home of the Oscars,"I was surprised firstly that this is a modern building so there is not much history attached and secondly that it is actually in the middle of a shopping mall. It's worth seeing if you have the time, but not a prime attraction.",Betula103
40,Almost like getting an Oscar,Wanted to do this the last time we were in LA so wanted to definitely fit it in this time. Meet by a very nice guide who lead so I to the theatre. Got to see the VIP bar area used during the Oscars then back to the actual theatre where seats showed where the Stars had sat at the last oscars and then onto the stage to re rive our award. Lots of interested tidbits shared by the guide. This is a must do if you care about entertainment industry,Elfriede M
50,Awesome tour,"We went yesterday and the tour was great, extremely informative and casual. James our tour guide was awesome, he had all the answers and made the experience so much better. Good job James and Dolby crew...highly recommend it!!",Blake3754
40,"Neat, not a must-see","If you are a huge movie buff or Oscars fan, this theater is a must-see! When we visited, they were setting up for live shows of America’s Got Talent, so it didn’t look as glamorous as it does on TV for the Academy Awards. The theater was built in 2001, so there really isn’t a crazy amount of histrory or old stories— yet. Worth the visit if you like movies. Included on Go LA card. Tour guide, Kamen was nice and informative",Macawley B
50,Oscars BTS!,I would definitely recommend a visit here - guided tours last approx. half an hour and are very frequent. I was one of four in my group so we had the chance to stand on the stage. There were cardboard signs of the seating plan from the Oscars so that was quite humbling to see. Our tour guide was very friendly and super knowledgeable! (nb: I visited April '17),elisehenderson
30,Pretty decent.,It was cool to step foot where they give away the Oscars and learn a litltebit about the place. Our tour guide was pretty helpful and nice.,imrico

50,California holiday 2018,Well worth a visit. You get to see where the Oscars are held....CLOSE UP!! Our tour guide was brilliant!! I would 100% say go for this tour!!,Pete S
30,Not worth the trip,It takes over an hour and a half to go thru it most of the time is spent either waiting in a disney-type maze to get into a slide show and then you finally spend 10 to 20 minutes seeing a small amount of the King Tut finding. They were nice to see but not worth the time or the money.,paulbberg
40,Must See,"After watching the Oscars on tv, what a shock to find that it is actually in the middle of a Shopping Mall, which are all covered over for the big night itself! It is unbelievable the hard work that is put into a show of this magnitude, from everyone involved. Well worth a visit to here first hand from our guide.",Sandra F
50,What a COOOL place!!,This area is great to just explore and see everything the area has to offer. From interesting and fun stores to a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign!! Definitely want to go back!!,nfarst
40,Large and Impressive,"Fortunately I was there for an event along with over 3,000 other people, which is the best value for your dollar as far as seeing the Dolby Theatre. The seats were nothing special and I've seen nicer drink holder set ups in regular movie theatres, but what is nice is the expansiveness of the theatre in total. The sound and lighting quality was awesome. The stage definitely draws your attention. Best experienced when it is full and active.",CacheOn
40,Just to have seen it,"When you are in LA and surounding, you should obviously go there. We didn't buy an entrance ticket, but even the free accesible area is interesting.",romanshorner
50,Beautiful venue!,This theatre is beautiful and the sound quality is wonderful no matter where you sit. The stage is HUGE!,HCOverlord
50,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING ITEMS,We were visiting California when we saw that the King Tut exhibit was at the California Science Center so we purchased our tickets. It was well worth the cost. The exhibit had items that have never been out of Egypt and the descriptions made note of which items they were. Beautiful items so well preserved. If you are in the area and have a chance to see it ... go. There were many young kids there with their parents and it was so nice to see so many of them with a serious interest in the displays and how things were done ... it was a wonderful visit.,mburbank2016
30,A must see to experience the Oscars magic but woefully expensive without a pass,"The Dolby Theatre is world famous and hearing about how they change a shopping centre into the most glamorous night in Entertainment is a must see. You'll get to step inside and hear some great stories.However, what you will see is essentially the inside of a regular movie theatre. It is nothing special! Just a regular theatre and the tour will be over in 30 minutes.Be careful to check the website as sometimes it is closed days before events or has restricted access. When we went they were preparing for a lifetime award for George Clooney so we couldn't go on stage.Official price is $23 per adult which is really expensive. However, it is also part of the Go Los Angeles Card - this costs c$200 for 3 days although on Groupon it is sometimes cheaper. If you are going to go to Universal Studios and Warner Bros then the pass pays for itself and you get to see this essentially for free.",WorldTravellerfromGB
40,Interesting Items; Overpriced Admission,"Yes, the items are very interesting on the third floor part of the exhibit, but there aren't very many items and none of them are mind-blowing. Also, the first floor part of the exhibit is simply basic info about the discovery of King Tut's tomb, which you can read about elsewhere. This is not worth $30 plus $12 for parking. However, you can also see most of the other attractions while you're at the California Science Center, so that is a nice bonus.",Margaret R
50,Dolby theater tour,Great tour made better by Nouveau (sp) who had personality that enhanced the tour. If you watch the Oscars you will enjoy the tour. The back stage and on stage experience is worth the money. Better than the high pressure tours sold on Hollywood streets.,412Allen
30,Not worth the price,If you want to see inside you should buy a ticket and take a tour! I can say its not worth the price so just if you are so intrested in Oscar things or you want to do it once in the life time so go for it ! The video recording is not allowed there ! So you only can take pictures !,saaaraahss
50,Beautiful Theatre,The 30 minture tour of the Dolby Theatre is short but sweet. The theatre was stunning and was so cool to see backstage where all the Oscar stars go. We had a small group (5 people) so really got a great experience. Our tour guide was very knowledgable and friendly and although it is quite a pricey ticket it is well worth it for any film/theatre fans.,volcanicash28
50,Fascinating,I know this probably doesn’t happen often but my husband & I were the only ones that showed up for our tour at 3pm. Our guide was Nuvea (not sure how to spell that) she was super knowledgeable & really nice. We loved the tour & learning how they prep for the Oscar’s. We were able to see a lot of extra things since it was just us on the tour. Standing on the stage and visualizing how we see it on TV was interesting. I think it took about an hour. FYI-There is no public restroom during this tour. We are big fans of America’s Got Talent so seeing there changing room area was fun since on the show Howie is always running down the hallway pulling pranks.,redredles
50,The place where every movie fan would like to visit,"Dolby Theatre is known and as Kodak Theatre.What can I tell about the theater where the talents of the movie stars are rewarded with much desired small statue Oscar ?At the entrance is a long list with the award-winning movies along the time.Then we walk on the large staircase to the great hall of the theater.Here are a lot of small shops, and from a terrace you can see the emblem ""HOLLYWOOD"" on a hill of Los Angeles.",Gabriel A
40,Kodak theatre,This theater is also known as Kodak theatre. There are lot of shops in the building. You get to see Hollywood sign from one part of the building. There are two huge elephant structures opposite to the theatre. This is the theater where Oscars are held.,Ravindra V
20,Zzzzzzzzz : Boring,Go to The Chinese Theater and skip this one. Our tour guide was great and knew his stuff. There’s just nothing to see inside. It’s a new venue with no character and no memorabilia. Picture a conference center with a theater- and that’s the Dolby.The tour was about 20 minutes and about $15 a person. Not worth it.,GraniteSprite
50,Great event - great theatre - great night out,"We managed to get tickets to the Big Bang Theory session of the 2018 Paleyfest held at the Dolby Theatre while visiting from Australia. What a great night.Was thrilled to hear from and meet with the cast of the Big Bang at this iconic place. The night was alternately funny, educative and sometimes moving as the cast and creators spoke about their show and some of the effects it is having.I couldn't have enjoyed the event more and found the theatre to be comfortable although smaller than I had expected, being the venue for the Academy Awards.Very happy to have attended and would recommend to others",Michael L
50,Beautiful Theater,"We went to the Kelly & Ryan after-Oscars show at the Dolby on Monday, March 5, 2018. The Oscars set was still in place - just gorgeous. The theater itself is beautiful and the seats very comfortable.",MaryEhret
40,Cool to see,We had 1 day in LA. We parked at the Dolby Theatre and walked around Hollywood Blvd. We didn't do a tour but enjoyed seeing the red stairs. There is a great view of the Hollywood Sign from the balconies in the courtyard.,Karen C
30,Nice but short,We did the tour which we were told is 30 minutes long but ended only being not even 20 minutes cause he started 5 minutes late. Our tour guide was rude and wouldn't even give us time to take pictures. Felt like he didn't want to be there.Would have rated a 5 star if we didn't feel so rushed.,FP7020
50,A Piece of History,"What can I say about this place.... apart from it is incredible! We had a small group of 6 people which made the guide feel more comfortable. Our tour guide was brilliant, she knew so much about the theatre and it's history and able to answer all of our questions. She showed us around the theatre, and advised of what happens in each location and what she would usually do on the night of the event. The tour moved on to a bar where were able to see an Oscar behind glass which was a highlight of the tour. One of my favourite bits has to be the view from the stage to the theatre - We even got to see where the famous selfie was taken which was. The tour guide advised that the winners would be called up on to the stage and taken down a windowed corridor to another part of the building for press interviews. All in all I felt that this tour was worth the money and would highly recommend anyone to do this tour.",James E
50,Great!,"I enjoyed going on a tour of the theatre, to see where the Oscars are held! It's a beautiful theatre, and it's nice to see it in person.",DSpad
50,Great tour - fun and informative,The chance to see where the Oscars is hosted is amazing and it houses one of the real Oscars that has been donated to the theatre. Great couple of hours for movie fans.,Chris Goodall
50,Dolby Theatre Tour,"We are so glad we did this! We had a great tour guide who was full informative and polite, he showed us all around, provided lots of interesting information and let us take our time. We didn’t feel rushed at all and despite this being included on the Go Card I feel it is fairly priced if you were to pay. I would recommend to anyone visiting Hollywood.",Clare C
40,Great Theatrical Space; home the the Academy Awards,You can take a tour of the facility plus the theater is located in a shopping/restaurant area that is very popular with tourists. Lots of street artists on Hollywood Blvd. in front of the theater. There is parking underneath.,Thomas S
40,When in LA😀,All in the same vicinity as the TCL Chinese theatre and the walk of fame stars. Worth the visit inside. They have tours that run during the day.,inandouttravellers
40,Very Grand,Attended an event at the Dolby Theater. Clearly Oscar worthy with photographs of winners throughout. A grand staircase where one can feel the spirits of actors and actresses of the ages. Terrific acoustics and comfortable seating. Tours are available which we will check out next time. Definitely worth a visit.,MegtheHealer
50,Fantastic venue with opera house seating!!!,"We're on a budget so purchased mezzanine seats and they were great! Sat high but so close to the stage, view was fantastic! Iconic venue that is much smaller than on TV. Easy parking on Orange Ave., paid a flat fee of $15 which we thought was great in this area. Close to shopping & restaurants...in the heart of Hollywood. First visit for us...we will definitely be back!",Iwannago2
30,Visot,I guess when you are in Hollywood the Dolby theatre is a must. Was a rainy day so didn’t enjoy it to the full extend. Worth the visit.,HarryHarry123
50,Actually saw the entrance promenade and corridor where the celebrities stroll down while they,I Actually saw the main entrance corridor and promenade that the celebrities stroll 🚶 stroll down to the annual Academy Awards. It is clean and well maintained.,Dave L
10,Don't waste your money here,"Booked a tour of Dolby theater and was very excited for this. Unfortunately there were about 32-35 people on the tour (a huge group of Hindu tourists) so if you were not right behind your tour guide you heard nothing. What I saw on the tour was several hallways and staircases with dirty carpet (I guess they clean it once a year for the main event - Oscars), two bars and rows of chairs in the theater itself. They had an event that night so were preparing the stage for it and it was all darkened. I could only see the chairs in the theater. The tour guide was incredibly arrogant and rude that I was left speechless. He ignored the rest of the group that was upstairs and continue the tour without them downstairs. The Hindu group got lost and he only said: ""Whatever"" and continue without them! No time for answering questions - he had immediately after our group other group. Yep, LA is a place of money and Dolby Theater tour was profiting as well - tour after tour with guides, who did not give a dime for being there and sharing any info with tourists. Not worth of my or your money!",Lucie J
40,Shopping and More,"I had been through the shopping center and up the ""walk"" for the emmys a number of times, but I had never really noticed all of the movies by year listed for whom won awards along the wall as you walk up the famous stairs. But it does not stop there. As you head up to the higher floors, you have a very nice view of the Hollywood sign as you look through the gate from the catwalk or bridge where the elephants are. It is a nice view. There are different sayings from entertainers spread throughout the courtyard that made for an interesting read. A number of shops and restaurants are also connected to the theatre.While I had been here a couple of times previously, it was not until my food tour where I had a guide pointing out all of the History and detail from this place that I truly appreciated all that is has to over and the level of details.",runaway2travel
40,What trouble I had...,"I had my tour ticket clutched in my hand but some officious security people wouldnt let me in to the auditorium. They were setting up fora live America's Got Talent tv show and thought this senior citizen was some fan hanger-on. I was so furious. I missed out on the tour but got in to another tour when the problem was sorted out. I figure this tour must have been better because I saw the dress rehearsals for AGT. This was a marvellous way to see the beautiful theatre in all its glory, lit up, lasers and lights flashing, a guy singing on stage.. What a lovely magical-looking dome to the inside of the theatre. My guide was knowledgeable. I enjoyed the tour.",Pixiehat
40,Great Modern Theatre Hall,"This is modern theatre hall which holds many Oscars presentations. It has a very stage and audience hall. When we were there for the Guided Tour, we saw the Setup for America Got Talent. Impressive!",AlanChua33
50,Very happy that I visted this!,Worth going. We were lucky enough to see the rehearsals of America's got talent. The tour was really good and a must see if you are in LA,Anambitioustraveler
50,My afternoon at the Dolby,"I received a free ticket to watch Americas Got Talent at the Dolby Theatre.What a beautiful place. Clean, professional and wonderful ambience.I would love to go again.Thank you",MishaD004
40,Academy Awards,This is where the Oscars take place. The tour was short finished in just 30 minutes but was very informative. Always wondered what the Oscars venue looked like and was rather surprised to see that it was in a tiny mall.It does look extraordinarily spectacular on screen so was a bit disappointed.,Sachin_Zarekar
40,Impressive,"It is located in a shopping mall, so there is underground parking lot and it is not expensive. You can buy tickets to a guided tour and visit the actual theatre, walk where stars walk. Tours are approximately 20 mins length and you feel a little bit rushed. But, I think it is a must when you came to Holywood.",Berkin B
10,Terrible tour.,"I had such high hopes but they were dashed.This tour was awful. You're barely allowed to take any photos.On my particular day, we were not allowed anywhere near the stage. We were shown the outside of the winner's walk - but couldn't go on it. We were shown cardboard photos of the governors' ball - but not allowed anywhere near the venue.Oh, and you can take photos of an academy award in a case. (At Warner Bros. you can hold a real one and have your picture taken with it, all for free.)I agree with the recent review. ""A real scam""",Tim R
50,Awesome tour!,"This tour was super cool and my 15yo daughter loved it too. So interesting to see where the Oscars are held, where the red carpet lies, see an Oscar up close, sit in the theater, and see all the pictures and dedications to Oscar winners. As a bonus treat, when we were there they were rehearsing for Americas Got Talent and we got to sit in on it - so cool!",twinkies
40,Oscars,"Once you visit Los Angeles as a tourist, I think Hollywood, Dolby Theatre and the Stars are a compulsory stop.Nothing new, but just the environment worth a visit.You can park in the mall for just 4$ if you buy something in the mall. There is a balcony from which you can see the Hollywood sign.",PezFish
10,A real scam,"42 dollars to enter the 2nd floor of the theater and show the stage. Do not waste your hard earned money. If the tour had shown backstage, show how good the sound was , or basically anything it would be interesting. Spend your money elsewhere",Linoclemente
50,Interesting,It was a very good knowable guide and the time (30 minutes)just right! He was was very professional and knew his stuff!It gave a good knowledge about the Oscar price giving and how it influence the whole areaWe can really recommend this short trip!,LasseSpanien
40,"Lovely courtyard to relax, awesome to see tributes to all the best movies.","I didn't take the tour, but just walked around the complex. High end stores, and a lovely fudge shop! Look up the pillars in the foyer to see mentions of all te previous Academy awards best movies. The courtyard is nice to relax, with a coffee mid walk of fame. Easy to get to from the red line train station. Check out Sweets candy store in the back of the complex near the tourist Info centre.",Ronchelle B
50,Nice tour,"Was a bit hesitant to do this bc of some not great reviews, but did it any. Was glad I did. My husband and two teenagers went. We all liked the tour. Alex was a great tour guide: knowledgeable, energetic without being overwhelming, helpful (e.g. Picture taking), and funny. Interesting to see where the Oscars are held, walk their walk and see behind the scenes. AAA and other discounts",Jane D
20,Not what we expected,Not worth the $23 per person. The tour lasted less than 30 minutes. The most disappointing aspect was the tour giude who was very disintetested in what he was doing. Told us he's an actor who appeared in Modern Family. Made it obvious to us that giving tours around the Dolby Theater to mere tourists was beneath him and couldn't get us out of there quick enough. Sorry to burst your little bubble of self importance dude but if you can't act or fake your way through a simple theater tour...maybe your one tv appearance will be the one and only.,NorthStar510398
40,Quick look behind the scenes,"The tour itself is a mere 30 min and comes at a $23 price point. However, it will give fans of the Academy and opportunity to get close to an actual Oscar statue, see the backstage areas and get a glimpse of how it feels to stand on the actual stage but don't expect to get a comprehensive tour of the entire theatre.The downside was that our tour guide had done this tour too many times to be engaging or care.",Leeluu28
40,Enjoyed the tour,"I wasn't planning on taking the tour, but decided to do so and took the last tour of the day. It was $23 for 30 minutes which was fine. I enjoy the Oscars so I liked the tour. Tour guide didn't seem so into it, but it was the last tour of the day and he did answer questions. Just felt he rather be elsewhere.",michael r
50,Oscars!,This is where the Oscars are held. I was able to walk up the stairs and see all the best pictures listed. I never realized there was shops here and places to eat. It was a great experience and a lot of fun! You can also see the Hollywood sign from here!,Christina O
30,An ordinary theater for the outside,Dolby Theatre is an ordinary theater from the outside. The only time worth visiting this theater is when is the Oscar time.,AntoNic7
50,Backstage at the Oscars,Took a tour of the theatre which gives you a full tour of what happens on Oscar night.From the moment a star arrives and is shown into a vip waiting area onto where they take there seats and for the lucky few on to the stage to receive their Academy Award.Then backstage where interviews take place and then where the after party is held.Gives a great insight into what happens on the night.If you like movies then its a must see,Allan S
50,Very Nice,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dolby Theater tour. I was a short but very sweet tour. You go inside the theater take pictures. Tour guide explained everything very nicely. I did this tour after Rockin Hollywood tour, where I had a horrible experience.",worldtraveler2210
30,Not worth the hype...,"I went inside the theatre, it was beautiful but not a lot of people would find it fascinating and therefore you can avoid it if you want...",Kartik Sharma
50,A great experience,"We weren't planning on doing the tour of the Dolby theatre, we decided on the spot. Was worth every cent! A beautiful theatre, explained by a great guide who actually works there on Oscar nights. If you like watching the Academy Awards or want to improve your pop culture knowledge, this is a must! you will learn so much about what happens behind the TV screen.",Ade I
50,Something for everyone - Home to the Oscars,"This is not to be missed. Parking is available under the building with elevator and escalator access to the complex. There are many types of restaurants from family style to expensive ""white linen"" ristorantes for all appetites. The fountain at ground level is great for children to jump in and out of. Stores and kiosks for the tourists needs and desires. Great place for movie premieres!",JaniceG2
40,Academy awards,We didn't go inside the theatre but we walked around the outside. The past academy award winning movies dating back from 1940 are displayed as you walk up the stair case to the entrance of theatre.,Gloria M
30,Short,"I did not pay for the tour, as I was using a Go Card, but if I had paid, I would have felt very ripped off at the steep price. The tour was about 15 minutes, and basically saw the lobby really quickly, then saw an oscar in a case, then the balcony of the theater and done. Two opportunities to take pictures, and it was nice the guide would take pictures for you. The guide was polite and knowledgeable, but seemed a little snooty, like he felt the tour was beneath him. It was a little off putting, but I may have just read the situation wrong.",VacationerGuy

50,The Nutcraker,"I had never been to the Dolby Theater as it has been well over a decade since the last time I was in Hollywood. I must say - I was blown away. The Hollywood & Highland center is amazing on it's own, but the theater is simply superb. My girlfriend and I were attending the Nutcracker prior to Christmas and we both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Although we were seated on the second level in the center, there didn't appear to be a bad seat in the house. The acoustics and lighting are fantastic. I highly recommend attending a show at the Dolby Theater.",JamesA
30,Shen Yun,"My mom and I came here to see Shen Yun. I have no issue with the theater itself, it's the location that I hate. Parking at the Dolby Theater is a night mare. It took almost an hour to get out of the lot! There are no attendants to guide traffic, and I actually pushed the emergency call box because I needed help finding my car, but nobody responded and it kept getting a busy signal. Next time (if there is a next time, I will park at an off site lot).As far as the theater, it's small which gives it more of an intimate feel. It also means that most seats offer a good view of the stage. Sound system is pretty good.",Isunwin
40,Landmarks at hollywood broadwalk,This theatre and shopping center is famous for its lobby and splendid ladder with circle balcony. The outside connect to Hollywood mall with fantastic fountain plaza with chic restaurants and perfect spot for taking photos or even selfie.,jajavalB
30,Just OK,"Took the tour on Friday April 7th. It was just OK. Tour guide seemed bothered that he had to do the tour. Seemed like typical information given on tour, nothing super interesting. It was nice to stand on the stage and take the ""winners walk"".",damonw730
40,a great venue for a concert,The Dolby theatre is a great place to watch a concert. Despite the fact that that this theatre hosts the Oscars it is not nearly as big as you would expect - there are some of the downtown LA theatres that are bigger than this.The bars are far too expensive.,allanbowers
50,Amazing!,"It wasn't on my bucket list of places to visit in Hollywood, but it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Standing on the stage and looking out into the theater was amazing. A must see.",Travelnotes2017
20,"Close whenever they want, despite posted tour hours.","While I enjoyed the tour, be aware they they may close early.We arrived during tour business hours one day during March break, only to find out from the box office that they decided to close early that day. Thanks a lot. And they still had an hour before official closure time. Also, they was right after they were closed for about a month for the Academy Awards.",product-of-canada

40,Private tour,"Backstage tour of the Dolby Theatre where the Academy Awards (the Oscars) are held. We walked down the staircase, onstage and along the corridors, saw past winners' photos and a real Oscar. The Theatre is actually a lot smaller than it appears on television. Great experience, tour guide gave us a lot of anecdotes about Oscar nights and actors.",Gogirl12345
40,Fun to see the outside,We just walked around the outside of the Dolby Theatre to look at the winners of (I think Picture of the Year) that won each year. It's a beautiful building and home to many awards shows and events throughout the year.,VEE1225
40,We REALLY liked the Doby Theater Tour!!,"If you're taking a tour of LA - the Doby theater is a place that you will want to include. We (me, my husband and teenage son) took the tour of the home of the Academy Awards - much to my surprise - we each equally enjoyed it. Definitely worthwhile and it doesn't take a lot of time.",Michele Friedman
50,Short but good tour if you like Oscars,30 minute tour so short but was very informative. Loved seeing where the stars go and didn't realise that it was held in a mall! Recommended. Did as part of Go Los Angeles Card,23tiffanyk
30,Oscars venue,"Whilst we didn't have time to go in an see a film whilst we were visiting Hollywood Boulevard, it was great to stop along the way and see where all of the winners of the Academy Awards go to receive their Oscars each year.It's very busy so you have to wait a while if you want to get a picture without hoards of tourists in view.",Kevan W

50,See the interior of the Host location for the Oscars!,"While a bit price for a 30 minute tour ($22 + tax per person at the time of this writing), the tour is excellent as it takes you through the Dolby theater describing the Oscar venue and how it operates on Oscar night! You'll visit key areas of the theater and get to see where all the big stars are on Oscar night!Tours currently operate every 1/2 hour so you can drop in pretty much any time ... and you're done quick (but do see a lot!)If you're hooked on Hollywood and the stars it produces -- well worth the $22!",Cowhead4
40,Majestic,"Theatre is famous for hoisting Oscar awards. But it hoist other shows too. Location is perfect. The staircase, architectures are majestic. But needs time to explore the theatre.",Rabi_Sharma
50,Wow!,"Firstly the tour is only 30 mins so if you're looking for an in depth tour of every corner of the theatre you're going to be disappointed. The info in the box office and on the website clearly state the length of time and areas covered.Our guide, Julissa, was brilliant. Informative, helpful and delivered in a lively fashion with plenty of humour. The highlight has to be standing on the stage and looking out at the auditorium.It's well worth a visit but bear in mind the cost of $22 for 30mins. We were happy with that but it might not be to everyone's taste.",Fabmum66
40,DOLBY THEATRE,"This site is famous because all OSCAR award giving ceremonies are conducted over here only. The theatre is beautiful, with small seats. All Oscar winners names are placed on a vertical row with the year. it is amazing that such great winners have attended the ceremony over there. There is a mall attached and also parking slots below. The guide, gave the entire history with a monotonous tone and was boring. This place is a must for tourists, who come over to Los Angeles.",vaida17
40,Trevor Noah,We saw Trevor Noah here and it was an amazing show. The theater is really cool. There are lots of pictures from old Academy Awards ceremonies. The theater itself is beautiful. The seat were kind of small but not uncomfortably so. We sat up on the mezzanine but still had a pretty good view. There is a bar on each level of the theater that offers alcohol and snacks. The theater can be accessed from the mall that is attached.,trishakelley
40,Morning tour,"Decided to take the tour with friends. Got to the box office just after it opened at 1000. This was thanksgiving weekend so it was pretty busy. It's an interesting venue, being the home of the Oscar ceremonies. However it lost a little as our guide, whilst a nice enough bloke, was obviously bored and the delivery of his commentary was lacklustre. Loses a star for this.",Paleflier
50,Inside the Oscar,"This is a tour of the place the Oscars are awarded. See behind the scenes of the show you watch every year, Learn about the elevator to the press room, the two large rooms for celebrities to relax and have drinks in after winning. Then there is the hotel next door where many of them get ready and the winners party. Not too expensive for LA but well worth the cost. Tour guide was interesting and informative",haroldrooke
50,Amazing,"Stumbled across the tour of Dolby theatre whilst taking pictures of the staircase leading up to it!Tour was fantastic, just getting to stand on the stage where the oscars are handed out is truly an amazing experience!

50,A Must See tour for any Movie Fan!,"We took a half hour tour 'behind the scenes' at the Dolby Theatre, home to the Oscars. The small group tour explained where the attendees come in from the red carpet on Oscar night and explains how the whole building was designed for stars to see and ;be seen'.A replica Oscar was on hand but only behind a glass case, so my Oscar winning photo will have to wait for another year!The guide worked at the Theatre and took us through the Oscar night process, the bar they drink at before taking their seats, the corridors where the 'seat fillers' wait and onto the stage. The Oscars stage!This stage was vast, looking out to the mauve coloured seats and boxes of the auditorium. We got time to take photos ourselves on the Oscar stage before being taken round the Oscar winners walk (from the stage to the interviews and back to their seats.)We got to sit in a box and see the view from up high.The theatre had plenty of iconic photography of previous winners throughout the decades.This was a fantastic tour, short but insightful.Travel Tips:1. You can only book tickets on the day of your tour so plan ahead. As they run every half an hour you shouldn't have to wait long but make sure you plan something else to do whilst waiting. There are plenty of stores and the walk of fame outside, so you won't be bored!2. Tickets are booked on the ground floor box office. The tour starts on the first floor. You should wait outside the Dolby Theatre entrance (where everyone is taking pictures.) It will look deserted until a minute before your tour when someone will show up and let you in.3. Ticket bookings with a credit/debit card will need photographic ID.4. There is no restroom access during the tour. There are free restrooms on the first floor outside the Dolby so plan ahead.",WineTravelandSong
40,Good experience but a bit pricey,"It is the Dolby Theatre so every movie fan should be thrilled. However, I am a little bit disappointed. The tour was too short (about 25 minutes), too ordinary and too expensive. We saw nothing unique (except the auditorium). The lights were turned off causing the main attraction to be poorly visible. We did not hear anything special as well. I give four points because it was personal experience for me. Otherwise, I would give no more than three points. There is one plus - no lines!",Acidov
30,disappointed,"Paid $40 for 20 minute tour . Went to main theatre for 2 minute talk . Can't take photos , not worth it .",Ganagana358
50,Well-designed theatre for watching live performers,"I've seen both a live comedian and a Cirque du Soleil show at the Dolby Theatre and it was an excellent venue for both. All the seats have excellent views of the stage and the acoustics are great.

I took the 12:30 pm tour and it started right on time. We went backstage to see how the action unfolds, walked the red carpet that starts walk, saw the champaign they drink, saw some great Oscar ceremony photos, and saw the theatre from the inside at various angles and even the royal boxes.

You will find lots of shopping and restaurants, as well as, the walk of fame and the famous Hollywood sign. You have to pay to park but its worth it. There will be people trying to stop you and sell you things off the street but just ignore them.",kdoug19
10,Terrible Tour,"Went on a tour of the Dolby Theater. Do yourself a favor and save the $22 per person. Tour was 30 minutes, Tour Guide could not hide his boredom or disdain for us tourists. We basically walked through the Lobby, went into the balcony of the theater, and saw an Oscar behind glass. Our tour guide was not the least bit interested in the tour or us, and the whole thing was a waste of time and money.",JAT109
50,Interesting and beautiful,"I've never watched the oscars but will be making sure I do after this informative and inspiring tour. Our tour guide was so friendly and knowledgeable, plus she answered all our questions with both professionalism and a personal touch which really made us feel part of this beautiful theatre. Looking forward to tuning in next Feb now! Would definitely recommend this tour.",AmeMaere
30,Ticking the boxes.....,"We are doing a road trip from Las Vegas to Las Vegas via Grand Canyon,Phoenix,San Diego,LA and Palm Springs so we are almost at the point of doing as the title says.........ticking boxes of things we have seen.The theatre is ok........won't blow your mind but while your there you take it in!",John E
40,The Oscars,"The annual Academy awards take place here and will do so for many more years, you look at it and think, its smaller than it appears on TV and they sure do some set-enhancing when presenting the Oscars. The building is simple, smart and clean, worth 10 mins wander through and around but that’s it.",TeamWard
50,Not what it looks like on TV!,"We where on a tour of LA, this was one of our stops. It looks totally different on TV. It was interesting seeing the inside the way it really is. Has a list of all the Best Movie winners.",Michelle C
50,AGT Taping,BEAUTFUL venue! Took my girls to a live taping of America's Got Talent and was a wonderful experience. On-Camera-Audiences did a superb job of crowd control and getting us in in a timely fashion. Dolby Theatre is in a beautiful mall location and very easily accessed.,jujuscorner
40,Great Tour on a Hot Day,This was part of our LA Go Card options. It was nice to go back stage and see how everything is run. The tour guide gave us a history of the preparation that goes into putting on the show and it was great to walk through the areas where the celebrities hang out and party. It was a nice tour but not sure I would have spent the money separately if it wasn't part of the LA Go Card options.,JeanieB0915
50,Impressive venue,"Fun and interesting...at $22 a little pricey, but everything in LA is expensive and you learn to deal with it. All in all, glad we went...it is a fairly quick tour.",BBCard1
50,Guided tour of Oscars,"For $22 for 30 mins the tour is not cheap, but the inside knowledge is cool! Get to see the VIP areas, sit in the theatre and other areas not accessible to the public. Worth a visit and I got tickets just 10 mins beforehand from the Dolby box office.",Sarah W
50,Oscars tour,I would recommend this tour it was only $20 you could buy your tickets and come back it was only about 30 mins your taken backstage to where the celebs get there makeup done before they go on stage to host an award then your taken on stage looking at the audience we were sitting in the seat Leonardo di caprio sat this year and then taken where the winner goes after they win for photos and interviews well worth a visit,Colette242
50,Backstage Tour Worth It,"Wife convinced me to take tour as part of our LA Go Pass. Actually turned out to be one of my favorite stops. Guide was very thorough and discussed Oscar Awards history, setting up the theater and entry for ceremonies, etc. Got to walk onstage. Really cool to be standing in spot of presenters and see the vast size of stage and seating area.",Mark C
30,"Nice experience, not worth the money!","It is a nice experience to visit the Dolby Theater where they host the Oscars. But with that being said.. in hindsight I should not have bought the tour. The tour takes literally 30 minutes and you are outside again. Most of the areas you are not allowed to take pictures. The information given is nothing really new, so except for the fact that you actually been to the Dolby theater there is nothing to it.",Ben_1985_02
40,For Movie Lovers,"If you're into movies, you'll like the Dolby Theatre. It's connected to the Hollywood and Highland Mall, so you can shop, and have lunch while you visit. The famous grand staircase is fun to take a picture at, but in the summer it usually has a lot of people going up and down, so you have to be patient when you want to snap a picture. Sometimes you can luck out and there's no one on it. Around the staircase are listed all of the Oscar winning movies of the year, and you can tour the theatre (although I've never done it so can't comment on it). It's just down the block from the Chinese Theatre and across the street from El Capitan, so everything is right there on the same block. Park in the underground ramp which is very easy to access.",cynsha
10,Kind of a bust,"This place is hyped up so much because of the Oscars, but other than seeing the actual theater and some of the areas where the stars appear on awards night, it is really a letdown. Our tour lasted all of 20 minutes! They don't let you take pictures in stupid places like the hallway to the afterparty or photos of the venue setup over the years, but you are actually able to take photos of the stage and lighting areas and pose in front of an Oscar replica in a display case. Our tour guide acted like he really wanted to be anywhere else than with a bunch of tourists.There is really nothing remarkable about the building itself. In actuality, the staircase outside the theatre leading up from the street is a whole lot more impressive. Skip this one if you really don't have the time.",John S
50,If you love the oscars,"We did the tour of the theatre which is only around 30 minutes, but if you like the Oscars a nice little insight into the venue.Considering the oscars are going to be held there for the foreseeable future any fan should do it.Just over $20 , a nice thing to do to get away from the hustle and bustle outside.",markthecab
50,Glitz and glam of the oscars home,We did the inside tour and was not disappointed . The guide was very informative and kept you captivated in what the oscars experience is like . An amazing theatre . Went inside and sore the in progress Americas got talent set up . Do t miss it,Mark R
50,Beautiful Theatre,"We took a tour and it was amazing to see inside including backstage, on the stage and in the theatre. You get to walk the same walk that every oscar winner has done since 2001 after they win their prize. It's worth paying that much for it although it's not for long.It lasts for about half an hour and you get time to take photos.You can see where a few celebriies were sat during the last oscars.",Lightwing12Star
50,Academy Awards venue,"We entered Dolby Theatre keeping in mind the glitz and glamour of the Academy Awards ceremony. The place looks so different without it! What I found most impressive is the record of the best pictures award winners put up in pillars at either side of the staircase leading up to the theatre, having lots of slots for future winners too. Walking out to the compound full of shops, we could see the HOLLYWOOD sign in the distant hills.",AAB484
40,Impressive...,"It's massive,it's impressive and has a slice of movie history for the Oscar buffs...I would recommend that you take a tour inside. It's not very expensive, but will be really informative if you are a true blue Oscar fan.Must do attraction on the Hollywood boulevard.",BhawaniPathania
40,Inside Tour,We took a tour inside the theater. It was neat to sit in the same seats used at the Academy Awards. The tour lasted about 30 minutes and the guide was interesting. I never realized the theater was INSIDE a shopping mall!,Jan S
50,Dolby Theater is amazing!,This place seems like so much more than a theater. It is huge and has such elegant atmosphere! Very plush and comfortable.,Sandy252014
40,A must see if you are in L.A.,"This is the top most attrection to see if you are in L.A. Located in the best happening area full of tourist all the time. Specialy evening time is the best to visit this place. So many shops, Hard Rock cafe, 5 dollors stores, so much fashion on the street. Love this place..Vinod TandonDlhi",delhiwalaNewDelhi
40,Worth the Visit,"It is great to walk around the theater. That is where most of the major award shows are hosted. You can see quite a bit without paying. I believe there are tours of the inside if you like. If you have time and the price is right, go for it. It is just cool to be in such as monumental place.",AlexWorldTour
50,Love the Oscars? Go on the tour!,"We bought a 2 day Go Card and this was included! Loved the tour! You go into the host's dressing room, go in box seats and on stage! The theater is very different when not decorated for the show, so it is interesting to see how nice they make it for the stars!",Jane D
50,Pretty interesting Tour,What they don't want you to know about the oscars? - Yeah thats right: We have been told. I am telling you: The Oscars are hosted in just a regular MALL. That's why its redish and every shop in there has to Close for about 5 days bevor and during the ceremony... Still during the tour you'll see an Oscar which is pretty impressive.,AnnoBerna
40,Best thing on the street,"How good could this be in such a tacky town. Very good. We had a great guide who actually is part of the organisational team for the big event, so has some relevant background info. Great architecture, small sample of red carpet, sweeping stairs. The theatre is great, the stage is immense, the orchestra pit small. The corridors are full of photographs of Oscar winners. An Oscar is on show. A great tour.",Mikethenailer
40,Viva las vegas,As part of our American roadtrip we visited LA. We took opportunity to stop here. Parking in the complex was easy and not badly priced. The actual cinema well it is what it is a few sparkling steps upto it inside the foyer but that's it. Blink you walk past it apart from the tourists being photographed on it.,MarcandLauraB
50,The life of a star,Our guide for the tour was full of knowledge and experience...he works all of the events at the dolby theatre. Learned a lot about the Oscars and how they prepare for such as big event. great tour overall. Well worth the price of admission.,Loren B
20,Dolby,"As a tourist, I find it ok only. Guess the real deal is when you can get celebrities there. Go only if you have time for some pictures.",Alencia
40,Worth a visit if you love the Oscars,"Good tour of the theatre where you can experience what it is like to be on the Oscars. You get to go on the stage, balcony and behind the scenes. Anyone who watches the Oscars every year should go on this tour.",John S
40,"Crowded, but a must see for visitors","Well, it is definitely a must see if you are visiting Hollywood. The walk of fame, Chinese theater, lots of stores and places to eat. The Kimmel show across the street. There is plenty of garage parking and only $2 with validation for 2 hrs. It is very crowded with lots of annoying foreign tourists, but still worth the visit.",Michael Y
40,Great tour,Great opportunity to see the backstage of the oscars. Learn about the history and about the present of the theatre and the oscars,GeorgeMoshDub
40,Cool,It was inside a mall if you dont want to pay extra 15 bucks just follow the tours. Thr stairs is directly across jimmy kimmel stage that is where the red carpet walks happen,vlad0930
50,Fantastic. Worth every penny.,"I feel terrible for forgetting our tour guide's name (he showed us Tuesday 10th May 3.30pm), but he was a delight. His knowledge was vast and his passion for his work was admirable.I saw a lot of people going in to the tour entrance during the day, but the time we went we were the only ones that were on it, but they did the tour for us anyway, which was awesome as they could have easily asked us to wait to join a bigger group. In fact, just the two of us going was amazing. We felt like VIPs! We could ask so many questions and our guide kindly took photos of us in the theatre. We learnt so much and it felt like quite an honour to be there. We left the tour absolutely buzzing. Would definitely do it again. 30 minutes doesn't sound long, but I think it was just the right amount of time to see everything and fully appreciate the experience. Any longer would take away the magic of it.",GemmaNewbery
30,Interesting tour but too short...an easy money maker,"We paid to go on the tour of the Dolby Theatre, to get a behind the scenes look at the venue where the Academy Awards Ceremony happens. The tour was somewhat informative, but the guide wasn't the friendliest and it didn't last nearly long enough. Obviously, it's not going to take half a day to get around it all...but for what we paid the tour felt rushed, which was disappointing.",AbbyOlivia
40,Good to see where Oscars happen,The theatre was interesting as was the commentary during the tour. Not as much novelty as the old Graumann's theatre. Worth the 45 minutes it takes for the tour.,AntarcticBound
50,Surprisingly Good!,"My 13-year-old son and I were poking around until our hotel room was ready. We drifted by the tour sign at the theater and thought, ""what the heck?"" The tour (though expensive for 45 minutes) was excellent. We are so glad we did it! Turned out to be a highlight of the trip for us. The pace was just right. Not too much history, but enough to give you some perspective. What fun to see the behind the scenes AND get to go on stage. Definitely recommend it!",kwb327
50,Oscar Fans!,"This theater is worth the look. The tour was professionally conducted, telling us the history behind the theater and all the gossip and tidbits about the stars. The tour also explains how the Oscar Awards are conducted, and how everyone are seated. It was a fun tour.",anitha g
40,History and present usage are worth a listen,"We used our LA GO card to attend this walk around the theatre and learn about the gala events, the Oscars is one of them, that it is used for. You will get a real look behind , in and around how the events are handled. it will take around 45 minutes to see everything and it goes quick.",tctommy
50,Enjoyed it more than we thought we would,"This was a short tour, but we really enjoyed it. They were setting up for the American Idol finale so we got to see that. They walk you down the ""winners walk"" and tell you a lot of the behind the scenes things that take place on Oscar night. There were only 5 of us on the tour so we were able to ask a lot of questions and felt like the tour was really tailored to our interests. For some people it probably wouldn't be really exciting, but our family loves the moves and the Oscars are something we all watch together every year, so for us it was a worthwhile tour.",deltaduck2
40,Home of the Oscars,"The Dolby Theatre is the home of the Oscars. The outside is grand, and the foyer is littered with nods to previous winner, including panels with the names of every Best Movie winner. A good stop.",Ice_D_8
40,Nice venue,A large Theater that actually seems quite intimate. It looked like all the seats had good sight lines with good legroom and comfy cushions. Parking is in the complex and convenient.,UltimateWines
40,Well worth the admission. A definite must do.,"I took the dolby tour on the spur of the moment, following a morning doing the paramount VIP tour. it is only $20, and takes half an hour. It is definitely worth stopping by.You get to look around the theatre, and hear stories about the oscars and learn how it all works, seat fillers, steps, service lifts, decorations, designed for tv, everything. There are opportunities to take photos, and no one tries to sell you anything.Really interesting. recommended.",esky1
40,Surprising Blase,"My husband was determined to see where the Academy Awards are held each year and since we were right there we paid the $ and took the tour. And it was no big deal. It's actually hard to imagine all those movie stars in their elaborate gowns sitting in those theatre seats...they aren't as nice as the ones in a regular movie theatre! Those of us on the tour were shocked at the ratty condition of the carpet...it's amazing how things look in person as opposed to television. Our guide shared a couple of interesting tidbits, such as the fact that there are seat fillers who stand in the hall and really do take the empty seat of anyone who gets up and leaves during the show (think Kramer in ""Seinfeld""). And that the bar used to be open all night but the attendees ended up staying there and watching the monitors from the bar so they changed it, but then changed it back. Other than that, though, there really was nothing to see but an empty theatre.",Sassy6724
50,Beatiful theater with excellent views,"Although we sat a long way from the stage in one of the top balcony/mezzanine (that is the downside of the cheapest tickets for an event) our views were clear and unemcumbered. The sound was not crisp for some parts of the event, but I believe it was the sound mixers of the event rather than the theater's speakers (but I may be wrong). The theater is enclosed in a large shopping complex and it requires some time to get from street level or the underground parking lot to the theater entrance and then from the entrance to upper level seats.",Lorne29
50,Lovely place to visit,Spend 5 nights in LA with my family from Sydney. We spent time at the Dolby theatre on two separate occasions (for dinner and coffee). It was a lovely and relaxed environment. Unfortunately there were no shows playing at the time which would've been lovely but it was still worth a visit.,Samarrr
50,The Hollywood heart,The marble staircase embellished with shiny fragments of color gives to those who experience the feeling of living a moment of fame.They can hear the notes of the melody of success.,Marianna B
40,Nice Tour,"As other reviewers have said, the actual theatre is rather unimpressive. HOWEVER, the main lobby as well as the backstage spaces are very cool and interesting. Also, our tour guide was very knowledgeable, and was able to tell us many interesting anecdotes about the theatre and the oscars in general",Yaacov D
50,Don't skip the inside tour.,"A great tour for a rainy day, and it did pour that day. Loved all the pictures and info on the Academy awards, but the Dolby Theatre is it's own star.",Susan K
40,It's a part of the mall!,"Never knew that the famous Dolby theatre is an extension of the mall next door. A very downbeat place which turns exotic during the Oscar ceremonies.The place is average, even the theatre is not impressive and seats look run down. I am not sure if they redo it every year before the big ceremonies. The central galley and the famous stairs(which are the exit to the mall) where the photo shoot usually takes place are impressive though.",Diwyesh
30,cute little tour,"If you want to know a bit about the theater where the oscar ceremony is held, you have your chance by taking a short 45 minute tour. You get a sneak into the rooms behind the stage as well of the stage itself. The theater itself is not really spectacular though - so the location itself and it's (short) history is what counts.",Matthias W
30,Disappointing,The theatre tour was disappointing. I was expecting an elegant theatre but found a dingy old theatre with very worn seats and carpet in the middle of a mall. I did learn some things but I found the tour guide arrogant. The web page for the tour said we were supposed to see the Oscar statuette and the Dolby lounge. We didn't see either.,Kathy R
20,Disappointed,We took the guided tour and we're greatly disappointed. It's essentially a regular theater until the week of the Oscar's. I was not impressed.,Fain R
50,"Short, but informative tour","Having watched the Academy Awards telecast for years, it was very informative to learn the behind the scenes activities, the Red Carpet location and setup, walk the same areas as the stars, and stand on the actual presentation stage of the premier movie awards event. For example, the Oscar winners immediately leave the stage with their award and have to sign a contract preventing them from selling the Oscar statue for profit. This tour sheds a new light on watching the annual telecast in the future.",noraden
40,Cool place to visit (look out for the Hollywood sign nearby),"The Dolby theatre tour is nice but not too fancy. The tour guide was good and the theatre itself is actually quite big. This is something that you have to see at least once. The $20 price tag may be a little steep for just a tour but our GO Los Angeles card covered it for us. Also if you're not sure where to get the tickets, do go down to the ticketing booth on the ground level and not the theatre entrance at level 2. It can be hard to find. And yes, it can be confusing to have a the dolby theatre right in a mall. Also don't forget about the Hollywood sign near the mall.",jiachaol
40,Oscar transformed,walk the steps of all the fmaous people who make it to the annual oscars in the dolby. It is fairly transformed for the night although it is possible to get some shots with the elephants on the pillars!The shopping centre is fantastic with lovely reasonably priced restaurants in it.,DianeMayo
30,Interesting but abbreviated,"The tour is interesting but although the website says you will see an Oscar Statuette and visit the Dolby Lounge, the Lounge is currently closed for refurbishment until Feb. 2016 and you do not get to see the Oscar statuette either (they said because the lounge is closed).",cherylann17
40,Interesting piece of history,You go there to experience it and be a part of the history - just do it for the fabled bit.Don't miss the stairs pictures and the massive foyer - which attracts lots of selfie peole.,AMITSPVERMA
40,Nice,I think the tour is kind of pricey since it is only 30-min.But since we had GO LA cards I think it was worth it.Very interesting to see and hear about fun facts. They are open for visitors' questions all the time.No need to say how beautiful it is!,AnaCAlmeida1
40,Interesting,It was nice to see where the movie stars are when they receive Oscars.The tour only takes about 30 minutes but we found it interesting.,Sally155017
50,A touch of fame,"The old Kodak Theatre as I remembered it last is a must see whilst in Los Angeles. Pay to take the tour, it is really worth it. You get taken inside and taken up onto the dress circle. They are pretty strict on photography however you can take photos inside the theatre and the VIP area where there is an Oscar on display.The tour takes only 20-30 minutes and the guides can answer many questions.",SandyWR
40,Oscar venue ...... Good place to catch a show,"We caught Josh Groban here in concert and had a good time. We were in the balcony but had a good view of the stage. The acoustics were fine. The staff were not exactly the most friendly and they were practically screaming at the patrons to get out after the show ended. The complex itself is very interesting because it features pictures of movie stars and past awards cermonies. I gather that they have a tour of the complex but that of course is for the tourists. All in all, no complaints and a perfectly satisfactory place to catch a musical or other show.",vincemc
40,Movie Buffs,The tour of the Dolby theatre was cheap and quite informative and interesting. The tour guide was informative and the tour didn't drag on too long either. It is a must do for any movie buff visiting LA,Blake Kelly
40,See the Silver Screen and get the lowdown on the Oscars.,"The tour was 29 USD and 30 minutes long, enough time to walk the Oscar hopefuls walk.Our guide James was knowledgeable and took us along the same path that all of our favorite stars take on the big night. We found out how the silver screen got its name, how the awards are run, and got to sit in the seats of the Dolby Theater. You also see an Oscar. It is not a big tour so ideal for filling in time before a flight.The website gives you opening times, but on the day I went there was a private tour and had to wait 30 minutes. No big deal as the tours run throughout the day.I am not sure of the maximum numbers allowed but our group of around ten people was about right.",William S
40,Cool tour,This was a cool tour. It was nice to have a walk threw on how the Oscar's are set up And run . I would defiantly recommend this tour,Jahmai
50,Magnificent and iconic theater,"I've been to this theater many times, specially for the taping of America's Got Talent. Superb drinks at the bar make this theater a cool place to enjoy all its many attractions. The tour is a great value specially if you are from visiting from out of town. The surroundings are very hip, with a feeling of the Hollywood glitz and glamour.",trekkerFrank
40,Must see,"Right in the middle of the Hollywood jungle, the Dolby theatre is a nice stop if there is no event. We went there on a Tuesday mornig. The guide knew about Oscar and different subject relating to ther Academy. It’s a 20 minute tour. We’ve had access to the theatre in preparation of the Latino Award. Wonderfull site. Cool to see the stage with the technicians. Free with GO L.A. Card.",Jerry L
50,Great Tour!,We took this tour and it was really great! Our guide walked us through the whole venue while explaining how the prepare for the Oscars and other events around the year. Very interesting tour without falling into unprofessional 'dirt' on celebrities.,Angelica M
50,A must see!,"It is definitely a must see in Hollywood. I took the tour inside the theater as well and it was worth it. It cost 20 bucks for a 30 min tour, but it is really interesting. You can not only see the theater itself but also the Oscar statue, the lounges and so on. Our guide was very fun and knowledgeable.",Francyfre
50,Cool,"Beautiful place. You see columns there with successful movies marked on it. If walking correctly, you end in Hollywood and Highland Centre.",MonikaM94
50,great party venue,went to a big time hollywood event and enjoyed myself. Great location a few too many shops etc around it but a great experience in general.,vgreene
50,Do the tour...,"We did the Dolby theatre tour, we booked at the box office about five minutes before the start of the tour and it cost just $19 which I thought was a bargain!The tour guide was really informative and answered any questions we had.. My favourite part was going onto the actual stage where the oscars are held... AMAZING once in a lifetime experience!",simone j
50,A must see,Great tour! Beautiful theater with lots of history. We learned a lot about the Oscars and the preparation that goes one for this one night event. Our guide was awesome too! Very informative!,David P
50,Bocelli at the Dolby,"Great theatre! We saw Andrea Bocelli in concert. The theatre is very large and very famous. We were in Mezzanine 2. If you purchase tickets in this section, make sure you are place in the first row, behind their stage lights equipment.",salstar77
40,Reminds you of the Vegas strip,"The downtown walk is fun with walking down to the theatres, The Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre etc.It's a fun lively ambience, and is somewhat like walking on the Vegas strip, though Vegas is much more lively and fun.",AGeeKay
30,Nice theater,"The Theater: Beautiful & classy theater. That is where they do the Oscar. Huge theater, lots of seating. Unfortunately, no big screen TV in the theater, therefore, if you are sitting at the mezzanine, you might have hard time seeing the performers on the stage.Total 5 floors in the theater and yes they do have elevators. There are bars at every level, however, they do need more bartenders because almost every floor has long line waiting. Unfortunately, they can't handle all the people during intermission.The Service: All the staffs are very friendly & professional.The Parking: Hollywood & Highland parking structure. Unfortunately, the theater doesn't validate the parking. However, if you dine at any of the restaurants, they can validate the parking for you. Or I just go to Starbucks and get a coffee, they are more than happy to validate the parking too.",ILoveFoodComa
40,Simply Amazing!,"The view of Dolby is awesome when you pass by on the Walk of Fame. If you are a kid like me who grown up watching Dolby movies, it will be a dream come true if you see this logo live in front of you on this building. Simply awesome. Will go there this December again to live my dreams :)",Varun B
50,Amazing Experience!,"The Dolby theatre on Hollywood Blvd Los Angeles is an excellent place to visit to get a glimpse of the place where the world famous Oscar ceremony takes place every year. The price for the entrance is reasonable which is $20/person. you can get the ticket on Level 1 of the theatre. The total tour duration is 30mins long. The guide was so cool and explains everything in detail. On the tour he takes you to the dressing room, lobby, main theater and the seating area and most importantly you get to view the Oscar from very close. you can take pictures while on the tour. I highly recommend this place to people who visit Los Angeles",Veera P
50,Dolby Theatre,"The Dolby Theatre is like a milestone for Hollywood. For the local tourists its conveniently located near the Hollywood/highland LA Metro station, the theatre regularly holds cultural programmes. One can also take an interesting guided tour which will take you inside the theatre and one gets to know interesting Oscar trivia. The cost of the tour is $20 per person and available on all 7 days.",snehasaha9
40,Interesting Tour,"We took the guided tour of the Dolby Theatre and it was neat to spend time inside the empty theatre and see where various Oscar nominees and winners have sat during the Academy Awards show. For some reason, the guide seemed to have given us an abbreviated tour because we did not get to hold the Oscar statuette nor visit the dressing rooms. Maybe it was because filming was in progress for a show. Anyway, I thought the admission price of $19 was a bit steep for a 60 minute tour, but it's worthwhile if you're a big fan of movies and watch the Oscars show every year.",SgtBuffy
30,Good to see,Went here today and while it was neat to see it wasn't spectacular as I would have thought it would be. Just good to kick it off your bucket list.,jordansbulls
30,Don't Get The Hype,"Not sure what all of the hype is about for this place. Yes, it's where the Oscars take place, but really it's just a building when you get there. And a busy one at that!",Amy B
20,just to say you have been,"Like the walk of fame, only go if you want to tick it off your bucket list.Not much to see, hard to get to, too many people",Mimi-oz

50,USA Tour,Its a dream come true for me as it provided me a glimpse of the glittery world. Right from the place where the stars step on the red carpet up until the theatre where the ceremony is held is a mesmerising place. I just imagined the entire oscar ceremony which i followed through all the years & standing in that place experincing it is magical in every sense. As you walk down the stairs the walls have displayed the name of the movie which achieved the oscars for that year right from the first oscar movie until now. Its a must visit place for every body.,Sneha J
50,Mesmerised!,I had to pinch myself several times to remind myself that I was standing in front of one the most famous venues in the world. This is a much-go place for people who visit Los Angeles!,Tashan C
50,Hollywood at its best,We took a tour of the theater and it was great.About 1 and a half hr.Our tour guide Andy was very Informative. We saw the waiting room for the stars before they get their awards. We saw their dressing rooms and backstage.We learned how they prepare for that special day. And we saw an Oscar.,victoria a
50,Amazing!,"This tour is definitely for the movie lovers out there. when I was in the mall I didnt realise that that was the place where they held the oscars. I saw a poster on the wall and went to the kiosk to ask, when the woman told me I was reaslly excited to see it. the ticket was really cheap and the tour was great! The tour guide was really knowledgable and friendly. It was so surreal getting to stand on the stage and see the place in real life. It is a lot smaller than you would expect, the place looks huge on TV. the only thing that bothered me was that we couldnt go down to the seats to sit where the celebrities sit. other than that it was an amazing experience for movie lovers.",Ste M
50,A Hollywood Must See,"Beautiful place and filled with star power. The 30 minute tour is well worth the $19 ticket price. Lots of interesting information and exciting to step on the Academy Awards stage. Great shops located within the complex (and a great coffee shop at the bottom of the ""Oscar stairs"").",jamid215
40,Great History of the Oscars,"It was so interesting to hear about the start and history of the Oscars. We even got to see one up close! Not only do you see the theater with audience seats and the stage where celebrities gather in hopes of receiving an Oscar, you also get to see where the stars go to lounge behind the scenes. The Dolby Theatre tour was in such a convenient location, lasted about an hour, and was not overpriced. I think it was around 12.00 per person.",leah w
40,Not what I Expected,"I was surprised at how small this place was...I had not known that it had changed hands and they had made changes. I did get to see the hand and footprints of many stars. Inside the building there were many restaurants and a few shops. It was interesting but if you see it once, once is enough.",Patti M

40,Go behind the scenes of the Oscars!,"My husband and I went on this tour with our daughters (11 and 9) this summer. The tour was included in our Go Los Angeles cards. It was a very short tour, but just enough to learn about the Academy Awards that take place in the theater.I'm still in awe about how big the television screen makes the theater look when in reality the theater is small, with about 3000 seats. It always seems like the winning actors have such a walk up on stage, when there's about 8 feet between the stage and the first row of seats.My kids were impressed with the theater as well. They found it interesting how the theater looks before it is dressed up for the awards ceremony.I'd recommend the tour to people visiting Los Angeles. If anything, it's a nice short respite from the crowds on Hollywood Blvd.",NycLwl
50,Inside Tour of the Oscars,"The guided Theatre Tour was wonderful, taking you into the 3400 seat theatre and backstage. We could really imagine what it's like on Oscar night! Well worth it!",sandi28

50,For Oscars fans this is a must do.,"Great tour experience with a small group. Tickets are sold in the lower level for 19 (adult) and the tours last about 30 minute.

30,Might be more exciting on Awards Night.,"Not much to see, but a great place to snap a picture of friends or family who love the stars.

Sitting in the audience you couldn't help but look around and admire the grandeur - which IS breathtakingly grand! - and to think of all the famous people who have occupied these seats. Any seat you choose might have been shared by a former Academy Award hopeful, nominee, or award winner.If you have the chance to be at an event in this theater, don't miss it!",ReillyClan
50,No photos allowed but still great!,"Unfortunate that you couldn't take photos but the recent history and glamour of this building makes it a must visit for movie buffs and filmmakers like me.

30,Not much to see,"We took a guided tour through the Dolby Theatre with a small group of people. Our guide was informative and entertaining, however there wasn't a lot to see. The theatre itself is lovely and if you are a fan of the Oscars, you'll enjoy walking through the theatre the same way your favorite celebrities do. Unfortunately a TV commercial was being shot in the theatre so it was busy and noisy on stage and we couldn't get any good photos.",megang989

40,The tour!,"At first, we hesitated about attending the tour or not. Then we did attend even though it is costly for a half an hour tour where you see no attractions. However at the end we were so happy to have attended, it was so much fun and it is the only way you can feel the magic of Oscars. The tour guide gave many tips that we had not heard before and some gossip :) You even go on the stage and you can sing or dance if you wish :) I strongly advise this tour to everyone who has the time. (You can get a 3$ discount per ticket if you first visit the kiosk in front of the theater, the give you a kind of brochure and when you go to ticket kiosk with that broshure, you pay 3$ less)",iremse
50,America's Got Talent,"It was fun getting to witness a taping of a TV show. The Dolby Theatre is a lovely venue, and we were happy with the seats were able to sit in with our free tickets. The show got a little long and we left before it was complete. If it is taping, it's a fun evening for your family. We were traveling with teenagers, but there were some kids younger there. There was nothing inappropriate said or done when we were there.",oldtravelagent
40,Good tour,Took the 30-40 minute tour. You get to stand on the stage where Oscar winners get to stand. Group was small (10-12 people) and the tour guide was very informative. $19 is not cheap for a 30 min tour but you can only do this in this theater I guess....,Oliver J

They're in Hollywood this week. I encourage everyone to go. Tickets are free and it's loads of fun!! The Dolby Theatre is amazing!!!!! This is an awesome opportunity to get into the classy place where so many special and exclusive events are held. It's impressive how huge the theatre is inside. Be prepared to pay $20 to park for the day. Go early and enjoy the Walk of Fame and all the craziness of the people in Hollywood. We live here and really never tire of it.,Carol M
50,"Beautiful Interior, Great Audio","Went to see Paleyfest at the Dolby Theatre! Great seats, even though we were at Parterre Left, we could still see the faces on the people onstage. The whole theatre itself felt glamorous, and the audio was superb-- I mean, it IS the Dolby Theatre. ;) We didn't take any tour and didn't have time to look around, so I don't know how much you're really able to see of Dolby Theatre if you had the leisure, while there to see a show and not to do the tour. But I think, it's better to experience a show there anyway than just look at it.The area surrounding it felt safe at night, if anything it is right next to the Hollywood and Highland Mall so there are always plenty of people and if you're hungry, the restaurants and clubs are open late.",kk_vacay

40,"Oscar's home with a view to the tiny ""Hollywood"" sign.","Dolby Theater, which was previously known as Kodak Theater, is a home of Academy Awards ceremony. The entrance of the theater is decorated with the names of films, which won Oscar for the best picture year by year. There is also a lot of ""reserved"" slots for the future films to appear for another couple of decades.It is not a random choice to hold ceremony here because this theater is located at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Another reason is a direct view to the famous ""Hollywood"" sign from theater's balconies. However, the sign is so tiny that you will need to use a tele lens in order to capture the letters on the hill to see them enlarged later. As a result, you can assume that taking a selfie on your phone with a sign on the background can be a bad idea unless you want to see yourself on the background of a hill with some white dirt on it.",Lalaki-Papaki

50,Stand on the stage of the Oscars!!,"The Dolby Theatre was probably the highlight of our trip! My husband and I had a personal tour of the facility and it was really exciting! The Theatre itself is immaculate and now I know why it is the home of the Oscars, it truly is fit for the stars. We were able to see where the biggest names in Hollywood host their on site (private) after party's where they actually have an Oscar in the room that was presented to the Dolby Theatre. We actually got to stand ON STAGE and that was a very surreal feeling. Just thinking of all the people that have walked across the stage accepting honors, I'll never be able to watch the Oscar's the same again. Our guide was amazing. He answered all of our questions and showed us so much more because it was a personal tour. After leading us off stage, he led us to the back where the stars must go and up the "" winners hallway"" towards the Lowe's hotel before talking to the media. He then took us to the private balcony seating where all the Academy Board Members sit before exiting and giving us even more history of the theatre. There is a LOT of information I could disclose but I would rather you take the tour and ask the questions and have them show you personally. It makes it so interesting.I must say it has a WOW factor! I have been on the stage of the Grand 'Ol Opry and the experience I had at the Dolby doesn't even compare! Beautiful, Beautiful theatre and very informative tour!",THE-TW0-BEES
50,Brilliant & informative,"What a wonderful experience to be able to walk and sit where the movie stars celebrate their night of nights! Wonderful tour guide who was funny, informative and answered all questions. It was great to walk the back halls to see where people wait and are taken to for photos & interviews. Sitting in the different seats gave a good perspective of what the stage looks like up close. Standing on the stage and looking out it was great to see the photos on the chairs where stars have actually sat. It was great to hear how the ""stand ins"" for the stars works so there is no empty seats in the auditorium and how the Lowes Hotel next door is utilised. Also interesting how the outdoors is prepared and how you get to sit up close in the seats outside! It's a pity you can't take cameras or recorders into the venue. You even get to hold a real Academy Award! This is just a really great tour to see while in Hollywood.Sales office in the complex downstairs or you can ask your hotel to organise. Ticket was $14.oo for an adult. 323-308-6333 or groupsales@dolbytheatre.com",Leannamarie63

We got to sit in the seats in the second level and look down on the stage where the Oscars are handed out. Since I'm a huge fan of the Academy Awards, it was pretty special to be right where all the Hollywood elite spend an evening. Our only complaint was that the tour was not quite 30 minutes. I do recommend visiting the theater, if you're a movie/Academy Award buff!",divenut95
50,Awesome!!!,"Just being in the building where the Oscars have been awarded is enough, but to walk in the footsteps of all those famous actors and actresses is amazing, then to actually stand on the stage looking out at all the seats is brilliant, they even put photos on some of the chairs to show you where the winners were actually sitting, down point was no filming or photos, although you do get a postcard of the inside of the theatre for free!",Joe L
50,Excellent place to see a show,"We saw the Thelonius Monk Jazz Competition last night. It was our first time at the Dolby.We sat in the 3rd row of the Third Mezzanine section- the ""cheap seats"". I was very pleased- the venue is beautiful. The theater is very steep, so even when you are in the top deck you are not that far from the stage. The seats are very comfortable and you have no problems seeing the stage. The sound quality was also excellent.A great place to see a show!",vacationman18

Its just amazing how much effort goes into a single night of broadcasting with the ""stars""",BGarbus
50,Nice view of the Hollywood sign.,We weren't planning on going here but strolled around while waiting for the Hard Rock to open. Very pleased when we stumbled on the Hollywood sign view in the back. Nike had some event there do the re carpet was rolled out and that was pretty neat. I am not really a television person so I am sure someone who is would be way more impressed. Not saying I wasn't cause it was cool to see but wasn't overly excited.,christinad2010

The walk with the stars is incredible to see as well.",DLSproul
40,Good but Chinese Theatre is better,$20 charge is get in for a 20 min tour. The highlight is getting to walk on stage and look out into the auditorium.

I wish I would have been able to buy tickets for a show, instead of the tour, but nothing was available at the time I was there.So our guide was very nice and helpful. She was detailed and showed us around the theater, what was happening where during Oscar week. She had stories and explanation of every place around the theater.Like others here, I don't understand why we cannot take photographs. It would have made it better for me.We saw the VIP room, an oscar, the theater and place cards, where the cameras with speech cards placed, the back elevator going to the press room, the hallway leading to the hotel, etc.It was about 30 minutes, but fun and I'll see the Oscars differently now.",Isa b

20,Dolby theatre tour,"I’m glad that the Dolby theatre tour is included in my LA Go Card, so I don’t have to actually “pay” for the tour. In my opinion, the tour is pretty worthless. It’s a 20 minutes tour and it costs 20$. Actually the tour guide will just bring you to the theatre stage so you can see the theatre. Photo is not allowed during the tour. They will give you a “post card” as consolation at the end of the tour. Save your 20$ for other tour!",Nohead88
40,Well,"You know how everybody jumps on a fad and have to see it or do it, well this is kust one of those things that you would categorize with that.Its pretty cool to see all the winning oscar movies along all the pillars as you walk up the stairs. Walk back the opposite way on the balcony and the future dates are all there waiting for the next great film.From there it's basically another tourist trap with its high end stores (which are practically empty while we were there) and the few odd picture spots.At least 20 min and you should be satisfied.Didn't bother taking the tour cause ive seen it on tv in HD. Cant be much of a diff lol",bradr879
40,Not what we expected,"My husband is a home theatre and dolby fan, he wanted to do this tour but was not what he expected, it turned out the tour was more of an interest for me and not him as it was all about the Oscars!!Let me start by saying the guide was great very informative and you cant take any photos inside the theatre or building. You are taken to various rooms and get to stand on the stage where the Oscars are hosted and walk where they walk after they collect their awards. If you are a Hollywood fan I would suggest this, it takes about 1hr for the tour and you get a free postcard at the end. Nice surprise!!",Frequentoztravellers

The tour took 45 min and was about 17$ per adult, cheaper for children. If you buy tickets inside the special booth which is in the shopping mall you get them slightly cheaper. I was surprised that the theatre is inside a shopping mall but the guide told us everything about the preparations for the Big Day and actually what happened on the evening. He told many quite funny stories which we enjoyed.We actually stood on the stage where the Oscars were presented and that was great. The guide had plenty of time for us. I would go again, no problem.",suitcase0810

The tour guide was very knowledgable and took the time to answer any questions asked. We were excited to be able to walk out on the stage of the theatre that we see so often on award shows, even though we could not take any pics.Wear comfortable shoes, and try to get there early. There are elevators for part of it, but to stay with the tour group, there are also flights of stairs.",jrpleasant

30,The tour is only worth it if you LOVE all things Oscar,"In order to get in the Dolby theatre we paid for the tour ($17 adult, $12 student). It was great to be in there and to learn a little Oscar trivia, but for 25 minutes it really was kind of a rip off. The only cost to bringing people in the theatre is the semi-disinterested guide so do they really need to charge that much?",kagardner

30,Holly Weird for sure,"Like our visit to Universal studios this attraction was mobbed by absolutely crazy and rude tourists. There really isn't much to see or do at night. And if you are like us and purchase a City Pass, be advised that no one will accept it after 5:30pm. You will be accosted by people in costume pretending to be Don King, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna...to pose with you for pictures and then hit you up for $$$....that they tell you about after they pull you in.

50,Take a Tour with Oscar . . . Well Worth It!,"Tourist or not, this was a delightful and informative tour of the home of the Oscars! If you enjoy movies and the Academy Awards, take the tour! Formerly called the Kodak Theatre, the Dolby Theatre is currently the home for the annual Academy Awards. There is a fee for the tour which takes about 45 minutes; discounts are available for Seniors, and we found that if you inquire at the Visitor Center in the front, you may be able to get a $3 discount coupon. It is a guided tour which provides marvelous information about the theatre and the awards ceremony. Having seen some negative reviews of this tour, I think that much depends (as with any tour) on your guide; ours was excellent, and the time passed quickly. You get to see the backstage area and look out over the seating area complete with some photos of celebs and where they sat for the last ceremony; you also see the VIP lounge (with an Oscar on display), the lobby with lovely pics of past Oscar recipients, and walk down the wide steps to the area below. This with an informative tour guide made the Dolby Theatre tour a hit for our group! Without question, of all the tours we took in Hollywood, the Dolby Theatre was one of the most enjoyable; we highly recommend it.",Carl A
50,Permanent home of the Academy Awards,"Before this theater was built in 2001, the Academy Awards were held at a different venue each year. Now, they have a nice permanent home right in the heart of Hollywood.I took the tour, which is $17 a person for adults. (Check with the tourist information desk at street level for a $3 off coupon.) The tour lasts about half an hour and you can ask any questions you like as you go through the theatre, backstage, and then actually onstage where you can see cards on chairs with pictures of stars showing where they sat at the last awards.The stairways were built especially for women with high heels and long dresses, which means the steps are short and wide. You'll get a chance to see an actual Oscar as well as see where the stars dressing rooms are, how the stage is built, and where the winners are taken to meet the media right after accepting. This is one of the few tours I took in Hollywood and highly recommend it.",Freed0mt0travel
50,Worth a visit,"This tour is definitely worth a visit. My friend and I went and we were so glad that we managed to go on this tour. You get an exclusive look into the theatre where the Oscars take place. Our guide, David, was great and happy to answer any questions. You aren't allowed to take photos but I don't think that takes away any enjoyment from the tour. The last tour is 4pm and it lasts 30 minutes. If you go to the tourist office just outside you can get $3 off per person.",bumblebee_bay86
50,Take the Tour,"If you enjoy movies, movie history and related things, take the tour! You'll get to sit in the theater and find out what goes on in the backstage of one of the largest and most important award cerimonies in the world. Cool! Cool! Cool! Don't miss it!",Renata C
40,Exciting tour to home of oscars,So excited to visit home of oscars and trilled we actually saw an oscar. Our tour guide will was excellent. It seems a pricey tour at 17 dollars but it is worth it.Beware the tourist info centre at the entrance to Hollywood highland centre told us that there were no tours today but we went to the Dolby box office under the stairs and booked on straight away ! No toilets available on the tour.,Jasper20
20,Glad we had a LA go card and didn't have to pay directly for this tour!,"Very rushed, no pics, boring and not very knowledgeable guide!would not recommend talking a family on this tour, definitely for older age groups.",Julie V
50,Absolutely touring is worth the visit!,"I went to this theater for the tour. The tour is offered every 30 minutes and is $12 per person if you are a AAA member. The tour lasts approximately 40-45 minutes (goes by quickly). If you aren't, go to the tourist information desk downstairs and get $4 off per person from the $17 normal rate!What you will see: the Dolby Digital VIP lounge (with an Oscar on display), the lobby with lovely pics of Oscar recipients and of course the seating area. Also you will see photos of where the celebrities actually sat at the last telecast.If you are an Academy Award/Oscar buff, this venue is totally worthwhile to be paid a visit.They do not allow photos inside, so I sneaked only a few. :-)",traveler4k
50,Our own tour,"My family and I came to the Dolby after a cruise to Ensenada, this place was massive and beautiful we didn't get a chance to go inside because it was so early but what a wonderful site.",mrose72
50,Dolby Theatre tour - value for money.,"Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, LA is the place where annual Oscar Award ceremony takes place. But to get inside the theatre one has to take a guided tour which costs 17 USD. I feel it is certainly worth it. Fortunately, there was not much of a waiting period when we went there, though it was a Saturday. There is a guided tour every 30 minutes which lasts for 30 minutes, and the guide, who answers all your questions very patiently, conducts us through the theatre, the main entrance, the green room and finally the stage where the awards are given away. The red carpet and the minute details that go in for making the ceremony a spectacular show is something we should not miss while in LA. Taking photographs inside the theatre is strictly forbidden. Strongly recommend this tour.",RameshMysore
40,Tour,"Had a private tour through the Dolby theater. The young men told me nice story's about this theater, and he showed me everything. It was not allowed to take picture, which it was a pity.",Liprij
50,Excellent Tour,"Tickets for this tour are available for purchase on the ground level of Hollywood & Highland. I went around 11 hoping to get on the 11:30 tour. Tours were sold out until 2:30, but I was not sure if I would be back from a bus tour I was scheduled on so I did not purchase tickets. My other tour ended ten minutes early and I was still able to join the 2:30 tour about 5 minutes before it started.The tour is very well laid out, starting in the lobby and explaining how Oscar guests arrive, setup, preparation etc. Then you are brought into the VIP lounge where you can see an actual Oscar up close on display in a glass case. The flow of the tour is dictated by any special events that might be going on, but we were lucky enough that the stage was free for us to visit. It's a very interesting experience to stand on the stage and look out. It's quite a bit different from watching on TV. After having our ""Oscar Moment"" we continued by taking the ""Winner's Walk."" This is how the stars are escorted off stage and led to the press. We took a quick stop to visit one of the balcony seats, before being led to the exit and end of the tour.I thoroughly enjoyed the tour and all the great information the guide provided. Unfortunately, photography is not allowed, but you do get a postcard of the interior as a parting gift. The tour is advertised as 30 minutes, but ours came in at 45 minutes because our guide allowed us to ask as many questions as we wanted. At only $17 per adult, I thought it was a great deal and would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves movies or backstage tours.",anonymous9257
40,You must STOP by and take a look!,Of course you have watched the Academy Awards on TV! When you take a tour of the Dolby Theatre you’ll have a different perspective when you watch the Academy Awards in the future. Amazing what they have to do and the transformation this place takes on to prepare for the Awards. Must see while you are in LA!,VaSpeters56
50,Walking in the footsteps of legends!,"This is an Oscar orientated tour. It was enjoyable informative and a lot of fun! Our tour guide was full of information for whatever questions we fired at her! If you love your movies, this tour should not be missed!The only fault with this tour - not photography of any type!",Joyce K
50,Cheap And Great Tour,"The tour of the Dolby Theatre (previously the Kodak theatre) is a must for any theatre or Oscar fan.Since the Dolby Theatre was built for the Oscars, the tour is focused on the subject. They explain the preparation that goes into the event and what happens during it. You do get to go on the stage itself and can do an ""Oscar speech"" if you so choose.The tour itself was $17 USD per adult which is quite reasonable compared to other attractions in LA. The tours are every half an hour and are purchased at the Dolby Theatre box office. I did the tour as a spur of the moment decision and did not need an advanced reservation.",42ryanh
30,Red Carpet,The Dolby Theatre (aka Kodak Theatre) is where the Oscars are held! We went with LA tours in February and that part of street was closed for preparation of the Oscars and they were rolling out the red carpet while we were walking the walk of fame.,Smeets P
30,Academy Awards Ceremony,"Oscar! How could you miss it if you are visiting LA? Though not the very best spot to visit but you will get an idea of Oscar night and rec carpet area. Throughout the year, it hosts different shows and if you have time you should see some shows in this theater. There is also a walk tour available with some fee which gives you much better idea about Academy Awards history and how the theater turns out during the main event. Lots of brand store is also available on the 1st level of this theater.",Tanzir M
40,"Saw Concert - Parterre Seats - Good Seats, Getting to Parking - hell","We saw the IL Divo concert at this theater. I decided not to buy the nearest seats this time, but went for the Parterre Seats. For the price, I paid I thought it was a great deal!Bought tickets via TicketMaster. Clicking on the Ticket Type- I saw that aside from ""Full Price Ticket"" there were other options. I noticed that there was a TZOO option, which I knew was Travelzoo. Hopped on the travelzoo website, saw the promo coupon, and got a substantial saving.Anyway, this place is not really really big, such that the first floor where the orchestra seats are located is not so big. Thus, the parterre seats are not so far from the stage. But of course, closer is better. But the sound system was great at the Parterre locations. Note, there are other level seats - those I cannot opine.Ok parking. Make sure you bring your ticket. We grabbed a sandwich before hitting the concert since we were running late. So fast food it is. Seems you get a $2 validation of some sort. So make sure you get your ticket validated. (Forgot to mention, Dolby Theater is within a big mall.)You need to pay at a vending machine before you pick up your car to leave. There are vending machines where you can pay with credit card and/or cash in pretty much each floor. You'll see them located at an area before you exit to the parking area. On the floor where we were paying, I saw 2 vending machines.After the show, OMG trying to get to the parking lot was a nightmare. The line on the vending machines to pay for parking, the escalators, and stairs were so crowded and so slow. So if you are coming out of a concert, you might as well seat down for 20 minutes or so before you brave getting to your parking lot.",rrkkjones
30,You should visit inside,"The visit isn't the best but give you a better idea of the Oscars location, the outside is more like a small mall with restaurants and stores. The street itself isn't worth it, spend you time somewhere else in LA, there is too many better spots.",CdnTravelFan
50,How could you miss this?,"If you are visiting LA you have to check out the the TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman's Chinese Theatre) home of the Star's footprints and handprints. Your visit will also take you to the Walk of Fame and old Hollywood with its amazing architecture.Previously, in the 80s and 90s, Hollywood was a miserably run down, somewhat dangerous area. It has undergone an amazing renovation and is now a vibrant, great place to visit.",IBenevolentDictatorI
40,"Excellent venue, even from the tippy top!","Bought a ticket to the Neil Young show this past week and realized I was in the very very last row. Wow. You are wayyyy up there. Thankfully my vertigo didn't kick in. ; ) Not sure if it was at Neil Young's request, or the venue, but no photos or recording of any kind were allowed, which I think is completely obnoxious considering the amount of money you pay to see a show these days, but whatever.Other than the fact that there were no screens for people past the first section to SEE Neil Young without the use of binoculars, the sound quality was superb. The stage setup was really very cool. 3 of his pianos and a variety of guitars as well as maybe 15 harmonicas laid out on top of one of the pianos.Simple yet beautiful.I'd post a picture, but....alas. Oh, and I thought it was very inappropriate to allow people to be up and walking around constantly to get drinks, etc during such a QUIET, INTIMATE show. My vote, people are only allowed to get up between songs. But....Neil Young...He was fantastic! Solo and acoustic is the BEST way to see a show.Parking at the Hollywood & Highland complex wasn't so bad. Price was fair as far as parking goes. Not nearly as bad getting out as I had feared. It's safe, well lit and right on site. Be sure to get your ticket validated at Customer Service on the 1st floor by MAC. And don't forget to pay at the machine (in line with everyone else!) before you leave. Great place to hang out, people watch, shop and/or eat before a performance.Overall, I would definitely consider seeing another show at the Dolby.",Sally M
50,Very interesting tour - worth the money,It was worth the money. You really get the inside track on what happens on Oscar night and why the Acedemy awards are now called the Oscars. It was very interesting and you got to sit in the theatre in the front row. They explained the logisitics of the awards and how it happens and insider information. It was all very interesting. I'd definitely recommend it.,LounBee
40,Venue of the Oscars,"It was an amazing experience to be in the Dolby Theatre, a day before the Oscars and stand on the Red Carpet. The theatre is not a great attraction but if you are in Hollywood, you should visit it.",Ashlesh
40,Interesting Tour,We enjoyed getting the tour and hearing about the experiences of Oscar night. Our tour guide was well informed and had many stories to share of his experiences working during the academy awards.,varipaul
20,Perhaps somewhat overrated,"There is nothing spectacular about this place. Not sure what the big deal is, unless it is Oscar night.You may want to spend about 15-30 mins here, get a few pictures taken and get back to other places in LA",smhr
50,Hollywood Glamour,Located in the heart of Hollywood this is an awesome place to visit -so impressive! This was on our GO Los Angeles card so we saved some money( always a plus) and our tour was great. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We loved standing center stage as well as visiting the hallway showcasing past winners that the stars walk thru after receiving their own Oscars. When we tuned in to watch the Oscars this past weekend it was so fun to know we had been there and could imagine Ellen Degeneres getting ready for her hosting duties in the private room they had shown to us.I felt like a Hollywood insider:)) Note the Dolby is actually part of a mall complex so that there is also food and shopping nearby. They cover all this over with huge curtains for the Oscars. They stated that some celebrities are probably not even aware of what is behind the curtains. It is also important to bear in mind that 2 weeks before the telecast the Dolby Theatre is closed to visitors.,Dianna A
50,Gorgeous theater.,We took the tour of the Dolby Center and loved it! The guide was great and very knowledgeable. It was fun seeing the theater and the back stage and hallways; where is just a couple of weeks the Academy awards would be held. Fun.,Sandy2645
50,Academy Awards (Oscars),"Everyone is impressed by the the Acady Awards! If you would like to see the place, where this annual ceremony takes place, you will have to visit it. Since the awards returned to Hollywood in 2001 they are hosted permanently by Dolby Theater. There is a fee only if you take the tour. If you just want to see the building there is no charge of course!",rigasspy
40,Have a Academy Awards experience,We took the 10.30am guided tour to have a close look of the venue of Academy Awards ceremony. The tour guide was a nice and friendly person. She shared with us some Academy-Awards-behind-scene-stories and the preparation that is done every year for this big event. We had a close look of the gold statue and the tour guided told us some details about it. We walked through where award winners walk through. We stood on the stage where the award announcements are made and winners receive their gold statues. The whole tour gave us an unique experience that we can't have anywhere else. You should give it a go.There are a Kelly chocolate and some other restaurants inside the building. You could have breakfast there before the tour. You can see the famous Hollywood sign from the 2nd floor and therefore you should get your camera ready.Dolby Theatre is on Hollywood Blvd and a local bus driver told us that there were a lot of pickpockets. Be careful about your wallet. It is easy to go to there. You should hop off the train at Hollywood/Highland station and this attraction is just within a walking distance.,Diana_Chow
40,Must do!,"A must do when visiting LA! A hive of atmosphere but a little seedy outside. However, well worth the visit. We bought a combination ticket and it was well worth it! This is a must do for all cinema lovers!",samiraLBhales
40,Must do in LA,"Must to do if you are a movie lover. It´s very impressive. You can combine this visit with other attarctions in the same region/place (bus tour, walk of fame, etc)... search on line to tickets that combine these attractions.",LuxSkypeWalker
40,Nice to see where the Oscar Award Show takes place,It was very nice to see the Dolby Theatre (previous Kodak Theatre) in LA. It has an amazing front and good looking interior design. And it was also interesting to see the listed best picture movies from each year in the past.I didn't booked any tours which I think not is a must experience as I am not big Oscar Award Show fan.A great must-see stuff in LA.,Mads
30,Fun but I think we missed some things,"This was a really interesting tour, it *was* cool to be ""where the stars go"", and see it all in person. You really can't grasp the enormity of the place unless you have been there. We did not get to see or go into the lower area, as there was a set for some show being constructed (or taken down) when we toured in September 2012. So, we were up in the balcony. I was quite nervous as I have a fear of heights and we also had our 28 month old son with us, so I was busy keeping him safe. I would like to go back some time and be able to see the lower area too. The bar with the glass walls that obscure line of sight was really neat to see. Our tour was included in our purchase of the ""Go Los Angeles"" cards that we got, otherwise I don't know that we'd have done it separately.",Tami P
40,Very cool,"Did the 30 minute tour of the dolby (previous kodak) theatre. Was really cool to be on the stage where the oscars are held. It's as close as i'll ever get unfortunately :( Was a nice tour with a good guide, very thorough. Highly recommend doing the tour if you have the time!",cksteeve
40,nice,"It was nice to be able to climb the stairs the stars climb to get their Oscars! :] We wish we had taken the tour, though, to get to know a bit more. NIce atmospehere around the buidling.",christiano_10
50,FANTASTIC VISIT,"City Pass had an option for this tour and I am so glad I did this! Every year I am glued to the TV when the Oscars are on and now I got to sit in the seats themselves! Sadly not on the ground floor as they were setting up for the next award show, but the tour guide takes you backstage and shows you the different areas. You learn some interesting facts about the ceremony and the building. Sadly no photos are allowed inside but all the more reason to pay attention. I can only highly recommend this!",Marijke J
50,Fantastic inside peek at the Oscars,This was a great tour with so much cool information about the preparation for the Oscars and what actually happens on the night. You get to stand on the stage ( if you're lucky ) and also go on the Winners Walk - do the tour to find out what happens once you win an Oscar and how it all works. The theatre was built especially for the Oscars and has great trivia and VIP access that you would never get unless you are nominated or a presenter. Cool.,travelstoryAus
30,Good to tick off the list,Very informative tour of the dolby theatre which doesn't drag on. I'd recommend for any movie fan but if you're not into movies etc id struggle to identify a unique selling point of this attraction. Its probably the only reason to visit hollywood blvd in my opinion. In terms of architecture the theatre is no different to any other i've been in but the fact that it the home of the oscars gives it that 'je ne sais quoi'Be warned - no photos allowed and the photograph they give you at the end is somewhat grainy!,Colin M
40,Nice Tour,"We went on the tour of the Dolby Theater. It was enjoyable, and it was nice to see the interior of the theater. Our tour guide was nice and gave a detailed history of the Oscars and the theater itself. Unfortunately, pictures were not allowed in the theater, and we were only given a poor quality post card at the end of the tour. Nonetheless, the tour was interesting, and I recommend it for anyone who likes the Oscars or Hollywood in general.",radx4
40,And the Oscar Goes To....,"This 30 minute tour is more about the Academy Awards than the actual theater, but well worth it! Me and my girlfriends truly enjoyed hearing all about the preparation that happens weeks prior to the event, the red carpet, how the stars must go through security, how it takes them up to 2 hours to walk the red carpet (due to interviews w/the media), how seating is arranged, ""seat fillers"", where stars go after they win, etc. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and told us some cool facts and stories! It's very ""Hollywood""! We had this tour included in our Hollywood CityPass. (We paid $59 for the CityPass and it got us 4 different tours.) I'd highly recommend this tour!",Barb826
40,Great behind the scenes tour,"Was really pleased to take in this tour of the Academy Awards facility. So even though it cost $17 (a bit steep?!) I think it was mostly worth the experience of seeing the inside of the theatre and the lobby where the Oscars are awarded. Like others, we had a small group - just five of us - so it was really informal. Our guide was very knowledgable and entertaining. We did not get to go on stage but we did see where the stars go once they receive their Oscars. I really enjoyed the tour and would highly recommend it. Must see for anyone who has watched the four-plus hour awards ceremony",John K
50,Great tour of Dolby Theater,"We did the 30 minute tour of the Dolby Theater. It was only $17 and there were only 6 of us on the tour. The tour guide was not great, but still very informative. You get to go on the stage, up in one of the private boxes and the room where the Governor's Ball is. He explained how all the seating is determined",Patrick D
40,Place for Movie Fans,"Most of the Hollywood is for Movie Fans , but Dolby theater must be the Temple for Movie Fans as it hosts the Oscar Awards. For me , it was just another Good theater but with a ""Brand Tag"".You can walk around the Galleries and see pictures and stuff , but pictures are not allowed.there is nothing else to do here except watching the Oscars ( if you get a chance)",Sharnjit_Sondh
40,only for Oscars fans,"If you are an Oscar fan, and are interested in the behind the scenes and the cerimony itself, visit it because you will be satisfied. If you couldn' t care less about the Oscars, don' t visit. It' s just a nice theatre, but nothing spectacular. ps. you' re not allowed to take pictures, which is a bit weird given that there' s nothing secret to see :) it' s just a theatre with chairs and a stage :) but the guide was very nice, friendly and very well prepared. Great for Oscars fans!",MarioNer944

40,Short but sweet!,"The tour lasts 30mins which sounds short but it's just the right length. My wife is an Oscars nut so she thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not in any way interested in the Oscars but I still found the tour enjoyable. Our guide, David, was a lovely guy who was able to answer any questions the wife threw at him.",JGilleese

40,Interesting tour worth doing,"We decided to do this 30min tour and I have to say we enjoyed it very much. First print off coupons for $2 discount per adult and buy tickets $15 per adult, $12 kids on the 1st floor. Entrance 2nd floor for this informative tour regarding past and present Oscar awards. See and hear what really happens on the famous night and lots of little enlightening stories along the way. No photos/video can be taken. If I have a negative it was a little short but I'd still say... go and do it and enjoy.",SunshineForever1
50,Interesting tour if you are an Oscars fan,"Bummed that you aren't allowed to take pictures, but it was such an interesting tour. Loved seeing all the behind the scenes stories of what goes on during the Academy Awards.",Christy
50,A really interesting tour,You couldn't take pictures which was a little bit disappointing but the tour we took around the theatre was filled with interesting antidotes and stories about the Oscars. It felt like you had real behind the scenes access and I would thouroughly recommend this tour to anyone even remotely interested in the oscars.,James A
40,Oscar Fans & Great Venue for shows,"The theater is an excellent place if you want to feel the touch of the red carpet and see where all the stars and attendees go. The theater is surprisingly smaller than it appears on television and during a performance can feel very intimate and connected to the stage.They do give tours of the theater when it is not in use, but do to the high rent, shows have a hard time staying there permanently such as the Cirque du Soleil show ""Iris"" wasn't able to make enough money to pay the rent to stay in the theater, but they still have shows that are available, you just need to check their website.http://www.dolbytheatre.com",The_Roaming_Raven
50,Very enjoyable tour,"This short, half hour tour is well worth doing, if you've ever watched the Academy Awards. It's lots of fun to wander through the building you see the stars enter each year and to hear how they set the building up in preparation (including hiding the fact there are stores there!) Our tour guide was very good and a nice, parting touch is the postcard they give you of the view from the stage, which is not sold anywhere but given just to people who take the tour.",Kathy B
50,A must see for movie and oscar buffs,"From the start you are shown the lobby lined with pictures of past oscar moments and see more as you go along, the tour has some history but focused more on the current theatre. The tour lasted 30 minutes and you see behind the scenes in an informative way. Beware that pictures can not be taken but we received a picture postcard in the end. Not recommended for those not interested in movies or the oscars",Glen E
30,Kathy Griffin Comedy Show,"We saw Kathy Griffin here a few months ago and I go back and forth about how I liked (and didn't like) this theater. The indoor lobby/foyer is absolutely amazing. It is spacious with many large, beautifully framed photos on the walls of actors winning their Oscars and memorable Oscar moments. There are fantastic photos/frames on every floor. There are also large staircases (and elevators) that take you up to the nosebleed section.Having said that, our tickets were in the nosebleed section. We made our way up to the top and as we entered the actual theater, we started to have issues. First off, it's not pretty or glamorous inside the actual theater. Also, I'm sure it's a lot better down at the bottom level, but at the top, there is no room to move. You can barely walk down an aisle to your seat, even when there's no one sitting yet. Then when you finally get to your seat, you feel very squished. It is also very steep/high up. I've been to TONS of venues before but sitting up top at the Dolby Theater was definitely the worst. If you have to see a show here, spend a little more money and try to get tickets on the bottom level.I'd love to come back to do a tour of the theater. Maybe I'd appreciate it a little more.",Jenny R
40,A must do in Hollywood,"Being a big movie fan, the Academy awards are a must every year. This is the place where it happens and you get to so what it is like behind the scenes and get a history lesson too. The tour takes through the front atrium and the executive lounge where they have an actual Oscar on display. Then you are taken back stage to the dressing rooms and onstage where the magic happens. I was hoping we would get to sit in the seats but that did not happen. They do have some placards where some of this past years nominees sat. Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman. It was as if they knew Jessica Chastain wasn't going to win, she so seated in the middle of a row. You are then escorted through winners walk where you see previous winners. They don't allow pictures of course but they give you a postcard of the inside of the theatre when you leave.",Disnyfan
50,Must See!,"We did the Dolby tour on our recent visit. It is only a short tour, but worth a visit for sure. Unfortunately no photographs are permitted on this tour. It would of been nice to take some photos of where the celebs have their awards night. It combines the new with old. The foyer of the Theatre seems modern, but the inside where the celebs are seated for the award shows seems old and classic.",AliBla

50,and the winner is...,"If you are an Academy Awards fan, this is a must do. The tour is not expensive (especially with the online coupon). You get to tour the whole theater-dressing rooms, go onstage, tunnel walk after you win the award. The only downside is that you do not get to take photographs. They said it is for security reasons so no one has entry/exits in print. I guess with that exclusive audience and times as they are, security needs to be an issue. Nonetheless we enjoyed the tour!",dgrunsten
50,Kodak Theatre Shines,"The Kodak Theatre, recently renamed the Dolby Theatre, is a beauty, reminscent of the art deco theatres of the past. We were impressed with design, layout, sound system and comfortable seats when we attended Cirque du Soleil's Iris.",JSW842

40,Fast and Fantastic Tour!,"This was a good surprise, we were visiting the area attractions: Chinese Theater, El Capitan and the Walk of Fame - and we went just for a quick peek at the Kodak Theater (now Dolby Theater).At its main entrance, we noticed a sign telling about the tours - 30 minutes length and $15 per person. They have a tour for each half hour, starting at 10am. It was GREAT: first, you start visiting the area they never show during the Oscar's TV broadcast - the entrance lounge, the stairs for the different areas of the venue. After this, you have a chance to walk inside the theater, around the stage, etc - it is amazing. For last, the guide will show the ""winner's walk"" - what happens after the winner gets the Oscar. Important: no restrooms and no video / photos during the whole tour.",Cesilv
40,Great tour.,"There was a group of maybe 20 of us on the guided tour of the theatre. It is mainly used for the Oscars and it was interesting to see the history behind the awards ceremony.The tour lasts around 30minutes and they tell you a lot of interesting facts (for example where the term 'silver screen' comes from and how the Oscars got its name). They take you into the VIP room, and the actual theatre. You get to go backstage and do the journey up to the press room that the winners do.There is no picture taking inside, but at the end of the tour they give you a postcard of the interior.",Natalie O
50,Interesting guided tour,"Took the guided tour. Our group was small and the guide, Justine, was great. Everyone could clearly hear her. She works there during the Oscars so she was able to give us many information and anecdotes about that special evening. I found the tour much more interesting than I expected.

20,Just a Mall,"Not impressed with either the outside of the theater or the fact that it is just a big outdoor mall. The worst part is the continual stream of Elvis iand Darth Vadar mpersonators one must wade through to get there. I feel story for the Stars that must come here for Award Ceremonies. Though the Theater has been renovated, the city outside is still trashy. Big disappointment!",MiamiOlivia
40,Busy During Oscar Time,"As they were preparing for the Oscars, understandingly they did not allow too much access to the area. The street was closed off to vehicle traffic but you were able to walk to the front of the theater to see the many famous actor's hand and foot prints. The ""Red Carpets"" were out but covered with plastic to protect them. Still it was cool to see. If I can, I would try to avoid this time of year in the future.",dlelonek

40,"amazing venue, especially for the cirque Du Sollie show","the kodak theater, today called the dolby theater, is in the hollywood and highland center. the center itself is very nice with a lot of interesting stores such as the sweet! (Willi wonka) store and the all Christmas store. there is also the performing staircase just at the exit to the Chinese theater.go inside the center and look to the east- you can see the hollywood sign between the levels of the stairs.the Kodak theater itself is fun to experience what all the celebrities enjoy when they come to the Oscar and seeing the cirque Du Sollie ""IRIS"" show is amazing by its own. the theater is built for those big performances and the show serves it well.i felt very luxurious entering the show and being seated by the staff.",amiroi

Bring your opera glasses unless you are sitting in the first 10 rows.",Vacannes
40,Home of the oscars,"It was a great feeling to think that I was at the same place where Hollywood stars gather every year for their oscars. Outside the theatre, you will find panels showing the movies which won best picture award each year. Must do in Hollywood",CalGirl84

40,This facility gets the Academy Award,"This facility has award winning style and elegance. You do not feel the crowds and the seating gives you a great view of the stage. The performances are generally top notch as well. There are shops located outside the theater. A great place to spend time before and after the show, as well as during intermission.",Richard L
30,Interesting but expensive,"I had a very personal tour as I was the only person on it! It is interesting to see the theatre where the Oscars are held, sit in a seat on the upper level (apparently where producers sit unless they are nominees) and see the VIP bar where the actors go, but at $12 for what for me was a 20min tour (perhaps shorter for me as I was on my own so less questions) it is expensive. How worth it is how much you value seeing where the Oscars take place I guess. If you do go, make sure you go to the visitors information booth, as you get $3 off if you ask, bringing the price down to $12 instead of $15.",CityGirlAimee

You can just go up the elevator and select dolby theatre and you are there.They validated for 2 hrs if you eat at one of the restaurants or maybe other places too (we had ours validated at the food court because we did not have enough time to eat at the sit down restaurants). The show was good. Its about 1.5 hrs with no intermission. If you guys plan to walk around Hollywood then the parking is just a flat rate of $10 per day. Chinese theatre is right next to it and also the walk of fame.Regarding the Iris, you can join the cirque du soleil website and buy your tickets through there. They have family deals and also deals just by being a member. I used their site all the time because I am a die hard Cirque du Soleil fan.",Matamis2000
50,IRIS,Attended the Cirque Du Soleil show Iris at the Kodak theater and had a wonderful time. The show was amazing but what surprised me was the entire highland complex itself. I thought for sure it would be too touristy and not worth much time but was pleasantly surprised. After the show we wandered the shops and had a great experience. It's worth at least a visit if you're in the neighborhood.,oscardwilde
40,Surprisingly Good,"We visited here whilst waiting to go onto another tour and had some time to kill, we got in free with our LA cards so thought we would give it a go.

30,IRIS at the Dolby Theatre,"We had a small dinner at a gastropub called BoHo inside the complex before the show, would not recommed the food, but they had a good beer selection. This was my 10th Cirque du Soleil show, and 4th show with my wife, so we were excited about seeing Iris and seeing what ""Hollywood"" had in store for the audience. Compared to ""O"" and ""Zarkana"" this show was lacking the awe factor that I have become accustomed to since seeing so many other productions. I would recommend this show for any one who is ""new"" to the Cirque du Soleil experience, but I cannot recommend it to anyone who has see any of the productions in Las Vegas.",JJSpersrud

40,Academy Awards!!,"On the last day of your stay at Hollywood, my family and I went to the Kodak Theater. We had to purchase tickets on the day.What we didn't know was that by doing this tour, it also gave you a dicount on the 'Iris' Cirque du Soleil show that was currently playing at the theater. As this was our last day in Hollywood, we didn't get to use these discount tickets for the show (which is at night).The tour ran on time and our guide was very helpful and seemed to have alot of knowlegde about the theater. We got to sit down in the room where the awards are held which was pretty special! We also got to see an oscar too!This tour goes for 30 mins to an hour so you dont need all day.",Kristen22_13_12

No photos allowed inside the Theatre but you will get the opportunity to see the actual theatre and sit in the chairs, see a real Oscar statuette, go inside the VIP lounge for the A celebrities. You will also get a lot of ""secrets"" about the Theatre and how the Oscar show is run. A must for your LA visit.",Runar P

50,Great tour,"I loved this tour, our guide was very knowledgeable and lots of fun. It is now called the Dolby theater because Kodak could no longer pay the name. This is the theater used for the Academy Awards, so it mostly talks about that and Cirque Du Soleil, which has a long-running show here. I thought this tour was fascinating and I would definitely recommend it.You can't take any photos at all :(",MickeyBinOz

40,Interesting Tour of the Former Kodak (now the Dolby) Theatre,"This tour is a great experience for film buffs as the Dolby is where the Academy Awards takes place annually. We had a great guide who told interesting personal stories as well as shared tales about the Academy Awards. Currently, Cirque du Soleil is in residence and will be there for 10 years, so access to most of the interior of the theater is limited. Our small group (12) sat in one of the upper balconies and were able to see much of the theater from there. Unfortunately, there's no back stage element to the tour which lasted approximately 30 minutes. Again, this will be of interest to those with an intense interest in the film industry. Others probably won't want to shell out the price of admission ($15 for adults and $10 for kids) for such a brief tour with limited access.",jsctraveler

Everyone on the tour was really disappointed that we couldn't take photos in the theatre itself (although you can take photos outside the building and on the steps leading up to the theatre inside the building). If you present your tour ticket at the box office you can get a discount for the Iris show for that evening.

50,If you love movies it's gonna be awesome,"The theater for me was really interesting because I have always loved cinematography and it's a great experience to learn about the Oscars history, however if you talk about the theater you can appreciate that it was built to host the oscars as a recording studio and not much as a real theater, which for me was a little disappointing. However is a place that you must go if you love cinematography.",CristianHP
30,Interesting but Overpriced,"My family, including two teens, did enjoy this tour. It is interesting to learn about the behind the scenes of the Oscars. However, we felt it was overpriced.

50,To Walk Where the Stars Have Been! Amazing!,"On our family trip to Los Angeles, we made a stop at the (now called Dolby Theatre) home to the Academy Awards, and it was just really neat to have a tour guide give us details on how the set-up of the award show is, & interesting facts about the stars that come. Getting a look inside the Dolby Theatre where all the stars and members of the Academy sit on the big night was very surreal. We used our Go Los Angeles card for this attraction, & I thought the only downfall was that we couldn't pre-book our tour, as they ask you to come check for tour availibilty the day of, but it turned out to work out just fine for us, as the Theatre is located inside the Hollywood & Highland Mall, and there seems to be plenty of space opened, and tours run every 30 minutes, so you can shop or walk around in the mean time.",307JenniferW

40,Must see for fans of the Oscars!,"The tour of the Kodak theatre was very cool! What I found especially interesting was the information that the tour guide gave us about how celebrities are escorted etc during the Oscars. Upon entering, the ""secretive"" bar room was also very cool. The whole place is, in general, extremely elegant. It felt interesting to be walking on the very ground on which celebrities galore walk on during the Oscars! I would definitely recommend a visit if you're in the area.",ceasar123
50,Renamed now....but a fine venue,Great location ....easy to get to on Metro Raiil....not so great by car (congestion)....beautifu motif....a great addition to Hollywood Blvd sleeze,Jerry C
40,A must for cinema lovers,"If you're a movie buff like me and you follow the Oscars year after year, this theater is a must see. The building is imposing, and although it looks better on TV, there are details inside the that you'll surely appreciate: Hollywood stories set in mosaic, the ""Awards Walk"" where the red carpet is laid down during Oscars, Oscar trophies on display, etc. Right outside the theater is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If there are street performers, pause and watch them - they're usually good. And, of course, you'll see your favorite movie / cartoon charaters (SnowWhite, Batman, Spiderman, Wonder Woman, etc.,) right at the entrance. You can take photos with them for a $1 tip.If you want to go on city tours, this is the perfect starting point. Right outside of the theater you will see tour booths -- I recommend the hop-on, hop-off tour (different routes available) if you want to see the city in a short period of time. Approach one of the guys at the tour booth for other tour recommendations based on your length of stay.",thelastmuse

You wont find a good rate. If you purchase something at Kodak theater, but if you purchase something parking can be about $2 for 2 hours. Just go to the customer servie desk and get a ticket.

40,Interesting and worthwhile,"My boyfriend and I took a tour of the Kodak Theater. It was a little pricey but we actually managed to get a discount by going to the website and getting a $3 coupon (per person). Instead of paying $15 we paid $12 each. I didn't have a printer to print the coupon so I just told the person at the booth this and we were still given the discount even without the coupon in hand. The tour was only 1/2 hour, pretty short. And honestly, I didn't find the inside that remarkable compared to other theaters I've been in, but it's the history and stories behind who's been there that makes it worthwhile. We did not get to go on the stage as another reviewer did, however. You are not allowed to take photos inside the theater.",Alice3913

30,Could Have Been Better,"The tour only lasts about 30-40 minutes and while it does take you inside the auditorium and one of the bars (where you can see an Oscar statuette), thats about it. I was hoping for a glimpse of the backstage area or dressing rooms. Perhaps this was not possible as they were getting ready for the new Cirque du Soleil show. However, our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. Tip: ticket is $15 but if you purchase it from the tourist information counter directly outside the theatre entrance on Hollywood Boulevard, you can get it for $12.",GourmetTravellers
30,Somewhat disappointing and overpriced,"The tour lasted 30 minutes. It consisted of the lobby, a VIP bar, and a seat in the mezzanine level of the theater. Because of the Cirque du Soleil we were not able to go to the main floor or stage. Was disappointed with that. Since this event is in the theater for a year- future tours will result in the same format- basically not worth the $15 we paid- more worth $8. The guide was good and knew her stuff and answered questions. However, unless you are on a pass to multi-attractions- skip this tour.",John T
50,Best Cirque yet...awesome venue,"We've been to a few Cirque shows before...this was by far the best. The Kodak was a perfect place for this show...not a bad seat in the house. I would, however, suggest Box 1 or 4 in the front row. We brought our 7 year old daughter who loved it!!! Anyway, it was very good and we would go back again...",Chukkerman
30,Not what I expected ... quite a dump,"Considering this is where all of the famous stars are seen on the red carpet I thought it was very drab. The outside of this place is dumpy looking ... you would think Hollywood would be neat, tidy & clean, but this place was dirty looking. I mean it was neat to see and experience and I get that things are older in Hollywood, but the camera definitely know how to make it look all glamorous. Don't expect it to be all glitz and glam ... just take in the history and appreciate all of the events that have occurred here.",lindzngreg
30,"Iris by Cirque du Soleil- a mish-mosh show, def not worth paying the $$ for the tix!","Unfortunately this show was a total hodge podge and not anywhere near up to Cirque's best. Take your money and go see their ""Beatles Show"" LOVE in Vegas. THAT was worth every penny - and we've seen it twice!",zdoctorsin
40,Experience Kodak like a celeb - new Cirque de Soleil show IRIS,"We went to the opening weekend of the new Cirque show - IRIS at the Kodak Theater. The Academy Awards and American Idol are filmed there. Needless to say it was cool to be in the theater experiencing some of the things that a celeb would experience (like...yes you use the same bathroom as Angelina Jolie :). The theater itself is nice, smaller than I anticipated. (The American Idol wide angle camera shot always made it look more grand.) Due to the horrible Hollywood traffic, we got there 5 mintues after the show starts (they do start on time at 8pm). We got the $70 tickets and the seats were just ok. We've been to several Cirque show including the Cirque tent, I have to say the seats at the Kodak theater don't really give everyone a good viewing angle. The show itself was a bit of a let down. IRIS is about the journey of movie making. The music was so-so and the story was too literal. For example, the actors speak and interact with the audience in English and say cheesy stuff like ""isn't it great to be in the Kodak Theater?"" To me, the beauty of Cirque show is that it's transcultural -they can tell stories, reach the audience without a common language (they make up a language). Oh well, this is Hollywood after all and they are obligated to entertain. Highlights were the Twins (opening act), the acrobatic sisters. You pay for the experience at Kodak but it's inferior to other Cirque show. One interesting thing is that the orchestra is split up in 6, 7 boxes next to the stage. I guess they rely on ear buds to hear one another and have to really pay attention to the act. The show doesn't officially open til Sept. You can tell that they are still breaking in when the music and action aren't in sync, or staff gave us the wrong directions etc. We also pre-paid Parking at the Highland parking garage (self park). They reserve parking spots for pre-paid customers ($12) which saves you from going in circles I guess. The Highland parking garage did have a lot of people directing traffic. Valet is $15-20 but we didn't want to have to wait for a long time. TIP: After the show grab dessert as the Crepes store. Or go clubbing or grab a bite. The theater is connected to the Rennasiance hotel, shops, restaurants, Bowling alley and night clubs etc. We had Crepes and it's a great spot for people watching and to admire the plague -where they set up the red carpet on Academy night. The Cirque Show was 2 hours long plus 20 mins of intermission.",CaliforniaChopsticks

50,"Cirque du Soleil, Iris","Seems I'm the first to review this.This is the newest addition to Cirque du Soleil. Iris opened on the 21st July and is based on a movie theme which is very fitting for the location. The performances themselves were absolutely stunning and I was surprised at the duration, 2hrs 20mins including a 20 minute interval. I've never been to another cirque performance that was over 1hr 30.Iris is superb and well worth a visit if your in LA.",Mark P
40,Great for people who care about this sort of thing,"I didn't know anything about the academy awards when I came here, but it was a low-priced tour that contained a lot of good information. I was a little bored because I don't frankly care about all of that (I was on a pre-planned school trip) but anyone who had interest in the Oscars would absolutely love it. My tour guide was good too, as she wasn't at all the stereotypical obnoxious overdone tour guide, but experienced and genuine.",Rose H
40,Insightful Tour of the Home of the Oscars,"We had an excellent tour guide for our tour of the Kodak Theatre which certainly enhanced the whole experience. Unfortunately due to the construction of the new Cirque set we couldn't see a great deal of the theatre, however the tour as a whole was definitely worthwhile; it was fascinating to learn about the Awards themselves. Overall the tour was enjoyable and the perfect length considering all the attractions in Hollywood.",SydneyTravelBug3
40,It's where they have the Oscars - The center of Hollywood Moviedom,"The Kodak Theater on the same block on Hollywood Blvd. as Grauman's Chinese Theater, the El Capitan Theater, the former Masonic Hall where Jimmy Kimmel's show is taped as well as the Hard Rock Cafe and the Hollywood and Highland Mall Complex. Of course, the Hollywood Stars are on the sidewalk as well.As you enter the building, you see the red carpeted stairs that lead up to the theater with the names of Best Picture Oscar Winner listed on posts alongsidethe stairs.They offer tours of the theater,There is a large underground parking complex that makes it easy to get in and out.",ct-cruisers
20,Don't try the Kodak Theater guided tour until mid-2011!!!,"We visited LA several times, and last time (in April 2010) we decided to try this tour, since we saw that it had so good reviews on tripadvisor and also we thought that it will be fun and interesting to see the actual place were the Oscars are awarded every year.But this tour turned out to be a total disappointment! We could not see anything from the theater hall, because EVERYTHING WAS COVERED WITH PLASTIC FOIL!!!We were aware of the fact that the Kodak Theatre was under going renovation for a new Cirque du Soleil show, that will open in 2011. They told us (when we bought the tickets) that we should expect to encounter some dust or construction noise; but nobody told us about the fact that we will see nothing from the hall/stage. We couldn't even realize how big the stage was. Everything was covered with plastic foil.There is a note on the theater's website regarding the renovations, but this is very misleading. You see a picture with a group of people sitting in those seats and you expect to do the same thing in your tour.When the tour ended the guide gave us a postcard with the image of the theater before renovations; we found this to be a little ironic.In conclusion, I do not say this attraction should be ignored; I only say that right now (until the renovations are not done), this guided tour is not worth the time or money. And I could also add the fact that the information provided on the www.kodaktheatre.com is misleading.",Claudia C
40,"If You Love The Academy Awards, Stop Here","If you love the Oscars, a visit to the Kodak Theater is a must. From the outside, it simply looks like a movie theater in an outdoor mall. It may be somewhat disappointing. However, the tour gives you a better understanding of how they transform the space (inside and out) into the glamorous event held there. My $15 adult pass included a 30 minute tour of the lobby, VIP lounge, backstage areas, stage, and theater house. If you’ve been to many theaters, it’s like any other. However, the guide was able to share information concerning the Academy Awards that made the tour enjoyable. I felt it was overpriced, but I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this award ceremony.Our guide also shared with us that Cirque du Soleil has signed a ten year agreement with the Kodak Theater. This may effect the availability of the tour. Also, they don’t give tours within the preceding weeks to the Academy Awards. I would recommend checking beforehand if you greatly interested in visiting.",DaDancingTraveler
40,nice and short tour,Overall I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting in LA for a few days. It's interesting to learn more about the Academy Awards and to stand on the stage where all the stars get their Oscars. Our tour guide was very nice and knowledgable. The only negative is the tour is a bit overpriced; $15 for 30 minutes.,Nadia G

50,"The ""Oscar"" theater","A must see for L.A./Hollywood. A tour of this theater is fun and enjoyable and allows the visitor to go in and sit in the same seats you see in the Oscar presentations. It is one of those ""iconic"" sites that keeps popping up on the T.V. giving the visitor a chance to say,""I was there!"" Go. Enjoy. Have some fun. Build some memories.",MarcoMolo
40,Nice place to see,This place looks smaller in the inside than you would think. It is hard to imagine that the academy awards are held in this theater. But anyway I thought it was very nice. They dont allow you to take pictures inside the theater. They offer a 30 minute tour every half hour or so. It is worth seeing. You can see a few pics of celebrities when they won their awards. And also there is a picture of celebrities on the red carpet.,turkey2009
50,Great guide,"This is a half-hour tour; it may sound short, but it is more than enough time to see the inside of a theater. It was fun to see the theater and to imagine it at Oscar time; I'm looking forward to watching the Academy Awards this year so I can pay closer attention to how the theater looks on TV. The tour goes into the lobby, the orchestra, and a side box of a theater. The guide gives a talk and answers questions; the tour is certainly worth doing if you are interested in Hollywood - and it gives you a little taste of the glamor that you won't get from walking around the somewhat seedy Hollywood Boulevard.I think the fact that we had a great guide is what elevated this from an above average to an excellent experience. Our guide (Matt?) was lively, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and funny, and we enjoyed the time spent in his company.",travelmore149362
40,Expensive but still worthwhile.,"This is a short tour of about 30 mins duration. Cost is $15 for adults and $10 for children. We did the tour with our three children aged 16, 13 and 11 and we all found it very interesting.Basically it's a behind the scenes tour about the Academy Awards ceremony held in the Theatre each year. Our guide Dominic was very informative and was able to give us plenty of background on what happens in the lead up to the awards presentation and on the big day itself. You get access to both the Theatre and VIP room and although expensive given the short time duration of the tour; it's worth doing if you're interested in movies generally and the Academy Awards in particular.",jogeba
40,The best part of Hollywood - VINO!,"Me and my wife did a mini ""Hollywood adventure"" right after the Christmas and had a wonderful time! This was a great idea to get away for a few days (especially when we needed some relaxation after the holydays). We stayed at the Renaissance hotel right in Hollywood. The only problem – rain and cold (not very typical for L.A. but with our luck……..) We did the Kodak Theater tour, which was great! We saw the whole Red Carpet path for Academy awards and the stage. My wife was pretty happy until it started raining. The only other highlight of our trip was the wine tasting right next to the Kodak Theater. The store is called Vino 100 and they are adjacent to the Kodak. Family owned (the nicest people!) and superb well-priced wines (which we thought was so unusual for a touristy place). Since the hotel was attached to the mall, we were there every night for wine tastings. The last day it was raining pretty hard so we took a bottle to our hotel room. Now the best part – we just found out Silvia is 2 weeks pregnant! Thank you Vino100!",hugh200
50,Stand on the Oscar world stage!,Imagine being inches away from the Oscar statue and standing on that world famous stage.We even sat at the same seat Clint Eastwood and Eddie Murphy sat in during the 2007 Academy awards!Priceless!,AVVToronto
20,Tour was overpriced but ok.,"On 4/18, I had attended an awards show at the theatre the evening before, so I decided to take the tour of the Kodak theatre. There weren't many people on the tour, just myself and a family of four...so you'd think the tour guide would be enthusiastic and friendlier. Instead, he acted jaded and bored by the whole thing, and seemed put out that we even asked questions or made comments. His standoffish attitude really spoiled it for me. I had mentioned one of my favorite celebrities who had performed there, and the guy completely blew it off. He did the same to another girl who asked about her favorite celebrity. I felt tht was bad manners to act that way because to a fan, it is important and he should've realized that.The building itself was impressive, but I don't think it was really worth $15 to see. So I would recommend going only if you are a serious movie buff or you've seen an event at the theatre itself. Otherwise, it will be somewhat dullish.",DesertRose15
