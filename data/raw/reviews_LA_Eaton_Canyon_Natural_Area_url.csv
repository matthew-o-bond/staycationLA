40,Great hiking,"If you want a challenge and see beautiful views, hike up the canyon and take the fire road all the way to the flats. There is a small museum up there and if it‚Äôs clear the view is wonderful. i have gone several times, once I hiked through the fog to come out above the cloud and see the sun. It is a 6 mile round trip! Be prepared. Enjoy.",KenPa24
50,Peaceful Getaway from Bustling City,"Eaton Canyon Falls is about a 25min drive from the Downtown, LA hustle and bustle.The trail is well marked and easy to follow. Along with a powerful waterfall, spring brings a bountiful bloom to the park, but winter doesn't stay behind. The cool weather shining sun, and the pleasant smell of wet earth, makes this a marvelous hiking experience!What to bring with you: water, snacks, hiking boots or any shoes will do BUT bring extra socks. It is very easy to accidentally dip a foot or two in water üòÇ",GaBee3
50,Wonderful retreat from the city,"Eaton Canyon is located on the north side of Pasadena not far from the location where the Rose Parade ends. It is truly an oasis in the midst of the asphalt jungle of the LA Basin. There is a fairly large parking area for the visitor's center. As you go up the canyon from the Visitor's Center, you can see some of the expensive houses along the west rim of the canyon. Go further up and the homes disappear and you are in the middle of relatively urban-free environment. At the of my visit (early October), there was no water flowing in the lower canyon. However, going further up into the canyon, a small stream appears. You follow the stream up the canyon, around bends in the topography. The trail crosses over from one side of the stream to the other and back and forth. You have to jump over the stream or walk over large rocks in the stream. It can get slippery, so you need to have proper hiking shoes and be careful not to fall or slip. Keep going and you will find the lower Eaton Canyon Waterfall. It is a beautiful sight with the water falling into the receiving pool. It's not a large or tall waterfall, but it is a rare sight in Southern California. You need to allow for a couple of hours to hike in and hike out.",geotech522
50,Great hike,"Always a great hike, been hiking Eaton Canyon for over 25 yrs now, love it especially after it rains",Lordswarrior
50,A nice break from the city.,"I can always use a break from the city or cities. Ten million people in the Los Angeles basin and you can climb above all that in one hour. You can sit on the flat by the parking area and take in the museum, walk the easy hike to the waterfall, or take all day and hike up to Mt. Wilson. I like going here and taking as much time as I have and hike up the old road as far as I can. Remember to take lots of water as it is always warm and usually sunny.",Robert L
50,awesome hiking experience,"we had a great time just connecting with nature and crossing all the small rivers before reaching the waterfall was fun ,. it was our first time we were not really prepared ,. but next time we will take snacks /lunch ,. so many little nice shaded areas to enjoy .",Blankita1980
10,My car got broken into here,The parking lot isn't safe here. My car got broken into in broad daylight on a busy afternoon. They broke the driver's side window. The girls at the nature center told me that this happens once a month.This place isn't safe to park in and obviously if this happens in the parking lot it is not safe to hike here.Eaton canyon needs to post appropriate signs. Horrible experience at this place and dealing with something like this is stressful. The staff were extremely unhelpful. I will never hike here again.,fashion12me
30,Pleasant Easy Trail,"Took the 3 mile round trip Eaton Canyon trail...pretty flat, shady in places, small rocks to walk around/climb, good feel of being inside a canyon with its natural state, but it was crowded and the visitors noisy, some even with music blaring...a pretty easy trail so it attracts a range of ages...lots of dogs...although suppose to be leashed, many were not...lots of horse poop...gotta wonder why dog owners need to clean up but horse riders get to leave a lot on the trail...pleasant enough, not great, but when you consider how close to LA and how easy, not bad. Nice visitor center with exhibits and restrooms.",PlatinumHoney

40,Nice walk to the waterfall,"This walk covers a variety of terrain; flat dirt path, climbing boulders, and walking through a dry riverbed. At the end is a small waterfall with a little pool of water; good for dogs but I rouldn‚Äôt recommend for people as it looked pretty dirty! Take water as it gets hot when you‚Äôre in the sun, but there is shade and trees in the later half of the walk.",Sherry L
50,Back to nature,"Great place to hike but wear hats and bring water, take the kids, visit nature center, good parking but fills up early on weekends. Gateway to Mt Wilson.",Jim V
50,Come for a moonlight walk,"Had a wonderful time at the moonlight walk with the volunteer guides! Lots of information, lovely stroll around the nature center to learn about the plants and ecology here, saw birds and bats and stars and planets, and had nice refreshments, too! Would love to come back again for a bigger hike and to spend more time at the nature center!",GoBlueTeacher
50,Great outdoor park,"Parking can be a challenge depending on the time of day. I recommend coming early. The park itself is clean and the trails are well defined, Its beautiful and you can walk for miles. Come and enjoy yourself and be sure to use the restroom at the foot of the trail before you start as the trails are very long here.",Ashley S
30,Not As Easy As People Think!,"My daughter and I were visiting Cali and read that Eaton Canyon would be a nice easy hike. We‚Äôre not avid hikers but we are in shape. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of young children and dogs who were hiking there as we started out so we thought no problem.Although the first part of the hike was ‚Äúeasy‚Äù the last half was challenging and somewhat dangerous in our opinion. There are many places you have to cross water by either going through the water or across slippery rocks or logs. My daughter actually fell and cut up her leg coming out and we saw two other people who were injured along the way. There were multiple kids crying too because they didn‚Äôt want to continue. When you get about 3/4 way to the falls you have the most difficult part left to go so be ready. We were all in at that point because we had gone that far but I have to say once we got to the falls we were not impressed and felt it was not worth the trek.If you‚Äôre going to go make sure you wear hiking shoes,take walking sticks, plenty of water and be ready to be challenged because it is not the easy hike many people make it out to be.",Melanie M
40,Attractive area for walking,"Great area for walking, bring your dog! Creek crossings (when it rains), picnic tables, great views of the San Gabriels.",DonaldYokum
20,Beautiful hike but too many dogs,Beautiful hike with my grand daughter but there was graffiti which took away from the beauty and too many dogs all over the place and barking which took away from the peacefulness.,Rochelle S

30,Not that impressed by the Visitor Centre,"Whilst we have written elsewhere about the joys of the trail walk, the visitor centre was a bit of a let down. Yes it was near closing at 4.40 in the afternoon (closes at 5) - but it did say ""open"".We went in looking for information - and there was not a soul around to ask.",BobandJosie
50,Hiking,"Eaton canyon is a favorite for hikers and all outdoor enthusiasts. Tis is a great place for fist timers or every weekend. Extremely busy on weekends, parking is free but had to get. Much better during week days. Bring plent of water on hot days.",pasadena4life
40,Excellent hiking,Eaton Canyon has numerous hiking trails. You can hike back the riverbed to a flowing waterfall and you can hike all the way to the top of the San Gabriel Mountains. You can take on his big or a little hike as you want. And the trails are easy.,PilotMichael
50,Lovely Place to Enjoy Nature,"Eaton Canyon is a perfect place to walk, hike and enjoy nature. And don't forget your binoculars - great birdwatching there, too!",Lynda O
50,STAY ON THE TRAILS!,"There is a beautiful water fall, and this is a great hike for those who are prepared: Hats, sun screen, sturdy shoes or sandals and lots of water, especially in the summer.BUT: DON'T GO OFF THE TRAILS! I live within ""shouting distance"" of the canyon and there are nearly weekly rescues of people who've wandered off the trail and gotten stuck -- or worse injured --and had to be rescued.Summer weekends are packed...you will literally need to wait in line to cross the stream.PLEASE: Pack out your junk. Don't leave empty water bottles, candy wrappers and soda cans behind you. This is a wonderful area, you can help keep it that way for others to enjoy.",Cindy A
50,Easy Hike with lots of Waterfalls,We went here on Mother's Day so naturally it was packed but we were still able to find parking in the overflow lot which was a 5min walk to the trail and free.The hike wasn't that long and took us 2hrs total and is good for intermediate hikes to enjoy. After you hit the 1st creek you're 20mins away from the big waterfall. There are many creeks so be prepared to get wet and cross the water and step on stones. There is also some climbing involved very little to get over to the other side.Overall enjoyable hike and easy to do! Super crowded on the weekends. Great spot for a lunch break or picnic at the top or along any of the creeks.,Ammara T
30,"go for the hiking, not the nature center","we visited this area with the idea of going on a nice hike, which did not disappoint. after hiking we decided to stop in a visit the nature center. ""what a dump"" is all we could think as we walked around the grounds. it looked exactly like a place that was dependent upon government funding, which had been cut under the new administration's guidelines. unkempt grounds, plants in dire need of pruning. we spent maybe 10 minutes walking around and then left. the place has a lot of potential, but it needs bodies to clean it up and put on a fresh face. sad to see.",joemontana16
30,Interesting Walk to the waterfall!,Interesting walk to the waterfall. Need to know where to start and be prepare to cross the creek 10-12 time and maybe get wet! But it worth it!! At the end- waterfall and small pool of clean cold water!!!,isvaysb
50,Hidden Water Fall,"A secret place out of the business of city life can be found in the park. As you go under the fire road bridge a small trail will take you between two canyon walls. As they grow closer together you will find the trail a little more difficult to navigate, but still quite safe. After about twenty minutes your ears will be treated to the sound of rushing water. Turning a corner you will come face to face with a waterfall that cascades into a clear pond. Noise from the city is drowned out and in this tranquil area formerly only known by locals you can rest and recharge.",Daniel H
50,Very cool hiking,"The hiking was quite nice. First half is a wide, dusty trail leading up to the canyon. But the second half is worth the trip. You cross a little stream 5 or 6 times, hike through a beautiful canyon trail and finish at a waterfall. Very well worth it. Only downside is it gets very crowded which dampened my experience some. Still enjoyed it though.",SKR944
50,Great for Nature lovers and hikers,Located just north of Pasadena near the San Gabriel mountains is Eaton Canyon. A beautiful nature center to Escape the hustle and bustle of modern civilization. Features well formed hiking trails culminating with a breathtaking waterfall at its end. Also features campgrounds and a fully staffed nature reserve and visitors center. Overall highly recommend for those who are adventurous and seeking something unique.,dmasu2005
50,"Well worth 2 hrs drive from San Diego, CA","We decided to drive 2 hrs from San Diego to Pasadena, CA to hike the Eaton Canyon waterfalls and we were not disappointed!Due to recent Southern California rains, the waterfalls and the creek came alive and boy it was very crowded at the trail leading to the waterfalls. We sometimes have to wait our turn to cross the creek and there were several of them. My wife outbalanced so she ended up in the water. Very scenic and easy 5 miles fun hike! Clean restroom at the Nature center. Best part is it's all free. You just need to get there before 8 am to get good parking spot otherwise you will end up parking in the overflow dirt parking area. Go now before falls and creek dries up again.Highly recommended. Just look at our photos!!!",lazvi01
40,Great trail that leads to waterfall,"As rookie hikers, it took us about 1hr and 15 min to make it to the fall. Mind you, the fall is not that enormous, but it is a very nice site. We found parking to be a challenge. There was an overflow parking area but the entrance can be easily passed if you blink. The trail itself was pretty smooth and easy, the last 1/3 mile or so was very rocky - make sure you have good shoes and steady balance. I would give 5 star rating were it not for the boom-boxes on the trail (who does that?). There were times when it felt like I was in a mall (translation: more than one person did this)... it was so noisey! Nonetheless, the scenery was beautiful and we enjoyed the outing.",Traveling with T
50,"Best Place for Local, Solo Hike!","I can travel here in 5-10 minutes, parking at times is a pain but there is usually parking at the second entrance further away from the Nature center Parking lot. I like that I can go here alone and there will be people nearby but not so crowded that I get annoyed by all the noise. There is a waterfall at the end that has actual water closer to spring than late summer. There is so much terrain to discover too and the Nature Center is a nice stop on days when I need a clean bathroom indoors!",Barbra B
50,Beautiful trails.,"My daughter and I took a Sunday afternoon hike. The canyon trail to the waterfall was awesome. It is an easy hike to the waterfall. There are a couple of different trails. The one that heads up around the mountain is a little challenging with the incline, but definitely manageable. The trail was a little crowded on a Sunday, but everyone was friendly and respectful.",robert m
50,"Nice easy trekking, both to the falls and up the trail to get a nice view of the City.","This is a nice quiet space, with arid surroundings but nice to get an early trekking. Our first day was to the falls, there is no much water to see just a small string of water, most of the walking is through a dried river bed but is very nice, coming back after the bridge we turned left up the hill till the third leg steep turn where a great view of the city can be reached. Find 3 small deers! Difficult to see, they are the same color as the grass.",julianjaramillob
50,Great hike for relative beginners,"This is one of my favorite hikes. It's short ... 3.5 to 4.0 miles, depending on where you park. It's very quirky ... if you're hiking in the winter or spring and the water is flowing, you have to cross a creek 9 times going to the falls, and returning the falls. It's SO much fun. The falls always has water. I've been there when water was pouring over the trail leading up to the falls, and when the pool at the bottom of the falls was disturbingly small. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE obey the rules ... Do NOT try to climb to the top of the falls. It's horribly dangerous, and a lot of people have died trying it ... Young, fit people. Plus, if you require rescue, they will make you pay for the rescue, and it can cost $20K to $30K. I've never seen rattlers there, but I never go off trail. I have seen deer cavorting several times when I've been there early. The gates to the parking area don't open until 7a. If you get there before then, you have to park on the road. I strongly recommend getting there early. It can get very crowded, and with novice hikers, who can make the creek crossings treacherous (I've had people stand on the opposite bank, blocking me, so I got stuck hopping from the last rock), plus they can be really noisy. I like my hikes PEACEFUL. Best hike I ever did there was on a rainy day ... Only saw three groups or hikers. The rocks were a little slippery getting across. Dogs are welcome, but leashes ARE REQUIRED. That's a rule you don't want to break, because there are rattlers and poison oak off trail. If your sog gets in poison oak, he'll be fine, but you won't be after you pet him. You can take some of the side trails up to Henninger Flats, but you will need to be in a little better shape than what is needed for the Eaton Canyon trail. There is a wonderful nature center at the trailhead, which makes it a wonderful hike to do with children, even if you don't go all the way to the falls.",Lee B
50,Nice Place!,"Very nice place to do a little hiking with the family, the way to the water fall takes about an hour, just be careful with your little ones since the last part of the road is very rocky. The waterfall is nice, but it's kind of sad to see due to the drought there is not that much water, but totally recommend this place.",NFA05
40,Serious Hiking,We set off not really knowing what to expect. We took plenty of water which is vital. Although the trail was good it is very dusty. It would appear it is 3.5 miles to the waterfall. We didn't actually make it when faced with a steep scramble up rocks and the thought of the long sun roasting walk back was too much. Only for the serious hiker.,Angela B
50,Beautiful place for hiking,"I live 10min away from the Canyon, it a beautiful to go alone, friends or family. Make to wear walking shoes and if you go to the Water fall take some sandals. take water. During the Summer go early because it get really ""HOT"" Stay on the Trails, you can easily get loss",MaritzaD_13
50,Great birding experience,I went to their birding hike. The hike was about 100 meters away from the parking lot! We did not have to walk for miles to see dozens of interesting bird species and listen to their songs. This opened my eyes to the fact that beautiful birds are all around us you just have to start seeing them and listen to them.,Art C
50,A natural area,"This is real life. You may see snakes, lizards, birds, pack rats, bob cats, deer. There are bear and coyote but mostly they keep away from people. There is a native plant garden, and a wilderness area. People like to hike here. It refreshes the soul.",Bj L
40,Worth the Visit,There is a nice 3 mile round trip hike that can be taken that takes you from flatland through a small creek to a beautiful waterfall.,aandmrun
50,Good Hike,"It is an eastern moderate hike (I'm obese so it's moderate for me, but for most ppl, it should be a very easy hike). One way to the water fall is about 2.25 miles if you park on site, so round trip is about 4.5 miles. Take water with you, because the water from the water fountain tends to be warm, especially during summer.Do not recommend strollers! The first part is fine, but the second part had many rocks and requires some climbing.California got really dry over recent years, so do not expect to see tuning stream on the side until you get close to the waterfall.Happy hiking!",Rachelle W
30,There is definitely a drought in California,"When you look at photos from 2011 of Eaton Canyon, you see these beautiful water falls and streams...and lush green scenery...Welcome to 2015...I have always wanted to come here, this was a bucket list check...The water fall is small...the streams are all dried up, and the green is more of a dried tan. I hope it rains in California to bring back to lushness of Southern California.",AmyFatimah
50,WONDERFUL GETAWAY,"Eaton Canyon, near Altadena, is a great getaway that's very close to the city. It's wonderful to visit it on the weekends, there are many trails that lead to a waterfall, or up into the mountains. I love hiking around here, it's really beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous. There's also a Nature Center and a Museum right next to the parking lot, both are worth visiting and there are clean bathrooms there. Parking can sometimes be a little tricky, especially on the weekend, but I've always been able to find a spot. Be aware that you can encounter rattle snakes, bunny rabbits, deer, etc. while hiking around the canyon, so always wear proper closed-in shoes. During rainy season, there's a ""river"" going thru the canyon. This place is very refreshing to visit.",Tina C
30,Cute but packed,This place was nice for being so close to the city so if you're looking for a nature walk and don't have time to drive far I would recommend this place. We went on a weekend and the main trail was crowded but the side trails were almost empty. There also wasn't a whole lot of shade but there were nice views and it wasn't a difficult walk to the falls. It was a nice walk but if you have the time to drive further out of the city I would suggest doing so.A quick warning: There is a lot of poison oak right off the trail so be careful!,LucyAbu
40,nice nature spot near city,This is a great place to go for and little walk or a longer hike. The natural area has good birding with a variety of terrains. A good spot leave the urban traffic behind.,sls58

40,Fantastic Hide away,"Nice out door adventure, we have hiked through many times, on our way up to Henniger Flats, but actually took time to explore the lower area, before climbing up the trail.

40,Easy walk in the park,"Eaton Canyon provides well established, wide trails for easy hiking. The last half mile to the waterfall will present challenges to those with mobility issues. There will be occasional scampering, and creek crossings via boulders. Otherwise an easy stroll through out the different seasons.",JackandResh
50,Best nature area,"We love Eaton Canyon and love taking our girls to the nature center. They not only learn about the local wildlife but can enjoy one of many hiking/walking trails. Plus after the rains, our daughters love to go and play in the river.",MrBalan
40,Nature & Waterfall,This nature area has many easy hikes. You start off at the visitor's center and stroll along half a dozen hiking routes. One leads up Eaton Canyon the a waterfall that is pretty impressive for Southern California. Some adventurous hikers continue up the side of a granite wall not realizing that coming back down is quite dangerous. Many have to be rescued at taxpayer expense. So skip that part and enjoy the lower falls only.,TerrywHamilton
40,Very good,"This is a great place to learn about nature, and also to experience it. It's great for walkers and hikers of all skill levels. Pretty sure it's in Altadena, not Pasadena.",CarmichaelVentura
40,Cool place just outside of the bustling city,"My son and I came here on a summer evening and had a nice walk to the ""falls."" Truth is, we couldn't actually find the falls... we think they were dried up? Either that, or the signage was terrible and didn't direct us properly? Not sure. We were there after the nature center was closed so could not ask. I think being there in the evening was a good choice because it was quite nice out... I can only imagine it would be very hot during the day! The trip to the falls takes about 30-45 minutes [depending on your pace] there and then 30-45 minutes back. Remember to bring water. We didn't but were okay; luckily it was cool out and we did not get stuck out there or something. I wish I had worn socks and tennis shoes rather than walking sandals since I got a lot of sand in my sandals. There was a notice posted that a mountain lion has been sighted in the area. Scary but exciting. Make sure to allow plenty of time before sundown to get there and back... we cut it just a tad close.",MichiganMelissa04
50,Wonderful park,"Great place to start off for a long hike or a short flat stroll with the kids. There is a lot of variety in the trails. The visitor center has great displays of native animals, some live some stiffed, as well as rocks and plants. The gift shop has a very good collection of books on related subjects too.",MySeaBiscuit13
20,I expected to learn more about native ecosystems than I got,"We visited Eaton Canyon Natural Area hoping to see and learn about vegetation native to the LA area. We had little time, so weren't able to hike far from the nature center. No staff were around the nature center during our mid-week mid-afternoon visit to give us guidance or answer questions. The indoor displays were not very insightful, brochures were not very helpful and the self-guiding interpretive trails were poorly marked. However, there were plenty of signs telling us what we could not do (Thank you LA County!). At least the admission and parking were free. Bottom line...it was free and easy to find, but not good value for our time, education-wise. It could be much better!The area seems to be popular with local visitors. We'd probably have enjoyed our visit more with more time to hike and explore or if we'd found someone knowledgeable to speak with. Unfortunately, our short-term visit felt like a waste of time. Hard to say if our experience was the norm for short-term visits from out-of-town or a result of bad timing.",65Rambler
40,Nice for families and children,Nice day spot for families and children. If you like the real outdoors I wouldn't recommend. Crowded and lots of kids. To escape the crowds you need at least a 10 to 12 mile hike destination.,KCCowgirlLosAngeles
50,Been here several times..,"Never the same place twice...easy free parking in lot.

Another canyon to the west, Millard Canyon, at the end of Chaney Trail Road, is much more pleasant. It offers a great view of the San Gabriel valley on the road in. Worth the time... say 3 hours.",Ross R
50,Never Disappoints,"Eaton Canyon is one of the places I would readily recommend to anyone who is looking for a birding place in Pasadena. It's very accessible in Pasadena traffic and parking is easy. The morning hikes are invigorating and the birds are always there. My husband and I were very happy to see the hermit thrush, acorn woodpecker, a very close view of the wren tit, golden crowned sparrow, spotted towhee, California quail, western blue bird, Anna's hummingbird and Northern mockingbird. The trails are very birder-friendly and not too arduous. Overall, a nice place to visit when in Pasadena.",Cynthia K
30,Not a wilderness area at all.,"Being new to Pasadena, I was looking for an easy hike on a warm day. So I found Eaton Canyon on google. Close and easy to get to. When we pulled into a full parking lot, I should have had a clue. We had to park in over flow, The trail was a wide dirt road, and packed with people coming and going. I'll cut to the waterfall, packed with people,graffiti marring the wilderness. We chowed down our lunch and got out of there. I'll never go back, it's just like the zoo only with people.",Km39
40,Nice Retreat...,"Love going here to get away from the craziness that is the SGV and L.A.

People attempt it but don't get far since it is scary and dangerous. People have died on this hike, but if you are experienced and do some rock climbing, and have no fear then the hidden trail is a great one. You get to hike up a canyon while walking in the middle of the river. It is refreshing for those hot spring and summer days. My favorite hike so far in Los Angeles.",NickMcNally

I've heard weekdays are better for the crowds.",Jessica A
50,A modest escape from the suburban sprawl with a nice little payoff at the end,"We showed up on Saturday morning to a packed parking lot, thankfully this did not translate into a busy hiking trail. We weren't the only ones out there, but we were early enough to not be encountering people every turn we made. We only hiked the trail that ended at Eaton Falls. This was a relatively easy hike with a few creek crossings. I would say any level of hiker would manage this with little to no issue. Its a short hike, around 3 miles to and from the waterfall. The trail does cross the creek several times so make sure you wear the proper footwear for this. The waterfall itself is actually quite beautiful and unexpected for Southern California. The waterfall and pool area were quite busy, but the number of people on the trail during our return trip to the parking lot had increased dramatically. I got the feeling that this trail could get quite busy at times. Dogs are welcome and many people had their canines with them. I think we'll be making this trail a regular hike, but I think we'll shoot for an even earlier time next time. The park is open from sunrise to sunset.",freekarma
40,Pretty good waterfall to be seen if you are up for the hike,Had a great time on this hike to the falls but there were a lot of other people there and their dogs. I went about 10am on a Sunday morning. I took breakfast up and had it below the falls. Would definatley go again for an ealier breakfast.,Duffywuffy
50,Creek crossing fun for all,"Perfect Sunday hike.there were lost of families, and pets (do keep them on a leash to avoid snake bites & pick up after them).You will be hoping over rocks and creeks so be careful when stepping on the slippery logs and rocks. At the end of the short hike there is a 50ft waterfall.DO: bring sunscreen; Hat; Snack; Camera; Waterproof baggies; drinking water; hiking boots or river shoes.*** a walking stick can help when crossing the creek***leave an extra pair of shoes and sock in the car.",viator805
