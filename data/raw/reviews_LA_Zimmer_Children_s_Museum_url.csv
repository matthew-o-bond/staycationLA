40,Great for toddlers and young kids,"Our daughter and I visited this museum while in LA and we definitely got our admissions worth! We had a Groupon for admission and she was just a few weeks shy of 2 years old so it was a great deal. There are two floors and most of the stuff is downstairs. Everything is very interactive and was great for climbing, jumping, and exploring. The airplane and water table were definitely her favorites. There are plenty of areas to explore and also art activities at designated times throughout the day. It was a bit crowded, but not so bad that we couldn’t have a turn to play with things. A few tips:- bring a lunch or snacks. There weren’t a lot of options in the immediate surrounding blocks and the place has a designated room where you can eat the food you bring in.- parking was nonexistent when we visited. I think they might usually have a parking lot but it was under construction so we parked in the neighborhood nearby and walked. I think the parking limit in the neighborhood is 2-3 hours max.- it’s a bit hard to find the place from the street. You enter into an office building and go through a small security check point and then the entrance is on the ground floor.- get your hands stamped. You can go home for a nap/break and then come back.Everyone on staff was very friendly and we definitely enjoyed our day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyp77
30,Not what I expected,"I walked away feeling like I missed a part of the museum. My 4 year old daughter enjoyed herself, but her favorite parts were the ball pit and the craft she made in the art room. They have some cool things here, but we spent an hour here and it was more than enough. Possibly would have been more enjoyable if she was younger, but I know we will not be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esami19
50,wonderful venue for children,"We took our grandchildren here and found this place to be fun and exciting .As you enter, there is a model plane that the kids can go in and pretend that they are pilots.. They have storytelling, arts and craft,,dress up costumes and a number of little areas that have a kitchen section, an ambulance to go inside of, an airplane, a little temple, a miniature wailing wall, a stage and an area for puppets.There is a room for you to bring your lunch and take a little time to just rest.My grandchildren are now 9 years old, and too old for the Zimmer now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop
40,Great family outing,"The Museum: Livingsocial has a deal now $15 for two adults and two children. It is a 2 stories museums. Ground floor and basement. Ground floor, pretty small space, not much stuffs for kids to play. Basement has a lot more interesting games, informative and educational. They even offer free art workshops. Need to check their calendar.There is a snack room so you can bring your own food and drinks to the museum. You can definitely spend hours there with your kids.The Parking: It doesn't have museum sign outside the parking lot. Sharing parking lot with Jewish Federation building. You will see security guards standing in front of the parking entrance. They designate a small parking area for museum. Free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Hidden Gem!,"This is a fairly small children's museum in the heart of LA. It's perfect for toddlers and kids under 8. This place is very hands on...kids get to explore and play doing everything they love like prettend to cook, play in a fire truck or ambulance, play with water features and airplanes, etc. Perfect when you want to escape the heat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel72
40,Great children's museum in LA,"Takes about 2 to 3 hours to see and has many fun activities for kids under 10 years old. It's kind of small but kids will have fun here. Parking in this area is a pain and hard to find, but museum staff is very nice. Some of the exhibits need to be updated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VY-September
30,1 hour of entertainment,"We went on a Friday morning around 10:30. It was not very crowded.I went with a 3.5 year old and a 10 month old. No strollers are allowed.My 3.5 year old was very entertained. He loved the water play areas, the boat/ball pit and the ambulance that is a real ambulance you can climb in and out of. He would have gladly stayed longer. I was done after about an hour. There is a room with tables and high chairs where you can bring your own snacks/lunch and eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraah143
30,Smaller than you might think,"This place is smaller than you might think, with only an activity or 2 for any particular aged child. My 3 year old grandchild spent most of her time in the ball pit. Also, unless you're in the area, it's a real pain to get to and park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveS42
30,Ages 2-5 Ideal,"We visited Zimmer Museum for the first time over the weekend as part of the Smithsonian's Free Museum Day program. At 1 year old, I think my son may be a little too small to enjoy this play area but I did find the concepts to be entertaining. He especially liked one small room that was full of soft playmats - perfect for my kid who likes to throw himself onto a beanbag chair or pile of pillows. Some other exhibits, the pretend cafe for example, were too advanced for him however, I did notice many other kids engaging there which I found to be so cute. We will come back here but perhaps once he is a little older.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodys_adventures
20,More cons than pros for this museum,"This place definitely has its pros and cons. My wife and I brought our three girls here,  ages 6, 5, and 2. All the girls seem to have had a fun time,  so I am giving a 2 star rating. For me, there were too many cons to bring the score any higher than that. Let's start with the pros...-all my girls had a fun time,  and that's what really matters in the end. -nice for smaller kids. lower level play area is simple. The girls kept themselves busy for a few hours, especially my 2 year old.  -inexpensive entry fee. We are members of the Association of Children's Museum Reciprocal Program through our membership at Skirball, and we thought the entrance was free. Upon entering,  the lady at the front desk said that it was only half off.-free secured outdoor parking.And the cons...-no signage in front of the building indicating that Zimmers is inside. Passed the building the first time around. -supposed to be a museum (it's in the title) but not one thing about this place screams museum. Not one interactive learning activity here. It's basically a play area for smaller kids. -the place is small and cramped. Pretend City in Irvine puts this place to shame. Stroller parking almost took up the whole area of the entrance. Lower level play area was jam packed with people.-My wife and I both thought it wasn't very clean. She thought the place was understaffed, but maybe the workers that were there just didn't clean enough. There were some workers picking up here and there, especially since toys get moved and dropped at every area.-no real supervision going on. Would have been nice if someone at least manned that boat and ball pit area, surprised I didn't see a kid jump and crack someone's skull open. Can't really see if a kid is submerged in the balls. -not sure if there was handicapped access to the lower level, didn't see an elevator anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tygerstile
40,It was more of a playground than a museum,"We went on the Free Museum day in L.A and good thing we went early because the line got big really quickly. It was more of a playground to me than museum. My kids had a lot of fun and that was the whole point. They have a ball pit which my kids loved, but they only let you play 5 minutes and you have to let other kids get in. It's cute, but I wouldn't have paid to get in. Sure it's multicultural and they have a wall where you write a message and stick in the wall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janet0728
50,The only children's museum in Los Angeles,"Take your kids and you will enjoy yourself as well, this is a museum with a message for the young and old. The staff are well trained and plentiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stylcounsel
50,Great I highly recommend,This place is fun for kids under 3 Thursdays is grandparents go In For free. It was fun and cute my toddler had a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christieo129
50,Children loves this museum.,"This is a small kid-friendly place with lots of educational play. There's water play tables and fun ball pit surrounding inflatable boat. There's alot of education surrounding Jewish culture which is interesting. There's a little pretend play bakery, shop, puppet theatre, library and also a cushion play area for just the under-two-year-olds. We bought a 10 visit pass for $50 which gave us 5 visits for my four yo and myself. Pretty worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelique009
20,Just ok if your kid hasn't hit 3 yet,"I took my four and a half year old here after reading the reviews about it being appropriate for preschool aged children.We were in there for 30 minutes before my son ran out of things to do. It may be that we went on a bad day because one of the few things they have to play with is a water table but the water table was broken and turned off. They also have a ball pit but it was so busy we had to stand in line for ten minutes to get five minutes of play time in the ball pit.The place is absolutely tiny. They have an ambulance you can get into and a plane but again, there were about 20 children in each of those because the place is so small with such limited things to do.If you've been to one of the true children's museums, like the Please Touch in Philly, Zimmer will shock you. They try to do the same thing as Please Touch but in 1/20th the space. So they have a supermarket where kids can pretend to shop just like the bigger museums but the supermarket space at the Zimmer is the size of a very small walk in closet packed with kids who can barely move around.Overall, it was a very unpleasant experience. I did see a bunch of 18 month to 2 year olds seeming to have a good time. So if you have very young children, then it may be ok. If your child is over 3, I definitely do NOT recommend this place.In fact, when we were leaving, my son said, ""mom, can we never come back here?"" This from a child who always wants to go back to any place we've ever been!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nayneem
40,Fun for a good price,We spent a couple hours in the afternoon here. I took my twins (almost 4) and infant with my 12yearold sister. The museum is small but fun. The kids had a blast but after an hour we'd seen and done it all so they did it again! They really did not want to leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trafficgal
50,Delightful Pre-School Playspace!,"Small in size, but big fun! That's how I'd describe the Zimmer, one of LA's hidden treasures. Two things to understand before you go. (1) This a museum strictly for the pre-school crowd. Older kids might find the activities too juvenile and/or be annoyed by the toddlers. (2) This is a jewel of a museum, i.e. it's NOT a destination attraction but more for locals or frequent visitors to the area.That said, it is a wonderful way to pass a few hours... or a whole morning or afternoon. There's a small ball pit, water table, pretend grocery store and restaurant... even a pretend synagogue! Our 17 month old child was enthralled for more than two hours and didn't want to leave.The staff is just wonderful... kind, welcoming, and really seem to enjoy kids. There's no cafe, but there is a snack room with vending machines and room for those who bring their own food. It's likely, however, that your kids will have so much fun, they won't stop to eat.Parents of crawlers will appreciate the V.I.B. (Very Important Baby) playroom, but the museum is best experienced by walkers.NOTE: The museum is sponsored by a Jewish family, so it is closed on Saturdays to respect the Sabbath.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pricelinetraveler
40,Very informative,"I had wanted to go to this museum for many years. I finally had a chance and went this month (October 2012). The parking is underground and a security guard has you open the back of the car (we had a SUV) before you are allowed in to park. The parking is free. The museum is not. It was $15.50 per person to get in. You also have to pass through security again and they open and inspected our handbag as well as had us unzip our cosmetic cases. The day we were there there were two Holocaust survivors speaking. We did not stay for the talk by the survivors. We toured museum only. There is a part were you enter through two doors at a specific time and then follow around through various exhibits which were either animated, had videos or photos. My only complaint was there was no sort of direction on what we were to do or where to go. Some exhibits were dark and ""came to life"" after waiting around awhile. There were plenty of opportunity to sit down (always appreciated in a museum). What we did see was very moving and extraordinarily emotional. Although I thought I knew quite about about this time period I was amazed by how much more there was to this period in history. I would recommend this tour as part of visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sadie4me
40,Just right for Pre-School age,"Went to museum with two (almost) 3 year olds, and they loved it.There are at least 12 hands-on exhibits downstairs in a loop, and a few upstairs including an airplane fuselage that they love to sit in and 'fly'2 of the favorites downstairs were the water tables, and the rubber raft that sits on a few feet of 'water' (plastic balls) that they can jump into and try to cover themselves with.Some fire department and nasa costumes were fun for them to wear, too.We had to have spent at least 2 hours here, but it might have been more.I just know that the kids were engaged at each exhibit and had to be coaxed/prodded to leave what they were playing with and move to the next thing.While certainly NOT an adult mind stimulating museum, if you are able to think and play on level with your kids, it's a decent way to pass some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pleibow
40,Great fun!,"The place turned out to be smaller than I anticipated. However, it is fun with great educational things for the kids. I was visiting from out of town so it would have helped if they had a cafeteria or somewhere for us to purchase snacks from. They have vistors leave the stroller upstairs right at the front desk - I did not like that because all the strollers were really crammed right at the front desk and where the staff offices are and I just prefer to have the stroller with me. Also, I came from Santa Monica so it was $40 taxi fare each way - certainly not worth that kind of money but if you are in the area or already have a car rental then you should plan on a 2 hour visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGabil
