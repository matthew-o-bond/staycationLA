50,Very good apartment complex,"For college students going to UCLA or for those wanting a quiet atmosphere. this location has it all; outdoor pool, miles of hiking trails as well as an activities centre. You may choose to live in the towers or have a condo home",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic815143
40,History!,"This place is amazing! To think of all the animals, and people that have been in this area for SOOOO many years, it bogles the mind! Go visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwy1
40,We walked around the museum,We didnâ€™t want to pay to go in. There is an plenty to see and read walking around outside. Very interesting to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themac3s
40,Really Cool Spot...Even for locals looking for something a bit different,"The ""big"" draw here is probably the Tar Pits, which makes a nice family trip, or date with your favorite nerd. It's off Wilshire, so getting something to eat in the mid-Wishire area, then strolling over is not a bad idea. What's fun is that active research is going on, as you visit, so you'll proabably see paleontologists and other researchers doing things in the pits, and surrounding them. You really get the scope and breadth of what we know, and what we are still learning about our natural past, and how it might relate to our future. You can't go wrong with this place. My one caveat is to bring a hat and sunscreen, since this part of the city gets quite hot, and since there's a lot of concrete and building materials surrounding the tar pits, being prepared, covered, and hydrated is a good idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybelle08
40,Looks nice,"I just walked around this, but I let my traveling friends no that this was a really nice place and right next to the LA Holocaust museum. Nice place to walk around, exercise, and was nicely maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arleneeberly
50,Saw a paleontologist working one of the pits!,"We only walked around the grounds and did not go into the museum. Walking around the grounds is free. You can pay to park at the museum or park on the streets, but be very careful with the parking signs as you can get towed on Wilshire if you park there at the wrong time. The tarpits look and smell like, you guessed it, tar pits. So not a pleasant place for a picnic, although we did see people picnicking. We were especially pleased to see a paleontologist and another worker working in one of the tarpits. Another worker explained what we were seeing and what they have found in the tarpits. Since excavations started, they have taken out several tons of fossils and we were told most of them are in the museum. When you go there, be sure to also walk up the stairs on top of the museum to look down at the lush garden and waterfall in the museum itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
40,Uniquely placed archaeological attraction,Of course the tar pits existed long before the city but I was intrigued by this on-going dig site in the heart of the LA metroplex. The tar pits are mere blocks from Wilshire Blvd and just a few miles from Rodeo Drive. The thousands of fossils the pits have yielded is staggering and the work continues today. The is a must see for the natural historian and paleontology students of all ages. The La Brea tar pits were on my top 4 sites to see in LA and I was not disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469MarkQ
40,Pretty interesting Place to visit,Definitely worth checking out. Very interesting and surprising that these pits actually exist...in the middle of the city! Very informative. Neat to see them bubbling. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the kids were only interested so long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnc763
30,Fun/historic stop,Park La Brea is an interesting stop while you are exploring the Los Angeles area. You might also learn something about the areas history while you are there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
30,Unexpected,We walked through the park after spending several hours in LACMA. Took a look at the museum from the rise outside but it was closed at that time. We tried a short cut through the huge La Brea housing complex across the road and found ourselves gated in. It was an interesting experience to see the houses on this 1940's project but grew increasingly frustrating as we couldn't find a way out! We made it just as night fell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lavarcham
40,Peaceful and Relaxing,You can walk right over from the Museum of Art. Nice trees and park to sit and unwind. We enjoyed the Tar Pit but will save that museum for another day. There's a line of food trucks across the street that are very good and give you a great variety. We'll get food there and eat at the park next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharon4554
40,Interesting,Visited this museum while on the area with the kids. Some great displays with interesting information for all ages. The grounds are also nice to walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleExpresso
50,One of a kind,"The La Brea Tar Pits are a treasure right in the heart of Los Angeles. Part of the original Spanish land grant, Rancho La Brea, the city now owns it and conducts digs there to this day.It is in Museum Row near Wilshire and Fairfax. Easy to reach and easy to walk about. LACMA is there as well as the Japanese Museum, Peterson Automotive Museum is not far away.If you walk past LACMA, you will know when you have arrived at the Tar Pits. First by the smell and then by all the oozing tar in the sidewalk and street. The main pit is at the entrance. It is fascinating to watch the gas bubbling up from the depth of the pit. Kids get a kick out of it. There are replicas of Mammoths and dire wolves at the edge of the pit.Years ago, there was no museum at the location. I have warm memories of talking our very young daughter to visit the pits and then letting her roll down the grassy hill they built up there in preparation for the building of the Page Museum.You really should visit the museum as you will then have a better idea of what went on there in ancient times. You may linger and watch the technicians working behind the glass-enclosed lab. Very interesting. You mind will be boggled by all the fossil bodies reconstructed and on display. All is very informative.There is a $12 parking fee, but we have never had trouble parking on the streets around the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oma664
40,"Free walk, $12 parking","If you walk to the park, it's free to see the various pits and active excavation sites. If you drive, the parking is $12 which is not outrageous. Lots of informative signs. Best part about he main pit is seeing the methane bubble up. Overall, it was near to see the active excavations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reingding13
50,Wonderful walk around the tar pits for free,"If you want to simply see the tar pits, the park is free to the public. The huge Lake Pit is fenced off as are several other areas where tar continues to seep up from the ground. All around are pits that are currently under excavation and some that have been closed. There is also a Pleistocene Garden. Restrooms are available and food trucks are readily available. Two hour paid parking at meters is $2 in quarters or a quarter for each 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grip652
50,Great park,"La Brea (the tar) Park is basically the ""entrance"" to the museum. But there is a lot to see there including real size models of elephants ""bathing"" in a (real) pond of water and tar, nice green areas, beautiful plants, etc.Don't mod the museum if you have enough time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRealGelatoGirl
50,Nice place for children,"We have been going lately because we play Pokemon Go, but even without playing it is a lovely place. You see lots of families with children. You have the Page museum and LACMA, they are worth visiting. I park on the outside when there is a meter, past 8 pm it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraiceC
50,Great park and Incredible Exhibits,"Not only is this great green space in the city but you have the museum of Art and the actual tar pits to walk around and see. While I did visit Both museums, it was the park and the mammoths I came to see. I remember them from my childhood in books and thought if ever get to LA, I need to visit.Let me say the free exhibits in the park almost make it unnecessary to go to the museum. It was great to see the pits with actual asphalt seeps and active methane bubbles. The smell was also very prevalent. It was interesting to learn how animals would have been trapped and how hard it was to get out. Still seeing an active lake with asphalt on the surface and still continuing to bubble with active methane was worth the visit. You could picture what it must have been like thousands of years ago, even if the portrait in the lake is a little inconsistent with actual findings. That was great how they explained it. Again I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
40,Do it all,"La Brea Park is great for walking and seeing the exhibits or basking in the sun on a lazy afternoon. The park is free but car parking is $12,00 and there is a cost for the museum but it has many things to see. Tar is still bubbling up in pools and there are a few life size replicas for the pre-historic animals . Nice walk to pit areas where the work is still going on, every summer scientists and students are digging thru Tar to pull out new fossils. It is amazing. Hard to believe they dug out as much as they and put it in crates then built a car park over the rest?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppynic
40,Lazy Day at the Park,"La Brea ParkVery open park. A lot of events spill over from the Los Angeles County Museum next door. Music echoes and serenades visitors, who enjoy walking and seeing the exhibits or basking in the sun on a lazy afternoon. Great place to throw down a blanket, find good food at one of the many food trucks, and enjoy a feast. A nap might result followed by more sight-seeing. Very highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
50,"Kids Love it, Active scientific research site","This a nice walk around just outside the museum. Too many tiny things to notice, Tar is still bubbling up in a tiny bits, kids loves to see stuck animals in tars ( couple of life size replicas) . Nice walk to pit areas where the work is still going on, every summer scientists and students are digging thru Tar to pull out new fossils. It is amazing.Some of the pits are already digged thru. Enjoy..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keks64
50,I love sciece.,A fascinating experience. We learned a lot about the LA basin. The park is a great introduction to the prehistory of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zdatny
40,I had no idea...lots of information on geological and archeological facts and factors,I was staying at the park la brea apartments (which have some great deals and walking distance of whole foods and the GROVE) and one of the many exits/entrances towards wilshire led me to the park with the museum and I was pleasantly surprised to discover this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldr645
40,"Cool, free, near other stuff to do",The park is free. Museum isn't. Deeper in the park is an actively explored pit. Docent gives great info. The museum labels which pit something came from and I think they're around 100 now. Nearby art and car museums make this a nice area to visit for several hours of things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,The Tar Pits!,"An amazing quagmire of history right on Wilshire! It was once the source of the tar the city used to coat it's streets. Mastodon, dire wolf, sabretooth tiger and all sorts of bones have been fished out of it and are on display...take your kids...they'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
40,Hidden Park behind LACMA ...,"Park LaBrea is a quite charming green space located between the Page / Tar Pit Museum area, the commons and LACMA ( LA Co. museum of Art). As such you actually enter it when you park behind the Page. Keep walking and you'll see statutes of prehistoric animals from the Tar Pits, ongoing excavation areas for fossils, rear of LACMA. You can even enter LACMA by going this way & it's quite pastoral & pretty. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Not a huge area - but fascinating,"I have been to LA twice before and promised myself that I would see this place each time. This time I made it and I regret not seeing it before ! Whilst the museum is small, the shows and grounds are fascinating. Seeing the skeletons reconstructed of all the animals found is fantastic. Don't miss the opportunity of feeling how the tar actually feels. It's a small practical demonstration that really brings home how they were trapped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felikso
40,Interesting and free (park only),"You can stroll around the park around surrounding the La Brea Tar Pits Museum for free. It adjoins the LACMA grounds and you will be able to walk past the large pit out of the front which has been there for around 40,000 years, where all the poor animals (some of them prehistoric) got trapped. The museum itself, within the park, does have an entry fee, but is very fascinating and worthwhile, as you can see the scientists working on new discoveries from the pits, amongst other things. There are a number of pits being actively excavated and new discoveries still being found. You can view this out the back of the museum (once again, in the free park area) and if you are lucky, you may stumble across a free talk by one of the scientists. It is fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,Nice walk before or after LACMA,"We visited La Brea Park after visiting the LACMA and it was a nice experience. We walked following the stablished route and saw the tarpits and the fossils. The weather was a bit hot, so we did the tour fast. It's a nice place to know more about dinosours and early life in the planet.P.S. Bring an umbrella on the sunny days. It will make a huge difference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarianoN_11
40,La Brea Tar Pits Nice Stroll on way to LACMA,"You can be sure to spot a bunch of people doing yoga right next to a bubbling geyser of tar just about anywhere in the park. It's a neat walk and interesting place to visit, especially if you are bringing the ninos and ninas. It's right next to the LACMA so you can stroll through the park at no cost. It's worth your time and it's one of the only green spaces I came across during my stay. There are several tar pits you can stop by and look at. As they are always excavating there's a giant fenced off area full of mysterious skips with who knows what inside! The park was full of visitors on the weekend but I did notice they had events for the kiddies on some evenings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vee33Mag
50,Volcano movie moment in real life,"Im a bit of a movie buff and have always wanted to see the La Brea Tar Pits after watching Volcano starring Tommie Lee Jones. Because im a dork i loved it and found it fascinating though its legit just that big pit. But they do have smaller pits with info on the grounds that you can stroll to. In addition there is a museum, but i didnt venture into.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spartigus15
40,Sticky gooey tar!!!,"There is an outdoor free to visit park which has the tar pits- with details on how they occurred. We paid to go to the museum- a ton of interesting displays, models, and lots of bones!!!! The museum staff were v approachable and keen to chat! There was a neat section where you can see people working on the found bones... Great for the imagination!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachTui
50,Excellent place to take kids of any age! The museum is awesome to spend some time in.,"To look this place up see Hancock Park La Brea - Learn about dinosaurs, and other creatures that lived a long time ago, but it's neat how these pits were formed and how long ago! Although you expect to see the wooly mammoth, dire wolves, sabre tooth....a lot of recent mammals have also been trapped therel.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xenagirl49
50,Fossils and history in the middle of LA,What a cool place in the middle of the city. The tar pits are an ongoing dig site where Saber tooth tigers and other prehistoric animals are fossilized in the tar. The 'ASK ME' man at the pits was fill of interesting information including the reason the tar forms below the surface. Further in the park are the current dig site and one for demonstration. Incredibly interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janicepk
20,Kinda underwhelming,"The mud like ""tar"" is just in the park, you do not need to purchase a ticket to view this. Ticket covers entrance into the museum which was ok,, but I wouldn't have gone in had I known.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arwrtawel
50,Tarring,The La Brea tar pits is free to see you and its in a vicinity where there are a lot of museums. There are elephant sculptures but the highlight are the bubbling tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
50,Fascinating,One of those places you don't here about in LA but for me put it in you must visit list. Close by is the motor museum which is also worth a visit but check opening hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVS79
30,Needs a little help...,"We took a group of students there this past week as part of our city tour. It was nice to have the chance to stretch our legs as well as using the restrooms there buy the place is very small and nothing to write home about. The tar pit kinda smell a little bad and I don't understand why there is three elephant sculpture in the tar pit either. Small park, decent bathrooms but not much to see...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
40,Fascinating,very interesting to see the La Brea Tarpits Does not take much time to go through it. great side trip. Also the park areas is very nice. noce family trip. the art Museum is also there which is a fun thing for all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraP0
30,Museum not worth it,The park is free and you get to see all the tar pits. We paid for the museum tour which was basically a large room with bones that were escavated. The museum took us 20 minutes to go through. Save your money and stay outdoors where it is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jher12
40,One of the best free sites in LA,"You can of course pay to go to the Page Museum and see all of the items excavated from the pits, but if you are on a budget and don't have the 13 bucks each (or whatever it is) then just go to the park! You can wander around and see the natural pits as well as some that are being excavated and have informational kiosks. The park is well kept and you can enjoy the fresh (ish) air and sunshine while seeing history! You will loop around to the LACMA (art) and there are some outside installations also for free! Also, there are food trucks along the street usually if you want to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikirol
30,It's small,"We arrived at the park after the museums nearby were closed. We wandered around enjoying the view and seeing the tar pits. There isn't much to do in the park itself. Many people were using the park to walk their dogs. I think it's a must do item and there is probably things to see in the two museums in the park, but do not expect to do much if you aren't going inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmanuel954
30,Fun for a little bit,"We stopped by here, not enough time to go into the Page Museum, but wanting to see the tar pits. We were able to wander around for a good 20/30 minutes, saw several excavation sites, and enough description that we felt we had seen enough of the Tar pits by wandering around the park.Kids had fun running around - nice that it is entirely enclosed by fences - no chance of kids running out into the surrounding streets. Tar Pits very underwhelming, not exactly sure what we were expecting. The big statues of ice age animals was entertaining for the kids for a few minutes.Not sure I would rush back, maybe it would be more meaningful it we were able to have gone into the museum. As a park, this was pretty nice, lots of people with dogs running around. Very clean, well-kept. Watch your step - did seem that there were a few tar bubbles here & there, but well marked with cones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heybets30
20,"I didn't like it when I came as a child, or now returning as an adult","I love science and history and like LACMA for the most part but this has always been a bore to me.I do get the aspect of it being actual tar pits that they got actual bones out of, but even after seeing it time and time again it never gave me as much appeal as seeing it on the internet or in movies.It is educational, and I have seen guides explaining to groups of children on field trips, but otherwise you walk up to it yourself and read the panels of information.I would not recommend to come just for that but, I do recommend at least seeing it once on your way to LACMA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
40,Nice and clean,"The park is next to the LACMA museum, it's a really nice place and you'll recognise it from several movies. I was really tired to go to the la brea museum but i heard is really good specially if you have kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/majomaol
50,Great park and site,"This is a great park in general. Very clean with lovely grassy areas. In one section of the park, there are the tar pits. There are models of mastodons around the pit and getting stuck in the tar to model what it was like for animals millions of years ago. There is a placard that explains what happened in the tar pits. This is a great place to come on your won, with friends, and bring your children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
40,great for everyone,"A good activity to include all - the grandparents to the little ones. There is plenty of room to roam, a museum that will fulfill all the questions, several different tar pits to observe, a famous rock as a piece of art, and even a place for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebiBye
40,History buff,"I like history. All kinds. This place had a lot to be shared. The pits themselves are plenty interesting themselves, especially the one that allows a closer look into how they dug into it. The museum was nice. I liked the Rock Art and even had a nice lunch at the little restaurant. It is something that could be shared with the whole family, grandparents to little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D2902SDsteveb
40,Great park and Tar Pits too,"If you're visiting LA, you have to stop by the park and see the famous tar pits (still bubbling) as well as the park. When we were there several South American bands were performing. Great time, a small oasis in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimH_Tarheel
40,Something to see...but probably just once,"We went here as part of a tour of L.A. and it was quite an interesting stop. We took pics and watched the tar bubbling. I will warn you that definitely smelled horrible. It's not something I've ever seen before, but also isn't something I'd probably ever desire to return to. Nevertheless, I'm glad it was part of the tour and that I got to experience it. The size of the tar pits was not as big as I had imagined. It is literally a 5 minute stop unless you plan to go inside the museum and read all the history of the tar pits. Depends on how you want to spend your vacation time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
30,Not that much to see,"Went here as part of a tour. It was worth seeing, but I'm glad we didn't spend much time there. There isn't that much to see unless you are a real enthusiast and want to know more about the history/science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOM-C--LIVERPOOL
40,"Pretty cool, one of a kind","Nice park near downtown with some open spaces. Of course not as glamorous as a national park, but very unusual and interesting to check out. It's strange something like this exists in a big city. Something to see. The pits are still active with bubbles. Around the park they have areas fenced off where the tar is on the surface. Nice display of their diggings going on also. If you are curious to see firsthand an unusual area, I would check this out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353

40,If you love science and nature,The park always amazes me every time I go. They are always uncovering new site and assembling new sculptures in the park. It's always fun to see a new tar pit come to the surface. The museum is less than 15 a person. The landscaping is more than amazing. The flower are gorgeous. You can pay for parking or park on the street and walk in on the pedestrian entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassandras306

30,Not worth the hype,"We didn't have time to tour the Page Museum which was probably our mistake. The park area is pretty, and it cool to see the archaeologists working on the current excavation, but we certainly expected more from the hype of the tar pits. At least it was a nice day to spend with extended family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DB823
50,Take the time to go,"The LaBrea Tar Pits are the stuff of science fiction! This is a great stop, even if you don't go to the Page Museum. Just parking and viewing for 20 or 30 minutes is quite an experience. Better than fiction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSUmindy

40,Nice park for a quick visit,"The La Brea tar pits are an interesting phenomenon. There is a nice park and a museum by the pits. However, you can visit the park for free without visiting the museum, which is geared primary towards children.

There may be a parking fee at other times, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radx4
50,Family friendly,"This is a great park to relax, learn about history and enjoy peace in the midst of busy Los Angeles.

My son had a great time chasing the pigeons. There was a band playing next to the excavation area but we didn't stop to check it out. Parking is a bit limited, and it does smell like tar when you get closer to the pits, but I would definitely go back, and it is free.

40,More than just Tar Pits,We came to Park la Brea to check out the tar pits and the LACMA and found more than we expected. The grounds were manicured and there was good signage telling you where things were. There were statues of old pre historic creatures that were awesome for photo opportunities. We took advantage. There were open pits that you could walk into a room and view the excavation of below. They had information surrounding the walls and fun facts about the tar pits. The page museum is also located on the grounds. We didn't partake in this because there was plenty for us to see.

40,Nice place to stretch your legs,"What a great find, after driving Round in traffic looking at stars homes we needed some fresh air. The park is open and has lots of Tar pits which are very interesting to read about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandan77
40,Worth every penny!,"It's a free city park. We stopped here on a warm March day and very much enjoyed learning about what's been found and what they're doing to study it. Someone that likes to read every single word on every single sign could probably spend close to 3 hours there; we came and went in about half that. Parking will set you back $9 (cash only) on entry, and they return $2 to you on exit. So if the real cost for our visit was $7, I'd say it definitely was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoverFish
50,Loved the Tar Pits!,"This was such a nice break from touring around LA. The tar pits were fascinating, and the museum was very nice. I think I enjoyed this as much as my kids! It's amazing that this is right in the middle of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LexKymom50
50,Pretty Cool,"It is sort of amazing to see this in Los Angeles. Anyway, go early in the day to avoid crowds and try during the week if you can. The park is very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kuwells
30,Wrong address,Its actually at Hancock park off Wilshire blvd. The mark on the map is for the apartments rather than the park. We arrived pretty late and only saw the pits. The mammoth models were cool but we werent able to see the museum or excavation demonstration pit unfortunately.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tzzza15
40,"Smelly, Freaky, and Wonderful",When you realize how long the tar pits have been around - it's makes you realize what a blip in time we all are. Astounding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzysulli
50,Beautiful place,"The park, museum & grounds were just gorgeous. The tar pits are interesting to see. A must see on your trip to LA. Close by In n Out Burger, shopping, etc. Not out of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusyQinGA
40,Interesting,"I have read about the La Brea tarpits through the years, and it was interesting seeing them. There are life-size models of mammoths standing in the tarpit as you enter the park, and you can smell the asphalt from the pit. When you follow the trail, you can go to a viewing station where you can see some fossils being excavated from a pit. They are a bit hard to see. The rest of the grounds I explored were park areas with some sculptures of some of the different animals that have been found in the tarpits. I understand that the Page Museum at the tarpits is excellent, but was told that it would take about 1 1/2 hours (minimum), and with a packed agenda for the day, I didn't stay. Even so, I'm glad that I got to actually see one of the tarpits. Visiting the park is free. The Page Museum costs $12.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30
40,Loved the Pits!,"We went to the La Brea Tarpits on a Sunday afternoon to avoid the crowds. Very easy to get to, parking on site, but street parking was available less than two blocks away.The on-site museum is helpful if you want to purchase books and additional information about the Tarpits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetnneka
50,Facinating,Great weather to view the pits and then to see the museum. Staff answered any questions while giving interesting facts! Museum cost $7 but the pits are free to view. We were 20 min. before closing so we were able to go to the museum for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarWoodbury
50,Great place to live!,"Great place to live and close to everything -- The Grove, museums, restaurants and a fantastic public elementary school.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbalsz
