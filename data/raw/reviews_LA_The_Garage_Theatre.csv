50,Don't miss this exciting show!,"Don't miss the current production at the wonderful Garage Theatre: Extremities by William Mastrosimone. Fantastic direction, acting and design. Yes, it's a tough subject - violence against women - but this beautifully conceived and executed production takes the audience beneath the surface of the topic. It helps us to look past the horrifying statistics of everyday news and consider our response to violence. What if...? or What when...? This kind of close examination offers a way towards empowerment.",victoriakb
50,Intimate; unique; fun,"Very limited seating ... So come early. Guessing around 20 seats and once they fill ... Pillows on the floor ... But don't lean back because behind you is a screen and no wall (back support). The unique seating adds to the ambiance and the intimate experience. Saw the production: ""Darkside"" incorporating the dark side of the moon by pink floyd. No intermission. Cheap beer and wine (2 tecate beer for $5; Sierra Nevada $5). Production had 7 amateur actors playing multiple roles. Tickets were a bargain and you get a great show. Really enjoyed performance and after show actors were talking and spending time with patrons. Class act. Amazed how they utilized such a small space and provided such a great performance on a shoe string. Wow. Lots of parking too. A diamond in the rough. Must have passed their theatre hundreds of times and never noticed it. Will be back But will come Early for a good seat and a beer.",baaaaaaa
