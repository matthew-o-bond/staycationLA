40,Finally,"Having driven past the Channell Islands - out in the ocean not all that far from Highway 101, ny wife and I finally bought the tickets for all day excursion to the Islands and back. Saw lots of porposises, birds, and a few whales and saw the connection between them. A highlight was seeing the whale open its huge mouth at the surface. On the way back our boat carefully entered a sea cave in an adjoining island quite specatcular and thanks to excellent navigations skills we were able to go quite a ways in to the cave. Only disappointment was that there was not much to do on the Island if you didn't go on the recommended walk - left us with about an hour and half with not much to do exept explore the little settlement including restored school house on the island. But, glad I ""Finally"" made it to the islands. Glad to have done it.",Dave W
40,Mega pods of Dolphins and Pelicans,"We took a whale watch tour out of Ventura Harbor, and had an amazing time on the water. The common dolphins were the best part - the boat crew estimated that there were 2000 dolphins, and they were so close and interactive. The brown pelicans, flying around looking prehistoric, were also amazing. Definitely recommend getting out on the water when you visit the Channel Islands!",Perthenia
50,Dolphins and dolphins and dolphins.,Taking a boat ride through mega pods of dolphins (estimated 3500) can only be magical. We saw bottle nose dolphins and the common variety.,barkus1968
50,The Isle of Eden,"Extraordinary kayaking experience that pushed us out of our comfort zones - truly memorial. We kayaked with Channel Islands Adventure Company - their staff is professional, fun, and patient.",FergKen
50,A nice boat ride through a small part of it,"As we passed through the sanctuary, we saw a pod of dolphins who started to play in the wake of the boat and along side of it. When we were near one of the Channel Islands, we saw the giant kelp forest in the very clear water.",John M
50,Teeming with Sea Life,"The cold, isolated and protected waters around Channel Islands National Park, off the coast near Ventura, are well known for their abundance and diversity of life both below and above the surface. During our visit to the area in March, we had the opportunity to cruise the sanctuary and the surrounding waters on a wildlife sightseeing cruise operated by Island Packers, the official concessionaire of the National Park, and the experience was outstanding.Sailing on a sunny day with flat water, we looked forward to seeing birds, dolphins and with the hopes of seeing whales - we were not disappointed. We saw sea lions; numerous pelicans, cormorants and other seabirds; hundreds of dolphins, both Pacific white-sided and common, including a single pod of at least 300 common dolphins; however, the highlight were the humpback whales.While I have seen humpback whales a number of times, including the opportunity to witness bubble feeding at a distance in Alaska, I was not prepared for what we would see on this day. We were able to locate quite a few humpbacks by following dolphins to locations where birds were undergoing a feeding frenzy upon schools of small fish near the surface. Each time, humpback whales would join the feeding frenzy, and while the action started out rather slowly, we were able to witness several occasions where a humpback whale, very close to the boat, lunge fed; lunging up, through the school of fish, such that we could clearly see the whale’s head.Very happy to see such activity and whales up close, it got even better from here. We noticed a humpback whale swimming on its side, slapping its pectoral fin on the water repeatedly, seemingly splashing in a playful manner. After a while of doing this, the whale dove out of sight then to our surprise fully breached, not just once but several times. It is hard to describe the wonder of watching an intelligent animal the size of bus shoot out of the water, twist, and crash back with an enormous splash. After breaching several times, the whale started swimming on its side again, slapping the water with it long pectoral fin then repeated the repetitive breaching again.This will certainly be a day that nobody on the boat will soon forget, and while one cannot promise to see whales, much less a humpback whale breaching, during a cruise to these waters, chances are excellent that one will see hundreds of dolphins; many seabirds; and gray, humpback or blue whales depending upon the season.",Steve5863
50,Great place to visit before visiting Channel Islands!,We came and visited this sanctuary before we went out to the Channel Islands. I would recommend everyone do this! It has a really nice video to watch about the Islands. The Rangers who worked here were over the top excellent. They were so kind and full of love for the Channel Islands. They knew what they were talking about! They have some sea creatures/animals in the sanctuary that were fun to look at. They have a lot of touch and feel things for kids (and adults too!). The small gift shop was really fun too. It was really enjoyable visiting here and I am really looking forward to bringing my kids here in the future.,cecilyJ
50,Channel Islands National Park/Sanctuary,"First I have to say I went on a Saturday when families and kids were there, along with a number of field trips and tourists. This made for a bad decision on my part because I could not book a trip through the concession to the islands themselves. That said there was plenty to do near shore and on shore.I went to the visitor's center and to the observation tower. I also toured the center and the aquarium there. Its very informative and helps you understand the reasons why the Channel Islands are considered protected and the sanctuary area is necessary. I also walked the beach, the jetties and enjoyed the visit nonetheless. Next time I'm in the area I'll camp out on one of the islands, book passage and enjoy the Pacific side.There is no admission fee to the visitor's center or any of the areas surrounding it. Its kid friendly and worth a look if you're in Ventura, CA.Don't forget to stop by the Olivas Adobe House too which also does not charge a fee. That's on the way to the Visitor's Center and also worth a stop.There are many types of tours available, either around the islands, through the channel, or of the sanctuary, or for camping. You have to choose wisely.",N4595KRricharde
50,Day trip to the sanctuary,"You never know based on the swell report what kind of day it’s going to be out on the water. However when we got out there it was all white caps and we did not see any marine mammals. On this day even the dive boat found it too rough to do anything but go to scorpion Cove on Santa Cruz Island to do the diving, and the visibility did not look that great on this day either.",NationalParksTrails
50,Beautiful place to snorkle or kayak,Really pristine natural pacific. I always see dolphins on tje way out. A bit expensive if u have a large family but worth it especially if you dont live on the coast.,donetteb2017
50,Watch the Movie,Great place to visit before walking the harbor. Climb the tower to view the islands if it's a clear day or after the fog lifts. Make sure to take in the movie. It's well done and is narrated by Kevin Costner.,KP_travel_focus_shoot
50,"Lifetime visit, come, come again","Santa Rosa was our favorite between it & Anacapa Is. Watched its endemic Island Scrub Jay & the little Island foxes: very sweet. Hiking, Museum excellent N. Park experiences. On our 1st day tho, enroute to Anacapa, we loved the marine animals: Common Dolphins, Bottlenose Dolphins & a few Gray Whales. This was from on an Island Packers boat. We were amazed to see the dolphins leaping, twirling, seemingly following the boat. For a long time, dozens!!This trip was part of a Road Scholar group staying in lovely town of Ventura, 5 great days.",AbuelaBella
50,A Good Place for Information,We stopped by this facility to visit and obtain literature on the Channel Islands. The staff was excellent at providing helpful information about the Channel Islands and how to get to the islands.,kansas_traveler38815
50,Wildlife Mecca,We traveled through the marine sanctuary on the way to the Channel Islands National Park. On the trip we observed several pods of dolphins swimming along side the boat. We also saw a Blue Whale! There were a variety of sea birds along the way and on the island. We also saw Pelagic Crabs at the dock at Santa Cruz Island. The water is so clear it is easy to view the sea life. A must do experience for anyone who enjoys viewing wildlife.,Kiamom
50,America's hidden treasure,"The Channel Islands are hard to get to,nothing is there, and they are the most closely guarded secret of the National Park system.See California as it was YEARS ago.",J_and_W2013
50,Amazing sea life to be seen,"We passed through, both on the way, and when returning from Santa Cruz island. We had the opportunity to see amazing activity along the way. Along with many, many dolphins, we saw all kinds of sea birds.At one point we saw a feeding frenzy of dolphins, pelicans and other birds. The captain of the boat stopped so was could watch all the activity. There were dozens of dolphins leaping and ""shepherding"" the fish, while the pelicans took advantage of the fish being caroled toward the surface, dive-bombing into the water to feed. There were a few dolphins that swam very close to the boat, swimming at the surface and playing in the wake.We even caught site of a humpback whale as it crested the surface, and flipped it tail into a deep dive.It was amazing!",iamquestar
50,Spectacular Going and Seeing,"The ferry ride out featured whole schools of dolphins following us, and we passed several rafts of sea lions, floating together with their flippers linked. On the island, we came to the top of sheer cliffs and when we peeked over, on our hands and knees, we saw sea lions sunbathing on the beach far, far below.What a spectacular place in a spectacular setting. Don't miss it!",CHEB15
40,Very good visitor center in Ventura,"The visitor center is informational and educational with good interpretive and interactive displays. Really good for kids and adults, and the video is very good.",LSUTraveller
50,Channel Islands a hidden gem,"We took the island Packers shuttle to Santa Cruze Island where we hiked to Potato Harbor via Cavern point. We had plenty of time to do this hike and could have taken more time to stop and experience the scenery. The scenery was breathtaking! Even though the Channel Islands National Park is the least visited park, don't miss it! The Island Packer shuttle was uneventful, we got no special viewings of wildlife like some reviews mentioned,so that was disappointing.",missmartha
50,One of California's best kept secrets...,"Taking a boat out to The Channel Island is a must do for all nature lovers. From sea birds, sea lions, seals, dolphins, whales and other marine life to the rare Island foxes This is a must stop when you are in the area.",vail38
50,Isolated Galapagos-Like Environment is LA/SF close,"A Must-Do for anyone in the LA to San Fran corridor. I began at the Ventura Visitors center, watched the amazing video and then drove to Oxnard Marina and got a boat trip ""on standby"" The TA choices to review this marvel are frustrating as there is no CINP option.!The options to visit the islands or cruise around them are limited, so go online and reserve in advance from May to mid-October. There are NO services on the islands. Trekking-in for a day or to camp requires advance planning to pack it all in & out.But the boat ride around the islands with narrative was extremely informative and enjoyable. i have lived in So Cal for 25 years and never knew that this gem was only a few hours away.",Bchgrl9
