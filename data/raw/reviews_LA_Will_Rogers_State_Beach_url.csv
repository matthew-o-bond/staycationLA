50,Peace on the Beach,"The purpose of my visit was to calm down before my 6 1/2 hour drive back home to Northern CA. Seeing the ocean waves, watching the sea gulls and hearing happy sounds of people playing on the beach hit the spot. Glad I brought along my portable easel and acrylic paints to capture this peaceful place. Plenty of parking and gorgeous mountain views of the Pacific Palisades area. I even helped a sweet family who accidentally locked their keys in the car. Guess I was there for more reasons than one. Clean beach too. Highly recommended. Reasonable parking fees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Real_Liza614
50,Favorite Beach to visit in LA.,Have been taking my kids to this beach for years now. It’s far enough away from the pier and homes. We park where the cliffs are behind and the ocean is in front. It’s natural and relaxing. The traffic on weekends can get bad but if you go early in the morning it’s amazing every time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433lg
30,Nice beach with some quieter nooks,We stopped by the little nook across from the Malibu Getty. A bit off the beaten path but easy parking and quieter. Not a ton of beach to roam around though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCKaboom
50,Great beach to avoid the crowds,We avoided the Santa Monica Pier and beach crowds and drove to this beach about 10 minutes North. There were very few people there and the beach had all the amenities as expected. There were no restaurants or a kiosk to buy drinks and snacks. Parking is 15 USD for the day and is right on the beach. This was the most relaxing time for us in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debsi
50,"Great, quiet beach","Nice beach with all of the amenities of the others, but with less people. The beach is further north, making it perfect for a more private adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylanwbr
40,Nice beach,We went pretty late which meant it was quiet. Seems very clean etc would recommend. Has a small cafe which was closed. Also has toilets too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276samc
30,Enjoy the ocean,Will Rogers State Beach is a popular stop along Pacific Coast Highway for all kinds of beach activities and for just walking along the ocean front.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Serene and beautiful,"We went on a Wednesday and parking was $6 for the entire day. The beach was clean and quiet. There were restrooms on site as well as a small cafe. Beautiful views in all directions, we even saw a pod of orcas swimming near to the shore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98haleyj
30,Too hard to tell. Cold today,Visited today but the weather was not good. Cold and windy. Spent an hour here anyway. Fish and chips at the snack shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224douglasr
50,Highway 1 encroaches on the beach serenity,"Highway 1 encroaches on the beach serenity. Otherwise, a beautiful beach that is accessible by public transit. Often film crews are present. No guarantee. But it adds to the fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Great beach,"This is one of the less crowded beaches between Venice and Malibu and certainly one of the best. It's the Pacific as you imagined it, with level white sand and clear views to the horizon. Parking seems to be the issue with many visitors, but ignore them. Parking is nine bucks - this is California - but it puts you right on the beach, steps from the sand, while others are looking for free on-street parking and end up carrying tons of gear for several city blocks. Too much waster time and effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mesatraveler
40,Will Rogers State Beach,"I have never reviewed a beach before as it never occurred to me, but after going back to one of the beaches that I spent my childhood, I was very impressed on how things had changed. To begin with, there is now a much larger area for parking. Access is easy as entry is located at a major intersection with signals. Parking is paid and plentiful. Its not a far walk to the beach and one of the nice things is that there are bathrooms and a concession stand. There are manned life guard stations so there is plenty of supervision for small children. The beach is clean and well appointed with volleyball courts and open space to play Frisbee or kick around a soccer ball. If your looking for a nice beach with plenty of amenities then this would be a good beach to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reidfk
50,It's Southern California and It's the Pacific,"What really can go wrong with with sun and the ocean? Will Rogers State Beach offers not only those two elements but sand, restrooms, and outdoor showers. What you have to do is get there early in the day so you an avoid the traffic and find ample parking. If you sleep too late or dawdle deciding which bathing suit to wear, you may find some mighty heavy traffic. In that case, bring patience as well. Great beach@",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfessorCharles
40,"Easy access from parking lot, bathrooms, less crowded than nearby beaches","Came here specifically because there's only a very short walk from the parking lot to the beach--much easier when traveling with an infant and a toddler than some of the other beaches in the area.There are lifeguards, bathrooms, and nearby cafe.Like most of the LA area, the beach was a bit littered and there was an mentally unsound, but harmless homeless person on the beach--normal for the area, don't be alarmed. Still less crowded and cleaner than the beach near the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IMoveALot
40,Parking!,"We took a road trip up along the PCH and stopped at nearly all the beaches. The further north you travel, the more parking availability there is. However, this is one of the few beaches in the south where parking was ok. The beach and water were fine but nothing to gloat over. We saw a lot of people out and playing volleyball. Overall, it was a pleasant beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,Great beach to walk,"We walked Will Rogers State Beach and had an added surprise. While walking and watching the water, we saw dolphins jumping in and out of the water. An added bonus to a terrific beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee
50,"Less people, More beach","My wife and I drive to this beach three weekends per month and start our run at the very north end of the Santa Monica beach walk. we run from will rogers all the way to Venice beach and back for a total of about 10-12 miles. This is a beautiful run as there is lots of people watching, beautiful beach and lots of waves. Plus, at will rogers state beach there is usually a lot less people and so the beach feels much more personal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrostElement

Numerous sand volleyball courts and nets exist, and a long seaside bike/walking path to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elspode
50,"One of Highways 1's best Beaches, Volleyball Heaven","When you are in Southern Cali make certain to stop at Will Rogers State Beach. You can park at the Santa Monica Pier and walk north. its a great walk, or jog, or bike ride that will take you fairly close to Sunset Blvd. Some of the worlds best Volley Ball players started their careers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Bike Riding Fun!,Started our bike ride here and rode to Marina del Rey! So beautiful and such a fun day! Next bike ride we started in Torrance and rode all the way down to Will Rogers State Beach! Well worth it! Rode through Venice Beach and got a fruit smoothie and enjoyed the strange sights!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YancyFamily
40,Picnic at the beach,"This was the perfect beach to stop and have a picnic after a couple of hours of biking on the pathways. It was very quiet, few people, nice sand, bathroom facilities and clean. The scenery was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
40,Nice place to enjoy the beach!,"We wanted a good safe place to park and a nice beach to enjoy and this place fit the bill. It also has bathrooms and a place to buy snacks and cold drinks, so that's a plus. Parking was $18.00 so be prepared for that. I only wish they had umbrellas for rent but bring your own or a nice broad sun hat. Great beach, we really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyinbothell
50,"Beautiful beach, away from the crowds.","Definitively recommended, not as crowded as Santa Monica, or the major Malibu state beaches. Nice easy access parking lot. Facilities available with bathrooms, and showers (as of this last Labor day weekend they were working!). Parking felt a little pricey at $15 but it was worth it. We spent a wonderful day at this hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosVent
50,Beautiful Beach,"Had a wonderful beach day... Beach is clean, big, adequate parking. Had such a lovely day and can't wait to return as soon as possible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_VictoriaRob88
50,Long beach,This beach is huge. You need to buy a day parking pass for $9 even if you only want to stay a couple of hours. It is not so crowded although you need to walk quite a bit until you reach the shoreline. There is a small restaurant at the parking lot too - good food but a bit pricey. We paid over $50 for 2 burger and a kid menu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sancho5a
40,Great beach without the large crowds,"Took the family here on Saturday afternoon. Parking was $15, and we ventured to the lot north of the entrance. There was plenty of parking, so no problem finding a space. We got a nice close spot. It was just a short walk to the beach which was awesome. With three small kids and stuff the lug to the beach, it's nice not having a long walk. No long trek like you have at Santa Monica.The section of the beach we went to was pretty empty when we got there. It was like we had a whole section of the beach to ourself. Over time a few people trickled into our area but it definitely did not get over crowded.Will Rogers was very clean. No litter or trash anywhere. There were plenty of trash cans in the parking lot. The bathrooms were clean enough to my liking.There were decent sized waves coming in, which definitely increased in size as the day went on. There were only a small section of rocks as you went towards the ocean, which wasn't a huge deal. My 6 and 7 year olds had a ton of fun playing with the waves.Only con on our outting was a homeless dude that was cussing everyone out who was walking by him. He kept saying F* you over and over. We passed him on the way to the bathroom. He wasn't harming anyone, so whatever. But I just don't like my kids hearing that sort of language.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tygerstile
40,"Really Rocky, Still Beautiful","This beach is really lovely- very clean. Bathrooms are your typical beach bathroom type. Parking is very expensive, but you might be able to find street parking if you really try. I love the area because it is cute and has many small cafe/restaurants around. I haven't been to any of them, so I can't comment on their quality, but the ambiance is very relaxing and calm.One complaint- if you plan on going in the water, it gets pretty rocky. There is a big ""trench"" filled with rocks so if you like to go deeper than ankle-deep, prepare to step on lots of rocks. It's not impossible to get past (my friends and I went in twice despite it), but it made getting in and out of the water a bit of a hassle. Maybe consider bringing water shoes if you have sensitive feet. Once you get past it, the water is really nice and the sand is easy to stand on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAW5
40,NIce beach with easy access parking,"Nice clean beach with easy parking access, nice clean restrooms and wash station on grounds. Got a little cafe on site as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intoreality

But if you turn to temescal canyon road you can find a free parking both sides of the road. Also you can have access to the some hiking trails food trucks etc..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmLA
50,Seaside Sunset Spectacular,"Easy access to the beach from the city, this beach offers quiet shoreline strolling or busier areas with restaurants and attractions. Will Rogers State Beach is perfect for romantic walks, enjoying the sand and surf, relaxing and, of course, shooting sunset photos.So easy to find this long beach where historic highway U.S. Route 66 (aka Santa Monica Boulevard in this area of California) intersects the PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) then follows the shore northward to Pacific Palisades. At the Pacific Palisades northern end, the area is very low key with little or no restaurants or amenities. In Pacific Palisades, finding a perfect place is easy for your beach basket of goodies, umbrellas and towels. For strolling, try a romantic walk down this beach or the Santa Monica pier lined with benches for sitting and watching the waves and sunset. Fishermen, couples, parents with strollers walk the pier and relax in this beautiful seaside resort atmosphere.Metered parking is available at the Will Rogers Beach. Or if you don’t mind a little extra distance to the beach, you might try finding a parking place on a side street. Still, at $9 for daily parking, the metered parking is a deal. Clean restrooms are available, as are showers to rinse the sand. Very clean and well-maintained. Love this beach due to its location, easy vibe and the beautiful sunsets while strolling the pier or the sandy shores we prefer. Very highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
50,Great beach,"There are so many great beaches in CA. We went to this one because the others were so packed we couldn't find parking. This one was busy as well, but there was parking. We paid 9.00 to park. There are bathrooms here and showers. It is a clean beach and a nice place to take a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASLOV
50,The Calm in a Busy World,"I was pleasantly surprised how private this beach was in comparison to the surrounding area. Known as the ""Bay Watch Beach"". It did not disappoint. just north of the famous Santa Monica Pier, but yet a.... undisturbed beach. If you are looking for less people and noise this would be a great choice. It is walkable from Santa Monica Pier, just follow the beach or the walking trail. Very Peaceful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmrusin
50,Beautiful Place to Run in Ritzy LA,"I ran from Pacific Palisades to Santa Monica Pier and back this morning and I loved it! A paved and well maintained trail runs parallel to the beach with several restrooms and beach cafes along the route. I had a bit of a foggy morning weather-wise, but the temperature was just about perfect. You probably don't want to plan on a swim after your winter run as the sea is going to be pretty cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454janh

40,Local's Beach below Pacific Palisades ...,"Will Rogers Beach might as well be named Pacific Palisades Beach because it's just below the hillsides. Nice beach, favorite of locals, not too many tourists. Bath rooms. Pay parking. Can Can walk underneath PCH / Hwy. 1 to restaurants, none on beach. This is the beach for enjoying the sand & surf. Neat spot. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Beautiful Scenic Will Rogers State Beach,"We went to Will Rogers State Beach. The views of the Pacific Ocean is very nice Its a very good beach to sit and look at the ocean, go swimming, play volleyball, and so forth. We've been several times Today it was blue skies and a hot day at the beach,Will Rogers State Beach is named for Will Rogers who was a Hollywood Star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,Good alternative to Venice and Santa Monica beaches,"It's easy to get burned out trying to see all the sights while on vacation. I wanted to build some beach time into this trip as a way to get enforced rest.This beach was recommended because it's more for locals and lesser-known than Santa Monica and Venice beaches.This beach doesn't have the attractions of those others, but it also doesn't have the crowds and noise and bustle.The beach is clean and well patrolled with plenty of lifeguard stands. I also saw a lifeguard boat, police and Coast Guard helicopters go by in the three hours I spent.The sand is acceptable, with more stones and larger particles and almost no shells, but it's perfectly fine for walking or running along the surf.Parking is $9 a day. There are restrooms but no changing areas other than the toilet stalls. The showers are outside and adequate for rinsing off.I recommend visiting Santa Monica Beach and the Pier as a tourist site but for resting and swimming, Will Rogers may be more suitable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Analogkid1958
50,Beautiful Beach!,"Love this beach! Its beautifully scenic and never too crowded. In the summer, parking is $9.00 for all day. The rest of the year it's $6.00. There are life guards in the summer time. The bathrooms are clean, There is a playground and there are volleyball nets too. Its near Gladstone's for fish on Pacific Coast Highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candyr739
40,Nice location,"This is a nice location especially when you have children. It's between Santa Monica and Malibu. I like it because I never have a problem with parking (although it's $9). There is a snack bar, restrooms, and outdoor showers right there by parking which is convenient. Also the distance between the parking and the water is pretty short so when you're lugging beach equipment, it's not too bad. Sand is soft enough, not that many shells for kids though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WORKMOM88
40,Another Great Pacific Ocean Beach,"Good surfing, plenty if paid parking. Lots of eating places bear by, very nice beach are the positives. The negative is the amazing amount of traffic whizzing around at 55+ mph. You don't walk anywhere around there..Driving from place to place a must. The positives outweigh the negatives for most people. Usually great surfing. My recommendation is go during the week. You can plan on the weather being great 325 days a year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
10,"Disappointed,more vagrant's tents than boys on a gay beach","We drove specifically to find this gay beach.It is huge with lovely sand, as are most Californian beaches, but there were several tents and vagrants sleeping rough. Whilst this is a common site in most if the cities we have visited this year,this is the first time we have seen such on a beach. We packed up and moved along the cost to the mixed beach at Malibu and had a great afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMLDJ
40,Pleasant stroll after Sunday brunch,Our brunch destination was Gladstone's. We took the scenic route from our hotel near Westwood Village and drove via Sunset Blvd. Voila! The road ends at the beach and the restaurant. We enjoyed a nice (but expensive) brunch with beautiful views of the ocean. Then we took off our shoes and strolled up and down the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KriksPicks
40,Nice beach to visit in LA,"When in LA, I don't really like driving too far just to get to a beach. Came here in September, weather was still in the 80s and sunny skies every day. I guess I was fairly lucky as I came during the weekday and it was fairly quiet and really nice to be able to have the beach fairly empty and just enjoy some R&R. It may not be the nicest of beaches in California, but it gets the job done as somewhere close enough that is nice enough. Parking right next to the beach is reasonable (about $9) if you park for the day, otherwise you could venture onto one of the side streets off PCH and try to find something there, but may be a bit difficult. Overall, would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatzbee
50,"Will Rogers, Will Be Good For U","I returned to Will Rogers Beach again this year and found it still to be a great place to hang out, swim and catch some rays. This time I went to the far end of the beach, almost to Pacific Palisaides and found free parking at the side of the road and a nice wooden stairway from the PCH down to the beach. There were some surfers there, but not much else going on, which is nice if you are looking for quiet. The main beach south of this end has a $9 entry fee which I saved on the two days I was at the beach. With the busy Pacific Coast Highway above there is little if any road noise to disturb the ocean sound. I had to go a bit north of the beach to turn around and come back to it from the north since I had come from the Santa Monica area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertocollins
50,Beautiful beach with plenty of paid parking and space,"Locals will tell you this beach is rarely crowded since it doesn't have all of the bars, etc. that a lot of the other stretches have. This was perfect for our family as it left plenty of room for building sandcastles and running. There are lifeguards and restrooms with showers...but unlike other reviewers our experience was not that they were the cleanest. The outdoor showers do come in handy for rinsing all of the sand off though. Beautiful spot for walks on the beach and saw several couples enjoying picnics while watching the perfect view of the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutha2s
50,Beautiful beach!,"I used to live just up Temescal from this beach so I really know this beach well. During the summer months, I used to come here at least 3 times a week. I've been coming back to this beach with my 12 year old daughter. We just park on Temescal and walk down to avoid the parking fees. We bring a cooler with drinks, sandwiches and snacks and make a whole day of it. Nice, clean bathrooms. Showers to rinse off the sand. Nice bike path that you can ride all the way to Venice Beach, there's so much to do here. You're also only about 10 minutes by bike to the Santa Monica Pier. My daughter likes to boogie board here during the summer months. The water quality is always an ""A"" on Heal the Bay website during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonK935
50,Plenty of Parking,"The entrance to the Beach is right off Temescal Canyon. I especially love this beach because of the almost 2 mile walking path before you even get to Chatauqua and the main bike path. If you turn right you have half a mile to the Bel Air Bay club, turn around and you have about a mile and a half to Chatauqua. You could walk all the way to the Pier( that's about 2.5 miles) so it would be 5 miles round trip to get back, I have walked to Venice Beach from here. But you have to share the path with the bicycles at this point. There are plenty of new super clean restrooms!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HilaryS931
40,Nice beach location with paid parking!,"Nice beach with beautiful views up the coast to Malibu and down the coast to Palos Verdes. Parking is generally plentiful, although costly ($12 on Summer weekends). Remote areas of the parking areas are good for rollerblading and connects to pave bike paths to Venice Beach and beyond! Beach is relatively narrow and can get crowded, but one kind-of expects that! Life guards and restroom facilities are plentiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonTraveller61
40,Great Beach! Great Location!,"This beach is somehow right in the middle of everything, but is never uncomfortably crowded. It's $12 to park, but some people find street parking and walk in. The beach is clean and the bathrooms are useable. I went out there to just sunbathe with a friend and we had a great time and couldn't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freejinn
50,Family friendly and clean,"This was such a family friendly beach! First, the bathrooms were nice for what you'd expect for a public bathroom, even had a bench/sitting area for changing. Bathrooms were easy to access and had the showers right outside which helped for rinsing sand off kids. The beach also had swing sets and mini climbing structures, which the kids loved too. Parking for the day was so easy. It was busy but had plenty of available spots. I would go back with the family anytime!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZMomto3
50,Great Beach - Clean Long- Surf,"This beach north of Santa Monica comes without the trash and the hubub or Santa Monica Beach and Pier. Yes, it has no pier, but if you are in to just chillin, sunnin, and surfin, with board or body, it is great. Entry per car is $9 and there is plenty of room for everyone. We tried our five beaches in Korea and then stopped in LA for a couple of days and this beach is right up there with Manhattan Beach in our estimation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertocollins
