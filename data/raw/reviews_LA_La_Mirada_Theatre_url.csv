The productions are not touring Broadway shows such as the Pantages in Hollywood, and not the caliber of the Geffen or Ahmanson, but the entertainment value provided by very talented actors is very good - at least a couple of rungs higher than community theater in a typical town. We had a wonderful time with ""Singing in the Rain"". The show was very well produced; cast with very fine talent; nice set pieces made for the show; experienced, capable direction - it surpassed all expectations.

The songs belted out by Angela Ingersoll are FANTASTIC, backed up by Jon Steinhagen on piano, who is fabulous, and a great bunch of musicians. As a Judy Garland fan and having met and spent a few private moments with Judy I what blown away by Angela's amazing recreation of an icon.
