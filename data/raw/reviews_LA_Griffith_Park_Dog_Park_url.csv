50,Better than Silverlake Dog Park,I've been bringing my pups here for 10 years and it's my number one choice of parks in the NELA area. This park has a very large play area for big dogs and it's fairly well shaded so humans can relax on hot days. As with most dog parks there are areas to sit but you take your chances with cleanliness. It's not as fancy as the La Crescenta park but it's much bigger and the people aren't as cliquish. It may be about the same size as Silverlake but easier to park and not as crowded. I've never had an issue trying to find parking and it's fairly easy to get in/out as long as there are no soccer games happening on the playing fields.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller
40,Accessible from entrance to Griffith Park,"This is part of the Griffith Park complex, next to soccer fields, and adjacent to bike path. Free parking in lot and on street, looks nice when I drive by to hike in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
