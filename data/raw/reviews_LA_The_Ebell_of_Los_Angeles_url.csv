50,The Classic Wedding of Our Dreams,"We had the perfect wedding at the Ebell.Wedding venues aren't easy to find in Los Angeles. We looked all over, from Malibu to Silverlake. And finally, we landed on the perfect venue, The Ebell Club of Los Angeles.First, a little about what we wanted. We wanted a historic venue. We wanted a beautiful venue. We wanted a venue with a number of spaces. Check. Check. Check.But then there are the things we didn't consider. The Ebell has wonderful in house catering. The Ebell has a massive parking lot. The Ebell runs like a well-oiled machine with an amazing staff. You will be assigned a personal venue coordinator who is on-call and you will receive quick and efficient updates.And the Ebell is a venue that you can admire. The history of the Ebell includes Amelia Earhart and Judy Garland, and to this day, the Ebell is a cornerstone of female civic culture in Los Angeles.Our wedding night went perfectly. Our 40s Hollywood theme was executed perfectly and the staff was a tee. The decor felt like a dream and so much of that was thanks to the venue that doesn't need much in terms of decoration to look amazing.In short, the Ebell is a dream venue that is also a part of LA history.If there is one note that we have it is that sometimes the organization of the Ebell is tough to keep up with. They adjust your billing with each request you make and sometimes, you'll lose track of the money on the margins. Just be sure to double check your invoices, as you may have agreed to something or you might have minimums that you weren't clear on.But, ultimately, this was the cost of having a wedding at a venue that is such a well-oiled machine. We would recommend the Ebell to anyone who wants to have the classic wedding of their dreams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendenmgallagher
40,Historic beauty,"I attended a one-day lecture series. The parking is convenient and building is beautiful. It's size more than accommodated a large audience. But, and it's a big but, there are only four lady toilets off the lobby and four more up a large stairway. Completely insufficient for over 300 guests. So there were long lines at every break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coco091
10,"Great Show, Beautiful Venue, Horrible Parking","I attended the 10th Annual Comedy celebration Honoring Pater Boyle's widow, with Ray Romano. Great show with many comedian stars, who made us laugh as we hadn't for years. Everything was fine until we headed out for our car. After paying 10 dollars for parking we found a line that was more than 2 blocks long and it took us more than 1 1/2 hours to get our car. The worst Valet Parking in Southern California. Great Show, Beautiful Venue, Horrible Parking. I won't come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luchoap
50,Best wedding venue ever,"I'm a veteran of (too) many weddings which seemed to last forever or suffered because the venue was inadequate: not enough seats for invitees to the ceremony, waiting to set up tables after the ceremony, bathrooms tiny/far away, no provision for sudden weather changes, no quiet spaces, etc. The Ebell was a wonderful change. It has an outside area that cascades downward, so the views are good from each row of seats. It has a very large inside room, and a smaller one as well, so each part of a wedding (ceremony, cocktails & appetizers, meal) can be set up in advance for a seamless transition. The inside/outside locations are connected by many doors, for easy flow & no traffic bottlenecks. A wedding can be shifted from outside to inside in a very short time if necessary. The staff was excellent, and the historic building is gorgeous, well-maintained, and impeccably clean. There are many smaller rooms on the second floor for childcare, etc.I wish all the weddings I go to in the future could be held here, and I don't live in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forb1
30,Nice albeit loud apor,This was a beautiful spot. I attended a wedding here. Unfortunately the acoustics were crazy so we could hear an entirely different event. But the interior was beautiful and a fun place for a wedding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelingbear1000
