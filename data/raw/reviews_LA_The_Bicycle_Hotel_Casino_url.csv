50,Lovely rooms and decor,We have stayed at this hotel 3 times now. The rooms are comfortable. The bathrooms are huge with a huge shower. There is a pool and excersize room on property and there is a great Sunday brunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanniemu
50,Las Vegas only Cleaner and Smoke Free,"Stayed at the Bicycle while visiting family in Long Beach. This hotel is so immaculate that you feel you could eat off the floors. The casino is organized, clean and very open floor plan. NO SMOKING!! The room was very large, with Keurig, fridge, etc. Large walk in shower. I paid $167 per night and it was a great value. Food at the brew pub was excellent. Not a family location, but a great adult get away. Only beef is that the bed was overly firm, but that's a personal preference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krismyoder
40,Good Poker Action,Plenty of cash games going. I arrived during a WPT tour event so daily tournaments were suspended. Nice dealers and floor bosses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jms574
50,Great Value,The Suites/Rooms are some of the best value in Southern California. This is a hidden gem. A great hotel for business travelers that probably gets under used because it attached to a casino. The food is average and you should be aware of the RESORT FEE.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wally9bbq
40,Value for money,"With a 4 star rating, this hotel could be the best you can experience in LA for a reasonable amount.The rooms are new and shiny, the bathroom big with a 2 person shower. Big new gym and well priced breakfast (10-12$) as well as reasonably priced restaurants is also big plusses. Get a room high up (3+) facing west and you can enjoy city and sunset views.Look for value deals which could get you a room for less than 150US$ per night. A 10$ resort fee is added per room per day, which includes valet parking (but there is also free self-parking for hotel guests at the closed lot).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip42739152757
10,I hate this place,"Welcome to the angriest casino on the west coast.Bathrooms are always filthy. The customers have all been thrown out of every other casino and this is the only place they have left to go. The tournament staff and dealers are the worst (aside from Mo).The asian food used to be good but the new kitchen stinks. This is the only place I know of, that I actually enjoyed leaving.I should add that the new hotel rooms are nice, but they are grossly overpriced!!!The booking option on here prices rooms at 200+ per night, or the Quality Inn across the street for 60.True, the Bike rooms are nicer, but if you only plan on sleeping there, go to Quality Inn. Trust me, I've been to every casino in the country (I'm not proud of it).The Bike is truly one of the worst, and definitely THE worst, west of the Rockies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112neils
50,Excellent Hotel,Bell Gardens does not have the best reputation so when I needed to stay in the area for one night on business I was not optimistic.Any expectations I may have had were well exceeded by the hotel. I stayed in one of the suites and it was actually better than the photos. In many hotels there have been recent renovations that look good in pictures but the actual quality of the furnishings is cheap. I did not feel that way here. The bathroom was legitimately lavish.The valet and check in process was very easy and I was in my room within 10 minutes of arriving.If you are looking for actual luxury accommodations in the area I would highly recommend this hotel especially for the price point. If you were trying to get the same level of room in down town or somewhere more trendy you would be looking at 4-5 hundred per night which is not what it cost to stay here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billy_Healy
40,Strong 4.5,"Amazing experience away from tourist attractions. Newly renovated and great amenities. Only wish they cleaned the bathroom a little bit deeper and they would be a 5 star. Great bang for your buck and would have no problem returning. Lots of Chinese elements here with bamboo and the ""Macau room"". I don't play poker but I would absolutely come here of I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwarren14work
50,Excellent place,I have enjoyed this hotel.It was a perfect place for us to stay in LA close to out points of interes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristianalind
40,Limited Menu - Great Hostess & Server,"Stopped for dinner after a long, hard day. This hotel/resort/casino was quite nice and very inexpensive. We really enjoyed our stay and the food. The cheese curd appetizer was very large and quite good. Not diet food. My wife's steak was a little tough, so they promptly replaced it and comped the meal. Service was attentive and unrushed. Waitress was very humorous and quite pleasant. In all, a good experience at a very fair price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D972BZdavidm
50,"Currently staying here, amazing!","My partner and I are on the 2nd of two nights at the Bicycle Hotel and Casino. We were offered complimentary valet service and a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The room is heavenly. The hotel provides free L'Occitane products, shampoo, conditioner etc, and they have replaced these when used. Haven't used the pool but looks of a good size and clean. You get a 15% off voucher for the in-house restaurant, food is okay and reasonably priced. You also get $25 per adult towards a 50 minute or more treatment in the spa. Hotel is located about half an hour drive from attractions in LA so not too bad if you drive and away from the hustle and bustle. Lots of amenities close by including restaurants and a large Walmart within a couple of miles. Brilliant stay here. The bed is soo comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alices699
40,weekend trip,Stayed here and everything was nice. The only issue was that I stayed on the 7th floor and I kept hearing a noise that would wake me up at night. It was like a banging noise. There was no phone on the table in the accessible room I was in so could not call front desk without getting out of bed.Casino does not have slot machines only table games. Area nice to walk around in. Applebee's and shopping within walking distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tam2930
50,Awesome!!,"We just check out of The Bicycle hotel and everything was perfect! The staff is so nice and professional, the place is so pretty looking, modern and very clean. The pictures do it no justice! We were surprised at how nice it is. Would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913paulinaa
30,"Nice enough hotel, far away from tourist attractions","We stayed at this hotel during our short trip to LA. The hotel and room was nice, reasonable standard for the price paid.The parking cost of $18 per day seemed unnecessary given that the hotel is far out of LA with a huge car park.The food was “ok” - typical bar food - burgers, nachos and the like.We wish we had researched the location more carefully as this was far out of the city and the traffic was horrendous. We were on the wrong side of everything really. We decided after one drive to Hollywood that the next day we would take the tram. The hotel is around a 15-minute Drive from the park and ride and this was really successful.I would recommend the hotel for anyone wanting to stay as a stop-off or for the casino but not a tourist visiting the LA attractions - too far out and the traffic is manic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenbatten24
40,Uncooperative staff,1.) Very poor staff.2.) Uncooperative staff.3.) Good security.4.) Good ambiance.5.) Good architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nitinsgtilin
40,"Nice room, but staff falls short","This place is the height of faux luxury. The rooms are quite nice, but there are some glaring inconsistencies and if they don't fix some of them it won't be nice for too much longer. For instance, there are no paper cups placed in the rooms, but I have had to return glasses to the front desk because they were absolutely filthy. In other words, no option for coffee or water if the maids don't do their job. Bathroom fixtures are very nice, but on one stay they had L'Occitane products (great) and on the next it was some house brand with their logo. (not great) Spa is nice, but restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. Like trained servers that don't just stand around and talk to each other but do stuff like bring you the bill in less than 20 minutes or see if you've finished your drink. I was with a friend who actually bought another friend a drink at the bar and was asking for a fresh beer for himself but the bartender walked away and didn't come back for at least 15 minutes. (They had another male bartender that was really good in fairness and has been there for both my visits.) The loud Mexican hip hop for breakfast was really obnoxious, and I'm not crazy about mariachi bands in hard surfaced rooms at dinner either, but that could just be me. Food is poor to mediocre, and healthy options limited, though the chicken kebab is pretty decent. However, again on the flip side, the valet service is prompt and excellent and the front desk staff very nice. I liked the spa on property as well.The room maintenance is where I think they will eventually have problems. My first stay's room was great, next one had a power outlet next to the bed half yanked out of the wall and some kind of slash mark on the headboard. They also should have security bars or chains on the door, but I only had a single deadbolt. This is not very far from some not great neighborhoods, there should be more than that. On the other hand, again, they have lots of security out front and about the casino. I am just rating the hotel, not the casino, but it seemed pretty nice.So all in all a really mixed bag. Rooms nice, housekeeping sometimes not great, front desk good, restaurant and bar poor. A good choice if you have to be in this area though. Honestly probably not a full four star, but I didn't think they deserved just three.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MusicTraveler2
50,Just Perfect.,"This hotel is a little further out from LAX but worth the drive. Very reasonably priced, the rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. For an extra $10 you can get a very delicious breakfast with hot and cold foods/drinks. The restaurant has specials all the time, we went to the taco night which included hand made tortillas. There's also an Asian restaurant in the hotel. All the staff where very helpful. The hotel also has a pool and spa which everyone needs to check out.This hotel is also a casino, with tables in two huge rooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickles27
50,Family vacation,"At first we were unsure if this hotel would be a good fit for us since we were traveling with children and we don’t gamble. However, we were comfortable throughout our entire stay. The casino seemed to be entirely separate from the hotel. The beds were very comfortable and our room was spacious. The breakfast buffet was awesome and is highly recommended. Pool was not big which I didn’t mind...fitness center is a great perk if you’re trying to fit in a quick workout during your stay (we did). Location also great- just a short drive to Los Angeles. The entire hotel was very clean. Happy we chose this hotel. P.S- there’s a Starbucks inside :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damarar2017
40,Really impressed,I stayed here with my family for two days on our way to Hawaii. I was really impressed with the customer service and the cleanliness of the room. Ordered room service while we were there the food was pretty good.I would recommend for your future stays!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jehovichMedina
50,Reasonable value for a nice hotel near LA,"We are not gamblers so we were pleased that the hotel and casino (card rooms) are quite separate. The parking was a bit confusing, but our suite was gorgeous with a huge bathroom and shower. The hotel appears new, clean and is smoke free. The fitness room is well appointed. Great location with easy access to the freeway. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tapave
50,Poker ( texas holdem ),They fixed up the place and renovated. Way bigger now :) more poker tables for play. Nice atmosphere and great food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luistello2017
50,Our Getaway for R & R,"I've stayed here numerous times, so this review is long overdue. On the other hand, my procrastination could be due to not reveal how nice it is here and find the hotel booked the next time I really want to unwind here. I've only stayed in the Classic and Bicycle suites, so I can't offer any feedback on the standard rooms.When we stay here, we usually order room service and have always enjoyed a good meal. I believe it comes from the same kitchen as the restaurant, so I'm sure it should be the same quality.The service is great and we enjoy everyone that we've met along the way from valet to housekeeping and room service to the front desk. Did I mention how great the staff is at the front desk? I have become on a first name basis with the staff with my frequent visits and have had conversations with the GM, who have all been very accommodating to our needs (which can be special at times).The pool is great, however it is not large and I prefer that. The casino is well appointed and the atmosphere was nice the times we ventured out. Again the suites are why we really frequent here and will continue to be avid guests.If you ever visit LA and need to be in the downtown area, then this spot is close enough to enjoy a less chaotic setting. I highly recommend this place, but please don't spread the word too much to where i can't book a room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sewdr
40,"Lovely hotel, not sure on the restaurant...","Best night sleep I've had since arriving in America!A stylish and comfortable hotel.Really not sure on the restaurant, other guests shouting and screaming at TVs whilst I try to relax and eat dinner is not really ideal.Would stay here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaJayne9

50,Fantastic Hotel and Casino all around!,"We enjoyed our stay with our two kids at this modern, clean well run hotel. The rooms are modern, clean and well appointed. The check-in process was quick and easy with no problems whats so ever. There are great restaurants in the hotel or you can choose to cross the street for a larger choice of dinning options. The pool area is very nice unfortunately there's no hot tub. There is also a $10 resort fee per room per night that I was aware of at the time of booking so I really can't complain. Overall the price and quality of this hotel is great value for the Los Angeles area. I will be definitely returning to this hotel on my next trip to California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravisS_11

50,Great Happy Hour,The Bicycle Hotel & Casino is a fun place to check out. Gambling is really not my thing but I like to go sometimes with my lady to drop a few coins into the slot. They have a great happy hour ceviche bar which was free when I was there. It's a great place to people watch. It is also a great place to watch sporting events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveFawley
40,"Great bathrooms, location & valet parking",We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. It was a great choice. Didn't even walk into the casino.Staff was friendly. Room was spacious and felt new. Bathroom had a huge walkin shower.We needed a place where we could safely and easily park a big SUV even late at night when our flight came in. Valet parking was quick and friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TourDeFork

40,Nice Hotel,"We stayed at The Bicycle Hotel in July to attend a 2-night concert at Dodger Stadium and didn't want to stay in downtown Los Angeles; the hotel was about 10 miles away. The hotel is clean, the rooms very spacious with a nice layout. Loved the extra large shower/tub combination! We found all employees to be very friendly and helpful. They had the free parking closed off when we stayed so we had to Valet park and the Valet attendants were very slow and seemed unorganized, so that was a little inconvenient. Had brunch in the restaurant and it was very good, even though we got in at the end. The casino only offers table games; no machines, so we thought that was a little misleading as I do not remember seeing that in the hotel's information and we were disappointed in that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arcie719
50,The best Casino and restaurant in So. Ca.,"I frequent this establishment with my son. Best to go M-F in the early afternoon, other wise it is packed. The table games and food service is great. They take pride here for being the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165Oldtimer
40,Cool hangout in LA,"Stayed here for a couple of nights, must say its a steal at the price offered for these rooms. The rooms are quite spacious and are modern, the decor is soothing and they have a great restaurant/casino in their premises.The staff is courteous, the front desk helpful and all in all it was a pleasant stay here. We chose the twin queen bed suite, the room offered the view of LA and since we stayed on the 4th of July it was a treat to watch the fireworks from here.Overall I would say the hotel was decent enough for the price, offered all ameneties and free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SundeepClive

40,Hotel Spa visit,"In need of a massage. I chose to visit this spa & use my Groupon deal. The spa is located on the 2nd floor by the pool. Checking in was easy. Since it's my first time, I had to fill out a form. The form that asks for my contact info, what kind of massage I like-areas of concern.Anyways, the front desk clerk gave me a tour & showed me to my locker. Inside the locker is a hanger, my plush bathrobe, sandals, and towels. The locker area has an area with toiletries including a hair dryer.The relaxation room looks very clean. It smells good. Good place to relax. I like the decor with the candles on the wall. Gives it a good touch. Hot tea, bottled water, and fresh fruit are sitting on a table. I do wish there were more snack options available. Like some crackers, fresh cheese, coffee, and a bit of alcohol won't hurt. :)The showers are clean and well maintained. The steam room looks very spacious and smells of eucalyptus. (I can't wait to try it)I had the 50 minute harmony massage. Which I think is equivalent to a Swedish massage. Very nice. I told the masseuse my areas of concern. She listened and concentrated on the areas that were in need of a massage. Linda, was the masseuse's name. Great job.Also, the gym & pool are complimentary amenities when using the spa services at the hotel. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8travelr16

Even though this card room is not like poker rooms in Vegas, Florida or the East Coast, it has other comforts. In addition to the waitresses, there were at least three servers with different carts for coffee, packaged salty snacks and a Latino-inspired cart with cut fruit, tamales and hot dogs. I bought a large cup of papaya with some spicy salt and lemon for $2, quite the deal. The crowd was diverse, largely middle-aged and majority Latino. While I was there, the jackpot hit on a 4/8 limit table; pretty exciting for those folks.The dealers and floor were ok but not great.

The rooms were very nicely appointed, the bed comfortable. I am not a fan of feather pillows and that's what they had. The entry way was tiled and the furniture a dark wood.This location is a casino. If you're expecting it to be anything like Vegas, you're in for a huge surprise. I can't say anything about the gambling as I didn't play any tables. It's just very open, very busy, very bright (not dark like Vegas) and food trays everywhere. It was odd.Now the bar situation. While we were having a beer at the bar there was an argument going on with two customers and one of the bartenders. Turns out they were frequent gamblers there and they were upset because a casino host paid for their drinks and they got a tab. Also, when their Hennessey was poured, each glass did not have the same amount so that upset them. Turns out the real argument came when the bartender took the glasses and poured them back in the bottle after the men had already drank out of them!!! YIKES!!! They made the bartender empty the bottle out into the sink. Disgusting. Of course once we heard this, the next glasses of beer came with dirty glasses. Needless to say we would NOT recommend drinking from this bar. EVER. We also ordered the steak nachos and not very impressed.If it weren't for the location (a bit out of the way for what we wanted, and a little run down) and the disgusting bar, we'd definitely stay there again. Specifically because the room was so nice and comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieH1973
40,Really surprised me,"Like other reviews, you drive near the place and it looks super sketchy but the place isn't AT ALL. Place is very well lit, clean and much bigger than it looks outside. I just wish they had more Vegas type games but we got lucky on blackjack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzysa20
40,Surprise hotel,"Had business in Downey and had to get a hotel off I5. Was surprised at how nice the hotel was in the casino. Clean modern room, affordable for the area and free parking. Room was nicer than a Marriott or even a Hilton.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rungreencoyote
50,Awesome and Delicious!,"Let me start by saying, TRY the BIKE BREWERY first! The Flat Iron Steak is a fantastic menu item and the wait staff impeccable! Ok, so it is not Las Vegas but who says you cannot have a little fun and good food. This casino is surprisingly quaint, affordable and beautiful! The entire facility has gone through a 360-degree renovation, and it was worth every dime the owners invested.From the moment you pull into valet parking, you feel like you are in another world. The lighting, the cleanliness of the facility, the welcoming smiles of the staff are all things I was impressed. If you stay at this hotel, you will want to play in this casino. If you are looking to come back to earth, there is an Applebees across the street but who needs that when inside you are going to find great food at an affordable price. Need I say more?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellos689

10,First and last visit,"The Asian staff here (particularly the Chinese) is unattentive and plays favoritism. My brother and I arrived here on 08-27-2016 and after checking to our room we decided to try our luck at the Baccarat tables. We had bought in for a total of between 10K to 18K total, while we're at the table a chinese lady inform us that with our knid of play we should ask if they would comp. our rooms, at thei time I ask to speak to a host (both was Chinese) and they informed me that they could NOT help us. Howerver, the Chinese couple at the table next to us was comped. This is very up setting to us and I informed the Day manager the next day and he gave us 2 days comped. Moreover, this still does not change the fact that they only favorites to only Chinese players and I feel that this is not right or even ethical. The management should know what their employees are doing. I would Not reccommmend this place to anyone unless of course you are Chinese.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693duken
50,Nice find!,"We booked this hotel through Expedia as it was good value. The hotel rooms are beautiful, quiet, spacious and well maintained. It's a casino hotel and the casino is not far from the main lobby and very open so hanging around with children is not really an option but as a base to visit LA it was great. Staff very friendly, lots of security and even good views of the city from the 7th floor. Lots of places to eat in the area. Parking available. Wifi excellent. There is a pool and spa but did not use them as we out all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950francesr
50,Nice hotel,"Friendly staff, suits are very nice and large, with great bathroom, clean rooms , modern,worth the price , valet parking guys are active and understanding, location is not so bad .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6029IJmohammeda
50,Perfect stay,"Visiting Los Angeles for the first time and took me so long to find a decent hotel. I'm very glad I booked at the Bicycle Hotel & Casino as the rooms were amazing. The room and bathroom was huge, clean and spacious. The staff was very friendly and helpful too. I cannot comment on the casino part as I didn't check it out. The only tiny complaint I have is there does not seem to be enough space for guest parking. We came back one night at around 9 and all the spaces were taken and had to park in the visitors side, which was almost full too. Also for those here to visit tourist attractions, it is a bit far from Hollywood. The freeway was close but traffic was horrendous so keep that in mind. Overall I was disappointed I had to leave as I was heading to Anaheim. Will definetly choose the hotel again if I were to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itmfan84
40,Nice value for money,"I visited this hotel on my journey to LA, I got nice huge room , service was very attentive . Value for money is ok. It was few not good things like it is far for everywhere (traffic jams in LA are really unbearable) , cleaning of the room should be improved",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82michalr
40,"Very nice hotel ok casino decent food, overall it was good.","The hotel was very nice the shower was amazing. The pool looked clean and nice but i did not get a chance to jump in. The casino is ok I did win some money though, the room service was cold but the food downstairs was very good the staff was nice. overall I would stay here again I enjoyed myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5768NSroberts
50,Just amazing,"We had a wonderful time at the Bicycle Casino. The staff were nice, rooms were clean, and the price was reasonable. I found it hard to wake up because the beds were so comfortable. Definitely recommend this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marargelf
50,Fabulous!,"The hotel is one of the best I have stayed in a long time. The room was beautiful and I had a nice view of the town.The best treat for me was getting a massage. The spa is very clean, comfortable, and peaceful. My massage was fantastic!I stayed at the hotel for a week. I was pleased to see a plethora of restaurants and stores in the vicinity.I can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730reeset
40,Room is spacious,"Room is big and clean. Bathroom is also very clean. Staff is friendly. Many fast food restaurants within walking distance. Free parking avaiLable, but during weekends, parking at hotel is often full and we had to parking at the casino side. It takes a 5-10min walk through the casino to the hotel. Only complaint is the wifi. It is too slow, my phone have to reconnect every 15mins.Overall a pleasant stay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EYHM
40,Good hotel,"We stayed here as part of our tour round California.The first impression was not great when we entered through the casino hall (looks like a big old bingo hall).There is however parking round the front which was great. The rooms are lovely and bathroom amazing!The pool was nice, warm and quiet which was lovely. It's about a 40min drive into LA and 30mins to Disney or universal which was great for the price. The hotel isn't busy so very relaxing.The bar downstairs is good with lots of beer options.Only downside is the reception staff and poor planning. We are here on vacation and asked about a chiense restaurant and were asked if we had used an online site to look ourselves....I asked the front of house as we aren't local and wanted some help.They also don't have a map of the local area so we were left to fend for ourselves in an unfamiliar country and city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljm1001
40,Great for business and a wee bit of lesuire,"Stayed here for 7 nights on a business trip. The room was great with views looking over Bell Gardens and further. Very spacious with extremely comfy beds. The pool was heated and always nice to go to during my time off. The breakfast in the morning is awesome with so much to choose from and the restaurant itself is great too! Easy to get to the freeway, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k4t2016
40,Impressive suites,We had a friend's bachelor party here and really like what they have done with the place everything was new and for the most part very accommodating. Did have a few bumps I didn't get my second room till after 6pm and the governors suite had a strong odor in the master bath that would not go away even after we called to have them look at it. Only reason for 4 stars....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/otalay
50,Great stay at a great hotel..,"We stayed two nights with children aged 7 and 11.We loved the hotel and the staff, thet were all welcoming and helpfull.The room was very nice and the beds very really good.We enjoyed it so much we decided to book it for another stay when we return to LA next week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mortens477
50,New. Clean. Very nice. Recommended.,"I was planning to go out to East LA on business and was having trouble finding a reasonably priced hotel that wasn't a little sketchy. This hotel was recommended to me by a business associate, so I tried it. For about the same price as other big name brand hotel chains in the area, I was very pleasantly surprised.The hotel is only about six months old and the entire hotel is very clean. I saw people constantly cleaning. Great staff. My room was very nice with a very comfortable bed and temperature controls. Upscale furnishings in the bedroom and bathroom areas. Keurig unit in the room with free hot tea and coffee choices.Hotel has a few eating/drinking choices on site. We ate dinner at The Bike Brewery. Food was very good and priced well. Two of us ate and had two drinks each for less than $35. We ate breakfast at the Coffee Bakery House and that was also good. They served Starbucks coffee.As far as the casino goes, don't think Las Vegas. There are no slots - only table games, and standards like roulette and craps are not there. All card games, like black jack, baccarat, poker, etc. But there are lots of tables of each if this is your thing.Overall, this was a great choice. When I am back in this area, I will definitely stay here again, and I recommend it to you as well. For the same price as other big chain hotels in the area, this one beats them hands down for quality, cleanliness and amenities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenS9
50,Great Find,We had a marvelous Sunday Brunch at The Anaheim Hills Golf Course before heading to The Bicycle Hotel and Casino. We checked in a little early but the desk staff said she would rush a room to be cleaned on the top floor while we explored the facility. The pub restaurant drinks and food were reasonable. They also had a buffet brunch going until 4pm but we were glad we had a bit of a more formal one before we arrived. It is a casino we believe for card playing in a relatively quiet atmosphere. There was match play and food and beverage credits plus parking which added to the value of t he overnight stay.The rooms were well appointed with a very large bath/shower.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjresh
40,Great hotel but the casino is just OK,"I came to LA just for a weekend visit and I wanted a hotel that was relatively close but affordable. The hotel was REALLY nice... We checked in early and enjoyed the surrounding amenities (tons of restaurants nearby). The hotel food was pretty reasonable and we got $1 drinks because it was ladies night. However, I thought I would want to gamble because it is a casino. Now I have only gambled in Vegas in Puerto rico so I don't know much about casino's, but this casino was very basic. All they had was poker, no black jack or roulette or really any slot machines. I turned around because it looked to me more like a bingo hall. However, I didn't come for the casino I came for the hotel which is why it has such high reviews. Overall I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleydee972
50,"Immaculate Hotel, Well Priced, Close To Freeway","We stayed here as a last minute booking looking for a hotel in the LA area and we were incredible surprised. I assume it wasn't booked out simply due to it being so new and having a lack of reviews online.The hotel itself was attached to the casino, but can't have been open for more than a month or two as everything was brand new. The rooms were immaculate and the staff were incredibly helpful.You can valet for $7 per day or self park for free, the restaurant / bar downstairs was incredible and the coffee shop (a renamed Starbucks) was perfect for us each morning for a coffee and snack before heading out. It's less than 100 metres from the freeway and has fast food and other shops within walking distance.Perfect place to stay if you're after a 4+ star hotel for the price of a motor inn in the LA area, providing you have a car to get yourself around as it is a 15 minute drive out of LA / Hollywood (45 minutes or more if peak hour)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akaNorman
50,"Great vibe! Good rates, clean, friendly and safe","We chose this place because of the location to Hollywood area, Disney, Universal and the Beach ( 20 minutes to half hour drives ) and the price (very reasonable) we were delighted that the hotel is just as clean and new as in the pictures. The modern look of the hotel makes gives a really fun vibe. Our guest room has plenty of room for four people to spread out and I love that the bathroom is layer out so that it can be shared. There is a huge walk in shower. The beds and linens are super comfortable. Everything here is modern and up to date, and there is a huge security presence here, which our family appreciates. The pool area is very comfortable and had wonderful Cabana rooms!! We have enjoyed eating at the restaurant ( I had a fantastic shrimp meal I couldn't finish for only $12 dollars and $1.00 cocktails) and the coffee shop ( delicious sandwiches and pastries for a great price) and all of the staff have been friendly and accommodating. I can't say anything bad about this hotel. Would recommend to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl3781
40,Great stay and experience!,"We arrived at the Bicycle Hotel at 7 am very tired after 2 nights of sleeping in a 'closet' on an Amtrak train! James at reception kindly allowed us a much appreciated, very early check in. He and all the staff we encountered at reception were very professional, friendly and helpful. Our room on the 4th Floor was a good size, comfortable bed and great bathroom (shower only) along with bathrobes. Keurig coffee maker (I did have to flag down housekeeping to get some caffeinated coffee as we only had tea and decaf), a couple of free waters daily, chocolate on the pillow. Plenty of outlets for charging etc., nice big flat screen tv. We called the Spa to book a massage, left a message which was not returned. Did visit the spa a few days later and was given a personal tour of a great facility by several very helpful staff members. Also used the very well equipped gym and visited a lovely pool on a cool, windy day. The cabanas and bar will be great on a warmer day. Enjoyed the excellent breakfast buffet ($10) daily at the Brewery...great omelettes...also good cocktails, snacks and a few meals here too. There was supposed to be an Asian restaurant opening soon. Starbucks and a small shop selling basic needs were also available. And the Casino? Somehow, we did not know there were no slot machines here...not a problem as we were here for the poker which was well run in pleasant surroundings. There is not much in this neighborhood so adding some entertainment and fine dining would keep guests in the hotel, but an uber ride into LA (depending on time of day) is less than 30 minutes away!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamm333
50,"This is quite the place to visit while in town, you MUST experience at least once!","I think this place is a Los Angeles Hidden gem right here in LA's own Bell Gardens---seemingly overlooked or under-rated. Well let me tell you that if I could, I am here tot ell you that you, this hotel and casino is a MUST see and experience at least once while in LA if you could. Everything from the LUXE feel and comfort of it's awesome all newly built hotel, to it's rich variety of SO cal's most exciting and popular card games in it's various excellently planned floors of gaming it has to offer to it's players. While it may sound like I'm really talking this place up , all I can really say is come , come and see for yourslef, and you will know exactly why I make The Bicycle casino and hotel a MUST see while in the LA area and experince at least once while here for yourself attraction for sure, no doubt!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyhR4656ET
40,Pretty good and hope for the future,"I had not been to the ""bike"" for quite some time. I decided to check out the hotel and it was fantastic. Rooms are nicely appointed and they have a quiet policy. Complimentary water and coffee. I tried the Brewery restaurant and it was good. I took off a star because valet parking didn't seem to know what to do when I asked if I could valet. I ended up parking in disabled. Fortunately the walk is not far. There is still more work to be done and some customer service improvements are needed in general but the bike is still a fun place to stay and play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ndwca
40,Nice hotel in a not-so-nice neighborhood,"The rooms are very nice & modern, very comfortable mattress, & because we were upgraded to a suite, we had a very spacious master bath along with a half bath in the living room area. I'm glad we were able to get an upgrade because the room they originally had us in faced the freeway & smelled horrible. I'm not sure what was causing this odor but it was not going away so we were able to enjoy this great suite for 5 nights. We only ate at the hotel once which was for happy hour and I do recommend it. The food & service were great & the prices were too. I had ceviche tostadas for $3 and my husband had a nice sized quesadilla for $4. We didn't have any alcohol so I can't report on the prices but I'm sure they were reasonable. My husband played poker one time at The Bike & said the people there were a little sketchy. It would've been nice if they had had reserved parking for hotel guests, we had to walk so far every night! Also, if you want to spend time in LA, be prepared to spend a lot of time in your car, the traffic was almost always horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aztxcat

40,For Players,"The Bicycle Hotel is brand new as of December, 2015; the casino has been around for awhile. I stayed during its second weekend in operation. The rooms are decent, clean, and well-decorated. It's really a gambler's world at the Bicycle, and I don't really gamble. I came to meet some friends from out of town who wanted to stay at the Bicycle for a poker tournament; I honestly wasn't expecting much out of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised as it felt a little (not completely) like Vegas upon entering the hotel. The hotel has a brewery restaurant, bakery, and spa attached to it. If you're into poker, blackjack, and other card games (no slot machines), you'll have a good time at the Bicycle. Here's a tip: if you get a player's card, rooms are 25% off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingjamie
40,"New Hotel, big improvements","Visited the Bike on a recent December Saturday night. Great new Porte Cochere entrance, big improvement over prior entrance. Valet parking $5.00. The poker room sold out at 10pm this night for a brief period, over 82 rables going , all cash games. Space available by 11pm.New food offerings include The Bicycle Brewery, very good food, chicken, burgers, steaks, apps, all good. Service choppy, disjointed, but they were only open four days. Give them a chance here.Existing deli still the same, new bakery with sweets and coffee, yum.Did not see new hotel or lobby. Will stay on a subsequent visit, soon.Clear choice in LA now for full service hotel/restaurant/cardroom between The Bicycle and The Commerce. Consumer will be a winner in the ongoing battle to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveC95818

Spacious gaming area and nicely outfitted. Good restaurants too! Enjoy your gaming. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Another honest review...,"I visited the Bike to play some poker on LATB and eat dinner. I'll just say that when others claim that LA is the poker capital of the World, they're not kidding! The room was packed with players and lots of action. You can easily find a game at any stakes and guaranteed that they will hand you their money. The staff is very knowledgeable and hospitable. They are opening their hotel very soon. It looked very nice and would be a great option for those that play deep into the night and don't want to drive in the LA traffic. Now, for the real highlight. I ordered the Dragon Galbi from the table side menu and it was PHENOMENAL! It was so perfectly seasoned and cooked that my mouth is still watering as I think about it. I would fly back to LA just to play here and eat Dragon Galbi!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tesheets
40,decent place,"I didn't stay here that long. It was a few months ago, though I don't remember anything bad about it. Action seemed OK/good with lots of games to choose from. I'd revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unagiroll
50,Pleasantly surprised plus outstanding food,"I was under The impression that Commerce was nicer than Bicycle (never having been to Bicycle before). I finally went to ""bike"". Wow I was impressed (although Commerce has the more fancy entrance). Tables had a little more space between them. Tables sat 9 players rather than 10. Chairs are very comfortable. But what was outstanding is the food at The Legonds Cafe. I wished we lived near here, instead of 5 hours away, because that is our new favorite place to eat. Great food with large portions (had 2 meals there - could not finish either one - and I'm a big guy. And the cost was very inexpensive. I can hardly wait until they finish the on site hotel, cause we will definitely be back there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobw570

40,Very good Poker,Visited Bicycle Casino for the WPT Legends of poker Tournament and I found it very professional. As far as Casinos go it is more suited and caters for Poker Players more and for me that was perfect. It is not in the best area but I stayed right across the street in the Comfort inn. The parking they had was also save and well lit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacoRSA
40,Poker action,"This place has been upgraded a ton in the last few years since last time I was here 5-10 years ago. Poker tables are good, rake is a bit high at 5 plus 1 bonus each hand. They did offer free food for players which was good. Also a golf cart shuttle to the front door in well lit parking lot, security looked good. Lots of people, lots of action, live at the bike going in the corner, fun times. Would return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cursive9
