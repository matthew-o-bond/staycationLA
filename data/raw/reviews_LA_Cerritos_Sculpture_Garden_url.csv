40,Small but Delightful in Artistic Forms,This small oasis is not far from the Cerritos Civic Center and the library. It offers paved paths with assessable seating. A myriad of sculptures set apart from each other allows you to view each one from a different angle. This pla.ce is reminiscent of the Hirschorn Sculpture Garden in Washington DC because it offers such a good variety of sculptures.,Joseph C
50,Beauty & Peace,This is a very quiet and peaceful garden. I go here when I want a place to sit down and think and just enjoy the outdoors in quietness. There are many modern sculptures and even a bench area to sit down.,aanyiam02
40,Nicely maintained sculpture garden,"My girlfriend and I were on our annual trip and this year was Los Angeles. We had some time before going to the hotel on our final day of the trip and, since it was on our way, we decided to stop and take a look. The park is well maintained and is handicap accessible. The sculptures were interesting and thought provoking. It was take you under an hour to see everything.",alpw

50,"Great Park ,near a great library with Muesum Quality Exhibits and Aquarium, great free places to visit!","A very wide variety of sculpture in this small garden. My favorites were the elemental women, but I was glad that there were many works that I would not normally bother viewing. My teens liked the variety of abstract work as well. There is also a great Library just a block away from this place in addition to a fountain/dolphin sculpture kids can play in. So you can have some Sea World style fun for free and without the evil whale torture.",Brandon S
50,A Nice Surprise,Wasn't expecting much as the reviews said it was small. I was really surprised to see such a nicely designed space with interesting sculptures. We enjoyed walking the grounds of the civic center and the fabulous library with its amazing fish tank in the entrance. Really worth a stop if you are in the area!,BoboTravlr
40,small but powerful,"have been there twice, a small park with a mix of pieces, some very ""Rodin-ish"" and some very stylized and modern but all worthy of being seen. Also take a look at the installations around the library in the same complex.",eh2bh2eh
50,A Nifty Garden,"For a relatively small city, Cerritos has a nice municipal garden full of interesting sculptures, including one that commemorates a fatal air crash of an Alaska Airlines plane that plowed into the homes of several residents that happened decades ago. Cerritos had its own 9/11.",Norbert C
40,Local out of the way park by the library,Took lots of pics here for fun and with local models for their portfolio. Nice hidden park with really interesting sculptures.,motocyclo69
50,A hidden gem,"Tucked away next to the Sheriff's station, this small patch of secluded serenity offers a wide variety of art work. The statues commemorate those who lost their lives in the Cerritos air disaster, copy famed masterpieces and challenge the modern with modern expressions of v whatever the desrptiveplaque tells you. Park in the library lot.",Bob H
50,Small park yet beautiful,"To me, the most significant sculpture here is the one that memorializes the Air Crash that happened in the City in 1986. The crash killed 82 people including 15 on the ground. It sparked a major change LAX flight procedures.It is located next to the Cerritos Public Library (another impressive landamrk in the city)",Ashish G
40,Cerritos Sculpture Garden is a Hidden Gem,"In the middle of the city of Cerritos there is a tiny sculpture garden that is pretty much hidden. It's rare to see anyone there, so I think it is a great place to experience a little solace and peace from the hubbub of daily life. You can just sit and look at the sculptures, or bring a book or lunch and just chill out. It's free, so why not?",Karin W
40,A nice quiet park,"This is a nice quiet park where you can come to relax. The sculptures are not particularly earth-shattering, but it's a neat area to stop by for awhile.",Jonathan H
50,Beautiful,This area is beautiful consisting of a mini waterfall and multiple sculpture. I took my graduation photos here and they came out nothing but amazing. Many people do photoshoots here. There is ample amount of parking and it is located near a sheriff station along with the Cerritos Library,Priyanka N. P

50,Serene park,Cerritos Sculpture Garden is part of a complex where the L.A. County Sheriff Station and Cerritos Library are situated. It is a nice place to take environmental garden pictures. A friend's daughter used it after her wedding to take pictures of the bridal party. They have a new coiled piece that I really enjoy. There is a memorial to the people that died in a plane crash near there several years ago. I have used other pieces for my photography classes to illustrate different principles that we were learning. There are othe sculptured pieces near this garden in a fountain near the library. It is a nice place to walk around and meditate.,Carol M
40,A nice respite in the middle of the city,"I get the feeling I'm not in Cerritos but in the French chateau or Italian villa gardens.Best of all: FREE admission!Very interesting sculptures here. Mix of modern and classic styles spread over a large area. Also water features give a pleasant relaxing vibe to the place. Ground is fine gravel, so I do suggest wearing non-slip shoes.Photo worthy, many wedding or graduation etc...photographers use this as a backdrop.Also of note, there is a memorial to the tragic Aero Mexico crash that occurred in the August 21, 1986. The smaller Piper plane involved in the mid-air collision leading to the crash is similarly depicted in the sculpture.",JoyceA
50,Great place to take wedding photos,We went there to take my daughter's wedding pictures and it was free and no crowds like Heritage park. You can park at the library and many nice spots to choose from.,pat-artesia
50,Small but artistic!,"The Sculpture Garden itself is small, but worth taking your time to walk through it. Each of the pieces on display in the Garden are quite unique and beautiful. The first piece you see as you walk up to the Garden is called Infinity. I am not sure, but this piece has a water trough surrounding it that was empty, perhaps due to the water shortage? The piece to the right of the Infinity sculpture is called Mirage and is beautiful to look at. As you continue on, the next piece you come upon is called The Elements. The sculpture of this piece is quite lovely! It reminds me of an artist still working on his piece. You should walk around each one of the elements to see the individual beauty of all four of the elements, fire, water, wind and earth. Lovely! There are other pieces in the garden to look at, but don't forget to look at the garden itself, because it too is a piece of art! The winding levels of grass or the semi circles of plants around the tree. There is beauty all around. I would suggest taking the time to give homage to the Air Disaster Memorial that is located inside the garden. This Memorial is for the lives that were lost in on August 31, 1986 when two planes collided over the city of Cerritos. As you leave the Garden, you will also see artwork and sculptures in the 'square' near the Cerritos library. Don't forget to stop at the Cerritos Veterans Memorial too which is only a few short steps away. If you take your time to thoroughly look over all the time, skills, imagination and effort put into all the artwork, you will not be disappointed. It can take you as little as 20 minutes to briskly walk through the Garden and square, or it can take an hour or more, depending on how much you enjoy looking at beautiful art! This is a great way to spend some time outdoors, enjoying fresh air, perhaps having lunch on one of the area benches while viewing the art. Take you time, take in the beauty, relax and enjoy your time here. Again, you will not be disappointed.",charlottesl
30,Okay; I Expected More.,"When I think of a sculpture garden, I think of a place with at least 10-15 sculptures. When I first went to the garden, there were only 5 sculptures! Over time, they added more sculptures, amounting to almost 10, but I really think they should do something else with the space. It's a relaxing place to go, though, just like the Cerritos Library.",Schwarzschild
50,Relax and enjoy,This is a place to contemplate and relax. The sculptures are lovely. It also pays tribute to the airplane disaster of August (year not recalled).,Rosa S
30,A quite garden but not too much to see,"There are only 6 sculptures in this garden, while tons of sculptures are available on the streets of Cerritos. Therefore, if you are looking for sculptures, don't limit yourself to the garden. Walk around the city and enjoy the public arts.The garden is an ideal place to enjoy a quite sunset in autumn.",flora z

40,quiet reprieve,"This little park is tucked away by the library. The sculptures bring variety and class. The memorial to those who died in the plane crash gives honor and dignity.

50,Unique gardens for a small city,"Statues of all types, tributes, historical and a serene place to relax. A must stop when in Cerritos",genealogygail
50,A quiet and contemplative place.,"The sculpture garden is predominantly known for the memorial to the Cerritos air crash and for this reason its a good place to go to reflect and remember those who were killed in this tragedy, and in other air tragedies. But there are other pieces of art to enjoy in this wonderfully safe and pleasant neighbourhood.",Ruth N
