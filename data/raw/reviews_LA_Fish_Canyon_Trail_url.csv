40,Great Waterfalls,"A relatively easy hike. You definitely should wear some hiking boots because you will encounter some loose rocks towards the end of the hike. If you reach the end of the trail, you will see a beautiful three-tiered waterfall Of course, when I did this hike, it had rained quite a bit. It has not rained much this year. So, I'm not sure if you will see a waterfall currently?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryp661
40,Great Reward - CLOSED NOW DUE TO 2016 FIRE,This hike was my first solo hike. I am so happy I did it. I got there about the time they open the parking lot and there were already 8 cars ahead of me. The trail is very well maintained and pretty easy to follow. I would suggest this for beginners and families. It does get pretty crowded so either get there early or hike during the weekdays if you want to avoid the crowds. The falls were going pretty good in April but I am not sure when they dry up. There are no permits required to park or to hike. For more information about the trailhead and the trail visit my blog just google lovz2hike. Happy Hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovz2sun
50,One of the great 3 stage water fall in San Gabriel Valley,"Free! no need to pay parking at the trail head. It is a three hours 4.8 Miles trail, Altitude change is about 400ft(A very pleasant walking trail). At the end of the trail there is a three stage water fall. This is one of the tallest fall in San Gabriel Valley and it is 80 feet. When one have to use their hands and feet, you are almost there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhishaol
