50,Perfect Day!!!,Perfect way to enjoy the iconic Getty Museums and Meditation Garden with our own private tour guide and driver. It was so wonderful and relaxing to sit back and be driven thru horrible LA traffic by Glenn throughout our day. Glenn was AWESOME and thought of everything to ensure our entire experience exceeded our expectations. Will definitely schedule another tour experience with Glenn/ECG.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces624479

50,Great Tour!,"I don't drink so the guide was flexible enough to find an olive oil tasting which was delicious! The food at the tavern was amazing, and a nice cool spot to rest. My favorite part was seeing the courthouse because I'm really into ceramic tile. Overall the experience was one of the most relaxing and memorable tours I've been on, well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113saritam
50,Los Angeles New Years Eve,"Glenn was a phenomenal guide! This was my first time to California and we were only here for a few days to bring in the new year on one of my dream trips. He brought us to all the sites I had on my bucket list! We got to take the most amazing photos including Beverly Hills, Hollywood and Venice beach and experience some of the local treasures all of the areas have to offer! Glenn was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. I highly recommend this tour to anyone coming to the Los Angeles area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellescolon
40,Good Tour,Enjoyed our day with Glenn who enabled us to see a great deal of the LA in the day. He made sure we saw the areas of interest to us rather than a “fixed itinerary” during our limited time in the City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmR8749OP
20,Private 6 hour tour,"Knowledgeable tour guide. We were 8 people on the tour. Manage to fit in all the places specified in the tour as a drive by . Very very rushed at the limited stops we did make. Even just for a pic. Rodeo drive was literally sprint to the famous stairs take a pic sprint back to bus , disappointment and rushed . so was the Farmers market an amazing place where we supposedly stop for a lunch stop and shop .Its not possible in 30 minutes, didn’t even eat as getting to sprinkles takes a good 15 minutes. Good if you want to do a drive through tour only and short on time.Did not Enjoy this tour .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raeesa1966

50,Saw it all,Brilliant tour around LA thanks to Glen. Took us to places we didn’t even know existed. Nothing too much trouble,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerb230
50,Wonderful private tour,"A fun and convenient tour of LA! The car was roomy and clean. We were able to control how much time we spent in each location. I was really impressed by how much the guide was able to tell us about each of the locations and the history of the different areas that we visited. And he was very familiar with more local places. Since we wee able to avoid traffic jams, we even got to visit another place that wasn’t on the schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliceWong7
