50,Peaceful Oasis,Midst the sometimes frenetic LA experience lies this tranquil & interesting oasis. Those in quest of nature will be happy here. It is a built facility but one in harmony with its setting. Strongly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markian
50,Great spot for the kids,"I swear that I come across some of the most interesting low key kids places in the darndest places. This would be one of them. This Audubon center has kids making field trips here as well as parental trips on the weekends. I instantly knew when I realized what was happening here, that the munchkin would love to stop by.This Center is a great starting/stopping point if you want to hike through Earnest E Debs Regional Park. It sits on the southwestern edge and has a parking lot with a roundabout. The parking spaces are over dirt with a paved road. They have public restrooms that the hikers can easily access as well as visitors to the center. Best of all, this place is FREE to visit and get a nature lesson for your tots. Or at least an opportunity to interact with something tangible in lieu of electronics or iThings. That alone is priceless!Pro Tip: You can host a kids birthday or other party here for a slightly different outlook on birthdays =)They have a short children's nature walk, multiple interactive features made for munchkins, a kids clubhouse, picnic tables, a classroom/small auditorium for lessons or speakers. There is also an information room with an attendant on duty willing to share different aspects of the park, Audubon center, native flora n fauna, animals, or stuff like that. Another fun feature at the entrance and on the edge of the roundabout is a koi pond... but they don't have koi fish in it that I saw, however it had some guppies and a few lily pads.Overall though this place seemed very kewl for the little ones. While I was in the information room, a little boy and his dad stopped in and handed over a field trip something or other for a prize. Both seemed rather happy IMHO. That is something that I think should be encouraged continually.Pro Tip #2: The parking lot is closed when the Audubon center is =XDefinitely a fun quick freebee kinda place to stop in and burn an hour or stop by after a hike... it makes for some relaxed nature interaction, even for a grown up... or someone who refuses to grow up like me =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schel74
