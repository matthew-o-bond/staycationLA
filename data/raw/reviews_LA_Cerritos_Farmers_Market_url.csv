40,Great Market Lots of fresh vegetables that I had never seen before.,"All the products are fresh but a little more expensive than your local supermarket, but where else can you get Chinese lettuce. The market is open rain or shine from 8:00pm to noon on Saturdays, and there is lots of parking nearby. The eggs are fantastic, and my wife loves the green beans, which she says are fresh picked and not dry and limp like other places. There is also a wide range of other products like fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs, fish, bread, nuts, honey, flowers and many different types of greens.TIP: Animals are not allowed in the farmers' market so please leave them at home.",Michael B
40,Pretty good,The food was good from there but the only bad thing was that you could see the former is pulling the guts out of crabs,Caleb P
50,Loved this Farmer's Market.,"Discovered this market by accident on a Saturday morning while staying 2 nights at the Sheraton Cerritos. This was right next door across the way. We could see the vendors & tents from in front of the hotel. There are tons of fresh fruits & veggies, many of them organic. There was a honey stand, a bakery stand, a Mexican food stand, a clown blowing up balloons for the kids, fresh flowers, a person playing music, lots of samples to try. And, inexpensive! I was impressed by the quality & prices. Wish I lived here. I would be here every week. I believe the hours are 9am to 1 or 2pm. Be sure to check first.",ssg47
