50,Very serene,Cemeteries can be very daunting when you visit them. But if you look at them as though they are like a park-like setting then it can be a beautiful experience. I have relatives and friends buried here which I visit very frequently. When I come it never fails that there are people who really enjoy spending time with their loved ones sitting in chairs and children running around. There are areas that are always filled with beautiful flowers. The grounds are impeccable and always groomed. Flowers are removed every Thursday. This is a very peaceful place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeane141
50,As nice as Cemeteries can be,Sadly I have too many friends buried here. The staff AND the grounds crew are nice and very helpful. I went to visit a departed friends grave & couldn't find it. I had the map in my hand walking in circles. One of the grounds crew stopped working and came over to help me. I thought that was extremely nice! Found the grave marker with his help. Thsi cemetery is well maintained and clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawaiigirl9

40,Odd but interesting,"This is a station dedicated to educating the public about ecosystems and preserving them. While there are a number of interesting animals and reptiles housed here, they have a bigger message to provide. There are a number of observations about the different ecosystems in the city and the efforts to clean up areas like the beaches and local creeks. Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411gennyd
