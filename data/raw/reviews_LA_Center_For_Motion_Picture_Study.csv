30,Very nice building and park,We visited on a Segway tour with a stop to discuss the building and the academy. The building was beautiful especially nestled between the park and the tennis courts. It was much more impressive than the one on Wilshire where the films are viewed. Interesting to know all the motion picture history that has occurred there.,Grover R
50,This is Hollywood's history & story,"I was fortunate enough to finally visit here, words cannot describe my feelings of seeing this library & media motion picture center, it has something for all and for someone like me who has been a lifetime admirer of cinema this was a dream come true and honestly left me breathless as I was given a tour and was able to see what and how this center is run, it's preservation efforts as well a posters, photos, not to mention an array of books and reference materials. I wished I was a better writer since I cannot really describe in true detail so make sure this is on your list when you visit, I'll be their in a few weeks and this is again the 1st stop I'll be making",wallyreidjr
