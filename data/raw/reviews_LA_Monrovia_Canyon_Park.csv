50,Amazing Hike near-by,"It's amazing hike for beginners as well as experienced ones. Easy for young and old.Yesterday we went the whole family and we drop some in the beginning and the rest we wanted to do only a mile up and a mile down to the waterfall, so we parked in the upper parking. Parking at the week end is $10 per car and during the week it's only $5 per car. We took photos and when we put them on our social media, our friends thought it's in Hawaii hahahahahah.Great experience and the weather was just perfect. Loved it and for sure I will be back.One more thing, take a good book and enjoy it there.",Luxury T
50,Waterfall hike,I came hiking with my dog. Try to park on the residential streets to avoid paying for parking. My hike was pleasant... No rubbish and not crowded. It was quiet and peaceful.i plan to return again soon.,Vittoria H
50,It’s like something out of a fairytale!,"One of my fave local hikes! It’s like something out of a fairy tale the further you hike in towards the falls! Super peaceful when it’s not crowded. Weekdays are often a lot less crowded. I had the falls to myself for a while today which is unusual. Weekends can be pretty packed.You can park on the street in the residential area as some have mentioned, which saves you the fee, but it’s quite a walk from there to get to the falls imo. Parking is $5 weekdays and currently $6 weekends/holidays, but as of 2/1/20, it will be going up to $10 on weekends/holidays! Weekdays is staying at $5. Ample parking available and nice picnic areas.I haven’t ever seen any bears or snakes any of the times I’ve been. There are a few spots where you have to cross the stream, but there are ample rocks to step on. It’s about 3/4 mile to the falls from the upper parking lot. There are several little man made dams along the way that create little waterfalls also. Oh and be sure to wear decent hiking shoes! I had some old tennis shoes on today and I slipped several times on the loose dirt/rocks going downhill!",TravelingMerm
40,Locals know it’s a gem,"This did not seem to be a place mentioned much at all by travel materials, but it was very popular. Everyone we talked to was from the area. It is very well maintained, and the waterfall is worth the hike. By our Maine park standards, where we often see next to nobody on our hikes, it is quite crowded. Do be careful; there are a fair number of drop offs there not roped off along the trail. Parking can also be very limited; we had to wait for cars to leave to be allowed in. We liked that there was a Little Free Library at the Nature Center. Worth the trip!",James M
50,Waterfall hike,"This is a beautiful little hike!Save a photo of the trail maps to your phone so you won’t need internet to access it. The nature center didn’t have any more copies of the map when we arrived.The road to get here is narrow and full of pedestrians, please do not take this road in a rush.Parking is $5 on week days and $6 on weekends. Bring cash for this.There is lots of dirt, rocks, plants, and water. Best of all, there is lots of SHADE!Bring and already be wearing bug repellant.The journey to the falls is uphill. Parts of the path become narrow, share the path and be patient taking turns sharing the path with travelers going the opposite directions.BEARS: Black bears live here. This is their home.That being said, please do not feed the bears. I posted video and photo of the bears we saw.The water is beautifully clear!Cell service is spotty so best to stay together as a group.",Elle F

50,"Monrovia Canyon Falls Hike, Monrovia","Length: 3 miles out and back Effort: easy Climb: 311 feetParking in Park: $6 for the shortest hike, park in the most upper lotPicnicking and BBQs available/BathroomsDogs: on leashOn this hike, you will enjoy the many trees and heavy vegetation along the path following the adjacent stream. The Canyon is beautiful. There is one area where the path becomes narrow for people passing each other but there is room to stand to the side if you plan for it. At the end is a beautiful waterfall. We have gone twice in June and the water was still running. The hike is popular so plan on other people and pups along the route. The second time we grilled some hotdogs in the park and a bear showed up not 25 yards from us to dig into trash left by other picnickers. He wasn’t threating and didn’t appear afraid or agitated by people but to be on the safe side, we called the rangers and packed up.See more at simonemcfarland.com",Simone McFarland Travel
50,Easy Relaxing Hike,"My friend and her son and I hiked on a cloudy day. Perfect day to hike because it wasn't hot. Lots of people because it is a popular place for everyone (family with children, people with their dogs, solo hikers, good friends etc.) You may park inside but you will have to pay a fee of $5. I say it's best to park on the street as there are plenty of spaces to park ( people come and go, so you will most likely find a place to park). Also, parking on the street would add to your needed steps as oppose to parking inside. The park is clean with clear trails to follow (plus you will meet people along the way, so just follow them). Lots of trees and plants and brooks along the way. The beauty about this park is that you can stop and sit on one of the big rocks to catch your breath, or just to enjoy the view. We did see a couple of interesting birds along the way. It is 2 miles to get to the itty-bitty waterfalls from the post. It is a nice place to take pictures with your friends and family and to get wet on the itty-bitty water falls :-). We enjoyed our hike!",annminky

Thought one day why kot give it a try saves me the drive to Pasadena. It's about a 15 min drive up there from where I live. 5$parking fee, but you can park in the residential are (ads about 1 mi..to your trip). We had a great hike took my dog Leo. My sister complained about bugs but I never felt them. The waterfall in the end is small. When I was a kid we would be able to swim in it. Now you're lucky if it reaches your ankle. Sad to see. Over all has become one of my places to frequent on the weekends. If you are a local definitely a must do.",viancaluceroc

50,Perfect Short Hike with Gorgeous Views,"This is a simple and enjoyable hike within Monrovia City Limits. The price to park is $6 cash on weekends and $5 cash on weekdays. We live a few miles away so sometimes we walk from our home but other times we like to support the city and simply park and pay. We’ve ran the trail from the lot to the falls in 12 minutes, jogged in 15 and walked at a slower pace at 20 minutes. The trees and environment are very similar to Oak Creek in AZ and the trail is not too crowded if you get there around 7 am or around 4 in the afternoon.",Jolynne V
40,Great little hike right in the backyard!,"Monrovia canyon is a great way to spend a cheap but fun weekend! We love coming to the canyon when we have a free day over the weekend. There are plenty of different trails for all skill levels. We prefer the trails down to the waterfall, as well as the trail up to the top of one of the mountains. There’s something for everyone! We also really like it since it’s rather “off the beaten path” so it’s a hike that doesn’t often get bogged down by tourists!",Lizzy
40,Fantastic Hiking & Mountain Biking Opportunities,"We live just outside the park. For a long time, this was a fantastic little secret but those days appear to be over. The Park itself is excellent, with a great staff and fantastic hiking and mountain biking opportunities. My only reason for a Very Good rating vs. Excellent is that the secret is out, and the park can be quite crowded on the weekend. In addition, with the new found popularity there are folks that need to come up to speed on the rules and trail etiquette. A few things to know:- The Hiking opportunities are wonderful, with the Bill Cull Trail from the Entrance Station to the main waterfall trail; the Cunningham Overlook trail which spurs off the Bill Cull trail for 0.5-mile and about 300-foot climb (it is not a loop, it is an ""up & down""; the trail to the Monrovia Canyon Waterfall, and for more intrepid hikers, the Ben Overturff trail which forks of the main fire road that goes past the Dam and the TRASK Boy Scout Camp. You can always hike the fire road as well, but be mindful of Mountain Bikers and the occasional Equestrians.- The single track trails in this Park are closed to mountains bikes. I am an avid mountain biker but the restriction makes perfect sense. The trails are too narrow with too much hiker traffic. Please don't flaunt this prohibition.The fire road that goes up past the TRASK Boy Scout camp and up to White Saddle is great for bicycling (and hiking) and you can actually get all the way up to the Redbox-Rincon fire road, and from there, much of the San Gabriel's are accessible.- This is not a dog park, dog's need to be on-leash (per park rules, as well as common sense). My wife and I hike every weekend to the Falls with our dog and it is wonderful, but recently, I've encountered more off-leash dogs. The trails are too narrow for this. It allows unfortunate incidents with fearful or aggressive dogs, and, there are hikers that are fearful of dogs (no matter how friendly). If someone gets scared off the trail, the fall can be quite severe. Bring your canine companions, but bring them on leash and keep them under control.- This is a great park for families. There is a Nature Center open on the weekends, a large picnic area up a Fireman Flats, and the trails are very well maintained. However, on the narrower trails (such as the hike to the waterfall), plan to have your children walk, or be carried. The single track trails do not accommodate wheeled strollers. You may be able to take them part way to the Falls, but you will need to leave them for the last mile or so.- You can park in the Park for a fee, although a lot of folks do street parking outside the Park, and walk in. Note that there are several marked areas on the Streets where permits are required to park. If you don't have a permit, do not be surprised if you get a ticket. While Parking Enforcement isn't out every weekend, they do come out.Also be aware of the nearby Lower Clamshell Trail for addtional hiking and bicycling opportunities. It is located off Ridgeside Drive and generally less utilized than Monrovia Canyon Park (although MCP offers much more shade for many of its trails).",David H
50,Monrovia Canyon Park,"A little bit of heaven, here in Monrovia. Not far from the center of the City, you escape into the wilderness.

40,"Easy hike, great for kids","We parked at the upper parking lot and took our cub scouts on a hike up the easy and short trail to the waterfall. The trail can get busy at times, but it is worth the hike to get to the waterfall that always seems to have water in it. Not good for strollers or wheelchairs, but my three year old made the hike. Just get there early as the parking fills up fast. The nature center was also a big hit. Well done Monrovia!",Gary I
30,Sunny fun in Monrovia,"So much fun and worth the five dollars to enter. Canyon Park has my vote and 80 acres with waterfalls await. Monrovia Canyon Park is a small, 80-acre park that sits just outside the boundaries of the Angeles National Forest in the foothills of the San Gabriels Mountains.Do check out the Sawpit Dam its 147-foot tall and orchestrated in 1927 (flood control dam) yet engineers discovered the foundation under dam was too weak to hold the water it was designed for. The reservoir behind it was never filled to capacity because it wouldn’t have withstood an earthquake. As a result the DPW--- Department of Public Works--- turned it into a free-flowing waterfall by cutting a notch into it.Worth a visit and the views from hiking trails are wonderful.",India C

50,"Nice hike for the family, but watch out for the bears","We were looking for an activity that would be appropriate for the children as well as the seniors and this park filled the bill. We parked by the entrance and took the Bill Cull trail that connected with the Falls trail. A very pleasant hike and not too steep. We got to the falls, took lots of selfies and ate our snacks.On the way back down the trail we encountered a bear with two cubs in the middle of the trail. We backed away but made the bear aware of our presence. She looked our way, but obviously didn't view us as a threat as she just ambled off to the side while her cubs climbed up and down trees. Eventually she moved away and gave us an opportunity to proceed down the trail.I live in Montana and the irony that I had to travel all the way to Southern California to see a bear in the wild was not lost on any of us.We had a wonderful hike and I would recommend this activity to anyone who wants a break from city life.",CharlesS916
50,One of the easiest hiking trail,"This is a level 3 trail, there are several trail in the park. I would choose the one goes to the waterfall.

40,Great trail for the family,"There are two hikes. One goes to the waterfall and crosses the stream. The waterfall condition depends on how much rain we get in Monrovia.

It goes up to twin springs and an old hotel foundation and if you are a moderate hiker you can go up to White Saddle which is a good hike.$6 parking, but if you park on the street it is free but an extra .5 miles to the falls.

Monrovia does a great job of caring for and presenting this opportunity to enjoy our beautiful canyon.",CLN49
50,Good family hike,Took my grandson who is 4 and he handled it great. Not too uphill and a lot of level spots to walk. The stream was nice to walk along. Only problem was the bear that kept hanging around Do not take Cheetos or Doritos or anything that's a snack and carry it in your hand. We saw a lot of kids and parents carrying food up to the waterfall. Not a good idea. All in all the park is so close to city life you can see why bears are all over Monrovia. Great place to visit.,Mike G
50,First hike with bionic hip,"Been out of activity commission recuperating, but on 3 month anniversary of hip replacement it was time for a hike to the waterfall at Monrovia Canyon Park.There are hikes for all ages and abilities. You can choose to walk most of the way to the falls on pavement or choose one of three 1-2 mile hikes. We took the longer route, Switchbacks on the Bill Cull Trail, a second segment called the Guided Nature Trail, with informational stops you need a brochure to interpret, and the Falls Trail itself.Took an hour up, 50 minutes down, but you can park higher up at the visitor center for a hike of less than an hour, or a visit . There are picnic tables and benches sprinkled around.A beautiful park, with miles of trails, a ranger station, visitor center, lodge for party rental, a creek, riparian terrain, granite cliffs, and a nice two-segment waterfall less than five miles from home. That's priceless! Parking $5, and at capacity, cars have to wait to get in, so on a pretty day, arrive early, or park before the park entrance....",astrojane

50,Great Family Hike with the kids,Monrovia Falls is an excellent starter hike where our kids 7 & 9 years of age enjoyed very much. There is a nature center at the start of the hike with adjacent parking (you will want to park there) where the center has stuff and live animals to view as well as a large map to see where you are hiking. Park rangers are on hand to answer questions. Less than a two mile hike round trip and you actually end up at a water fall. A very gradual up slope hike to the falls but then afterwards your heading back down hill. Recommendation is to be at Monrovia Canyon Park before 9:30 am to get parking next to the nature center. Enjoy.,RoadTripDave
50,Nice hike,the goal was to get to the waterfall. The trek is inclined with some pretty narrow paths against some steep drops. This hike is not for the novice.,michaelegray01

There is all kinds of nature to see and the waterfall is peaceful and attracts a lot of visitors. There are 3 lots in which to park (lower, middle, and upper). For a hard climb, park at the lower lots. For a relatively easy hike, you can park at the upper lot.",Megan Vick
40,Easy hike to waterfall,"There is plenty of parking just before the entrance and you'll get more of a workout by starting there. But if you choose to park inside there is a $6 parking fee. It's not a very long or strenuous trek to the waterfall. And it wasn't too impressive but hey, CA is in a drought. There is a small but decent nature center just before the trail that's worth a look. Bathrooms just before the trail and also by the nature center. Bring your camera, kids and pets.",Cristina C
50,A Waterfall even for Little Ones,"The family wanted to see a waterfall after the awesome rains this January, but between everyone going, we didn't have the time or the ability for a hike up into the San Gabriels or San Bernardino Mts. This hike was perfect! We did the 3/4 mile hike from the Nature Center. It took about an hour, and I am definitely bringing nephews/nieces here the next time they are in town - even little ones would not be over taxed. If I was going for exercise, I would start at the bottom of the park and walk up the trails to the nature center, instead of driving up.At the entrance to the park there is a little box where you get out a numbered envelope with a detachable tab, which has a matching number. You put $5 in the envelope, tear off the tab and put it on your dash, then put the part with the money in the slot. Very handy. I love the honor system.The trail between the nature center and the falls is very well maintained, wide, and safe. You could almost take a trail stroller on this hike except there are a few places where the path becomes only 1 person wide. Also there is some light climbing/descending that would be bumpy, and there are two small creek crossings. I was especially pleased with the creek crossings - some in our party would not have appreciated getting wet, but the stepping stones were wide and plentiful enough that I was able to stand off to the side on the extra stones and help our slow member across. If I was bringing a toddler, I think it would be reasonable to expect them to walk - the hike was that mild. At worst, I would wear a kid-pack for a toddler to sit in in case of melt-down.The bathroom at the nature center was clean and well maintained and OPEN, even though the nature center, itself was closed. Our hike was on a non-holiday Monday, so I was surprised to see perhaps a dozen other people on the trail, including a lot of locals walking their dogs. On a busy weekend, I don't know whether it would be overly crowded. If I go again, I will pick another week day.The falls at the end are only a few feet wide and 20 ft high or so - this is not a big falls, but it was nice.",Michael P

This is a nice park in Monrovia, if one goes for a hike there is a nice waterfall to also see.This area also has a bear population. In the nearby housing area, I have sat in my car and enjoyed watching mom bears and their cubs going from trash can to next can on trash pick up day. I assume the bears think of those cans as nice picnic baskets.As such, enjoy the park, but do be aware that there have also been bear sitings in the area.",mini

Trailing stream, overhanging branches, rock outcroppings and the quiet all made for a restorative experience. I am an East Coast gal and am used to hikes that end in an overlook. Monrovia Canyon ends in a waterfall and I really enjoyed that. I would definitely hike this again. Easy to park. Clear map.",Marcia2424
50,Gorgeous park with first class amenities and a year round waterfall,"Between the courteous, hard working staff and an army of dedicated volunteers, this small park is kept up beyond anything you might expect. It has a wonderful nature center, a cabin that can be rented along with picnic areas. Its most popular trail is a short but wonderful trail through a beautiful canyon along a stream to a year round running waterfall. The trails are immaculate thanks to the a fore mentioned staff and volunteers. For those who want more strenuous hikes, there is a longer version of the waterfall hike that starts at the entrance and has some climb and views as it parallels the entrance road. For a much more strenuous hike - try the Ben Overturff trail. The start is along an access road to a Boy Scout camp and then you mostly hike upwards on a trail that takes you deeper into the San Gabriel mountains and into LA Forest area, including a stream crossing and lots of beautiful wooded areas. Its very scenic - but in another class than the easy waterfall hike so do be prepared.",Brian U

I watched dozens and dozens of cars turn up and drive away.

We also visited the small nature center there that had information about the ecology of the area and some reptiles and amphibians to look at.the hiking trails looked very good and you can take a .75 mile hike up to a waterfall.",lmg1954
50,"Easy, shady, beautiful Falls Hike","The hike for the waterfall is really easy and short. A small child, pet, or elderly person could complete this hike (my small puppy did just fine). You can determine whether to start at the nature center (only 0.75 mile one way) or from a further distance like the cabin. The majority of the trail is shaded and runs along the creek. Its very nice! Once you get to the waterfall, it is very nice and peaceful too.This hike is also one of the cleanest ones I've done. Almost no dog poop and graffiti like others nearby but this may be due to the fact that they charge $5 for parking and have rangers/volunteers.At the nature center there are also picnic tables for you to have a picnic before or after your hike as well as bathrooms.Definitely will return.",MandMsRED3
40,Easy hike,"There are few trails: Waterfall, Ben overturff, Twinspring. There are poison oaks (leaves of three, let it be!) Ticks are common and rattlesnakes, so be careful. The trail that takes you to the waterfall has lots of shade.Parking is $5 (there are 3 different parking lots). Bathrooms are available by the parking lots.Driving direction: off the 210 FWY, exit Myrtle Ave, drive through old town Monrovia towards Foothill Blvd., turn Right, go two lights to Canyon Blvd., turn Left, drive through residential area stay on your Right into Canyon Park and follow the sign.The trail to the waterfall is very easy and short (about 2 mi. RT). The other Trails on the right side of the first parking lot is harder.",orcaandbeluga
