10,Very Underwhelming,"The moment you see the attracttion takes place in a bus with other 25 people you knew it couldnt be anything exciting(kongs great though). Youd think itd be a car roller coaster like Aerosmith in Disney, but nope...a freakn party bus. Anyway...theres simply no thrill and excitement to the ride and once you peek out of the bus and see youre stationary it totally loses any sort of immersion. The only ride in Universal I was dissapointed with and by far the worst. Hope its a short lived ride and for better testing and feedback for next rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juancarlosaA2276MY
10,Do not go on this ride,"Everything about this ride is terrible, the build up, the character interactions, the stroyline and then the ride itself. How they made a ride this bad is beyond me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminJG32
10,Lazy Wasted Potential,"Waste of Universal's money and talent, they could have done much better.First off, this ride is exactly like Kong at IOA next door, except themed as F&F. I like these movies (I'll admit it, they're a guilty pleasure.) The execution of this ride can be summed up in one word: LAZY. Universal (or maybe new Comcast folk) probably thought, ""Hmm, what can we capitalize on, spend as little money on as possible, and ensure a high rider capacity? A lazy projection tunnel that a bus parks in!!! PERFECT!"" ...No... This attraction could have been something pretty fun. Take the ride tech for Transformers or Spiderman and create an experience like that. See I've noticed that people don't mind simulations, they mind being treated like morons. At least with the aforementioned attractions, there is some thought, theming, scenery, and motion going from scene to scene. As mentioned, F&F Supercharged is just lazy. If Universal really wanted to create something special, then they would have created a ride similar to Epcot's Test Track or California Adventure's Cars Ride and theme it appropriately...now that would have been an awesome 5-star attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HNTRSTNG
10,At least we were laughing....,So my friend is not a ride person but I convinced her to go on this ride because I had heard it was terrible. My mom also doesn't love fast and furious but I convinced her to come join in the comedy.I kid you not when I say this is literally the worst ride I've ever experienced. You get in a bus thats its... you literally ride a bus and there is a screen. The dialogue is cheesy in classic Fast and Furious Style - at times a little painful. I think the funniest part about this is that at one point Vin Diesel is the same size as a helicopter that he is holding on to.Honestly if you do go on it go in with a very low expectation and just have fun like my friend and I did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28karas
10,The only ride we didn’t go on more than once,"The queue to this ride is good, lots of interesting cars to look at etc...You are loaded onto a big bus (similar to the Skull Island ride in Islands of Adventure) and you wear 3D glasses.The ride isn’t very long, the plot isn’t that interesting and not much happens to be honest. We were quite underwhelmed afterwards and probably won’t go on it ever again. I don’t think we can say that about any other ride we have been on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemUKLondon
10,Utter rubbish,"This ride was the only on in an action packed 2 week holiday we were disappointed in. We had to get tickets for a virtual queue first, so after mooching around waiting as there was nothing nearby that fitted into the time frame we were finally admitted only to have to queue for well over another hour!We have not seen any fast and furious films so may have been at a disadvantage but I am fairly sure most die hard fans would cringe at the backstory to this ride- basically being chased in a party bus by someone called Sean and being reminded that ‘family come first’ every few minutes.The main issue with the ride is not the action going on either side but that is all there is. Other rides that use a lot of screens combine it with some animated models such as in Kong. We just felt we were having a bumpy ride in a bus whilst screened either side of us played a very loud, shouty video at us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahfU554QO
20,Meet Up and mini vacation,Okay the que was awesome. Loved the car's on display but the ride was just okay. One of my friends daughter kept yelling at the holograms saying hi and she was upset the holograms would not talk back to her,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196cynthiap
20,"F&F lite, or is that F&F zero??","After all the hype of the new ride. This was the one I had to ride in 2018. For a new ride the standby line was only 30 minutes. The Pre Ride display is cheap and liked more like a military surplus centre than what was supposed to be a garage. All the cars are shadow copies not an original screen car to be seen And even these seemed to be of poor quality. Crashed cars from one of the eight movies would have been better The pre show which while entertaining only showed how cheaply this ride had been thrown together. All the performance of the live and recorded “film actors” was more wooden than Pinocchio on shrek4d. Obviously, all ""talent"" was shot separately and then edited together. Then onto the ride built to do only one thing get as many through the ride as possible. The “buses” were filled 5 wide so the person in the middle have a very poor view. The party scene was classic F&F . Then. More wooden acting. And what has to be the shortest and most ridiculously fashioned chase scene. In conclusions poor ride for one of the longest-running car film franchises. It was almost like the theme parks are mocking the movies. In comparison the “Back to the future” ride was far better when that was released all those years ago. You would have thought with a decade on of technological updates. It would have pushed the interactive envelope further. or perhaps had spoken to a few petrol heads before putting the ride together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Willger
40,High Quality 3D experience,This ride felt like you were driving on the freeway at many points. The dance party wasn't that exciting but the escape was highly entertaining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
40,Very good attraction,Another 4-D special effect show. Made you feel like you were a part of the F + F crew. Really good effects. Fun and interesting storyline. Nice going into the Sullivans workshop :) Really enjoyed it. It is a part of the studio tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
40,Very good 360 3D,The Fast and Furious - Supercharged attraction is a 360 3D ride with the bus. The special effects are amazing and you think that you are in the movie along with Vin Diesel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
40,"Amazing Special Effects, and you really feel the flight!","***DO YOUR HOME WORK BEFORE YOU GO!!! Find out what this studio has met to the history of Hollywood! The things that happened here are extraordinary!Not a big fan of the giant 4D things, however this is a ton of fun! A great finish to the Tour. Dont miss the Studio Tour, it is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB336
