50,My kids and I love this place!,My kids and I love this place! Super friendly owner and staff. Calm environment. The one thing I love about this place the most is how clean and neat everything is! I've been to other playgrounds and nothing compares to this place. I will be doing my sons 2nd birthday here! Highly recommend this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisamla25
