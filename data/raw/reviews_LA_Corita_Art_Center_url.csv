40,Colorful art with a message in an off-the-beaten-track gallery,"This free gallery showcases the work of Mary Corita Kent, a sister of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, who created vibrant pop art serigraphs exploring the themes of social justice, peace, tolerance, and faith.When we went, the two dozen or so prints were displayed in an office hallway, not a traditional gallery. It was an unusual setting, but a surprisingly relaxed one, with only the occasional employee rushing by on urgent business. We had the gallery to ourselves and meditated on each work as long as we liked. The work is colorful, thought-provoking, and worth the time.Since this is an untraditional gallery it’s important to set one’s expectations: Corita's most recognizable pieces were not on view (Wonder Bread, for example, or The big G stands for Goodn); there weren't placards for individual prints, so occasionally we were stumped by Corita’s handwriting; and we would’ve liked to have made more purchases based on our favorite works, but the gift shop had a surprisingly limited selection — a missed opportunity.Still, apart from these quibbles, we enjoyed this off-the-beaten-track gallery and the chance it gave us to learn about this under-appreciated, intriguing artist.The Corita Art Center is down the road from Fern Dell. From Los Feliz, turn right into the free parking lot just before Franklin. The Corita Art Center is to the left past the booth. Small cars recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcQ9971DR
