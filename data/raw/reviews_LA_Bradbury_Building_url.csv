50,Stunning!,"I did a very quick visit here years ago, but was thrilled to come back again. This is a truly special building, which is why it has appeared in many movies and TV shows. My fav was ""Demon With A Glass Hand,"" an original Outer Limits episode with Robert Culp. I saw that show over 50 years ago and even then was enthralled by the location. You can only go on the ground floor and up the stairs to the first level, but that is enough to let you understand how beautiful this place is. Read the history, which is fascinating as well. It's open on the weekends and you'll have more of a chance to nab a parking spot on the street then, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/overeasy

40,A Nice Place to Visit,"We had heard and seen photos of the Bradbury Building on different LA travel blogs and planned a stop to visit first hand. The interior is as amazing as the photos you see online. There was no charge to visit and see the interior of the building from the first floor. There is a security person stationed there who enforces the no professional camera policy.They have a list of photography rules posted of which states that nothing other than a smart phone is allowed for photography. Other items on the list include no shooting of wedding photography and no on site changing of clothes (can't imagine how that made the list) lol! Sounds kind of crazy. They do allow you to go up to the top of the first flight of starts in the rear of the lobby but no further. Elevators are out of service for use by the public. There is a Subway on site at the front of the building which made the entire area smell like Subway sandwiches. We enjoyed the visit but wish more of the building was open to see, even if it meant a nominal charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs

50,An architectural jewel in DTLA,"I discovered this place initially after researching Blade Runner's settings (my favorite film) but I keep coming back whenever I am in downtown LA just to soak in the ambience and enjoy the atmosphere. Going into the Bradbury is like entering a cathedral. You don't want to speak too loudly. The interior just takes your breath away. Visitors are only allowed in the lobby and up to the first landing, but that is enough. The wrought ironwork, the shafts of light, the mix of materials all create architectural magic that I have experienced in very few places in the world. This place is a must for film and design fans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyledda

The guards welcome visitors into the atrium and partially up the stairway for photographs.When friends visit Los Angeles I began with Angels Flight, wander the Grand Central Market and finish with the Bradbury Building. It’s always fun to watch their jaw dropping expressing upon entering the building.Years ago, when the building was in decline, one could ride the ornate elevator to the upper floors. Now visitors are welcomed in to gawk, enjoy, and experience the fascinating architectural wonder.",
40,Right out of a movie scene,"Located just across central market in downtown LA, the Bradbury cant be missed with its brick colored facade. Didn't have any idea what the bldg was about honestly. But as soon as I stepped inside, it was like being in a time capsule out of a scene from the '30s. I also recognized the lift from a scene from 500 days of summer. The place is perfect for photos w/c mgt allows only in the lobby area. However, visitors are advised to keep the noise down as it still is a functional office building.",
50,AMAZING spot for photography and to take in the architecture,"Absolutely amazing place that truly makes you feel like you’re in another world. If you’ve seen blade runner, the iconic stairway scene was filmed here. I’d actually never paid attention to that. I mainly came here because of all the shots I’d seen of it online. None of them do if justice. If you’re in DTLA, check it out. It’s free and a nice place for some amazing architecture shots.",
40,Lovely example of yesteryear architecture,Only the downstairs entrance foyer can be accessed by the public as the upper floors are actual office areas for businesses.

40,"Beautiful architecture, feels like timetraveling but not much to see","I didn't realize I'd been in the Bradbury Building before - many times actually since the Blue Bottle across from Grand Central market is actually in the building. Once in the atrium of the Bradbury Building, you can't actually go up any of the stairs or elevators, which is kind of a bummer. However, the aesthetic inside is beautiful and a photographer's dream. You probably don't need to spend more than 5 minutes inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElJefesCafe

40,Must go inside!,"On many walking tours of LA everyone stops outside the famous Bradbury Building. Please take the time to walk inside. It was built in 1893 and has gorgeous skylit ceilings and the walkways, marble stairs and elevators are beautiful. The building is a National Historic Landmark since 1977. The gold-mining millionaire, Lewis Bradbury, built it. The Italian Renaissance Revival style was popular at the time of construction. It is 5 stories and includes cast iron stair rails, tiling, marble, terra cotta, polished wood and natural light. You may not go on the second floor unless you work in the building. The elevators are hand driven and you must be careful to land on the right spot since it's not automatic. It is close to the Grand Central Market, Angels' Flight and the Million Dollar Theatre (Sid Grauman's palace.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hildmat
40,Quick stop for some great architecture,"Stopped in to take some pics of the really cool architecture. As others note, you can only go as far as the 2nd floor landing, but it’s all good.Watched a photo shoot inish up as we were arriving.",
50,Beautiful building worth the visit,"I've been aware of the Bradbury Building since the early 80's when I first saw it in Blade Runner then in the 90's with music videos using the location. I finally got to see the building for myself and it was amazing. The building is open to the public, but you can't access all parts unless you are doing business. that said it is still worth a stop when you are downtown",
40,Architectures Dream.,This building is right across Grand Central Market in LA- from the outside looks very ordinary but once you walk in is breathtaking. It has actually been the set to a few films. Worth checking it out.,
40,I have never watched Blade Runner,"Even though, it is a very interesting and beautiful building. I was lucky enough to see the rooftop. Some security man are rude. I know it is a commercial building but it is still with touristic appeal.",
50,Iconic Building in Downtown,It is worth stopping by to see the iconic interior of a relatively non-descript building. You can hang out and grab a few pictures and then head across the street to the market for some food.,
40,Must visit for Blade Runner fans,"Bradbury Building is a key location in the original Blade Runner, so fans of the movie should make this part of their pilgrimage tour. And in case if you're not a fan, there's a mounted excerpt from a book that displays the building's relevance to the seminal cyberpunk movie.Admission is free but unfortunately, entry is just restricted to the first floor and up to the second floor landing during most days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hizonfire

50,Devine Architecture!,"We visited the Bradbury Building today.You can only visit the ground floor and the first floor viewing platform as it’s still a functional building with business’.The architecture is is just devine! I just love the cage elevators and all the photo opportunities. The wrought iron work is gorgeous.We only stayed about 10 minutes. That’s all you need really.Entry is free and you don’t need to book specific dates/times. You just arrive and enter the building. They request you keep noise to a minimum to as not disturb the operating business’, which is understandable.If you are in to history and beautiful architecture, I highly recommend a visit :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiggerqueensland
40,Aesthetic architectural excellence,"The Bradbury Building located at South Broadway, right across from Grand Central Market in Downtown Los Angeles is an architectural landmark dating back to 1893! Its architectural style is a combination of Romanesque Revival and Victorian. Commissioned by gold mining millionaire Lewis L Bradbury it was designed by prominent architect Sumner P Hunt.The story goes that after Hunt had finalized the plans for the building, Bradbury visited his office. While leaving, the millionaire noticed Hunt’s young draftsman George H Wyman who at the time had no worthwhile training or experience as an architect – but for some inexplicable reason, that did not stop Bradbury from quirkily offering Wyman the chance to supervise the construction of the only building that would carry his name!Wyman apparently constructed the building as per Sumner Hunt’s original design. Not unsurprisingly, after the Bradbury Building, Wyman’s career was not marked by any notable architectural achievements or professional acclaim! However, even today, the identity of the building’s actual architect still remains a matter of debate.It is said that Wyman was strongly influenced by Edward Bellamy’s 1887 book “Looking Backward”, while constructing the Bradbury Building. In that book, the average commercial building is described as a “vast hall full of light, received not alone from the windows on all sides, but from the dome, the point of which was a hundred feet above … The walls were frescoed in mellow tints, to soften without absorbing the light which flooded the interior.” The similarities to the Bradbury are uncanny.The Bradbury Building’s Italian Renaissance style exterior is done with a mixture of sandstone and brown brick with panels of terracotta detailing. The traditional, rather plain, mildly Romanesque exterior offers not a hint of its magnificent interior. The entrance to the building is through a large arched wooden door with rectangular glass panels.The most striking feature of the five-storey building’s interior is its skylit atrium – sunlight streams into a beautiful Victorian central courtyard from a skylight about fifty feet above. A seamless architectural composition that features open birdcage glazed elevators enclosed by wrought iron grillwork from France, dramatic lift towers, patterned Italian marble staircases, ornamental wrought iron staircase handrails and walkway railings from France, polished wood, the largest plate glass windows in Los Angeles at that time. The central court has pastel glazed brick walls, Mexican floor tiles, geometric patterned staircases at all ends.The Bradbury interior truly is aesthetic architectural excellence. That came at a huge cost – started with an initial estimate of $175,000, the building finally cost over $500,000, an astronomical amount for those days. Undaunted by the cost, Bradbury spared no expense in the construction of this magnificent building. However, in an ironic twist of fate, Lewis Bradbury died a few months before the building opened in 1893.The elevators of the building still work and go all the way to the fifth floor, but only tenants are allowed to use it. Visitors can only go up to the first level of the stairs. Security personnel man the ground level central courtyard as it is still used as a commercial building. Admission to the building is free.In recent years, the timeless Bradbury Building at Broadway and Third Street was in focus for its prominent appearance in the movie “The Blade Runner”. It is listed in both the National Register of Historic Places (1971) and has been designated a National Historic Landmark (1977).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
40,Cool To Visit,Downtown has changed a lot in last few years. I came down here to take a wander around just to see some of the changes. Right on Broadway it's worth taking a peek inside the Bradbury. The inside is pretty iconic. Seen in many movies it's a sight to behold. You can walk up to the first landing but that's it. The rest is still a working office building so out of respect to the tenants they keep the visitors to the ground floor and landing. I believe they have tours you can take that might be worth it. But just popping in for a few minutes to see will probably satisfy your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms

50,Love the Architecture,My son and I are fans of the TV show Bosch and Titus Welliver who plays the main character. The guard was very pleasant and informative. It is a beautiful building and worth the stop if you are in the area. It is very close to Angel's Flight a land mark since 1901.

50,An Iconic Landmark of DTLA,"When you head towards this 1893 building from the outside it doesn’t look like much, just a regular-looking brick building with a Subway store on the ground floor. But in a classic case of “don’t judge a book by its cover” you walk through the entrance and go down a narrow but open hallway, finding yourself in awe by your surroundings.The iron railings, glass ceiling, stone carvings, and vintage elevators give this atrium space so much historic and aesthetic charm that nobody would know about had everyone just driven by the building and not thought about it. The filmmakers who brought us Blade Runner obviously recognized this building’s beauty and importance when they chose to use it as a prominent film location for the movie.Because this is still used as a commercial building where people work, you can only go up to the first level of stairs but you can still get some great shots there.

The use of wood and iron in the large interior atrium is spectacular. It is beautifully designed and is still all functional, including the old elevator.

40,Gorgeous,"You could easily miss this building as you walk along S Broadway as it is quite unassuming. Once inside, however, it's stunning. The iron rails and elevator are right out of an early movie. Unfortunately, you can only walk up one flight of stairs for another perspective (at either end), and you can't use the elevator or go any higher. Nevertheless, worth taking a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie
40,Wow... what an architechtural treat.,"Well little did I know at the time, that this was the building where Titanic was filmed and also Justin Timberlakes (JT's) latest song 'Say Something' was filmed in one take. The building is fairly plain on the outside but once you go inside it's a treat for the eyes. You can't access anything but the lowest level, and you will see the longest telegram box in the world. It's an awesome building and well worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merilyn_S_12

40,An architectural gem in downtown LA,"From the outside, the Bradbury Building does not really look too outstanding as it looks rather plain, however, the appearance and upkeep is very good. It is the Bradbury Building interior that is really unique. The building has a beautiful atrium and has some intricate iron work that is a wonder to observe. Natural light floods the interior from the glass roof and you can stand and admire no matter where you look. It's free to enter but you can only observe from below as you cannot go up into the occupied upper floors which are for tenants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

They're used to tourists wandering through, and tourists are welcome to explore the main floor lobby and a little area just off the main lobby floor (for a different view). Its open cage elevators, marble stairs, and iron railings are something to behold.

50,Amazing!,"I was able to experience the Bradbury Building during the filming of the movie, ""Bladerunner."" I was one of hundreds of people who worked behind the scenes during the filming of the movie and got to see the building in ways that tourists do not. It is an amazing Victorian holdover that was almost lost but thank goodness is now on the historic register. If you have the opportunity to visit the Bradbury Building, I highly advise it.

We were surprised that it is open 7 days per week during the day. We went on a Sunday morning. The lobby and interior with staircases, iron railings and skylights are every bit as we remembered them from the movies. Clean, well lit, very photographable. Unfortunately only the first floor and halfway up one staircase are accessible to the public, probably due to security and the lack of tenants in the building. It is amazing, due to the lack of occupants, that the building is still accessible at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2bears93442
30,Cool building,I wouldn't make a special trip to visit this building but if you are in the area you should definitely stop by. It will take 5 mins. Tourists can't go any farther than a specific first floor landing. You can eat at The Grand Central Market to make it worth your while. It is downtown so some blocks smelled of urine but there weren't too many homeless to bother you. They pretty much kept to themselves and didn't ask us for anything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodiS145

40,"Calm, peaceful and great for photographers","If you are a photographer, this is a fantastic place to capture a shot of history. Gaze up and marvel at five stories of staircases and their cast iron railings that contrast with highly polished wood. You can walk in this central atrium but are not allowed in the very decorative birdcage lift (a very stern guard will make sure of this). You can also climb one flight of stairs but no higher as it is roped off at the top. It's a very calm and peaceful place compared to the Grand Central Market opposite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969suziea
30,Limited visability,"I was really excited to see one of the locations for the original BladeRunner. Unfortunantly the area that is viewable by the public is pretty limited.

You might recognize from films such as Blade Runner, and the ending sequence of 500 Days of Summer.The only downside is that you're only allowed up the flight of steps to the first landing.

The building itself dates back to 1893 and is the oldest commercial building in the center city.

50,A definite must for Photographers and Architecture Enthusiasts,"The Bradbury Building has probably one of the most recognizable interiors anywhere in the world, and for a good reason. As soon as you walk into the lobby you are welcomed into a natural light filled space provided by the atrium glass 5 stories above you. The open cage elevators, intricate iron railings, and warm wood design is a perfect blend that compliments every space. The building is still in use by businesses, so if visiting on a weekday please be quiet.

40,Gorgeous Interior Space w/Stunning Wrought Iron,"I live right across the street from The Bradbury. The interior is so surprising compared to the relatively plain exterior, but don't be fooled. It's a beauty well worth visiting. It transports me back to the days when I lived in Paris and worked in a creative filed in which I had to visit many artists and climbed into various elegant wrought iron elevators in order to get to my final destination. Beautiful light permeates, and the detail of the iron work is breathtaking. If you visit The Bradbury, you might want to also at least see the exterior of The Douglas building across the street which was built in 1893 by the guy named Douglas, a lumber tycoon, after whom Douglas Fir tress were named.

40,The Real Thing From Several Films,"The Bradbury Building has been used as a location for many movie and television shows, most notably ""Blade Runner."" When we visited, it was slated to be a location for ""Scandal."" The nineteenth century building has an unassuming facade, but inside its open lobby, wrought iron decoration, cage elevators and large glass atrium make the building unique. You can only visit the lobby and go up a flight of stairs; the rest of the building has actual offices in it, but since it is directly across from the hopping Grand Central Market (worth a trip all by itself) it is a great detour at the end of a lunch trip in Downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsY4447RO

40,Blade Runner Fans will be in heaven!,"The Bradbury Building will be interesting to architecture buffs, but especially thrilling to fans of the movie Blade Runner! The intricate metalwork railings and balustrades along with the large central skylight lends an eerie dystopian quality to the atmosphere. The building is only accessible on the ground floor so it makes for a quick visit. The added bonus is that other movies were shot here, and the building is located across from Grand Central Market, a mecca for foodies! Even though Eggslut is no longer open, there are other wonderful new food vendors to explore, as well as beloved, long-term original food stands. Even though it is no longer operating, a peek at the Angel's Flight tramway is worth a look on the back side of the market since it was in the movie La La Land. And the 2nd and 3rd street tunnels are also popular movie locations. Be prepared for a little bit of L.A. city grit, this downtown area is the opposite of Beverly Hills but still well worth a bit of edgy exploration!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjjSD

50,The building that the occult helped bring alive,"Los Angeles, 1893. When planchette boards and ouija boards were widely accepted as a means of communication and messages thus received were acted upon.Lewis Bradbury, the mining magnate cum real estate developer, desired a monument to his name. He had the land, he had the wealth…but he did not have an architect. The architect he approached, Sumner Hunt, disappointed in his plans. Bradbury then turned to Hunt’s assistant, George Wyman. Wyman felt the offer was unprofessional, and refused. Until, one Saturday evening he sat down at the planchette board. He received a message from his brother Mark, dead six years. “Take Bradbury Building. It will make you famous.” So he did. And created this architecturally perfect treasure that still stands as monument to both Bradbury and Wyman himself.In the midst of bustling downtown LA is this nondescript brown-door exterior. Step in. You are in a quiet, light filled space, an atrium five-storeys high. An apt tribute to the famous California sunlight, illuminating Italian marble, Mexican floor-tiles and French wrought-iron grillwork, all put together with mathematical precision.Entry is free. The visit is short. Visitors are allowed only into the first level (the other levels are office space.) Walk around and admire the delicate fretwork, the two free-standing mail chutes, the two water-powered elevators. Look upwards to the wonderfully arranged staircase. And when you are done, cross the road to Grand Central Market and choose, from a bewildering variety, a most satisfying meal. And think that the building you just walked through was the site of many a Hollywood film, the most famous of which is Blade Runner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1flytheskies

You could also take a short 4 to 5 block walk and look at the Oviatt Building at 617 South Olive Street, one of the finest examples of Art Deco in Los Angeles. Three more of my favorite downtown buildings are:The Coca Cola building, (this is called Streamline Architecture) which looks like a docked huge ocean liner...at 1334 South Central Avenue at Pico Blvd.Union Station...800 North Alameda Street. Another great Art Deco structure.And for a more contemporary architectural building, you must view, walk around, walk in and walk to the roof area of Frank Gehry's, (in my opinion) sexy and sensual, Walt Disney Concert Hall at 111 South Grand Avenue. Pure genius!I have left out so many other great architectural buildings like the Eastern Columbia building, the Variety Arts Center building, City Hall, many ""Golden Age"" theatre buildings including where my offices and factory were once located on the second and third floors (and mezzanine) of what is now the Ace Hotel.Downtown Los Angeles has seen a dynamic transformation in its architecture since its inception. Please take the time to enjoy such visual treats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryMLosAngeles

50,"If you are a movie fan, or an architect, this is ""must see""","I love Blade Runner, so I had to visit this location. Other Blade Runner locations are in the immediate area, including the ""tunnel"" you see in many movies. This is the crown jewel location. Tourists have access to the ground floor and the stairs going up to the first floor, so you can see all the features of this building. Out the front door you see the Million Dollar Theatre featured in the movie, out the back door you see a 5 storey high mural of Anthony Quinn from Zorba the Greek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddD3505IR

40,Great architectural building in LA city centre,Very beautiful and achitectually interesting old building in LA city centre.You can only visit the first floor since it's still on office use on daily bases. So you also need to keep your voice down while admiring the surroundings. There's many safe guards securing the peaceful working atmosphere. Luckily we managed to park just in front of the building. It was vero easy to find it.Tip: If you go there visit also The old Grand Central Market just opposite side of the road and get a tasty lunch also in a great atmosphere :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holidaytraveller2014
40,The unassuming exterior might fool you.,"Combined with a visit to the Grand Central market. The charm is turning out only when passed through its entrance.

50,"Sleeper outside, fantasyland inside","One of the oldest buildings in downtown Los Angeles (pre-1900), the Bradbury is almost forgettable from the outside, the only items of interest are some stonework and wood doors that somehow have survived fire code upgrades. But walk in and see one of the most ornate interiors in the City, reportedly designed after the architect consulted his dead brother using a Ouija board. It's been a favorite of movie makers from Blade Runner to 500 Days of Summer, and you'll be able to see some of the ways it's been used. Be sure to check through the side door to see the Anthony Quinn mural across the street, then go out the back way and learn about Biddie Mason - my history class never mentioned her, but LA would be a much different place if she hadn't existed. And when you're done, head back across Broadway for lunch at Grand Central Market - it defines cornucopia, both in variety of cuisines and price levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeyGordo
50,Breathtaking Sight,When walking into the building one gets a sense of 1920's type aura. Looking up through the main hall one can see a beautiful rustic set of floors. The elevator alone is worth the trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickperryz

50,I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...,"A must for any Blade Runner fans, yes it's only the lobby of an office block but it's very cool that you can just wander in off the street and be transported to 2019. There's also a fantastic food court in a converted warehouse directly opposite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkK32
40,Beautiful building inside but you almost miss it from the street,It is worth walking through the lobby to view this beautiful historic building which has appeared in many movies. You must keep quiet since it is an active office building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
50,Lovely architecture.,"When in LA, take a walk through this building on your tour of LA as its architecture is classic, as seen in many a movie. The openness of its interior, the use of wrought iron and skylites is amazing to see, touch and feel. An LA landmark that will take you less than an hour if rushed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
40,One of those things,"Go ahead and take a quick peak inside the Bradbury next time you are in the area. Definitely not a destination attraction, but go get some lunch at Grand Central Market across the street and check this place out. This building has been in many movies and commercials over the years and is instantly recognizable once you step in.No professional filming is allowed, and there is a security guard present to keep the on-lookers in order.Unfortunately you are not allowed to explore the upper levels because the building is tenant occupied, but the lobby is still pretty cool. You will probably spend 10 minutes in here at most, but its worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8983VPtimothym

40,"If you like architecture, you will love the Bradbury Building","This is a very impressive old building. You will recognize it from many movies, including Blade Runner. It is a private office building. But they very graciously allow people on the ground floor for a look... and it is worth it!As you exit from the front door be sure to look across the street. You will see the Million Dollar Theater and the Grand Central Market. Notice the facade detail of the theater and then head to the market for lots of good food stands.Finally, the Los Angeles Conservancy offers several walking tours if the downtown area. They are terrific!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneHolmerSmith

40,"If you love architecture, you should visit",Very interesting repurposing of an old building. Loved that the old wood and fixtures were maintained. Couldn't visit the private sections but standing in the hall I got a good sense of the building. A must see for anyone who enjoys architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lpmontreal
40,Step into the 40's at the Bradbury- then eat your way through America at the Central Market,"In this day and age its hard to believe that a building that's used for business and residential purposes is open to everyone without showing your I.D. at the entrance but the Bradbury is open to all for a look-see into the past, before A/C or LED lighting. Its across the street from the Central Market (more about that later) and from the outside its rather undistinguished. But when you open the intricate doors and enter the atrium, ringed with dark metal and wood stairways and hallways that follow the four sides of each floor, you realize that this was ""how they lived and worked in the 40's"", and then it all becomes very, very cool. Go up to the first stairway, stop and take it all in. The light from the ceiling, the sense of proportion, the tenant listings on the wall- its all very pleasing and makes one think of those buildings in Italy with interior courtyards and ancient, wrought iron elevators, the kind that can barely hold 2 people and 2 suitcases and move so slowly. Its old but in a city devoted to the ""hip and happening"" it has a dignity and sensibility you will never find in any one of the glass towers so prevalent in today's cities. Best of all its just steps from the Central Market, a raucous hodgepodge of foods from every group in America. Amble through the aisles, stop at the dried fruits stands, smell the spices that, as the song says, ""come all the way from China"", and brings up such feelings of wonder at the abundance and diversity of our lucky, lucky country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eh2bh2eh
40,Great architecture,"Iconic building downtown. The building is interesting from the outside but amazing inside. It has been used in many movies, to include China Town. You can go in the lobby and to the first floor landing, which is really enough to see the ironwork and intricate design work. Worth a stop if you are downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DogWorld

50,The 1890s wonder,"You visit downtown Los Angeles you must visit this building. Built in 1893 by a famous architect, this charming Jewel is filled with light and historic architecture linked to the Downtown Los Angeles Historic District. It is a truly unique office building. In the lobby there is a door that leads you into a Subway restaurant if you work here and you want to have lunch but you don't want to walk far, just walk downstairs and the subway restaurant is to your left . This should be a travel channel favorite hot spot..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri

40,What a revelation the inside of this building is.,The outside of this building in Downtown is quite unremarkable but inside it's astonishing. It's just an office building but so pleasant with lots of natural light and beautiful iron staircases and galleries. We wouldn't have discovered it were it not on a Downtown LA scavenge hunt.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Otteraswas
40,Nice to Stop By if You're Near,"This is right across from the Grand Central Market, so if you're visiting that this is a good place to just pop in. I went around 3pm on a Sunday and just walked into the building no problem. The architecture is beautiful and famous-- as seen in many films such as 'Blade Runner' and 'The Artist'. From the outside you would never be able to tell. We stayed about 5 minutes to snap some photos. You are allowed to walk on the first floor and partially up the stairs to the second floor.Fun fact-- Marvel has some of their offices in here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/861christinah
40,Like tears in rain…,"It's been a while since I visited here. The day my friend and I arrived, several other tourists ignored the chains and ""Do Not Enter"" signs—after the security guard had kicked them out, we struck up a conversation about the building and its history, Blade Runner (of course), and how the building was being used currently (LAPD Internal Affairs, among other things—!).I'm not saying that he took us on a personal tour of the whole place, up those gorgeous elevators, around the mezzanine levels… but I *would* say some basic politeness and rule-following paid big dividends.It's worth a stop, especially if you're a fan of the architecture or a hardcore Blade Runner nerd (like me).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandersMusic
40,Lovely Architecture!,"A beautiful historic building with iron accent. Famed as the film location for Blade Runner. If you are in the area, it is worth the stop.

50,Inconspicuous from the outside,My partner and I were in Downtown LA and picked up from on the guide s that the building was worth a visit - so glad we did. Its only a short visit as the building is small and easy enough to walk through - many areas are locked from public access but stop by if in the area. Its one of only 4 buildings in downtown LA on the national heritage register and when you step inside the restoration will really impress you - its almost like a cathedral.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenM_11
30,Cool,"I couldn't remember the scene from Blade Runner, so to me it's just a cool building. It's a bit ""hiding in plain sight"" so I did feel like I discovered something when I found it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9236AQstevec
40,as seen in many movies including Blade Runner,"If you are in to either science fiction or architecture, this is worth a stop. It is a working office building, but with incredible bones. The ceiling is made of glass, giving it a steampunk, part past, part future feel. If you are downtown, swing by. Head over to grand central market for lunch afterwards, or jump on the subway and dine at Phillipes or Yang Chow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifesaBeach006

40,Worth a look,"We went as part of a walking tour and its a lovely place to see. Amazing that it was saved from demolition. Well worth watching a movie like ""The Artist"" first to get a sense of the place first. There is not a whole lot to see other than the view on the image, but it is interesting to hear the story about it and get a sense of the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheMagicBus
50,A Window Into the Past,"The Bradbury Building is in the Historic Core of DTLA, and I loved stopping at it to take a look inside. It's right by the Grand Central Market, which I went to for lunch before deciding to take a look at the Bradbury Building, which I had heard about before because of its fame from appearing in many movies and TV shows. I love the juxtaposition of the unassuming exterior with the absolutely magnificent interior of the building. The iron staircases weaving their way up to the glass atrium at the top of it all is marvelous. You can just walk right in during the day and peer up at the beautiful levels of the building, so make a quick stop and take a peek! They also have tour guides that can give you detailed information on the building, although I just quickly stopped by for a look. Beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParkerGreen
50,Beauty and Film History,"Ok, it's been a few years. But the fact that I can still remember the impression that this building made on me 40+ years later should inspire you. The building must have been recently renovated or something, because there was an article in the LA Times. So I drove out from San Bernardino, 1-1/2 hours away. Pre Blade Runner, one of my favorite movies, it still knocked my socks off. And I still feel that awe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyep_12
40,A beautiful unique historic interior - essential if you love architecture,"This is a fantastic building, a unique Los Angeles classic. If you love architecture, it is definitely worth taking a peek inside. There isn't anything to really ""do"" in there, but it is in the heart of downtown near Central Market. Many folks know this interior from ""Blade Runner"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretaNova
50,Definitely worth a look,This is an amazing building and definitely worth a look if you can fit it in. The outside of the building does not give away the splendour of architecture that you will find inside.

40,Great experience for architecture and movie buffs alike,"The Bradbury was part of my self-designed architecture tour of LA. It was worth the trip downtown. The interior is beautiful as expected. Access is limited to the main floor and a couple of landings. It is tricky to photograph with bright light coming in from the central atrium and the tight public space, but you can still get good shots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W640UPkylew

40,Unique Building,If you're in the downtown and have the time - do walk inside the Bardbury Building to check out the unique architectural here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanadventure
40,So Blessed Cool is the Bradbury,"Thank goodness there are wonderful city tours and we ran into someone who told us about a free one! You can just tip at the end. Well worth it. It included the historic Bradbury building that has been in Bladerunner and many more movies and shows.The two-hour free walking tour of downtown LA, focused on L.A.'s history, architecture and public art. It did go just under two miles and took about two hours+, however, it did include many downtown landmarks such as Union Station, El Pueblo de Los Angeles, the Bradbury, Central Library and Pershing Square.Getting back to the Bradbury, it is an architectural landmark! Located at 304 South Broadway at West 3rd Street in downtown Los Angeles, California for those that want to skip the tours and get right to the building. You can google the location and find pay parking not too far away. I do suggest a garage due to heat and the area.Built in 1893, the building was commissioned by Los Angeles gold-mining millionaire Lewis L. Bradbury and constructed by draftsman George Wyman from the original design by Sumner Hunt (had to look that up, forgot a few of the details). The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977 and is the city's oldest landmarked building.A few cool details about the building; Wyman, self-educated architect, was earning $5 a week working for Hunt[ – at first refused the offer, but then supposedly he and his wife had a message from his dead brother Mark using a planchette board. The message was reported to be: ""Take the Bradbury Building--it will make you famous.""As mentioned before it has appeared in many movies and shows such as: Blade Runner, D.O.A., and I, The Jury, M, The White Cliffs of Dover, The Indestructible Man, Chinatown, The Cheap Detective, Avenging Angel Murphy's Law, Wolf, Disclosure, Lethal Weapon 4, Pay It Forward, (500) Days of Summer, and The Artist (and many made for TV movies, shows and music videos, as well).If that is not enough cool factor for you, both DC Comics and Marvel Comics – the latter of which has offices in the real Bradbury Building – have published comic book series based on characters that work in the historic landmark. AND the building serves as the headquarters for the Marvel Comics team The Order, and in the DC universe, the Human Target runs his private investigation agency from the building.So, go by yourself, with a tour group or grab your loved one but go, go, go and have yourself a gander at a historic-super-cool- wonder that cost three times too much to build but are you not glad they did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyK263
50,An architectural gem,"You've seen it in movies from the 1930s to Blade Runner. The brick work exterior hides an atrium surrounded by turn-of-the-20th century wrought ironwork edging the balconies and the original elevator cage. Walking in the first time, half a century ago, knocked me for a loop. Access to upper floors is limited now, but just standing on the ground floor under that magnificent skylight is worth it. And it has always been free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO
50,A masterpiece,You really need to see this place. Don't waste time looking at photos and trying to decide whether to go. Just visit it you really will definitely not be disappointed. I think the less you know before hand the better the experience will be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFromSM
50,Iconic Location,"You simply cannot visit Los Angeles without making a stop at the Bradbury Building. The internal architecture is beyond amazing. The wrought iron work and glass atrium are amazing. I would recommend setting up a guided tour however because outside of the tour you're not allow to cross over the threshold of the top of the first staircase. Even if you don't get a tour, it's worth a visit. If you're hungry take a walk across the street to the west and south about a block and treat yourself to a myriad of selections at the Los Angels Central Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyStompanado

50,Wonderful Surprise,"Some time ago I hosted friends from Wisconsin and was taking them around to ""tourist attractions"" in Los Angeles. One of my friends said she really wanted to visit the Bradbury Building. I, I'm embarrassed to say, had never heard of it. My friend informed me it appeared in ""Blade Runner"" and so when we were going down ""Angels' Flight"" we ask the operator and he told us it was very near, indeed it was right across the street from the Grand Central Market. And so we went and upon entering I was really gobsmacked. What a great building! It is true that you can only visit the first floor and up to the first landing, but what you see is by looking straight up is really an amazing sight. I really advise you to put it on your tourist agenda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bleeson8
40,Cool and easy,"A must see for Blade Runner fans. It's a neat lobby architecturally. They let you walk around the first and second floor of the atrium. A quick stop really, maybe 15-30 minutes.

40,Would Love to Tour the Whole Building,"Even if you just stop in for a couple minutes when walking by, you have to take in the beauty and vision that is the Bradbury building. Public access is limited to first floor and a certain point on staircase leading up to second floor. It's totally worth it. Great photo opportunities and it always makes you want to go home and watch Bladerunner. I do wish they offered tours of the building, it is something I would GLADLY pay to visit. (Any tips?) Even still, it is obviously a Los Angeles landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBarnhart

30,(500) Days of Being Shushed,"I took a train into DTLA with a friend and planned on stopping into the Bradbury Building having seen it in (500) Days of Summer. We came in on a Saturday and were surprised that we couldn't actually go up the stairs to look around. It's good for a picture, and the attendant there happily obliged us in taking a few shots of us with the background, but I had expected to be able to walk around more. There are businesses throughout, which is probably why they don't want throngs of tourists wandering around. I was a little bummed though that we couldn't see more of the interior.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLadyJess
50,Do Androids ....,You have seen the building in some great films. The interior is an architectural gem. A shame you can only see the inside from the first floor but still amazing for fans of Blade Runner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charleso3
50,Interesting Site!,"I first visited the Bradbury building years ago. It was something I have never seen before, especially because of the buildings history. It is still an operating building. Its always cool to see the old elevators. There's a lot of history here! Great stop during tour of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKiaBaby
50,A downtown Los Angeles MUST SEE!,"If you go to Los Angeles you definitely should stop by the Bradbury Building. Once you go inside you'll realize you've seen this building dozens of times in films, television and commercials. I had the good fortune to work there for several years and each and everyday I enjoyed the architecture and the ambiance. even if you only stop by for 5 or 10 minutes its worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mexic0maniac
50,This is where Ridley Scott filmed....,This building is so special and unusual in Los Angeles. The iron work inside is some thing to behold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Webisan
50,Even better than I remembered,"I visited this building as a teenager back in the 1970s, and it was always just one of those buildings I held in the back of my mind as someplace spectacular. I was overjoyed that it's been fixed up, but the beauty was kept. Take a few minutes, and wander into the lobby -- it's free, and worth the time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazytracy78
40,Parking for Bradbury Building/Downtown walking tour.,"This public parking structure is located on the very same block as the Bradbury building, however, on the opposite side of the block. It is is a large, multi story public parking structure. Look for the ""public parking signs"". I occasionally visit the area for business and prefer this parking structure over most other private lots, which charge more and are generally not covered. You can enter from South Broadway, W 4th street or South Spring St. The address for one of the businesses on the first floor is 333 S Spring St, Los Angeles, CA , so you can plug that into your GPS. As of today, 7/20/16, parking costs $12. This is very reasonable for downtown. Make sure you take your parking ticket with you. You will pay at the automated machine ON THE FIRST FLOOR by the elevator. it accepts credit card (no AMEX) and cash. The parking is covered (good for summer weather) and seems reasonably safe. You can probably start your down town walking tour here. You are right across the street from Central Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isra-Caltraveler
50,A must see - for LA history and movie fans!,"A million words have been written about Los Angeles' famous Bradbury Building. Of course, ever since the early 1980’s, you can’t go to the Bradbury Building without reciting Blatty’s final speech to Deckard, before he dies: “I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears...in...rain. Time to die.”Yes, that climatic rooftop chase scene ending in the rain with that bittersweet moment of death was supposed to be filmed on the top of the Bradbury Building, though mostly that was a recreation studio set-piece, but with backdrop’s filmed at the real location, as well as some second unit chase shots… but that doesn’t matter, we all find ourselves reliving that iconic moment in cinema history when we go there.Of course the interior is seen in many sequences of the film, since it is the set for the character J. F. Sebastian's apartment, which gives us both the introduction of his character, those of his robot-dwarf creations, and of course the introduction of Daryl Hannah’s haunting “Pris”.Of course it was used numerous times before and after that in movies and TV shows, most notably I the original film noir classic D.O.A., Marlowe (there’s still an office with one of those “clouded” front door windows with “Phillip Marlowe: Detective” written on it), Chinatown, Murphy’s Law, The Cheap Detective, Lethal Weapon, and the quite unusual early Hollywood “Silent Film” and recent Academy Award winner, “The Artist”. On TV you’ve seen it again and again, including the classic original Outer Limits, Quantum Leap, Mission: Impossible and the 1930’s themed detective series “City of Angels”.It is known by locals as the “Geoid of LA”, since the building looks like every other early 19th Century building on Downtown Broadway Blvd on the outside, but when you walk in, it takes your breath away. It is like nothing else you’ve seen, though architects will try to pin it down as Renaissance Romanesque Revival. No, really it’s like nothing else. Build in 1893 by a mining millionaire named Bradbury, it is instantly recognizable by the skylights (used so amazingly in “Blade Runner”), the New Orleans style wrought-iron railings, the almost total use of polished rare woods, and its centerpiece: the birdcage elevator.Like so much wondrous adventures in Downtown Los Angeles, (which, if you visit LA is a total must, actually much more exciting and awe-inspiring than Disneyland and Universal Studios, and Hollywood Blvd!), you find yourself suddenly transported to another time and place.It is still very much used today. In fact, a lot of drama takes place in this building, since it is the headquarters for the Los Angeles Police Department’s Internal Affairs Division… where, as you’ve seen in hundreds of TV shows and movies, those much “mis-trusted” officers question their fellow officers for abuses under the “color of law”. But this isn’t CSI. This is the real thing, and you can find men and women, on both sides of these “judgements” coming and going, or sitting with stern faces at a newly installed Subway on the first floor.Because of this, and some other sensitive offices, the top floors are off-limits, but tourists are very much welcome, and are even met by a “guide”, who will let you look around, take photos, and ride that famous elevator.Best of all, is that surrounding the building are dozens and dozens of amazing other downtown LA attactions. The two closest that I truly recommend is across the street at the massive Central Market (again, some of the best chases and shoot-outs are done there), which also houses, not only great fresh produce, and trinkets to bring home, but some of the best food stalls of all kinds of ethic cultures. And now, what with the new popularity of Downtown LA with business and artists alike, some of the top restaurants are bringing in “outlet” and “popup” food stalls to this cavernous wonderland. Again, you will feel like you are in a different time and place. And of course just a few blocks away: “Angles Flight”… the shortest official railroad in the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heywoodf307
40,Move History,We came across this place as we wandered out of the downtown market. It is very fun to see a building that you recognize in so many movies like 100 Days of Summer and Blade Runner. It is a quick stop and harkens back to another era. It is great that it has been kept in such good shape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_otter_1111

40,NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THIS BUILDING,"In the midst of LA Downtown behind a rather unassuming exterior is The Bradbury. History and architecture buffs will find their efforts to find this place worth the effort. The number of movies productions that have used this interior must be innumerable. In the surrounding few square blocks you will also find old, closed movie theaters from the past that still show art deco exteriors on the facades and on the sidewalks. NOTE: As with most older downtown areas, this location is best visited in the daytime hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDave

A place you must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sychan987
40,Good for a short visit,"The scene of many hollywood films, the Bradbury building in Downtown LA is now an office complex. Visitors can walk around the ground floor and take pictures. That's it.

50,Great on a tour of downtown,"Two years ago my dad, brother, and myself took an impromptu self guided tour of downtown L.A. and we literally stumbled on this building. Thankfully it was open on a Sunday, most of downtown is pretty empty on the weekends which made this building even more special at first.What you see is what you get mostly, it's beautiful, it has been in several movies, but you can't go beyond the first level. It's roped off and therewas a security guard present to remind you not to even think about it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajserrano1452
30,Interesting Building but Limited Access,"We were a bit disappointed when we entered the Bradbury Building compared the great pictures we saw here on Trip Advisor. Only the small Lobby area and the small first floor landing are available for public access. It's free to enter the building and the inside of the building is truly phenomenal though with its architectural details . I would recommend visiting this place as a brief stop on a combined tour of the area. We drove more than one hour to see the building and expected it to be more satisfying, Across the street is Grand Central Market and it's a nice place to check out the open market-style food stores for coffee, breakfast, produce, and all kinds of international foods. Parking is easy and right around the corner if you arrive early..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandC0218
40,A must for Blade Runner or sci-fi fans,"On our visit to downtown LA to check out the sights, I dragged my family with me to go check out the Bradbury Building. Nondescript on the outside, it is the inside of this Art Deco masterpiece I wanted to see, it’s gold-and-black wrought-iron railings arrayed around a central courtyard open to the huge skylight which dominated to the roof of the building.It was in this gorgeous interior that Harrison Ford’d Deckard battled Rutger Hauer’s Roy Batty in Blade Runner, and for which the building is now famous. We needed only 15 minutes inside to take pictures and climb the stairs to the two landings you are allowed to get to, and my movie-geek was satisfied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan

30,Rude security guard,"We went here on the last day of your visit. Took forever to find parking. When we finally got here at 6:00, a security guard came around the corner and told us they were closed and chased us out. I asked is we could take a couple of pictures (literally would have taken us 5 minutes) he said no. Kinda sucks, my daughter loves architecture from that era and will be going to school for architecture. Not sure when we will have the opportunity to be in California again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108kerik
40,Stairway to LA's Past,"Truth be told I was not even aware of (or interested in) this significant historical landmark in DTLA until an out-of-town visitor incentivized my own discovery. We drove to downtown on a Sunday so finding parking was not too bad. This building is right across Broadway from the Grand Central Market near the corner of 3rd and Broadway. That means there is an abundance of eating choices close by. In addition, El Pollo Loco (Mexican) and Carl's Jr. Burger are located on 3rd, and a Subway is practically next door to suit your taste and budget. This famous architectural masterpiece with an amazing interior is open free to the public. You have limited access once inside; you can go up the stairs to the 2nd level to admire and aim your iPhone cameras at the beautiful interior from various angles. The background story of the building is posted on a lamp pole right outside. Parking can cost from $6 and up at Joe’s Auto Park nearby or street meter parking (9am -3pm) on weekdays if you are lucky -bring credit card or lots of quarters. The best way to see this photo op (short 1/2 hour tops visit) is to make it part of a walking tour of the gentrified DTLA during day time that includes other restored historic points of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LnS2004
20,"Unique building, but weren't impressed with the information presented to us","The outside of this building looks completely normal, only once you go to the inside you realized the beauty of it.

50,Amazing architecture in DTLA,This is SUCH a cool building. The architecture inside is incredibly ornate and truly breathtaking. The iron work is stunning on the railings and the elevator. The staircases are perfectly aligned and really just so pleasing to the eye. It costs nothing to go here and you can only go to the first floor and up the first staircase. The rest of the buildings are used for offices. I would recommend coming in the afternoon so the sun doesn't white out your pictures. Such a cool building. You can see why movies and TV shows shoot here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
40,Worth a visit if in the area.,"This interesting building is across the road from the Central Market, so amble across and have a look around.

40,For History buffs and Antedelivians who remember Blade Runner,"This is one of the iconic structures in downtown, it's 1893 is considered one of the finest architectural masterpieces in Southern California. Incredible cast iron railings, elevators and enough insanely expensive marble to make it worth seeing if for nothing more.For you movie fans, this is where they shot the tenement scene in Blade Runner. Your remember the rundown, dirty, wet, refuse strewn scene where Harrison Ford is tracking the replicant? This is where it was filmed. Visiting a way to really appreciate the ability of Hollywood to create a make believe world out of anything. It's hard to imagine doing but they pulled it off in a building the average person could never envision as a dingy tenement.Across from the Grand Central Market, walk over, it's worth it.

40,Bradbury Building,"This building has been in several movies and TV shows. It is beautiful inside. The only disappointment was that you can only go up the stairs to the first landing. It was fun to take pictures and walk around the bottom floor. It is probably a good idea to park as close to the building as possible. We parked a couple streets away and decided to walk. It was a very interesting experience that I would not want to do experience again. Seeing the building was great and there is a neat theater across the street, but the surrounding neighborhood is not the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jewels797

50,Sci-fi in real life - fantastic!,"I first saw the Bradbury Building in an episode of the Outer Limits, called Demon with a Glass Hand (1964), by Harlan Ellison, and it made a huge impression on me. Many years later, it made an even bigger impression in Blade Runner, as the building where J.F. Sebastian lived, and where the climax takes place.So I had pretty high expectations when I finally got to see it in real life - and was not at all disappointed. It is a beautiful building, with the enormous light-filled atrium, wrought iron railings and cage lifts. True, I love the way it looked at night in Blade Runner, but it is breath-taking in daylight. Visitors can walk in and only up to the first floor, but that is plenty to allow you to experience this architectural gem. Many other architectural gems from early 20th century are within walking distance; the whole area is highly recommended for an afternoon's walking tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M_Carter333
50,What an interesting building,"I took my 16 year old son inside the Bradbury Building after eating at Grand Central market.

50,You've Seen This Building Before,"The Bradbury has been an actor in many movies. You have seen the distinctive atrium, elevators and offices My favorite film with the Bradbury is ""Blade Runner"". The interior sets the stage for the final scenes. While this movie uses rain, darkness, and decrepitude to set the stage, the space is actually light filled, and plays up the wonderful iron work against the brick walls. The elevators are open caged and framed in iron. If you are a lover of beautiful spaces, this one is worth spending time inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias

We were surprised and delighted at how well-preserved and beautiful the building is. It is currently in use as an office building (among the tenants are a private investigation firm and the LAPD Internal Affairs Division), but the public is allowed to visit and photograph the iconic lobby and first mezzanine. We went on a weekend, so although the offices were presumably closed, the lobby doors were open. I felt we were less disruptive to the tenants that way.

As a huge fan of Blade Runner I couldn't visit the city and not visit this iconic location. I wasn't disappointed.Less imposing from the outside, it isn't until you step into the atrium that the full, stunning architecture hits you. It's all there, the tiled walls, the staircases, the mechanical lift and the glass roof. As it's still a residential building you can't go about the first floor staircase (or use the lift), but there is still plenty to see from here. And it's free to walk in and look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msg1969

Although nothing special from the outside, the moment you enter you are in for a treat in this building. The detailing on the stairways surrounding the central sky lighted atrium are like eye candy. Access is limited to the ground level only so as not to disturb tenants. It's worth a drive or metro ride to downtown if only to see this, but when you are done enjoying this lovely interior, which has a kind of cult like fan base of the film ""Bladerunner"" as part of the film was shot there; take a stroll across the street to the Central Market for lunch.

There is a sort of guard on the main floor to keep all of us regular people out of the metal cage type elevator we have seen in the movies. You can't go upstairs unless you have an appointment with someone in the building.

I have visited the Bradbury Building probably 100 times or more; I simply love walking in, taking a quick look, loving what I see and leave. I visit it as much as I can and I have for 60 years.While looking simply like an ""old building"" across from Grand Central Market (newly up-dated and a current ""must do"" on its own) the Bradbury Building is the scene for many a movie and will be recognized immediately. It is a delight to behold and one can spend hours or minutes and still appreciate what you see. This building is a part of downtown that is worth a special trip. The great food shops at Grand Central across the street (an an amazing gigantic knife store next to it) are simply a bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918

50,Wonderful,"We visited this building as part of an LA Architectural tour. The exterior of the building is fairly plain although there is some interesting brick work. The interior was the gem. Unfortunately as this building is occupied by LAPD much of it is out of bounds but that does not detract from what can be seen, an amazing internal void lit by highlight windows. The mix of Art Deco and modernist features makes this space very pleasing to the eye. The metalwork echoed from the Victorian period. Not bad for a building designed by a draftsman ( that was the information we were given).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outandabout1208

You can take pictures as long as you don't bring out a bunch of equipment and make a scene. Truly a throwback to craftsmanship of times long gone. A lot smaller than what you image it to be. While I was there a small school tour came by. Guards are friendly but watchful that your not taking pictures for commercial use or without permission. Don't plan on spending more than a few minutes or the guards start asking question and get impatient and ask what you business there is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mh974

50,An Iconic Los Angeles Building,"I worked in the Bradbury Building for 3 years and never really looked around nor appreciated the beautiful architecture of this building. Security guards are stationed in the lobby and only tenants are allowed to ride the original wrought iron manually-operated elevators or proceed beyond the ground floor, but tourists can still see enough of this amazing building to appreciate the intricate wrought iron, wood and brickwork. Highly recommended if you are in downtown Los Angeles (3rd Street and Broadway).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SgtBuffy
30,"Architecture and Film Buffs, Enjoy","Worth a quick stop if you're in the area. Tourists are only allowed on the ground floor and up to the first landing of the staircase. That's enough, though, to admire the pretty ironwork and the glass ceiling, and marvel at the vintage elevators which still require human operators. The Bradbury Building has featured in a number of Hollywood productions, most notably 1982's ""Blade Runner"" (the interior was smaller than it looked in the movie).

It is in kind of a rundown area and does not appear like much on the outside but the inside is spectacular. It looks old, cool and modern at the same time. It is hard to believe it was built over over a 120 years ago (it opened in 1893!). Parts of the film Blade Runner where filmed here. You can walk in during the day and check it all out very quickly.

50,Great architecture,"When you see the facade of the Bradbury building you would probably be underwhelmed to walk inside. However, once you walk in, you will be awed by all the details that are going on. The cast-iron work for the staircases and elevator is so elaborate and the natural light that comes through the glass ceiling casts beautiful linear shadows all throughout the building. This place is definitely worth visiting, even if you're not into architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizyk

Built in 1893, it has been restored and maintained in perfect condition. It's interior is very 'film noir"" and has been used in countless movies and TV shows. In one of my favorite movies BLADE RUNNER, the final scene was shot in this building. Also the movie CHINATOWN had many scenes filmed here. Be sure to check out the elevators and stair cases-they are classic.After seeing building go across street to Grand Central Market for a very different experience.It is totally LA and reflects the large Hispanic population and their food preferences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmahler
50,Great if you're a history or architecture buff,"I personally love both history and architecture, so I gave the Bradbury Building a 5 star rating. But most people, especially Millennials, would probably rate it a 3 or 4 instead. The attraction is the architecture and metal work in a ""cutting edge"" building for its time. Most tourists walk right past it without even knowing its significance. Like many of the old movie palaces on Broadway, the Bradbury is an LA landmark. Beware of the pick pockets on the street and in the area of old downtown Los Angeles. LA's Broadway is not nearly as safe as Manhattan's Broadway!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford

50,If you LOVE architecture and history a MUST SEE In LA,"I LOVE this building. I was lucky enough to have an office here in the early 90's right after the building was restored and during the time that Jack Nicholson made the movie ""Wolf"" or ""Wolfman"" something like that. I remember them filming there and those of us that worked there were very protective over the way the building was being treated. It has gorgeous marble floors and wood details on the stairs, the elevator is one of the most unique in the world. The bathrooms are gorgeous (yes the bathrooms at least they were back then) and the offices were amazing. I NEVER wanted to leave work. The ceiling of this building makes you feel like you are outside. (The offices are not like that at least my office had a regular ceiling) but from the courtyard and stairs it's definitely something to see in person! They used to give tours and I recently saw a friend of mine post a picture of himself in the building so I'm guessing they still are. If you can get in to see this and you like history and interesting buildings this is a REAL GEM. it's at Broadway and 3rd in Downtown LA. PS- this area is getting better but it's still not super safe. I don't recommend going after dark or alone and if you do go and want to walk around the area - keep it low key. Don't go flashing jewelry, purses, etc..There are parking lots with attendants and i highly recommend paying the money for that. The Central Market is across the street and great for food and an experience! Just keep the above safety advice in mind there as well. Be aware, be safe but have fun!! Bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliK222
50,Beyond gorgeous and historical,"Just to walk into the building is beautiful. If in the area, walk in just to see the majesty of the atrium with amazing ironwork and glass.

Either way, a must-see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
50,"Architectural Wonder in Wrought Iron, Marble, Glass & Wood!","What a find! One must tread carefully and quietly, as folks live and work here, but the lobby is a must-see in downtown Los Angeles. Restored in the 1990s, I believe, it is a marvel in its use of fine materials to create beautiful, functional forms. The open, wrought-iron elevator is a classic, used in Blade Runner and other films. It's the ceiling that is the real scene-stealer, though, with glass-block panels that reveal changing sky colors overhead. Altogether a great ... and free ... experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality

40,If your in the area it's worth a visit!,The Bradbury building is a cool building! The outside is nice but the inside is beautiful!!! We where super impressed! We didn't tour the upper levels we only did the lobby and first stair landing. Took some cool photos :) we didn't do anything else in the downtown area so it was a little less exciting for us but if you are planning to be in the area it's well worth it :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898juliam
50,A must-see L.A. gem,"This fascinating architectural milestone is one of many gems in downtown LA. Free access to the interior ground floor where you get a fine view of the iron work on upper floors, which can only be visited by prior arrangement. A must-see stop, even for a quick eyeful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arrow101
40,Downtown L.A. sites,"Beautiful interior, I stop by every time I am in the neighborhood! While there, check out a larger-then-life (70ft) Anthony Quinn ""Zorba"" mural across the 3rd Street Bradbury' entrance, and the Million Dollar Theater across the Broadway entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanZ874
20,Following the film,"I like: building outside + inside captivating.I did not like: building tour is free, you can tour the ground floor only.To rise to the upper floors, preferably coordinate and determine in advance with the building management. May be a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meiravl_13
40,Beautiful,"I missed doing a walking tour and only got 5 minutes to check out the Bradbury Building. It was on my list of things to see in Downtown Los Angeles but also as I love Bladerunner! As like others have said, beautiful iron work and historic building with alot of light as well. I only took photos and admired the architecture and design. Work a look if you are in downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilby2009
30,"A fun place to see, but not much to it","The Bradbury building is famous as a movie landmark (seen in The Artist and Blade Runner). The outside it is a normal building, but the inside is amazingly beautiful. It has filigree ironwork on all of the exposed interior floors, and light pours into the space from a large skylight. A fun visit, but since it's a working office building, nothing much to do but take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenturtle2
40,A dream of a building,"Downtown LA, like most of the city, is a bit of a dump, but there are a few gems in amongst all the tat and flashy mirror glass. The Bradbury Building is certainly worth a detour and you simply must go inside. On the Saturday we visited, the sun was coming through the skylights and making the amber-coloured tiles in the lobby positively glow - no wonder it's a film-maker's and photographer's dream! The Conservancy people have done a grand job and this is a spectacular composition of late Victorian wrought iron, ceramic tile and wood. We would do the Conservancy tour next time, as this was just a drop-by visit. Beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DieselB
50,Spectacular!,"If you are a fan of light, and ironwork that suggests a sophisticated steampunk vibe, this is for you. Just walk in and look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CleareyeHollywood
50,You Have to Walk Inside,"I took a conservancy tour and learned a lot more about the Bradbury Building and lots of other downtown buildings. The ornate iron staircase in the Bradbury was recently scene in the movie ""The Artist"". Have you picture taken with Charlie Chaplain downstairs. Such a beautiful building!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyLipstick
50,What a Treasure,"WOW. Must see even free. Paid extra to see a show-only a few dollars. Did not think the show was special, BUT the narrative was unbelievable. It was a cloudy day. Sunset was gorgeous. Interesting birds behavior just before sunset. Would have a commanding view with clear weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mel1150
50,Truly enjoyed hearing the history,"I had heard of the Bradbury Building for many, many years so I was VERY happy to finally visit it. The docent was very knowledgeable! Sometimes you have a docent that can't ""fill in the cracks"" but ours was excellent. Will recommend this to my friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdrnek22
50,A wonderful piece of old LA,The ornate design of the interior of this building is magnificent. It is like nothing else I have visited in all the cities I have been too. Truly worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596EdwardS

40,Worth a quick visit,Near Pershing Square metro stop. Won't take long to visit. You can only enter from the ground floor and go one floor above.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manchester_UKSteve
40,Architectural icon,"Once inside you will likely recognise this building as a location used in movies. The steel, glass and ironwork are amazing and it is well worth a look.

50,Very Cool Place to Visit,"Awesome architecture. If you are looking for interesting things in unassuming packages, and the scene of many movies, pay a visit to the Bradbury Bldg. Go inside the front door (next door to the Subway). There is a security guard, and you won't be able to go upstairs or places other than the lobby, but what you can see is beautiful and worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SledMan
40,A nice short photo op,"This is just a short 10-minute stop to absorb a bit of culture during a visit to LA. Well worth it to get some snaps to keep for memories. You are only able to go up only to the first platform landing (as the upper levels are for tenants / offices, to respect their privacy). Though, it would have been awesome if we were allowed to take the elevators and walk up to the higher floors! So long as you announced yourself to the security guard sitting there, you are free to roam the area as you choose.The building was easy to reach. If you know where the bottom of Angel's Flight Railway is, all you have to do is cross the street and walk through the Grand Central Market to the opposite end, which will bring you to the other side of the block (which would be Broadway). Once you exit Grand Central Market, the Bradbury is just across the street, on your left, next to the Sprint store. The market ended up being a nice before / after stop to get a drink or bite, making the trip out to visit the Bradbury a bit more worth it, in that sense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RotatingGlobe
50,HISTORY BUFFS' DELIGHT,"Check out this piece of Los Angeles ' history. Downtown, near the Olvera Street experience, the Third Street tram vertical railway, and Japanese-America Museum area. It is a tad difficult to find, but in the heart of ""old"" Los Angeles. The architectural trimmings and details are wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillT360
50,Blade Runner ..,That's right ..if you saw Blade Runner in the 80's this is the building they used in the movie ..but even better to see it in person ..the film is infact credited with saving the building ..sppend as long as you want and make sure you take lots of photos ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhgoodwin

50,Architectural gem,The Bradbury Building is an architectural gem. You have to go in the door and kindly ask permission to enter. Once inside one feels what a time traveler would experience. The elevators are a delight and if permitted walk up the staircase and view the building from every possible view.The Grand. Central Market is across the street and Angels Flight is on the other side of the market.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Working Office building,An amazing piece of architecture. Unfortunately you can't get past the first feet of the lobby unless you have real business in one of the offices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliceT800
40,Peek only...couldn't go in.,"Was trying to hit all the top downtown sites. Went to the door to go in. There was a sign on the door ""No tourists today"". An official came to open the door for someone who had business there. When I asked why tourists weren't allowed in, he explained LAPD Internal Affairs is located there. During the time we visited, the city was on heightened alert due to a threat against the LAPD. I was able to see a peek inside but it made it more interesting when it wasn't just an interesting building but was actually involved with an incident that was constantly on the news while we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/labonvoyer
40,"A beautiful, iconic building","It should be part of a visit to the downtown area. It is the building depicted in the Harrison Ford movie ""Blade Runner.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccg20
50,Incredible experience,"We walked along way to get into this building. Wow, it was worth it. Great architecture, well maintained and fantastic details. Shame that you only can go up beyond the first floor landing. Even so it was worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Villa57
40,Part of a walking tour.,This was where. Walking tour through downtown LA ended. Cool end to tour with lots of history! Standing in the lobby really triggered a lot of movie memories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jjeennifer
50,An Architectural Wonder,"This classic building has been featured in many famous films over the years, including Blade Runner, Wolf and Chinatown. And no wonder - the distinctive lines of this 1893 building's interior courtyard are lovely. A must see when you are in downtown Los Angeles. A working office building, wander in for free and prepare to be inspired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichellePage
50,Iconic,If you're a film fan or just a fan of architecture then this place is well worth a stop even though it is slightly off the beaten tourist track. I went as a film fan but was knocked over by the splendour of the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scfc66
50,Iconic,"If you're visiting L.A. PLEASE put this down on your ""to do"" list. The Bradbury building is exceptional, rare and quite beautiful. Located at the top of Broadway it is a glimpse back in time to the Los Angeles of Philip Marlow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanleypsmith
30,beautiful building,"its worth the visit, just traffic and parking is a problem, but the building is really cool, is has been restored and is well maintain. It's definitely a landmark to be visited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famfavtravels
40,A must for Blade Runner fans,"The inside of this office block has to be seen to be believed. It is so unusual and so beautiful it is hard to believe it was transferred into the grotty damp place in Blade Runner. It was also recently featured in The Artist. Great for photos, and come out of the side entrance to get a great shot of some street art that takes up the whole side of a building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moogharrison
50,Iron-wrought work of art to admire regardless if you're a Blade Runner fan or not,"Bradbury building is a work of art, though perhaps not as much on the outside as on the inside. It's an important landmark in Los Angeles and it's worth stopping by if you have the chance. The interior design is amazing with the iron-wrought decorations and, most of all, the two elevators. There's a bit of information available inside on the building and on some of the movies that have been shot there, perhaps most notably Blade Runner. Moreover, it's free, however visitors may only access the ground floor and the first floor. There were no tours available on site when we were there, but there was an info sign mentioning that one or several companies doing LA tours include the Bradbury building on their tours. (Don't know though if doing a tour will grant you access beyond the first floor of the building, but I doubt that.) Whether you're a fan of Blade Runner or not, stop by and admire this beautiful building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496timd

50,A walk through history,"This is a quick ten or twenty minute walk through an iconic piece of downtown Los - Angeles architecture that was featured in the movie ""The Artist"" . Visitors are only able to explore the lobby area, but it is well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragonhart
50,Must See,"Entering the building makes one feel Jack Nicholson's presence. Hollywood is written all over the place, but more than the exciting experience is its great architecture.The facade of the building is very unassuming but as you enter the lobby you can immediately feel the nostalgia and history of this place. The heavy use of wrought iron accentuates the intricacies of its delicate designs while maintaining the warmth of the entire building. the atmosphere is quiet and not crowded with tourist, and I can only surmise that the Bradbury Building was built to be appreciated by people with discriminating taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penoytraveller
50,Blade runner,I have been to LA numerous times but never knew about this building. Great attraction off the beaten path meaning not a studio tour. Worth a look. It's a working building with offices Still the public is allowed to come in and go up to the gate by the second floor. Of course the claim to fame is the parts of blade runner was filmed here. Not a fan of the area but a terminal market across the street and many lots to park in. We hit there after my annual visit to the philipees. Spelled that wrong. But the home of the original French dip is not far if you have a car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simey23
50,A step back in time,"The Bradbury building is a historical gem that should be added to any tour of downtown LA. Although you can only view the atrium and the first floor it is well worth a visit. The iron and wood atrium has been well maintained and it’s like stepping back in time. The building doesn’t look like much from the outside so you may be inclined to walk past it, but don’t!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danville

40,Even better than my last visit,"I had been to Bradbury Building years ago when I first worked in downtown Los Angeles. No one makes a structure as beautiful as this one is any more. The cost of the iron work and plaster work alone would be highly prohibitive. When i first visited, it did not have the cachet that the address has now with so many upscale businesses and offices there. It has been the location of many film shoots in its 110 year history. This is what money from ""The Gilded Age"" bought for a working environment. If Angels' Flight is high on the list of ""must -see attractions"" in downtwon LA, then this one has to be on that list also. worth an hour or moare of anyone's time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonaOrangeCountyCA

50,Stunning historic building... A must see for any fan of Blade Runner,"On our recent trip to downtown LA, my wife and I HAD to drop by and visit the Bradbury Building which was the filming location for the movie Blade Runner. The building itself is occupied with businesses, so visitors can only see the ground floor. But the minute you step in, it's like you're in the movie! The building is located in a rather rundown part of town, but the interior is magnificent and you will recognize the details (railings, stairwells, skylight, elevator) from the movie. Well worth a trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PsyT

Or better still, leave the car at home and walk up and down Broadway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Regi184
50,Old Style Craftsmanship,"The Bradbury Building dates to earlier times when building ornamentation was more important than today. Wrought iron decoration fills the building, including the light filled courtyard. The building is on Broadway with a parking structure behind it. Other landmarks, such as the Biddy Mason Park and Wall, are within a few steps. The building is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

50,"Quick stop, but worth it","This building is definitely worth a quick stop for photos. Used in the movie ""Blade Runner"" among others, the lobby and first stairwell landing are available to visitors. However, as a working office building, there are no tours nor can visitors roam aimlessly throughout the building. Once inside, even the average photo bug is going to go snap happy. Fifteen or twenty minutes is all you will need. And don't forget to look for the Anthony Quinn mural just outside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,Amazing building that that will wow you,"As other reviewers have indicated, the Bradbury Building has been featured in a number of movies. The movie ""Bladerunner"" showed it in its pre-restoration days. Post-restoration, it has been featured in a number of movies and TV shows. Expect to be wowed by the architecture...and that fact that (unlike most architecture treasures in LA) it is still around for the next generation to enjoy.

40,Famous historic building,"If you're into historic buildings, especially those in films, then Bradbury Building is a must visit.Inside, it is just as beautiful as it looks from movies and photos.

50,A L.A. must,One of L.A.s treasures - a must to see -- and if you are here visit also Central Market across the street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViennaAustria
50,Worth the Detour!,Make the Bradbury Building a destination for any tour of LA. You need to find a place to park and then walk through either of the doors into a lobby of splendour and magic. Of course it looks familiar because it is used as a location for many films (Blade Runner included). But nothing lives up to the quiet mystery of the actual space. The history of the designer builder is a mystery...and you'll want to read the utopian treatise that they say is what inspired the whole concept. Particularly ironic (I think) is that the offices of LAPD's Internal Affairs Division are currently located here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anadamansea
50,An almost hidden downtown L.A. Gem,"this architectural gem fom days gone by (1893) has many stories: that of an unlnown young architect who never designed another building, to tales of haunted figures wandering after hours in the muted glow of alabaster sconces, to views of the faded, now restored glory of the Million Dollar Theatre across the street , and Grand Central market, of a downtown Broadway St where families used to go in their Sunday best to lunch and carch a movie. This multi story atrium topped brick , marble and wrought iron building is open to the public on the ground level, up to the first level landing only, but if you look very , very sad, an LAPD employee ( LAPD, along with state offices and architectural firms rent multi offices on multi floors) would take pity on you and take you to seeWhat is on the upper floors... Or go to laconservancy.org to see what is offered on downtown tours. various now modified offices sport tile fireplaces, and the firehoses on wooden spools, tho now not operable make you want to check out the nearby fire escapes to imagine scampering down. The high point of the building are the still operating , open cage twin elevators, complete with operators/ security guards who confirm that younhave modern day business there...again, practice your sad face for LAPD, in hopes of getting a ride. then glance down from the upper floor for a beautiful, symmetrical view of the patterns of architecture below. theBradbury is 1893 in the outer floors..no air conditioning, and the sun can beat down through the glass ceiling on a sweltering LA summer day...only after entering inner offices are you greeted withh cool air and dropped ceilings. corner offices still retain oversized windows and all original mouldings. No sound proofing from the city streets let you hear A 20th centtury cacophony of busses, Spanish language street hawkers and shops, the occasional fight, and traffic from your 19th century vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013

30,Bradbury Building,A very interesting building. I remembered it from Blade Runner and looked forward to seeing it but was disappointed that you could only go to the first floor .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillkelly777
30,As seen on TV and Movies,"How many times do you walk into a building and it takes your breath away? Well be prepared to get that feeling here. Built in 1893 by Lewis Bradbury, this building has more charm than you'll ever find in any shopping mall! This building is dripping with architechtual detail that will keep you with bated breath. This historical venure can been the backdrop for many famous movies. Pack a lunch and share the bench with a wonderful sculture of Charlie Chaplin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockiM
40,Step into another era... Welcome to the Bradbury!,"Visiting this building was like walking into a Hollywood movie scene. The building is beautiful inside! It almost feels like you stepped back in time an era or two. The marble staircases, wrought iron caged elevators, brick walls, and see through ceiling all add a unique atmosphere to this place. Oh and be ready to greet Charlie Chaplin on your way in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Oh... this is that building from Blade Runner,"Make sure you visit this on a historic walking tour! (Blade Runner, 100 days of Summer)And watch out for Replicans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacannes
50,The interior will blow you away,"Inspired by Edward Bellamy's ""Looking Backward,"" this building defies the stereotype of L.A. architecture as being dull. The skylight, coupled with the inward facing offices makes for a unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithdude
50,Great architecture,"Title says it all a great building, great architecture a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wololf
40,Bradbury Building,"It is the famous historic landmark in Los Angeles, it is free to access and anyone visit and take photos as they like! Great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayHongKong
40,stunningly beautiful,"Go inside to see a stunningly beautiful building. Rivals the best buildings in Chicago. Gorgeous wrought iron railings throughout, and old-fashioned elevators (the kind that must be manually operated). Unfortunately you can only go in the lobby (the upper floors are private, tenanted space). Still worth it just for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipper314
40,This feels familar!,I have not taken the tours but have been going to the Bradbury for years and it is a byegone part of LA. You will be standing there looking up and you will feel like you been there before. Besides the Bladerunner scene which is dramatically portrayed it is the more mundane office fronts and walks down the balconies that give pause. You feel like your in countless film noir and TV moments. Though not open to the public the Halloween parties there were epic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freeheelin13
50,Best as part of a downtown walking tour - stunning interior,"The Bradbury Building is a beautiful & unique building, but since it is hard to find & get to, is probably best done as part of a downtown LA walking tour.We took the Historic Core walking tour from the Los Angeles Conservancy, where it is the last building on a roughly 2 hour tour. Tours leave every Saturday at 10am in Pershing Square, across from the Biltmore Hotel, and cost $10 per person. The Bradbury has an interesting past that includes a seance & a mystery as to who actually designed it, according to the guide.Be sure to go up the stairs to the 1st floor of the Bradbury, which is as far up as they allow you to go. The light filled interior from the rooftop skylight, the flourishing ironwork stairs, the bright red & cream marble and Mexican tile look most impressive from above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queen1000
50,Don't miss the Bradbury Building if you're downtown,"We took the Metro Red Line to Pershing Square (4th St exit) and walked the two blocks to see the Bradbury Building. It's not particularly striking on the outside but we were shocked how amazing it was inside. The top 4 of 5 floors are used by law firms and government agencies but they let you go up to the first floor to get a view. The entire inside is marble, wood panel, wrought iron with daylight coming in the large atrium roof.It's free to see and take photos but it won't fill a lot of time so plan something addition to do downtown; don't come downtown just to see it on its own. (Search flickr for Bradbury Building pics to get an idea how cool it is.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purejadekid
20,You'd have to really want to see it...,"The Bradbury building was an interesting stop but I didn't enjoy getting there; traffic is a little crazy downtown and parking is really expensive ($2 per 15 minutes). If you are planning to go, I'd advise taking public transport if possible. The building itself is beautifully restored with glowing woods, gleaming ironwork and instantly recognisable from both Blade Runner and The Outer Limits. You can't go far into the building (obviously) so you'd really have to want to see it to come all the way downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flos
50,Fantastic for architecture & film fans,"Wonderful building, even though you can only see the inside from the ground floor lobby (where the dowtown office of Red Line Tours is located - their Inside Historic Downtown LA Tour starts with the Bradbury, and is an excellent tour).Great to see the Blade Runner location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreweF7165IG
