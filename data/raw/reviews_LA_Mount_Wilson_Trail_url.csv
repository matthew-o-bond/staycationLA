50,JUST FYI,"Several of the photos posted supposedly from Mt Wilson seem to actually be of places in Arizona or Utah. Not Mt. Wilson. That being said, it is scenic.",missecho
50,good stuff XD,"Mt. Wilson trail is sooooooooooooper pretty. (pro tip: use the word soooooooooooooper-it grabs the attention and is a mix between so and super) There are a lot of pretty waterfalls and pools tucked away that you can stop at and there are gorgeous views of the city. It is also really close to Sierra Madre, so you can get a spot of lunch if you are hungry afterward. I would highly recommend bringing snacks on the hike with you, it is high altitude and there are a few uphills. A good snack is a pita pocket sandwich- I myself made the mistake of not bringing one, but some people we walked past did and I could not stop thinking about eating them for the rest of the hike. They are delicious! Other than that, there are a few spots on the hike where it would be really easy to take a tumble that leads to your death, but otherwise, I would highly recommend!!üòÅ",chloe damm
50,"Walk, Jog, MTB to the top",A strenuous climb up the historic trail rewards you with a mile high vista of Southern California and views through the historic telescope delivered by mule way back in 1900.Bring lots of sunscreen and water for this exposed trail.,Jim V
50,Great place,This is a fantastic spot to go see. Very interesting drive through mountains. Your at 5713 feet at top. Fairly easy trails around the observatory. Great for taking pictures. Make sure you get parking pass if you leave your car in lot at top.,mark112018
50,I still have a long way to go.,I keep thinking I want to make it to the top but keep heading out that way on hot days. This is a real nice get away from the busy busy busy Los Angeles Basin.Take at least one bottle of water for every hour you plan to hike and make sure to take your first hike in cool weather and remember to wear a hat.,Robert L
30,Scenic walk,"The Mount Wilson Trail on Mira Monte Avenue in Pasadena is a very sceinc way to see some of the area and get some good exercise, too.",buffalojim67
50,Straight up....,Right from the start. We huffed and puffed for over two hours until we ran out of steam. We were on Wilson Mountain South Trail. I will say the views from up top were incredible and worth the climb.,seetheworld010
40,Long Rocky Trail,"The view at the top is worth the hike but what a hike. 10 miles round trip over perhaps the rockiest trail in all of Sedona. Pick a perfect day, not too hot, not too cool, some clouds but no rain. Trail is exposed. And bring Lots Of Water. And it is Wilson Mountain. Not Mount Wilson.",LifeIsGoodGuy
50,best views without a helicopter,"long hike with lots of elevation but well worth it. snow in the winter and hot in the summer so for me it is seasonal. very little shade so be ready for lots of sun. take plenty of water. trail is well done and easy to follow. for me the best view is the city view which takes a mile off the total hike but the canyon, north, view is also amazing.",brent b
40,Great hike with various terrain,"This hike isn't as popular as others, so if you are looking to avoid the crowds park North of Sedona off the Hwy 89a at the Midgley Bridge parking area. We checked out the view of the bridge and the creek below and then made our way up the Mount Wilson Trail. This is a moderate to difficult hike so be prepared. The trail is well marked and slightly uphill for most of the way. some parts are shaded, but you are mostly in the sun, so wear a hat and bring water. Beautiful views, great exercise, and the quiet calm of the mountains for the most part. I vote they stop the scenic helicopter flights in Sedona because of the noise that echoes on all hikes in the area! The trail did have a sign saying ""No Drone area."" FYI This is the tallest Mountain around Sedona at 7100 feet. The mountain and canyon below are named after a bear hunter named Richard Wilson who was killed there by a grizzly bear back in 1885.",Mahdeeyo
50,Top of Sedona,"Amazing. We climbed from the bridge to the peak even though we hit 6 inches of snow in some parts. What a view. Saw three deer on the way back down. 6 hr, 9 miles and 2500 feet elevation gain.",Shane F
50,Amazing views,"A Great long hike with BEAUTIFUL views! I hiked Mount Wilson for the second times and I want to do as much as I can. The further I get in this trail the beautiful it gets, you can see everything from up there. I have my life there!",Aaron A
50,Excellent trail with several options,"Hiked this trail by first following the branch that goes down by the creek/river, then took the branch that climbs the mountain. A well hiked trail with the usual rocks encountered on most Sedona trails. Views are nice at various points of the hike.",Don49680
50,Beautiful the Entire Time,We did the north trail and went along Mount Wilson to the end of the trail. We skipped the Sedona overlook on this trip (we'll be doing this one again for sure). The trail was amazing with tons of colors. I highly recommend this one in fall.,QuincyFargo
50,Best views I've seen in 7 years of visits,"This trail is fairly easy to follow. If you find yourself scrambling you are off the trail. It takes about 90 minutes of hiking time to get to the junction of Wilson Mt trail and the Wilson mt north trail. It takes 30 minutes from this spot to the vista junction. At the junction you can go to the Sedona Overlook (30 minutes round trip), and/or the Oak Creek Canyon overlook (60 minutes round trip). Both are worth it, and in my opinion you have come too far to not see both. The canyon view is spectacular. You can see Mt Humphrey in Flagstaff. Time out equals time in for a 5 1/2 hour hike not including hang out time. You will absolutely get a workout and a reward.",Judy M
40,Great trail and views but a steep hike and a long one.,This is accessed of Midgley Bridge and is a awesome hike if you can make it to the top of Wilson.Watch out during Monsoons for lightning in the PM.,154benf
50,Mount Wilson in February,"Amazing trail; In February, by choosing this trail, you will avoid the snow and icy cold water of West Fork trail. For us, we went to west fork trail, soaked our boots and returned to this trail to our utter astonishment. This trail is not for kids or faint of heart. It definitely has a steep climb, but then once you are the top, boy the views are mesmerizing. I would recommend this to any thrill seeker, who has a good fitness level and desire to take up a challenge to hike in Mount Wilson and enjoy the vista. Peace",Anup S
50,A rewarding hike,"The entrance to the trail is easy to miss - so remember that it is from the parking lot just north of the only Dairy Queen you will see on highway 89A after SedonaHiked in February, temperatures were decent and the views most remarkable, shade should be decent even in the dead of summer . I feel the ideal time would be April-May when the ground snow that we experienced higher up should have disappeared by then. The climb can be tiring but if you keep it slow & fun with frequent selfie and hydration breaks it's not difficult. We hiked around 4 miles up and were limited by sunset , would have gone further for sure. Carry some snack and couple liters of Gatorade and enjoy the hike . Definitely recommend a selfie-stick !",Chetan W
50,Challenging and Rewarding Hike up Wilson Mountain,"Set aside about 6-7 hours to hike up Wilson Mountain. We hiked up a day after it rained, so the peak upper plain and top mesa had about 6-8 inches of snow. We were the first to hike up that day and so had to find the trail through the snow. Getting to the top was well worth it as we viewed Sedona from the top as well as the surrounding areas. An excellent hike with plenty of switchbacks, and three ecosystems - desert, deciduous, and conifers.",Roland K
50,"Somewhat challenging, mostly uphill, but lovely views!","Wilson Mountain Trail is a gradual uphill climb through scenic views. Bring water... you can walk as far as you like, then turn back and return to the parking.",Laurie.22
40,Rewarding hike close to Sedona,"That was our second time hiking Wilson Mountain. Last year we did the North trail, this year we did the South trail. The South trail has more sun and is a little bit longer. Both trails come together approximately half way up the mountain. There are some flat and steep sections, but overall nothing too difficult. Once you reach the top you are rewarded with a great views of the Sedona area and even the San Francisco mountains north of Flagstaff.",Ruediger S
40,Serious Hikers Only!,"This is a great hike, but it's long, rocky and occasionally steep. It's a three to five our adventure if you take it all the way to the top and to the north end that overlooks Slick Rock Park. The views are amazing and well worth the effort. It's pretty much an out and back trail, so it's easy to turn around when you've had enough. Always bring plenty of water and put on the sunscreen - not much shade on this one.",David J
50,Tough going but the views are so worth it,"We asked for trails that had a high intensity level and by my estimation that's what we got. The map says it's 5.5 miles each way but the going up felt like 10 miles. Jeez, I go to the gym and do bootcamp classes but this trail kicked my butt. Maybe it was the elevation, or the fact that there aren't any hills where I live so I'm just not used to being challenged by an incline.All that complaining and I'd still do it again because the trail is beautiful. We just took our time on the way up and enjoyed the sights. The views are outstanding all along the trail, but commit to going all the way to the Sedona look out. It's amazing! And it's cold, so pack a light jacket or something. We didn't and we were freezing - it even hailed on us at the top. Not sure if that was some kind of freak event or what. I was thankful they were small hail pellets.Time wise, it took us about 4.5 hours to get to the top, and like I said that with lots of stops and picture taking. Then 1.5 hours to get down.",Diane S
50,Beautiful views,Parking can be a challenge but the hike is worth the effort. You can hike down to the Creek then hike up 5.5 miles to the highest mountain top in Sedona.Great hike for photos. And not many other hikers which is a nice treat for the Sedona area.,ScarlettHippie
50,Yes! Best hike in Sedona!,"We hiked the North Wilson Mount trail starting from the picnic area because we wanted part of the hike to be in the shade and protected from the wind. What beautiful views all the way up and then we reached the other side of the mountain and could see the Sedona views too. Beautiful. The ranger's office said it is the most difficult hike in the area, and it is tough, but if you have experience it is worth every step. We continued to the peak and were rewarded for those efforts too. Definitely recommend. Take plenty of water, snacks and poles.",goldfishcastle
50,Senior Stroll,We started at the Midgley Bridge and hiked about a mile in then headed back to the parking area. Being Seniors- we displayed our Seniors National Park pass so parking was free. They have a dispensing machine for your parking at the parking lot. This was a pretty flat trail with beautiful blue rocks in the dry creek bed. Serenity and solitude along the trail- beautiful!,Carol L
50,Beautiful Hike,"We started our climb up Mt. Wilson trail from Midgley Bridge, leaving one car at the bridge and another at Encinoso picnic area in Oak Creek Canyon. We were advised to do this from an experienced hiker. Starting on the Midgley Bridge side is a more gradual climb than the other way around. We did the hike in early November so the weather was cool, otherwise, I think it would have been too intense. Though very challenging due to steepness/altitude gain, the views of Sedona, Oak Creek Canyon and the San Francisco Peaks were breathtaking. We only went up to the plateau and not up to the peak and it still took us about a 4-hour hike doing the loop. On the way down to Encinoso, we found a sweet protected canyon that was full of colorful maples. The fire damage along the way is visible, but we were happy to see all the new growth",Christine C
50,Unique Hike,"This hike is a true gym. Explore the top to see the AMAZING views off the edge of the mountain. This hike was really unique and really rewarding. Great day hike, with plenty of wildlife, shade, and terrain changes. This was a very non-crowded hike and was really enjoyable!",Amy W
40,"Great place to work-out, okay view!","First of all, this trail is steep, constant uphill climbing for miles. I've gone to Orchard camp location twice and it was exhausting. First time was in October and it was mild temperature in Sierra Madre start point but very chilly in the Orchard Camp. Second one was in late May. It was very hot in Sierra Madre start point and cool in Orchard camp. There is very little shaded area until Orchard camp. Some parts of the trail is very narrow and steep, and at the edge of a cliff, you must have hiking shoes with good grip. Also, hiking poles are strongly recommended. Another advice is food and water. Take plenty of water. Multiple your regular water consumption with 1.5, because you will need it ion this trail. Make sure you have some food. During May hike, we saw three snakes, one of the was huge, I think like 5-feet long. There were also some mosquitos in the Orchard camp, got bitten once. I like this place because it is a good work-out, not because it has spectacular view. They also have running race every year during Memorial day weekend, make sure you don't hike that day. There are functioning bathrooms at the beginning of the trail.",Mert51
50,Great hike!,"We started the hike on the North Mount Wilson trail which is accessed by the Encinoso picnic area, up 89A. There are 4 parking spots there, just outside the picnic area gate, for the trailhead. As this hiking area has fire damage, there are many downed trees to go over, under, or around. The first couple of miles are steep, but the views at the top are worth the effort! We went to both the Sedona and Oak Creek overlooks and recommend both. You can see all the way to Jerome, past Sedona, and then all the way to the San Francisco peaks, beyond the canyon.",Amie K
50,Mt. Wilson,"Highly recommend . You can see the Peaks and all of Sedona when you reach the top. One of the best hikes I have been on in Sedona. Would plan around 4 hours. You are suppose to purchases a Red Rock Pass $5, for the day.",HayleyR R
40,avoid the crowds-plenty of parking,"This is a great hike. You will like it better if you go to the northern most Trail Head. Often no spaces available by bridge so travel north about 2 miles to Encinoso Picnic area. About the same distance to the top, but a lot fewer people use this trail. Great views of the San Francisco peaks complete with snow on top. Also, nice views of sedona and Oak Creek.",Ken W
50,"One Tough Hike, but worth it","Wilson Mountain Trail #10 http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=55438&actid=50 is a strenuous 11 mile hike. Expected hiking time is 7-8 hours. The trail begins just beyond the picnic shelter at Midgely Bridge. Then watch for signs to Wilson Mountain not Canyon Trail.This hike heads straight for some of the most panoramic views in the Oak Creek Canyon/Sedona Area. The first mile is a gradual slope but the 2nd covers nearly half of the 2,300' gain.When I got to the top there were a lot of blow downs. At the sign I decided to go left .75 miles to views of scenic canyon country Oak Creek Canyon, Sedona, Coffee Pot Rock,Capitol Butte, Sterlong Canyon and the Verde Valley. I planned to also check out the north edge but because of the downed trees I missed the sign and was one my way down before I realized it.I was on the trail by 6am so didn't feel much heat going up thankfully. I returned about 1. It is very cool to look up at that mountain when you are cruising Sedona and know you've climbed it!!Tip: Someone suggested I go to the Hike House http://thehikehouse.com/ to get hiking ideas. I was glad I did. the owner was much more helpful than any of the visitor centers where I stopped. I bought the Sedona Trails Map and he marked up 3 hikes for me (I had already done Bear Mountain when I found him). Each of the trails was spot on for my skill level.",JayneHikingAddict
40,"Tough, but the best views of Sedona and the Valley","We took the North Wilson Trailhead. The first part of the hike is moderate in challenge. The next part is a series of steep switchbacks (recommend hiking poles for the trip DOWN as there is loose rock). The Sedona overlook is well worth the time; the Wilson Canyon overlook trail goes through some of the remains of the 2006 fire, ending up with a nice view to the north that includes the San Francisco mountains.",Charlie K
50,"Great, difficult hike","This hike takes all day to do right, in its entirety. The views are excellent and the terrain is varied. Red rock, mountain paths, wooded areas and steep ascents are all a part of the hike. It is quite long, at least for the area, and it is one of the steepest climbs around. Very fun though, well worth it. There is an abundance of wildlife at the top of the climb.",Charles
50,Fantastic - But not for the faint of heart!!,"Just hiked the Mt. Wilson Trail (Aug 2012) and it was awesome. The trail takes you through several different types of eco-system. The view from the top is fantastic. The trail is approximately 5 miles and is approximately 2,000 feet vertical. Definitely for those that are in good physical shape. Red Rocks pass is needed but can be purchased at the parking area.",Cynthia M
40,A Challenging HIke,"It's been 10 or more years since I've tackled this hike. It's long and steep, but spectacular. If you're in good physical condition and have the time, it is a great hike and worth the physical effort. Plan on an entire day. Take plenty of water and food. Be prepared for changes in the weather.",YonderMountain
