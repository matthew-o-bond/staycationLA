50,Escape Game,"We did the Wonderland experience and really enjoyed the creativity and fun atmosphere of the rooms & puzzles.We've also done the Court in Session. I recommend that one for newbies over the others.The puzzles were much more complicated than some of the games I have played elsewhere and really make you think outside the box. This isn't your tear apart the room searching for ""stuff"" kind of escape room like The Basement, but more along the lines of Exit Game puzzle solving.The staff is very friendly. They have a cool feature that I've never seen before where you find tokens in your game. The space is quite large and they have parking available for free in the complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
