40,"A small, yet free museum of Tujunga/Sunland History.","I visit many local history museums with my three year old, that we learn of as part of the Passport 2 History program. The Bolton Hall Museum is one of the smaller museums, but it is pretty cool and best of all... free. It's only open Tuesdays and Sundays from 1-4pm, so plan accordingly.The staff was really friendly! The museum is essentially one large room, so while one of the staff members told me about the history of the place, the other staff member (who was amazing with kids!) took my son around and kept him busy... all within my eye sight since it's one room. He absolutely loved her! They have a few cool artifacts and a lot of photos and documents about Tujunga/Sunland. For me, the highlight is the room and the building itself! The outside and the fireplace is made of large rocks, which is very cool. It was particularly cool to see a picture of the man who built it sitting in front of the fireplace that looks the same today!Per usual, with these museums, there's not a ton to do here, but it makes for a nice, interesting outing and change of scenery. This might have gotten 3 stars if it weren't free... but there's also a playground connected to it... so that's pretty great too! While they could have a few more activities for the kids to do and to keep their interest... the woman who watched my son was an A+ and she made gold out of nothing, and I don't know if he would have been happier with anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,"A local historical museum for the ""Little Landers"" settlers in Sunland-Tujuna","Situated in an old stone building, it has been restored to it's past glory. It is the only place dedicated to the community, going back to the early settlers and the Tongva tribe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
