30,Nice bike ride along the Metro Link,"I've been on alot of bike paths, this is one that runs between Lancaster and Palmdale that runs through the desert landscape, along the Metro Link. You will past the famous SKUNK WORKS, and can access alot of activities in Palmdale and Lancaster.",inspectrdad
50,Nice Bike Path,This is one of the beautifully maintained paths of Lancaster's trails system throughout they city. It connects Lancaster and Palmdale along the right-of-way of Sierra Highway.,christian f
40,Nice little trail for riding but not much to see...,Rode the trail often to get to places from Lancaster to Palmdale but we usually headed west to the hills and reservoir on our bikes.Complaint is that it is a city access trail really for commuters - it doesn't really have anything to look at or any destinations.,Sim R
