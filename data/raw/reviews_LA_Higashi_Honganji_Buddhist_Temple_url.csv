50,"Beautiful temple to visit in Little Tokyo, downtown Los Angeles","What a beautiful place to visit in downtown Los Angeles. Beautiful temple, nice and friendly ministers who are willing to show visitors the temple and answer any questions. Feel free to walk in if you are curious about Buddhism or just want to check out the temple. They have their own parking lot. They treated me like family. Definitely check out the annual obon festival which is always the last weekend of July!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byrony664
