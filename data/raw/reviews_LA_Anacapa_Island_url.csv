50,Island Packers outdoes themselves!,"I had high expectations going into today after such a great trip earlier in the week to Santa Cruz. Well, needless to say, Island Packers did not disappoint! After a concerning start where we were told we might not be able to land on the island, the crew pulled through for what was an absolutely perfect day of sunshine.Once arriving on the island (the captain was awesome btw), Morgan led the majority of the travelers on a guided hike. Not being a fan of large groups (mostly because I find people talking to each other when the speaker is presenting extremely rude and it irritates me so I just choose not to participate), I started out on my own. I was fortunate enough to find Lindsay, a volunteer, leading a smaller group of people in the opposite direction. They graciously took me in and Lindsay provided outstanding knowledge and insight along the hike. We even saw a few whales along the way! Thank you, Morgan and Lindsay, for sharing your knowledge of the islands with everyone!I will say, the steps to the top are not the easiest. There are roughly 150 steps, so if you are can not do one flight of steps at home, then this is not the trip for you. Once to the top, the trails are pretty easy. They are well maintained and fairly flat. Definitely pack a lunch and plan to sit anywhere on the island for some amazing views.",Nicholas J. Wendling
50,Take the cruise,Anacapa is filled with little easy trails. The seagulls argue the lighthouse beeps every 14 seconds. Pinnipeds bark. The flowers bloom.It’s a magical trip.,barkus1968
40,Enchanting Cruise to Anacapa,"We took the Island Packers Wildlife Watching tour to Anacapa out of Ventura Harbor. The rocky island is a remote and scenic place - hard to believe we were so close to the city! We were traveling with a wheelchair so we didn't go up onto the island as it is rugged terrain and it's necessary to climb many stairs to get up to the hiking trail from the water level. Our cruise was wonderful - friendly, helpful staff gave educational narration. We saw dolphins, seals, sea lions, garabaldi fish, great blue heron, pelicans and thousands of other seabirds. Note that the visitor center for Channel Islands National Park is located at the Ventura Harbor.",CrankingChick
50,GREAT DAY TRIP,We had four national parks left to visit and we would have hit all parks in the continental United States. All parks have their own flavor and differences. I recommend this as a great day trip.,LuvToTravel0899
40,Small National Park Island Preserve Off Of Ventura,"As you approach, you think there are 3 islands here. But there's really only one - all connected below the sea level. However, in most instances, you will be relegated to tour only on the eastern islet. the other 2 islets are preserves for the seals, sea lions, and sea bird life. Sail here on your own or else you will sign up with Island Packers, the official tour concessionaire for the National Park Service. Note that you must walk up a high stairway from the boat to reach the bluff. If you want to camp, you must inquire beforehand. Daytrippers should prepare for a whole day on a rather small island with really only one figure 8 type hiking trail. There's little shade and just a couple of ranger type personnel on the island. The only beach is at the main dock, and that's not much. But you can swim, snorkel, kayak here in addition to the short hike. So bring a bunch to eat and drink. Binocs would come in handy. Maybe some reading material. Most times, the Island Packer boat departs for the mainland at about 4 PM. Island Packers monitors the daily weather and cancels trips in foul weather and very choppy seas. But on a nice day, of which there are many, you'll see thousands of dolphins and a whale or two.",Zoom_Gotti
50,"Rugged cliffs, great hike!","The smallest of the channel islands, Anacapa can be reached by the Island Packers boat company in Ventura. On our hour boatride out we saw dolphins and a lot of salt spray ( it was choppy!) Its 157 steps from the dock to the island proper, but the hikes once you are up there are quite easy. Lost of squawking gulls with adolescent young but they leave you alone if you stay on the trails. Cathederal Cove and Inspiration Point are more than worth the hike. Your must bring in and pack out everything so take lots of water and sunscreen!",DebRussell49
50,Awesome,What an adventure! Started with ride over and back with Island Packer boat-fantastic group. Once reach Island one must climb up short ladder to dock and then climb 156 stairs so be in decent physical shape. There were hundreds of sea gulls nesting. They continually squawk as you walk by their nest. Suggest first timers like us take ranger led informative hike. There is lot to know about the little island. The ranger was really good. Bring plenty of water and food. So wish we could do other islands but Anacapa was great!!!,bli1220
50,a magical place,"it's hard to believe just how close you are to Los Angeles. This seems like a world away. There were few people around and we could explore this wonderful and rugged island. The Anacapa lighthouse was built in 1912; the last major light station to be built on the west coast. A park ranger talked about the bio diversity and much of what we were about to see on our hike. The coastline is spectacular. There's been very little rain here and it shows. But in-between the seemingly dried out landscape were lovely flowers, etc. You can take numerous hikes depending on your level of energy. Photo ops abound. Lots of seabirds. Bring water and sun protection.",Marion W
50,Giant coreopsis,"What I remember most about Anacapa Island was its biological diversity, particularly as represented by chest-high giant coreopsis flowers, which are much smaller on the mainland. There were many cool sea caves too.",califcasl
50,Wild and Remote California,"Anacapa Island is located about an hour's boat ride from Oxnard. Island Packers offers trips year round. Once you dock on East Anacapa, you must climb from the boat up a steel-rung ladder to a dock, then climb 157 stairs to the top of the island.East Anacapa is a small island, perfect for a half- or full-day of exploring. There are two miles of trails, a figure eight-shaped trail system is relatively flat and easy but offers dramatic overlooks, magnificent coastal views, and the last permanent lighthouse built on the West Coast. Given the sheer cliffs that make up the island, the only ocean access is via the stairs at the landing dock. There isn't a beach, but it is a great place to swim and explore the giant kelp forest and marine life.There is a small visitor's center. Camping and pit toilets are available, but otherwise there are no goods, services, or accommodations available on the island. You must bring your own food and supplies, and pack those out when you leave.",Susie1028
50,Poor mans Galápagos Islands!,Poor mans Galápagos Islands. Unique in diversity of plant and animal life among the Channel Islands. Go to the National Park headquarters at the Ventura harbor and view the film and explore the exhibits before your island excursion.Only a short boat ride away. Do select a clear calm day as the ocean can get rough and stormy at a moments notice. Draminine or the patch are always handy. Whales and dolphins are not uncommon on the way out.Pack food and water and layers of clothing. The weather can change throughout the day. From cool to windy and very warm. Challenging to forecast the day.Fantastic place.,Cavydad
50,Worth the boat ride to see,It is a long boat ride out to the island. The boat was going fast and the best place to sit was in the back to avoid getting sick. the island was beautiful. we saw 4 blue whales on the way back and the staff was very informed and shared information with us. We stayed longer than we probably should have but it was unusual so the staff went out of their way for us.,Daretha11
50,Galápagos of North America,"When I first heard that Channel Islands is the Galápagos of North America, I wonder if it would meet my expectation since I already hiked all the Galápagos Islands. Luckily it did!Due to high waves, kayak not permitted. For kayakers, you can rent a single kayak for $25/day, double kayak for $35/day. Island Packers (boat) can deliver for you at $20 round trip.High waves made a lot of passengers very sick, and some sprayed wet by the waves while sitting outside the boat during riding. Make sure you wear raincoat, rain hat, take sea sick medication before boat ride if that helps you. If you take medication during boat ride, it doesn’t work!Also, sitting on the back part of the boat will diminish the sea sick effect. Don’t sit inside even if you get sprayed by waves!No way to get to Arch Stone unless by kayak. Be careful with the waves. Safety first!Upon arrival, must climb 157 steps of stairs up the cliff. Of course, must be able to climb down too. If you want to do snorkeling, you would have to climb few more times since this is the only access to the ocean. No lifeguard.Lighthouse is as near as you can get to, see photo. Loud horn may deafen your ear so you can’t get closer.Restroom are great considering this is a nature reserve. Toilet paper and seat cover provided. No water. Just sanitizer. No shower room if you plan to camp or snorkel.Lots of benches around so no need to sit on ground. No need to bring your own beach chairs. But tables and benches lots of bird poops, so be aware.Cove was super windy and inspiration point fantastically beautiful. Sit and enjoy their captivating beauty.End-May is gull egg and chick hatching season, and the gulls are very noisy with their quarks to protect their young. Make sure you don’t step on their eggs or chicks even if walking on dirt trail. They sometimes build their nests on the trail (sorry, they don’t understand road signs).Please note Anacapa is the largest gull breeding colony in the world! There are millions of them on site. Amazing.Lots of beautiful flowers too for flower lovers like me. I won’t consider them wild flowers as I have grown them at home too.If you are a fast hiker, you can ride the 9am boat there and take the 2 or 2:30pm boat back. If you want to do it leisurely, take the 5pm boat. That’s what I did.This’s my first visit to Channel Islands and very impressed. Will be checking out the other islands soon.",AngyChin
40,An overall solid experience,The boat ride and getting off the boat was a lot of fun. The guides were great and the history was interesting. However Anacapa is quite desolate. There are no trees and very little other vegetation in January. The views were great looking toward the next island and back at Anacapa from the boat. The day trip was fun but camping would be quite boring.,DawgExplorer
50,Go in the spring to see unlimited seagulls nesting,"Takes an hour to cross the channel, the seas can be rough so take 2 Dramamine if you get queasy at sea. Gulls wall-to-wall in May, squaking to scare you away from their nest and eggs so go easy on them and stay clear. Island Packers in Ventura Harbor is the place to book the trip over, they have reasonable prices and frequent schedules. Camping only, no places to stay over, but not much to do anyway except commune with nature. Careful going off and on the boat, the ladder can be tricky but the boat crew will help you find the footing.",ANonyMouse45
50,the gulls are the main attraction on this big rock (not really an island!),"we spent a few hours here, which was more than enough time to explore the entire rock. we hesitate to call it an island as you have to climb up 139 steps to reach the top. in rough seas you cannot disembark. it's very nice on the rock. we saw the gulls, but came a month to soon based on other reviews and what we learned while on the tour. very informative tour guide. the scenery is excellent, but it would have been nice to be able to hike a bit more. Maybe next time we'll head over to the larger channel islands - santa rosa or santa cruz. anacapa is definitely worth the trip for the gulls, but don't expect to do much hiking. some of the other travelers were camping on the rock. we can't imagine why - there is very little to do while there unless you are interested in looking at seagulls all day. hey, to each his own, right?!",joemontana16
50,Gull nesting season on Anacapa,"Anacapa is the nearest of the Channel Islands, and although it's small, it has one of the most attractive features: Gull nesting. During May and early June thousands of Gulls are nesting on the ground there and you walk along trails through large groups of momma birds 'very worried' you're going to harm their very cute puffball babies. There's no real danger, but you'll get much verbal objection! Of course there's always Inspration Point, a postcard view of which I never tire. Don't forget, the grand secret of the Channel Islands is the boat ride over. I have been there over a dozen times, and have never failed to see at leas one large superpod (>500) of dolphins, a sunfish, and/or whales.",Paul M
50,We love Scuba Diving in Anacapa,"We love scuba diving in Anacapa. Great kelp forests,caves, tuns of sea life, even have seal encounters. We love, love, love scuba diving in Anacapa! One of our favorite dive spots in southern California! Come dive, snorkel in Anacapa, you will fall in love with the world down under👌🏻👍🏻 🦀",WSJSS
50,Birds Galore,"The place is spectacular in its remoteness. We were there in early June and the Western Gulls were nest and hatching their young by the thousands. There are about 2 miles of trails on the islands so if you're doing a day trip, you'll have plenty of time to experience the island and visitor's center. Remember to pack your lunch and bring liquids because nothing is available on the island. You must also be able to navigate a few metal steps to get out of the boat and then several flights of metal steps to get to the top. It was beautiful and if you like to study and view birds, this is your place. On one side of the island, you can look over the cliff and see the sea lion colony on the beach. We're glad we went!",Steven N
50,California's gold.,"This was a great day trip. Ferry ride was fantastic especially since we had a fin whale swim right by our boat. The island is very small but was great to explore. Lots of seagulls nesting all over the island. Scenery from every part of the island was spectacular but especially from inspiration point. We packed a picnic and some wine and enjoyed it overlooking the beautiful vista. Quite of blooms still left on the island. The ""out houses"" are quite clean.",siouxsy
50,A Wonder of the West Coast,"The boat ride was rough. The weather was drizzling and gloomy all morning. The fog was so thick that I stopped being able to see the coast of Oxnard after just a few minutes. But as soon as that little boat docked at Anacapa Island, I knew it was all worth it. Immediately upon arriving to the island I see massive cliffs of volcanic rock and literal thousands of seagulls. We climbed the stairs to the top of the island and you could see fields of yellow flowers and jagged peaks of the other part of the island. The tour the park ranger gave was probably only about 2 hours, and the island is small, but I'd definitely recommend visiting if you're ever in Ventura County area. It's the closest island and the only without natural water, but still a dramatic, diverse landscape well worth visiting.",Jackson H
50,Great Day Trip!,"I plan to see all the US National Parks at some point, and while in LA I took a day trip to Anacapa, Channel Islands. Suggest you do research on all 5 islands and the ferry schedule/options before you go. The park service encourages day-trippers to choose Anacapa, and was perfect timing for me. I enjoyed the day very much, but I honestly don’t think this island will be of interest to everyone, so I'm going to list some negatives/positives below:NEGATIVES: You’ll need to be able to climb 6-7 flights of stairs to access the island from the ferry dock. The island is small and you are confined to a flat trail which can be done in few hours. You'll arrive before 10:30am, but the return ferry doesn’t leave until 3pm. The island is small with very limited plants or wildlife (particularly in September). There is no shade, so wear sunscreen, dress accordingly, and bring water to stay hydrated. There is not a shop on the island, just a very small visitor exhibit (no attendant), clean restrooms (but no running water), and a very small area for camping overnight (should anyone be that adventurous). You can tell from the smell and looking at the ground that the island is used heavily by birds in the Spring as a primary nesting spot. There is also a working lighthouse that emits a loud warning tone for ships every 14 seconds; with a sign instructing visitors not to get too close to the lighthouse or risk hearing damage.POSITIVES: The ferry rides to/from are an enjoyable part of the trip with knowledgeable guides, who stopped to show us 2 schools of dolphins and were on lookout for whales. We took the Island Packers ferry from Oxnard. They also circled the south side of island at the end of day close to Pelican Arch which provided some excellent views and photos of sea lions and nesting pelicans. On the island, the vistas from Inspiration Point which is the farthest point away from the dock are wonderful and the highlight of the island experience. Definitely recommend you hike to the other side of island and stay there for as long as possible before the 3pm return ferry. While I didn’t kayak, snorkel, scuba, or even swim, my understanding is that this would be a fantastic treat in the water areas around the island and heard the ferry guides and others on the trip speak of sea caves viewable from kayaking and great snorkeling. I'll find a way to enjoy the water if I return. We brought a picnic lunch which we enjoyed on the picnic tables by the visitor exhibit. It was great to see the greenery restoration activity that is taking place due to the drought, as evidenced by few workers at a small greenhouse near the park ranger lodge.OVERALL, some might not see the charm of Anacapa due to the harshness of island, but it depends on your interests and expectations. I enjoyed it and wouldn’t have missed it.",Toby-Likes-Travel
30,It depends on what you are looking for -- it can be good or bad,"To like Channel Islands National Park, you need to like water. The beauty and the activities are best enjoyed from a kayak or a boat. If you like hiking or other land activities, this is not the park for you. We visited Anapaca island and there really isn't much there. It's a small island that is basically a large, flat rock. There is no trees or shade except next to some small buildings. The entire figure 8 hiking / walking trail is probably 2 miles long. While the scenery of the coast and the ocean is very nice, it's a very small place and can be explored in a couple of hours, max. It's hard to get to because you need to pay to get a ferry there, and on many days, it's only one trip out and one trip back, so you have to wait until 3:30 before your ride comes to take you back. The terrain is very flat so there are no ""surprise views"" as you come around the bend. There is no service except for a bathroom and a very small visitor center exhibit. You must bring any water or food you need to consume during your day there. In the spring, I'm told there are tons of birds that nest and gather there, to the point of not being suitable for humans. On the other hands, we saw some kayakers and some in small private boats having an excellent time exploring the shore from below and explore sea caves. Some were swimming off of the boat. There are under water marine sanctuaries for snorkeling or scuba diving. Essentially, if you stick to the land portion, it's not that interesting.",viperflt
30,september dullness,"came here for my birthday so we can check off this park and found the entire planning tedious and the hike itself unappealing. first of is transportation. there is only one boating company that brings people to the islands so schedules are limited. on my selected day of hike, i either had stay overnight on the island because pick up is in the morning or i should stay in the island for 4hours because pick up is at that time only. without a guide during the hike to provide information, share trivia or narrate stories about the island, the hike itself might only take an hour, but even with one- it took us way less than the 4hours. secondly, there is no shade (a few buildings closer to the shore) on the island (no trees, no other small buildings in the middle part) and the entire hike was flat. unfortunately, september must be one of the worst time to visit. there is no color to the island- just plain brown and everything appears dry or dying. i saw a few birds, and the water is super blue from afar but this island was even creepier than when we were dropped off at alcatraz. even without prison bars, it is not entirely impossible to feel claustrophobic here, especially with the 4hours attachment and no water source. that aside, inspiration point is beautiful, the ranger assured us it is lovelier other times of the year and there is at least a pit toilet with only a toilet paper and gel sanitizer",mTan66
50,Plenty to see,"Our visit to Anacapa was a day well spent. The ride over and back with Island Packers was enjoyable; we were fortunate to have calm waters and not too strong of a breeze. Three varieties of dolphin and an ocean sun fish were spotted during the voyages; the captain kindly slowed down for a good look and the naturalist on board provided insight into what we were seeing. Once on the island, the views were amazing. We took advantage of the park ranger's guided tour along the figure eight trail. His talk was informative and he had answers to questions ranging from history to geology. After the talk, we wandered back to the visitors' center, stopping for a picnic with a stunning view at one of the few benches along the trail, and a stop as close as possible to the lighthouse. Back at the visitors' center, we enjoyed chatting with the volunteers at the native plant shade house, the basic but informative displays and the cleanest pit toilets on the planet. After hours spent sweating in the direct sunlight, we regretted not bringing swim gear so we could explore the kelp forest off the boat dock. Both of us would consider returning after the rainy season to enjoy the greenery and explore by kayak. If you go: Know that this is not a ""fancy"" national park site. Away from the visitors' center, there is no shade. No running water is available. To access the island from the boat dock one must be able to climb 157 stairs. If you wish to swim, the water is accessed by a ladder from the dock; there is no beach access. During July and August, the island is a nursery for thousands of sea birds, so expect the smells and sounds that go with that. The odor of guano persists at least into September. However, a visit will reward you with a leisurely walk surrounded by beautiful views and a day's escape from the bustle of the city.",LittleBrownBird
50,Memorable trip,"Our day started at Island Packers in Oxnard. The boat trip out and back was smooth and fast. Saw a group of dolphins and one whale of in the distance. The cliffs and vistas are great, but the island looks bad due to the drought. The birds were gone when we were there. I did get some great photos. The only place the trail would get close enough to the cliffs to see down was at Inspiration Point. This one location was the highlight of the trip. The park guide was great, he seemed to enjoy his job. Take food or buy it on the boat. On the boat trip back we purchased a needed beer, nice treat.",Mark D
50,Amazing boat ride to seagull island,"My husband surprised me with this trip for my birthday and it was fantastic! The boat ride to Anacapa alone was spectacular. We had recently moved from Maui and really missed being near the ocean. Having lived in Maui for 5 years we got used to going out to seeing the humpback whales every winter. Because of this I didn't expect much from the whale watching excursion on the way to Anacapa island. I was so wrong! We saw common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and even a humpback whale that was fin slapping and did a beautiful breach!The island itself was unique with it's majestic cliffs and gorgeous views. We went during nesting season for the seagulls so they were extra protective and yes it didn't smell great on a few parts of the trails. But it was really cool to see that many seagulls, how cute the babies are and how protective they are of their young.There's no shade so make sure to bring sunscreen and hats! It quickly turns from hot in the sun to cold in the tiny rest shade area near the dock so bring a sweater as well. We brought a back pack with lot of water and snacks. If you eat a large breakfast and bring snacks you're good for the day.",Lady_Glady
50,"Sea kyacking, swimming, kelp forest, island strolls and of course birds!","The best way to do this island is through Santa Barbara Adventure Company. The ferry ride out is part of the experience. We saw swordfish, dolphins and sea lions on the way. The ferry goes by the famous arch. Once dropped off, we prepped for sea kyacking and were immediately rewarded with views, kyacking under the arch, and really cool tunnels/ caves. The guides are very helpful and tell you interesting facts about the area and the environment. After the kyacking, we went up to the island for lunch. When you see the island, it's best if you understand it first, so you can appreciate it. Without this island, there would be no sea birds in Southern California. This is a safe reserve for sea birds to nest. There are birds everywhere. There are a couple of easy trails to take you the distance of the island, but this is not for the hard core hiker. The hiking is not shaded, and barren surroundings. Because of all the birds, I would not recommend sleeping on the island. After the hike, we went to experience the kelp forest. Grab some goggles and float around the cove where the boat dropped you off. The kelp has made a gorgeous underwater forest that is worth a quick dip to check out. This island is much more interesting if being on the island is secondary to your main event, eg, kayaking. If being on the island is your main event, you may be disappointed.",Sondra W
10,Photos are deceiving!,"My husband and I have lived in Ventura for about year and wanted to take a trip to the Islands, Anacapa is the closest. We looked into it online and there are beautiful photos everywhere of a lush green peaceful island with great hiking. We took the boat out on Island Packers, which was a nice ride and they do stop to see whales, dolphins, etc. We saw a Swordfish and some Dolphins. We arrived to the island and you do have to climb up quite a bit of stairs from the boat so if you have trouble with stairs, think again. Once you get up there is a small visitor center and an overwhelming smell of urine and feces. We thought it might get better and proceeded on our hike. We didn't use a guide but she did give us an overview before we took off and mentioned there are some dead birds on the trail. We proceeded on the trail and the island is completely barren. No green, no plant life, nothing. Just thousands and thousands of Seagulls. The seagulls were very overwhelming and creepy, just squaking everywhere. Bird poo everywhere. When we got over to the other side of the island on the trail, the wind changed so the smell slightly improved. There are breathtaking views of the other islands and cliffs. That part was great. The hike is a very short figure 8. We got back to the lunch area and we were honestly disgusted to eat. You also have to haul all of your own trash back with you so make sure you bring ample space in a backpack if you do decided to come here. I would recommend a half day, as you can finish the entire walk in about an hour and half walking slowly and stopping. There really isn't anything else to do there. At the end, I asked the guide about why it was so barren and so many birds. She said that the birds have no predators, the biggest mammal on this island is field mice. They also breed here and she said we came at the end of the season and it can be 10 times worse during the breeding season. They are very aggressive and you have to walk around with your hands up to protect yourself. With the drought going on 5 years, the plant life has really taken a decline to pretty much nothing. She did say the other islands aren't like this and we do want to check out Santa Cruz which does have vegetation and foxes, and more hiking. (oh, and less birds!). All in all, it was definitely something to see but I would not go back or recommend this to a friend. If you do go to Anacapa, I would highly recommend the kayaking tour because you don't get up onto the island, you kayak around it and in it's beautiful caves. You would not have to deal with the above mentioned negatives and I think that would be a great trip. If you are planning a visit, definitely do the kayaking instead!",Alyssa S
40,So many sea gulls,"We took the early cruise out to Anacapa. The fog was pretty heavy on the way out but lifted for better views closer to noon. The views of the arch and Inspiration Point are beautiful. These are the iconic Channel Islands views you see on the merchandise so it's neat to see them in person. You really don't need more than a couple of hours to explore all of the trails. The visitors center is tiny and there isn't shade so be prepared. If you go in July the sea gulls are still nesting. There are loud, smelly birds everywhere. I've never seen so many in my life & we live near the beach. Seeing the young babies was kind of cool, but if birds aren't your thing you are out of luck.",KLnavig8r
50,Great island for bird wildlife,"You get to the island via Island Packers in Ventura or Oxnard. Between March and July you will see the entire breeding cycle of the Western Gulls from making their nest, breeding, laying eggs, and watching them hatch and grow until they fledge in July.In several coves you will also see hundreds of California sea lions from different viewpoints on the island. When the boat picks you up they take you around the corner to the back side and you see the famous Arch with more birds send hundreds of sea lions sunning themselves on the rocks and beaches.If you are lucky in summers you will see pods of dolphins and maybe whales. We saw several 100 dolphins scattered around the boat and a couple of humpback whales.",ItchyFeet
30,"No shade, too many birds, too noisy","You should visit this island only if you are a bird lover. We went on a day trip with Island Packers. The boat trips were fine. But when we arrived, there was no park service person to give a guided hike. We were just left on our own. The Sea Gulls were nesting and protecting their baby sea gulls. There were literally thousands of them, constantly squawking and they were aggressive. There are many stairs to climb to get to the top, and there is NO shade anywhere on the island. We enjoyed Santa Cruz island much more.",Chuck Brooks
50,"If you like birds and wildlife, then this is for you!","Being on Ancapa Island, as part of the Channel Islands National Park was a great adventure. It started from Ventura California, where you take an Island Packers boat and take a 45 minute trip to the island. Along the way, you can spot harbour seals, many, many dolphins, a lot of them swimming along with the boat, and even a whale albeit in the distance. Whilst on the island we were able to see many seagulls nesting, some of them still laying on their eggs, whilst others already with their chicks. There is a clearly defined trail to inspiration point, a must-see whilst here as it provides a panorama of the other parts of the island. There were also some seals that can be heard and seen along the seashore below.Overall, a very amazing experience.",ralr99
50,Anacapa Island Wildlife Cruise,"I took the island wildlife cruise at 9:30 a.m. with Island Packers for $38, but our boat stopped by Anacapa Island to drop off people who were doing the day trip ($59) or going camping for the night ($79). On our way to the island, we saw a few humpback whales and when we arrived to Anacapa, we also saw a cute little sea lion on the pier. We continued with the wildlife cruise after dropping off several passengers and we toured around East Anacapa where we saw the lighthouse and Arch Rock. There were many seals and sea lions hanging out by some rocks around that area. Next, we cruised to Middle Anacapa Island where we saw lots of caves and the areas where different shipwrecks occurred. Along the way to West Anacapa, we saw Keyhole Rock and Frenchys Cove as well. These were the highlights of the tour around Anacapa Island, but one of my favorite moments was on our way back to Oxnard Harbor. We saw a pod of dolphins swimming alongside our boat and hundreds of them just jumping out of the water. It was really unforgettable and I will be back to Anacapa for a day trip next time so that I can actually have the chance to get off the boat and explore/hike on the island. I recommend this cruise to anyone considering a visit to the beautiful Channel Islands!",Annemae B
40,A day trip starting with a boat ride followed by a easy stroll around the island,"Got on the boat ride from the Ventura harbor, it was smooth and fun especially when we spotted a whale and a school of dolphins. They stopped the boat to wait for the whale to come up, and stayed long enough for us to enjoy watching the whale and the dolphins run. The island is full of seagulls and their poops are everywhere, the ""hike"" is flat and easy, it's really just lazy walk. There are a few vista points worth seeing, the Inspiration Point is a must visit. Just follow the trail behind the visitor center heading the opposite direction of the light house and you can't miss it. You'll have about 4 hours on the island before boarding the return trip, and that is more than enough time to explore the island. Make sure you pack your lunch and plenty of water, the island doesn't have any store you can buy things from - it doesn't even have running water and there is no trash can anywhere so you need to take your own trash back to the harbor.",TonyChao
50,An island for a day!,"We enjoyed a day of hiking on the island. We took our time and stopped at the different overlooks since you are there around 4 hours. Pick up a walking guide near the visitor center or you can go with a ranger. Walk up to the lighthouse. There are a lot of seagulls. We went during mating season. Just don't get near their eggs or they start gawking, so keep on walking. They didn't disturb us while we ate our lunch or even the entire time. (Do bring your own lunch and drinks & pack out your garbage). Anacapa is great for families and children. On the return trip, the boat guide stopped so we can view a humpback whale. On the way over, the dolphins were swimming next to the boat. What an awesome day with Island Packers Tour!",happy traveler
30,"Not enough hiking to justify an entire day, and seagulls are very annoying.","We were dropped off by Island Packers for approximately 4.5 hours on the island, and the highlight of the excursion may have been the photo op of Arch Rock and the sea lions after we were picked up. The island is beautiful, but we nearly hiked all the limited number of trails twice in our time there and could have easily done so if that was our goal. Inspiration Point is very awe inspiring, and the lighthouse and other cliff side views also make for good photos. The seagulls are absolutely everywhere though, with their annoying squawking and the ever present smell of their guano. This is probably a good island for those traveling with young children or those who may have problems with the hiking on Santa Cruz, as the hikes are pretty easy and you can see everything you want to see within your time window. They do have seagull deterrent rotating flags on the picnic tables, so you can eat your lunch in peace and without the mess.In short, go to Santa Cruz or one of the other islands if you can.",parksvisitor
40,Beautiful day on the island,"Anacapa Island was one of the only trips available on short notice that you didn't have to jump off a skiff to land so we booked a trip. We made a reservation one day early but during busy season I'm sure you will need more notice.Ranger Bill was a delight and very knowledgeable. You have about 4 hours on the island, which is PLENTY of time to walk around, eat lunch, walk around again, and leave. I recommend going but I would go to a different island next time to either hike and/or kayak.",Emilie D
30,Ranger Danny saved our trip!,"We visited Anacapa in the spring of 2008 and much enjoyed hiking around soaking up the amazing views out over the Pacific and downthe sheer cliffs, surrounded by (invasive) beautiful blooming ice plants. We camped overnight, the only humans save the (invisible) ranger. Yes, seagulls nesting Everywhere, literally every few yards. Bird poop everywhere (& sitting, cooking) was a challenge. Still, an exceptionally beautiful experience.Revisiting in July 2015 to camp again, we found a gray and barren rock, reeking of seagulls and seagull poop in the blowing dust. The beautiful ice plants were gone, removed and replaced with native plants. A noble effort, but bad timing with the drought and no plant life survived at all. The thousands of gulls on the tiny island had thousands of young birds in their nests. Yay! HOWEVER, for us as visitors it meant the adult birds were extremely aggressive. Yes, think Hitchcock. Even walking very slowly, we would have adult flap and fly around and even dive bomb us. I took one short walk alone and did not repeat. We were also told that if we moved too fast we might scare one of the fledglings off their home nest and into another bird's territory - where they might well be pecked to death. Yikes! The winds (smelly, dusty) were so bad that first afternoon they blew down / broke our non-low profile tent. I was ready to catch the return ferry back. My companions insisted we stay overnight :-(Enter the Ranger, a young Asian guy whose name I think was Danny. Where the ranger was invisible our first trip, Danny made it his mission to make sure all visitors had a good time and left with a better understanding of the islands. He loaned us snorkeling gear and wetsuits and we enjoyed exploring the beautiful, interesting cove / kelp forest at the dock. That evening, he invited all the campers to an improv ""Channel Islands"" movie showing on the outside of the visitor center with his personal equipment of LCD projector, laptop, and canvas tarp. He was personable, knowledgeable, and very helpful. Completely AWESOME, and saved our trip.",Teardrop26
50,Unspoiled island close by,"This is one day trip that was truly unique! So near Los Angeles but it feels we were so far away from civilazation. The animals at this island were not afraid of humans. They were everywhere and it was such a delight to be so close to them. The ferry ride was not bad but bring a thick jacket or sweater it could be chilly during the ride in the morning. Remember this is at the Pacific Ocean. Bring water and food for hiking and pack light since hiking is the only way to see the beauty of the island. Also sunblock, sunglasses and hat. First aid kit is a must since there are no stores here. The view on top of the mountain was breathtaking. The water that surrounds the islands is so blue and clear. We can see the small marine wildlife from the cliff. It is fairly a steep climb everywhere on the island so be sure to wear comfortable hiking footwear. Restrooms are portable ones and are just located at the base. This is one trip that is really back to the basics. We are planning to go back and visit the other islands.",Maria2628
50,Enjoyable day trip,"Lovely hike. Enjoyed ferry over saw several whales. Stayed w national park tour guide. Reinforced 6graders lesson on earth science, tectonic plates, beautiful views. Upside of nov. tour was no birds nesting which may be prominent in spring time. Definitely great family time.",ciaobellascd
50,Sea lions on the beaches,"You land at the foot of a rocky cliff and climb several flights of stairs to the top, which is a barren desert tableland. The views are stunning on all directions, and especially so at the far end of the island, where one stands and sees the length of the Channel Island archipelago--islands stretching out to the horizon. We went on our hands and knees to the edges of the very sheer, very high cliffs, and when we looked over, we could see dozens of sea lions basking in the sun and playing in the waves. A splendid spot.",CHEB15
50,Fantastic visit,Enjoyed the boat ride out with Island Packers to Anacapa. Great hike around the island - even with the nesting birds. Relaxing day trip with a nice picnic overlooking the pacific. Don't miss a chance to see this place.,LSUTraveller
50,Anacapa Island is Captivating!,"We went on the Anacapa Island Ferry Tour, as this was the remaining tour for reservations one day in advance in mid-August. The ferry was clean and comfortable and crew members were accommodating and knowledgeable. Because this is a National Park, the history of the island and environmental conservation of the area were emphasized. I liked that there was no one trying to ""peddle"" anything. The marina and information/ticketing office were both easy to access and informative. I look forward to visiting again for hiking!",Gomer14
20,Best part of visit is the Island packers ferry,"We went to East Anacapa Island for 1 day trip starting with Island Packers ferry in morning. Ferry turned to be best part of the trip! We saw seals and dolphins from very close. Once we arrived on the Island, fun factor dropped drastically. Island is filled of bird poop and smelled horrible with too many birds around. There is a 2 mile hike with beautiful views but the overall ambience with stinky smell kills the fun. No shed or pit stops to enjoy the hike. Before long, we were waiting for the ferry back!There were people that enjoyed scuba, snorkeling etc.",Sachin M
40,Inspiration on Anacapa,"Take the Island Packers to East Anacapa Island. Check to make sure the swells are not to big otherwise you may not be able to get off at the landing spot. There is no spot to anchor so they back the boat up to the landing and you have to jump off. Not a big deal if things are calm. The hike out to Inspiration Point is easy and lives up to its name. The campground is usually empty during the week. There is no shade or water so bring your own. Try and go when the seagulls are nesting and the chicks have hatched, your kids will love seeing all the little ones.",SBHaydens
50,Great Scuba off the coast,"I should start this by stating I haven't set foot on Anacapa Island, I have only dived around the fringes.As such, it's an excellent spot to enjoy kelp forests, unique sea life and, of course, the Sea Lions. The water is coolish - 17 degrees C/63 f when we were there so a good thick wetsuit is recommended, and go with a reputable dive provider - we used Spectre boat dive from Ventura - as a good safe day with a hot tub on the boat makes it even more fun.",scubal0ver
30,good for a short hike,"The boat ride out to the island was awesome (we saw dolphins, seals, and rare blue whales), but the actual island was very small and a bit hectic with all the nesting birds. I did enjoy walking around the island once but found that after an hour or two I was ready to go back since my head was ringing with the squawking of the seagulls!",Thestarsweare
50,Scuba Diving,"Great location to Scuba Dive. We loved every minute of it. Boaters, please be aware of what a Dive Flag looks like!We saw seals, which played with us, tons of sea urchins and large scallops. Pretty day to be diving. Visibility was 40 feet. We will be back here July 11 & 26-2015 and bringing some friends.",WSJSS
10,Camping at Anacapa (Seagull) Island,"We had 2 nights reserved for camping at Anacapa to spend the July 4th holiday weekend - however, the trip was so terrible we actually came home one day early. Where to start... first off, I can't believe that people who have reviewed Anacapa don't speak to the amount of birds there are on this island. The seagulls lurched around our campsite 24/7 aggressively trying to steal any food they could get their beaks on, while constantly squawking and pooping. If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay, avoid Anacapa at all costs. The seagulls never stopped squawking, even throughout the night. Unfortunately there was pretty bad wind and our tent suffered some damage - the zipper door wouldn't shut the whole way. So, between the foghorn that sounds every 10 seconds (literally, I counted), the seagulls screaming bloody murder and trying to sneak into our tent, we had pretty much the worst night ever. I just scrolled through the slideshow pictures of Anacapa from Island Packers' website - wow, false advertisement! Someone must have photo-shopped all of the seagulls out! Sorry but we're not talking beautiful, exotic rare birds here... these are gross, ridiculously loud seagulls for crying out loud! This place was like the set of an Alfred Hitchcock movie - what a nightmare! The stench on the island is unreal - the seagulls have an endless supply of fresh poop locked and loaded and are ready to release a sh-- storm on you at any given moment. With no running water available on the island, you can see the dilemma! The wind was pretty unreal - 20 knots - meaning your tent will need to be tied down in numerous places and the island turns into a dust bowl. So basically, I recommend this place if you are deaf, have an impaired sense of smell, and a burning desire to experience a day in the life of a seagull.",slindchris
50,Every bit as beautiful as the pictures,Visited in May when the seagull chicks are hatching - excellent! Park ranger Danny deserves all the credit for making it a great trip - providing insight into the island's past and encourage snorkeling which was my so ca trip highlight. Camping 1night is best because you are virtually alone at inspiration point when the boat leaves.,Moquecas
50,Naturally Beautiful!,"This is a wonderful, beautiful island off of the coast of Ventura, CA. It only takes about an hour to get out there, via Island Packers boats. In the spring, many birds make their nests on this island because there are no predators. There are also no trees so they are all around your feet, and on the sides of the trails. They are mostly sea gulls and pelicans. You can even see the eggs in the nests! This is a small island, less than 2 miles, in a circular trail. The views the whole walk are spectacular since you can see the beautiful Pacific ocean all around you. You might even see a whale or two go by. On the way out to the island, we saw 2 Gray Whales and 3 Humpback whales, so that was an extra treat. There is also a beautiful working lighthouse to see. You board the Island Packers boat in the morning, they bring you out to the island and you can walk around for 3-4 hours, and then they come and pick you back up. Just bring your own food and drinks in a backpack. If you want a day trip, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",Donna L H
40,Anniversary Dive Day,Great place to dive. Kelp and open areas. Sand Dollars and lobsters to look at. Visibility depends on the season.,TheGatesClan
40,A double bonus trip on that day,"We were on a impulsive long weekend trip to Solvang, Santa Barbara and Ventura. The last, but not the least important was the trip to Anacapa Island on the last day. The trip was booked through Island Packers. We were well in time for the boat ride. There were about 50 people booked on the medium sized boat. When we started there was a strong off shore wind and the day was bright and sunny.The initial safety and trip briefing was very functional. We were told not to leave any trash on the island and not to pick any trophies or mementos from there. The web site of Island Packers had also advised people to carry enough water and food since there is nothing for purchase there.The Skipper of the boat made a disclaimer statement that landing on Anacapa may not be possible if the wind speed remained high. After about an hour or so, he stated again that the wind speed is high and probably we will go around the island and look for Grey whales. Meanwhile a few playful dolphins were sighted and there was general excitement on board. The first bonus!We were all on watch for grey whales. as we turned around the northern tip of Anacapa, voila, we started sighting whales. We saw about six of them. Three tail lashes and a lot of spouts were seen. This was surely the second bonus!As we were cruising along the east coast, we sighted a few juvenile Sea lions basking in the sun. We rounded the island from the Eastern side and meanwhile the wind also subsided.The skipper took us alongside and we were allowed to get off on the island at about 12:30 PM with a stern reminder that we will start back at 3:00PM.The boat never ties onto the pontoon or steps at Anacapa. The skipper keeps it dynamically in position for people to get off and get on. The crew is very helpful in getting people off and bringing them in. all the Small babies, children, adults and old people made it safely both ways.We did not have much time to explore the island, but manages to go to the major view points such as ""Inspiration point"", lighthouse etc. A variety of seagulls, Californian Pelicans, Eagles, sparrows etc were sighted on the island.The people made it back to the boat in time and we started back by 3:15 PM. We were back at our starting point by 4:30 PM.Normally the boat ride is direct from the start point to the Island landing point and back. We were lucky to add on whale viewing, seeing dolphins and sea lions.",KCAjith
50,I had no idea this was there,"One of the most spectacular places I have traveled EVER! I had no idea it was so close to me. Could easily do a week seeing all of these islands. Fascinating nature stuff, and amazing views! Can't wait to go back and see other islands. Naturalists with the Parks Service and Island Packers are great as well.",Sara C
40,A stimulating naturalistic experience in the Channel Islands,"This short trip on the Island Packers' Vanguard with Capt. Dave and his knowledgeable assistants begins a process and experience that few can rival. To prepare ourselves for this brief nautical voyage we stopped at the Channel Islands Aquatic Center to view an extraordinarily well produced and narrated twenty-five minute film.Our odyssey began at Ventura harbor where a number of us boarded a fifty foot motor launch that was to take us across calm seas to Anacapa Island. The island, a small one of volcanic origin, lies about eleven miles off the Southern California coast, west of Ventura. It provides a critical habitat for various seabirds, namely gulls, brown pelicans, gannets, and blue footed boobies among others.Aboard the Vanguard our attention was drawn to passing humpback whales, seals, sea lions, and countless playful dolphins dashing in every imaginable direction.We landed at a specially created dock built on the leeward side of Anacapa Island on cliffs plunging straight down into the sea. We hiked the trails on the island for several hours with our small backpacks and water bottles before being picked up again by Capt. Dave on a subsequent Vanguard trip.After a brief look at Arch Rock, a short greeting to a number of hearty kayakers, and a short appreciation tour of the beautiful clear waters at the western edge of the island with the sea lions basking on sunny rocks, we were off to Ventura and home again.Highly recommended!",Leonard K
30,Nice day out but very bare & dry,"We went out for a day trip to Anapaca island in July. We used Island Packers for the boat trip from Oxnard - well organised and great ride with commentry. We saw dolphins swimming and playing with our boat! The island itself was a little disappointing - we didn't realise that there is no source of water on the island so the landscape is very bare and rough. As we came in July there weren't any flowers in bloom so it was really just rocks, dust and dry shrubbs. We enjoyed hiking across the island (its a brief and easy hike) and the views towards the other parts of the island were stunning. We had a ranger walking with us telling is interesting facts about the local plants and restoration efforts. Some people in the group went kayaking but we just opted for the hikes. We saw sea lions as well as otters, and the island is mainly inhabited by birds as breading ground. The sea gulls were everywhere!! It was extremely cute to watch the little ones learn how to fly (we actually sat and just watched them for quite some time), but on the flip side there are bird droppings everywhere and it stank. We also saw brown pelicans. In summary it was a nice day out, saw plenty of sea life and I really enjoyed it, but next time I would try and go in spring (to see the blossoms). Also, remember to bring food and drinks as there are no shops on the island (but you can buy some on the boat). Also, there are a few steep steps at the landing site so make sure you are ok to get up before booking this. There is a little island map you can download on the NPS website.",NicLondon1
30,Great Boat Ride,We Had a great day out there but not alot to do make sure you take bathers water and best maybe a kayak,LindsayThorpe
50,Easy Hike Island,"Same fare to a couple of the Channel Islands but this has the easiest hike overall. Even for inexperience hikers, the 3 hours spent on the island is more than enough time to hike the entire island from end to end. The only rough parts are the 150+ steps of the stairs onto the island and the bumpy boat rides. Fair warning: it is an island full of (sea)gulls, and like any other national parks, pack it in, pack it out. The only down side during the visit was that the lower trails were closed due to the gulls & their younglings... Otherwise, the trails are loops, & no access to the lighthouse. Did see some dolphins and sharks during the ferry rides.",agilor
50,What a Great Boat Ride!,"We came upon this special experience by accident. Joined a 10:00 boat that went out to Anacapa and then came back (we weren't prepared to hike but it looked great). We saw dolphins, sea lions, seals and an amazing flock of brown pelicans with their little hatchlings. The explanations from the crew were very good and when we cornered one of them to really push on his knowledge, he was very impressive. Lovely way to spend a morning and then go out to lunch.",Jim L
50,So happy to finally explore East Anacapa Island!,"I've lived in So. CA all of my life and have visited Catalina a few times but, for some reason, the Channel Islands always escaped me. I don't know why I always conjured up a vision of only being able to view this island by kayak (unfortunately, I'm not kidding!).We decided to visit East Anacapa Island and arrived by boat via Island Packers out of Oxnard. The crew and ride over were great, and it was wonderful when they slowed the boat down so we could see and photograph a huge pod of dolphins midway to Anacapa. The boat ride over was only one hour long. Please note that when you arrive at the island and decide to disembark, there are several flights of stairs that must be climbed straight up to the island from the boat, but it was a manageable stair climb to the top. (For those of you not in the best of shape, there is a small overlook landing at several points up if you need to take a quick breather. Pretend that you're enjoying the view!)A very friendly young park ranger greeted us when we arrived on the island, giving us a lot of info and offering to give an interpretive walking tour of the island.We missed the Spring bloom season, but arriving the first week of June meant that we saw the Western gull hatchlings! They were EVERYWHERE and so darn cute, but please note that the mama seagulls are instinctively protective. It was amazing to see how many babies there were there. I am a photographer but I was a complete fool that day...I left my Nikon at home and brought only a point-and-shoot. SUCH a dumb idea. If possible......BRING YOUR DSLR AND YOUR ZOOM LENS! It's amazingly camera-worthy.The hike around the island was flat and easy on a well-marked trail. Inspiration Point (about a mile from our starting point?) is gorgeous and a must-see stop, as is seeing the lighthouse at the opposite end of this small island.There are restrooms, a small visitors center, and picnic tables on the island. Please bring your own lunch and water because there is no food or water available for purchase.Some of the reviewers didn't care for the odor from the birds but Anacapa is a bird sanctuary! We are intruding on THEIR land. Honestly, I felt that it was all part of the experience.We had an additional treat on our boat ride back when Island Packers took us around to the back side of the island so we could see the sea lions sunbathing. (Ugh....and I didn't have my zoom lens!!!) But this added to our experience.I highly recommend that everyone devote a day to explore this island. It was a unique experience and such a great day.",Sharon L
50,Awesome Experience!!,"I've lived in California for many years and have often thought of visiting the Channel Islands but just didn't know that much about it. Well I finally went with a friend and boy was it amazing. I booked a ticket on the Island Packers ferry. It's about an hour to Anacapa and $59 round trip. I really didn't know what to expect except I knew to bring a picnic lunch and there were no concessions on the island. When we arrived we saw so many sea gulls sitting on nests. The nests were scattered all over the island and in plain view as there are only low plants/shrubs. Each nest had 1-3 eggs. We saw one chick as it was hatching. Several had baby chicks. They were beautiful. It was fascinating to see so many sea gulls in one place. The views are amazing and Inspiration Point lives up to it's name. The gravel figure eight trail is about 2-1/2 miles round trip. It's an easy walk. There are some slight hills. When the boat docks you do have to walk up about 150 steps to the trail. Do not miss this. They say there are different times to go to the island - spring has the flower blooms, late May/June has the sea gulls. There are also sea lions and seals to watch as well. Fantastic day!!!",iheartnuevo
40,Nature at it's best,"We visited Anacapa Island 4-6-14, also through Island Packers. We got lucky- calm seas, sunny weather and 75 degrees. One hour boat ride went fast, we sat on top for better views. Hiking is easy, and walking every trail you can do in less than 2 hours. The gulls were nesting, and flowers in bloom. The only downside was the KELP FLIES! They were annoying, but we were told that thet are only there for a short period of time. Island Packers staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make the trip go smooth. If there was a suggestion - it would be to shorten the trip one hour, you end up waiting because you have seen the whole island. On the boat ride back, we saw a pod of dolphins that numbered in the thousands!",Dano72
40,A Great Day,"We traveled to the national park with Island Packers departing from Oxnard at 9:30 AM. The weather was great and the seas were relatively calm. The boat trip is about 90 minutes each way. The time expands depending on weather and what the captain can find along the way. As we headed out we were joined by what appeared to be over 100 common dolphins who played in the boat's wake or swam along side the boat. Our captain kept his eye on the horizon looking for any whales that might be migrating north. We struck gold when contact with a whale watching excursion boat let the captain know there was a pod of Orcas near by. Off we went to see if we could spot them too. Not only did we see the family of five, we had about 45 minutes of up-close viewing. Apparently they were over a kill site and hadn't finished breakfast. We had a schedule to meet (kind of) so off we headed to Anacapa.Once docked we had the opportunity to join a ranger talk, but we chose to set out on our own.We hiked the island from one end to the other. Other than the nearly vertical scramble to the visitor center, the hiking is easy. There are four named trails that join to form a figure-eight. The longest trail is a six mile round trip. The wildlife is abundant. There are threatened or endangered plants, birds, especially brown pelicans, and animals, including California sea lions, sheltering on the island. Because of the drought, only a few of the coreopsis had flowers. I can only imagine how spectacular it looks when they are all in full bloom. That would be worth the price of admission all by itself.You need to bring your own food and water. Port-a-potties are available. The point here is to keep the island as natural as possible. Even the research station and lighthouse try to minimize their impact on the island. As we left the island our captain took time to ensure everyone had an opportunity to photograph the iconic arch then whisked us back to Oxnard for a 4:30 PM docking.",Davis K
50,A Must See,"Anacapa Island is amazing. From Anacapa Island, you can see the other islands of Channel Islands, seals and elephant seals, sea gulls and cormorants. The national park staffs there are very nice and friendly. They will also bring you to see the whales. My only suggestion is visiting there at spring or summer. Cause in winter, the island is bold and the view is not so good enough.",SSLOVEKK
40,A Delightful Voyage to Anacapa Island,"Our fascinating trip started at 10 AM and we were back by 5 pm. The cost was $60 and wellworth it. Most of the islands off the California coast have very unique ecosystems and theAnacapa Island, whose arch is the Channel islands National Park logo, is no exception. Going over, our trip guide was able to identify and stop for viewing, the numerous kinds of fish, sharks and dolphins as well as birds. The island is also the largest rookery for the California Brown Pelican in the spring time. The very abundent birdlife does give the place birdy odor, but it is worth it for its pure beauty and abundance of sea bird species. Be sure to take the naturalist guided walk. We viewed seal colonies, and what must have been a shark nursery as well as beautiful jagged cliffs with crashing waves and the accompanying symphony of ocean wavessloshing against them. There are no concessions on the island but food and drinks can be purchased on the boat.A note to back packers....this is not the place. In fact we saw a couple leave. The camping area here is very exposed, in a bowl without sea view and very harsh. It is much better to campon Santa Cruz.. The rangers on Anacapa are very friendly and nowledgeable. Remember you have to pack in all your own water and take out all your trash. Be prepared to climb over 160 steps on a railed staircase from the boat. There is no wheel chair access.In a word, I would return....bird [--] and all.",Christie C
40,Go in the right season!,"The beautiful pictures of Inspiration Point attracted me to Anacapa Island. Unfortunately, due to the timing of my trip (in July) and the lack of rain earlier in the year, the island looked totally brown with very little greenery that would have made the scenery much better. The Island Packers boat ride from Oxnard was still worth it and we saw dolphins swimming close to our boat. One thing I regretted not doing was to sign up for kayaking before boarding the boat to the island. The kayaking would have added more fun to the trip. The 2-hour guided hike to Inspiration Point was interesting, with the stop at Sea Lion Cove and the end point (Inspiration Point) the most memorable.",snorkelingJim
40,Anacapa: Where Nature Rules,"Our trip to Anacapa was supposed to be the highlight of our vacation to southern California. We started out by visiting the National Park Visitor Center in Ventura, then headed to Island Packers, the park's concessionaire, with our hats, lunch and water. The eleven mile boat ride was uneventful ... a few pelicans, an oil rig and a thick marine fog. Our arrival at the Landing Cove brought high hopes -- deep blue water with kelp forests and a blowhole. We climbed up the steps for a birds' eye view of the volcanic rock that makes up the island .. .and then, we were met with a cacophony of seabirds and what the National Park calls ""telltale guano."" We knew immediately this was not the standard national park. We bought one of the guides and set off to explore with a vague sense of disappointment. The path is narrow, but not rugged, and along the way the seabirds continued their fierce protest. Upon arrival at Cathedral Cove, with its awe-inspiring views of the sea lions and scuba divers, any tinges of regret soon faded. At our next major stop, Inspiration Point, we viewed the other, inaccessible islets and felt that overwhelming insight: So this is Nature without the trappings. We found a bench (be sure to bring something to sit on and then dispose) and sat a long time, looking over the surging water. Simon Winchester's words were written for the Atlantic, but they equally apply to Anacapa: ""There were no ships' wakes on the sea, no aircraft trails on the sky -- just cool incessant wind, the cries of the birds, and the imagined edge of the known world set down somewhere, far beyond my range of sight."" It was the highlight of our trip, we just didn't realize what it had to offer until we had come home and had to deal with the day-to-day world: Serenity.",pma03
40,"Beautiful views, easy hiking","If you have looked at other reviews, you will understand that this trip is not for everyone. We went out to Anacapa by boat with Island Packers. We each had a small day pack with all our gear including a wide-brimmed hat, two bottles of water and a sack lunch. We pre-ordered the lunch from the Harbor Cove Cafe a short drive beyond the check in office building. You will find outhouses on the island, but no other facilities and no water. Don't expect a tropical island with shade trees! There is no shade. What you will find are beautiful views of the Anacapa Lighthouse, Inspiration Point and the kelp beds. We arrived at a time when the fledgling Western Gulls (thousands of them) were trying out their wings. By July, they are as big as their parents with a few of the wispy down feathers left on their heads. The coreopsis is now dormant and the dying branches are the perfect camouflage for the birds who blend in with the rocks and the vegetation. We took an hour long hike with a volunteer from the National Parks and then wandered around on our own. The most difficult part of the trip was the climb up the almost 160 stairs to the top of the island. But there are opportunities to rest and you can take all the time you need. On the trip back to Ventura, we saw the Natural Arches Bridge and spotted lots of porpoises, sea lions and brown pelicans.",motile
40,What are you waiting for?....GO Now!!,"I have lived in Southern California all my life and have vacationed on Catalina Island several times, but never Anacapa Island - Channel Islands National Park, CA. We took an hour long whale watching trip out to Anacapa. Our view was the high cliff dwelling birds, awesome detached and attached land formations, and the site of the kelp beds in the beautiful clear ocean. You step off the boat and make your way up the cliff climbing about 160 steps. The guide was wonderful with his extensive island knowledge and then you can walk the length of the island on your own. There were seagulls nesting all over the island with their eggs and/or baby chicks. Brown pelicans also nest on the cliffs. There are a few historic Spanish buildings and a lighthouse on the island.Next visit we will take the kayaking trip to this island. This is a wonderful island to kayak due to the caves, cliff views, clear water, and just the beauty of the entire island.",bonbuild
10,Disappointing,I am shocked this is a National Park. Compared to the other national parks that I have visited this park was a huge disappointment. The island was full of birds and bird feces. This is more of a bird sanctuary than anything.,BRYAN H
20,Not as much as we expected,"We had higher expectations of the trip. Per what had been read, we expected unique wildflowers and wildlife. Consistent with what had been read: tons of birds and their droppings.The trip out (to Anacapa) was a nice trip including sightings of a few whales. Once at the island, a tour was available with a guide from the boat company. We stayed with her for a short while, hearing that the only animals on this island were birds due to a lack of fresh water source. (We however did see lizards on our own). There were limited places to sit and enjoy the views that weren't covered with bird droppings. The lighthouse also had a fog horn which sounds about every 15 seconds. There were two options when we were in the area--for a shorter or longer trip. I had believed the shorter trip would not allow us enough time. If we had taken the shorter trip, it may have been better. The time we were there was much too long. Like so many things, going into it with the right expectations makes such a difference. There is some interesting plant life -- although we believe we saw similar/same things the rest of our time in CA; the island / island chain is unique... It wasn't the highlight of our trip, more like it was just something we did. We would not return nor would we recommend our friends/family take the same trip we did.If you are able to kayak or such-- or maybe go to some of the islands farther out, it may be a better experience.",Missy99
50,"A beautiful world, right off the coast","Volcanic islands that rise straight up out of the ocean. Anancapa is the easy one. Closest, with some nice and easy trails around the plateau at the top. The trip out on the boat took maybe an hour, and was easy, if a little cool. As one would hope, we saw two pods of dolphins, and for one of them the captain slowed down and the dolphins started surfing in the boat wake. Very cool! Also saw seals periodically as well. Once at the island, the walk up the stairs from the boat dock is several stories, but not bad, and plenty of places to sit and rest on the way up if needed.What is really surprising is how few people go out here. The NPS says they only get around 50K people a year out there. On the day we were there, the weather was fabulous, and there was maybe 25 folks out there to do some volunteer restoration work, and maybe 25 tourists like us. So very UNcrowded. We had an NPS guide take us around, a very enjoyable short hike.Be sure to pick the time of year to see what you want to see. Our March visit allowed us to see the coreopsis in bloom, which is spectacular. Sort of short trees, with huge flowering heads, they covers the island. At other times of year, one can see the seagull nests with eggs, and then chicks wandering around.On the return trip, a few folks saw a grey whale in the distance that breached just a couple times. The transport folks were great.",Godzilladude
50,Seagulls with a view...,This island adventure was spectacular with a seagulls at various stages of development. A variety of short hiking trails with one leading the lighthouse.,tracy805
50,Anacapa Island - a daytime adventure,"Anacapa is a terrific introduction to the Channel Islands National Park. They have very friendly rangers that will give you a tour of the structures, museum and lighthouse on the east end of the island. Great snorkeling and diving, as well as good fishing on the back side. Hiking is limited, however there are some great caves that can be explored by kayak and tide pools on the south side of the island. Frenchy's cove is an ideal spot if you are visiting via a private boat or charter company. You can camp overnight on the island, but beware it can be windy. If you seek desolation a night on Anacapa fits the bill.",Sean Q
50,Noisy Anacapa,"Our visit to the island was on a balmy afternoon last spring. There were many, many sea gulls with eggs and chicks. It took a while to get accustom to their squawing. The walk was not difficult and the views were breath taking. We could have easily stayed another hour or two.",pearl350
50,Great whales!,Boat ride is long. Only went around island - no landing. But we saw a lot of cetaceans. Would go again.,winetripper
50,Dreamlike,"Simply unbelievably beautiful, lots of sea birds, close to ocean, a very narrow island. All natural, no development.",PlanetValentine
50,Nature Walk,"I might get married here. Inspiration Point is exactly what it states-gives you inspiration. Lots of stairs to get to the top, but once up, views are awesome.",Robin B
50,Anacapa Paradise,"If you have the opportunity to travel out to Anacapa Island, take it! It is beautiful, relaxing, the views are GORGEOUS and there is lots to explore!",Christine Y
50,Desert island without sand,"Very interesting trip to a place that is very bleak but doesn't look it because of the birds and scrub vegetation. But there's no water and so the birds are about the only thing going. If you can't get up a lot of steps and do an uphill hike after that, don't try it. But otherwise, it's really worth a visit and the views are wonderful at the top.",Judith M
50,Lighthouse + sea arch + nesting seagulls,"I took a day trip (8:30 - 4:30) to the island with Island Packers with my 80+ year old mother and teenage son.The boat trip from the Oxnard harbor takes about 60 minutes. We saw lots of dolphins and a few whales on the way over and back.A naturalist meets the boat and gives an overview of the island and then later leads a 60 minute walk to Inspiration Point which anyone can join (no charge). The tour was excellent with lots of information on plant life and history of the island (former sheep ranch).There is a visitor center, patio with picnic tables, toilets, storage lockers, and a camp area. There is no drinking fountain.What to take:Water (there is no water on the island)Good soled shoes for walking rocky pathsDress in layers because it is cool on the boat and warm once you start hikingPicnic lunch (no food service on island although you can buy drinks, ice cream, and microwaveable food on the boat)Best time to visit:February or March to see the Coreopsis in bloomJune to see the seagulls nestingNeed to know:The boat does not dock. You disembark from a rocking boat via a ladder and then hike up steep stairs. The cliff edges are steep and there are no railings; stay behind the railroad ties.On the return boat trip, we passed around the east end of the island to get good views of the sea arch and the beach where there are sea lions.The day trip was fabulous but about one hour too long. There is a figure 8 path around the island and 2 hours is enough time to walk the path, take photos, and have a picnic lunch.",pricklypoppy
40,Anacapa Island From A Distance,"Haven't been on this island yet, but beautiful to see from boat. Cool rock formation.",WellHelloBaby
40,Incredible natural beauty,"Anacapa is part of the Channel Islands Park and has incredible rugged natural beauty and interesting sea life in the tidal pools. It is very difficult to reach except by tour boat and once you arrive, there are no facilities at all. Unlike its larger sister next door, Santa Cruz, Anacapa has been pretty much left in its natural state. Come well prepared for some extreme hiking and temperature changes and bring plenty of water.",John N
50,Like another world,"You will feel like on another planet, only 11 miles from shore but totally unique. If you like nature you will like this island. Hike, have lunch and then come home for a great daytime.There are stairs from the dock, after that fairly level.",tmd_11
30,Mother Natur3e Lives Here,The trip there and back with Island Packers is fine. The island is pretty bleek. Not a whole lot of animal life or birds to take photos of. It's a nice way to spent the week-end.,Larry L
50,Island,"This is a tranquill, natural place, wonderful for a boat ride out to experience natures beauty and the diving out here is amazing",glassgirl3
50,Fun trip,"The hikes on the island were great. We got a little sick on the boat, so beware it can be a choppy 1 hr ride there. Overall, had a great time.",marimily1
40,"Wonderful ride, scary cliffs!",This island is dramatic and has a lot of birds with a barren landscape. The cliffs are what will drive you nuts if you have young children with you. Try Santa Cruz island instead - flatter trails!,KatherineP
40,Relaxing end to our California Vacation,"The Channel Islands are one of the least visited and isolated of all of our National Parks. That is the exact reason my wife and I chose this as the last stop for our California vacation. It does take about an hour boat ride to make it to Anacapa Island, the closest of the Channel Island to the California Coast. We departed from the Island Packers docks at 9am. Once past the breakwater, it did get a bit choppy so you may want to bring dramamine or a simliar medication if you get seasick easily. Once on the island, we had 4 hours to explore. We chose to hike out to Inspiration Point with the ranger who explained the history, flora and fauna of the islands along the way. We decided to picnic at the point since the view was just beautiful. This island is a breeding ground for the California Gull, so expect hundreds of birds and noise...especially if you hike too close to any chicks are in the immediate area.This is a very isolated place so make sure to bring plenty of water. Sunscreen and a good pair of shoes that can be used for hiking are also essential. A camera is maybe the most important part of any trip here since the scenery is absolutley amazing.Our captain ended our journey to Anacapa by cruising past Arch Rock and getting close to groups of sea lions that sun upon the rocky beaches there. The trip back to the mainland was much less choppy than the outgoing trip and made for a relaxing end to a perfect day. I'm not sure if we would spend the time and effort to get out to the islands again, but we are glad that we did take the time to do it at least once!",Paul R
50,Wildflower Season is a highlight!,"Anacapa is a group of 3 islands. The east island is the only one that allows visitors. It is a small island but has spectacular vistas - - the best being Inspiration Point at the very western most point of the eastern island. It is about a 1 1/2 mile roundtrip loop from the landing dock to Inspiration Point so there isn't much if you are looking for hardcore hiking.I am giving this island a 5 out of 5 because of the beautiful vistas & especially the wildflowers, specifically the giant coreopsis that covers the entire island - - the most extensive flowers are from the center of the island til right near Inspiration Point. If you come to Anacapa, I highly recommend coming during the wildflower season which is typically in late winter or early Spring. I suggest calling the Channel Islands Visitor's Center in Ventura and ask them the condition of the wildflowers because the exact time of bloom is different every year. The coreopsis blooms in only a short time period (only a few weeks per year).If you come to Anacapa outside of the wildflower season, you will mainly be coming for the ocean vistas. There won't be any beautiful plants or flowers to see because the island is mainly grass & ice plants. There aren't any trees on this island meaning ZERO shade.One really good vista that many people do not know about is right near the campground. If you are heading from the dock/lighthouse area, head towards Inspiration Point and about 1/2 way there is a campground with 2 outhouses. Once you get to the campground (right before the outhouses), you will see a trail on your left-hand side that has a bit of an incline. At the top of the rocky incline is a beautiful vista of the south side of the island (opposite side of the mainland). HIGHLY recommended!One piece of advice, bring insect repellent because on our return, our entire boat was inundated with annoying flies.",love2travelcheap
50,Small Island Big views,"Although small in size, if you are looking for a great view of the Pacific ocean and surrounding islands then this is it. The flora and fauna are also unique to this place. In spring it is a Western Gull nesting habitat, and the Endangered Brown Pelicans also nest here. The ride out varies in scenery and intensity depending on the weather and the whales or dolphins. We saw 100's of dolphins on out ride out, and one small Gray whale. There are trails to different vista points around the island. Sparse camping can be done if set up before hand with the National Park Service. Anything you pack in you have to pack out. Bring all water and food with you.",NationalParksTrails
50,Walking around Anacapa Island,"Boat leaves from Channel Islands Harbor, Oxnard. Trip takes an hour, maybe longer if the captain finds Whales to watch. The Island is completely made up of tall cliffs. No beach access. Anything that is accessible has Sea Lions on it and are protected. There are trails on top of the Islands with magnificent views of the cliffs, ocean, and other islands. This island is a Sea Gull colony during the spring, and although I was there before the nesting season it it supposed to be an awesome sight when thousands of gulls are nesting everywhere. Only port-o-poties on the island. Bring your own water and food. Great way to spend the day. We saw 100.s of common dolphins on the way out to the island and 1 gray whale.",NationalParksTrails
40,Beautiful but small,"I went to Anacapa Island in mid May. It is a great place to take pictures of the island chain, sea gulls and the landscape covered in ice plants. The island itself is small enough to walk and take the guided hike in a few hours.I took the morning ferry and came back at the end of the day, and felt like that was too much time. I ended up walking the island twice, eating lunch (bring your own food/drink), taking a lot of pictures and had time left over to sit around.There is no access to beaches and you get to the water by ladder from the boat dock. Also the sea gull eggs had not started hatching when we were there, but the park ranger said they would start soon.I also went to santa cruz and you can easily spend a day hiking or enjoying the water. Kayaking took up most of my time there.",Traveler15486
50,Cruise for the Birds,"Channels Islands National Park consists of five islands off the coast of southern California. The visitor center is in Ventura, Ca and from the harbor there you can take a one hour boat ride eleven miles to East Anacapa Island. A peaceful silence surrounds the tile-roofed buildings below the lighthouse on the cliff. It is a silence pierced by the cry from a gull flying overhead or the bellow of a male sea lion on the beach below the cliffs. History, wildlife and wonderfull scenery awaits as you explore the island alone or on a ranger-guided walk. Return to Ventura harbor in the late afternoon. A wonderful and relaxing way to spend a spring or summer day.",travels2c
50,Enjoy the Gulls!,"If you're looking for a quick, affordable getaway, Anacapa Island is a great escape, and not too far away. I'd hiked this island about 10 years ago, and visiting it again was well-rewarded with the proficiency of our naturalist, who was engaging and well-informed.Transportation and use of the guide was provided by Island Packers, who offer a variety of excursions to all the Channel Islands. We left from Oxnard, and the boat ride was only about an hour. If you're lucky, whale, sea lion and dolphin sightings are an added bonus.Particularly delightful were the density of sea gulls who were nesting, their cacophony of squawking telling us who really rules the roost on this charming island.",grathy
