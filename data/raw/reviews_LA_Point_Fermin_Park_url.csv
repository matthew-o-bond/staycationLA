50,"A sunny afternoon, new place with a delicious view...","Well it became more delicious with the arrival of an ice cream vendor pushing his cart on the sidewalk. We both got a Vanilla with a Chocolate coat on a stick, that did not melt too quickly in the hot afternoon temperature. The view from here is terrific, across is Catalina Island, looking so much closer than the 26 miles. Cruise liners are temporarily moored at sea.can count 6, oil tankers as well with 9. No place for them to offload their cargo, oil is now a glut here, storage a problem. Tall trees, shade, flowers tuned this into a longer than expected walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz
50,SUNSET,"Most people go the the park for the beautiful lighthouse, which I LOVE, but I go mostly for the SUNSETS and MOONSETS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmanlarry
40,Nice quick visit,We drove up here to see views of the ocean and to see the lighthouse. It was a last minute decision. The lighthouse is closed on Monday’s. There are beautiful magnolia trees there. And spectacular views. I think the sunken city is around there. But we forgot to explore for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5453RXmichelles
50,"Point Fermin Park should be a ""must see"" if you are in San Pedro.","I was really blown away by this little park. It's a short distance from the Korean, American Friendship bell. You can see the park in under an hour. The ocean vistas are amazing. I would like to see a sunset here. There are high cliffs that give you great shoreline views and you can see large ships entering and leaving the harbor in San Pedro. I would imagine at the right times there are whales and porpoises visible from the heights.There is a beautiful old lighthouse on the point. There is free parking, Places to picnic and rest rooms available.This is well worth a stop if you are in San Pedro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
50,Amazing Sunset,The park was so Beautiful and clean...besides an ocean breeze the views of the ocean were Amazing...perfect place for a picnic with an ocean view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelacZ3583RK
50,Beautiful scenic around the park,"Point Fermin Park in San Pedro, California must be one of closest parks right next to the Pacific Ocean. Most of the access to the cliffs were closed off but adventurous people like myself found ways to get around. I highly do not recommend this!! The cliffs are unstable and can fall at any time. But when you reach the waters on the bottom it’s all worth it! That’s what risk taking is all about! Just wish people wouldn’t graffiti such a beautiful place! Its like if time never changed at the cliffs. Thousands of years ago, it may have looked the same! A place to relax for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CambodiaTravelsGuide
40,Nice Park,Surrounding the lighthouse you have this nice peaceful park. There are overlooks that give you nice views of the ocean. Picnic areas and an amphitheater. Pleasant place to sit and chill for a little while. There's a handful of parking spots by the park but seems like it'd fill up quick. Don't forget to hike up the hill a bit to check out the Friendship Bell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Catalina seems to float offshore!,Catalina seems to float offshore. Grand spot to sit and view Catalina as well as shops entering the harbor. Great place for a picnic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Quiet and pleasant on weekdays,"I have lived in Los Angeles for 45 years and never knew until today that this park existed. It is rather pleasant. It overlooks the ocean with large expanses of lawn. It was nice to see children and their mothers enjoying themselves here. On the east end of the park one can see a bit of the Sunken City. The cliffs are quite steep here...thus, there is no way to get down to the beach from the park. The only trouble interferring with the park might be the wind...I am suspicious that it might be windy here ALL the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
50,Amazing area and light house had awesome history!!,"Love the history of the lighthouse. It is not what we generally expect a lighthouse looks like. Free tour and explanation of the history of the building and area. Amazing stories and views, Definitely visit if you are near. Awesome tour guide!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fr0stiex
40,Breathtaking Pacific Views,"This small San Pedro park provides breathtaking views of the Pacific from atop the rugged bluffs. In addition to the paved cliff walkway, there are picnic pavilions and small amphitheater with bench seating. Used by lots of runners. This is the home of a historical landmark, the Point Fermin Lighthhouse. Very sad to see suicide prevention signage everywhere along the cliffs and the graffiti on the picnic tables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Napunani
30,Pacific and Catalina Island views,"A nice small park with a paved walkway around the top of the cliff, and some partially covered picnic tables along the seaward side of the walk. Also a number of trees in the grassy area behind the walkway. Rest rooms, and parking available. The lighthouse is there too, but on a Sunday afternoon it was closed. Good water views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
50,Coastal Bluffs With Unobstructed View,Wonderful waking path along the Bluffs. Ample parking along the road. Small diner on the South end of the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cynthia-LAX
50,Great place to decompress,"The ample shade trees, picnic tables, and cool green grass makes this a great place for a quiet picnic or a time to let the little ones burn off some energy. The view of the water is spectacular and if your lucky and the season is right you may see a whale or two. Relatively clean and free from homeless camps, this is a plus for a southern California free admission site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
50,VIEW!,"The ocean, Catalina Island in the distance, the breeze, this place is great to spend some quiet 'down time' resting from 'playing tourist'. Just spend an hour on a picnic, or reading, or just listening to the surf to recharge the batteries before another round of touring!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/938hollyc
40,Really nice place,"It was a nice day, took some friends here and had a great time, beautiful weather and lots of fun people around. Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ranbud
50,AWESOME VIEWS AND FEELING NATURE,"Fermin is one of my go-to places to take in the power of the ocean and nature. It just out towards Catalina and provides fantastic vistas up and down the coast. When the surf is up the power of the ocean can be felt way up the bluffs. A great spot for a picnic, photography, ocean & pelican watching, taking in the model airplane/glider flyers and on and on. Worth a trip. Worth a stop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
40,GREAT OCEAN VIEWS,"The park is very nice and the old lighthouse is really nice to see, lots of trees and grass with a small play ground for the kids. You can get a fantastic view of Catalina Island on a clear day and looking down on the cliffs and ocean is always pleasing. This is a very relaxing place to spend some quiet time and take some photos. There is a small cafe across the parking lot if you need, an outdoor stage, picnic tables in front of the stage.We always enjoy coming to Point Fermin Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
40,Wonderful park with a beautiful view.,"Late Sunday afternoon we stopped here to see the lighthouse. There was a festival going on with live music on the public stage. We walked through the park with its beautiful shade trees enjoying the music. While the park has many amenities, its greatest is the incredible view of the ocean all the way to Catalina Island. As a bonus the weekend brought out several boats, including one that was far to close to the rocks and could not start its engine. It was about to crash into the rocks of sunken city. Firefighters were on the way to assist when we left. Despite the drama, or perhaps because of it, this was a great park especially for a late weekend visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
30,Nice park,We went here for a wedding. It was a nice setting; there were a few homeless people in the area panhandling. The park has really neat old trees. There are restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshevilleGypsy
40,Brought Back Memories!,I spent a lot of time exploring Point Fermin Park as I growing up and I was so happy to find that it hasn't changed a great deal. The park still has the most amazing trees whose shapes defy explanation. The views of the ocean are unobstructed and change with the weather. I love that you can still hear the waves crashing on the beach below. All good memories that I could relive now! It is a beautiful place to spend some time enjoying nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrebs
40,Nice Park,"This is a nice little park and a great place to start a run from. It is one of the greener places in the area and I find it to be a nice, peaceful place to take our dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KBacklund10
40,Historic Lighthouse and Park with Views,We enjoyed our visit to Point Fermin Park. The views of the Pacific Ocean are so nice. There is a historic lighthouse. It was built in 1874 and was the first navigational light house into the San Pedro Bay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,Beautiful area next to a bustling port,"Getting here required driving through some really shady looking neighborhoods. But the park itself is pretty attractive, with the cliffside, rocky beach, and the still-green grassy park. Lots of photographic opportunities. The lighthouse itself is pretty dinky. It's location right on the point is what makes it photogenic.I'd suggest coming here in the afternoon, when the sun is hitting the lighthouse from the north/west. You can get a good photo of it from the north end of the park.There's a steep path that goes down to the beach, also from the north end of the manicured park. Street/lot parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0garibaldi0
30,OK place for a short walk,"Not much to do there. Nice views, though. Fairly decent amount of parking. Probably nice place to walk your dog (I don't have a dog, though).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadRusski
50,"The views and atmosphere, just fantastic.","Everything about this place is electric, and I can't wait to get back for a visit every time i leave. This is by far one of my top ten places in the world. In a city full of crazies, people in a hurry, and those whom just don't appreciate what they have, this place makes you forget about ALL of that. Stay a while, walk around and see all there is to be seen, you'll feel the same way I do about this park which holds a special place in my heart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5823GDianm
50,Ocean View For Your Picnic,"This park is so beautiful. They have covered picnic tables right on the edge of the cliff overlooking the ocean. The park also houses the historic Point Fermin Lighthouse. They give free tours of the lighthouse all the way up to the top where the light use to shine in the night sky every couple of house a day.The park has huge beautiful trees, and outside stage and a playground for the kiddies. We recently went there for a picnic potluck for my fiance bday and we had a great time eating talking and listening to the waves crash onto the rocks below. Its also nice for a run or jog around the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niketac2013
50,beautiful spot,"This is a very pretty park with covered protected picnic tables on the edge of the cliff overlooking Catalina Island and the mouth of the Port of San Pedro. Good place for watching boat traffic, or enjoying the sea breeze. The light pretty Victorian light house was not open when we were there but looked interesting. There is a nice playground and a small bandstand. LOTS of big wide old trees too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyD832
50,What a gem of a park hidden away with the best views.. Enjoy the sunsets with someone special,Came upon this lovely park by accident while exploring San Pedro after spending a day on the USS Iowa. What a treat it was. Amazing views of the ocean sets an amazing backdrop for a relaxing lunch or flying kites or even celebrating a birthday party for the kids. A beautiful lighthouse with a lovely garden all around sits in the middle of the park. It was great hearing about all the history of this place and very friendly staff. Very romantic for a walk with your lovely through the park and the ocean cliffs. Sit on a bench outside and relax in the ocean breeze. All in all this park has it all. Parking is free so come out and enjoy a perfect day in the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsK1099DH
50,A jewel by the L.A port,"Wonderful place to stay an afternoon. As we just finished the cruise and were waiting for our flight in the evening, we decided to go there on a whim. It was very beautiful and warm place at this time of the year, more over the water was very warm and we even saw dolphins nearby. There is a lot of opportunity to picnic and to do water activity. I would recommend it for anyone to spent time with their family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuimAudio
50,Beautiful ocean view,We had a wonderful picnic by the walls that overlook the beautiful ocean. The grounds are old but well kept up. There is an Old lighthouse there also that you can visit and view all the rooms. The weather was great for a days outing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gccamp
40,Very good!,"This is a gorgeous little park but not one that I would take my little one to on my own. There are a lot of creepy people wandering around there that didn't make it feel as safe as I would have liked. Other than that, my son's cub scout pack did their bridging ceremony there one evening and it was absolutely the most gorgeous backdrop! Everyone raved over what a gorgeous venue it was to have the scouts bridge at the park. I would also visit there a lot to take sunset pictures and pictures of the flowers at the lighthouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjscollins
40,Dont miss the Sunken City!!,"The 600 block of San Pedro fell into the ocean. Now its called the Sunken City, cool graffiti, awesome view. If you are staring at the Point Fermin Lighthouse go all the way to your left, there is a fence there with a hole at the bottom that anybody, any size can fit thru, there is also a hole in the fence at the end of the fence line toward the ocean you can use. There are signs that say no trespassing but its more of an enter at your own risk, there were TONS of people there when we were there. Watch for gang-bangers, they didnt hassle us but it was a Sunday afternoon...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Degram01
40,"Small, but perfectly formed.","Lovely little park that was mentioned in our guide book, and we thought we'd stop in since it was very close to Long Beach, which I also heartily recommend. It's hard to sum up how nice the place is, it's idyllic. Parking is fine and free, there's a lighthouse that you can go in, but the main attraction is the beautiful grass, palm trees, and stunning views out into the ocean at the passing ships and mist. It's really a top view, and nice and quiet too. You might only be there for 20 minutes, but it's free and very pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jk80
50,"Peaceful, beautiful view of the ocean, cliff and racoons.","Got to spend some time there, just enjoying the view and peacefulness of the area. Great for picnic, don't forget your camera. We go there every year with my little family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiroaFanaua
