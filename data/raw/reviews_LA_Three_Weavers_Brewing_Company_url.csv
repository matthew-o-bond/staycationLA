30,Interesting Beers,"Three Weavers makes a wide selection of beers. The day we visited we tried their sampler, and while some were good, none knocked our socks off. They are located in an industrial park, so there is little reason to enjoy the scenery while having a beer or two.",Max G

50,Great Craft Beers on Tap or Bottled for Take Out at the Brewery; funded by Kickstarter,We were staying at a motel down the street and wanted a beer to go with the pizza we were taking out from next door. They have tables for those wanting to drink there and a few of their beers in bottles for take out. I told them what was looking for in a beer and was given a sample. It was just right and available in bottles. I told them I didn't have a bottle opener so they sold me a souvenir one for $2. They couldn't open them for me as you can't take open bottles from the brewery.,Lee F
