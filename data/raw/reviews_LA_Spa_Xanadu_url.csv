50,Wonderful relaxing spa full of wonderful employees!,"Wonderful relaxing spa full of wonderful employees. My business meetings brought me to this area monthly from July to November. I brought my daughter with me in July and that began my monthly trek to this wonderful spa. Everyone from the front desk receptionist to the license practitioners were amazing. First month my daughter and I spoiled ourselves with some massages and body scrubs all around. Every month since then I have returned to spend my first afternoon being spoiled by the wonderful ladies there. Facility is clean and relaxing and truly an escape from the world. The body scrubs are amazing, and the massage is relaxing and the facials rejuvenating. And yes I have tried all different combinations :-) After my first visit even be adorable front desk receptionist remember me by name and welcomed me warmly. I can't say enough about this wonderful small business and the workers in it! I will truly miss my monthly visits and relaxation! If I am back in this area I will absolutely stop in for treatments!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Da2011
