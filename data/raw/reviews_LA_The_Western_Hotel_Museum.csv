40,"Charming, Creaky Old Building with Artifacts","If you like small museums, old buildings and human-scale historical collections, this place is for you. We'd been meaning to go here for like 12 years, and finally found a weekend when it was open. (As the other reviews say, check their website for hours of operation.) We liked the echoey, empty-ish rooms and hallways with a modest number of artifacts, photos, maps, household items and odds and ends. Like most 19th century buildings this has a whiff of haunting, counterbalanced with a pleasant, homey vibe. I liked how the staff showed us the old, old bare footprint of Judy Garland's in the cement under the arbor out back, and were generally just very helpful and nice about making us feel welcome. Before or after you visit, be sure to visit the museum of art and history just a block or so west on the same side of the street -- they have excellent exhibits and offer a rich, modern counterpoint to the old stuff on display in the Western Hotel. Actually if you don't live in the area, consider taking Metrolink (on a Saturday when the Hotel is open, and a day pass is only $10.) You can easily walk the couple of blocks from the station to the museums, and save the drive from LA. Just don't do it on a scorching day, obviously. Plenty of little restaurants to get a cool drink, coffee or lunch right in the same neighborhood, ""The Blvd."" which has been gussied up for the cultural / dining / entertainment going on here now. Lots of free parking right on the street and free public lots around the corner.",SoCalRambler

40,"Fun History Visit to The Western Hotel Museum, Lancaster",We visited the Western Hotel Museum which is in the Blvd area of Lancaster. Its the oldest building in the area built in 1888 and had several names. The most famous owners where George and Myrtie Webber. Myrtie lived to be 110.The museum today has art and historical displays which were fun to see.,mini
50,Wonderful little historical spot,Great place to take the kids for a little local history lesson. This historic hotel is one of the oldest standing structures in the Antelope Valley. Built around 1888 it still possesses the feel of the 1800's with artifacts and historical photos of the area. Check the open days as its only open 4 days a month. It's very cool.,ACprojects
30,Part of the Boulevard Experience,"For tourists, it can be part of a one to two day Boulevard experience for the entire family. From the Western Hotel to the Art Museum, its a great way to spend an afternoon walk and window shopping experience. The museum is small and quaint but rich in history. Maybe not for everyone, but worth admission if you are in the area.",RLDrPH
30,A fun trip to the past,"A fun look back at the past, look for Frances Ethel Gumm, later known as Judy Garland's footprints in the pavement behind the hotel. Much of her early stage work took place in Lancaster.",JohhHoward
30,Nice place……. hours open are not sufficient!,"Don't go on a Thursday. The hours of operation are not sufficient, in my opinion. We wanted to go and see this historical museum, but were disappointed to find it was closed most days and that the hours are very limited. Perhaps the Chamber of Commerce could find a way to support this facility as it would definitely draw travelers in for a look. We gazed at it from the sidewalk and it is a nicely restored building. Wish we could have experienced more!",Retsof1949
30,Worth the stop if nearby,"We enjoyed our visit to this property. It did not consume much time and much of it was closed off. Donations are at your choice, and worth a couple of bucks. Parking is free and was available on this weekend day. Hours/days available Limited. Not chock full of items, but it does represent some of the town history.",ranles76
40,"Insight Into ""The Good Old Days""","Take your kids here to show them how much our expectations have changed in 100 years! The hotel's rooms are tiny, which is to be expected. (A bedroom was just that--a bed in a room, which you used to sleep. You went to the lobby if you wanted to read, write a letter, or play cards.)But what interested me during my visit was how short the beds are. You'd assume it was because people then weren't generally as tall as they are today. But no--the tour guide said it was because people didn't really sleep in a prone position then; they sat up more in bed, propped up by pillows. Very interesting!",Gail1Marie
50,Experience Pioneer Lancaster,The Western Hotel gives people the opportunity to see what Lancaster was like during the days of the Wild West. It is a beautifully restored Victorian treasure in the heart of the newly renovated downtown. A trip to Lancaster would not be complete without scheduling in a visit here as well.,christian f
