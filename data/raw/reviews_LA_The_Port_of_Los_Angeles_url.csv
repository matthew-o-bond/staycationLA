50,Vast and bustling,"One of the largest ports in the country, it was great to see the vastness that it incorporates.With 27 cargo terminals it uses nearly 90 container cranes to rapidly move the mammoth trade passing through.Its importance is reflected in the fact that about one-fifth of all cargo into the US arrives here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia

If you want to view cruise ships and see how huge they have become, check their schedules, and come to the Port of Los Angeles!If you enjoy battleships come down and visit the USS Iowa. It is truly spectacular and is an example of naval history. Great to tour and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,NCL Star Cruise Embarkation Process,"We arrived at the Port of Los Angeles on 04 Jan 2019 for a cruise on the NCL Star at 11:40 AM. The baggage collection process started at curb side where porters took your bags if they were properly tagged with NCL baggaage tags. We expected to tip the porters so we were not put off by them as they have one heck of a mess on their hands to get all bags towards the ship with a steady flow of 2400 passengers coming their way. We had to show our NCL Cruise Documents to enter the building where we took and escalator up to the Check In Desk area. Very, very organized process with plenty of NCL staff to handle arriving guests. The Security Check occured after you had finished checking in for the cruise. There was plenty of room to accommodate this process as compared to other ports we had embarked from in the past. After Security, we walked towards the ramp that took us to the NCL Star. This was our sixth cruise and by far was the smoothest embarkation process of all of them. We walked onto the Star at 12:10 PM. Everyone involved are thanked for this smooth effort which started our cruise. Well done!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoKan51
50,Not the easiest to find,We took a local limo service from Disney to the port and even he got lost. We did make it on time since I built in freeway traffic. Once we got to the port it was smooth sailing to unload luggage and check in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6571ETmichelep
10,Getting on the cruise ship,"We were at this port for our cruise. The porters are shameless in asking for tips for bringing your luggage to the ship (even just across the street to the luggage loading area). Even if you bring your luggage right to the door of the loading area, they still request a tip to bring it inside. And if you do not give them what they consider a large enough tip, they will stand in your way and refuse to let you pass. (And make you feel like your luggage may not make it onto the ship if you don't pay them more)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viv2367b
50,Boating in The Los Angeles Harbor,"We decided to try fishing in the Los Angeles Harbor, a part of the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro. The fishing was good, but boating in the harbor area was eye opening. We launched our boat at the Cabrillo Beach. The harbor was a huge complex with many channels and shipping lanes. It will take several hours to explore the whole area. One main attraction is the Thomas Vincent Bridge. Cruising underneath the bridge with traffic on top is a rare treat. We were surprised with water clarity, with visibility of probably 10 to 12 feet. There are many huge cargo ships that were loaded with containers from many countries. Most of the harbor have deep water. For fishing, you need to go to the back channels and find more shallow water. But, you need to be aware of the ""Controlled Navigational Area"". These areas are not allow to be entered. We will definitely come back to try again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francisp404
