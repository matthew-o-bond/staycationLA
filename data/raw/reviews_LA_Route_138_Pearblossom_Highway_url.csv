40,Shortcut between Magic Mountain and Victorville!,"Shortcut between Magic Mountain and Victorville! Each time I drive it, it becomes less backwoods and rustic.

My wife was gripping my arm the entire drive. Luckily we did not have to travel during snow or rain. Would be an absolute nightmare and accident zone!,Jason S
20,Poor signage near Wrightwood,"The signage on 138 heading east near Wrightwood (coming from Palmdale) is lacking and misleading. A sign on 138 heading east says 5 miles to Wrightwood. Then there is no sign until Hwy 2 and it just says Hwy 2 (at the highway), which is where u have to turn to get to Wrightwood in 5 miles (20 min. delay for me). There is a needed warning sign that says Hwy 2 is imminent (say 100 yards) and a missing turn right for Wrightwood sign! There are signs coming the other way - from San Bernardino.Also there was construction (inactive on Sunday) and mis-timed lights in Palmdale that caused very excessive delays with east/wwest 138 traffic - waiting 5 minutes for no one except for the light to change at 47th street east and 37th street east - shame on CA gov!",Dave K.

Today we had a tri tipsandwich special with crispy fries and onion rings. Grilled onions, tri tip and Swiss cheese on a garlic butter sandwich roll.

40,What Was,"What was once the deadliest stretch of highway in California for sure if not the whole country. Is now it would appear all about done with its makeover.Gone is the clutching of the wheel and hoping the crosswind in one of those S-turns isn't enough to slam you face first into the incoming tractor/trailer. Now the only danger is the law with a fat ticket or the occasional moron that either sight-sees at 30mph or has to get past you sooooo bad even when you're clipping at 70.....in a 55.It's a safe nostalgic cruise through the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains in the high dessert side. Little hills so abrupt that one feels like they're flying through the air. Depending in what you drive the flying could be real.Catch it from the 15 in the early morning, it'll take a couple of hours to the 5 at the top of the grapevine, or late afternoon west to east. This way the sun isn't in your face. A short part through Palmdale and Lancaster is freeway, but the rest is all drive.Don't know about you, but I can't drive 55",gabor4u@hotmail.com

They re-seed and occur naturally every year. If you get stuck behind a big truck, it will be a slow trip, as it's two lanes and lots of no passing areas. There is a speed limit of 55 but as far as I can tell, no one does it.. Its the best way to get to I-5 north from Lancaster or Palmdale",k9julie

Other than that, passing on this road is quite dangerous. It is fairly straight but there are ups and down, small hills that hide oncoming cars very well.

In the interim period caution is advised with great attention to oncoming traffic. I still see many drivers passing cars &trucks over double yellow linrs.

20,Few Alternatives,"There's a reason that this highway is repeatedly named one of the deadliest highways in America. It is a heavily traveled two lane highway with a lot of semi traffic. Drivers get impatient and try to pass causing many head on collisions. Several attempts to curb the fatalities have not helped, a slower speed zone and lane dividers have failed as well.

20,This really is no attraction...,"This is the highway from Palmdale to HWY 15 N at Victorville. HWY 138 is notorius for the number of fatal collisions along its path. It is a very bad choice to drive at dusk or dawn and to be avoided at night if possible.What makes it bad are the numbers of idiots that drive it. Even though all cars are encouraged to drive with headlights on at all times, there are ""those people"" who can't be bothered and just put their parking lights on at dusk.Those same people can't be bothered with no passing areas because they have a pickup with a huge engine that entitles them to 'chance it"".For those law abiding drivers there is also the boredom factor that causes drowsiness and leads to head on collisions.Now I'm not saying that I haven't driven this HWY 138 before because I have - both day and night and am still here. There are daily drivers that commute this way every day and never have had a problem. It's just that so many started a trip only to find that it was their last.",Robert C

40,A better alternate for those traveling from SFV to Vegas,"State Highway 138 (Pearblossom Highway) is an undivided highway that parallels the northern flank of the San Gabriel Mountains between Palmdale and Victorville. For those who live in the San Fernando Valley, (or even Glendale/Burbank), it is a ""better"" route to take when headed to Interstate 15 for Las Vegas and points north.As previous reviewers mentioned, recent construction has widened portions of the highway from a two-lane road to a four-lane road. But, not the whole stretch. It could be frustrating at time if caught behind a semi tractor trailer.The tarmac is good and for those who wish to travel the road via bicycle, the shoulder is plenty wide for safe riding. Just be sure to bring ear plugs to filter out the road noise. However, other routes are probably better for bicycles, such as Fort Tejon Road, which has much less vehicular traffic, and no trucks.Traversing from west to east, after leaving Palmdale, there are only two small towns until you reach Victorville. The first, only a few miles outside Palmdale is Littlerock. This community has a reduced speed limit, and the road narrows to only one lane in each direction. Be sure to observe the posted speed limit, as this stretch is heavily patrolled by the California Highway Patrol. There are several fast-foot restaurants and a nice fruit market. Gasoline is more expensive than Palmdale, so if you are running low, it is best to fill up before leaving the larger city with more retail competition.The next town you will arrive at will be Pearblossom. This town is much smaller than Littlerock and the speed limit is not reduced, (or if it is, only slightly). About the only things of interest in Pearblossom is the post office, a gas station, and the turnoff to Devil's Punchbowl, (a county park/recreation area which is well worth visiting, if it isn't too hot).Past Pearblossom, the highway continues as a two-lane and four-lane highway until the turnoff to either Victorville to the east, or Phelan/Wrightwood/Interstate 15 going south.Another alternate to the I-15 for San Fernando Valley is instead of getting off the 14 Freeway at Pearblossom Highway is to continue on the 14 through Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosemond to the community of Mojave. At that point, take state highway 58 east to Barstow to pick up the Interstate 15 freeway. The reason if that the 15 can get awfully crowded with stop-and-go traffic between Victorville and Barstow. Even though this route is a little bit longer, it has a whole lot less traffic and rarely will you traverse at speeds less that the maximum posted speed limit. A side benefit is that you can top off your gas tank at the Costco in Lancaster before hitting the open desert.",volosong

40,A hidden Gem,"This is a rural area in the fast paced SoCal. It is also a shortcut to Las Vegas, mostly traffic free. You can also access Big Bear from Pearblossom. Be sure to give yourself a few hours to stop at the Charlie Brown Farms. What is offers is everything! All kinds of gift shop tourist shop items, food of all kinds, fresh and packaged. For example nuts, coffee, local honey, 100's of different candies, a grill serving buffalo burgers and date shakes. Plus a winery tasting room, and that's all in the primary room. But there are 8 rooms! Explore the extensive doll collection, the ceramic close outs, the Elivis collection, the fairy collection, incense, biker gear, stationary, the list is exhaustive. A one of a kind experience. If you prefer outdoor experiences, turn off Pearblossom for a trip to the unexpected Devil's Punch Bowl, a mini grand canyon in SoCal.",Aaliyah Y

40,Death HWY! Tourist attraction,Try to avoid if it all possible - undivided HWY with lots of accidents. There are some nice places to stop by: Charlie Brown and Hungarian Valley! Charlie Brown sells some local foods and souvenirs. Food they serve is not very good. Skip. Hungry!? Then go to Hungarian Valley! They serve excellent sandwiches. They sell all possible Eastern European meats and preserves. Prices are decent. I love this place.,ArtRussianMom

30,Only 2 Things to do?,"Actually Hwy 18 west from Victorville, CA merges with the Pearblossom Hwy, which is Hwy. 138. Then 138 goes through the Joshua Natl ""Forest."" It is really a desert. Then you go past, but do not pass the Valley Hungarian Sausage co and Charlie Brown's Fruit stand on its way into Palmdale. I count 3 Things to Do including the Hwy. :-)My sister lives there, in Palmdale. Family and Business are the 2 reasons to visit Palmdale.",Eddie L
