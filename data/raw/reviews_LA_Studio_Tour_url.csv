40,Visit,This is a fun drive around Universal Studio. I didn't really care for the 3D experience but everything thing else is a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missedme
50,A one of a kind experience packed with lots of movie history,"The Studio Tour is a definite must ride when you're at Universal Studios...You ride in a tram on the Studio Tour so we usually plan this towards the end of our day when we need a break from running around all day. You have a tram guide who guides you through all the sets and attractions for a personal touch. They also play videos on the tram monitor of directors and actors who talk about making films as well as movie scenes from the sets you'll visit on the tram.Movie sets included: Back to the Future Hill Valley Clock Tower, Streets of NYC, Psycho House and Bates motel, Grinch Set, Crashed 747 set from War of the Worlds (my favorite), Wisteria Lane Desperate housewives.The interactive outdoor movie sets were Jaws and the Mexican Village Flash Flood. The artificial rain and flash flood is pretty cool to see happen right before your eyes.Movie props you'll see: Famous movie cars and lots of vehicles and equipment used in Jurassic Park.The enclosed movie set experiences were King Kong, San Francisco Earthquake and the Fast and the Furious Experience. King Kong and the Fast and the Furious are in 3D and they turn the tram into a motion sensor ride. Great stuff.When you see all the sets, it's much smaller and dazzling in person which makes me appreciate the film makers skillset much more. You'll recognize a lot of the sets from movies you've seen through the years which I always found fascinating. I would suggest sitting in the middle tram cars if possible because you get the best experience there imo. Good luck and enjoy! =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninong247
50,Amazing!,I absolutely loved the backlot tour! It was a thrill ride! You definitely need to do this when you visit Universal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler902109
50,55 Year Anniversary of Back Lot Tour,"This tour is the hi-light of Universal. Over the years they have added a few ""experiences"" along the way usually using special effects and computer imagery. Sit for an hour on a tram and enjoy! There are plenty of things to photograph so have your camera ready!! What is really cool is I was here in 1972 and so much is the same! The more things change, the more they stay the same:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peterpan4ever
50,Simply brilliant!,What a great way to learn and experience how films are made and where they are made! Long queues but they soon go down and takes about 1 hour in total to do the experience! I would highly recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duerds5
50,An experience!,The studio tour was pretty fascinating. Enjoyed seeing the film sets and the indoor scenes with the 3D glasses! Pretty amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshadrosky
40,something new on each visit,"The line up is always moving, and our wait was maybe 20 minutes in the mid-afternoon. We go every few years and the Studio Tour changes a couple of things every now and then. New since we were last here: the Fast and Furious and Jurassic World areas of the tour.Live set: although he was a block away, our tram stopped while Blake Shelton performed for a small group of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iceman68
50,A look around,The studio tour is part of universal studios and it takes about 45min you go around the film sets and back lots they have there an in depth look into how films are made well worth a look .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404christiner404
50,Recommended,"Can't really do Universal without the studio tour, specially if you are a movie buff like me. A guided tour that will definetly stay with me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriqueg974
50,VIP Tour,"Firstly, TripAdviser can‚Äôt seem to find any other VIP Tour comments, which I find very hard to believe...Trip Adviser?We started well before the park opened, vip entry to our private breakfast area, where we enjoyed a lovely breakfast and our guide walked the room and introduced themselves to our couples. At our tour time we stepped into the park, being watched by everyone still awaiting entry....feels good lol !Our tour started at 9am, running till around 4pm, with super front line access to all the attractions, guided small bus tour of the full area, including vip only access to areas the normal tours don‚Äôt get to and stop and stay access to areas the normal tours drive past...photo op heaven !Lunch is fantastic. Make sure you sit on the veranda and enjoy the view, whilst you also enjoy the fine dining food. You may also find a few guests turn up...we had a fantastic Count Dracula to welcome us followed by Lucile Ball, who was brilliant.Our guide Danielle 9am Thursday 2nd May 2019 was perfect. Nothing fazed her, live filming issues were overcome and we were kept entertained by her knowledge and humour.This is not a cheap Tour, however bearing in mind what you get, it‚Äôs good value for money. VIP Access all areas baby üëç",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougskisunpeaks
40,Back Lot Fun,"The Back Lot Tour is really fun and you get to sit down for an hour as well! The trams takes you all around the lot, including the psycho house, Jaws lagoon, old west towns, Desperate Housewives lane including the Munster's house. Sound stages, old Hollywood star bungalows, Mexican town with a flood (which was a blast), and two 3D shows while on the tram.One being King Kong 3D which is a big fight between King Kong and dinosaurs. The tram bucks around, splashes of water while the monsters fight with each other. It's really fun and everybody was shrieking!The next 3D entertainment is the Fast and Furious with cars zooming around, the Fast and Furious folks driving like the wind after the bad guy who wants to ""eliminate"" one of us on the tram. A lot of fun and action. I like Vin Diesel and The Rock so it was fun to see them again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865kg
50,Behind the scenes... Excellent!,"I consider this to be one of the best things at The Universal Studios. When last here in 1990 I think a smaller version of it was called a 'Backlot Tour'. Like everything at Universal Studios you have to wait in the queue anything from 40 to well over 60 minutes to board the trams, however they do take a large number of people to the backlot of Universal Studios where many movies and television shows have been filmed. You pass sound stages, street facades such as New York, Mexico and a wild West town, Bates Motel from 'Psycho', go through both an earthquake and a flood plus much more. The whole tour took just under an hour. I would suggest that you do this tour as soon as you arrive then go to other exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betula103
40,Universal studio tram tour,"This informative tour is one part history and another part thrill ride experience..... the tram takes you past sound stages that were used for well known TV shows in the past and are still being used today. You travel along streets with buildings that were used and still are being used for movies and TV, such as the front steps of the courthouse building that was used in To Kill A Mockingbird is also the clock tower building that was used in Back to the Future.... or Wisteria Lane, scene of the TV series Desperate Housewives.The original Bates Motel from the Alfred Hitchcock classic movie Psycho still stands with the Bates house just up the hill where Norman Bates‚Äô mother still sits in her room on the second floor, watching....You travel past vehicles that were used in classic movie series and TV series... Jurassic Park, the Fast and the Furious, Back to the Future, Knight Rider....You move past sets of the old West, the streets New York, a Mexican village, a fishing port... you experience a flood, an earthquake and a shark attack.Your 3D experience takes you into a jungle where King Kong protects you when dinosaurs attack and later into the middle of a Fast and Furious chase scene... all this in less than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj
30,Not a big fan of blockbusters,"I'm not a big fan of blockbuster movies, so a lot of the references on the tour were lost on me. It's tram tour of the back lot. It's interesting, but I prefer the Paramount Tour where they talk more about the movie business, how the studio started, etc. Our tour giude spieled off movie and t.v. show names, most of which I hadn't seen. However, if you like the special effects, this is the tour for you. The King Kong portion is pretty spectacular. (Had an issue and didn't get the full effect of fast & furious.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krae21
40,jaws and more,"Loved it. we rode around on the bus and had special effects as we got flooded in a tube station and took part in a fast and furious movie. Lots of interesting stuff to see on the back lots. Houses, cars, set from Jaws - watch out for shark. Great to see how they make the magic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017
40,It used to be better!,"My last time before 2018 was in the year 2009 - I think it was more unique back then. Nowadays its mostly 4D video's and example Bates Motel does not have real human actors anymore.Yes, it's a good attraction still, but I would love to see more human interaction on tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
50,Pull Back the Curtain on Hollywood,"What a great way to see a history of famous movies from Universal, as well as how they shoot certain scenes and special effects. The day we went on a tour, they were shooting different things, so we weren't able to see it all, but we still had fun!There are several parts of this ride where you will get wet and there is 3D special effects going on as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveDuff
50,Great to see some of the time and effort for movie production,"I really enjoyed this tour. We got to go on a tour of the backlots see some very famous old sites preserved and 2 4d motion rides thrown in for good measure. Got to see a little of Amity Island from Jaws, Whoville, Bates motel, the Plane crash from war of the worlds, The King Kong and Fast and Furious 4d rides were fantastic. I loved the Jurassic Park section. A few Production vehicles are on display for you to see also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
50,"Different Options for ""Behind the Scenes""","I have taken both of these tours, and each has their pros and cons depending on what it is you like from these kind of the things.The cheaper tour, you are on a larger TRAM kind of transport and roll through the majority of the backlot. You will not get to stop and get off where you can walk on the sets, production or props area, and get a few nuggets of narration that might be of interest to someone into the whole Hollywood 'magic'. You do not get any kind of fast pass to get into the front of the lines, it's just the tour more or less.On the VIP tour, it costs almost 3 times as much, but you will get a longer guided tour in a smaller group on a trolly. You will get a fast pass where you get unlimited rides all day and can cut to the front of the line for all rides. There are a few more stops where you get off and walk on the movie sets. Lunch in a private restaurant for only VIP members with a gourmet buffet style set up. The food is delicious, and has a nice view for you to enjoy while eating. A few characters will stop by while you dine for selfie and such.Obviously if you have a family, the latter can be pretty expensive. If you are a couple, it is still pricey, but it has it's pros and cons depending on what you would like to get out of your amusement park/movie studio experience. I have done both. I liked the latter, but I do not know that I would do it again in the near future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,Original and Unique,"The Universal Studios Tour is the original Hollywood Backlot Tour that takes you to the backlot of Universal Studios where many movies and t.v. shows have been filmed. Let's get to it....WAIT TIME...The wait time for this attraction is typically 45 minutes to an hour or more depending on crowds/season. However, it does seem to go by fast as the trams do take a huge amount of people per loading. So you wait, but it goes by quickly. As well, you can buy refreshments just before getting in line and the best part is you can take those refreshments aboard the tram. If you purchase any of the VIP or Front of the line passes, your time is significantly cut and are loaded in as quickly as 10 to 15 minutes.TRAM...The tram itself is okay as far as comfort. It's not bench seating, rather seats on a bench which could make things extra tight. Basically it's not designed like the Disneyland tram, it's more like bus seats.ATTRACTION...So the main basis of this tour is to TOUR the backlot of Universal Studios which has a lot of history. You will pass by old west sets, New York, sometimes depending on filming, town square where Back to the Future was filmed but since filming and since the latest backlot fire, has been rebuilt and redesigned and really looks nothing like it did for the 1985 movie. Along the tour you will also see the set from War of the Worlds which is really awesome and again, depending on filming schedules, the street set of Wysteria Lane. As you see these sets, you will be amazed as to what they look like in person comapred to seeing them on tv!Earthquake is really now an oldie but a goodie, it first appeared in 1988, and has since been producing earthquakes for the tram tour. Another regular on the tour is the flooding mexican village. That one is always fun to see...and you may get wet. Jaws makes his appearance on schedule and smiles for photo ops!For those of you that remember....the tram no longer passes through the crumbling bridge or the spinning tunnel (see below). Not to sure about the parting sea....New additions include the King Kong 360 and Fast and Furious. King Kong 360 was a replacement for the original King Kong which burned to the ground a few years ago. It's a pretty nifty attraction, of course all 3D or 4D whatever they call it. Fast and Furious replaces two former backlot scenes, the Dancing Cars and the Spinning Tunnel. This is also a 3D or 4D attraction but it's not the greatest part of the tour. It's not exciting, it's just okay. To me, just an added element to the tour. In between all that, you will see some unique things like the production cars, jurassic park vehicles, Whoville, Psycho, production houses, and the exterior of sound stages. I have yet to see a celebrity crossing paths but it is possible.Overall, it is part of Universal Studios and staple of the theme park. You can't go to Universal Studios and not do the tour. While the routes are pretty much the same, no tour is the same. Your guides offer different insights to each part of the backlot. The tour is approximately 45 mins to an hour long. Depending on filming schedules, it may be longer due to the ""quiet on the set"" restrictions. Yes, they still run tours even as they film.In the end, it really is a must do at Universal Studios. PLENTY of photo opportunities...and you may recognize a set or two from your favorite movie or t.v. show.If you purchase the VIP Experience, you are taken on a different type of tram and you are able to get off and explore. Obviously, that experience is pretty hefty, but it is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcfam79
50,I cannot believe no one has reviewed this!,"The Studio Tour is iconic! It involves History, modern Tech, amazing fun, excitement and scary stuff. Little kids may not like it. If you are partial to motion sickness be a tad wary. I get motion sick, and it can give me a spin or two but SOOOO woryh it!DO YOUR HOMEWORK! UNIVERSAL SHOULD BE HISTORICAL MONUMENT!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB336
