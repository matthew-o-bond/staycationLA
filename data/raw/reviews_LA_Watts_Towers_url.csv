10,Almost nothing to see.,"Perhaps my favorite cultural icon of my hometown, Los Angeles. Unfortunately it is now shrouded in the ugliest scaffolding I’ve ever seen. I am totally supportive of restoration, but there had to be a better way to do the work.Worst of all it’s going to look like this for three years!The towers were created by a genius, Simon Rodia, working alone for something like 33 years. Many people believe they are the largest artwork ever created by one person.I’m sure they will return beautifully when the work is over, but for now I’ve just got my memories and a lot of photos.Interesting timing with 2/3 of the LA County art museum being demolished, and the abrupt closing of the Marciano Art Foundation a few months ago.",Okyay
50,I STRONGLY SUGGEST A VISIT!! A WORLD REKNOWN WORK OF BEAUTY,"I saw these Towers being Honored and Respected Shrine to the United States of AMERICA, I am very proud of my childhood and the people surrounding this work that shows Love of new found country. Totally loved by his neighbors.",darrellcoburn
40,Interesting Sight,Worth checking out during the day. Roland who works at the Arts Centre was very friendly and knowledgeable. He’s been in the neighborhood for over 30 years. Great guy. Unfortunately the towers were being restored at the time we were visiting but it was amazing to see the scale of the towers and how one person built them over a 30 year period.,Ken
50,Extraordinary life’s work,"We knew that the main towers were under conservation so weren’t disappointed to find them sheathed. But there was more than enough of the unique creation on display to marvel at.In 1921 at the age of 42 after some life's crises he began this unique undertaking, dedicating the next 33 years to it.Using salvaged materials and items, included much coloured glass, slowly it arose skywards. He walked many miles to gather artefacts and materials that ended up in his creation.",permia
40,Very cool,"These ""found objects"" art installation is old and historic. Be sure to check the open hours. It has an interesting story, and a look that was way before its time.",cookpias
50,Interesting spot for locals,Finally visited the place. The towers represent a bright spot Los Angeles' history. I recommend arriving early in the day - Monday - Friday.,SMOgal
40,Worth seeing,This is really worth a stop in Los Angeles. We were lucky enough to get a very gregarious guide. He gave us lots of history about Simon and his work of art. Really worth a side trip.,IMIUBU2
40,The City of Angels,"I’ve always wanted to visit the Watts Towers. It is such an awesome piece of LA history, but unfortunately, it is under renovation and surrounded by chain link fencing. You can see the towers through the fencing. However, it would have been nice to walk the grounds. Maybe I can do that the next time I am in town?",MrWarrenM
30,Worth a stop if you are in the area,"You have to drive through some bad neighborhoodsto get to this attraction.The towers are being renovated and thearea is surrounded by a fence.On the day we visited the museum buildingclosed at noon, this was on a Friday.There were informational signs posted on the fenceso the trip was not a total loss. Also, you cansee portions of the towers through the fence.",Emerald1125
10,Under reconstruction until the end of 2020,"At the moment, the towers are covered with plastic sheets and surrounded with a high fence. We came at noon and the museum was closed. The manager was inside, but she said she ""needs to eat"", so we should wait for an hour outside. We were allowed only to ""walk around the perimeter"" of the fence. If you come by metro, be very careful, because the walk to the towers is seven blocks in a seedy area with groups of hooded men in front of the liquor stores and on the streets. Until the end of 2020 there is nothing to you can see, so don't waste your time.",Mary
40,Really impressive L.A. landmark!,"Definitely not in a touristy area, Watts Towers is impressive in it's scope and achievement. The inspiration of one man over many years, the towers of metal have become an iconic attraction. But the neighborhood is not good, so don't go at night. Also lock your vehicle and hide valuables out of sight.",Jerry Crawford
40,"Not exactly in the safest part of the world, but during the day, nice.","This is in a very depressed area of Los Angeles and I would avoid this like the plague during evening or night. But in the light of day, it is safe enough and certainly one of the most unique cultural visitations you will find anywhere!",ashebroe
50,Watts Towers!,"I see that some of the reviews that weren't so good but it depends on what you are looking for and looking at. I looked at it as seeing a part of history in a traditionally bad part of L.A. I see it as a gem in the middle of nowhere. I heard about Watts and how bad it was for years, I also read about the Towers and saw them in a couple of movies so I wanted to see them up close myself.One of the other reviews was correct in that there arent many tourist out here but that's the reason to go and see it, its not a tourist spot per say but a historical piece of art in the middle of an area that has traditionally been called a ghetto.I felt safe and I walked around the towers and took photos, there was one other person out there doing the same thing. As with anywhere in an urban setting just act normal and be aware of your surroundings. Also it might not be wise to ride around Watts at night unless you know the area very well or live there. But then again, that goes for any urban area at night.",chiman45
40,Check it out,Just know it is located in a neighborhood that isn’t filled with tourists. It was great to see it in real life honestly. My daughter appreciated seeing this infamous structure.,Judelyn V
50,The Peoples' Art,Absolutely off the beaten path. This was put together by a local man and it was his lifetime work. He was an Italian immigrant and the tour opened my eyes to a history of LA that few talk about.,Marian G
20,Ugly sculptures in a really bad part of Los Angeles,Sorry but up close the sculptures are ugly and in a really bad unsafe neighborhood in Los Angeles. There is also no parking and you need to be standing in people's front yard to take a picture. There are drug addicts wandering around as well.I spent maybe 5 minutes here.,Ashley S
30,"Not the first choice, but an interesting place to see if you have enough time","First you have to know it is located not in the safest districts of LA, so be sure to keep an eye on the surroundings. Secondly, you will need approximately 30 minutes to look around and find out the craziness and talent behind the structure. And listen to the guide who would introduce to you Mr. Watt, his loneliness and longing to come back to his home in Italy. Thus the ship which would take him there..",786malgorzatac
50,Fascinating Minor Attraction,I really loved this wondrous sculptural arrangement and the creativity and sheer willpower involved in creating it. Make sure you visit when the tours are offered and make time to visit the nearby two buildings containing art exhibits in addition to the outdoor garden with the mosaics. A good way to learn about the history of the neighborhood as well.,Barzinji
40,A bit of history in the middle of the city,Showed up on a day it was closed. I never had seen the towers up close and in person. But being there you certainly could admire the efforts put into the towers. Around the property there is basically a self guided tour. It shares the story about how the towers came about. Walk a little farther and you will see on the ground a timeline of history with interesting facts about civil rights and other history.Definitely a place to go if you have interest in the history of Watts or Los Angeles. I want to go back when I can go inside and get the full experience of it all.,lowbuxlux
30,Visit Thursday-Sunday for the free guided tour outside the fence,"Be informed that Watts Tower is under restoration now (will be approximately until 2020, they say) so you can't get inside. Probably for that reason, there is no admission fee, but you can still see it from outside the fence and can also get a FREE guided tour Thurs. thru Sun. The free guided tours are held every half hour til 3pm. You can also take a look into the Art Center adjacent to it (which is open only Wed.thru Sun.), which is a mini art gallery, and inside they run a short film about Simon Rodia. He is the one who took 33 years to make the towers all by himself in his backyard! If you think of it that way, I thought it was an incredible work of art.Tips: If you are driving there, parking is available BEHIND the Art Center next to the Towers; so if you are driving off of 105 Freeway to Willowbrook Ave, turn right to the parking lot after passing 107th St.",Chia2005
50,The Watts Towers,"The Watts Towers were built by immigrant cement worker and tile setter Simon Rodia. The construction began in 1921 and continued for about 39 years. They are massive, skyward spiralling, tapering columns that basically consumed all of Rodia’s yard and literally towered over his home. They are considered an historic landmark of the city of LA and are a remarkable feat of “Outsider Art”. Rodia is quoted as saying, after immigrating to America but before starting his constructions, “‘I’m going to do something, I don’t know what it is. But it’s going to be big.” Turns out he was right. The “towers” are spectacular, planning permission controls must have been somewhat more “flexible” back in the day. The “Towers” are currently being “conserved”, that’s going to take about three years so on site tours are out for the moment, but info tours can be arranged through “The Watts Towers Arts Centre”. Or you can do a self guided tour, there are excellent info boards attached to the fence around the perimeter of the site.There’s a great backstory about how the “Towers” go to be a designated “historic park”, same as “Governors Island” in New York and it revolves around someone doing something about the then aboned and neglected structures.And Rodia’s creativity is clearly infectious, many of the houses opposite the site have their on special decoration.I travelled by train and got off at 103rd St / Watts Towers station. The “Towers” are easy to find, as you exit the station look back over your right should, if you can’t see the towers you will be able to see the nearby church (Santa Anna?), walk along the road that follows the train line, you’ll be there in no time. The studio garden which is part of the onsite “Arts Centre” is a bit of a treat. Watch out for the tortoises. And chickens, says something very positive about the local community.",Tony K
50,Who Knew?,Incredible monument to a man who ready wanted to do something great. Leave all your ghetto preconceptions behind. And this has nothing to do with the civil rights movement or Watts riot. I felt very safe. Just an amazingly piece of work by an immigrant laborer driven by a vision. Take the free tour around the perimeter while restoration/preservation in progress,Marc H
20,I was disappointed,I was looking forward to see the Watts Towers while was on a day trip to L.A. It was very hard to find due to a lots of detours in the neigbourhood. It was cordoned off and we weren't able to see it properly. It was deserted and located in a neigbourhood which made my son worry about safety so I could not explore it for long. It seemed smaller than I expected. Maybe if I had more time to look around...,eva
50,"Fabulous, looking forward to reopening","These historic towers are flanked by small houses which the art center has enhanced with owner permission , picaresque mosaics that are very nice. Presently one can only walk around the perimeter because there is a fence around it for conservation due to a rather dangerous deterioration. Go in the adjacent art center: really nice enthusiastic people and a gallery with art and a short fabulous, film of the man who built the towers.",lascola
50,Great example of what a determined person can do.,"Watts Towers was very interesting. However if you’re planning to go it is going to close soon for 3 years. You can look at the from beyond the gate I’m guessing, but not do the tour. The towers were the result of one man’s obsession. Simon Rodin was an Italian immigrant who wanted to build something big and he did. It was mistreated for some years buts it is now preserved and will be renovated as it is showing signs of wear and tear. There is a very interesting arts centre with a good exhibition space. Well worth the effort of going.",JennyLS48
50,Concrete and rebar,"Spawned in the burbs of Watts LA, a low income crime area, a creation of towers built by a man who had concrete and rebar for materials. This is an historical site and well worth the visit.",Raroboy
30,"Pretty Cool Structures in an Eerie, Sketchy Place","Some of the art work is nice and kind of reminds me of Gaudi with its folky eclecticism but don’t expect to see these structures off the freeway as they’re much smaller than you’d expect. Honestly I was also put off by the surrounding area as it felt desolate and too quiet for my comfort. Hardly any tourists or people in general to make the place more lively, it all felt like a sinister calm before a potential (though probably unlikely) storm given this neighborhood’s reputation. I don’t think I’d ever come back without a group of people with me, though I don’t really recommend it unless you’re just really curious to see what it looks like in person. For my part, I can at least say that I came, I saw it once, and then got the f out.",Colby S
50,"Tour, DVD viewing enrich the experience","The people who work onsite are helpful and dedicated. The actual artwork is inspiring and best seen on a tour. The DVD afterwards is not long, and it has some great images and music to accompany the soundtrack of people speaking. You can also look at some mosaics across the street and read signs on the outside gates. There are some turtles by a garden as well. Very enjoyable.",JJKFETP
50,Cultural Icon,"These rebar, concrete and tile towers were built over about a thirty year span from the 20's to the 50's. The creator then moved away and never came back. Go here, pay the $7 for the tour, it is worth it. Wander through the art gallery and talk to the people that work there. Many of the people working here came to the community center for art lessons as children and have a life-long commitment to this place. Martin was a fantastic person to talk to in the gallery, the gentleman and lady that we talked to in the office/reception area had some great stories and Eric was an outstanding tour guide. Be sure to check out the turtles in the garden as well.",craig c
50,A fascinating adventure in mosaic architecture,"Once before, I had driven to Watts Towers, but the gates were locked and the gallery was closed. This time, I got a guided tour of the towers with a lovely gentleman. A broadcast journalist, he had the most mesmerizing voice and was in command of the history of the towers and their architect.The towers are beautiful and the history makes them that much more interesting. For an Italian immigrant, Simon Rodia, to spend 33 years constructing the towers around his home outside of LA, it's all just amazing.I am so glad I got to see the towers up close and hear all about them. They're doing some constructive renovations in the coming year, so there may be some towers covered now and then. GO ANYWAY. The towers are dramatic, strong and beautiful.",evanscaribbean
40,Surprisingly Interesting,"I read about the Watts Towers before visiting LA. While the reviews were all over the board, it sounded worthwhile. During daylight hours the Watts area did not seem as scary as many make it sound. Actually, it was kind of interesting, especially if you're not used to passing through the seedier parts of a big City.I found the visit to the towers quite interesting. It's worth taking the guided tour so you understand how and why the artist built the towers. The description of the artist's heritage and travels to America were fascinating, as well as how he constructed the towers, where the materials came from, and how the towers survived after the artist's death despite the City's desire to tear it down.Check out the adjacent art center and gardens. The center employees are very knowledgeable about the artist and how the towers and center benefit the neighborhood.",archman8
20,Not really worth the time,The Watts Towers have long been talked about but I personally was not impressed. I could have used the time for something more interesting.,buffalojim67
30,Historic but Dangerous,"Watts Towers is one of those classic Los Angeles landmarks. It was created by the artistic vision and crafted by a single man Simon Rodia, several decades ago. Whereas many artistic creations, of this caliber, are lost to the hands of time, the city and the people of Los Angeles have caused this creation to remain.Now, there are a few things to keep in mind about Watts Towers before you make the trek to visit this location. First of all, it is fairly small. Many photographs lead one to believe that it is very enormous. Though it is truly great in it's own uniqueness, the actual space that it inhabits is a very small area. Moreover, it is essential to note that there is a fence around the actual Watts Towers. There are periodic daily tours where you can actually move in and among the towers but other than that you cannot come in close and get touchy-feely with the creation other than at those time periods.Also, it is important to note, for tourists who are not from Los Angeles, this is a very downtrodden area of the city. (This is not a criticism, it is simply a fact). Some people may actually be scared to visit this location. There is a security guard who watches over the property but be advised you are traveling to a very sketchy area of the city when you visit Watts Towers. In fact, driving to this historic landmark may make some people very nervous.All this being said, this is truly one of the most interesting and artistic creations that was born out of the community of Los Angeles, California. For this and many other reasons, Watts Towers is one of those locations that you must see.",Scott S
40,Fascinating work of art,"I was in the Watts district of Los Angeles for a meeting and was only a few blocks from the Watts Towers. Having lived in LA all my life, this was really the first time that I saw the Watts Towers close up walking around the enclosure area of the Towers. It was not open at the time for tours so I could only walk around and see some of the display boards around the outside and see the Towers. There is a nearby building that contains the history but it was not open. Nevertheless, it is an impressive set of towers that were built by Simon Rodia over many years. It is a personal expression of his art and is truly a joy to see. I look forward to returning soon and being able to go to the museum and actually get inside the fence and see it really up close.",geotech522
30,nice to do,"I would not rate that site in such a high place and define the twoers as ""must see"" just ""nice to see"" is enough the site it is locatedon the way to the airport if you have half an hour before arrival to the airport it will be perfect for that task",AVINOAM R
50,"I can see why the reviews are divided, BUT...","Standing outside the fence, looking in at the installations, you may be underwhelmed, as some have been. However, take the time to go into the adjacent centre, watch the short film and do the tour & you will have an appreciation of the whole installation that those who just look through the fence will have missed.Once you know the story of the towers and the amazing way in which they were constructed, and the quirky man behind it all, you will appreciate them as they should be appreciated.And, yes, the area around there is pretty darned seedy, so I can see why their last tour is at 3 - especially in winter, as once it gets dark I don't think that you'd want to hang around!But the centre, art installation, street parking right outside, etc are all safe to visit & enjoy during the day.Those who have found it underwhelming have made that judgement made solely on outward appearances & based on their own ignorance of the hard work and significance of the towers. So, if you're just going to look through the fence, I'd give it a miss, but if you're willing to watch the short film & take the tour, I really don't think that you could be disappointed with Watts Towers.",Dromomaniac
10,nothing worth seeing.,It's really nothing to look at. Not even sure why it's on the list of things to see and do. I guess it matters for some reason.,Ken K
40,Interesting Structure,Watts Tower is one of those strange interesting things are fun to stop to see. Had heard of it and seen pictures of it for a long time. It is an interesting art work. I didn't do the tour but there are bill boards along the fence that tell the story and you see the whole thing from outside the fence.,e a
50,Do the tour!,"We went with a group of friends early on a Saturday. Make sure to do the tour! At first we were a bit disappointed because at a distance, they are not so impressive. When you go into the center and watch the short film, you begin to gain an appreciation for how amazing the structures are...built by one man with no machinery. Then when you go inside for the tour, you can see all of the details that cannot be seen from the street. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable. This was a first for most of my group and we all said that we would recommend it to our friends!",felises
40,Interesting,"I have lived in LA for many years and did not know about the Watts Towers until I saw them in the movie La La Land. So, I finally took a trip to go check them out. The whole story behind it is interesting, and I think it is worth a visit. Aside from the guided tour around the towers, there is also a short movie about the man who built the towers himself, Sabato Rodia, over the course of 30 years. Check it out!",KTITA
50,Quirky and fascinating!,"This is my new favorite not-the-ordinary-outing for our out-of-town visitors. The towers are right there in the middle of a residential neighborhood, and the entire visit, including an informative tour, can be accomplished in under an hour (actually around 40 minutes if you timed it right--30 min's for the tour, and 10 minutes to watch the video on the tower creator, Simon Rodia. Everything about this attraction is quirky and fascinating.Well worth the $7 charge for a tour, which is scheduled on the hour and the half (be sure to bring cash!)",TrDCpr
10,A Waste of Time,"This display is just towers of junk that someone threw together. I found it uninteresting and a waste of time. People have made a bigger deal of it than it is worth. Also, the attraction is in the Watts Area of South Los Angeles and not a very safe area to be in.",Metrotorrance
50,A must see in LA,"This place is a hidden gem, unique and inspirational. It is moving to witness the persistence and imagination of a person and how this transforms a place, an area and encourages each of us to be inspired, to live to our highest and best. The tour guide, Ms. de Torres, is filled with such knowledge and narrative expertise. The art gallery is wonderful to walk through and the neighborhood is vibrant.",Fernando_BOSguy
50,Wonderful Piece of Local Art and History,"You will not be disappointed. Great way to spend a hour or two. Take the tour, watch the movie in the museum and look at some local art. Our tour guide, Howard, was funny, informative and kind.",S B
50,Must go!,I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised!! I was there on a Wednesday and unfortunately the museum is open Thursday to Sunday.I walked around the towers and got a brochure from the museum office. It's just amazing what this man did. I enjoyed reading the history. It was scheduled to be torn down and a group saved the towers and now it's on the national historic registry. Just fascinating.Don't be afraid of the neighborhood. I'm sure in the 1980's it was very different than today. I actually thought the area was very clean and well kept up with no trash.The towers are coming up on their 100th birthday. I think in 2020 if my memory is correct.I'm very much looking forward to going back and spending a couple of hours there.Very highly recommend.,maryaling
50,Don’t let anything stop you!,"Growing up in SoCal I had heard of these towers but knew nothing about them. It took moving out of the country and then returning as a visitor for me to make the trip into L.A. to see them. If you are a SoCal local DON’T make the same mistake! These towers are indeed one of the most significant public works of art in the world and the history of Simon Rodia is fascinating. Be sure to go Wednesday – Sunday when the Visitor Center is open and make sure to take the guided tour, it is well worth the $7. Our guide Lucy was engaging and well informed on the towers making their history come alive. The staff in the visitor center could not have been nicer and more helpful in making sure we learned as much as we could in the time we had. As for the safety of the area… yes, I had the same concerns, but they were absolutely unwarranted. The neighbourhood is clean and the residents obviously take pride in their homes and embrace their close proximity to the towers with beautiful tile work on their walls. Never during our visit did I feel the least bit concerned or unsafe. Best parking is along Santa Ana Blvd, NOT on 107th St.",fincaran
30,A quick pass through,"We visited directly from LAX airport! It was nice, interesting history of the man who made it, very LA. We did not do the tour but you can see the towers and mosaic-type art from outside the gates. There is a self guided tour with plaques to read outside. I did not feel unsafe around the area. It merits a quick stop but nothing else. I prefer Philadelphia's Magic Gardens more. Similar mosaic art but more of it, you can walk through it and more interesting.",DistrictofColumbia
50,It's far out and out of the way,This was one of the places I wantedTo visit in LA. It did not disappoint. It is quirky and unique. So much fun for an artist to visit. The only draw back is that it is tucked away in Watts (yes the Watts of the riots). Worth seeing if you get a chance. Pictures don't do it justice.,mehetabell
50,Well worth the excursion to see this famous sculpture,"There are a number of autodidactic, ""outsider"" artists that have left some mark on this world, but Sabata Rodia's Watts Towers is an example of such a work, and such an artist, that surpass what they ever expected.The sculpture (the tallest feature is 99 feet tall) is situated in Watts, unfortunately known for the 1965 riots that bears the neighborhood's name and one of LA's poorest districts. The sculpture is now a State Historical Park, and has short hours (check the website to be sure) and is not open every day; however, since it is outdoors, you can visit any day of the week and see it.Note: Street parking, while free, is limited.",djirsas
40,Amazing details!,"Watts towers are surely something unusual to see in this huge city and probably throughout the rest of the world. A monument that remains as one of a kind, which was built only with the use of makeshift materials, its a bit off the beaten track from the usual tour of Los Angeles, but if you have a little time it's worth having a look and taking a few pictures.",Travelcooking
50,Pay the 7 bucks to go inside!,"An eccentric old man built the watts towers out of broken bottles, plates, wire hangers and seashells in the 1920s. Today you can see it from the street and take pictures if you're so inclined or you can go into the community arts center, pay the $7 and have a tour of the inside.I'm recommending the tour for a couple reasons. First of all it is pretty magical to stand directly under the towers and to really examine up close the materials used to build them. The whole place is actually more colorful than it comes out in pics. Second, with the price of admission you get to hear about the entire life of the man that built them and why he built them. It's a short and interesting presentation. Lastly and most importantly, places like this don't just maintain themselves. The watts tower community arts center maintains this amazing artwork, they educate the public, they offer free arts classes and the like for community children and they support local artists. Paying the $7 benefits a lot of people and community initiatives and I for one am happy to pay.",Sara L
30,You see this picture.. you're seen it all,"Skip paying the $7 to walk on the other side of the fence.. there is nobody to take your money anyways. Just walk around. Information as to who, what and why are on the fence, and pictures are better from the open air arena spot on sight. The neighborhood is sketchy as it gets darker, so daytime is your best bet.",Hanna J
40,A dedicated artwork with a great story,"Whilst one of my most challenging drives of my month long stay in Hollywood, (driving on the opposite side of the road ...), this was a very pleasurable venture to see a dream realised for the community there, awesome structure about 'hope' and endurance, well worth essential viewing on an trip in LAX.",CultureCoacher
50,A one-time must see,"Tours are on the half and full hour. We just missed a tour, fortunately, so we were shown a video/documentary, which was short but good. The tour is $7 for adults, under 12 free. I was wondering what we were going to see that we couldn't get from pictures....tons! Definitely, worth the trip. Ride the Metro Blue line and get the full experience!!",Orange Crush
50,I am looking forwatd to a return visit some day!,"I have visited Watts Towers twice, both times back in the 1980s. One occasion was for a visit to the Towers and a music festival, a fabulous day with friends outdoors, and once with a dear friend, just the two of us for a more contemplative art day. It is a fantastic landmark of Los Angeles and a brilliant place to marvel at art and architecture.",elainesokoloff

50,Inspiring Testament to Human Spirit and Determination,"Simon Rodia's 'Watts Towers' is a magnificent testament to the power of the human spirit and determination. Constructed over more than three decades using primarily scrap materials, one man built a remarkable series of tall towers and other works of art to testify to his longing for his native Italy, which he had not seen since he was young. He worked every day building more and more until the highest tower reached 99 feet, doing all the work alone and without more than his safety harness to keep him from plunging to the ground below. Decorated with old pieces of soda bottles, tiles, and the bottoms of Milk of Magnesia bottles the various structures show an eye for design and a self-taught engineering plan, they collectively represent an awesome achievement of the human mind and heart. On the Register of National Historic Places, it is a must see especially to dramatize the singular strength of human perseverance and dedication to goal achievement.",Norman A
40,Finally made it,"We've been to the States many times and figured it was about time we visited this place. It didn't disappoint. The actual towers were was closed the day we were there, but we still got to see all we wanted. The visitor centre was open and they had a great video of the sculptures history. Glad we finally made it there!",Nick N
50,A Gem in the Middle of LA,"I was born and raised in Southern California and have never been to the Watts Towers until this year! What an amazing feat this man accomplished in the 1920s! Pictures do not do it justice. You need to take the 30 minute tour and walk around, in, under and through the towers to experience the extreme detail of his art!The tour is $7 per adult and is followed by a short video telling about the life of Simon Rodia. Do not let the location dissuade you from going, if you love history and/or art you should make time for this gem!",LadyDiButterfli
50,Outsider artist creates world class landmark,"Since I was a kid I've heard about the legendary Watts Towers and the heroic grassroots efforts that saved this unique structure from demolition. Finally made it here, and it was definitely worth the trip. This landmark sits in a very modest neighborhood in Watts, just down from the railroad track (now light rail corridor) and across the street from tiny working class bungalows still occupied by the working poor, as they were when Simon Rodia first bought the property and started building. The Charles Mingus Community Center and adjacent art gallery provide a community focus and support for the monument, which is really just an outdoor sculpture. But man oh man - what a sculpture! Docent led tours are the only way to get inside the compound and really experience it. The price is quite cheap and well worth the time & money. It is telling, too, for a comfortably middle class visitor to drive down from DTLA through the warehouses, salvage yards and shops of gritty working class LA and be reminded that there are many ways to live in America. It's refreshing to see the many ways we all can live together in peace and harmony. You can also take the Blue Line to a rail station less than a quarter mile from the towers.",peter s
40,"No tours on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays","We visited on a Wednesday - one of the days when tours are not offered. Therefore the towers could only be viewed through the fence. However, this was fine for us because we could see the detail of the inlaid work perfectly and the towers themselves are clearly visible. We watched a short 12 minute video in the visitors centre/museum which described the artist/sculptor Simon Rodia's singular vision and included marvellous old footage of the artist at work on the towers. Afterwards we had a quick and inexpensive meal at the nearby ""LocoL"" restaurant which aims to bring a little healthy eating to Watts. This was only a short drive from the towers. Overall it was a worthwhile excursion into a disadvantaged area of LA not on the mainstream tourist's agenda.",Happytravellerabc
50,An enduring gift of gratitude which has enriched the neighborhood and all Angelenos.,"The 1st time I ever saw these glorious Towers was in my childhood in the 50s. My folks were so interested and felt it was so important that they brought us up from San Diego to visit. (not easy in the 50s, no modern freeway to carry us there!)I now live in Los Angeles and have visited many times, most recently to show them to out-of-state guests.They are so stately and artistic. A true wonder of how Mr. Rodia was able to accomplish this feat with no formal engineering education.It has an interesting history, sad that the City of Los Angeles deeming them unsafe, tried to pull them down long ago. They did not budge but rather bent the equipment being used.Be sure to take the tour ($7, call for times), if you do not, you will not actually be able to enter the property and walk among the towers. If you come when there is no tour, you may still see the towers through the surrounding fence. Even that much is exciting and thought-provoking.",oma664
40,Took my wife and two daughters to this very historic place,"These towers are not in the best neighborhood in the world, but it was safe for us.

It is Simon Rodia's magnum opus and nearly a hundred years after he started creating this iconic piece, it's story and his story is both an education and an inspiration. $7.00 includes a guided tour and entrance to the adjoining art gallery. Maybe we lucked out and maybe they are all this good, but our tour guide today expertly melded humor, art appreciation and the understanding that for all of us, Simon Rodia included, life is complicated and sometimes heartbreaking.",RBarnhart

Anyhow, it is an amazing structure and very interesting to look at.",boymomdfw
50,You Are Going There,"So, this guy named Simon, from Italy, moved to Watts sometime in the 20's. He worked in construction and in his back yard, at night, and on his days off, he started work on his towers. It is said he was sort of a strange guy, but wanted to do something great in his life. The towers started as one and grew and he figured out ways to attach them and to put tile in the structures, all different types of tile.It is old. It was almost torn down once, people just did not go and it was in such disrepair, but it was saved.It is now a tourist location and when open (call first or go to their website) they have tours and you will learn about Simon and the history of these odd, yet strangely beautiful towers. The towers are something you will never see again in your life. Simon was not a trained artist and his towers were not really made to last, but they are maintained now and he loved his towers. It is what he left the people of Watts.Now, I know that Watts has a bad reputation for drugs and gangs and terrible things, but you really will be fine there.There is security and Watts is more of a working class neighborhood and not as crime ridden as you are lead to believe. Are you going at night, heck no, you are going in the daytime and you will be fine, you will learn of sweet Simon and admire his dream. He deserves that I think.Make sure you have the address in your GPS or really good directions, remember this is a neighborhood and it is not on a main street.Have fun and wish Simon well in his dreams.",elizabethlascheid
40,Strange but Interesting,Quite difficult to find as they are not on a main road. The structures are quite fascinating. Incredible to think they were built by one man.,RorysRavers
50,Amazing history in my backyard.,"Honestly Watts was a bit scarry for me so I told the kids ok, we will go. I will drive around and you take pictures. I felt so embarrassed when I got there and saw lots of turist with their expensive cameras.

50,Well worth planning so you can do the tour,"I had been previously when the site was not open to tours. You can walk around the outside and view the structures but this time we went on a day when tours were available. For a nominal fee, you get someone who can explain the background of the site. And our tour guide Lucy was excellent and also pointed out details in the design that you would miss if you just viewed on your own. There is also a 10 minute video that shows Simon Rodia, the creator of these weird, wonderful towers at work. It is amazing that this little man who was less than 5 feet tall would make 6 hour round-trip walks down the railroad tracks to Long Beach to collect odds and ends that he could use in his art creation. That he had no math or engineering background yet constructed these towers that withstand earthquakes. And that living on very little money himself, he became known as the ""candy man"" in the neighborhood as he would pay neighborhood kids to bring him bottles, tiles, etc that he could incorporate into his work. Then the kids would head to the candy store. What a great little piece of history restored here and very friendly staff in the art center!",WiTraveller608
40,Long Time Coming,"Ever since I first started reading about the history of architecture in Los Angeles, I'd wanted to visit Watts Towers and this April it was finally time to do that. The Towers are so unique; they are a solo work of art by a man totally dedicated to their construction and only that. They are pretty remarkable to visit. The tour is very short (like 15-20 minutes), but there's a video after the tour that adds to the experience so much that I almost wish they showed the video first. The experience is really pretty cheap ($7 each). You won't find this sort of thing anywhere else really. I recommend a visit, but it's not going to fill a big block of time.",jonathanhopwood

50,A gem hidden in Watts,"The city of Watts has a strong history , but within this history is a story to be experienced. That of an Italian immigrant , who after losing contact with his children began an odyssey. We all wonder what we will leave behind after we pass, and part of that legacy is a community who saw true expression of art and not an eyesore that needed to be torn down and fought to keep it in the community. There are tours every half hour for 7$ that will give you an inside look but it can also be appreciated from the street.If you enter the museum of art where you can watch a documentary , there are NO PICTURES ALLOWED",Arestrepo111
30,Interesting and Kinda strange looking Tower,This tower is in the middle of the famous Watts area of LA where African-American civil rights engagements. The area welcomes all people and is historic for it's arts and cultural events. I saw an art exhibit of a cousin of mine there. At the time the Tower event was connected to a Japanese cultural event. Little Tokyo is a close neighbor.,ronb753

The site has evolved to include a small museum and a terrific (necessary) guided tour by a knowledgeable host. This is an important slice of history in LA and it is very beautiful, with cultural significance. The exhibit at the small museum was worthwhile and quite good, with important pieces including Noah Purifoy, whose work I love. Next door is a small new and very nice community center with clean bathrooms and art classrooms.

50,"""Nuestro Puebio"" Meaning Our Town - Watts Towers Los Angeles","A true life story about an Italian immigrant who emplifies the meaning of what America was founded on and is a shining example of the ""American Dream"", the main reason so many people come to the United States.Simon (Sabato) Rodia an Italian who came to the United State dreaming of becoming ""Something Big"" in a land that one could make a reality. Simon passed away in 1965 and left the Towers and property to a neighbor never to return to see his beloved towers he worked and labored over for 33 years..Simon began work on the towers in 1921 - 1954 33 years and was only built by him alone with no help from anyone. His day job was working at the Malibu Tile Company for 8-10 hrs and then come home to work on his beloved ""project"". A labor of love, some would say that was the driving force that kept his dream alive.Built with only Hand Tools with no help from modern machinery or any one, he only used his two hands to create a masterpiece that have been admired by Angelio's and tourist from just about every country in the world. He was inspired and a huge admirer of great men like Galio, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, who he fashioned himself after such great men that he admired so much.The Watts Towers is a L.A. destination that should not be missed. There is a 15 min. film of Simon in the art gallery. You can take a docent led tour for a nominal fee or you can walk freely around the Towers. The Towers are accessible via Blue Line Metro Rail. Starting at Union Station take the Red Line to 7th and Metro, transfer to the Blue Line to the Watts Towers.",Brian L
40,Art from two cultures - Italian & African American,"I'm a Caucasian female native Californian and at 60 this was my first visit to Watts. I'm not sure what I thought the Watts Towers experience would be but I was charmed.First, you turn off a busy street and the Towers are tucked in a quiet neighborhood located on a cul-de-sac, adjacent to a small neighborhood park. The Towers are visible from the street and protected by a wrought iron fence.There is some sparse information on the fence, but the short film and intimate guided tour reveals the story of the Italian immigrant who honored his childhood memories by creating the colorful inspiring metal, stucco, tile and glass art piece collectively known as The Watts Towers. Without any help whatsoever, he completed a complex work of art with one constant theme - a tribute of his journey from Italy to America. There are three towers with the tallest Tower reaching an impressive 99.5 feet.In addition to the Towers, the visitors' center contains an art gallery with artworks depicting the African American experience of racism and suppression. I found this exhibit enlightening and thought provoking. I think these attractions are worthwhile and I certainly recommend them for children 5 years to seniors.",Bellauno
50,The great work of a visionary man,"Even though they are out of the beaten path, the Watts Towers are absolutely worth the trip. The guide is quite knowledgeable and will answer all possible questions. They are the result of 34 years of work of Simon Rodia, a visionary Italian immigrant who built them WITHOUT the help of machines, just with his hands. The towers are made of recycled material, like steel pipe and rods, seashells, tiles, glass, mirrors and broken plates. I could go on and on to describe them, but you have to see them by yourself and be inside the precinct to get the feeling.",EmanuelaDC
50,One man's vision and gift to humanity,"This was the third time I have visited the Watts Towers and I never get tired of it. Located in a poor section of Los Angeles, it was a creation built by one man, Sam Rodia. Sam was an immigrant who arrived in the United States from Italy at the turn of the 20th Century. He had worked in a variety of manual labor jobs and ultimately worked for a tile company. In 1921 he purchased a piece of land at 1761-1765 107th Street and began construction of his architectural masterpiece. Using scrap materials including steel, tile, glass and anything else that caught his fancy, he built a towering structure that still stands today. adjacent to the structure is a small museum that provides background on his endeavors. There is a small fee to tour the area with a fabulous guided tour of the property. Not to be missed! The neighborhood is poor and may make some people uneasy but I have never had any problems there.",Doug D

50,Impressive piece of historic art exhibit,"Didn't manage to come on a tour while I was here, but I definitely spent a little time admiring this impressive piece of work from the outside.

40,Fun place,"Let me start with, as I usually do, talking about the people who rated this one star. Those who took public transportation... Did not do their research! This is south central. Basically anybody who lives in America knows Compton is basically the worst area along with harlem. Well this is almost right next to Compton. If you did not take a tour or your own car- you have a low chance of having a good experience. There are lots of gangs so be smart. If you take a tour or car you will be fine- once you are there you are safe. This is a tourist attraction so there are guides and police so it's not just you and a couple of thugs. Also- I would rate this 5 but considering how many fun things there are in LA don't bother wasting a whole precious day on this unless you have many open days or do many things in one day. If you are staying in a nice area like hollywood or Beverly Hills, this is very far- the other side of town. So again do your research, be smart, stay safe, this will be fun. Sure the building isn't that amazing compared to that church in barca that other review said this is a bad version of, was made by hundreds of people, this was made by a local out of kindness by himself. It is made of TRASH! It's pretty cool.",Lngtraveler123

50,Absolutely amazing to see!,"You have to go and see the towers at least once in your lifetime! The story behind the towers was very interesting, the tour guide was very knowledgeable and answered everyone's questions professionally. There was a nominal fee to go inside the gated area of the towers, and a small museum of artists from the area. There was even a 15 minute video about the creator of the towers which helped you to understand the man behind the towers. Sadly though, the neighborhood surrounding the towers could really use a large trash can, a strong back, a good broom and rake, to bring the neighborhood back to it's once vibrant beauty.",charlottesl
40,A Public Art Treasure,"My only free day in the area was unfortunately on a Tuesday, when it's closed. You can still see the towers from outside the fence, but no tours that walk you through the structures.Simon Rodia's towers are like an antidote to stereotypical LA. It's in a not-so-great neighborhood whose other claim to fame is the riots of 1965 and has been beset by socioeconomic troubles since then. In contrast to the money and glitz just miles away in Hollywood, Rodia's ""Nuestro Pueblo,"" as he called them, was made by one guy over 33 years using scrap rebar, found objects, and a homemade concrete mixture. It's a testament to the imagination, dedication, and creative vision of an ordinary guy achieving extraordinary things against all naysayers, city bureaucracy and regulation, and unhappy neighbors.",D C

10,Stay away if you value your safety,"I consult with the Los Angeles Police Department and study crime statistics in the area on a regular basis. While Watts is not my particular area of focus (my research is mostly in the area of the 77th Street station), I can tell you to be warned that there are eight or nine violent crimes in this area every day, including about 14 homicides every year on average. So you have a 1 in 26 chance of being there on the day of a murder - possibly being a victim yourself. Tourists are a prime target of robberies and assaults. We also get reports of people being accosted and verbally assaulted here and on the metro system in the area.That being said, you are safest not visiting this attraction. If you insist on coming here, do so with a tour guide (more people means a lower chance of being targeted). Be aware that a good portion of the youth in the area are members of violent street gangs and that chances are high that they are armed and dangerous. Do NOT under any circumstances come here at night. Your actions WILL be monitored by the gangs and if you are deemed to be a threat to any of their activities, you stand a very good risk of being attacked.",Enki D

I couldn't walk through them, but I'm glad I got to see them, even if it was through a metal fence.",evanscaribbean
30,Not that impressive everybody says...,"Im disappointed :/Im not talking about the story behind Simon Rodia, im talking about the experience at the towers itself.They are much smaller than expected and not as impressive as on all the pictures you find on the web. As another review here on yelp says: ""It´s interesting but nothing spectacular"".the towers are worth to see when you are in the area (for example when you are planning to go to the science center), but it doesnt make sense to drive an hour just to see them.

50,A Spectacular Monument to a Common Man With a Vision,"Although our recent trip to Los Angeles was to focus on another museum exhibition, we elected to take some time and go see the Watts Towers. What a wonderful experience!The mind cannot barely comprehend the drive and artistic vision of Sam Rodia, an italian immigrant who arrived in the US at 15. He worked around the country before settling in LA. He labored all his life at full time work and in his off hours began this monument.He was a cement worker and worked with tile as well so it is no mistake that the towers are concrete and tile and glass over metal and other armatures. Sam intentionally purchased a triangular lot so that his work resembles a ship, possibly the one that brought him to America.He worked on this monument for over 30 years and I honestly cannot see how a person who worked a job full time could ever accomplish this. But he did and it is our obligation to go and witness the craftsmanship and hard labor that went into the Towers so that Sam's efforts will continue to be honored.The staff at the Watts Towers are dedicated and as nice a group as you will ever encounter. Make the time. This should be on everone's bucket list!",tshubert
40,"Fun little detour, a nice change from the big attractions and crowds of LA","I had been to LA several times and always meant to see this. Even if the artwork itself doesn't interest you, it's a bit fun to make the trip and see the ""other"" side of LA, as most tourist attractions inevitably focus on the wealth, glitz, and glamour of LA. It's a quiet, uncrowded attraction, in a neighborhood full of tiny bungalows. I was there on a closed day where tours aren't running, but you can still view it through the fence and read the history. There is a security guard on site if you are concerned about the neighborhood.",talktobrent
50,Unique is an understatement.,To call the result of 34 years of night and weekend labor for italian immigrant Simon Rodia begining in 1921 unique is an understatement.What is more valuable is that it serves as an anchor for a park and art gallery/museum about the history of Watts.For those of us old enough to remember the explosion of violence and fear in 1965 that was Watts that served as one of the many catalists for change in America.It is actually great yo come to this historic area to see its current evolution and enjoy this amazing work.Make the trip!,PhillipJalowiec

40,Diamond in the rough,"I reluctantly accompanied my husband to the The Watts Towers, but was glad I did in the end. Some of the areas we drove through to get there made me a little uneasy, but once we got to the Tower it was a beautiful piece of urban art. The story behind the junk is what makes it most interesting. I don't think I would take public transportation to get there, but if you have a rental car and go during the day you will have no problem parking and getting out to snap a few pictures and read the posted information.",JetSetFiend
50,"Moving, Inspiring: Rodia is LA's Gaudi","Watts Towers was one of the best things I saw on my recent trip to LA. Depending on where you're staying, it may feel a little out of the way but it is definitely worth the trip.The Towers were built over time by one man who was never classically trained as an artist. Rodia was a construction work and installed tile. He applied these skills to creating his vision, which is beautiful and inspiring. If you're familiar with Antoni Gaudi, you'll see echos of his work here.Though some may say that this is in a ""bad neighborhood"" I would push back on that notion. A LOT. I never once felt unsafe. In fact, I got into a conversation with a neighborhood resident about the Towers, and it was clear that there is a lot of pride in the community associated with them. Once you learn the history of the Towers, you know that the surrounding community has fought to keep this piece of public art alive. It is an integral part of the experience.In a city known for its energy and perpetual reinvention, it is refreshing to see such a beautiful work lovingly cared for and preserved.Tips: The tour is a must, if you're going to get a full sense of Watts Towers. You may want to call ahead to see when the tours are scheduled so you can plan accordingly.",christinetv

We walked around afterwards and thought it was inspirational what one man achieved.",NicBees
40,Cool,Cool sculptures. The day I went was a Friday but they were closed. It was the day after Thanksgiving. Sucked I wasn't able to get in and get an even closer look. But even if the gate is closed you can still wander around these structures and read about their history and get some good views. It's a really interesting piece of Los Angeles history. One that I'm sure a lot of people have never taken the time to go see.,Polaroids & Drinkin Stories
40,Nostalgic attraction from the 50's,I had not been to Watts Towers in 50 years. My friends that went with me got a kick out of the towers. It only takes 30 minutes to see the Watts Towers. Tours are run every half hour. You have to go on the tour to get up close to the towers.,bbilson
50,NOT TO BE MISSED,"It is a bit out of the way but if you are travelling south of LA, say to Long Beach or Laguna, the detour is worth while, a folk art created over a three decade period.It has been maintained very well since its completion in the fifties.The guided tour of the plot is worthwhile and very professionally done.",Oguz B
50,Genius,"That one man had the vision, stamina, creativity and skills to create this unique sculpture is amazing. And props too to those who have taken on the task of preservation!",CarmichaelVentura
10,Give it a miss,Do not attempt this trip without a taxi or car ! We made the mistake of taking the train : the walk to the towers is very long and far and let's just say that it wasn't very scenic or pleasant. Disappointing : my kids regretted going saying it was a major let down.,YasminHL
40,Worth a trip,"The Watts Towers were unique and awe-inspiring and well worth the trip to see them. We visited on a Saturday morning, and had no feelings of fear or trepidation about the neighborhood as others have mentioned. The staff was very helpful and you could see the pride they take in the facility. The guide for the towers enthusiastically explained the history of the towers and the artist who created them. My one complaint would be the brevity of the tour (30 min.) without time to walk around or ask many questions. It would be better if tours were offered on the hour for 45 min. instead of what is in place at present, to allow more time to ask questions and spend time seeing the details in Sam Rodia's masterpiece.",travel627
40,Good for a quick stop,"The towers are kind of off the beaten path, so it's a good drive by experience - there is not much else to see around here. It is inspirational however that they can be a positive influence on the neighborhood & they are fun to see!!",Bev C
30,Historical...,What an interesting piece of art. To be able to see this magnificent structure and remember what happened in this area many decades ago is an experience.But please do be careful if you come here.,Jamez N
50,One man's hard work,"20 minutes from the airport, to some might feel "" was it worth the drive"" , but if you can appreciate art and one mans hard work , it is a beautiful work of art. Reading history of it was even more interesting. Situated in a location one would not imagine a tower in, it is truly an amazing work of art!",sanjulakula
50,Beautiful,I have wanted to see the towers for many years. They are truly a sight to behold. The fact that one man built these towers with nothing more than his hands is just amazing! Go see the towers if you appreciate art.,Frank C
50,A gem in the hood!,This is an attraction that should not be missed. I lived here for 30 years before going and it is amazing. You should definitely take a tour to get all of the history behind the towers and they also have a short movie with more info.,greeneyes7449
40,Worth the visit,"As a National Historical Landmark, the Watts Towers is well worth the visit. The area is not nearly as shady as I was lead to beieve. There is a Metro stop within easy walking distance. To get into see the building closer you must take a guided tour, which for some can seem quite expensive. Definitely watch the video. The Guide we had, Lucy was extremely informative in pointing out various features of the structure. I only wish that we could have had more time to look, The tour was 30 minutes and then you had to leave so that they could bring in the next tour group. There is a parking lot, but it is very small.",Clarina P
50,Must see,"First of all the photo's here do not begin to show the creativity of this place. In photo they just look like steel, but they are so much more that you must see. It is not just towers, but the creation is actually a ship. This creation is in the back yard of his house. Not much of the house left currently. The story of the man that built them and his thinking is so interesting. They do have guided tours that last about 30 minutes. I recommend you watch the short video before the tour. We were not told about it till after. This is located on a dead end short street. There is some parking along the street , but behind there is parking. We are seniors so the price was just $3 for tour, but I think $7 otherwise.",Tyke555
50,Take the tour! Fantastic!,"The Watts Towers is a folk art creation, built by a single man who had an idea that he wanted to ""do something big"" and boy, he did! There is an art center, park, and outdoor amphitheater on the property, but the reason to go is to see the Towers. They are amazing. There is really no way to describe what they look like up close; it's humbling, almost overwhelming in the way that all great architecture is humbling, a tangible reflection of the builder. Be SURE to take the tour; the docents are knowledgeable and the history is very interesting, but more importantly, you can't get into the structures unless you are on the tour. The towers are fenced and you can certainly walk around them, but to get inside, to walk through them and see them from all angles is truly an experience. There is a parking lot that is off of 107th St, but when you use a computer program to get driving directions, you get directed to the street address of the art center, which is on 108th St. Now, 108th St dead ends and there is almost no street parking, so there is a steady stream of people turning around, looking for a place to park. Just go one more block, turn onto 107th St and you'll be fine. Amazing. There are lots of things to see and do in Los Angeles, but this is not to be missed!",Carol B
40,Piece of LA Vision,"This is a really enjoyable short tour (1 hour) of a fascinating piece of naive artistry. It's a fairly big time investment--off the beaten track--and so possibly not worth it if you have a lot of other must-dos and no reason to be passing through on the 105 Freeway. But it is fascinating, inspiring, strange and wonderful. You have to be heads up about the neigborhood, but it looks very respectable these days and there's clearly neighborhood pride in this vision by Sam Rodia.",Miriam F
50,DONT MISS,Watt's Towers is an incredibly underrated and often missed public art piece in Los Angeles. I have met many people from LA who have never heard of it. It is a humbling experience to visit and learn about this incredible piece of art. It is more in the South Central area - daytime during the week trip if possible. The neighborhood is very respectful of visitors.,Katy P
50,Amazing landmark,"The Watts Towers were high on my list of things to see and are definitely worth the trip, even if you arrive after the last tour leaves like we did.The Towers are in the poor end of Los Angeles so they’re a bit of a trip from Hollywood but they’re worth it. Simon Rodia built some fantastic towers and they’ve been looked after well ever since. There is plenty of information scattered around the outskirts of the towers and lots of great photo spots with car parking nearby too.Our guidebook said not to visit at night and to be honest we could understand why however a visit during a bright sunny June afternoon was most definitely worth it and I’d recommend the same to anyone.",James P
50,One of the most interesting and fascinating piece of art I've ever seen,"I was struck and felt awe in front of the Watts towers, towers built by a humble but very gifted man in Watts, a suburb of Los Angeles where normally one would not go. It is really worth the visit, one remains shocked by the ability of building such beautiful ""light"" but durable and sturdy pinnacles that recall Gaudi's work, even if the artist did not even know who Gaudi was!",barbaralevic
40,Beautiful yet strange and almost surreal landmark,"As seen in a few music videos and there's a very similar landmark in the video game ""Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas"".I got there by taking the metro and getting off at Watts. Then it's a 5-10 minute walk to the Towers. Of course I was a bit wary of walking through Watts/Compton but it was hassle free visit.Worth a look if you're in the area or passing through.",HarroYip
50,Go! And take the tour,"Cool Art Center and the Tour makes it more memorable.There are a few other treasures to be found in this Art Center, so wonder around and explore!",Rowan H
50,What a slice of Americana,"The story of the Towers is amazing, the craftsmanship is amazing, the community surrounding it interesting. Would highly recommend, with an eye towards just how special the story is.Also, not sure who wrote about how dangerous the area is. I took the train there, biked around, walked around, it is a perfectly average African-American neighborhood. You do need to keep your head on a swivel, but don't you everywhere?",iamnyc
40,Surprising,"I've lived in L.A. a long time and finally visited. I was pleasantly surprised. First, the photos give you the impression that the towers are much larger than they are. I was imagining a gigantic lot with GIANT towers. In reality, this installation was done in the small side yard of the artist's home. Photos of the towers give the impression that they are rusty iron structures. Nothing can be further from the truth. Whereas the internals of the structure are iron, the entire visible portion of the towers is covered in tile, glass and other miscellaneous items found in the neighborhood. It's truly a work of art -- unique in every way.As far as the neighborhood being dangerous is concerned, it's true that venturing there at night is not recommended but the towers are not open at night (the entire attraction is fenced in). You COULD admire the towers from outside of the fence but if you walk to the neighboring museum and gift shop, you can buy a ticket for an escorted tour (worth it!) of the towers that will take you inside the gates for a closeup view.I'm very pleased I got the opportunity to view this piece of Los Angeles history and encourage others to do the same, Visiting during daylight hours -- by car or public transit -- is not unsafe, I saw plenty of children and women walking around the area with no fear in their eyes.",HopSkipJump
10,"Be warned, this is one of the most dangerous areas of LA",Although I respect the work of the people who are managing this unique place I think it's a really dangerous place to visit. Especially after the sun goes down you should stay away when your a tourist. Also do ABSOLUTELY not go there with public transportation. This is one of the most dangerous areas of LA and I think a lot of people are deceived by all the positive reviews.,Rob K
40,"Worth visiting independent, artistic installation","A quiet place with outstanding towers, which is made by an artist whose workshop and museum is just next to this Watts Towers. Remember to visit the gallery also!",Ken Liu
50,Thanks to Simon and his faithful staff.,I saw the Watts towers on a documentary called The Ascent of Man when I was probably 12 or so and I resolved to see them one day. It took me until I was 57 but I am so glad that I made good my promise to myself. It is not difficult to get there as there is a Watts Towers Metro Station. It was a bit depressing to see the vast sea of run down houses in South LA but it was wonderful to be greeted with such enthusiasm by the staff of the Watts Towers visitors’ center. My guided tour went for 20 minutes and cost seven dollars. My 11 year old companion entered free of charge. The guide was wonderfully knowledgeable and accommodating. The towers themselves are a marvel of ingenuity and the story of their construction is as unique as anything I have ever heard. I went on a Sunday morning because I was told that it would be safer at that time. I expect that Watts can be a dangerous place at nights but it is possible that even the felons of Watts would respect those who visit what must be a source of community pride.,Russell C
40,Watts towers,Watts towers are a wonderful piece of artifact in middle of a urban neighborhood....far away it dnt look like much but it hold great detail when looking up close.worth a visit if you in the area....,Bk103Cuz
50,I told them I would give them a great review!,"Visited Watts Towers today with my 81 year old mom and my 8 year old niece. We all had a great time! Every person in the Arts Center/Museum bent over backwards to ensure that we got the most out of our visit. They gave my niece an activity book of things to see and do in Los Angeles and a packet of seeds to plant green beans accompanied the garden literature. We watched the 10 minute film about the artist and his amazing journey. We enjoyed the art exhibit, the garden and turtles, but mostly we loved the towers! Unfortunately, we were there on a day that didn't include a guided tour. But the film prepared us for what we were seeing and the towers are completely visible whether the gates are open or not. Definitely worthwhile!",FresnoBartel
40,Interesting spot,"Very interesting, not so easy to get to and location not the safest. Go during the day with your own car. We didn't feel threatened. Were not able to get into the next tour so skipped it rather than wait 45 minutes. There is a small fee for the tour. There are informational placards on the outside of the fence to tell the story and history of the site. You can see quite a bit from the outside. Incredible that the artist did all the work on it and left!",Lola2104
50,Unique and Interesting,"The towers themselves are interesting from a distance but what really interested me were all of the thousands of tiny details. There were all sorts of artifacts pressed into the concrete that you can only see close up. Lately, I've been comparing the Watts Towers to the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain. Both are great works of art and architecture.",Larry W
50,The pictures do not do this justice,"Read about this on Trip Advisor, went this past weekend. Amazing to see. By all means, spend the money and take the tour. The story behind this structure brings it to even more life then it is. Totally recommend this to everyone! We also saw the movie that was being shown in the gallery.",sbenjamen
40,Interesting if you have some time.,"We had a very short window of time before we needed to be at the airport and decided to see the Watts Towers. I have to say from the photo, that I was expecting something much larger. The towers are impressive and the story is fascinating. We didn't have time to do the tour, but enjoyed seeing them from the outside. Our kids (11 and 13) thought they were interesting, but were done in about 10 minutes. The adults probably spent about 1/2 hour reading all the information (there are informative signs detailing the life of the artist and how he created the towers and other structures). We wouldn't go back, but would recommend it to others.",DanneD1
50,Interesting and Beautiful!,"Really enjoyed seeing these towers and the artwork surrounding them. We walked around the towers, took a few pictures, and were about to leave when we realized there was much more to see. We ended up spending another hour or so - we met one artist who told us about more artwork to check out, and while checking out that artwork, another artist told us to check out another building, and then another artist told us to take the tour...it was such a perfect day and we loved exploring and seeing all of the beautiful artwork by the different artists. Highly recommend the $7 tour, as you get a closer look at the details on the towers and hear the story of how they were made. Fascinating. Also recommend checking out the artwork in both buildings, the mosaic walls across the street, and the garden (with a turtle pond and beautiful potters and a sculpture). We loved it all and everyone was so friendly and helpful. Oh, and free parking right onsite.",Amy P
50,exceeded al expectations!,"We were a bit apprehensive to visit this area due to concern about the location, but am glad we went ahead. First of all, the area seemed fine. Like any big city, you need to take proper precautions and the same can be said for the area around the towers. There is parking and a nice park located next to this attraction, and is very easy to get to from the interstate. I would strongly suggest paying the $7/person fee for the tour. We had Noamie as our tour guide who had been a guide there for 27 years and had lived across the street even longer so on top of the great factual information, she also offered insight into the impact of the towers on the neighborhood. I would also suggest watching the 10 minute movie before the tour because it provides some great background on the builder and makes you appreciate the work all that much more. This is a fantastic structure with great history, I highly recommend it to all.",rduinc
50,Unbelievable work of Art.,"Maybe it's just me and my wife but no art we've ever seen has come close to impressing us as much as Mr.Rodia's towers, not even either of the Getty museums also in LA. Although far from a connoisseur i am rather familiar enough with art to have been to some of the worlds more famous museums and art gallery's, so although my opinion is limited i have seen a bit. I find it absolutely astonishing that he was able to make these on his own. If you don't get the tour the full effect is missed as the real breathtaking site is being inside the towers and seeing the way the light comes in and the overall ambiance of the display. Highly recommended, a little thing we weren't sure about doing really did become very memorable, i would not miss out on this given the chance as these towers won't be able to stand forever.",Kevin44444444

50,Watts Towers,This is a great historical landmark that I would highly recommend any one to visit. As a young child I lived at 1719 east 108th street. next to a Church. I would spend so much of my time seeing that very nice man put the tower together. I'm 68 years old now and It makes my heart feel good to have that memory. I did have a first-hand experiences. Thank you. Anna,Anna E

40,Great Historical Landmark,"This is a great historical landmark that I would highly recommend people to visit. The towers in the Watts area of LA are a testament to the old days of Los Angeles when it was unique and one of a kind. The tour available of the towers is well worth the $7 per person. A history of the towers and trip inside the site is included. People may caution you about the area, but staying on the main roads and locking your vehicle when not in it will keep you secure when visiting the site.",darrenesl
50,What a find in LA,"The Watts tower is one of the most amazing and inspiring sights I have ever seen.The creation of Simon Rodia it took him thirty years to construct then gave it away to his next door neighbour !

40,A local landmark,"The Watts Towers are a singular dream expressed and abandoned by the artist, yet saved by the community. After you visit the Watts Coffee House for your authentic soul food experience, visit the towers if only for a few minutes. If you have the time for the full tour, it is definitely worth it. Seeing the Watts Towers should be on every Angelenos' bucket list. A close local treasure.",inog
50,Simon Rodia's legacy -the Watt's Tower,"Visiting the Watts Tower was a powerful and humbling experience for us. It is amazing what a simple immigrant, with time on his hands can create with found objects.What a testimony to Simon Rodia's resourcefulness and patience to tirelessly scrounge for materials then single-handedly with primitive tools build a structure so massive! The man was recycling and up-cycling to create Art, inspiring later generations of eco-conscious ""Green"" Artists.We were much moved beyond words to hear Simon's solitary struggles recounted by the tour guide. What a great craftsman and admirable lone hero of the community! Hats off and a deep bow to Simon Rodia - a legend!",3Kells

30,"Fun to visit if you live here, not worth it if you don't","I can't really say anything really bad or great for that matter when it comes to the Watts Towers. Odd, different, a bit strange and more than anything else a literal and self made tribute to a VERY strange man who built/constructed/taped together/glued this bit of Los Angeles trivia. The neighborhood can be a bit dicey at night but it was fine during the day. If you live in Southern California it's well the hour or less (if you don't take the ""tour"") it will take you to walk around (not in) the towers. The on-site, tiny museum is an odd place with the few items shown not having much to do with the Towers other than a fairly boring video is still worth a quick look. The staff are quite nice.",Mark J
50,"Inspirational, Beautiful","I visited the towers with my 2 daughters, and niece (ages 8,9,11). I have been wanting to visit ever since I watched Huell Howser's visit in an episode of California's Gold. Yes, Watts does have some unsavory areas, but please don't let that stop you from seeing these beautiful towers. I did not feel unsafe during my visit, and am so glad that I finally was able to see them. I parked in the parking lot, and walked over to the art center to buy my ticket for the tour.Our tour guide, Lucy DeLatorre, was wonderful. She gave us plenty of information about the towers and their creator. She helped us to see the towers from different angles to fully grasp the magnitude and genius behind the artwork. The tour was only $7, a very reasonable price. After the tour we watched the short film about Simon Rodia. I must admit, the short film really moved me. Afterwards, we went to walk around the garden. There were children there from the community participating in a summer program through the center. The garden is still under construction, but is still very nice to check out. My kids loved it, and were inspired by what they saw.There will be a FREE Drum and Jazz festival on September 28-29 @ 1:00pmTipsTake the guided tourArrive before 1:00pmPark in parking lotBuy the bags of sage sold in the art center ($5 donation, and they come from the garden)watch the short filmIf you have kids, pick up the Watts Towers coloring activity sheets",michelle_p925

My wife and I felt safe and are very happy we included this attraction in our Los Angeles vacation.,Desert_Life
50,Interesting Architecture and Inspirational Story,"I was actually hesitant to visit this place since it's located in a very ghetto neighborhood, and this attraction is indeed in a residential area, because it was originally built at a backyard of a house. I was thinking maybe to just drive there and look at the architecture without leaving the car, but I'm so glad that I went in for a visit. The ticket is $7 for adults and $3 for seniors. When we went in and bought the ticket, the 1:30 tour just started, so we checked out their gallery where there are some African American arts on display, and we sat down in a media room to watch the documentary about the builder Simon and his story of building the towers (highly recommend before starting the tour). Then at 2:00, our tour guide Lucy took us and some others to tour the actual towers outside. Lucy was really wonderful, we feel we learned a lot about the towers and the story behind it, and it's quiet inspirational. Highly recommend for a one-time visit, it's well worth it.",Kevin S
40,Quick Art Stop,"This was a quick art appreciation stop. For $7 you get a 5 minute guided tour of the towers and to peruse the small museum of modern African american art next door. I'll leave the ""yes but is it art?"" question for others to ponder. Come see it for yourself. It's in the middle of a suburban neighborhood. Limited parking.",visi2r1
50,"SO Spectacular, I just HAD to write a review","Ok, I might as well fess up. I almost cancelled my plan to see this attraction. . I'm a lone , petite, female traveler from out-of state and I'm in the area for work .I've been planning see the Watts Tower for weeks but didn't want to visit it by myself due to the notoriously scary Watts neighborhood. So I asked a couple of friends who live in the LA area to come with me. Well, it turns out they didnt want to go anywhere near, much less hang out in SouthCentral LA even after I offered to drive so it's a no-go. But the adventurer in me prevailed so I decided to drive there by myself on this awesome Saturday so I could finally cross it off my ""Must-do before I leave LA"" list. It was sooo worth the drive! After following the parking tip from one of the previous reviews, I found the small parking lot behind the visitor's center in an alley off Willowbrook Drive right after 107th St. There were some tourists milling around. I didn't see any gang-member types and I didn't hear any gunshots,police sirens, etc at all so WHEWWW I felt safe in the area. I paid $7 for the 30-minute tour that takes you inside the Tower and it's highly recommended. There were only three of us in the tour so it was a personalized tour. You get to see the intricate details of his sculptures , take pictures and also view the "" ship"" that his colorful structures are suppose to look like . You can't see these details from outside the gate.After the tour, I went back to the visitor's center where I watched the 12 minute film about Watts Tower circa 1950's showing footages of Sam Rodia himself climbing and building the towers. It's truly amazing how one man without any formal education in Fine Arts could single-handedly build such spectacular sculptures . His vision and talent reminded me of the man who built the Coral Castle in Miami, FL. After the film, I still can't get enough of the Watts Towers so I walked around the Towers outside the metal fence and read all the informative signs and took more pictures . I also saw several scared tourists drive past the Towers just to briefly see it from the comfort and safety of the cars. I wanted to talk to them and encourage them to leave their cars and take the tour but I didnt since I might scare them some more thinking I'm up to no good. BTW in case you see some locals walking towards you while you're near the fence , there's no need to freak out. Chances are they are just on their way to the area behind the Towers where some locals like to hang out.I've never reviewed an attraction before since I usually review hotels but I decided to write this today since the Watts Towers really left a lasting impression on me . Don't even think twice about seeing it. Put your negative stereotypes about SouthCentral LA aside and JUST DO IT! Also , if you're planning to visit anytime soon, please consider signing the petition letters asking for more funding from LA County. You can get it from the gallery. Apparently, the Watts Towers was a victim of budget cuts so they really need our help.",journeysH2O
50,It was something that he just had to do...,"This gem of folk art in the middle of south south central Los Angeles is a testament to one man's strange drive to create, The story of Simon Rodia and his relentless quest to build these crude, yet strangely elegant and beautiful towers, minarets and spires is a fascinating tale. The towers made me scratch my head and ask why? -- while part of me seemed to totally understand the answer to that question. This section of Los Angeles has seen many, many changes through the years and somehow these towers have witnessed so many of them. The cultural center and the tours are worth the time and the small fee. The tour answers many of the questions that will come to mind while looking at and while walking through this sculpture -- the actual construction, the materials and the techniques that were used are just a few things that will be discussed. But some of the tour guides really seem to understand Rodia's soul and their interpretations of what may have been going on in his head are fascinating. In this world, there are countless works by great masters that have endured time, but there are few creations like this one. It is definitely worth an hour or two.",Observer333
40,Unique structure in risky neighborhood,"This triangular block located in the middle of the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles is covered with tall spires built by one man sixty years ago.

50,Megawatts,Any visit to Los Angeles is not complete without a visit to these unique towers. Simon Rodia put these together in his backyard over a period of 33 years in his spare time and it is an impressive achievement from an engineering standpoint and an artistic one. His use of recycled materials was ahead of its time. Eclectic and fun these spires resemble the work of Gaudi's Sagrade de Familia in Barcelona. Though not on that scale it defies the usual architectural assemblages.It is easily viewable from outside the fence but organized tours are available. It is currently being maintained and run by LACMA.,Mike G
50,Lovely to visit there,"It was a small adventure going there for a woman traveling alone. I was dying to see it, so I made up my mind to visit there during the opening hour on Friday.I took a train on the Blue Line from 7th st./metro center to 103rd st/watts towers. It took about 25min. I arrived at the station around 11:10am and could see the Towers from the platform. It was a 5 minute walk from the station along the tracks in a quiet residential area. I saw only a few people on the way to and from the towers.The Towers were beautiful and interesting as I expected. I am so glad to have been there. I didn’t feel unsafe but maybe I was just lucky to be back alright.",Katie1219
50,Interesting attraction,"This is a terrific piece of local art that is very impressive when you realize that it was built by a single person. The towers are somewhat reminiscent of Gaudi art. The art has a lot of discarded bottles, colored glass fragments and tiles, put together in clever ways.Check the website for hours. We went on Sunday and it opened at noon. The sculpture is surrounded by a security fence, and many parts of the art are visible from outside the fence. But a complete view requires a guided tour.If you arrive when it is closed, there are signs along the security fence telling about the history, and some nice photos can be taken through the fence.The tour doesn't take long, and once the tour is over, you are escorted outside the security fence. Thus, if you want photos, take them during the tour, take a lot of photos and sort them out later.The visitor center has other art on display, and has a short film about the towers. Rest rooms are inside the visitor center, so watch for hours of operation.The Towers are located on 107th street which is a short, very narrow, dead end street with houses along one side. A much better parking alternative is to continue about 20 feet past 107th street to an alley that leads to a small parking lot behind the visitor's center. The alley has a concrete address marker, about 2 feet tall, with in/out white arrows painted on the alley entrance. The marker is visible on Google Streetview.We approached the Watts Towers from the 105 freeway, and didn't feel uncomfortable driving to the Towers.",Tecolate
50,Terrific! Towers,"This place is fascinating! and impressive to see and experience. “Simon Roda” built a collection of 17 structures that reach up to 99 feet high. He built all the structures on his own using scrap metal, ceramic tiles, glass cups, plates, concrete etc. and any other pieces of scraps or trinkets he could find. The people that worked at the museum that gave the tours were helpful and nice and had interesting inside stories to share about Simon’s life.",Gypsyrose101
40,A very unique LA treasure and the product of one man's obsession,"Built by a poor Italian immigrant that settled near a railroad tracks just south of downtown LA, Sam (or Simon or Sabato, his birth name) Rodia spent 34 years (from 1921-1955) single-handedly assembling these towers (it's actually more of a ship than just towers) from junk that he picked up on the streets! What is even more fascinating is that he did not use any machines, scaffolding, bolts, rivets, etc to build them nor did he have any plans drawn out of them — instead, he had what he wanted to do in his mind and built them with only a few simple tools (including the railroad tracks to bend the steel), wire, and mortar cement. There are so many other interesting things to be said but I'll leave them to the visitor to discover. Oh, and take the kids as well...",Massimo M
40,Nice,It is truly something nice to witness. It does look a lot bigger and taller on pics then it actually does in person.,Patrick S
50,Amazing,Bizarre and amazing place. Good signs explaining the story behind the towers. Too bad everything is behind a fence.,wmleler
20,Don't go,"I went to LA the last month and wanted to see this ""landmark"" place. I went with a friend by subway from where you have to walk like 10 min to arrived there. While we were walking a police patrol stopped us and tell us that this place is very dangerous, one of the most dangerous places in LA. So they took us away.. of course, before they took us to the towers and really is not that amazing. They left us at the hotel recommending us not to go there again. So maybe if you want to go, go by car but I think is not worthy and is very risky.",LinaCobo
50,A unique site for romantic architecture buffs,"For Cultural Tourists, this place is a must-see. When you think that one elderly man built all the structures on the site, it's mind-boggling. And so inventive. There is an introduction by a short video and a brief talk about the builder, why he built it, etc. The docent we had was very informed and entertaining.The site is fairly easy to drive to, there is on-site parking and you can also take the Metro. On the same property is a new art gallery, showing Black artists' work that is sophisticated and of interest to anyone. There is also a small gift shop. Call ahead and don't go if it's raining (they don't do tours in the rain.)",Kay T
40,"Beautiful, but only open at random times.","I would love to give it 5 circles because it looks like it would be amazing to tour. But I can't believe how random it is that they only offer tours on like... Thursday and Friday, something like that. You can't even get inside unless you're on a tour. So you can look at it from the outside, which is cool, but as many people have noted, the neighborhood is super-sketchy, and it's kind of a long drive from most other areas of Los Angeles with tourist attractions. We drove a long way only to be told that it wasn't open, and that was really irritating.",Loretta P

50,Great example of Naive Art in Los Angeles,"One of the greatest historic sites to visit in LA, Watts Towers is a place everyone in LA should visit at least once. Unfortunately, people are too often reviewing Watts itself rather then the towers. Yes, Watts is a rough low income community. There are some really good people here, yet gangs, lack of jobs, poor educational facilities and much more plague this area. Nevetheless, if you visit Watts towers in the early afternoon and have your directions, you should have no problems at all.Watts towers is fortunate enough to have some excellent tour guides and unless you want to waste your time I highly recommend the tour. If you do not take the tour you can only view the towers from outside the fence and snap some pictures. The large towers themselves are not really the main (or only) attraction here, standing underneath the towers themselves and seeing the beautiful small touches Rodia put into his masterpiece was a highlight for me. Please do not let the negative comments about Watts detour you from this incredible place.",kjmagnuson
50,UNIQUE!,"This is a unique installation of ""folk art"". One of a kind. And a fun trip through a part of LA one might not ever go if there were no selected destination. Part ""art""......part ""archeology"".....part ""culture"". A great trip to take!",JerseyDriver
20,"OK, too far away",This is an ok attraction but be warned its in a neighbourhood that has a bad reputation and is practically impossible to reach easily by public transport,LA-JH1
50,Very interesting!,I like quirky places and this one fit the bill. I'm glad we took the tour ($7.00 per person) so we could get a close up of this incredible folk art structure. That it was built by one man without heavy duty equipment is amazing. We parked on the street which might be hard to find a spot when busy. Not sure if there was parking anywhere else.,zee74
50,Watts Towers provides food for thought about how an ordinary artist can make a difference,"The Watts Towers Arts Center and Watts Towers Charles Mingus Youth Arts Center are well worth visiting. The towers have levels of meaning that are only obvious when explained by the tour guide, the artwork that is displayed in the Center's gallery is evocative, and the collection of musical instruments is fascinating. It is however, tucked away in Watts, so you need a map or GPS to find it. Simon/ Sam Rodia was dedicated to his vision, and the staff who take care of it, and offer art and jazz programs for kids, are also dedicated and valuable. This attraction is really life affirming and inspirational!",Lynsawayfarer
40,An amazing piece of public art,"The watts Towers were built by an Italian immigrant who collected scraps of china, bottles, etc. which he used to decorate the towers which reach up towards the sky. There is a tour which you need to take in order to closely look at the towers -- they are gated -- and it is well worth it for the history and up close views of these extraordinary creations. Imagine elaborate sandcastles in the sky, then imagine more...",js551
50,AMAZING!,"For many years, when we have visited Los Angeles, we have talked about seeing the Watts Towers. We finally went this year and were absolutely blown away by the structure, the artwork and the story of the ""builder"" of the towers. Well worth a visit, though the half hour tour, while it covers the whole structure, barely allows you to really look at the structure and the tiling done by Simon Rodia. You can see part of the towers from outside the fence, but you should definitely take a tour (and come back again for several more tours) to really have time to look at it properly.",lilyemmaalec
50,"Fantastic, if a fair way off the beaten track","There's plenty of info available about the history of the towers on the net so I won't go into detail but the tallest tower is 10 storeys tall and the 'complex' is reputedly the biggest piece of folk art in the world. I read on a different review someone whinging about the price. Come on, $7 people, I'm sure it goes towards help preserving this piece of history (we actually donated an extra $6 into the wishing well box they have in the art centre to make up the difference to $20). You can just go look around the outside (it's fenced off) which is free and say that's it, I've seen it. To appreciate it you need to go into the arts centre, watch the video on its history and then get a tour guide to take you through the complex (that's what cost $7). Make sure you have enough change! Stupid us only took a $100 bill there (oops). It's amazing to see how much work one man put into these structures and the surrounds - basically Simon built this in his backyard! Everything in it, down to the boat sculpture at the front (which you can't see from the outside) has a purpose, as the guide explains. Our guide was very informative and knew every answer to every question we posed (there was only us and a couple from CA on our tour). They say tours are on a first come first served basis but it wasn't exactly jumping when we went (March 1, 2012). They say tours run every half hour and we rocked up right on 1pm and the guide sat inside for the next half hour and we had to wait till 1.30. It didn't bother us at all, we watched the video and walked arond the small gallery but I just wanted to mention it to let people know they should allow at least an hour once you get to the arts centre, just in case. Seeing all the bottles, tiles, plates etc in all of the concrete and all of the imprints Simon made... it's funny because they were astounded we came from Australia to see it because they said people in LA hadn't even heard of it! Our guide said he recently took an octogenarian into Watts and she'd lived nearby all her life and never even knew about it, It was only by chance we came across it on the net. Ok the kinda tricky thing is getting out there. We jumped on the Metro red line from Hollywood, got off at 7th St/Metro Ctr. From there you take the Metro blue line to the station called 103rd St (Watts is the suburb). It's a less than five minute walk from the station to the towers. You can see the towers from the platform. Look for the church away from the way you came in and the towers are just to the left a little further behind. Walk down Graham Ave, past the church. You'll see a very skinny park to your right past the church and you can walk through that. You'll know you're on the right track when you see a small concrete amphitheatre adjacent to the left of Watts Towers. Don't go into the fancy arts centre part to get tickets; there's a much older white building with a scuplture out the front and mosaic near the entrace right next to the towers to buy them - don't go into the door which says 'Security' which is the first door you pass when walking from the train station. There is a tiny sign on the door to the arts centre that says 'purchase tickets here' so if you find that you're at the right door. Must admit, the neighbourhood seemed a little scary - there's bars on all the windows in the homes in the area and we did not stay in the area to have lunch or anything, but the short walk down Graham posed us no trouble. Chances are, whoever you talk to who has been to LA has never been here so if you want to get some proper local culture rather than do everything that's offered by a tour company, this is the place to go. Would recommend it to anyone, even though we felt a little unsafe on the way there. Mind you, we were talking to a lovely lady who worked for Metro about the towers later that day, and she said she knew about it because she lived in Watts. So I guess perception is everything and our perception sucked. We had a brilliant time.but wanted to go a bit more in detail for people who may wish to see the towers in future on how to get there and what to expect.",Carmania
50,remarkable example of folk art,"Simon Rodia's towers in Watts are fascinating, in conception, in execution and in their story. Rodia built them by himself by hand, collecting pieces of ceramic and other discarded materials to decorate and highlight the substantial structure, which is built in the form of a three-masted sailing ship.Take the time to find the site in Watts.

50,Great reason for driving to LA,"Having heard of this folk art environment for years, we chose to drive from Indiana to L.A. to see this iconic construction for ourselves. in short, it was worth the effort!For those who do not know, one man spent much of his adult life building a concrete, three masted vessel to carry him back to his homeland. He built it so sturdily and artfully, incorporating shards of pottery and other objects, that it draws thousands of admirers every year. count yourself lucky if you get to see it.",Rod L
40,Well worth a couple of hours,"Ok, so this is definitely outside major Los Angeles area tourist sites, but is very easily accessible and if you're smart - you can stop by here on your way to something like the Lon Beach Aquarium. If you are a Los Angeles native then you have no excuse.Just to correct/comment on a few of the previous remarks:You can't take the blue line from Hollywood. The Red Line from Hollywood has a stop (7th and Metro) in Downtown that you can transfer on to the Blue Line. Either way, public transportation is very easy for this trip (and the rest of the way to Long Beach).Re: the safety of the place. It is surrounded by residential and mall strip type of development. It is poor. But this place is not unsafe. I'm still laughing at the person from the Tenderloin who was afraid to get out of her car. The Tenderloin is 10 x worse than this area during the day. Now at night (outside of the immediate Watts Tower area) - probably not the safest. But then again, you should never find yourself lost in this area at night.The actual site should be viewed as part of the tour - in other words, I recommend you pay for the tour. I would spend 1-2 hours here. Very neat stuff to look at and learn about - including the artist. After this, I would head back to Downtown and enjoy a couple of days there.",Thesweetscience
40,How Bizarre and a little bit off the beaten path,"After much ""debate"" with my husband, we decided to visit with our two sons (9&10). We were unsure of the safety of the neighborhood. We knew about the Watts Riots and travel books called it ""a seedy/inner city neighborhood"" We pulled up to the museum at 10am and were greeted happily by an armed guard. Being from NY where ""stuff"" happens everyday-we went. We are very glad we did. The gallery depicts impressive sculptures/artwork done by a local, visually challenged women. It also gives back to the community by providing programs for the local children. There is a brief 15 min movie as an intro. The Watts Towers and the story of Simon Rodia is very interesting and a bit bizarre. We found his work intricate and facinating - amazing and unusual. It can't really be explained by saying they are giant towers created by one man and then decorated in great detail with bits of ceramics and glass, but rather should be experienced if you are in the LA area. It's something off the beaten path and a little different from anything we've seen in our travels. Try not to miss it. Allow about two hours and take the tour.",lisamarie514
50,Engineering and Art,"The Watts Towers are an amazing combination of art and engineering. This was my first time in LA and I've read about the towers so I had to see for them. After I checked in I caught the Blue Line from Hollywood to Watts and walked about 1/2 mile to the site. I did not feel unsafe or threatened in any way, you just have to be smart wherever you travel.I would also recommend the culturally diverse Leimert Park/Leimert Village which is a short distance away, designed by Frederick Olmsted in the 1920's.",jghowardjr

A very enjoyable afternoon.",pinggirl
30,Be aware of the unsafe area around the towers!,"It may be unique or historical or whatever, but I've never been that scared!We live in the area that is becoming Tenderloin in San Francisco, but I would not be afraid to walk by myself. There was an area that was so dangerous, I didn’t even want to get out of the car, so scary it was. The towers are in a small public park, the security guard walked out of his hut to tell us about tours and to thank us for being brave to visit this area.",ImaMY
50,An amazing experience in south L.A.,"Before you go to the Watts Towers, find a copy of the book Beautiful Junk: A Story of the Watts Towers. My parents gave me the book when I was a child, and it was one of the few that I kept for my own children. I read it to them and to their classes in school. On Saturday, we finally had the opportunity to see in person the towers in all their glory.First let me say that I was scared to go to Watts. I envisioned a sea of people living in squalor eyeing us as we eyed their neighborhood relic. Not so at all. In a bright neighborhood on a quiet clean street, there is an arts center, a security office, and a set of towers to delight the senses. No one was about other than the visitors to the site and those working there, who were kind and welcoming.The Watts Towers are an incredible monument to making use of discarded items back before it was popular to do so. Simon Rodia, an Italian immigrant, built the towers in his back yard from discards he found and tile remnants he collected from his work. The artistry and technical workmanship that went into them make them exciting to behold. If you like Gaudi in Spain, you'll love the Watts Towers!",winwoid
40,An impressive & unique cultural monument,"Although Watts Towers is pretty far out of the way for most LA residents, it's well worth a visit. Be warned, the Towers' site is pretty undeveloped- the site consists merely of the Towers themselves as well as a small plaza surrounded by a quiet residential neighborhood. However, the plaza is impressive, and is a nice place to reflect. Also, there is a timeline that allows visitors to reflect on Watts' and African-American history, offering a sense of context for the beautiful towers and the neighborhood they lie within. Watts is a place to visit only during the day, so keep that in mind when planning your excursion. There's not much else in the surrounding neighborhood for visitors (except the Jordan Downs housing project, interesting to drive by for those interested in public housing and inner city poverty), but a use this as a jump off for exploring Expo Park/USC area or experiencing the local Latino culture along Pacific Blvd. in Huntington Park. Watts Towers can be your gateway to a side of LA often heard about but rarely seen, if you're up for the adventure.",arspickles
