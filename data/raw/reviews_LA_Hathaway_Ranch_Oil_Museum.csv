40,A very different sort of museum,"My husband loved all the old vehicles and machinery, my daughter and I loved the goats, chickens, turkey and cat. Abundant fruit trees, a house filled with assorted antiques. Not much in the way of organization, but a very enthusiatic care taker and a knowledgable docent to fill in some of the gaps. Sadly the ""big house"" is not open to the public owing to California's laws pertaining to the safety of masonry buildings and earthquakes.",Pauline K
40,"Cool, Free Museum full of antiques, farm animals and history!","I visited the Hathaway Museum with my 4 year old. We had some other errands to run in the Santa Fe Springs area, and saw this was nearby on our Passport2History Museum Program. The grounds are large and there is a lot to see. Watch for the sign as I drove by it the first time. It's a little confusing where to park, as when I went in I thought just the house on the left was the museum, but the entire grounds are the museums, so you can park anywhere. Just watch out for the chickens, roosters and cats running around!The docent was already mid tour, so another staff member caught us up to him. Full disclosure... by this time in the day, my toddler was in a bit of a mood, so he wasn't in the best place for a tour. The first staff member had told us there they had 25 baby goats, so my son was eager to get to that part of the tour. Our docent was very kind and knowledgable and gave a very detailed tour. It was a bit too detailed for my son's speed, so we had to cut it kind of short, but if you're intro history, I would definitely come back and check this place out because there is a lot to see! He said we only caught about a third of the place. There is a lot of cool oil stuff in the big mental oil tower which is now part of the museum. We didn't make it to the house across the street that I'd LOVE to see! We did get to see all the baby goats though!There is a ton to see here, but make sure you give yourself enough time. I'd go when they open so the kids are a bit more ready for a tour. I wish this were a bit more self guided so we could still see everything but go at our own speedy pace. Our docent while doing his best, wasn't really picking up on the cues that we needed the speedy tour. But if you're adults only, you'll love this! I hope to get back there!You can make a decent day trip out this way from LA. Look up what else is around. There are some cool historic restaurants, other museums, and King Richard's Antique Center, which is supposedly the largest in CA!",Michael T

50,"Junk or Museum, Worth Seeing","I don't know how this museum keeps its doors open It has limited hours and is free, yet covers many acres with buildings and old equipment. After the volunteer spent an hour telling us the interesting and complex history of the area, he showed us the working vintage machine shop, several buildings filled with old farming and petroleum equipment, vehicles, tractors, old oil tanks, preserved gas stations, and on and on. We would have liked another hour to explore all this. It seems the Hathaways never threw away anything and it's all still here for display.The Hathaway family started ranching and then added the petroleum business. Somewhere along the story, the surname of Bell came into the story and lead to the surrounding communities of Bell, Bell Gardens (where the garden had been), Bellflower (where the flowers had been) and even far away Bel Air (high in the hills with fresh air). Norwalk is along the trail the Tongva used to walk north. We hope to go back someday and finish the tour.",Kenneth L
