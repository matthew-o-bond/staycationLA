50,Vast variety every second Sunday of the month,"Taking the Gold Line from Downtown to Memorial Park left us with a pleasant early morning walk to the Stadium. Arriving around 9am it was already busy but entry queues moved quickly.Itâ€™s a vast event with stalls everywhere with a multitude of items on offer. One of the most fascinating was a collection of Edison Wax Cylinder and Victor Phonographs, all shiny and in working order. For the former we asked the chap to play a wax cylinder and sure enough the music was evocatively from a far away time.An impressive looking entertainer in a kilt was passionately playing a stringed instrument and his performance garnered numerous dollars.Many cafes and food stalls are in place and we adjourned to one mid-morning for a pick-me-up.",permia
40,Massive Flea Market in Southern California.,"Staged on the second Sunday of each month. Parking is free but involves a little walk to the entrance. Admission costs vary with time of arrival. I paid $9 when I showed up at 9am. Items for sale are arranged in areas; Antiques & Collectibles, New Merchandise, Arts and Crafts and Vintage and General. If you want to cover all the stalls it involves a lot of walking. My overall impression is that compared to European Flea markets and others in the US, the JUNK quotient is 90% and the prices are high. So this is a fun one time only experience.",Timothy C
40,Fun time at the flea market,This is the first time I visited the flea market and I am glad I visitedThere are a lot of interesting items for home and giftsWhen you come - make sure you have sunscreen and a hat. Wear tennis shoes because there is a lot of ground to cover.No vegan friendly food choices so if you are vegan - make sure you bring your snacksI do plan to return next month for holiday gift shopping and I will make sure I bring a cart with wheels.,Lourdes Maria C
30,Great market with some room to improve.,"We visited the Rose Bowl Flea Market and have to say the market is huge with so much variety, definitely something for everyone. However we were a little surprised by the relatively high entrance price and somewhat disappointed with the availability and price of food and drinks.",-Guzzis-are-ace-
