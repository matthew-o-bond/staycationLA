40,Manhattan Beach Pier is the best of the others in the local area.,"I visited all 3 Beach Piers in this area today (10th June 2018) and Manhattan Beach Pier, and Manhattan Beach in general, was by far the best one. It had a much nicer vibe to it and the beach and town were also much nicer. The aquarium on the end of the pier is under construction and so it was closed off when I visited but the pier is still a nice place to take a walk and to sit on one of the benches provided and take in the sea vista's. The only downside of Manhattan Beach was the difficulty with car parking... At one point I nearly gave up and left after trying for 30+ minutes to get a space, but one did become free and so I stayed and I'm glad I did as Manhattan Beach and the Pier is worth a visit for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
40,I love piers!!,"I can't help it! I simply love, love piers! We had a long layover at LAX and decided to Uber over to a nearby pier to spend some time, eat a good meal, and quite frankly - just get out of the airport! We visited on a Wednesday at midday. Not during a holiday so traffic wasn't really out of the norm. I chose this pier because of close proximity to the airport, the traffic was heavier north of the airport and besides we had already been to the Santa Monica Pier a few years ago. This pier was peaceful. The waves we good and so the surfers were out there enjoying the waves they could ride! Lots of food choices nearby so you won't starve. We made it back to the airport with plenty of time to spare. Traffic both ways about 30 mins each. Uber ride about $10 each way. Memories priceless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenapardue1234

My family and I had Easter Brunch at The Strand on our last day visiting our older son and daughter-in-law in Los Angeles. The food was delicious and their chicken and waffles are the best my husband has ever had. It's the Vermont syrup that they serve with the dish. It's magnificent.

50,Manhattan Beach is a smoke free city and that includes the pier.,"Was at the pier one night in September just before sundown. There are signs that state the city law that prohibits smoking in the city and even on the pier. At the far end of the pier was someone smoking. This pier is just a plain pier, with only the little aquarium at the far end. What could've been a nice quiet sunset walk out over the water was spoiled by this inconsiderate smoker.It was too late to see the aquarium as it has limited hours.Smokers take note and non-smokers rejoice:The City of Manhattan Beach only allows smoking in private homes, certain hotel rooms, and in moving cars.SMOKING IS PROHIBITED in ALL public places and that includes ALL outdoor areas such as outside of buildings, sidewalks, streets, open spaces, the beach, pier etc.The City of Hermosa Beach, next door to the south, also has a strict ban on public smoking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NativeAngelena

50,A Favorite Place,"The Manhattan Beach Pier is a wonder place to take a leisurely stroll. At the end of the pier there is a beach cafe with a variety of tasty and reasonably priced snacks, coffee and water. On some evenings during seasonal times of the year, the pier is aligned with strands of soft white lights from its beginning to end and it really makes the pier a beautiful and magical place. Surrounding the pier are miles of beautiful beach. As a surfer, I can appreciate the waves of Manhattan beach. I also love the Manhattan Beach area bike path. I usually do the ride from Hermosa to Rancho Palos Verdes and it has its own allure...but, the strip of path at Manhattan allows for the best rest stopping to people-watch. More about the actual pier is that it has benches on either side where visitors can stop to take in the scenery, read a book, listen to music on their earpods, or cuddle up with a loved one. The pier is a great place for families and for people from all walks of life. Metered parking is available just North of the bike path on either side of Manhattan Beach Blvd. The meters offer about 4 hours maximum time and visitors can pay via credit or debit card for their convenience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokce

It was gorgeous at sunset when I was there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooken498
50,Watched SpaceX PAZ launch from Vandenberg from the Pier.,"I'm not sure what I would do if this landmark ever vanished. It's something I love so much, but take for granted it will always be the same when I return home to Manhattan Beach. It's a great place to walk out on and take in what Los Angeles is all about. There's not a lot to it, so it allows you to soak in the surroundings and really connect with the ocean, beach and true character of Manhattan Beach. There's a small snack stand at the end called the ""Round House"" that also has a tiny marine museum that's fun to take kids through. Entry is free but a small donation is suggested to help pay for maintaining the exhibit. Bring a light jacket, camera, binoculars and someone to snuggle. Good experience at any time of day or night and a must see if you are visiting Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/947gregt

30,Dolphins!,"I am giving this 3 stars because the end of pier was closed so we didn't get the full view. Also, there are a lot of fisher-people that hog up the rail, so it is hard to get close.

The familiar roundhouse at the end of the pier, the waves coming in to give the surfers their needed excitement, and the families that enjoyed the sand, gave a sense of calm and tranquility.Joggers and bikers gave life to the path allotted to them.

The beach is close enough to the airport to get there in very small amount of time. I wasn't familiar with the bus system, so I took an Uber. Word of advice: if you are taking an Uber, be sure to walk out of LAX airport a little ways and set your pickup destination elsewhere, otherwise, they will charge you exorbitant fees and you can save money just from walking half a mile away.Great neighborhood, lots of things to do and the beach is a great place to swim. The pier is a really charming place and it was great to watch the sunset over the ocean. Check out the ice cream shop nearby and avoid the pizza place.

There are fish of many varieties in tanks but the labelling is poor making identification difficult.There is a rock pool at the entrance where a volunteer named Dave gave us a talk on the various starfish and other creatures it contained.

40,Nice views,Came here at night and had a walk along the pier so I don't think I could truly appreciate the surrounding views but it was nice to see the lights and sea around the coastline in the evening but would probably recommend others to go in the daytime as there isn't really much to do around here at night apart from bars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543joh
50,Cool pier to watch the sunset,"Beautiful pier, great sunset, cool breezy nights in early October. It is a little difficult to park for the beach/pier (there are small lots and everywhere else is meters from 24-minutes to 2 hours).Enjoyed our visit and would love to return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiffanyjim
40,Cool Pier Over the Pacific!,"Not much to see here but there was a sign that discussed the history of the pier. There was a snack shop in the building located at the end of the pier. Also a small aquarium was housed in the same building. The people that ran the place were at lunch, maybe, when i visited so i am not sure if it was free or by donation (no signs). There is a small bathroom in the same building. Many surfers were near the pier so it was cool to watch them rides the waves. overall worth walking out the end of the pier. Easily completed in 15 minutes which would include talking to the fishermen and taking pictures off of the pier. If you do neither of these you can be finished within 10 minutes. There is no shade so it gets hot on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7823URdanh
40,Nice day at the pier,"It's a cool place to visit when you are around LA. There is a Starbucks near the pier so you can grab a coffee and walk to the pier, sit there and enjoy the sun.

People watching at it's best.....a lot of fishermen at the end who are willing to show their catch and tell you how they catch their meals!

50,Enjoy a Sunset,"While there are a number of piers in a row along the coast, the MB pier is one of the best.

50,Lovely walk,We loved the quaint feel of our trip to this pier . It felt like going back to the 1950's .

50,Beach Day,"I was with a 15 year old and we had a wonderful day at the beach, brought our cooler, blanket and towels.There were restrooms nearby, the beach was nice. We picked a quieter side and enjoyed our whole day. Afterwards we went to walk the pier and check out the aquarium at the end. We saw really cool sea creatures like sharks, sea horses and eels. It was a $2.00 donation and worth it. We took lovely pictures on the pier. There was a cafe on the pier as well but we didn't go to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/69dawni

50,One of the cleanest and safest piers in South Bay,"Good place to just walk, people watch, and enjoy the incredible fresh ocean air. It is clean and has a nice little aquarium at the ocean end. Children like it. Parking is convenient unless there is a special event and it is close to the Manhattan Beach shopping and restaurant district. Lots of beautiful seaside homes to view. Not a big tourist trap like the Santa Monica Pier. Simple and relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOCGAC
30,Round house fun for little ones,"Area has changed immensely in 15 years.. You cannot believe you are in this country when strolling the pier on a summer weekend evening.. peopleFrom every imaginable country speaking many languages, all ages.. Really amazing actually.

Our kids did story times there and they even do sleep over bday parties ..how fun! Snack bar area has expanded although we have never eaten there and there is a restroom open sometimes.

50,Great place to get some exercise,"I love walking along The Strand. The bike/rollerblading path is separate from the walking path, so you don't need to worry about getting hurt. The path goes for a few miles so if you are jogging, walking, or biking you can get a good work out in. Also it isn't ridiculously crowded. If you get hungry or thirsty you can always visit one of the restaurants near the pier for a refresher. There is beautiful landscaping, its so picturesque. Just go and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amykowal

50,gorgeous,The pier adds to the already beautiful backdrop of this beach. It offers breathtaking views and warm nights,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62Dave1313
50,The oldest concrete standing pier on the West Coast,"The history of the current pier goes back to 1920 and has seen numerous repairs, rebuilds, and renovations due to Mother Nature. However, predecessor piers (wooden and iron) go back to the turn of the 20th century. The 928 foot long pier is at the end of Manhattan Beach Blvd. An octagon-shaped building is located at the end of the pier and houses a small aquarium. I've been to a few places over the years, and the positive vibe one feels standing on the pier and looking all around is very nice. In fact, the entire Manhattan Beach shoreline area is a wonderful place to relax and stare at the ocean, beach, and mountains. You may have even seen the pier in old movies such Tequila Sunrise, Starsky & Hutch, and Point Break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keystone_Traveler

40,In the heart of the action,"Manhattan Beach Pier is an iconic pier. It is probably the best place to people watch- including surfers giving it a go in the surf and those in activities in the beach.At the end of the pier there is a small cafe and an aquarium. There is not a lot to the aquarium, yet it is about the perfect size and interaction level for small children.From the end of the pier you have a great view of the beach and the homes that crowd along the shoreline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbc421
40,Iconic Landmark.,"When I think about Manhattan Beach, the Pier and the strand are always great spots to enjoy the views of the beautiful beaches, waves and people enjoying the outdoors. You don't even have to step onto the pier to enjoy it. It is beautiful at sunset. There are people fishing off it, visiting the marine life center at the end of the pier or just strolling enjoying the views. It is free to walk on but I am unsure about fees for the little marine center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdfromPDR
40,Iconic landmark,"A wonderful place for a leisurely stroll out beyond the surf line. Take in the monument stones to Manhattan Open Volleyball champs, visit the Roundhouse at the end of the pier, or just sit and enjoy the view.

Bet you didn't know it was originally built with an extension beyond the Roundhouse!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAWH77
50,Quintessential Southern California stroll,"If you are visiting the Los Angeles region a stroll on the strand in Manhattan Beach and down the pier to watch the surfers is a great way to get a feel for life in sunny SoCal. There is a coffee shop and tiny but interesting aquarium at the end of the pier and great view of the bay and surfers of all ages. Girls playing volleyball on the beach in their thong bikinis are a big hit with the guys but I prefer to watch surfers catch the waves from out at the end of the pier. There are bathroom facilities, changing room and showers and straight up the hill from the pier is the beach village with heaps of restaurants, coffee shops and clothing shops. Manhattan Creamery is a big hit but if the line is long check out the gelato place just up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorif590
40,Lovely!!,"My daughter enjoyed our walk here despite the crowd. It can get crowded but it just adds a certain feel to the place. It is scenic and filled with life (people just hanging out- families, friends, pets, etc). People from all walks of life converge here and just enjoy the scenery and the beach. We did not swim but it did look inviting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneAdmana
40,Volley ball and surfing in one,Want to see surfers play in he water? It happens here regularly at this Southern California city of Manhattan Beach.

One could sit around and watch a volleyball game on or tournaments in the summer.The Manhattan Beach tournament is the place to be at in the summer.This is a good place to get a birds eye view of surfers and the beach area. It's all fun in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mscanastra

40,Nice walk with great views,"The view was beautiful as one would expect but I really enjoyed how low the pier was as it enabled us to have a close up view of the surfers. There was some excitement with people catching fish which was fun and a very small aquarium with a large ""eel"", more like a few fish tanks for a little entertainment. Would have liked a restaurant on the pier but we enjoyed a scenic and entertaining walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuevas210
50,Beautiful beach and shopping area!,"We had a little time to kill between our cruise and flight out. Took an uber from the airport to the pier. It was only $15 one way for 3-4 people.

30,Easy walk from Manhattan Beach,We took a morning stroll from the shopping centre of Manhattan Beach down to the pier and quite enjoyed the walk. The pier itself was not very busy and the aquarium at the end was closed so we wandered down to the end and then came straight back. It is a very good spot to view the surfers and the beach but there is little else to do. Worth just a short visit only. The pier itself is rather dilapidated and tired in need of a good coat of paint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennyhall1944

30,Take a stroll to watch the surfers and sandy veaches,"Manhattan Beach Pier is a wide long concrete pier which offers a great view of the surfers, beach volley ball and the wide sandy beaches.

50,LAX layover option,"Visited the beach in the late afternoon before a late night flight to Australia. Great place to swim/surf, or just hangout on the pier. Lots of eating and drinking options close by and the pier has an aquarium.

The water was so clear that even out at the end of the pier, I could see the ocean floor. The pier was decorated for Christmas, but I didn't wait around to see everything lit up. I did, however, take the opportunity to walk out to the aquarium (review to follow). If you enjoy people watching, this is the place to do it. There were people from all over the place out today.

40,Great family outing!,"Great family outing! This summer instead of traveling far i decided to visit the beaches around me. Manhattan is now one of my favorites for family time. Its clean from trash, although there is quite a bit of sea weed. the shower areas are big and clean as well and the water was surprisingly warm. Parking was also good they have various spaces and all are quarter or card operated. At night once the lights come on around the pier and the streets it gives quite a romantic view. My daughter of 11 and 16 loved it we spent hours in and out of the water with her boogie board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vulcanlore

50,A beautiful place,While visiting here in Los Angeles our host took us to Manhatten beach for a walk and we ended up walking down to the pier which was beautiful. At the very end of the pier was a small aquarium that had starfish and other sea life from the local pacific ocean. The pier and the aquarium were free which is nice when you are traveling on a budget. We walked on the Strand which is the walkers and joggers path along Manhatten beach which was lined with gigantic and beautiful mansons. Very humbling for a carpenter from florida. A very lovely walk filled with beautiful sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dw4545

40,The most romantic pier for a stroll,"The MB pier is by far the most romantic of all three piers in the south bay. The Round House at the end, and the quietness of the surroundings give it an edge over Hermosa Beach. The Redondo Pier is just a carnival.I recommend setting the dinner reservation and then taking a walk to the end of the pier and back, or topping off the night with a late night stroll. The look back from the end of the pier is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel
40,Good fishing & Nice Views,"Like the beach, the pier is pretty laid back without much going on. There's a (very) small aquarium on the pier and that's about it. If you're looking a for a quiet spot to relax and/or fish - this is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tzajch

It was fun to walk on the beach and watch the surfers ride the waves.The waves were crashing onto the piers by the end of the afternoon. Awesome.I would suggest wearing old shoes or water socks as we got some spots of tar on our feet and had to really scrub when we got back to the hotel in order to remove it.It was a nice afternoon and very relaxing.

50,Take a leisurely walk with beautiful views and many shops and restaurants,"Los Angeles has so many beaches all with their own personality. Manhattan Beach is a very classy Beach. Rich professionals and athletes make this area their home. It is not a Venice-style beach with street performers and Hippy chaos. It is sophisticated and clean, at the bottom of a sloped street. The shops are expensive, but you will find beauty shops and spas, sports accessories, flwers, delicious food, bicycles and many pedestrians (not many skate-boarders). Add this to your coastal bike trip and get to know this classy section of the LA beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624

40,"Great stroll any time, day or night","While there are several piers to choose from in the LA area, the MB pier is one of my favorites: calmer and less touristy than Santa Monica, but with a bustling town behind you. The scenery is what makes this pier a rather picturesque place to enjoy the sights and smells of the sea. There is a small aquarium at the end of the pier, as well as a concession stand, but I've only ever been when these have been closed.It's quite family friendly, but you can also find quieter moments to enjoy the sunrise or sunset alone or with a significant other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elogibs

30,Cool vista to watch the surfers,"Not terribly distinctive as piers go, however, if there are surfers in the water, its cool to be over the water and see the waves from the surfers viewpoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haynesjen

40,Touch tank,"Visited the pet and went to the aquarium. It's small and run by volunteers, but it gives kids a reason to walk to the end. The starfish touch tank was fun for the kids.

50,nice beach for a long walk,I like walking on sand so it is obvious that i have enjoyed in that beach so much.

40,A nice long pier with an aquarium at the end,"Walking the pier allows one to look back to the beach, the volleyball nets, the bike path, and the mansions that line the strand. As well as the town that goes up the hill from the waters edge. You're also out on the water as it's a long pier. There is the aquarium at the end that the city describes this way, ""This free aquarium sits at the end of Manhattan Beach Pier & is host to classes, parties & camps"" It's worth the time to walk out and take a look. Both at the aquarium and back to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/391waynew
50,Include the per in your plans to visit,"When you walk the pier, you are out among the local surfers and you have a great opportunity to watch them in action- great photo ops.

50,Beautiful sunrise!,"Our flight got in at 6am on a Friday and we were driving to San Diego but wanted to skip traffic so we came to Manhattan Beach which is a very short drive from the rental car area by LAX, about 6 miles.

40,Perfect Afternoon!,"My mother and I flew into LAX for an event the next day and were looking for something low-key to do on Friday afternoon. Being from the Atlantic Coast, we wanted to see the Pacific Ocean. Manhattan Beach was the most convenient to where we were staying. It was a little tricky navigating to it on the busy streets, but we were happy to find a public parking lot with handicapped parking (metered). The coast is lined with interesting, attractive private residences and condos, not chain hotels. You can access a nice bike path that goes miles along the shore. The beach was beautiful; wide and clean. It was 75 degrees and a clear, sunny day so there were some people there sunbathing, surfing, wading, and playing volleyball but it was not crowded. We walked out on the pier and enjoyed the scenery, watched the gulls and pelicans. The pier has plaques in the sidewalk recognizing volleyball players from the area. The Roundhouse Aquarium at the end of the pier was open (3pm-sunset weekdays, 10am-sunset weekends), so we stopped in to look at the sea life and pet a starfish. You can also fish from the pier. There's a concession stand (no tables) on the pier called Manhattan Beach Yacht Club with gourmet coffee, hot chocolate, smoothies, juice and ice cream sandwiches. Depending on what you like to do and what you have time for, you can spend an hour just strolling on the pier, or an entire day enjoying the beach and exploring the shops and restaurants. Free except for parking meters, optional voluntary donation for aquarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
20,"Disappointed, stick to Redondo Beach/Pier","This beach/pier is just okay, nothing great.

50,What better waste of time?,"We had a few hours to kill before our flight home, and had been recommended Manhattan Beach & pier as a place to visit, as it wasn't far from our hotel.We had been to Santa Monica the previous day, so this made a relaxing change from the hustle and bustle that we saw there.It wasn't totally deserted, but there were fewer people on the pier than we'd expected.The pier was a great viewpoint for people watching; the surf was great too so we spent a while watching the surfers.There's a little aquarium at the end of the pier, but we didn't visit it.It was a great place to sit and relax and watch the world go by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHolders

40,Classic California Views,"Always worth a stroll toward sunset to see the often spectacular sunsets over the Pacific. Earlier in the day you can catch surfers and sometimes volley ball games right along the beach below the pier. On a clear day you can see from Palos Verdes all around Santa Monica Bay to Malibu. The round house at the end of the pier houses a small aquarium that is perfect for children. And at the end of the pier is the main street of Manhattan Beach with its numerous shops, restaurants, and bars.

50,Great pier for photography,"We went to many piers during our California trip, but this one ranked near the top. I think it was a combination of the neighborhood that you walk through to get to the pier, along with the views from the pier. Looking back towards Manhattan was amazing to see how all the houses were stacked right on top of each other row after row up the hill. The architecture was breathtaking on many of the houses. There were a few surfers in the water but nowhere near as many as other piers we visited. The waves were really crashing into the pier the day we were there. This pier didn't have the same souvenir shops or amusement park feel as others. It was just a peaceful pier for listening to the waves crash in and taking pictures.I do have a warning though! The hill getting to and from the pier is an extremely steep incline. We parked at the top in a parallel spot that was metered. After walking down the hill to the pier, then to the end of the pier, and then heading back up the hill....we were both feeling the burn in our legs! And we are both pretty active so our legs are accustomed to walking. But that hill will get ya! It's worth it though and I wouldn't hesitate to climb it again if we are back in California again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick

40,Must see in Manhattan Beach,"We spent several hours on a Saturday morning in November at the Manhattan Beach Pier. There was plenty of parking available, but we chose to park a couple blocks south to enjoy the walk. The pier was a highlight of our trip to LA for my 13 year old Minnesotan son. A lot of intestine sights, from birds to surfers to watercraft to magicians. I was surprised that the park and Aquarium didn't open until 11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yami_13
30,Nice pier,"Nice place for a walk (also a good place to spot dolphins), but not as nice as the Santa Monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariebeukenoot
40,Nice place to watch the surf and the surfers,"After a great lunch at Brewco, we wandered down to pier enjoy some of the warm California sun (yes it was actually out). It was a short walk to the end of the pier where refreshments were sold. On our walk back, we stopped to watch the surfers ride the waves next to and around the pier. If you are at Manhattan Beach, you have to walk to pier to get the local feel of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scuba-Duner

Stay for and watch the Sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
50,Walk the Pier; it's the Best Way to Appreciate the Entire Area,"The pier is your ring-side view to see what Manhattan Beach village and the beach itself is all about. We walked out on the pier just before sunset and it was quite entertaining. Fisherman trying their best, families visiting the little aquarium at the end of the pier, and coffee drinkers enjoying a brew from the little caf√©. Then we turned around to face the shore and enjoyed the panoramic view of the beach from the power plant on the left way down as far as you could see to the right. I love the way the land slopes to the beach and how people figured out ways to build their bungalows to fit the limited space available. The beach was being enjoyed by families, boogie boarders and a couple surfers. What a pleasant place with a strong feel of community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casaflamingo
50,Terrific to walk and people watch - parking tip below,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Manhattan Beach Pier. We also learned our lesson about parking this visit, which we suffered through last visit.Park at the public parking lot across from Sushi Fusion near Manhattan Beach Blvd. All spaces are metered, and there were available spaces, and it was hassle-free. Avoid driving, searching for parking. Just park, walk, and GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee
50,Loved watching the Surfers!,This pier is a combination fishing pier as well as a terrific location to view the lovely shore and coastline of Manhattan Beach.

50,Interesting part of history,"A very pleasant walk on this pier included a visit to the tiny free aquarium in the roundhouse at the end of the pier. Originally built between 1917 and 1920 the pier's roundhouse at the end was added to buffer the pier from the pounding surf. It is Southern California's oldest example of early reinforced concrete pier construction. Besides all that, it is simply a nice place to take a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ingrid4711
50,Breath taking,"An amazing beach that I came to visit on a hot day. It has a great vibe, with clean sand. The overall cleanliness of the beach is fantastic, the city made sure trash cans and recycling bins are easy to locate. The bathrooms are also fairly big so there isn't a long line to go in.California beaches are just beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovehappyl
50,Beautiful spot,"A great spot to watch the sun set, watch the waves or just take a few minutes to regroup between catching the waves in the surf. Just be aware, if the beach patrol is active; jet skis, helicopter, land patrol, and some occasional activity, they might be looking for a shark as they were the day I was there. A friendly firefighter suggested I refrain from swimming too far out and explained the reason for the air cover and activity level. I did not see the shark but I did move down the beach as suggested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EZGoingTraveler10001
40,Perfect Day,"We had the perfect beach day at the pier. It is very convenient to restaurants and shopping and there is meeting parking along the street.

50,Get closer to the water and watch the surfers,"Manhattan Beach is a beautiful spot and the pier just makes it easier to spend time watching the waves (and the surfers), hang out near the fishermen, listen to a random musician, paint a picture, take a great photo and get the wonderful perspective of looking back at land and the coast line.It is stroller and wheelchair accessible. Get yourself some saltwater breezes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5545KHamym
50,Classic California Pier,"This is a fantastic pier to visit. The aquarium was closed but I was able to watch a most spectacular sunset here. Folks are very friendly, the area is safe and the vibe is mellow. A must see when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/watchman01
50,I love this place,"Manhattan Beach is simply magical ... maybe not ""exotic"", but there's something special about this place. The Pier is a focal point of town, and a must do for locals all the time, and for visitors, it's fun, cool, romantic, just an all around wonderful place. Summary: Go there, ""be"" there! Word!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/147frankm
50,Fun Place,We just walked around and visited the local places. We had so much fun going in and out of the shops and restaurants. Great place to take the family or enjoy a romantic walk around town and to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411connieh

40,Great look out for families!,"Dolphins, surfers, sailboats, Navy Battle ships, barges. If it floats its there. If you have little boys they will go crazy for this pier. A decent walk to the end for kids but you wont worry about them falling in or anything of that nature. The city has made every effort to keep that pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622shawnw
40,It's a nice stroll,"Good way to watch the waves, and surfers, roll in. At the end there is a small aquarium/museum that will hold your attention for a few minutes.

50,Top Destination,One of my favorite places on earth. Manhattan Beach Pier gives a unique view to The Strand and all of the multi-million dollar beach homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SinCityExaminer
40,really nice after sunset,"after spending the whole afternoon in the water till the sunset, we checked the pier out.not as flashy as the piers in newport beach or santa monica beach, but it is still okvery few people, rather quite, no bustle of fishermen, unlike the pier at newport beach.the street leading up to the pier has lots happening, probably the best place to enjoy your last night in LA thanks to the serenity.there is a food outlet all the way down the pier, they stop hot food at sundown and close shortly after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fahym
50,Always serene....pleasant,"I've always liked this part of California's beaches. While it has few seashells (that disappoints me), it is a nice, moderately busy pier and beach. This particular time, the waves were higher than normal due to 'weather' elsewhere. That certainly drew out a massive amount of surfers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandip950
50,Great Eats & Shops,"2 hours parking max means lots of movement in parking spaces. Beach parking of 5 hr max is more difficult to get, but there are hidden locations that locals use (ask concierge). If you are staying close by its better to Uber or catch a taxi. Perfect SoCal beach community - like what you expect from TV. Oh it is Cali, so also expect to pay $$$$ for higher quality food. But there is also $ options of Subway and other lower price places. But you get what you pay for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897mimie
50,Such An Amazing Location!,"I live in Los Angeles and though we have several Piers to visit, I always go for The Manhattan Beach Pier. I love the environment, the people, local shops and restaurants. I can go on and on about this place, but I'll share my photography experience. If you are interested in photography. The Manhattan Beach Pier a great spot to photography sunsets. During the summer the sun will set behind the Pier giving it this magnificent shades of orange and red hues. It's amazing. I highly recommend this location. I few things to keep in mind. Make sure you don't park in the street, unless you want to keep coming back to your car and feed the parking meeter. You will find public parking, where you can pay for a full day. It's a bit challenging to find parking, so you'll need a little bit of patience. All in all, it's totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144JamesR
50,"Nice, clean beach","Clean beach with great waves for surfing, body surfing, swimming. Volleyball galore. Walked the strand by night, body surfed by day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeSmurfy

50,Nice pier on nice beach in great area,"The Santa Monica bike path runs right past the Manhattan Beach pier making it a great rest stop on the route from Santa Monica to Redondo Beach. Great surfing and lots of volleyball gets played in and around the pier. If you take a short walk up the hill, you will find a variety of restaurants and shopping in Manhattan Beach. They even have a parking lot at the base of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
40,Nice place to watch the surfers,"As many reviewers have said, it's not Santa Monica and there isn't much to do on the pier, but sometimes all you need is a nice place to sit with a cool breeze. This is that place.Grab your coffee up the street, head down to the pier and grab a seat on one of the many benches. Kick back and watch the surfers ride the waves in.Not a bad way to start your Saturday morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sighos999
30,"Nice walk, but little else","Manhattan Beach pier is a wonderful walking area and always a pleasure to stroll and sit to look at the wonderful ocean below. However, there is little else so don't go there thinking you're going to have a lot to do. If you're fine with the stroll and stopping for coffee, then it's a great find. There are numerous restaurants located near the pier, but the pier itself has only a small coffee shop at the end. Too bad, because it certainly seems like it would be an idea place for a great restaurant. There's a small section called the Roundhouse that houses some fish and ocean artifacts. I wouldn't call it a museum and the tanks are so filthy you can't really see what's in them. Again, it is too bad because it could be a wonderful spot, but it is in serious need of clean up and renovation. I believe I read the City of Manhattan Beach may be upgrading the end of the pier and I hope it's true because it could be a much more inviting spot. Regardless, take a stroll down the pier's length on a nice day; it's worth the trip just to be on the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CABeachTraveler
30,The pier,"As a young family I would not rush to walk the pier. It looks great from the pathway or the beach, but we visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty manic. Our 20 month old was pretty lost and our 5 year old got a bit bored once her ice cream was done. I would recommend a stroll along the coastal footpath above a walk along the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22willb
50,Great view,Loved the view from the pier. Beach Is beautiful never knew so many people fish on the pier. The further you go out on the pier the more fishing poles you see. Personally I sat down on the benches and just enjoyed the view!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelJunkie702
40,Cool!,"Loved this pier, parking SUCKS though. The only downside was the big pollution stacks you have to look at to the left and right of the pier....it ruins pictures, and the looks of the coastline. But there was a cute aquarium at the end of the pier with starfish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/datagram314
50,I'm so lucky to have this picturesque pier right in my neighborhood.,"I have to say....of all the neighborhoods in this general area of Los Angeles, I could not be happier living where I do in Manhattan Beach. Fantastic area, beautiful, relatively safe & clean. How happy it makes me to be able to walk straight down the hill and be in Downtown Manhattan Beach. A few steps further is The Strand where I can walk or ride my bicycle with my furry best friend for miles and miles and just beyond that is the soft white sand and the gorgeous Manhattan Beach Pier. The roundhouse at the foot of the pier is quite beautiful I must say. The whole area has a European-seaside village feel to it. Boutiques, restaurants, people with their families, dogs, friends and loved ones. The massive beach ""cottages"" and the ice plant-covered hillsides. Just gorgeous! It's such a sensational area to spend time.I love walking on the pier and watching the waves, the surfers, looking for the happy playful dolphins, smelling that incredible salty sea mist in the air. Looking south to Hermosa, Redondo and Palos Verdes in the distance and looking north to El Segundo and Marina del Rey. Just for fun, be sure to visit the small but very cool aquarium inside. You can even grab a hot chocolate to keep you warm on those chilly nights at the beach. I love my Manhattan Beach Pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
30,Meh. Very nice beach and are! Pier was perhaps quieter than normal,"Walked the area. Nice visit, clean beach. Pier was a 15 minute stroll. Pleasant, nice breeze.

40,Pretty,The pier provides a beautiful and relaxing walk over the ocean. There is a small aquarium at the end which my kids really enjoyed. We also spent some time just sitting on a bench eating ice cream and watching the surfers and fishermen. It's beautiful in the evening too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrissy0176
50,Peaceful Pier,"Unlike other piers, this one is actually quite peaceful and quiet. Many people fished there and you can just sit down at the end of the pier enjoying the calmness of the sea and the breeze.Overall, if you want a pier to relax and you don't enjoy crowded place with lots of shops and restaurants on the pier, I would highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radiikal
40,Nice Pier,"Clean pier with water and fish cleaning available near the end of the pier. There is a small cafe and aquarium near the end of the pier. It wasn't too crowded and fishing was below average on the day I went. I did see a small pod of porpoise, but no great whites! The only con was the local police were writting tickets to any bicyclists that rode there bikes rather than pushing them across infront of the pier. I guess it is a safety hazard, but come on!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y705YZbrians

50,"Nice views, very nice marine exhibit","Having crawled all over this thing (and jumped off) and fished from it since I was two years old, this fixture is like the back of my hand.And still a very nice place to walk out on & check out the beach scenery or have a fish. You'll notice people actually slow down and stroll on it rather than marching or going at a fast pace. Even runners generally avoid being nongs and running around the thing.Many years back they installed a marine museum and aquarium at the seaward end of rye roundhouse and it's fantastic! You sort of wonder about how these things could going such a small space, but it's excellent and highly recommended. Even a petting/touching tank.Would avoid the pier area when there any of the increasing numbers of sponsored ""festivals"" or tournaments. These used to be rather low key affairs one could stroll down to and through. They are now huge multimedia flashy fashion show events absolutely jammed like sardines and most often roped or fenced off. If you're into that, there you go. If you're not, avoid at call costs, although I should note the events are on the beach next to the pier, not on the pier. So the pier itself is generally uncrowded and OK. You're just next to a fluoro-circus.The pier. What can I say? A cool thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tryne

Cab drivers where nice and always took the short way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3802HCdavidw
20,Underwhelming,It's an old pier that juts out into the Pacific Ocean. It has numerous warning signs about what you cannot do there and a tacky aquarium at the end. You can buy some snacks and food. It might be fun during a storm. You can look back at how the coastal people live in cave dwelling fashion on the shore. Don't go out of your way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EventGuyChicago

Didn't really get in..many volleyball nets if you want to play a game.. nice just to watch the surf and chill. There is a mini aquarium at the end of the pier but really not much to it...a bit sad really..a few tanks.. dirty water..needs an overhaul.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoosier63

50,Great Pier - Upscale Shopping/Dining Area,"Manhattan Beach Pier is different than the Santa Monica Pier. It's really just a pier, but has celebrated its 100th year. Still, it's fun for anyone from a landlocked state to visit a pier. This one does have many great restaurants and stores for shopping nearby. The area is really upscale and the local shops were super. Several national stores, boutiques were located within walking distance of the pier, up the hill. Be prepared to handle steep walking. Parking may be a little tricky and the town keeps an eye on the parking meters. There are limits on the length of time for parking and moving your vehicle may be necessary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA

40,Great view of expansive beach and ocean,"The pier is about in the middle of the attractive wide beach. It has a small aquarium and snack bar at the end.

50,I live nearby and have lived in the area off and on since 1975,"It isn't the Muscle Beach as in the Frankie Avalon movies = it used to be because I remember the way it was when I was a little girl. It still has the rings, parallel bars, and mat areas where on any given day you will see people working out, but not 'Muscle Man' events as it used to be. It's still and interesting place with lots of colorful characters, restaurants, and the pier is nearby as is Marina Del Rey. There is bike and roller blade rentals and the bike path too.

There isn't one on the Pier.We went to the cafe on the Pier and had a chat with the man working, he was quite informative about the area. He also had good food but it's fast food.

30,View from the Pier,"Well worth the walk to view up and down Manhatten Beach. While very busy, the Pier also a great place to share a pizza on a sunny day. Disappointed that the 'cafe' on the Pier wasn't very appealing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonnieNZ

30,Typical Pier,"We went to the pier on a Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. during peak vacation season. Pier and beach was filled with many people. Parking was very difficult to come by. There are people fishing on the end of the pier, and there is a small aquarium for visitors. There is also a mens and womens bathroom at the pier. The cafe at the pier serves hot dogs, chips, drinks and pretzels.There aren't people selling items at the pier, which is nice. The view of the factories to the left and right of the pier were concerning to an out of town guest such as myself, as I wanted to know why they were there. Otherwise, it was an interesting place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasBling

50,Never get tired of it,"I feel lucky to live close by, and I never tire of the sunsets. Early morning and evenings are the best; the beach never gets super-crowded except perhaps during the summer months. The beach is generally clean, and the pier is a great place to watch the surfers and waves. There is a small aquarium with touch tank that my kids enjoy (free; donations suggested).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAWorkingMom
30,Manhattan Beach pier average,There isn't much to do at this pier. A small aquariam is featured at the end but that takes all of 5 minutes to see. Of course there is a great view of the ocean and the beach but that can be seen from the beach too. All in all I wouldn't go out of my way to walk the pier it's nothing exciting. Redondo pier has a lot going on and Hermosa has all the bars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phamus

40,Ck out the ice cream....,Just a few blocks in from the pier there is a cute ice cream parlor. The pier and beach are nice but there is a steep climb from the beach to parking on the side streets. Be prepared for a bit of a hike. Also The Kettle restaurant has good food but the service is average and had limited menu knowledge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Electrichic

50,"Pleasent Walk, Great View of the Coastline",A very nice walk over the Pacific. The view gives you a better perspective of what the beach side of Manhattan Beach really looks like. This pier was the only pier to survive intact the vicious storm of 1983. The pier has a small but nice salt water Aquarium in the round house at the end of the pier. The fee is only a small donation and well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polarbearx

50,One of the Best Places to Visit and/or Live Near in Southern California,"When I first moved to California, I lived just a few blocks from this beach, and spent many weekends swimming, diving, and surfing near this pier and walking out to the end of the pier. I still have a piece of what I call ""Worm Coral"" that I removed from the bottom of one of the pilings under the roundhouse out on the pier. One of my friends was a volunteer docent at the children's exhibit area in the roundhouse, and my favorite restaruants in Manahattan Beach were those with a view of the ocean and pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp

50,Nowhere Better on the Los Angeles Coastline,"If you are single, a family, or something inbetwen this is the place to wander around if you have several hours to burn. Restaurants are abundant although parking can be a challenge during the weekends and evenings. The strand next to the sand separates the bike riders from the walkers/runners. It is very safe on the upper sidewalk but watch out when crossing the bike path to gain access to the sand. The beach is to kill for with the best western facing views of the sunset every evening. The walking path runs all the way from Palos Verdes to Santa Monica. MB is only a 5 minute drive from LAX.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobWE

50,I love this place,"I love being on the pier, or under the pier, or near the pier. The roundhouse (building on the end of the pier) has a few things for very young children, but it is nice for the kid in all of us. It is a nice place to take a walk and enjoy the sight, sound, and smell of the ocean and a long, beautiful beach. El Segundo is North of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach is South of Manhattan Beach. El Segundo does not have a pier, but Hermosa Beach does. It is a nice walk, run, bike ride, or skate to go from pier to pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaJenniTravel
