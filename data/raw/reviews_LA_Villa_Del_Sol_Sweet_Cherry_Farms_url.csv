50,Great place,"My friend and I drove up from Los Angeles early Thursday morning, we were in for a great treat. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The ripe cherries were hard to reach but with the help of the staff and I'm sure the owner of the orchard we filled our buckets. I suggest you purchase a jar of honey 5he price is very reasonable.If you want to round out your morning with a hearty breakfast try Mike's Cafe which is just up the road. Turn leftover at the stop sign and you'll see the restaurant on the left. The food was very good and Carrie was very informative about the area as well as providing good service.We had an enjoyable day and will have to repeat the trip next cherry season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandiviens

50,Fun Day,"Went there on Memorial Day 2016 with my kids and we had fun cherry picking. The farm opens at 8-1 pm only on memorial weekend.It was hot and crowded but we still managed to get a parking close to the entrance of the park. There were still a lot of cherries and they are very sweet. Make sure you bring your hats and cash on hand. I just placed my sunglasses on my empty bucket for a quick picture taking and by the time i knew it, my bucket was gone. Unfortunately nobody bothered to return it on the lost and found corner of the store. Too bad, most of them were families with kids and I didnt expect somebody would just grab my bucket. Otherwise, it was our first time to bring our kids 8 & 5 y/o for cherry picking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mari_reys
40,Fun outing,"The cherry farm opens at 8am. The earlier you go, easier parking, less crowd and cooler weather!!This is the LARGEST cherry farm in Palmdale. Also, the first cherry farm on that street. Therefore, lots of people stop by this farm. Yes... it does look like zoo, super crowded!!The Admission: No admission fee. However, EVERYONE has to purchase minimum $5 of cherry. $3.75 per lb.The Cherry: They only open up one section of the cherry. Size of the cherry is kind of small compared to the market. Not super sweet.The Parking: Parking lot (FREE) and street parking. In the weekend, if you get there after 10am, the lot will be full. You can park across the street.There are many staffs walking around in the farm, making sure people are in the right section.Yes, it is easier to just go to the market and buy a box of cherry. HOWEVER, the experience of going to the farm, pick the cherry yourself. PRICELESS!! It is great family outing~",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Picking Fresh Cherries,"Located on the biggest and most powerful earthquake fault in the United States, Villa del Sol is a U Pick Cherry farm. Huge fresh cherries in a well kept grove in a beautiful valley. Looking for cheap fresh fruit? Not here. $4.00 a pound this year and people line up to do it. Up to 8,000 people a day on weekends drive up from the Los Angeles area to pick cherries. Only 3 miles from our home we drive there during the week. Been picking cherries in the Valley for 40 years with our kids and now our grand kids. A family tradition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melgru
