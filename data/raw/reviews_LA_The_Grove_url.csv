30,Trolley ride was the highlight,"Across the street from the Original Farmers Market is The Grove, a pedestrian shopping street. Not much for me in terms of shopping but happy to have found See’s Candies here.While the area is car-free, they do have a Free Double-Storey Trolley running back and forth along the street. 3mins ride from one end of the street to the other, starting from the depot, every 15 mins. The queue starting point blended so well on the street I didn’t even see it until I asked. But I guess when the trolley is parked there, it becomes very obvious. More a photo op than anything else but to me, it's the highlight of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyhx

40,Aesthetic Outdoor Shopping Mall,"I love the outdoor shopping malls of California, and this one is nicely designed. It wasn't as big as I thought, but big enough to have a wide variety of retailers available to interested shoppers. There aren't many eateries, but I imagine that's because of the Farmer's Market right next door. A quick walk through only takes a few minutes if you walk down the main street, but there are a few side streets with some stores, like the Brandy Melville that is outside the main street. Also, everyone stops by the pretty fountain to take pictures, so give yourself a good hour or two to get through this place unless you are an avid shopper and end up stopping into multiple stores.We didn't do too much shopping, but did check out every corner of this shopping area and we spent about 2 hours here in total after going through the Farmer's Market for some lunch. Just keep in mind, this place is a shopping mall, so if you have nothing to buy, it may not be worth visiting. It is nicely laid out and designed with appealing aesthetics, especially when everything, particularly the fountain, lights up at night. That is worth a photo.Combined with the Farmer's Market, it's worth a visit. And the LACMA and La Brea Tar Pits are close by (but not quite walking distance for most people although we walked it) as well if you want to make a day of it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avenjur
50,Take the cooking class at Sur La Table!,It feels like Disneyland with more shopping and no rides. It’s a fun way to spend time and money. We did a cooking class at Sur La Table that was fantastic. It went from 6:30-9:00 culminating in an amazing dinner of two kinds of fresh made pasta and sauces and a beautiful salad with fennel and oranges. We learned so many tips and tricks to take back home. I can’t wait to try some of this for friends and family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJMXX

If you want to have a nice dinner/lunch there are good restaurants, if you want to have a cup of coffee with tasty sweets there are charming cafes, if you want to catch a movie there is a cinema, if you want to shop there are many options you can choose from. However, the reason that makes this place my favorite is its atmosphere. Lovely music, beautiful trees, and a fountain... The only negative thing is it can be really crowded sometimes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaraAygen

50,Beautiful Outdoor Shopping Area,Every time I visit LA I have to go to The Grove. What is so special about it is it’s decorations and exterior designs. They had props for Halloween all set up. Background music of Nat king cole music etc playing even though you are outdoor. A mini old school tram bus to bring you from one end to another. The atmosphere was just magical. We even had aperol spritz at a cosy cafe facing the dancing fountain whilst we people watch after shopping. I remember last year when I came during Christmas and they had a massive Christmas tree and lots of decorations up. Great service as well from the waiters. Definitely will be back for a visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonanureen
50,Walkable outdoor mall,Usually very crowded with a variety stores and loads of restaurants. We went to buy some books at Barnes and Noble for some family we were visiting (they were very helpful).

30,Old/New,Not exactly sure what they had in mind when this place was designed but I was confused as to what style it was with respect to the lay out of the land . However if you’re looking for a quick bite to eat or sit outdoors at the Laduree pastry and have some fine deserts and champagne the grove has it. It also has some name brand shops and couple nice restaurants as well as Starbucks. Some of the shops and restaurants on the inside of the grove though need some work to be up to par with the rest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/130eduartl

40,not a typical shopping mall,"Most shopping malls are housed in a building with stores jammed into the retail space. This place is outdoor so on a rainy day probably not a good idea, but a sunny day alot of LA heads here. Because it is designed not like your typical shopping mall. First, there is a track runnning the length of the property that has a double decker rail car I believe the ride is free so here is something to entertain the kiddies, then there is a pond in the middle with a fountain that can be coordinated to music etc. , nearby to the pond is some grounds for sitting and the restaurants nearby have outdoor dining.Its anchored by a nordstrom store and for those looking for specialty stores like apple, barnes and noble bookstore, showcase nike store, movie theatre and a number of other unique stores can be found here. It also helps that the farmers market is right next to this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01

40,The Grove is an upscale attractive shopping center where you're here more likely to hang out..,"The Grove is an upscale attractive shopping center where you're here more likely to hang out and upload snaps or pics for the gram versus get your serious shopping or dining on...I'm not the first to say this but I definitely get a Downtown Disney kind of vibe here. The Trolley that strolls adds to it. With that, the decor changes during the seasons so definitely swing by November to December for the cool Christmas lights and decor. Chinese New Year which is usually around the end of January or beginning of February is also fun to visit. The round center fountain is showcased for the social media influencers and your own followers. The grass area is a great place to hang out in the shade and there's always kids running around. I've seen live music acts perform here randomly.The Farmers market at the end gives a great mom and pop feel in the this shopping center. Me personally, I always stop by their huge Barnes and Noble to stroll around. The stores are high end and display the latest and greatest in fashionista living.There's plenty of security and the mall is immaculately clean. You feel very safe strolling around here and that just adds to The Grove's appeal. I'm sure I'll be back hanging out next time I'm in LA. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninong247

There is a free double decker trolly that you can ride from one end to the other right up to the farmers market short ride just a few minutes but fun.The mall was easy to get to following GPS, we went from the Beverly Center (another upscale shopping mall traditional indoor) and there was plenty of indoor parking in a garage. The Grove had a pretty bridge over a small pond with a fountain which makes for a nice picture of sitting area. Highly recommend stopping here. We liked it much better than the 3rd street prominade in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyAllie
50,Barnes & Noble - Julian Lennon Signed His Latest Children's Book At The Grove,"Everyone loves the Grove, especially at Christmas time and I love book stores but had never been to a signing but this was special. I had recently joined their mailing list and when Grammy nominated musician, photographer, humanitarian and documentarian – Julian Lennon – was at the Grove on April 30th for photo-ops and signings for his final publication of the New York Times bestselling children’s books trilogy: Love the Earth. (Touch the Earth and Health the Earth complete the set.) - I went with some friends.Lennon said, “Many moons ago while on the road in Australia – I was met with an indigenous tribe and in a huge semi-circle they presented me with a huge white feather in front of 50 or more news crews, the whole works. The precursor to that is the fact that dad said to me, ‘If something ever happens to me in one shape or another the way I’m going to let you know that I’m going to be okay, you’re going to be okay and we’re all going to be okay, it will be in the form of a white feather.’ So, when I got the white feather it was to me, undeniable, you know…goose bumps. So, I thought what do I do here? I spent 10 years making a documentary about this indigenous tribe, started the White Feather Foundation to be sure they get money to keep their culture alive.’”He decided to put the White Feather Foundation into the book. The White Feather Flier represents a magical airplane that, once you’ve jumped aboard it, can take you anywhere you want on Earth. It’s an interactive book that immerses children with a fun and unique journey. It’s also interactive in that the children can plant milkweed gardens and soar with the butterflies, build schools where all kids are safe to learn and – better yet – to follow their dreams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMFredric
40,Cross between Walt Disney World & Las Vegas,"Very warm day, only spent about an hour here. Some interesting stores you don't find everywhere else. Miniature music choreographed fountain was fun to watch; not the Bellagio fountain by any means but unique in it's own right. Food market was very warm and crowded; lots of variety but prices seemed high. Parking was easy in garage. Fine for a quick stop, don't plan on spending more than a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SD8blueyes

Clean, a little bit of everything for everyone, from Nike to JCrew to Nordstrom. Chill atmosphere, which I’m finding is the vibe of choice here in LA.

40,"It's a mall, but a nice mall","It's an outdoor, walkable mall with all the usuals suspects - Pottery Barn, Nordstrom, Gap, etc. etc. Nothing unique here except for the layout. Given the SoCal weather, it's a walkable outdoor mall. It gets very crowded. What it does have going for it, however, is the nearby Farmer's Market. It's not really a farmer's market by today's definition, but is full of stalls selling food, trinkets, and other things. Great place to sit down and have some tasty local food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfm02719

There was a kids' clothing store, Janie & Jack, that I researched before going to LA and when I got there they are actually going out of business. I found an adorable baby outfit for 40% off as well as a little headband. Also it is directly behind the Farmers Market which is a great place to eat and souvenir shop.

40,Beautiful Outdoor Mall & Great Farmers Market,We have been here before and love the atmosphere of this Mall so we wanted to see how it would be decorated for the Holiday season and we were not disappointed. There was a huge Santa Claus workshop in the middle of the Mall which is where you would line up to see Santa & the Christmas tree was we think the biggest one we have ever seen and when the tree lights came on at dusk it was magical. We had lunch at The Cheesecake factory as it's just another one of those things you have to do when visiting the US. It is really just a shopping mall so you will find all the normal stores here and the Farmers Market is next door but it's well worth a visit and if nothing else it's full of beautiful people and if you are lucky you may spot a celebrity or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9666QRkareng

We went there to eat since our fave restaurant was there (The Cheese Factory) and we just loved this place! With the old street car, the fountains, even seeing a movie is fun here, take the time and if you can, get there when there's sun but stay until it's dark to see the change of atmosphere that is created! It's almost romantic being there watching the water dance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie

50,A GREAT open air walking mall,The grove truly has it all. It has every kind of designer store that you could ask for plus unique little boutique shops. Many restaurants to choose from that offer options for all. Because it is an open air walking mall they often times have entertainment for the family. This includes live music or recently when I was there they had some characters that were dancing and singing for entertainment for the children. They brought them up on the stage so they could dance and there was a lot of pictures being taken by parents. They also have a Beautiful little area that you can sit around and watch a fountain that dances to the music that’s being played. It’s a real nice water feature that meanders around with bronze sculpture pieces. I like this place because you could go there and enjoy yourself and not even spend a dime just people watching and enjoying the entertainment that they have to offer. It is definitely family friendly lots of kids lots of parents grandparents and people having a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197mischellel
30,Not worth the hype,"I have been here a couple times and have not been that impressed. It's definitely worth a visit if you haven't been especially to go to the farmers market but you probably don't need to come back a second time. The shops arent anything special, you can find all of them in malls within a couple miles. Its also always crowded with people stopping in the middle of the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/constancescalia

30,Just a mall,It's okay for shopping but I really came here to see the farmer's market which disappointted me.

Would miss if your only in town for a couple of days,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMystry20
40,Shopping with Ease,"I did a special stop at Sees Candy and have to admit this outdoor mall makes me feel spoiled. Purchases totaling $250 get you free parking. Valet service is wonderful at both entrances. The trolley ride is classic and takes you away from typical city fare.Christmas is beautiful with the entire area decorated to the 9s. Santa photos are awesome and include puppy night once a week.Nice outing and nicely capped if you explore the Farmers Market next door.,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RocioM410

30,Crowd drawer,The Grove’s Christmas theme is successful in drawing crowds from locals to tourists alike. The store and restaurant selections seem to be secondary to the festive atmosphere yet this formula works well ! It’s Farmer’s Market is another crowd drawer but the food is not so good quality though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893lynettel

50,Fun place to visit year round,"The Grove is a great place to meet up with friends, catch a movie, go with the family or do a little shopping if you feel like a top notch shopping/dining experience.I have been to the Grove several times and have always enjoyedmy experience of dining, shopping, taking in a movie or people watching. The movie theater at The Grove is beautiful. I love that you can order a drink and take it in to the theater with you, In order for me to give the theater 5 stars it would need the reclining seats and the endless choices for the soda dispenser. I did find the condiment section to be a bit dirty and the restroom was in need of more soap. 1 out of 4 of the sinks had soap. Hopefully Pacific Theaters is reading this review.The Grove is extra special at Christmas time with the beautiful Christmas decorations. Keep in mind visiting the Grove comes at an expense. Parking is not cheap. Make sure if you visit a restaurant or the movie theater to get your parking ticket validated. The max I believe is $18 and valet is $22.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwheeler1977

There’s a trolley, endless dessert shops, oldest/biggest farmers market and a number of popular stores.Visiting during the holidays is my favorite. The decorations are so beautiful. They have a giant Christmas and Santa house where you can meet the big man himself. It even snows in the evenings (runs every 15/30 mins - check the times).If you don’t need to go shopping, checking out the best public restroom is worth it too. See pictures below.....it’s fancy.If you’re visiting LA, must see. It’s next to museum row and the famous light installations.You can spend an entire day in this circumference of wonder la la land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveCaliforniaLiving

20,Christmas lighting fiasco,"I should have wrote this earlier, but I was trying to let the anger subside. I cannot board this plane without saying my peace.The grove is a wonderful little place with a plethora of eateries and clothing stores, but...... deciding to go for the christmas lighting was not in my favor. While in town for several weeks I decided to go and get my holiday spirit filled with a great dinner, some wine and the main event which was seeing the christmas tree. LA has no snow so the next best thing would be this beautiful ceremony. Well it was jammed pack, I mean NYC times square during new yrs eve congested and I felt like I was going through tsa with all the security and metal detectors. Aside from me feeling like a crab in a bucket I then decided not to eat at the establishment of my choice since the wait time was severe and try the farmers market which unknown to me did not accept card payments. I was livid!!! This is 2018 folks. Any-who because of me not being able to move around comfortably nor eat something I desired versus sacraficing my game plan I had in mind I decided to leave all together and not partake in the ceremony. I'll return, but on a normal day in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amorprohibidojunkie

You can walk, eat, see a movie, listen to music, feel romantic, see a star or two, window shop, spend like a drunken sailor or simply catch a breeze. The vendors don't offer utilitarian; they offer soft and superfluous but being there fuels the imagination. I enjoy myself every visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492nathanieln
30,More hype than substance,The most impressive thing is the parking structure. Not a very large assortment of shopping. Nice Christmas decor. Live music ( bad). The Farmer's market nextdoor is great for eating but not much more. At least I can say I've been to the Grove. Whoopee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249EricY

Plenty of stores, including Cheesecake Factory and Nordstrom's. Property management does a great job with their ""holiday decorations"" (AKA: Christmas decor) and special events throughout the year.

50,Lovely Outdoor Mall,"OK, so lots of same same brand stores, but how lovely to walk around this pedestrian zone and stroll from shop to shop with the sun, shade and breeze of the outdoors with you as opposed to AC-filled experience. Nordstrom the big anchor, but lots of upscale shops, a farmers’ market, too, and interesting eateries make this a lovely place to shop and experience how shopping can be in this climate so suited to the outdoors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney

30,The Grove,Parking is difficult and if you are going to hopefully get great deals. Probably not going to happen. These store are on the high end of price range. Its a nice walk if the crowds are not crazy. Was there on the weekend and I was ready to leave after 30 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trex63
40,Fun place,Plenty to choose from. So much to offer. Many quality restaurants. Farmers market is really large. Three story Barnes and noble is crazy big. Parking available. I think it was 24 bucks for the day. Lots to see in the immediate area too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertc641
50,OMG - an amazing shopping/relaxing/eating destination,"Visited from the UK as a family of 3 - 2 adults and 1 teen. Our daughter had read about “the cronut” and it was on her list of “must dos” whilst in LA for 4 days. - see review Dominique Ansel Bakery for that. It was the cronut that brought us to The Grove.It was a busy, hot day yet the atmosphere was one of relaxation. The pool and fountains added wonderfully to that feeling.The choice of shops was great - out daughter is powered by books, food clothes and music and this place was perfect for her (and us).The staff in all the shops were very helpful especially the chap in Mac with his own immaculate full face make up who patiently helped us choose lipsticks.Something which I am not used to seeing in the uk is dogs in stores. So lovely to see that at The Grove at least - this is perfectly acceptable. My chocolate Labrador would love all the extra fuss going shopping would bring!We also visited the farmers market - see (separate review for Nona’s Empanadas). Had a very enjoyable time seeing all the amazing foods available. There was a great buzz about the place and so much to choose from.Wish we were in LA longer as would definitely return here many times.The rest rooms at the Grove car park have to be the poshest toilets I have ever used in my life! Red carpet entrances, spotlessly clean, small individual hand towels, hand cream etc Certainly not your NCP standard back in the uk. If you spend a penny there - be sure to tip the attendant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownspeeddog
40,Upscale Outdoor Shopping Mall,"If you've seen one shopping mall... you've seen most of them. The Grove's collection of national chains and upscale fashion shops can be found in plenty of other malls and shopping districts, along with the inviting outdoor setting with the fountain and small bandstand area. The two teenagers with us definitely enjoyed it more than we did, as we found the adjacent Farmers Market to be a far more interesting venue. Probably a good compromise if you have teens: send them to the mall, while you explore the great variety of food stalls and shops at the Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
50,"Shop, eat, drink, just don’t sleep!","Shop, eat, drink, just don’t sleep. Fanciful rethinking of the iconic Farmers Market. Diverse blend of shops and restaurants. Great bars and cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad

Just like any other mall, it offers many high end shops and restaurants, many with outdoor seating to see and be seen.Keep walking and you end up in the Farmers Market, which was fun to explore. Lots of interesting food shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuddyV_12
30,Normal shopping district,"Wouldn’t put this spot on my must-see list for Los Angeles. A lot of shopping areas are popping up that are very similar to The Grove. They did seem to have live music there before we arrived; therefore, maybe get there between 6-8 and you will have a better experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macawleyb2018
40,Surprisingly popular tourist spot!,"A beautiful location, lots of eating options, good shopping AND a movie theater. Being a local, I didn't expect sooo many visiting friends and family to be so taken with this beautiful outdoor mall. Yes, it's wonderful and I love it, but WOW - people LOVE this place!Personally, the food is why I come here. Between the restaurant and the farmers market spots, you'll eat well and be satisfied.And stay for a fountain show :) they're fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shaheens

Has a movie theater, 2-story Barnes & Noble that gets good guest appearances, and several nice restaurants and specialty stores. The fountain area often has entertainment or special things for the holidays. Parking can be challenging around Christmas but it has a large parking structure. Check website for current fees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelw411
30,It was ok,We went to this place from someone that told us to go. We have a toddler. The place is nice. Food was unique and different. French toast was really good. And the breakfast tacos were good the taco bread was nasty. The place is not good for toddlers and younger with a stroller. You have to grab your drinks and number and find a seat. Some of the staff members were rude.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1565FWangelat
40,Classical and modern,"ONLY VISIT IN DECEMBERThe mall has a 1900’s classical theme with a farmers market from I believe the 1800’s.There is classical music playing from the 1900’s and a train that goes from each end of the mall to the other that you can go on complimentary,which isn’t always available. The stores however are modern just the usual stores you would find in any mall (Apple,Zara,Nordstrom,extr). Primarily I only go during the month of December because they have Christmas decoration and fake snow which makes it a cool experience however during the other months I prefer to go to other places such as century city (which has been newly remodeled btw.) Unless your visiting in December I would not recommend coming here you will get bored in no time. The movie theater isn’t that great the seats are uncomfortable to sit in for 2 hrs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghost_reviews
50,Great shopping,My daughter and I visited the grove twice during our stay in the LA area. We enjoyed the stores and beautiful design. We had lunch and dinner at the grocery and the food was outstanding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/upintheair7769
40,Indulgence is a lifestyle too!,"Open all days of the week, The Grove in Los Angeles styles itself as a dining, shopping and lifestyle destination. Open for business for about the last twenty tears, it is all of this for sure. A place where people spend the day shopping, punctuate it with dining, even as they soak in all the excitement and energy of the place.Business hours for The Grove are 10am through 9pm, though individual stores and dining outlets here may have different working hours.The Grove is all geometrically laid out roads and slick shop fronts displaying their wares and their outrageous prices. But then, this is what bespoke shopping is all about isn't it? The big names are all here - Coach, Crate and Barrel, Michael Kors, J Crew, Swarovski, Banana Republic, Apple, Nike, Nordstrom - to name just a few.When it comes to dining, a wide range of cuisines is on offer - French, Italian, Japanese, Thai - and multiple dining options - bistro, al fresco, family dining places.189 by Dominique Ansel is the star experience here - yes, that's right the Cronut chef. The restaurant is located above the Dominique Ansel Bakery. Ladurée offers its famous macarons and pastries and a breakfast-lunch-dinner menu. See's Candies has a mind boggling range of candies and chocolates to tempt the visitor - and it doesn't matter if you don't buy, they're generous with their free samples! The Cheesecake Factory is here too with its mouthwatering cheesecakes and desserts plus pasta, salads, pizza and more. Don't miss Umami Burger - they dish out some amazing, uniquely tasty stuff. Other dining options include Maggiano's Little Italy, Bar Verde at Nordstrom and La Piazza.If it is movies you fancy, catch them at Pacific Theatres. Another major draw at The Grove is the electric powered double decker trolley - see all the self-conscious adults on the top deck even as the kids enjoy themselves on the ride! The dancing fountain in front of the theatre is another big show at The Grove.The Spirit of Los Angeles statue, the dancing fountain and the double decker trolley are the irresistible photo opps at The Grove. Indeed The Grove itself is so neatly assembled that it resembles a giant film set - but those people struggling with huge shopping bags are real bulge bracket buyers, not extras on a film set!The Grove is a fun place to spend a day and if your wallet can take it, so much the better. After all, indulgence is a lifestyle too, if you can afford it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
40,Beautiful outdoor mall near Farmers Market,"Really enjoyed shopping here. Great look, nice shops and near Farmers Market so you get to see both!

Recommend coming early before it gets busy. Enjoyable shopping experience and recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sr349
40,Fun little shopping center,We stayed right across the street from this place & it was great! It gets busy though. They have some department stores & other little stores as well. They have restaurants & bakery’s which were delicious! It also has a Movie theater which is where we saw Hotel Transylvania 3 with the kids. The seats are comfy but do not recline. The Grove is across a small street from the Farmers market which offered even more stores & eateries. It was clean & well kept!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kchitaphong

The shops were the typical mall shops, and we were hoping for something a little different, but we still enjoyed ourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285dawnf
50,Fantastic place to visit,"This is a lovely shopping centre with entertainment and a fun atmosphere.

We are here for AG and fun to design a shirt, dress, outfit for your doll or design a doll. You must spend $250 or more for the entire day to not pay for parking. See's service was awesome! Laduree and the place next to it has great food. Ham and cheese croissant is probably the best deal on the menu. Laduree is not the same as in France or UK.....disappointing. Loud music and rude server.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egamama
50,Excellent Concert Venue,"While in LA, my husband and I purchased tickets to the YES 50th anniversary tour booked at The Grove in Anaheim. The venue was intimate, sound was incredible and of course, YES was fantastic. The Grove has easy access and parking, restaurant and bar which were part of our ticket was very nice. Will return here again in the future and hopefully for another excellent concert.",
40,Something for everyone,"From American Girl to Nike, Taschen to Macy’s there was something for the whole family at the Grove. Kids were entertained and the adults indulged their respective shopping obsessions! Plus it’s a scenic shopping spot.",

40,Great atmosphere,Loved the live music that was playing and the atmosphere. We lay back on the grassed area enjoying and people watching. Loads of places to shop and eat. Perfect to include a visit to the Farmers Market.,
50,"Love,Love this place","The Grove is a nice place to visit and the atmosphere is great. Even if you don't shop it a good place to have lunch and enjoy the day. If you are a person who loves to shop then this is where you need to be. Furthermore, the farmer's market is in the same area there you will find all kinds of cuisine. If you get tired of walking there are areas where you can go and sit and just people watch.Wear comfortable shoes. This place is a must see. Love it!!!Nita G-Arizona",
50,Nice place to be at even if you're not shopping,"Nice place with a pleasant atmosphere. Aesthetically pleasing. Even if you're not shopping, the whole aura of the place is pleasing. I'd love to come back. It's a plus that this place is right next to the farmer's market. There's a free tram ride which will bring you on a [short] ride throughout the grove, recommend to go on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethKayN
50,Fun even if you’re not shopping,"The description given of the place is apt - more than a mall it feels like an adult amusement park. Yes, technically it is an outdoor mall, but it’s made so pretty you wouldn’t want to spend time inside the shops. The fountain surrounded by outdoor eating and drinking places is lovely. The day we were there, there was a live music show and families/couples were lounging on the ground, enjoying the music. Such a happy vibe! It was a great way to relax! As for shopping, you’ve got a lot of big brands here, but I found the collection at all the shops limited. The only shop I really enjoyed going to was Barnes & Nobles. Lovely collection of books!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Touristy_D
40,Good shopping,"Good shopping, nice restaurants, worth checking out! Fairly busy, parking wasn't too bad and didn't have much issue getting around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBMatt1147
50,Treat Yourself,"Bring your credit cards, and ladies especially ~ wear comfy shoes! This place is awesome, there is so much shopping to do, and lots of big end stores especially. I loved the fountain with a cute cafe around it. There is a movie theater, and so many restaurants. I think it would take several days to properly work through The Grove and visit everything. If you have small children, the police box has coloring pages to give them. I wouldn't rock your awesome new designer heels unless you have someone to help, because the surface is a little uneven walking around. Take in the Grove, and retreat the Unami burger when you want to get out of the hustle and bustle!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bakedgoods317
50,"A lovely bit of fun, shopping, eating, strolling and more.","For a nice day out in LA, pop on over to the Grove. It has a variety of lovely stores, some amazing restaurants of all levels, a nice path to walk and plenty of parking. From Cheesecake Factory to my favorite Kitchen store, Sur La Table, a massive Apple store, Crate and Barrel and so much more there's something for everyone to find. It's a typical tourist spot - but also mixed with many locals who are after a contained area that has loads to offer.And right next door - attached actually is the world famous Farmer's Market. Now this is very popular with all the locals and still brings in the tourists.Everyone who visits LA wants to see some of the typical spots and this checks all the boxes.Over the years I have spotted the occasional well know actor which is always fun.I recommend a couple hours here at least, and it's always a great spot to return to for dinner. Particularly lovely on a warm night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynz463
50,Great shopping and gourmet,"Wonderful place to shop, spend time with family, watch movies and eat in open patios. It's an all pedestrian zone and could easily be a full day's tour if farmer's market is also included.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumitBanga

Lots of shopping options, beautiful fountain, and cool trolley.Nice place for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamlayton3
50,Lots of great shops,"The Grove is part tourist destination, part shopping. My friend and I needed to pass time before a dinner reservation and given all the food, drink and shopping options we easily passed 3 hours. Stores are more upscale without being all designer. The outside is very clean. Washrooms were clean.Our parking was validated based on the purchases we made. I'd return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,My favorite Shopping in L.A!,"I've been to all the malls in Los Angeles region and I love the Grove the most. If you like shopping malls for mainly the experience, this is the place to come. You also have a nice selection of all your favorite stores like Apple, Nordstrom, movie theatre and eateries. The joy of this complex lies in the setup and the neighborhood. It is located within walking distance of the CBS studios, the Holocaust Museum and the Farmer's Market. The Farmers Market is shaded and provides lots of eating choices adjacent to the Grove.The parking is easy and safe, with escalators taking you down from each floor and you don't feel like you will be run over trying to get out of the garage. Also the views of Los Angeles are amazing from the parking garage. This is a classy mall.Head downstairs and you have a wonderful fountain with music and a trolley. If you want to experience shopping L.A style, this is the place to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG

50,I took my 5 1/2 year old granddaughter to the American Doll store in the Grove for the first time today.,"I had made a reservation for lunch and had no idea what to expect at the store. Other reviews had indicated that the store was smaller than they anticipated and that there was poor customer service. That was not my experience. Since neither I nor my granddaughter knew how to shop or what to expect I walked up to a cashier when we first walked in and asked where to start. She took us to the beginning of the store and explained the layout and the different types of dolls and her experience with American Girl dolls. She had her first one when she was three and now she is 22!Then we began to look around and see how the dolls were displayed and it was soon time for lunch. That was a fabulous experience. We had the greatest waiter. He made everything so much fun. The lunch was actually not a gourmet experience for me but was very nicely presented with the waiter giving my little girl so much attention. He showed her how to place the doll she had chosen to borrow as a little friend during lunch (there is a large display from which to choose just for lunch itself.) They put he doll in a chair which fit on the table just like a chair we have for babies at our house. There were about four courses of food and more than enough to eat. There were even some small surprise gifts for the girls to take home.The dining room itself is a totally pink, girlish environment with beautiful touches of decorations and we were treated like royalty. The store is immaculate and quite large on two stories of showrooms. Walking through the Grove is an experience in itself. The stores didn't interest me a lot but I am not much of a shopper. But the landscaping is magical and even better than Disneyland. People shopping were very friendly and I had three other grandmotherly women come up to me and comment on what joy I must be having with my granddaughter as she had dressed herself very nicely and was on her very best behavior.After lunch we returned to the dolls and made a choice of one which looked most like my granddaughter. The entire experience was quite costly but was a once in a lifetime first for us to share with each other. All the way home in the car we noticed how a girl could bond with such a special doll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy4413
30,Beautiful but watch your back,"Beautiful place and beautiful stores but ""please"" remember no matter where you are, no matter how nice the place, you always need to be on alert. On June 9th, right after lunch time, we heard a loud thump then a loud commotion. People screaming by the Jurassic World Dinosaur. There was a child on the ground crying. There was a guy on a bicycle racing violently through the crowd. The father of the injured child then stopped the robber right in front of the JCrew store by running after him, grabbing his back pack and confronting him. This father is a hero. His young child was hit and knocked down by the robber's bicycle while the robber was trying to get away from apparently stealing a ladies cell phone. All I know is this perp would have gotten away if this father had not stopped him. Mall security then a guy in a blue suit showed up to ask questions. By the time we left, the police had arrived. There is a protocol for these situations. I blame this on individuals/businesses being terrified of being sued. Kuddos to the father for not backing down and holding this individual accountable for his actions by filing charges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjkinsel
40,Very nicely done... good place to walk around,"We decided to head here on recommendation from our Hollywood Hills tour. There are food markets next to here which are fantastic to grab a bite to eat. This is a really nice area to walk around, clean, tidy and not to busy.

There is also a little tram that you can get on to take you from one end to the other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
10,Parking is horrible,"They claim to validate then still charge full price...will not shop here again. Came here for a day of shopping, while taking care to get my parking ticket validated each place I stopped.

It has shops, boutiques, small and bigger restaurants. A nice Farmer' market and a Starbucks makes even more complete. I love this place especially in winter with snowing ability. The biggest Christmas tree and lots of other options are ready for visitors and tourists. Don't forget to have a nice meal in cheesecake factory.

And once you are done, you could pass by farmer's market right next to it for food, dessert or a drink. It's just relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517abrars
50,A perfect morning visit,"It is an outdoors mall that looks like a lovely park, has a great music (Fanc Sinatra times) and it is a neighbour of The original Farmers Market so you can kill 2 birds in 1 shot. I had it in my list as a sight-seeing spot, not shopping and it is perfect for the morning visit (had a nice breakfast at the Farmers Market right after!)About the parking. The Grove has its on big indoors parking. 1st hour is for free. The 1.5 hour is 3 dollars and so it goes. But there are stores that are giving the validation for the free 2 hours parking for any purchase. (a bookstore for example)Important that the Farmers market cafes and shops are not giving the validations for the Grove parking (they have their own outdoors parking right next to it) so before you put your car - decide where you are going to spend your money to get the right validation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733svetas

I had heard of it for years, but did not really know much about it. After my visit, I have to say it was absolutely worth the trip. The food market is amazing.

If you are someone that loves Outdoor Food Markets, People Watching and Fun Shopping, this is your cup of tea. I definitely recommend this as a must see when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Group-Travel-Advisor

30,Bakery worth the trip,Outdoor shopping mall and farmers market. Normal stores you can find at your local malls. Best place was the ornate bakery on the corner named Dominique Ansrl Bakery. OMG! Worth the parking and battle of the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meshell336
30,Slightly upscale mall,The layout and the style (think film studio lot) is really good but the shopping itself is average or below. As for 'it' brands there's only one and that's Tesla who's residing inside the small Nordstrom shop. Small Barneys bransch fail to impress. Eating options are very limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arneby
40,Nice outdoor shopping and food area,"This is a nice outdoor shopping area. There are fountains that dance to the music, a movie theatre and multiple shops like: Micheal Kors, Brandy Melville, Banana Republic, Zara, Barnes & Noble, Nordstrom, and many other stores. There is also a nice ""Flea Market' at one end. It has different small eateries as well as some trinket shops.There is a trolly that circles the shopping area in case you have walked enough. At the opposite end of the shopping area there is a grassy patch that entertains during the seasons, ex. Easter Bunny, Santa Clause, etc.I would suggest a visit to shop or just walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelique717

50,Chic shops and restaurants with a positive vibe,This gem of an area was just a quick 20 minute Uber ride for me from downtown LA. I had a free afternoon and this short trek was perfect. Anchored by Nordstrom I found some of my favorite retail shops here. It was also a nice surprise to find the only Elizabeth and James store in the country. I loved the fountains and the farmers market. The Grove makes for an enjoyable afternoon even if you don't make a purchase.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnaeb2016

40,Parking Costs Warning,"This is just a warning about the parking fees in the structure. We visited for about 2-1/2 hours which included eating at the Cheesecake Factory and getting our ticket validated. We were surprised when we went to pay for parking at the kiosk that it was still $7.00. Apparently, even though you get 2 hours of free parking from validation, the Grove Mgmt has decided that this is voided if you stay even 1 minute more than the 2 hours. You will pay the full parking amount as if you stayed 2-1/2 hours (in our case) without validation. This is a ridiculous policy and this is only location/management that I know of that charges for parking like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6724VVmichaell
50,Lots of dinner and shopping choices,"Beautiful outdoor mall with upscale (and normal) shopping choices and tons of options for dinner or lunch. Movie theater. Lots of parking.

40,Beautiful high end shopping.,The Grove is a beautiful venue for shopping. Well designed with lovely flowers and a central fountain display. Good selection of stores and restaurants provided for an enjoyable morning of shopping and eating. Parking is a bit pricey. I do feel that the retail workers here are a bit snobby in general. Perhaps this is just the LA way but it is noticeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferH456

10,"Advertised as dog-friendly, but totally not.","I have been to the Grove several times since I live in LA. It's a very manicured outdoor mall- that's basically the extent of it. The farmer's market is nice, and the shopping is fine. However, they claim to be dog-friendly, except they have a horrific policy against pit bulls of any kind. I have seen people asked to leave with perfectly well-behaved pit bulls. Meanwhile, people with tiny, yappy dogs are allowed to ignore all dog etiquette and let their dogs roam far away on extendable leashes, run up to unsuspecting people, and bark their heads off. Last time I was at the Grove, a woman has her dog/rodent in Banana Republic. She was letting it roam on its leash and IT BIT ME! Pit bulls (which are usually extremely loyal and gentle) are not allowed but these tiny terrors are?? Rethink your policies, Grove. It's the dog owners who are problematic, not the breed. You should be asking people like that woman to leave (By the way, the Banana Republic staff saw this dog bark at me and bite my foot and said nothing to the woman).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samd113

50,Good shopping and food destination,"Located next to the farmers market which is also a worthwhile visit. We went at Christmas time so as you can see from the photos there is a big emphasis on the Christmas theming which they have done really well.It’s essentially an outside mall with a variety of higher end shops, restaurants, coffee shops etc but very high end. There is a trolley cart available that runs the length of the place but it’s very easy to walk around.There is also a movie theatre complex and ample paid parking spaces available including valet parking. The guest services is very high quality. Worth a visit if you include the farmers market and a restaurant meal to round it out, you would then easily take a good few hours or more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenwN4968LY

Always bustling with mostly tourists, but worth a visit, and possibly not as crowded if you go not around th holidays.There’s a farmers market with less expensive food and a variety of offerings.Definitely a place to bring the kids for a trolley ride and at night a water show in the small lake. The Fountain Bar is great for couples, but expect to wait.My choices for type of visit did not include family with grown children which was the case. I also took my small chihuahua on this trip and she thoroughly enjoyed herself. LA is a dog lover’s city.Visit the website for events and if you park in the covered parking, go to the roof, there are elevators to the floor below, and see a fantastic view of LA. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel
30,"A bit too precious, but still an entertaining place to shop","The Grove was one of the first destination malls in Los Angeles, a faux town square that invites Angelenos to get out of their cars and stroll among (mostly pricey) shops and restaurants. It has synchronized fountains and an excellent movie theater. The piped in music can be annoying, but overall, a fun place to shop and people-watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathantA7224YX
30,Interesting outdoor concept.,"The malls is centered around a walking street approach which gives it a hometown feeling. It offers anything from the farmer market to the usual mid range shops. We tried the brazilian food at the outdoor market, where you weight your plate, the lamb turned out to be very salty while the chicken bacon wrapped was dry. In late november we could enjoy the season s decorations and activities. At the central place they were taping a tv show limiting the access. Most boutiques stores can be found at other shopping malls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/216spring
50,Magical during the holidays.,"The most beautiful mall I’ve ever been to. Luckily for me, I visited The Grove with the holidays in full swing. The outdoor mall got transformed into a magical winter wonderland. In my opinion it’s best to go there after sunset when everything is lit up. It adds to the atmosphere in my opinion. Of course shopping there is a treat in itself with high end stores like MK, Coach, and Nordstrom stationed there to just names few. They also have a trolley there that’s fun to ride as well. If you visited LA, you definitely would want to add The Grove to your schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F805IQantoniop
50,Great farmers markets,One of my favorite places in LA. The shopping area is cool but a must is the farmers market. There are several restaurants with amazing food (my favorite is the Brazilian barbecue). I love the atmosphere. I always stop by there after shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkrejcir
40,Great place,Stopped in to check out this really fantastic place. Plenty of parking. Max 24.00 a day. So much to see. Largest Barnes and noble I have ever been in. (Three stories tall). Super large farmers market with a very impressive selection of food. Both take home and ready to eat now. We had the empanadas from nonnas and the borekas from Moises. They were fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertc641
50,A must see!,Visiting LA? Please do go to the Grove! Amazing shopping and also a fun place to be with children. No worries about parking there is a lot of space even if you have to get to the farmers market/ whole foods or Kmart there is space. At the Grove you will be entertaint from the moment you walked down the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farietje
50,The complete package,I haven’t been excited about a mall in a while. This mall has everything from fine shopping to a variety of dining choices including the super interesting Farmer’s Market with all types of cuisines and price points.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoSieber
50,Christmas at The Grove,"Snow, flying Santa, reindeer high up above and water fountains that dance? All this and more every Christmas season at LA's Grove. Despite the long lines (you used to be able to make reservations) for Santa's house, it truly is a festive time of year where it's easy to forget you're in the desert. Part mall, part farmer's market, part luxury place to people watch and be seen. Bottom line: it's a fun and festive way to spend the days and or evenings between Thanksgiving and Christmas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UrbanNomadinMIA
30,It's a MALL! What else do you want to know?,"Bright and shiny stores. Spotless perfect streets. Stores on every side with sticker prices that make you wish you'd stayed home and shopped online at Amazon. Pretentious, overdressed people wandering about and filling their shopping bags with instant bling. And a parking structure that looks like it might have been designed by Temple Grandin - for cattle encountering terrifying chutes for the first time. My advice would simply be to say at home -- were it NOT for the fact the whole place was right next door to the Farmers' Market, which is a delight to wander. The Farmers' Market saves The Grove experience. Remember this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Primo54
10,Over rated,"Over priced, not enough options of food, popcorn machine is on and loud while were watching the movie, sound system not loud enough, drinks arent cold and no option of having ice, being forced to pay for food even if we dont want it, no toilets, worst experience in my life, never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499naderm
50,I adore this shopping place especially right after Thanksgiving. Charming decorations!!,"Such a fun place to shop. Trolley's, restaurants, shops, farmers market at the end. Book stores, etc. Just a fun place to people watch and shop with lots of places and benches to stop if you get tired or just take the trolley from one end to the other. One of my most favorite places in LA, not for the shopping but for the energy.It is so well decorated for Christmas with a sleigh and reindeers wired up in the sky. A huge gingerbread shop and a life-size stuffed snowman and gingerbread man in suits to have your picture taken with. Such fun!! Lots of places to eat in restaurants or take out place down in the Farmers Market",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntTink
50,"Great, experiential, open air hybrid mall experience w/ shopping, food, people","Went to experience The Grove with family on a Saturday afternoon; quite an adventure. Stunning array of stores upscale to moderate scale, farmer's market, large number of restaurants and eateries, fun people watching and trolley car to ride. Wonderful place to spend an afternoon with family whether eating, shopping or just people watching. Recommend highly for a place to go for a whole family event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smitty09876
40,"A bit of a tourist trap, but some decent restaurants, great people watching, and a great movie theater.","If the weather is nice, this is one of the best places to people watch in LA. Clean, great Christmas decorations, and the trolley goes occasionally. Lots of people walking their dogs, and many small kids near the fountain here.Nice outdoor seating in some restaurants. Skip the chain restaurants, you can go to the Cheesecake Factory almost anywhere.Very nice movie theater, but not cheap at all.I wish they had a few more benches to sit at, though. The Farmers market is nearby, with some other great restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimitoCartero
40,Hollywood Mall,"The Grove is a trendy shopping, dining and entertainment precinct in West Hollywood where you can spot the rich and famous. It’s also close to a few other places of note, CBS Studios and the Writers Guild of America which I walked past. I spent the better part of my last day in LA at The Grove looking around including at the adjacent Farmers Markets. Key shops in the Grove worth checking out include Barnes & Noble (with regular celebrity book signings), Gap, Banana Republic, Cheesecake Factory & the Pacific Theatres (14 screen cinema). It’s a pleasant mall with a nice fountain and street entertainment from time to time as well as a free tram between the Grove & the Farmers Market (don’t bother, the two are right next to each other!) I ate at Cheesecake Factory & Cafe Marmalade and would recommend both. Worth checking out whilst in LA. I’m not sure how it compares with the other major mall nearby, the Beverly Center, but both seem equally famous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7
30,Christmas time is beautiful,This area is very crowded and loud but the decorations are beautiful. Dining is pricy but appears to have great options for a variety of customers. The shopping is pricy too. I guess this is a nice place to visit and slowly walk around and enjoy without spending too much... unless you want to. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kseam6259
40,Lovely upscale mall near Farmers Market,"The Grove is an upmarket mall with well known stores such as Nordstrom and Michael Kors, and more.The Grove has many restaurants like Maggiano's Little Italy and The Cheesecake Factory. There is also a 14-screen movie theater.Next door is the excellent Farmers Market with a lovely food court with many great food options. There is a free tram between The Grove and The Farmers Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommomelbourne
50,Best Xmas decorations,Yes it’s a shopping centre. But by making use of the outdoor nature of the centre they have put on a really superb display for the holidays. It wouldn’t matter what religion you are come and enjoy. Recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
40,Unique experience in the heart of LA,"This outdoor mall is a truly unique destination in the heart of west Hollywood. Parking is usually abundant except when there is a special event or its a holiday in which case watch out. Looking for a parking space becomes a dog-eat-dog undertaking. What makes the Grove so special I think is the unique approach to the layout. It’s like a small open air neighborhood almost with a movie backlot feel. It’s feels small and cozy and it’s just very pretty to look at. The only caveat (downside) of this mall is that it’s targeting an upscale clientele. Unless you are well heeled financially, this is a sighseeing destination only. You will run into a lot of tourists here.The other reason this is a great destination is that the Farmer’s market is right next door. That alone is worth the visit. If you’re in the area then this is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeteranWorldTravellr
40,Cool Place. Parking Sucks.,"First off, the Grove is awesome. What is a shame is that the urban design is sub-par since it is always such a pain to find a parking space and get out of there once you are trying to leave.Being a architecture grad, I get it that the land is expensive and there are skyline height limits in place, but I truly believe this place could have been even more successful if the parking was handled in a different manner. The majority of people I talk to who are from the city or visiting typically complain about this fact when the Grove is brought up.Traveler Tip: I'd Uber/Lyft if possible to avoid having to find parking OR simply just be patient and not let it affect your overall experience.Overall: I think there are other places in LA to go depending on what you are looking for. If shopping, head to a mall (there will be a lot more stores to choose from). If restaurants, there are plenty all over LA that have their own parking lots.I'm a fellow traveler so I appreciate when other people have given me tips/recommendations while in a new city.

Even if this review helps only one traveler then it's worth it to know I'm contributing towards making someone's experience better, giving to the global community, and paying it forward.

50,Great location and shops,The farmers market cafes and food vendors is the best part. lots to see and take in at this location!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanaeb2017
40,Pleasantly surprised,"An outdoor mall located in the heart of LA, there is a solid selection of newer stores together with a farmers market.They have a large parkade right beside it that is right beside it.A tram runs up and down the Main Street, everything is nicely decorated, with a pond and fountain in the middleA good selection of restaurants, stores, farmers market and a massive theatre.The farmers market has a mix of retail, food booths, baked goods, meats, whatever you want and you can each order and then sit at tables in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDude1974
50,The Grove Farmers Market,"Great markets. Great place to meet up with friends. Great place to kill a couple of hours. There's plenty to see, eat and buy here at Grove Markets, and the Grove itself comes alive at night. Loved the pond with the fountain in the middle of the plaza and the little tram is really special, particularly for the younger ones.Prices can vary from cheap to expensive depending on what you are looking at and the same item may vary in price from store to store or stall to stall, so as always, do you homework if you are going there to purchase a particular item.There are restrooms on site, cafes, a couple of more upmarket restaurants and of course, many street stalls offering a wide array of menus and wares, so no one could possibly come out of there feeling hungry.A fairly large carpark is opposite The Grove,servicing the shops on that side but you'll probably get a park in there. Otherwise catch an uber, bus or taxi. They'll all know how to get there!We visited the Grove just for a look around and stayed there for dinner. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and loved the atmosphere of the place.My only disappointment is that we probably wont get time to go back again before we leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatm27
40,Shopping and Dinning,"A good family friendly place to go. A pedestrian only street with shops, restaurants and a cinema theatre. There is also a tram that you can get that goes up and down the street. Overall it was enjoyable however if your time is limited then you can definitely skip this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldnAdvice
50,Fantastic Discovery on our tour of LA,"On a tour of LA we had lunch at the grove. It's one of these places that just stands out. Busy, popular with great shopping, restaurants and facilities. It's a little Gem. I'd not heard much about The Grove before my visit to LA- but I am so glad our tour included it. There are plenty of shops and places to eat that you can easily spend half a day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263markj
50,Great stop at The Grove and the LA Farmer's Market,"Our Segway tour guide suggested a visit to this place after our tour and we were very happy we chose to follow his suggestion. The Grove is a very nice shopping/dining/attraction area and is situated near the LA farmers market. The LA farmers market is a fascinating conglomeration of food booths, retail product stalls, produce, meats, bakery goods.....really just about any type of food that you can imagine. What is nice about it is that you can find a variety of choices to suit all tastes and then sit at tables nearby, each with your different food choices. It is a casual, lively environment and much of the food is reasonably priced as opposed to going to a sit down restaurant. This is a good place to visit for people of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kehappytraveler

This is a glamourous area for shopping with a great selection of shops for every type of thing you’d need. There is a cinema there as well plus the food market on hand for a quick snack. The fountain in the middle is lovely and it is a great way to while away the afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6519NUlizm
40,Good shopping experience and place for lunch.,"This outdoor shopping mall with a market has a variety of shops, from larger chain department stores to unique boutique shops. There are a few options for eating or having a drink after eating, and although The Grove was busy we had no trouble finding a table and being served quickly. A well maintained area and easy to navigate around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Walshfamily4
40,Beautiful Location,"The grove was beautiful - a gorgeous outdoor mall with a nice water fountain and grassy area. There are a few food carts outside, some restaurants and of course shops.

50,Check Out the Farmers Market,"This is a nice outside mall, for lack of better description. They have a number of known brand and higher end shops to pick from as well as a movie theater and some restaurants. I have been here a number of times, and honestly the reason is for their farmers market on the far end from the parking garage. There are so many unique places and smells going on in this place, it always makes it worth it to stop by any time I am in L.A. to try something different. The one thing you need to keep in mind is, many of the shops are CASH ONLY, so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel

40,"Touristy, tasty, trendy.","The Grove is for sure a tourist attraption, for sure. Not in a negative sense, mind you. Families with children hang out to look, eat, and enjoy typical American popularism. Fansy department stores and food fansies line along paths of this outdoorsy mall. Prices aren’t hot, but varietal displays of carbotonics and deepfries sure turn heads of hungry hippos.Summary: The Grove is very L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophistra
50,Great area,This area has so many different things going on with bands playing & the workers give you blankets to sit on & watch them while sitting in the grass area or you can get a table plus the trolly they have is free & a nice thing to do. We walked around & shopped in almost every store & saw a couple famous people as well. If youre in the area try visiting the Farmers Market though. I have to go back with more friends to enjoy this even more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dayzmylasdad
40,"Beautiful, higher end shopping.","It's definitely an upscale mall and of course a little pricey, but a really nice place to walk around and visit. Right next to it is the farmers market and that's where I would go to get my meal, variety is great. But the mall itself has many different shops to pursue in. It is a little small as malls go but very nicely laid out and manicured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pizzaexplorer

Not enough of our types of shops to spend a day wandering but I guess it depends on your taste. Certainly a pleasant area, laid back and not too busy. The farmers market at the end had some scrumptious looking food and was also interesting to look around. Both the grove and farmers market smaller than I imagined but nice to visit all the same",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caralineheather

40,Pleasant shopping area adjacent to Farmers Market,"Airy shopping parade with many big names. However, it overall seemed quite bland and similar to a Disney set.

50,Great Mall. Try the Theater or Specialty Restaurants.,"Great outdoor mall that has many enticing options. The movie theaters now have a bar, so you can have an alcoholic drink with your popcorn and movie. The Cheesecake Factory offers a nice balcony, but it's always busy, so expect to wait.

50,So Awesome especially when decorated for Christmas!,Be sure to stop here even just to take a quick walk around it really is a beautiful outdoor mall. I'm not one that really enjoys shopping either but I always take a quick stroll through when I'm in the LA area. I always park here when visiting CBS studios anyways so I usually stop by the mall after my visit there.There is a train that takes you from one end to another that the kids absolutely love.

40,Very nice!,"Other than the parking zoo, the mall is great! Originally came to visit LA for a brunch and show at the magic Castle. After the show we were driving around and stumbled upon the place.Great ambience, packed with people, a world of choices for whatever style of food you're in the mood for and every store to satisfy your shopping desires! I particularly liked the many restaurants and bars with outdoor seating. The farmers market adjacent to the grove is also fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrSotomayor
40,Lovely area for shopping - vibrant place to eat.,"The Grove area is an outdoor mall with high end shops and a quaint free tram that you can ride from one end to the other. Its a really great atmosphere with bars and restaurants offering outdoor seating and family friendly too.Further down the main street is The Farmer's Market offering a wide range of world foods, allowing a family to all choose their own meals and then come together in the shared seating areas. Everything from Gumbo to Pizza, Cookies to Empanadas. Prices varied but seemed reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanF361
40,More than a Mall,"If you're going to visit a shopping mall with nationally known brands (middle-high end retailers) then this is the place to go. Most mall experiences can give anyone a headache, how nice to have an outdoor pedestrian mall like this with fountains, benches, and music.It's a kitschy environment with the mix of architectural styles, but the people watching is A plus & it backs right onto the Farmers Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookala

40,Decent shops - Smaller than exprcted,This is a beautiful outdoor Mall in LA. We were however surprised how small the area is and with the majority of shops being relatively high end there isn't the best range for family shopping. We had been told that this is the best place for celebrity spotting but unfortunately no luck! It's a nice place to go for an hour or two but if your schedule is jam packed it wouldn't hurt to leave this out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda4471
50,Outdoor Mall,"The Grove is located in what I call the La Brea area in Los Angeles.Stroll through the Grove for an outdoor mall experience and possible star sighting. Parking at the Grove is plentiful and easily accessible. The Grove has all the standard national 'mall' stores and eating places. I recommend walking around the Grove, but eating uniques eats at the farmers market.The Original Farmers Market is located right next to the Grove and is worth a visit. I recommend walking up and down all the aisles before making your food decisions. There is a lot to choose from. We had delicious dinner food from:Nonna's Empanadas- delicious empanadas, all different flavor and filling combos.The Gumbo Pot- true New Orleans cooking. We had the Rice and Beans and the Jambalaya. Both delicious.I recommend walking around this gem and checking out all the different food places and quirky stores. We absolutely loved our two choices and would eat at either place again.The Grove is always a pleasant experience on a nice day. It is all outdoors so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshochet

40,Great place to visit at night,Yes this is a shopping mall and the shops are your standard shopping mall major retailers however this is a nice place to visit at night just to take in the lights and experience the crowds of people if nothing else. It is attached to LA's farmers market with its unique small restaurants and shops. Check that out if you are there around a meal time or just for a snack. There should be something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Offthecouch65
40,Don't get it,I saw all the reviews and expected to spend hours here with dozens of shops. Most were stores like the Gap that can be found anywhere. We ended spending our time at the Farmers Market which was a far less vanilla experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6632KZdavidc
50,A Cultural Experience,"The Grove takes ""Shopping"" to a new level. It's a ""Destination,"" not just a quick trip to the Mall with a mission to Buy something. Even people who dislike shopping relax, take in the open air, & find things they like ~ such as the fountains, pond, people watching, restaurants, food kiosks, ice cream & other treats.The Trolley brought a Jazz Band to the Stage, great entertainment.The grassy Parklike area with complimentary blankets & sometimes music is the icing on the cake.The Farmers Market was a highlight.I think the main thing that makes The Grove stand out is that it's also a Cultural experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanEvan

Great way to get you in the holiday spirit! Many shops and restaurants to,sample plus the holiday mart a hidden gem Can't wait to go back next for the 2017 holidays.

50,"Great little place, definitely worth a visit!","On first glance the Grove seems to be nothing but a few shops but don't be put off as it's a great little place to eat, have a drink, shop at the Farmer's Market, chill out on the lawn to watch a band and so on. It also has a massive Barnes & Noble if books are your thing. For kids (and big kids) the little tram is really cute too, as are the dancing fountains. Getting there can be a bind if you hit the wrong time of day but it's defo worth trying to see it if you can. It's easy for Ubers as there's a ""concierge"" section right at the front for drop offs and collects. We went three times whilst in LA and would thoroughly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheesecake0509
40,Farmers Market is highlight,"For the most part the Grove is fake street, complete with trolley car, nicely done with the standard and more affordable shopping mall stores, including a large Barnes and Noble. It is refreshing change from a real LA street and therefore quite popular and relaxing. The diamond in the crown is the original Farmers market which has numerous food and market stalls, small shops and a few bars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grommet22
50,Fun Shopping and Dining Next to Farmer's Market,Outstanding shopping and dining area next to The Farmer's Market and near CBS Television City. Offers both large department stores and specialty retailers. Fun place to see for a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
40,The hangout,"I go there all the time, great place to just get together with friends. They have a lot of mini restaurants and stores to go window shopping. They have a two floor Apple Store and three floor Nike store, my favorites. If you go, you should get ice cream, they sell really good ice cream at The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephengV9078KB
40,American Girl!,"We visited The Grove because we knew the American Girl store was there, and my daughter is really into American Girl. However, what we discovered was, this place is a haven for those looking to shop on an upscale level.While we didn't break the bank checking into the big budget stores, we thoroughly enjoyed walking around and browsing a bit. On a casual day, one could easily kill a couple of hours.Parking is a bit pricey, and there weren't many places to grab a bite within the walking area, but you could certainly grab a treat from the Starbucks--located within the towering Barnes and Noble.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernMama2
50,Great little shopping Mall,"Had some lovely shops, pop up boutiques and best of all Cheese Cake Factory for lunch! Not sure Fisherman's Wharf was our cup of tea but worth a quick look! Tram is cute......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMagoos

50,Perfect spot for everyone!,We visited on a Saturday afternoon as visitors from out of town. What a great find!! Such a cute atmosphere with a great mix of stores both upscale and more reasonable. Lots of great restaurants with a variety of dishes for everyone's tastes. We shopped and ate and ended the day eating ice cream on the grass (sitting on a complimentary blanket) listening to a jazz band! How awesome is that?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermster
50,Grownup Playground,".This is a great place to go to with the family. It has a theme park feeling because the avenues are decorated for (seasonal) holidays. Lots to see and do. Great shopping, great restaurants. Very nice light/fountain display. Fealt at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5167KAkims
50,Nice place for me,"For me I like this kind of places where you can walk and see the shops around, but my daughters they just buy some and they want to go, maybe it was little bit hot at that day, the place is very nice you don't have to go there for shopping, you can go there for walking or for movie theater we didn't watch movie because of my young daughter age, but we set in small garden there for a while then we went.

40,Fun shopping -- and parking tip,Nice variety of stores in a pretty setting. My teen loved the Snapchat Spectacle pop up kiosk. We learned you can try these sunglasses for free by visiting the Concierge desk and leaving your license and a credit card imprint. Nice way to try them out. We also loved visiting Sprinkles cupcakes before going back to the parking garage.Better bargain parking at the Farmers Market area (instead of Grove garage) and making a small purchase to get it validated. Disappointed paying $7 to park in Grove lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
50,Great shopping with a great atmosphere,I loved this shopping area! It was very clean and safe. It has a great atmosphere and beautiful landscape!

The highlight is the farmers market which even though is pricey is pretty good. Nice place to spend 1 or 2 hours at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler
50,GRRRROVE! A MUST in LA,"My favorite place for people watching, shopping and pure fun for all ages. Besides, being a beautiful outdoor park/mall with amazing stores and boutiques, I love that there still is a real live book store, which is an oasis to sit indoor or out and watch the beautiful people of which Los Angeles is famous for. The fountains are smashing and the parking superfluous. The sun always shines at the Grove and so will you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenshiG
50,The Grove is Great!,"Loved this place, had so many amazing shops and markets to look at! Eating was great, so much to choose from!!

10,Live music meant it was a nightmare for children staying. Beware,"We booked three rooms at the Grove Arms several weeks before our visit. At no time did the landlady tell us that a live rock band was booked for that evening - immediately below the bedrooms. We were promised the music would be finished by 11pm but it was still going strong at midnight and four visits downstairs to complain were needed. Accommodation is basic and, at £205 for the four of us for a night, felt like very bad value and a very poor experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwhitters
50,Loved it!,"The Grove is what I pictured all of Hollywood looked like: bright, clean, polished, friendly... obviously after spending time around LA I realized that it wasn't exactly true. The Grove, though, IS all of those things! It was a really relaxing place to spend an afternoon shopping and eating. If you have the time, it's worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apfeiffer54
50,Great food places,Loved the buzz of this place - lots of interesting food stalls - we had a great lunch. Liked the history of this place too. Easy parking. Good stop between Hollywood hills and Rodeo Drive area. Don't be put off by the big new mall this place which is next door has more character and originality - a real gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyandSarahG
50,Food for EVERY taste and more!,I learned about this place from a Los Angeles tour guide. The Grove is like the fanciest Farmer's Market you have ever experienced!!! If you can't find something delicious to eat here you need to learn how to cook. My favorite was a kiosk (restaurant stand) almost directly in the center of the many isles of food kiosks. It served (Washington state shipped) fried oysters that were off the hook literally and figuratively!!! I am a fried oysters fanatic and have ordered them at 40 plus restaurants but these fried oysters had me in culinary heaven!!! Besides this kiosk there are many others serving food from almost every culture. But if you want to stick with American fare there were a couple of kiosks serving grilled or baked chicken which my teenage son loved. There was also a fudge place that had rocky road fudge with lots of marshmellows inside which I couldn't pass up.There are lots of outdoor tables here some in the shade and some in the sun. There are also some cool souvenir stores here and a sticker store with every sticker imaginable. I will be returning to CA this summer and I will probably want to eat at The Grove everyday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247
50,Awesome mall,"As far as attractions and shopping venues go, this one is a treasure, providing the weather is good - its predominately an outdoor venue - in LA, so it's usually always good! Outdoor, great selection of shops, entertainment and eateries leading into a very pleasant day without the usual feeling of being hemmed into a windowless indoor world. Plus it has a farmers market just near by, supermarkets and large chain variety stores a stones throw away. It's all good in the hood: five big stars with one caveat...good weather!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrense
30,It was okay.,"If you're staying around here then it would be good to visit. If you have a spare afternoon you can get some dinner at the Farmer's Market which is perhaps more affordable than the other eateries. I found many things overpriced here (the market itself - fruits, vegetables were seriously overpriced... you might want to pop along to Trader Joe's across the Car Park but even then the produce is still pricey). I also found the people to be quite shallow, perhaps more than anywhere else in L.A. The shopping is quite meh. I wasn't impressed at all. It's not a 'landmark to visit' just somewhere to go if you have a few spare hours and want to eat somewhere new. It's also a lot smaller than you might think. The only good thing about this place is the Barnes and Noble or whatever it's called and the cheap-ish food at the Farmer's Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londonistania
30,If you don't have much time in LA don't visit here,"We decided to get dropped here and really the only highlight was the American girl shop, don't get me wrong the place is beautiful with lots of shopping. But we should of spent our time doing something else instead of going to the shopping complexes. We didn't stay long. It's nice to see but if your only in LA for a short time utilise your time elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kazagodfrey
50,Amazing Place!,"Must visit when you are in LA. Attached to the Farmers market, perfect for a whole day outing. The grove has a good collection of shopping , food and fun. There is also a small area where they give out free blankets to use/ lie on the grass. The fountains are fun to watch. Great place to be on a nice summer afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suddu85
40,Nice Outdoor Shopping Mall,"Nice outdoor shopping mall with fountains and semi-fancy restaurants. There is a movie theater, Anthropologie, Barnes and Noble, Nike, and other stores. The Farmer's Market is adjacent to the Grove. I actually like the Farmer's Market more than the Grove because the Farmer's Market offers lots of interesting food selections and has a much less fancier atmosphere. Overall a good experience, but be sure to get your parking validated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ogau2015
50,Must see!,"I loved the atmosphere in this place, people are relaxed coming to have fun, couples, families, shoppers, a great mix in a small area makes positive vibes reign!Would come as often as possible if I lived in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cew00
40,Need more than 1 day to see it all,"The Grove is located right next to the Farmers Market. It was not too far from our tour of Hollywood. There are many shops and restaurants plus a theater at The Grove and it's a great place for people watching. The entire area has been redone and there is a Whole Foods Market across from The Grove. While walking through the Farmers Market, an ice cream cone sounded good. The place we tried makes their own and it was delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
40,Would be a better place to visit if you're not on a budget,"This is a neat place and beautifully kept. There is a lawn on which some people just lay or congregate, it's dog friendly, and there's plenty to do! Only, most of those things to do, like shop or eat, cost more money than you may want to spend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/femaleboxer
50,Extremely Nice Attraction!!!,"This is an upscale outdoor mall with a lot of activity! Great place to shop and people watch. It's sort of connected to a farmer's market that we thought was really cool. Actually, I should do a separate review on the market alone. It was full if so much culture. We saw everything from alligator bites to organic juices/smoothies to French inspired cuisine to the selling of fresh uncooked meat. It was an amazing outdoor shopping/dining experience! Being an Atlanta native, we have nothing compared to this...the closest description that we have to this place and it still would be a poor comparison is...a much bettter Atlantic Station with Phipps Mall stores and add Dekalb Farmers market, Krog Street Market, and Ponce City Market all together in one place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickjr2000
50,Beautiful place,"The Grove is really beautiful. You can shop and walk, it's just really nice. I love the American Girl Place for my daughter and the trolley is really fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guisemonz77
40,Nice shopping and relaxation,A nice place for shopping which has many speciality shops. It has cinema theater. Coffee and Ice cream shops are around. You can buy souvenirs and gifts. The Farmers Market is just next to you where you can eat and relax. Car parkings are available. You have to visit this place when visiting Los Angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salshahrani
50,""" LOVELY """,I like the atmosphere there. There are many kinds of restaurants all day long. Prices in the shops is not expensive so you can make a good shopping there and enjoy that lovely place. Like it so much and l am sure I will visit it next time in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twitter2019
40,Weekday stroll,"As visitors from the philippines we were brought to this place cause of the traffic and people were converging for what seems to be protest march around hollywood blvd. The place have nice shops with theatre and nice restaurants. Add to this is what they told us as the original spot - Farmer's market. If you're in the mood for food trip then it's the place to be. Brazilian bbq, corned beef steak, mongolian, etc etc. The place is a meeting of the old and common people's place and the modern and sophisticated ones. I love the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volviven
40,"Nice place to walk, eat and people watching","It's a closed street with stores, restaurants, pretty fountain and a farmers market also very nice to eat Mexican food (and more affordable).If you go there, try get earlier than 11am because it is easier to park (there are paid parking floors). I love to go to Ladureè(French brand since 1845) sit on the outside tables and spend some time watching people moving back and forth. The macaroons are simply gorgeous! You really should try this experience in your life !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertamattar

40,Really nice shops and market,Visited The Grove the other day and was a nice option for an early evening shop and dinner at the market. Amazing and luxurious little shopping mall. Beautiful landscaping and lovely shops. Went to the market there too which had lots of nice food options and a couple of bars. I had a couple of beers at the bar right in the centre of the market and watched the NBA playoff game while my wife did some more shopping. 10 or 12 different beers on offer at that bar. Beer tastings paddle on offer there too. So something there for men who aren't really a fan of shopping. My wife really enjoyed shopping in the beautiful shops too. Overall worth a visit to Grove and glad we went. Only about $10 uber ride from Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nb5555
30,It's your average Mall!,It's just your average outdoor mall with your average chain stores. I'm from Florida and there are dozens just like this one. I did like the dancing fountains and the feature of the towels you could borrow to lay on the grassy area. I found the Farmer's Market next door a lot more interesting. So I would walk to the Market and browse through the stalls for some more interesting food and finds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516wilmar
40,Outdoor shopping area and farmers market,"The Grove was fantastic! A beautiful outside shopping center that includes many eateries and shops. There is even a trolley that you can hop on to take rides around the grove.It is a nice way to spend an afternoon in LA. Shopping, eating, people watching, photo taking.The only downside is the parking garage. It is like a maze driving through there. Seems even a little dangerous with all of the twists and turns. But on a positive note, the valet parking area is amazing! It has the feel of a 4 star hotel lobby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mssuperstar1

50,Terrific mall experience combined with Farmers Market next door,"The unexpected delight of the The Grove and the Original Farmers' Market. Didn't picture the Grove as this at all. Thought it was a run of the mill shopping centre. Were really only going to the Market for lunch coming back from Rodeo Dr. But Wow - loved the atmosphere, the outdoor nature, the tram car, the entertainment, the architecture. The Farmers Market was another great smorgasbord of food delights - even better than the Grand Central Market in Downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR

50,"great place to hang out, eat, shop, cinema","this is one of the best places to hang out in LA, it has lots of places to eat drink, shop ad go to the cinema. its a little pricey but the farmers market attached to it is a little more reasonable. the farmers market has lots of little food stalls to eat in a comunial area and the food there is amazing. the New Orleans food place is particularly brilliant. you cold spend a whole day at the grove just hanging out looking in shops ect. if you have the cash of course. some nice mid ranged price jewelry places here too. also good for celeb spotting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anniemoonpie

50,A fun place to visit all around1,"I know they film various celebrity shows from this location in the heart of LA. So I took the family last Saturday. What a very cool place! Parking is free with validation and they validate for free inside Nordstroms but I'm sure you can find something to buy.I'm a meat eating gun carrying member of society but I tried Vegan Ice Cream and it really was pretty good.You can sit in the park area and the mall provides fresh clean blankets to sit upon and people watch or enjoy snacks and libations.Plenty to eat here. If you want to forgo the lines in the main area, hit the Nordstrom's eBar... It's like Star Bucks but tucked in a corner... busy but not as crowded as the rest of the place and they have good drinks there.Barnes and Noble is pretty amazing as it is 3 stories and they have celebrities in there almost everyday signing their books.They also have a free double-decker trolley that travels the length of this outdoor mall.Overall it is a great place to go and just be or shop. I really enjoyed people watching with my daughter. This place is the epitome of LA Fashion and you will see it all there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricStarcher1974
50,Great timekiller,"Even if you're not trying to shop at any of the stores they have, The Grove is still an amazing place to visit if for no other reason than to experience a well designed shopping center. It's seriously gorgeous. Coming from the east coast/midwest, we have nothing like it there. The landscaping is amazing, you feel like you're in a movie. The shops have something for everyone, from super high upscale brands, to Topshop/Zara, to The Container Store. The area is easy to walk. Even the parking garage entrance is designed like a hotel desk; in fact, I thought it *was* a hotel at first. I even saw a celebrity while I was here. The Grove is a great spot to visit when you come to LA, I recommend it even for non-shoppers. Just come, get an iced tea or something, and sit on a bench for a while. You won't regret it. Parking prices aren't outrageous either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intlV
30,I Hate Going to The Grove! But There's Lots of Good Stuff There.,"It's so busy, the traffic, parking, restaurants, always so crowded. I try to go as little as possible, but it is a cool mall. I like the Farmer's Market there, lots of stores, but nothing really you can't find at other malls. I just hate the crowds, I'd rather go eat at Canter's Deli down the street and shop somewhere else if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddHata
50,Lovely place,"Went here while at lunch at the farmers market on a tour. This beautiful space is where you would hang out for lunch with a friend. Beautiful grounds with lawn, pond, flowers, trees, paved roading, that is quiet and intimate. It was hard to believe we were in the bustling county of Los Angeles. The Nike store was something else- 3 floors of space with areas set up for trialling the merchandise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260raewynr

30,What's the hype about?,"A lot of people rave about this location, but I don't get it.

Love that they have molton brown hand wash and hand lotion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreacV2097NL
10,"Crazy parking, overpriced restaurants, tourist trap","Where do I begin. Took 5 minutes just to get in because pedestrians were streaming across the crosswalk non stop. No Grove staff in sight to direct traffic. The parking structure is like Mr. Toad's Wild ride. One way traps, crazy merging, almost had two accidents. If you get in the exit lane by mistake you are forced to exit, no ""return"" lane. Parking payment is fully automated. Was charged $10 instead of the validated $3.50 rate but no person to argue with. Then the restaurant. $24 for a small plate of pasta and $13 for a cocktail was representative of most of them. Much better places in LA for shopping and dining. Avoid this overpriced, rip off, tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladinks

40,Fun to walk around. Limited store selection. Nice next to Farmers Market,"My 20 something son was looking for pants. Limited selection of stores, and more limited selection of men's stores/men's department. Concept of the Shopping center is similar to others I have been to such as City Place in W. Palm Beach (which is much larger) and Santana Row in San Jose. Restaurants were good. My two favorite features was that the old LA Farmer's market is next door, and fun to walk around, though crowded & that the main entrance for parking is also an official uber drop-off & pick-up location,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310lhl
40,Great place to eat and people watch.,"I had always red about the Grove/ Farmers market and wasn't disappointed. The stores are too pricey for me, but the food and the vendors are wonderful. Husband had a Philly cheese steak and I had an enormous club sandwich. I can't remember the name of the restaurant. If you can't find anything to eat there, well I don't know! There is fish, sandwiches, ice cream, spices, donuts and gobs more. We enjoyed walking around looking at all the stuff. I don't buy 900.00 shoes so the fancy shops are out. There is also a trolly that you can ride. It is a must to visit. We paid 6.00 to park in the garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841marthac

50,Excellent Service,"This was my first time visiting and didn't know what to expect. Traffic in and around the place was very heavy. Plenty of parking in the garage at 2pm on a Saturday.Tip - you have take a circular ramp from level to level (the space counts dont seem accurate) but as you get off ate each level they want you to go right to park, as you approach the level you want you can find open spaces to the immediate left on the short side of the parking garage. Its then a quick walk to the escalators and elevators. On the ground floor you will see the concierge, seating area and bathrooms.Lots of people everywhere and a small trolley to get you from one side to the other. Had trouble finding a place and the security officer was extremely friendly and walked u to the store. Later asked about where to get a validation and the officer did the same thing. THey work very hard to be professional and go above and beyond on the service. Felt like I was a Ritz Carlton. Clean, organized and great staff. Nice selection of stores.If you spend over $250 you can get your parking validated for the day. Other wise the 1st hour is free and only a few places have a validation (Cheese Cake Factory and Movie that I know of).Right next to Farmers market where we had lunch - but not freeway close so it will limit our trips there from Long Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcaldin

50,Amazing!,"Our hotel brochure recommended visiting this place for shopping and it was SUCH a great suggestion because we LOVED this place. It is set as an outdoor shopping centre and has quite a lot of stores including Nordstrom, Nike, and Anthropology to name a few. We visited in December so it was decorated with Christmas trees, lights and even a snow machine in the evening to make it seem like it was snowing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTR15
40,Everything is here,"The Grove is an outdoor shopping center with the trolleys to hop on to get around as it is quite extensive. Movie theaters, the Apple Store, many known department stores, a lot of restaurants to choose from, and situated right next to the farmers market which you can also explore if you have never been there. I like this mall much better than Century City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
40,Shopping!,"This place is awesome. Plenty of parking, they also offer a valet parking if you need that and a concierge too.

30,Congested Shopping Area,"I was in town on a preliminary apartment-hunting trip and stayed a couple nights at various hotels during my weeklong visit to get a feel for various neighborhoods. While staying in Mid-Wilshire/Miracle Mile, my friend (lives in LA) drove me to the Grove/Farmer’s Market. After a little circling (it was a Friday night), she found a spot in the lot on the Farmer’s Market side (where she could get validation).Once inside, we were treated to a Christmas themed show and decorations before heading to Nordstrom. She found some boots on sale she could wear on her impending Christmas trip to visit family in St. Louis.The next night we happened to be in the area on our way to Hollywood. The congestion and traffic was even worse. Welcome to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/th503
30,"Very Crowded, Not That Many Stores","The Grove is very crowded and it's well decorated. There are decent food places around and they are all packed. There is a movie theater and various shops such as Gap and Nike. There isn't as much selection as a typical shopping mall and you can basically finish walking around in an hour or 2.A great thing about The Grove is the parking as the parking structure is huge and it's fairly cheap. Another is its proximity to The Original Farmers Market. It's like a 3-min walk and that place is great. I would guess half of the cars in the parking lot are actually for the farmers market.Overall, I think tourists should check out The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gesogeso
20,I don't get it. It's a small outdoor mall.,"We had always heard about The Grove so we had to check it out. What a bust. It's an outdoor mall, and a small one at that. I related it to Rodeo Drive outlet mall. Several high priced stores with stuff I don't need. The parking garage must also serve the general area because there was no place to park. Drove around for literally 20 minutes JUST TO PARK! The best thing about The Grove was the food court. Great choices and reasonable priced. Being there just before Christmas the place was decorated very nice and even had a Santa's Workshop. Other than that, I don't get it. Way too much traffic and too many uppity locals that have been conned in to believing this is the place to be. Get real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandS1984
50,Clearly LA's most upscale shopping center,"The Grove is adjacent to the iconic Farmers Market and is a modern contrast to the homey historic market and it's collection of lower end stores and common eating places. By contrast, The Grove is a collection of elite establishments, including Nordstrom's, Apple, Coach, Nike, and others among some very nice and swanky restaurants. At Christmas time, it is just wonderful with a great big tree and live entertainment that you can sit on a blanket (provided by The Grove) and enjoy on the grass. Clearly a first class development. The double decker trolley through the Grove gives a nice 3 minute ride from one end into the Farmers Market; it's nice for kids and kids at heart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

50,Nice visit,Such a lovely place with great Christmas decoration and great restaurants.That is a good place to see during your stay in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parisag2016
50,A Must for Shoppers,"This is a really cool one-stop LA shopping plaza. It's an outdoor plaza with plenty of upscale stores, but also a fair amount of reasonably priced options. For teenaged girls they have a Brandy Melville store which was a huge hit and the prices were right. Janie and Jack was a super-cute kid's store with lots of good sales when we were there. It's nice to find unique gifts for the little ones back home. For the younger girls there is an American Girl as well as American Girl Cafe! We lunched at The Cheesecake Factory which has a huge menu and something for everyone. Give Wetzel's Pretzel's a try, it's a big thing in LA. The Grove is also close to the LA Farmer's Market which is definitely worth a walk-through, but is literally all food & beverage stalls. We did see the runner up from America's Next Top Model there, which thrilled my daughter to no end :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferP315
40,Groovy Grove,"A nice outdoor mall with high end stores. LA prices, i.e.: ridiculous, but fun just to window shop.

40,Better than I remember,"We went here 12 months previous to this review and I remember it being pretty good, but for some reason it seems better this time..Nordstrom have some good deals on and there are some good shops and places to sit outside and eat, drink or just relax. They have daily events on so check their website before you go to see what's on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldwide002
50,Lots to see and do. Fun different shopping.,"Loved the chairs outside at the front end with snacking kiosk's and the Farmers Market at the other end and the trolley down through the middle, which was good for me as I had a boot on for a broken toe so I could travel from one end more easily. Nice shops but nothing that you don't see in a shopping mall but the outside nature of it made it much more fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntTink

50,Bustling open Air mall and marketplace,"I was visiting Los Angeles with my friend. We went on a beautiful afternoon in October. The shopping is a blend of upscale clothing stores, restaurants tucked in alleys and an open area with a fountain, pond and small patch of grass for lounging. There was a trolley that ran in a circuit. We missed the farmers market. However, tucked behind the upscale shopping was an old fashioned market with fresh produce, food stalls, tourist items and a vintage Starbucks. I would definitely return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MahinaMaui
40,Dinner and a Movie at the Grove!,The Grove holiday decorations were over the top! We enjoyed the shopping and dining in the Grove shops and had dessert in the nearby Farmers Market. Definitely recommend an evening visit to take in the lights. Parking in the deck was fine. Enjoyed a movie in the Grove theater after dinner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jboyd170
40,A Hip Shopping Center if not a bit confusing,"The Grove is in West Los Angeles near the famed Farmer's Market and CBS Studios. I was there to join friends for dinner at Maggiano's. My mistake was not trying to find a map of the center in advance as it has several lanes that transect it, and trying to find the restaurant took a bit of wandering around.finally, i found where i needed to be going, and it was not in the shopping area, but off on a side street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmckee3730

40,I have watched the Grove evolve and grow since 2012,"I have been coming to the Grove since 2012, I've watched it through its lowest times to its highest times, I have witnessed the morph and transcendence it has gone through with society and it's own community.The Grove has a lot of history behind its flashy brand known shops and restaurants.It is a great place for mostly anyone to visit and explore.The little stands are for sure over priced... but not bad customer service.The Grove hosts many events, which is always exciting. Picnic and movies in their garden patch behind the fountain. Live jazz bands, performances, and a wide array of discovery and entertainment lurks around.You pretty much have everything you need for a nice date, or family trip - a restaurant, the theatre, and an idyllic walk around the block to the farmers market for a cup of tea.I often go on my own, first to Barnes and Nobles, grab about 5 books, sit by the giant windows, Read, people watch, then go back down and get a Freeze from Pressed Juicery , grab a Complimentary blanket by the park area, and lay down read the newspaper and listen to the sounds from nature to kids playing to dogs barking... it's not what you think of it, its what YOU make of it, after all, am I right?Then head to the Farmers Market and make a quick pit stop to Maggies Nutts and stock up on the good stuff.I like the Grove, a lot.I hope you do too, and that my recommendation of advice may aid you in this direction to an invigorating experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieVance

A must if you're in Los Angeles. Will definitely come back again !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weiwei_888_13
40,Love the music they play,"There is a significant mall culture in my country and we are sometimes fondly called ""the mall capital of the world"" and I tend to compare whenever I visit other countries. So far, The Grove is one of my favorites. The vibe of the place is just perfect for families, couples, friends, pets, and even for singles. Stores range from high end designer names to small kiosks selling trinkets and what not's. Food choices also vary depending on your budget but I particularly like the open market area where there are a wide array of choices that would suit everyone's palate. Another thing I enjoyed was the live concert on the grassy area where people are given blankets to sit, lounge, sleep, etc while listening to live music! How cool is that? If you fancy riding on the tram, there is one that goes around the vicinity if you don't mind the queue which can be quite long at times. Free parking is also available which is unheard of in my country so go visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cal_Mariko
10,Gretat place for an afternoon of fun,Went to the Grove for sightseeing and lunch. Has a nice lunchbox Blue Ribbon Sushi and met somecool people at the table next to us.Later we got some red blakes and layer on the grass while listening to live music and having a coffee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalnomadforyou

50,Loved it....like Disneyland for shopping!,"So nice to walk around and people watch and window shop! I partook and did buy something...why not? I needed a new pair of shoes and where else but Nordstrom's. The sun was setting, the trolley made its way around, the fountain and waterscape was lovely. It was great...it is free to get in, but there is a fee for parking that you may be able to have validated...check into it before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci

50,Loved this outdoor market,"This long-time outdoor market also has new shopping next door but don't miss the farmer's market style venue. I liken it to the Texas State Fair Midway. Shops, vendors and restaurants. We ate at a lovely Italian restaurant. It was open air and the food was incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BUTennisLover
50,Perfect for a sunny afternoon stroll!,"My boyfriend and I went there to have a nice afternoon stroll, do a bit of shopping, eat a bit... there is something for everyone.

50,Upscale outdoor mall great place to spend the day.,Have visited several times and find it an exciting spot to be! Numerous upscale restaurants and stores. Parking seems like a hassle and you may have to walk a distance but many stores and restaurants validate your parking so it could end up free. Great place to spend the day if in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyS583
50,Fantastic place to shop!,"The Grove is a really nice place to shop, the atmosphere and architecture are fab. It's smaller than 3rd st promenade but less busy as I feel like less tourists are attracted to it as it isn't near the beach. Definitely recommend spending 1-2 hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abigailalicex
40,Recommended,If you are hungry you are bound to find something great to your liking around the farmers market. Pedestrian friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhymes0102
30,Largish shopping centre with a laid back feel but ultimately ynrewarding,"Pleasant atmosphere, dominated by a ridiculously expensive top shop, good restaurant choice but would rather go to next door farmers market, a team that travels 200m!!! They have tried to make it nice but ultimately nothing that you would want to shop or buy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Woodychester1
40,Bello,"The Grove is a shopping place with high-end stores & restaurants. There is a water fountain that dances with the playing music and a small bridge by the Pacific theater, like a small version of the famous Bellagio fountain. A lot of people gather around this to watch and be entertained. We will certainly come back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lecterit

30,Very touristy...nothing special...a big (and expensive) mall,"It is nice...it is fun...but it is mall.Just itIf you look for outlets, cheap deals, this place is not those.But in a hot day, with your family, having an ice cream, or have lunch in a nice restaurant, it'll be perfect to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409jesusa
40,SPRINKLES CUPCAKES!,"We came here on a tour bus and stayed about an hour. It's a very nice place. We made a b-line for sprinkles cupcakes.So excited! We don't have sprinkles where we live so when I saw sprinkles it was a must!We got 4 for $15, don't care how expensive but I've had much worse for the same price before.We got lemon meringue, red velvet, salted caramel and coffee. Red velvet and coffee are in the fridge waiting to be devoured tonight, they're not gonna know what hit them!Lemon meringue was soooo good! I'm salivating right now. The lemon curd in the centre was perfect and there was a crust under the cake! The marshmallowy frosting was nice, sticky but not too sweet. The salted caramel was delish too! So good.The grove also has cool shops and stalls and a great looking old tram that goes up and back. There's art and a fountain, very cool.I think I'd much rather eat out here than the farmers market if I'd come back. We had horrible food and service at papa jakes and worse, the terrible food cost us $30! Not worth it.Bennetts ice cream was good too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0wi3
40,Glad we came,"Went to visit the Farmers Market as part of a tour of Los Angeles. We wandered next door to the Grove and had a lovely time. It felt very continental.

50,The ladies loved it!,"Not a whole lot of men will tell you that they actually enjoyed spending the day at the mall. that said depending on the day, there are tons of activities, you may catch the tapping of some celebrity show, plenty of places to eat, and you can run into someone famous! My daughter did, she saw a little girl from ""dance moms"" it made her entire trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phdedieu

Lots of authentic and creative goodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdoug19
40,Lovely day out,"Great shopping ,food-cheesecake Factory, Umami burger, movies and entertainment ..all in an open air mall. With the SoCal sunshine and live music ,you can easily spend a few hours at The Grove. All the brands you need, a great grass patch for the kids to run around while you sip your juice and people watch or the family can watch the latest movies at the cinema. American Girl store with its cafe is a great stop for little girls.Visited 4 times during a 2 week stay. The farmers market for a wide range of choices, a must stop when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madamb2013

40,Great Little Shopping Mall with Outdoor Markets,"Great place to spend a few hours especially if you have a layover at LAX. We hired a car and drove there, approximately 25mins. There is parking on site, the first hour is free. Heaps of great shops and restaurants. Nice, safe family environment. This isn't Outlet Shopping but still a great place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlp9202
50,Great place to spend a day,"The grove and farmers market are attached. You can validate your parking ticket and spend two hours or go across the street to Ross dress for less, buy something and park there for three hours. We enjoyed the upstairs outdoor patio at Starbucks, Barnes and noble location. Great Turkey, brie sandwich. But lots of great eats at the market restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJC1919
50,Heart of Los Angeles,"I guess aside from Beverly Hills, this is the next wanna-be place to be. (and i actually prefer grove to bh) with everything i need in the walking vicinity. it feels very relaxing to be at the grove, theres a very big nike store, cheesecake factory, some fashion stores... (refer to their website), parking validations is 1hour. It's also less than 5 mins walk from farmer's market. The grove has different feel/experience during the day and night.. so if you have the time... if you dont, i'd suggest you go over for dinner, and there's some light up in the area.In the vicinity: cvs, whole foods market, ross dress for less, kmart, trader's joe, farmer's market... one department store that sells plastic wares..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asylumescapee
30,Shopping,The American Girl doll store is here so that is why we went. Then we found Little John's Candies. The best fudge and english toffee that you will ever eat in your life. Both of these shops are expensive. The Grove had a nice touristy feel to it and lots of stores. A great shopping outing for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louise619
40,Open air mall,"It is like a small village with open air streets, a small tramway, a beautiful synchronized fountain, a police station (!) and many shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanmouss

50,Bring money,"Totally upscale experience. High end stores, high end people. Fresh eats. The Farmer's Market is attached. Entertainment...it goes on and on. If you're headed to LA, hit the Grove. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imorr55
50,Like hanging out at a little Disneyland...with a huge bookstore!,"I agree with previous reviewers, that this small-ish shopping area is reminiscent of Disneyland -- I wouldn't be surprised if Disney designs were not consciously borrowed. The walking areas are so very manicured and clean (nice little pond and water-dsiplays), the architecture clearly pseudo-art deco -- but somehow, I found it really charming (but then, I really love Disneyland -- and it's free to hang out at the Grove). It's cutesy, but not quite over the top, not for me anyway. There are some higher-end stores, nice restaurants, and it's adjacent to the gentrified Farmer's Market. But most of all, I love the bookstore -- actually a pretty ordinary chain outlet, but huge, and so many of these have closed in LA, that this is the biggest place to browse for books I know of in the general area. So given the pleasant atmosphere, the choice for food, and access to a great place to browse for books -- I'd love to hang out here as much as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914bj
50,Loved shopping here,"The grove is a pleasant ""Disneyesque"" type experience. It's very safe and has a family atmosphere. I loved the Nordstrom's store. My daughter enjoyed all of the jewelry street vendors. We also had a couple of dinners - nothing to rave about and saw a movie. The theatre has very nice extra wide and comfy seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665vickic
50,Great place,"Beautiful place, great shopping. Easy parking and lots of choice for food!! Recommended, especially the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamMason

40,Come during the Christmas season if possible,"The Grove is a good outdoor shopping mall with plenty of good shops, eats and scenery. It's for sure above average and good for the previous mentioned activities.Now, if you can, the best time to go to the grove and the only time throughout the year that my wife and I make the journey is during the christmas season. They do snow in LA every year and it's pretty magical and definitely brings an element of the christmas season that isn't typical in SoCal. So you can go throughout the year and enjoy some outdoor shopping or you can go for the holidays and enjoy something truly different!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessehendon
50,Good choice of stores,"Our recent visit in August 2016, gave us a range of good choices.

40,"Cute Outdoor Mall, But it is a Mall.","If you feel like shopping when in town The Grove (Farmer's Market) is a great place to go. Personally on vacation I can tell you 100 other things to do first, but if you want to shop The Grove has an excellent selection of name brand shops and cool little stores that you may not find elsewhere.It is often crowded and parking is there, but you will be walking a bit. I find both of these things troublesome, but if I were from out of town and needed to get a gift or just take a good walk around a shopping area, this is where I would go.There are some cool little restaurants and Du Pars in near which is a great family dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

50,Always a fun time!,"This is my second trip to LA, and no trip would be complete without a trip to The Grove. We were there on a Saturday, late in the day to evening, so we did not get to the farmer's market, but just a great place to walk around, window shop, and get something to eat. Parking is available and a great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicagogal2014

40,Great shopping mall in Los Angeles!,Outdoor higher end shopping mall with great range of shops and restaurants. A great setting makes this outdoor shopping experience a pleasure to walk around both day and night. Well worth a visit if your in LA. This is one of the best malls the area has to offer. We had a few hours shopping and then enjoyed a great meal at one of the Italian restaurants on site. Plenty parking available at a small charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnT1984
50,Great day @ The Grove,"The Grove has affordable shopping, fun food with high end bars/restaurants as well as a food court. Eat poo boy sandwiches in the food court- amazing. Take the short trolley ride for fun. Get donuts at the donut shop in the food court!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fbmNewJersey
40,To much to take in,"The Grove has everything, honestly I wish we had the market area (fresh produce and meat) near where we live. There are so many places to eat as well. You are sure to please everyone with you. I was not real impressed with the stores. I expected boutiques I guess or something different. But it was defiantly something I would visit again and hope to buy some local produce.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenangrignon
40,Enjoyed The Open Space Shopping And The Ease Of Parking,This shopping area has a nice open feeling with lots of space. Parking is easy and validated if you spend in The Grove.

Love the food area (market) with lots of yummy choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz

30,See and Be Seen,"I came here on a weekday with out of town visitors. We ended up parking by the Farmers Market since I have horrible LA parking anxiety and usually grab the first thing I see.If you have been to Santana Row in San Jose, this shopping center is very similar and just as much of a parking hassle. It's basically upscale shopping and a place to be seen. I am not much of a high end shopper, but this was something I did want to see in LA for the heck of it.There are a decent selection of restaurants and a neat outdoor food court nearby.I was quite amused to simply people watch. I saw quite a few Stepford wives there during the day with the baby stroller to watch a very fancy kid's play on the lawn in the courtyard. I imagined the competitions/conversations about who's husband has the biggest paycheck. I am simply trying to paint a picture of what this place is like on a weekday.Fortunately, we came on a weekday at 10:30 am and quickly secured parking. However, by the time we left at 1 pm the parking lot was insanely crowded. I would recommend avoiding this on a weekend OR get there right when it opens. If you are from out of town, this part of LA is a driving nightmare and take extra caution on the roads.Be careful about the parking and getting your ticket validated or you will end up with an expensive tab. Luckily, my shopping companion had purchased an item at the World Market, so the nice lady at the parking booth let us have the discounted rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
30,Open air shopping,"Keep that on mind if it's HOT. all your favorite stores, piped in music, fun atmosphere, lots of restaurants, validated 2 hour parking.

40,"Great Farmers Market, but go for the total experience!","You just have to visit the famers market. There a at least 50 different places to eat.

Besides the famers market you have a big shopping center with brands like Apple, Abercrombie, Barnes&Noble and Gap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_1985_02
50,SHOP TILL YOU DROP!,My hobby is shopping so this was a treat for me. The place is huge and has something for everyone young and old. The farmers market is on the other end and was delight as well. I will not bore you with all my shopping details. I recommend you just go and enjoy whether you shop or not......you will enjoy the Grove.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658valenciac
50,Best shopping center in LA,We found this a wonderful place to visit.It is an outdoor centre next to the famous farmers market.

This centre was so nice we visited twice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonN412
40,Nice place to shop in LA,"There is a large multi story car park at the Grove with valet and self park. From the self park it's just a short walk down to the shops. The grove is nicely laid out with a fountain and stream in the middle. There are a good range of shops and restaurants. On this visit we went into American Girl,!Barnes and Noble and the Cheesecake Factory. The concierge was really helpful and because of the amount we spent we got our parking refunded. The rest rooms were also very clean. A tram line runs up and down the Grove but I yet to see this run.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
30,Nice but don't go out of your way,"There's no doubt this is an attractive shopping centre, as shopping malls go. It's lovely for a wander and browse, there's a lovely lawn where you can grab blankets and sit and watch the world go by and there are plenty of places to eat, not least at the Farmers Market next door where there are loads of choices.But as shops go, it's all pretty standard stuff with a couple of exceptions. Definitely a more upscale feel but very busy and some snooty shop assistants. Sephora and Brandy Melville in particular were crowded and unpleasant places to browse.If you're passing, definitely pop in for a look-see but I wouldn't go out of your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Telgip

50,Plenty to Do,"This is another place we always seem to stop at while in Los Angeles. We have seen celebrities here, as well as them taping Access Hollywood or whatever in the center. Yo have plenty of shops, movie theatre, and restaurants to choose from. If you stop here on one of those tours, you will be rushed and need to come back. We found this place on one of our first tours and it was hard to eat and get back in time. So plan accordingly to work in the quality time to explore this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel

40,Exceptional place for dining & shopping,"If you want the overall combined experience of extraordinary shopping and food options, the Grove is where it's at.

You can park at either location and get discounted parking with a purchase. The majority of the stores can be found in most any mall near you. I was hoping to get unique LA souvenirs at the carts but I only found one unique cart (United Streets of Art, which has great CA themed wallets, phone cases, magnets, and more--also at the Dolby Theatre). They have a pretty fountain and trolley that circles the area. Not very big so I didn't understand the trolley. Some nice restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
50,Great way to spend ½ a day!,"Very nice way to spend ½ a day! Browse the Farmers Market next door and eat lunch at one of the wonderful vendors then walk over to the Grove and get your shopping fix.

Where can you find a vintage soda stand with so many sodas that I remember as a child. They, also, have upscale shopping and kiosks throughout The Grove. My favorite part is the lawn where you can grab a blanket and watch the people walking by; eat a lunch or snack. With a unique water fountain, music, walkway areas that are for pedestrian and dogs only, it is worthwhile to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katork

40,Quite surprisingly romantic,"My partner and I were actually in search of the nearest Cheesecake Factory for dinner, the closest one was situated at The Grove. We arrived near dusk and found parking to be relatively easy.The Grove is predominantly outdoor shopping, almost like a piazza. There is a big fountain in the middle with water feature which plays to music and LED lighting. Quite grande, (and teetering on the edge of corny!) but we actually really enjoyed it.We went in mid April, and it got quite cold later on, so make sure you bring a jacket!Also the Nike store is a must for anyone interested in activewear, with 3 levels of activewear! If you come to the Grove for dinner I would advise 2-3 hours is a nice leisurely dinner. If you intend to shop first, give it 3-4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisanL9034VO
50,Very nice! A lot of shops and close to Farmers Market!,THere are many shops and places to eat. My favorite places were Sprinkles for cupcakes and Dylan's Candy Bar because I have a sweet tooth.

40,Must Visit,"I read an article that this is one of the must visit when you are in LA and that article is so right. The multi level parking building is a huge one and at the ground floor seems to have a reception area for pa hotel since the toilet is a fancy one, with cotton hand towels provided instead of the usual paper napkins.The Grove's layout is a what a shopping center should be since I come from the land where we have more humongous and boxy malls than parks. The fountain was a nice photo back drop during dusk when its lighted while the well manicured multi purpose area where weary or bored husbands can sit and relax was a thoughtful feature. Tired of walking? There is a well maintained tram complete with shiny bronze trimmings that shoppers or visitors can ride in for free.With numerous security roaming around and a police car stationed on the street between the Grove and the Farmers market, we felt very secure to roam around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albert808

The staff at Apple Store, MK and Coach store was very friendly and attended to my requirements very carefully.

40,Something for Everyone,Second time visiting this shopping area. Never noticed the trolley that rolls through to give a view of the area. Great to shop or people watch!,
50,delightfully family oriented,"i was really happy at how delightfully family oriented it was at ""The Grove"" .Amid the various shops there is a spot where families with tired children can sit on the grass on blankets provided by ""The Grove"" and even games and books for them. There is also a streetcar that is free to ride.",
30,Upscale Shopping with paid parking and farmers market but nothing special,"First time in a mall that parking is not free. Guess i have never been to an upscale mall but there is nothing special. The farmers market is ok, more food vendors than vegetable/fruit vendors. The tacos and burritos were however tasty.",

30,Crowded and what for?,"Had to go to the apple store here and was challenged by all the shoppes and people roaming around. Parking was easy and validated by apple, thank you.

50,Farmers Market is fun,"It's the Grove. It's a giant outdoor mall full of all the types of people you hate in Los Angeles. It's very pretty and super sterile and very Stepford Wives.

50,Spot a celebrity or two,"This is a great place to go. It's certainly the place the stars shop at, so don't be surprised if you see a celebrity or two.A number of the stores are upmarket such as Saks, Michael korrs etc, but there's a top shop and a Zara, so a real mix. An open area with dancing fountains and a tram. Sometime some entertainment. One night I was there they were rehearsing for the dancing with stars finale.The Barnes and Noble often has a celebrity book signing.Great atmosphere, very safe. A place not to miss.Lots of restruants, including a cheese cake factory.At Christmas time the decorations are amazing, biggest outdoor tree I've every seen and snow in California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40

50,My favourite mall in LA,"In my opinion the Grove is the best mall in LA. Everything is outdoors, and it is so fun to walk around on a sunny day. There are fountains, trees and decorations there, and they often have exhibitions for tv shows and movies as well (when we were there, there was a UFO for the X files!). The shops are all really great, from popular chain stores, to smaller athletic stores to the high end brands and everything in between. There are also plenty of great places to eat, but my favourite is the iconic Cheescake Factory.I definitely recommend the Grove to anyone visiting LA, you will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5057LTnicolaf
50,fantastic day out,"We came here during December and the whole place was fully decked out For Christmas. What an amazing place. So many different types of shopping, even my shopping phobic husband enjoyed himself and bagged a few bargains. Plenty of places to stop for refreshments, the Cheesecake factory was our favorite, I wish we had them in Australia. Don't forget to walk down the side streets or you'll miss the hidden treasures. Great photos opportunites while the christmas decorations were up too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71sharonG71
40,Great shops,We stopped here after attending a filming of The Price is Right. I had always heard of The Grove and wanted to check it out. I really enjoyed Topshop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalAnn56
50,Just love it,"Just another shopping/eating district, but the layout is just lovely. Its the fairy lights that get to me each time, just makes for a romantic wander.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishC627
50,While you are at the Farmer Market,It's right there next to the farmers market - actually they sort of merge in a good way! Nice pleasant area to stroll around shopping etc - and the faremers market is right there for food!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brentling
50,"Walking around , lots of people, lots of sales","On a Sunday, lots of people.We were observing the decor of the area , since it was the beginning of Chinese New Year, 2016, the year of Monkey.Nice colours , beautiful flowers.So many people, all dressed up, pretty , I like to people watch.Families, and many dogs !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineMontreal
30,"Lots of shopping, enjoyed the farmers market next door much more!","We came to this part of LA for the farmers market originally and accidentally stumbled upon The Grove next door. The mall is filled with high-end trendy brand stores with just as high prices. Nothing you couldn't find at any other high-end street/mall. The Grove was almost spotless and well presented for Christmas, that being said I found it forced and fake, almost like the movie studios were filming a Christmas special here. Maybe because I'm from a northern climate, I find all the fake snow and Christmas lights on palm trees a bit over the top. There was a large security presence, I'm not sure if this is typical or because a major shooting had happened earlier that day only an hour away? If you enjoy overpriced cookie cutter shopping, visit The Grove, if you're looking for real LA culture skip it and visit the farmers market!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreK933
50,"Great place to shop, see celebraties and to just hang out.","My first time at the grove. Wasn't planning to do any shopping but I did. Very nice, a little crowded but a great time over all. This open/outside shopping mall was fun to experience. Parking was a little hectic though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kibabadgirl
50,Wonderful open air classy shopping mall! A must visit whilst in LA!,"My husband had researched what to do in LA and had found the Grove to be of great intrigue! We therefore booked our accommodation at the Sofitel Beverley Hills. Not quite within walking distance, but 5 minutes by car. We first went there for breakfast on our first morning in LA, and were very pleasantly surprised! We love fresh produce markets and always seek them out when travelling. Although this isn't really a fresh food market, there are a few fresh food stalls here, but mostly cafe's and souvenir shopping at the markets. But then when you walk into the actual shopping precinct, you have every shop a soul would want whilst on holidays. Set in a beautiful open-air environment with water fountain, a green park area with blankets, newspapers and magazine and books for the toddlers to keep one entertained in the evening. It was a delightful balmy evening, not normal for this time of the year I gather, and we meandered through the complex admiring the old tram, the fountain 'show' not to be compared with the one at Bellagio in Las Vegas, although we were told it was designed by the same person! We decided to have dinner at Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill! Divine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoZoMelbourne
30,A nice shopping centre,"The Grove is a nice shopping centre and not much else. You can see the shops anywhere else and there's nothing really unique to offer you except the sunshine.It was nice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mulverinee
50,Great place to spend some time and spend some money,"Such a nice time every time I visit The Grove. I usually go there after landing in LA, and before checking into my hotel. I can do a little shopping and relax on a blanket in the grass. Great for people watching, clean, and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddiea593
50,"Great place to shop, eat and people watch!","Wow - what a place. Almost feels like mainstreet disneyland. So many wonderful stores, well landscaped public areas and plenty of places to eat!

Whatever you choose you cant go wrong and this is a must do in L.A.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyno39

50,Very nice open mall,"We postponed our visit because it was raining a lot. And that is the only disadvantage of an open mall. But the day we visited, it was sunny. And everything was so nice and pleasant! The lake with the bridge invite visitors to take pictures. As we were there on Christmas, the tree was also there for nice pictures.The selection of stores is good too. But the mall itself is the main attraction.By the way, the market just beside was very crowded and we couldn't even buy water to drink because of the huge queues. For families with small children, it's better to bring their own snacks, at least during holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElineLee
50,Beautiful outdoor mall,"There isn't a good variety of stores there to shop, but the atmosphere is relaxed and the grove is beautiful. Make sure to stop by the farmers market to pick up lunch/dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PerryDanese
50,Been many times and still LOVE it!,"I love this place, an outdoor shopping area which makes it tolerable for men heheYou can lap up the sun and still shop!

50,"Amazing place to shop, eat or just chill while on Vacation!","The Grove is one of those places you can spend the day. With shopping, great restaurants and a Farmers Market, there's not much more your are missing. They have a candy shop, a cupcake shop, great stores: Nordstrom, Jcrew! There is also a trolley that will take you for free from one end of the grove to the end, narrating the history and story about the grove. The waterfall has a water dancing show every hour and you can grab a blanket (provided by the grove) and have a picnic while your there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianabS3774RI

50,Great first visit on day we landed in USA,"We arrived here after driving close to our accommodation but needing to fill in time before checkin. We had a coffee & snack at Barnes & Noble, and then wandered around this beautiful place with great atmosphere, music, shops and a great water feature. At the time we were there it was still Holiday season so there was a gigantic Christmas Tree and Santa's workshop. Some great shops, mostly chain stores, and some cafes. Also Cheesecake Factory. So close to the Original Famers Market, a must-see if you're here. Overall a really great time that us weary Aussie travellers enjoyed with 4 kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/superj1978
40,Ok for tourists,"Just want to say, this is not a place for locals. I am a local and I came here with my family and man, it was a big surprise. People we taking pictures with a normal bmw sedan on display. I am 100% sure there were nicer cars in the garage. Not that the mall itself was not fun but tourists with their selfie sticks kind of bugs locals so they don't go. If you want some great food and shopping it's worth a visit but if you are in to the insider local stuff don't go. Not to mention there are plenty of less touristy more local places with better food and shopping. This is made for tourists (not a bad thing just saying it is not for insiders and authentic Los Angeles travelers)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lngtraveler123
40,Nice little outdoor mall,It's a nice little outdoor mall and movie theater. It's cool they have blankets you can check out to lounge on the small grassy area. Kind of a small mall but if you do this & the Farmer's market it works out well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovecruising04
50,Excellent place for food & shopping....,"Loved ""The Grove"". Lots of upscale options for food & shopping. It also has a cinema......Has a few options for kids like the tram ride and the fountain.....The farmers market is just next to he mall.... It has lots of eateries, fruit, meat and other boutique stores......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdebasis
50,A must visit,"The Grove was a great place to visit, with the movie theater and shops. The Farmer's Market blew our minds with all the food selections that were available. We toured the whole place on this visit but plan to go back to see individual things and stores. The stores were high end and beautiful, but disappointing with their bathroom facilities. You would think with as much people as they have visiting the place they would have more restroom stalls. There were 3 stalls for the women in the places we went to like the Cheesecake Factory for example. So there was a line to wait of course. Other than that, lots of things to see if only just sight seeing and not shopping. We did ride the trolley and that was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686ruthh686
50,Awesome Mall!,"I love The Grove! It has many nice shops, restaurants, is next to the Farmer's Market and it is so lively! You can actually spend an entire day here! It's nice to come during the holidays when it is decorated. They usually have a good band playing for the lighting of the tree. Last time I went a few years ago, Hall and Oates played and I love their songs!!! There are lots of parking in the garage and you can get your ticket validated, but make sure you pay before you go back to your car. My kids have not come here yet and I look forward to taking them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBDoll619
50,Excellent Shopping Experience,Lots of choices for shopping. It's an interesting outdoor mall to walk around and take in all the sights. We were lucky to be here during the Christmas season at night and the decorations and lights are absolutely over the top amazing. Lots of choices of great places to eat too. The entire area had a wonderful feel and we can't wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborahjune
40,Enjoy the view from the top of the parking garage,"My favorite part of the Grove isn't actually in the mall - it's the parking structure. If you go to the top floor, you can enjoy a 360 degree view of the city, Hollywood Hills, and the shopping area below.As for the Grove itself, I didn't notice any stores that you can't find at most other malls, but the walking area is quite nice and often has decorations throughout the year. And definitely check out the adjacent Farmers Market while you are there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniko8
30,high end stores - bring your high limit credit cards,"a nice area, great farmer's market and places to eat in the market, but the grove area is expensive - high end shops and eateries. bring your cash or credit cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ferdferd

40,"Shopping, Cinemas, restaurants and Farmers market","Always a good stop when in LA, Nordstams and also movie cinemas if you want to kill a few hours if you have a late flight home. The restaurants are always good and its nice to sit in one near the Fountain area, shame the one we always go to was closed for refurb. It was Halloween so it was great to see the centre decorated for the holiday and also to people watch while having a late lunch all dressed in their outfits. Also they were putting up the big real Christmas tree at the time and the smell was amazing as was seeing how the tree goes up . Well worth the bus trip or cab trip, also don't forget to go next to the Farmers Markets as well, great food and fruit and vegetables as well as other souvenirs etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheryll
40,"Great design, higher end stores, restaurants and kiosks that are furnished as such.","Great design, higher end stores, restaurants and kiosks that are furnished as such, great parking with complimentary valet on purchases, access to the Farmers Market stores and beautiful theme based decorations during Christmas and Thanksgiving - the only downside is access. It can take a while to get in and out during peak hours, but then again - what do you expect in LA but congestion?Whether shopping, dining, walking around or simply spending a lazy Sunday just wasting time buying things I don't need - I must admit, I like the Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HutchinLA
40,Nice Mall,The mall is really nice given that you are able to walk around outside and that the shops focus around a central plaza with a cool water feature. Heaps of different shops and food options around and worth a visit if you have a few days in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whijo598
50,Exhausted after a day of hectic touring... come unwind here...,"The Grove is a beautiful outdoor space designed by the same landscape artists that design the outdoor spaces at Disney World and Disney Land. This is a glorified outdoor mall with ALL the extras. Musical fountains, plush movie theaters and a free outdoor trolley to amuse young and old alike as well as some trendy boutiques and the flagship store is Nordstroms. There are wonderful places to dine as well as places to grab a quick snack like ice cream, cupcakes and of course an Iced Blended at Coffee Bean. IF you aren't too drained make your way to the very end of The Grove and you will discover the age old LA Farmers Market. This place an incredible food court you will have to explore this place... It is truly a hidden gem. Don't forget to look up as you park your car in the i=covered parking- check out the crystal chandeliers on every floor and the view... simply breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valleym
30,Had greater expectations,"This place was ok. It certainly is not a must visit place for me but if you are in the vicinity and want to do some shopping, walk around, have some food, catch a movie, it's not too bad a place to hang out.One thing which I really liked was Sprinkles Cupcakes. They were the absolute best! You have to try it if you haven't. It's a very small shop located near the Concierge counter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyny_tt
40,Great space to eat and shop,"We were really lucky to rent an apartment very close to The Grove for our trip . This is a lovely open space with an interesting grouping of shops ,vendors and restaurants. And the Farmers Market adds that final element that sets it apart from other malls and shopping areas . We loved the Barnes and Noble and spent hours there . Their Cafe serves Starbucks goodies as well as other treats and I had a delicious veggie pizza there whilst reflecting on my many purchases !! The Grove is definitely worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimDomi
50,My new favorite shopping place in LA!,"Truly folks this is the BEST place to shop while in LA. SoCal has so many great shopping centers but this one takes the cake. Excellent stores, A Nordstrom, my favorite, and great restaurants including Cheesecake Factory. Excellent parking and the chance to taste the international foods at the Original Farmer's Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
30,Nice Enough,"Great shops.Plenty of walking so wear comfy shoes.Nice restaurants in the complex.Service in some of the stores is severely unpleasant, snooty & downright rude (Barney's Co-Op).Around the holiday season I do appreciate the décor. Garage parking is a breeze (a rarity for LA shopping centers) some of the stores will validate your parking pass with a purchase (The Gap). There are so many more shopping options & restaurants in close proximity to The Grove, which makes the trip here worthwhile.Can't leave The Grove without hitting Nordstrom it's one of the best locations I've experienced.~Christy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xty314
50,LA's Trendy Shops,Good place to visit in LA apart from Beverly Hills or Rodeo Drive. The farmer's market is the best thing about The Grove. Outdoors so it can be cold at night. Good choice of restaurants but I did not try sit-in dining. Did some shopping and good selection of stores from average to high end. The people watching opportunities are endless here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erinh913
40,Hop on the Trolley!,"Busy but fun place for the kiddos and I to go for the afternoon. We enjoyed the huge Barnes and Noble.

( I did have a brief conversation with Justin Bieber in the Starbucks line inside Barnes and Nobel )The stores are the same as you can find in a dozen other shopping venues. The restaurants are fine, but it's a lot more fun to go across to the Farmers Market for fun eating in their food stalls. Go for the ""Hollywood"" experience, if you must just to say that you have been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDave
50,Dazzling and Dashing at Xmas Time!,Love the location of The Grove. Lots of good eateries and stores. All my favourite stores in one location. Duck next door to the Farmers Market too for further variety! Really enjoyed the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill for lunch. Could have stayed for hours but lots of Xmas shopping to do. Lots of families here to enjoy the Xmas festivities and Xmas lights. Really beautiful at night! Do yourself a favour and take the family! Shop 'til you drop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edb_merry
50,Excellent!,I went shopping at The Grove in LA last month while I was on holidays. It was excellent! Brilliant shops and a wonderful atmosphere and very pretty place.

This is a must to shop at if you are in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAT2701
50,Great place to visit,Los Angeles is not a walking city. So you rely on pockets of community. The Grove and attached to it is The Farmers Market. The Farmers Market part of Hollywood History. People watching is the norm here. An eclectic crowd peoples this place. Good shopping and the best place in Los Angeles to get a holiday feel at Christmas. But good all the time. A Los Angeles must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonwsimmons

30,Didn't quite live up to the hype,"We had a short stay in LA and I'd heard a lot about The Grove but had never been. I had visions of my wife and I spending all day here and tried to find a hotel nearby so we could walk and return the next day if we wanted. We stayed about 6 miles away in downtown LA. After we arrived, we went directly here. While the atmosphere is quaint, we walked the whole area in a short time and most of the stores were too expensive. The average price of a shirt in the J Crew Men's Shop (probably the most affordable place I would shop at) was $70.00. We ate, walked around, did some window shopping, and left after about 4 hours having only purchased 1 thing. Probably a good place to visit once just to see it, but I don't know that I would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffmX7811OR

30,"Outdoor shopping, a little underwhelming","We were on a hop-on, hop-off tour of L.A. and we got off at the Grove/Farmers Market to do some shopping and catch a bite to eat. Even though there were several maps inside the shopping area, we kept getting turned around and lost. It was a Saturday afternoon and was completely packed.This was one of my top places to visit in the area and I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe it was because there were so many people but I felt like we walked quite a bit without seeing a lot. We'll have to give it another shot on a future trip when there are not as many people around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worknschoolmom23

50,An iconic dichotomy.,"Well I grew up here when it was only the Farmers Market. Thankfully that is left intact and much the same as it has been for decades. ""The Grove"" added to the property is totally different. Upscale stores, restaurants, theaters, all in an award winning outdoor mall setting. Two totally different experiences on a few acres of land. If you visit, just try to imagine how it all started. A bunch of farmers coming here to sell their produce. If you are hungry I totally recommend going to the old ""farmers market' area. Mom and pop stores that have been here, some for decades. If you are on a company budget, stressed for time, go for the 'upscale' in the Grove. The holidays are a special treat as the whole Grove is awesomely decorated and grandly lit at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49
30,Requested by Teenager,"If visiting from out of town, I don't think it's worth a visit as standalone. The 3rd St Promenade in Santa Monica will suffice if you are looking for good outdoor shopping. I was okay with going because we combined with farmer's market for dinner (next door). We were able to cover both over 1.5-2 hours, but weren't really shopping. My teenage niece wanted to go. It was fine for an evening activity that got started around 6:30pm. I imagine it's nicely decorated for the holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MHATW
40,Farmers Markets,"We were on a hop-on, hop-off tour of L.A. and we got off at the Grove just to go to the Farmers Markets. We had great sandwiches and we weren't disappointed. Walked around the markets and bought some fresh produce. Lovely place to stop for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4444Anna4444

40,Great place to shop!!,"We strolled through The Grove on our way to the Farmer's Market. What a wonderful place to spend a couple of hours in the sunshine!! The store selection was perfect for us. It has some higher end stores, along with stores we don't usually see in Ft. Lauderdale (i.e., Dylan's Candy Bar.) It doesn't take too long to get through The Grove, but spending a leisurely day here is perfect! They even have a trolley to get you from one end to the other.

30,LA's Take on a Main Street,"Had five hours to kill between meetings and thought this would be a good place to go. Completely wrong.The good: nice shops. Attached to the Farmers Market. (Hadn't been there since the 80s!)The bad: complete inauthentic experience. The scale is all wrong so everything just towers over the ""Main Street"". There is a trolley which makes no sense. Difficult to find a directory/map.More bad: 20 minutes to exit from Level 3 in the parking lot at 1:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. So poorly designed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthausmann
40,Fun spot to do a little shopping and dining,"It's simply an outdoor mall with high end boutiques and restaurants, like any other upscale mall in America.But, this one is outdoors, and somewhat famous and is frequented by celebrities (You might just encounter one), so it's worth a looksee if you're checking out points of interest in the LA area.We ate at the Cheesecake Factory, which was just like any other Cheesecake Factory, obviously.Check it out if you have time to kill and want to nice little place to talk a walk around and window shop outdoors in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillieEm

40,Still a great place to visit but now missing some stores,"Still a great place to visit and shop but its a shame Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie and Fitch have pulled out. I understand A & F have been closing a lot of stores due to poor sales but not sure this is the case for Victoria's Secret. (unless the rents at The Grove got too high for them)Apple store is still buzzing and worth a visit. Also visited Mac cosmetics to buy a gift for a friend, What is up with the sales staff in some of these stores? Had to interrupt a conversation between two sales staff to get any help. Was then 'served' if you can call it that by a surly unhelpful sales girl. Seems like she was annoyed for invading her space and conversation. Great products but lousy sales staff at this location.Didn't let it spoil my visit though............",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisWaltSnw

The whole outdoor mall thing has always been my favorite! They have plenty of shops to offer and some high end ones as well. I recently visited this past weekend because a friend of mine wanted to do a spur of the moment kind of trip! She had never been to The Grove and I of course had to show her! Did I mention they have a movie theatre too? Well this is great for somebody who would like to get things done all in one. You can literally get some shopping done, eat and catch a movie! Ill Take it! The cool thing about this place is unlike most places in LA the parking is actually reasonable! I don't think we even stayed two hours and the parking was actually free! One reminder is to make sure you pay at one of the little pay kiosk things BEFORE you leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BugattiBoi88
40,The Grove is an alternative shopping experience to the high rise Beverly Centre.,"Walking distance from the Sofitel, We walked there daily for a movie and to enjoy the experience of a shopping centre that is not high rise with an air of the past.

40,One of the better LA shopping districts,"While the stores are often high-end chains, this shopping district does have some nice restaurants.

50,Go for food!,"If you haven't been you'd think this was just another outdoor mall with the usual awesome stores. True, there is a nice variety of stores, like TopShop, Michael Kors, and Dylan's CandyBar, but the real reason to come here is for the marketplace where hundreds of food vendors are set up. Come for breakfast, lunch or dinner (if you are a local you already know you can get groceries here). There is something for everyone. I had real, honest to goodness brasilian fejioda.

40,A good place to spend your evenings,A very happening place in Los Angeles . It is a very good promenade with a lot of branded stores around.

40,Great mall!!!,"This please is really pretty. Open air, lots of meeting places and a stage in the middle of a garden for some summer jams. We arrived here at 4 pm and walked it thoroughly in one hour. The stores and farmers market are nicely decorated and you can enjoy a meal in one of the many restaurants that are near. The bathrooms are super clean and elegant. The only downside is that it's small, so it's not a good option to spend more than a few hours.P.S. Sometimes there are music performances in the center of the mall. There are garden mats in carts near the stage for sitting in the floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarianoN_11

40,THE GROVE MARKET IS WORTH YOUR TIME,"One thing you can do is stroll the grove. While the shops are rather expensive, there is a farmers' market that you just don't want to miss - especially if you are renting an airbnb.

There are plenty of places to eat too. Lots f parking available with good signing on which levels may already be full and elevators.

30,Expensive Stores,"I have heard so much about The Grove/Farmers' Market and was so excited to go there. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it is just a high end outdoor mall. It butted up to the Farmers' Market which was just a bunch of food stands under a tent. There was parking available, but it was really expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylan98
50,Fabulous Place,"Fabulous Place for shopping, dining, entertainment. Right next door to the Farmers Market. There is a quaint tram that ferrys people up & down The Grove. We ate at The Cheese Factory and as it was Friday night there was a band playing live music which was great to sit & listen to. Quite a magical feel with the fairy lights, fountains & music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathryng775
30,Beautiful outdoors mall,"Rather nice place to do some shopping in the afternoon, plenty of places to eat and plenty of places to shop. Can get quite busy especially in the car park however once there relaxing and easy to navigate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386nikb
40,Good mall on the outside,The Grove is an outdoor mall in LA. Its a good alternative to the Beverly Centre and easy to pop down by public transport. Its rather nice to stroll at your leisure in a warm day but it has the usual chain stores and not much in anything funky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
50,Shop!,"Really cool place to visit, shop and sit down for some food. I liked the scenery and the little tram that drives around. It has a great vibe and just a nice place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SentinaS
50,Wish I could have spent more time here,Spent about an hour and half here and the Farmer's Market and would have loved to have spent more time. Awesome outdoor mall and atmosphere. Would definitely recommend coming here during a trip to LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylH396
40,Good Food Mix,Spent the day around L.A. and stopped here for the Farmers Market. When you get there they have a whole lot of restaurants and shops. Great place to eat different varieties or pick up food and kitchen items to take home. Farmers Market has been there for many years and is worth seeing. The new development has some very upscale stores but I enjoyed the Old Section more and will go back when I am in the area. Prices are OK for L.A. and great place for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimK751
40,Good shopping area,"Awesome outdoor mall, had lots of stores and a cool vibe. Wish I had more time there to shop and see what stores were all there. Seemed to be lacking any original stores/boutiques. I like finding places like that when I travel and find them hard to come by now a days, especially at malls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6093NPsarahk
50,Shop drop And eat,"I love the grove it's so magical I feel like it's a Disney version of a shopping mall. Great designer ships got my Uggs and Mk watch from there before then went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner, it was gorgeous Definitely recommend a afternoon shopping trip followed by dinner at the Grove",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nayajl
40,Awesome place to have a nice brunch and more!!!,"Man... The Grove rocks!! They have a permanent farmers like market where you have tons of places to eat!! There are also plenty of organic fruit stands and other goodies for your to choose from. I love that they have several corned beef sandwiches places for me to choose from. I also like that there are several really high end coffee houses here too! Woot-woot!!There are plenty of seating area, but it gets packed so make sure to claim your table quickly and order your food fast!! Best of all, it was cool to see a few people bring their dogs too. Not sure if this is okay, but I did get a few licks from a few paws. LOL :pIf you continue to stroll The Grove, there is a small park with a fountain in the middle, right next to all the shopping mecca right across Michael Kors!! You can also take their really fun trolley train back and forth which is great for the kids and big people too. Definitely great place to visit when you are in Los Angeles!!Until then, Cheers! ~ :p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwin_sfbay
50,Fun Atmosphere,"The Grove has a great atmosphere! Beautiful landscaping, great shops, and just a fun way to spend the day! Don't forget to stop and eat at The Farmer's Market before you stuff your face at The Cheesecake Factory in The Grove :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashlenclaireee
40,Great for people watching,Strolled into the Grove after visiting the Farmers Market and very happy that we did. The place is ideal for sitting on the lawn under a tree and watch the people go about while eating something tasty that you bought in the market.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GameServer
30,Why is this a tourist destination?,"This small mall is very pretty, but honestly, its just a shopping mall. I'm not sure why so many tourists make it a destination. There aren't any stores here you can't find elsewhere. I think shopping on 3rd and Beverly, even La Brea would offer a more uniquely LA experience for the out of town visitor. I can see going to the Farmer's Market for lunch and wandering around sampling some candy and doughnuts. Go for The Farmer's Market, not The Grove. If you want a luxe shopping experience, go to Beverly Hills. If you want uniquely LA, go to 3rd, Beverly, Melrose, or Robertson. Get your nails done somewhere fancy and poke around the boutiques and restaurants there. If you come all the way to LA to eat at The Cheesecake Factory at The Grove, you're doing it wrong. A quick tip though, park at The Farmer's Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmeryM604
30,Outdoor Mall Flare,It's The Grove. An outdoors shopping mall. Is it nice? Yes! But the celebrity hype is what is bringing the draw. There aren't any special stores and it's really not that big. Go to go but honestly you can go to better malls and not pay for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dche85
40,Outdoor shopping at its best,This is a California outdoor shopping center at its best. Lots of great upscale shopping and people watching and the food court offers something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaPeery
50,Amazing shopping and people watching,"Loved the shopping, people watching and they have free blankets if you want to hang out on the beautiful lawns and have a picnic or just enjoy the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786kristine
40,Good place to go to after a day of sighseeing,"a selection of restaurants but did enjoy Farmer's Market most and the book store. Safe, clean area to have a promenade and shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2travel-Mtl
40,Great family day on a Sunday!,"Lots of shopping, treats, entertainment and a farmers market on a Sunday afternoon. They had blankets to put out on the lawn where you could lay and listen to the entertainment or you could sit near the fountain and people watch. They are extremely dog friendly here. It's just like an outdoor mall. The parking garage is pretty awesome, your first hour is free and the longer you are there the more you will pay, unless of course you find a retailer that validates or you spend more than $250, In which case when you get back to the garage you will stand in line to validate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Williamsland
50,a shopping Mall for everyone!,"The Grove is a must see...absolutely beautiful..reminds me a bit of Disney, lovely fountains (its all oudoor) a trolley runs through it...tons of shops, restaurants for every price range (but no fast food here), live entertainment and movie theatre and the famous Farmers Market is attached just behind it...spectacular! not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southamericanexpert
40,"Trendy outdoor shopping and ""Farmers Market""","In LA, this the mall everyone talks about. My fashionista daughter was amped up on the hype of this place (we're from NYC) and unfortunately she was let down by the options. As an outdoor mall it does have everything in the ambiance department - a beautiful lawn with blankets you can use to have a recline or picnic, a trolley to ""nowhere"" which brings you around the place, beautiful fountains and lovely plazas. The stores are nothing special, however; she expected the place to be bigger and better. The restaurant we ate at (La Piazza) was disappointing. There are better options but we didn't research beforehand - as right next door is a little fair-like atmosphere of many stands with cheap eats, sweets, etc.(sort of like Pikes Place or Fanuiel Hall) Apparently the larger restaurant Maggianos is much better than the place we chose. We ended up at La Piazza as I said, due to its ambiance and people-watching status on the plaza in front of the fountain and theatre. Parking is ridiculously expensive for a mall - be forewarned that the validation on parking is good for two hours (no one stated this) unless you spend under 2 hours or $250 total all day please get validated at the $250 level or you're looking at NYC parking garage prices just to shop. Across the street is a Whole Foods and some other places in case that interests you. Do get the map online and see what exactly is there. I liked reading about the history of the place, too; interesting. Apparently if you're into celeb sightings, it is good for that as well. Very pretty environment, well designed, overall you might be impressed if you haven't shopped big cities before - it's a good, fun way to spend an afternoon (but not on the weekends if you don't like crowds!) but my teen boys said it was like Disneyland without the Disney ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugarmagnolia8
30,Just so so,"As an outdoor shopping mall, it has all the items on a checklist: Music fountain, trolley, large outdoor space, and a couple of key anchor stores. However, if your reason here is to do shopping, there is nothing special. Everything is just so so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricklaw7
30,Nothing special here,"I thought from the reviews that The Grove would've been bigger, and better. It was just an average shopping area, that wasn't worth the time It took to get there.There is so much more to do in LA than go shopping at these types of chain stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katsong
50,"Hip, Chic, and a classy place to hang out","This place is GREAT! My husband took me here on our first date 4 years ago, and we have been coming here often ever since. The Grove is chic, trendy, classy - and has something for everyone. We always opt to valet park so we don't have to hassle with parking. Bring your camera's! There is a beautiful water feature that's central to all the shops...You may see some celebrity sighting (hubby bumped into Seal and Heidi Klum when they were an item). I'm oblivious to the ""stars"" - and into my own world when I am there. There is a great Farmer's Market that we enjoy dining at. They have an array of cheap eateries back there. We will also grab take out from Wood Ranch during the summertime when they offer ""movies on the lawn"" - which is soo beautiful, the scenery, background music, everything! I have an awful sweet tooth, so I must make a quick visit to Dylan's Candy Bar and satisfy my craving...other than that, the Farmer's Market offers a fantastic selection of desserts such as ice cream shops, fresh assorted nuts, fudge, bakery goods, etc. The shopping is good - there are a few I like to shop at. This place is safe. We have brought our teens and our baby here. The theater and Cheesecake factory are neighbors so that makes it nice for us to eat and catch a movie. I just love to go here for the ambiance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheleo612
50,It has something for everyone.,"I think this place has something for everyone. It has trendy and fashion stores for shopping, there's also a big Barnes & Noble if you want to get a good book or relax while reading one in the cafeteria upstairs, you can also head to the Farmer's Market where you can get quality and delicious food (a bit expensive, but hey, it's organic). There's an Apple store as well, and also some other well known restaurant where you can eat while enjoying the scenery and the weather. It is not as big as other malls, but I'd still recommend wearing comfortable footwear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardos665
50,Fun,A shopping area with a fun tram. People could lie on the grass and listen to a concert or eat or shop or go to the cinema. There are musical fountains too. Lots of big brand stores. Only con it was very crowded at the weekend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazb25

40,nice place to spend an afternoon,we went here on the Saturday afternoon by bus [ shock horror in la lol ] to escape Hollywood blvd/the tour sellers/cd sellers and anyone else who had been hassleing us ] we got bus 217 outside American apparel store Hollywood blvd and got of at Fairfax ave/3rd street.Nice place to wander about complete different contrast from Hollywood blvd .nice stores and right next door to the farmers market a piece of la history where there were loads of places to eat at cheap places [ abit like an American covent garden ] we also went to the la museum of the holocaust which is a 5 min walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelboy71
50,Great place for a Sunday afternoon.,"I have been wanting to go here for a long time and finally got around to it. I should have done it sooner. The place is much more than just a farmers market although there are produce stands there. It is a shopping center, restaurant row and entertainment venue all rolled into one.Parking is relatively inexpensive too. I think we paid about $2 or so per hour in the parking structure.I'll be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanchoviejo
40,Shopping place in LA,"Grove is the best shopping place where visitors can enjoy shopping, variety of foods and huge gathering like picnic place. Visitors enjoy this place. A special open tram is moving around for visitors to explore this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kausarwali
50,Wonderful place to eat and walk around,"The grove is a great place to go. There is a wonderful farmers market with bunches of stalls of great little food places. I recommend the french crepe place. They have savory and sweet crepes and they are delicious! There is a free trolley that will take you up and down the street. When my husband and I went there a band was performing on a lawn by a dancing fountain and it was really nice. They even handed out red blankets for people to lay/sit on the lawn. There are lots of clothing shops and several coffee places. There is also a movie theater. Tickets are pricey ($14.50 per person), but the theater looked elegant. I recommend a visit for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyBaylor
40,Enjoyable Experience,"The Grove is a beautifully laid out shopping mall. With the perfect weather in LA, it's a great place to offer outdoor shopping. There's plenty of place to eat as well. It's very clean and they have a small grassy area you sit and they will provide blankets. With the sun beaming, they also have tents over head to block the sun. I really enjoyed being there and will go again if I'm ever in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KendraDawnRN
40,Much to see and enjoy at the Grove.,"Having recently learned that the developer responsible for The Grove planned to build a similar development nearby in Carlsbad, I was curious to see for myself what The Grove had to offer. It's essentially a pedestrian friendly outdoor mall that's perfect for SoCal climate and culture. Most of the stores seemed familiar, but there were some unique places and everything was very open and inviting. I liked the way vertical elements were incorporated into the buildings. Lots of dining options, especially when you add the nearby Original Farmer's Market with it's eclectic food choices.It's easy to burn a few hours here, especially if you enjoy shopping or window shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsD6450XZ
50,Love this place,"Always great to shop, hit up mixology or the farmers market. Perhaps one of the best places in LA. I try to stop by here every time I am in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siliconvalleytravel
50,Amazing place to shop eat and watch a movie,Came here a few times in past years but some reason this was the best time of all maybe cause my daughter is older now very clean very picturesque we ate shopped then watched a movie by far our most memorable time while in los angeles and we where all over from venice to carson,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
40,Wonderful place to shop!,"I came specifically to browse the top shop. What a fun hip British store! The groves itself is amazing. So many shops, the farmers market and many places to dine. Glad that I had the experience of shopping here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot

50,A Fantastic Market - Food and Stores (both upscale and eclectic),"Originally we were told to go to this 'market', thinking it would be farm-fresh items and maybe some food booths....We were wrong ! The Grove is mis-named as it should have a better descriptive name to draw in tourists. It's really TWO Sections: One is a super casual and laid-back collection of all sorts of food booths with absolutely great selections and low,low prices. Interspersed there, are various craft and souvenir shops. The Second Section is a complete opposite as you enter into a very modern style stone walkway surrounded by really nice, medium to high-end shops that sell all sorts of merchandise. It's a sort of Rodeo Drive for a more normal consumer, with realistic shopping and price expectations. A visit to Los Angeles, MUST include time to spend at The Grove !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonandMarusia
50,Great outdoor venue!,"This was a pretty cool place to swing on by to walk around. It is right next to the Farmers Market, so you can park in one place and hit both!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zbuxton
40,Great Shopping Experience!,We stopped by the Grove last week as part of our bus tour in Los Angeles. The Grove is located directly next to the Famous Farmers Market near the CBS main offices. The Grove is very nice to walk around as it is outdoors and it has some cool shops and restaurants. This was a nice way to digest our lunch and stroll around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
40,Great place to spend the evening at,This was a surprise...so very nice shopping area with restaurants and a movie theater...there is a lot to do here...came with friends on a beautiful night walked around and enjoy the sights...afterwards we found a restaurant called the whisper lounge and restaurant and had a very enjoyable dining experience....I recommend you take the time and stop here directly across the street you can also walk into the farmers market...you could spend an entire evening walking around here and enjoy yourself....parking even if you have a rental car I don't recommend taking it you be better off using UBER to travel around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/608stephenv

Great place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JakeLewis88
50,When the stars come out to play!,"The Grove is adjacent to the Farmers Market. It is an open-air shopping/dining center, featuring 50 upscale shops, restaurants, movie theatres and offices - area 575,000 square-feet. It has a delightful European ambience. Take a ride on the quaint shiny green and brass trolley plying between the Farmers Market and the Town Square of the Grove. Get a seat on the upper deck to enjoy the view – the trolley ride is free! There are bubbling fountains - there’s a large center park with an animated fountain designed by WET. Its music-fountain show plays every hour. The feature has a non-musical program in between shows. The water's choreography is reminiscent of the Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas—also designed by WET—but on a much smaller scale. There are also Italian pavilions, a beautiful soaring bronze angel , called The Spirit of Los Angeles and sidewalk cafes. They have live shows most often on the grassy area by the fountains. The designer labels present here are Nordstrom, The Gap, Pottery Barn, Abercrombie & Fitch, Banana Republic, J Crew, Nike Goddess, Anthropologie, Barnes & Noble and Crate & Barrel, including a number of smaller, unique shops. a cutting-edge theatre multiplex, and many fine restaurants. The Pacific Theatres a posh 14 screen multiplex at the Grove is a popular place for celeb spotting. Have a meal at one of the seven major restaurants after the movie to spot some stars. Late November each year, they have a special Christmas Tree lighting ceremony to kick off the holiday season. It’s a great time to be there and spend your weekend. Admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
50,A nice break from touring!,"We visited The Grove after a long sunny day of walking and it was much appreciated. The atmosphere is very lively and homey. The area is nicely decorated- there are trees, a grassy area, lights, a pond... Basically, even if you're not a huge shopper, it's still worth a stroll. The shop and restaurant selection is pretty decent, and you also have the Farmer's Market right next door. Consider going if you're in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilincae

40,Because it's The Grove: you MUST GO,"This historic farmer's market and contemporary outdoor shopping ""theater"" presents any group of folks with lots of options.Prowl the market stalls to get the feeling of LA long ago. There are booths there for products and foods you might not want or need, but you will be glad you saw them.The outdoor area with stores is always like a living movie set with decor for the season, color, lights, designs, and many times stage performances.One night we visited, and we ate outside in an Italian restaurant near some fountains. Not far away Jennifer Lopez appeared and sang her heart out.Families were gathered there and when she was done all were so happy. If I were having a down day, I would go here. It is an ""up and away"" type of place.Retail stores, restaurants inside and out, farmers market adjacent.Hint: find the Concierge in the parking garage to be sure your parking ticket is validated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpfraser19

40,Exit and walk down the street,"The grove is good but small. You must go to the Wholefoods shop over the road it's about as LA as it gets. You must them walk down the road there is a Magnolia bakery, a Benefit make up shop and loads of cool independent shops. Further down the road there Is a huge mall with Bloomingdales and loads of other shops. This is all better than the Grove but I only discovered this late on! There is a MAC, Benefit, Bobby Brown and Kiehls at LAX and all tax free. Wish I had waited until then for those. The J Crew at the Grove is great though. I also highly recommend driving to the J Brand Factory outlet I got a £220 pair of jeans for £17!! There is also an American Apparel factory outlet in downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindsbyubhj
40,Nice shops,"A nice area for shopping and continue on to the Farmers Market for ding options. If you daughter is an American Girl fan, you simply must go here.

30,Clean outdoor mall,"This place is right next to the Farmers market and is worth a visit. Very well maintained and clean outdoor mall with a variety of shops, cinema, restaurants and coffee shops.

40,Lots of upscale shopping,"My wife and daughters love browsing the different stores in this outdoor shopping center. Trolley car runs down the middle of it. Nice water fountain. My granddaughter used to love going to the American Girl doll store and check out the clothes for her $100+ doll. Nice Barnes and Noble store to make a purchase and get an extra hour of free parking. The movie theater complex will validate for 4 hours parking in the Grove parking. Right next door to the Farmer's Market, where you can get lunch or dinner for much more reasonable prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidfromLaPalma
30,Why is this a tourist attraction?,"Don't they have malls in other places? Yes, this is a nice, clean outdoor mall.

20,Why all of the hype?,"This is a nice outdoor MALL, but is not worthy of all of the hype. It's over populated with tour buses, not sure why they want this type business as they don't typically spend money, horrible parking. The Farmer's market offers some great, casual dining options. The Grove restaurants have a high turnover, meaning they seems to be changing all of the time. If you are in the area, it's worth it. This is not a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LADouglas
30,Pretty mall but small for the amount of visitors that come through.,"Popular Los Angeles outdoor mall. Nice scenery and some nice shops. Nice way to pass a day or night. Always crowded. If you are looking for a larger more commercial mall, try the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills or the malls in the San Fernando Valley (Glendale Galleria, Sherman oaks or Topanga mall). The Grove is more of a fun tourist attraction than a shopping mall. This mall is similar (but prettier) than the Century City mall which is also just outside of Beverly Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsL455

50,Great place to spend the day with kids and family,"The Grove is a mall that was developed on the grounds of the original Farmers Market. Part of the original market still exists although only the indoor areas - the outdoor markets closed long ago.The Grove is a great place to take kids - there is a trolley that kids can ride for free from one end of the mall to the other. There are movie theaters, places to eat and lots of stores including an American Girl Doll Store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123DRDEAN
40,A great shopping strip,"Went to the Grove after a visit to the Farmers' market, which is right next to the outdoor mall. There is a free tram you can hop on, instead of walking all the way. There are lots of different brands at the Grove, with big stores. Plenty of shopping, but we didnt do any when we were there as there was no sale. There are not many sitting areas for my hubbie to sit while waiting for me to browse through the stores.We ended up in the theatres, watching a movie. The seats were great and there was hardly anyone on a weekday. After the movies, we decided to hop on the tram, but it was only coming every 20-30 minutes, and we ended up walking back to our carpark at the Farmers' market. I hear parking is nightmare at the Grove, so we didnt want to move our car at the market.A great shopping strip to visit if you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikeSweet
50,Who'd have thought?,"I had heard for a while now about the Grove but wasn't really sure what it was all about. It was such a cute area with many shopping places. The small plaza was wonderful during St. Patrick's Day as they had a live Celtic band play. The place was simply adorable, I would love to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mafprincess
50,Small but nice,"Having lived very close to The Grove for years I have frequented this establish countless times. The parking is usually awful, but out of all the places to see a movie my friend and I seem to enjoy the Grove/Cheesecake Factory lunch date combo the most. It is expensive, but we have our routine down to a science. We meet at the Grove, buy our tickets (assigned seating is wonderful!), then we check in at the Cheesecake Factory. I think the longest we've ever waited for a table was 20 minutes - they usually over quote & we get in much quicker. Once we finish our meal it is time for our movie. It works perfectly every time. We also seem to drift into the Apple store quite often & occasionally I'll run to a store for something I need on the way out. I hate shopping, but there is something really nice about being outside & not inside a mall. I'm a bit spoiled because The Grove and Americana at Brand are my regular malls, but for someone who hasn't been to either I think it would be fun to try once. I'm not sure it should be a tourist attraction, the shops are very limited & although the mall is nicer aesthetically I suppose if you are shopping you are probably better off heading to the Beverly Center where they have more selections.One last thing - parking here is STUPID expensive. Make sure you get your validation & you will still probably pay $5 for parking or more.Also, skip the elevators from the parking lot - just go straight to the escalators, unless you have a stroller or a wheelchair. The elevators take forever, they are always packed to the brim & the escalators are really quick & usually not as claustrophobic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielles5
40,We award the Silver Medal to the Grove!!!,We visited the Grove in West Hollywood on a fine sunny day. It was quite crowded...although beautiful shops align the area..it has a relaxing vibe!!! Enjoy!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taekwondo_Family05
40,Fun on a pretty day,"This outdoor/open-air mall is perfect for families or those looking to get some fresh air while shopping. The only problem is parking...remembering where you parked is the biggest issue. Otherwise, it's an excellent atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdkmdm
40,A little overrated,"The Grove was surprisingly small - not that many shops, still - pleasant shopping experience on a nice day. The Farmers Market are probably more suited to locals than tourists because most things are ingredients to take home such as meats, breads etc - not something a traveller really can use. But there is still lots of stalls selling cooked / ready to eat food - definitely worth the visit if you're in town for a few days",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingdove
40,Nice way to spend an evening,We spent an enjoyable evening at the Grove. There were a lot of people milling around. We wanted to have dinner at The Cheese Cake Factory but it would have been an hour wait and we were a bit short on time. I would certainly recommend an afternoon or evening spent at the Grove. I felt it was well worth my time !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayVeeCee1940
50,Great way to spend the afternoon,My husband and I heard about The Grove thanks to Trip Advisor and all of the good reviews. We visited it today (Fri Apr 10) and it was well worth the visit. Lots of stores to window shop and a fountain that plays to music etc. I especially liked 'The Grove' as it had a really great live band playing outdoors. There were plenty of families with small children dancing around to the music. They even had blankets for people to use to sit on so that they could enjoy the music. It was a nice atmosphere! Definitely a great way to spend the afternoon as they had something for everyone. The Cheesecake Factory is nice but same old same old they do validate some of your parking. If you are a 'foodie' I highly recommend the Farmer's Market which has unique food. Parking for the 1st hour is free and the second hour is $4 and 3rd hr is $5.50. I would definitely come back here on my next visit to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malaikak2015
30,Another Typical Mall of chain stores & restaurants,"If I want to eat at Cheesecake Factory & shop at Crate & Barrel and the Apple Store I could stay in DC. I saw online that celebrities shop here - I don't believe it unless they're has-beens desperate to be noticed. Crowded, touristy, overpriced. The one thing that WAS interesting was the Farmer's Market where there's a cluster of local eateries - a vintage ice cream place, a BBQ place - but little else that gave the Grove any degree of distinction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCgogirl
50,Shop...,Came here on the advice of my teen daughter and it was a great choice i might add not sure who had more fun here me or her lol great stores great restaurant options we ate at cheesecake factory mmmm good great scenic fountains and great places to take good photos too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
50,"Great Shops, Cool Fountain in the Center","I loved the Grove. It was on my list of things to see in LA and I thought it wouldn't be possible.It's where the Farmer's Market is, so lots of fresh produce available. There is also a cinema, a Cheesecake Factory, a Veggie Grill, a Barnes and Noble (for book-y people like myself), a A&F, an Apple Store and tonnes more stores.If you are visiting LA try get there once the Sun has set, the fountain in the centre is lit up and music plays around it. It's lovely to see, stand there in the cooling evening and just watch the water shoot up and fall back down for a few minutes.Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaveyCowpar
50,We liked it,We spent a day filming for the Price is Right and we checked out the Grove afterwards for dinner. it is a nice outdoor mall with lots of shops and places to eat. It has a market attached to it that we really loved. Worth checking it out if your in the neighborhood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
50,Really interesting place,"We had heard quite a bit about The Grove so decided to check it out and take a taxi from Hollywood to West Hollywood. Although there isn't a huge amount to do if you're not into shopping, there was still plenty of really interesting things to check out. We ate at the Farmers Market which was excellent, and great if you're trying to save some cash on your trip as well. We also went to the German beer garden which was a great way to relax after walking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328nathand
40,"Excellent low-cost visit, really TWO destinations in one....","This is a newer addition to Los Angeles, a large shopping center, designed like an ""old town main street"" complete with trolley for kids and those who want to ride up and down. There is a nice range of pricier restaurants, but just going with kids is free (excepting parking, which can be validated w purchase). There's a great grassy area in the middle, with dancing-music fountain, play area, food carts etc. Then the general sports stores, Apple stores, LOTS of upscale clothing. One great huge bookstore (biggest in LA?) where you can buy a magazine or something cheap to get parking validated.HOWEVER - at one end, you'll notice the shops sort of end; and there is another section. Old but nicely done, it looks like an old-world market. This is called The Farmers Market, right next to The Grove. THIS is where we Angelinos eat! Tons of great food options, especially culturally deeper ones like Cuban specialties, Chinese, French Crepes etc. It's much more informal and loose, trinket shops, small things here. The place has been here since the 30s/40s? so it's a nice balance to the new/clean/controlled Grove next door. Be sure NOT to miss the Farmer's Market - you can see both for a couple of hours and have a nice LA experience without the madness and artificiality of Hollywood crowds!PARKING NOTE: The Grove has a multi-level parking structure that actually is cool; as you drive up the levels it shows you how many spaces are open. I always go to the upper levels as you can park closest to the elevator/lift which takes everyone into the Grove. Note that this is THE parking for the Grove, excepting valet parking on the far East edge. HOWEVER - if you buy/eat at The Farmer's Market, they will not validate for The Grove structure! So if you plan to eat at Farmers' Market, try to enter and park on the ground-level lot that surrounds the Farmers' Market at the corner of Fairfax and 3rd St. From here you can walk to The Grove as well. Personally, I prefer the experience parking at The Grove (much easier!) getting validated by buying something there, and then walking into the Farmers' Market afterward.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZolarX
30,Hyped up,This is very cute and quaint but not sure what the hype is about. Walked the streets in 20 min. Wasn't into shopping but did eat at maggianos and the farmer market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randos2015
40,Nice day out for shopping and food,This is a nice shopping area with good shops and a good style and vibe to it. Also has a tram that runs through it which is a nice touch for pictures. There is a nice fountain and grass area for you to sit and sometimes events happen there too. It also has the farmers market attached to it towards the bottom so combined it is definitely worth a visit and to get some food too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMysteriousOne
30,completely overhyped,Nice spot to walk around for ten minutes if you are nearby but i wouldn't go out of my way to go there again. An average selection of upmarket shops that seemed overpriced and underwhelming with the customer service. A nice fountain and trolley car to see but not much else. Farmers market is directly next door. Best part of the whole place was the fancy restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avianfluman
30,Smaller than expected,"Lovely weather made this an enjoyable time. I loved the open plan ""village"" experience, so much nicer than the dingy dated Beverly Centre. I just wish there were more shops!

20,"Fountain, Trolley then split!",The Grove is an outdoor mall with chain stores found at upscale malls around the country. There is more interesting shopping on Melrose that I'd suggest you stay long enough to experience the fountain (designed by the same firm as Bellagio in Las Vegas) and take the trolley from start to finish (10 minutes max). But I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaraMHutchins
50,A great shopping precinct - beautiful buildings and a relaxed feel,We went to the Cheesecake Factory and a few stores here. We really liked the relaxed feel of the place not as pretentious as Rodeo Drive. The buildings which have artificial facades look welcoming and very Italian in parts. The fountain is pretty and so are the people. Definitely would go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlDeDiner2019
50,Fabulous Shopping Street,"This is the most unique shopping street you will see anywhere. It's all outside and free of vehicles except for a tram running down the length of the street. On this street you will find an explosion of high end stores, wonderful restaurants, theatres, has a ton of books on Los Angeles, Hollywood, and film making. Park in the attached parkade and get merchants to stap your parking ticket for a parking discount...Spend way more and get parking free. If you are in the neighbourhood don't forget to drop into the Grove...it's a perfect shopping place for people who don't even like to shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brodie52

50,Absolutely love it,"Every trip to the Grove has always been amazing for me. I love the fountain, especially at night when it glows from the lamps. You can just sit or stand on the bridge and enjoy the view. I bet it makes a romantic place. There is also a small garden nearby, which hosted a lot of decorations and events, such as Christmas trees, Easter celebrations, etc.Restaurants are amazing, shops are cute, there is a bookstore and farmer's market nearby. I especially love the theater. It has this old-fashioned neon sign, and the interior was great. It is more expensive than usual theaters, but I feel like it's worth it.I also really like the tram that goes around the place. It's very vintage and cute, especially with the bells signaling people to move away from the rails.I definitely encourage people to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenalim
50,It is it's own little city,"My daughter took me to The Grove on a fairly light Saturday afternoon (her words). We were able to stroll down the walkway without too much interference of others in the shopping center. It does receive a lot of people every day but it is large enough to be able to handle the tourists, sight seers, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m2swim
40,Outdoor mall meets luxury and innovation.,"Very cool spot to come to at night, its very alive, has a lot of stores and some cute restaraunts, also right next to farmers market which offers cheap variety fresh food. Def a place to visit if you are in LA, but the end of the day, its just a mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanroytbak
40,Nice but pricey!,A nice upscale outdoor shopping center to stroll around. It is not particularly big but very busy and plenty too see. Near the middle there are fountains the shoots water periodically. We enjoyed shopping at Barnes & Noble and have a coffee break at the third floor patio overlooking the shopping mall below. This shopping center along with the Farmers Market makes a complete and enjoyable experience especially if you have a lot of money. There's also a trolley that periodically runs through the mall.The parking is can be pricey as well but you can have a 2-hr validation from some merchant. $24 max. What I like to do is park at the Farmers Market and just purchase something from a merchant there to have a 2-hr validation. $4 for the third hour and $1 for each 15 minutes. We spent a total of 4 hours between the Farmers Market and the Grove and paid $8.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainbowCowboy

30,Average mall with limited choices,"I drove long way from downtown to grove, I m happy to see Barnes and nobles with great selection of books. But there are too few shops here as a shopping area. E.g. Nike only got running stuff.However, farmers market is just nearby. That gives this place some credits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxlai_hk
50,Great evening atmosphere,Take a ride on the free trolley and enjoy the people watching. Some lovely lights make it a pretty place to stroll about and a lovely fountain in the middle.

50,A delightful shopping experience,"This shopping district is just gorgeous. Very clean with a lovely atmosphere of manicured gardens and dancing fountains. This is not a shopping outlet, the shops in the Grove are specialty and varied with brands that are both popular and high end. The cinema is beautiful, and the farmers market is big.

ITs just like a very nice outdoor mall with nice stores, techy stores, fancy restaurants and pretty waterfalls and play areas, and oh don't forget the free trolley that takes you up and down the street. Its always a pretty picture spot for tourists. There are beautiful palms trees, restaurants that overlook the whole strip where you can sit outside, people watch while soaking in the beautiful Cali sun. The Apple store is massive and always full to the brim with people asking for help to fix their devices, Barnes and Nobles is 3 stories high and fun to peruse and Cheesecake Factory always has lines out the door. Take some time to enjoy this area, eat or shop before heading out. Parking can be a nightmare but we were so lucky because we came early and found one right in front of the farmer's market.

However, it was extremely crowded for a Sunday afternoon. It took us almost 30 minutes to park in the parking garage. I highly recommend using the valet parking. Also, The Grove and all of the restaurants and eating areas were packed. Very hard to enjoy it to it's fullest. That being said, I have heard that it isn't always that crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzyB818

50,Great experience,"Went to the Grove to visit the American Girl Place for my daughter's 8th birthday. Had time to kill between shopping and dinner reservations. Wish I had known that the farmer's market was more of a place to eat than to shop and take home fresh veggies as we would have had lunch there rather than the greek place right outside (do not recommend that place...greasy and underwhelming). I will definitely go back and check out the farmer's market again. The girls loved the trolley ride, the fountain and the Christmas decorations. Loved Sprinkles cupcakes and had fun shopping different stores in the plaza. Was impressed when I went to the concierge to ask how to validate parking and the attendant noticed my daughter's birthday crown from the American Girl place and went in the back and grabbed a pin for her, too. Very please with The Grove. Girls definitely want to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenm993

I always find that there are crazy deals at the shops which is pleasant. I highly recommend checking The Grove out in both sunshine and at night. We usually have dinner at Marmalade Cafe - very good! There is free wifi throughout the shopping center but sometimes it's shaky and cuts in and out. There is a large paid parking garage on site so keep that in mind while you're there. A must see when visiting the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990christinag

50,Can't ask for more,"Has everything. Name brand shopping, boutique shops in the farmers market, variety of foods from small mom & Pops to chain restaurants. Has ample parking with validation.

50,Good for shopping of all sorts,"All the area surrounding The Grove has very nice shops and restaurants. You can try several kinds of food at the Farmer's Market food court or eat in one of the nice Cafeterias inside the complex (or both) before heading to the stores. They have a giant Christmas Tree and a trolley car.The only problem I found was that the GPS guided me to the front of the building and the parking is on the back. I had a hard time finding a place to park in the front at the Farmer's Market, but later I saw that they have a huge parking building right next to The Grove, and it's free. All surrounding parking lots are very specifically asking clients of The Grove to not park there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShigueS
50,A wonderful Christmas atmosphere,"We loved visiting The Grove as we were staying in Beverly Hills so it wasn't far to get there in the taxi. Such a fantastic atmosphere in the lead up to Christmas. Fabulous retail shops, beautifully decked out, and one of the largest and most comprehensive Barnes and Noble stores. The Farmer's Market and the restaurants surrounding the area are splendid with some great quality food to be found. The French Monsier Marcel restaurant and bar was so delicious and allowed a wide selection of cheeses and meats to make up your own cheese plate. Not bad value at all either, and they also served a range of other delectable menu items for the more hungry diner such as our 14 year old. We loved our time here and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. The shops are beautifully designed and every shop offers a great retail experience. The size of the shops are immense and an experience on their own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myrnavanpelt

50,Fun,"I really recommend the Grove for day 1, if your off the plane and Jetlagged.Its got shops, restaurants, A Movie Theatre,The Farmers Market! Its got a great Buzz, something for everyone, and a good place to even just walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/advani2013
50,"Yes, it snows in L.A. in December","Go to The Grove main fountain area. During the month of December at 7 or 8 p.m. Stand a few meters (or yards) in front of the Crate and Barrel shop. The music over the loudspeakers stops, and suddenly ""White Christmas"" (or ""Let it snow"") begins, and it starts to snow. Children look up in amazement and begin to run around chasing the elusive stuff. Adults are transported back to their own childhoods, when Christmas and snow were intertwined with family and simple joys. Yes, it's a little bit of holiday (and Hollywood) magic, but it evokes a power far beyond that. Go, and capture that Christmas spirit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccvvbb
40,Relaxing place just in downtown,"The atmosphere here is always relaxing and happy, probably caused by the beautiful street, foutain and well-docorated shops. Free 2-hour parking is a great plus. Even not for shopping, you can find pleasure with your family.But the restaurant within the Grove is pricey. We love cheese factory, providing delicious cake and pasta with reasonable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benjamin0723
40,Learned new things on this visit,"I don't visit this mall very often, usually just once a year, the day before Thanksgiving, so my friend's little girl can visit the American girl store, and say hi to Santa Claus.Today was the day before Thanksgiving, and we drove from Orange County to LA, which supposedly is the worst traffic day. We arrived at the mall at 9:45, and the parking structure was practically empty.I had downloaded the Caruso parking app on my phone, because you get two hours of free parking for using the app. Unfortunately, it was not working with the parking entrance. So I grabbed a parking ticket, and decided to go to customer service to deal with this issue.At 10 o'clock, everything was open, and we have complete access to the American girl store. We did our shopping then popped inside the Barnes & Noble's, where I purchased a latte so I could get my parking validated for an extra hour. Then I went to the concierge to do with my Caruso app issue.For the longest time, I thought you had to purchase $250 worth of merchandise at one store to get free parking all day. Well fortunately for me, since I had issues with the Caruso parking app, I was told by the concierge that it was a combined total of $250 from all places shopped at the Grove. My purchase at the American girl was close to $200, then adding some books, lattes, and $30 worth of cupcakes from Sprinkles, I was able to meet the $250. I handed the concierge my receipts, and she gave me a parking pass good for all day!What started off as an error with my app, and it up being a blessing in disguise it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
40,Shopping mall with Extras,"This mall which is iconis by US standards . Nordstrum ,Gap and Apple are some of the significant clients . It is themed with a working cable car. It is right next to a tourist attraction called The farmers market.There is a cinema on site plus a range of restaurants including The Cheesecake Factory and Morels ( worth a try)Overall a good outdoor experience .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowardN598
50,Love it here!,"I have visited The Grove several times, and I always love it. Even if you don't want to go shopping or buy anything, it's just such a pretty area with a lot to look at and always something going on. I haven't been back in a few years and I can't wait until I'm in Los Angeles again so I can visit The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SansaM1
50,Great place to spend time shopping & restaurant,"Many parking, many shops and restaurantsNice outdoor area with free live musicGood to spend time over a weekend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinProdrive
40,Christmas in November!,"The Grove is dressed up for Christmas, and it is looking pretty! Santa in his sleigh is riding through the sky and the big Christmas tree is all lit up, and the smaller trees lit to look like a fairy-land. Magic! Had a great afternoon browsing the shops and finding a few finds! A fun way to spend some time with my sister and niece. Most of the stores are your usual box stores, but a fun afternoon none-the-less! Be forewarned, parking can be pricey!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneH46
30,bit early for Christmas decor,"Yes, I know. Some feel it's never too early for christmas, but the first week of November is too early. For decorations that can go up in a day, give it a rest and how about we compromise on the Wednesday of Thanksgiving. I mean, even Santa doesn't appear at Macy's until Thanksgiving day. Other than that - valet the car and shop away. It's got major stores, cute local retail and even crossing guards to ensure you get across a busy LA street safely. And a trolley car for those who can't walk it end to end. Bargains? Rare. Start sightings? Yes. You might have to run through the rolodex in your head to figure out what TV show or movie they were in, but they're there. And for those of you who don't know what a rolodex is, you're not going to recognize the stars either. They do have a hidden food court that caters to every taste. And it's an outdoor mall. Just go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksondc
40,Great Alternative,"Stayed across the street from the Grove so we visited a few times whilst in the area. The Grove is a pleasant alternative from the big indoor stuffy malls. It nice to go for a walk round and use the tram even if you are not shopping, or go to the movies or to one of the great restaurants.Nice place, would definitely recommend if in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ollowood
40,"Nice area to walk around, shop, or eat.","The Grove is a great area to walk around. There are shops and restaurants, but also nice for just walking. Around holiday season, the Christmas tree is up and lights around The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660ericar

50,Oooh Fancy,I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap the parking was here. I am from a tourist area so $8 really didn't seem like a big deal especially in the middle of LA. Shopping in the footsteps of our favorite celebrities was pretty dang fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7356VQannam
40,A cut above,A fantastic little upmarket shopping area with lovely stores and great places to eat. We liked Bar Verde in Nordstrom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huddlebert
40,Nice ambience,We stayed here for a couple of hours and enjoyed going through the different stores. As most of the shops were high end did not a lot of shopping but it was nice to enjoy great weather.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momSydney
50,Great Place!,We spent a few hours in the afternoon at The Grove. It was beautiful. The outdoor shopping and the awesome water feature in the middle. Its a great way to enjoy the outdoor weather AND get some shopping done. We saw Tim Allen eating lunch outside and another celebrity grabbing her car from Valet. It was pretty cool. Everyone in the stores were nice and helpful (unlike Rodeo Drive) it was just a laid back atmosphere that was clean and beautiful. Loved it! Will go back next time we are in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah1517
40,Beautiful but over-priced,"This was a very beautiful outdoor mall, it was different than most of the others I have been to. I also loved how there was also a movie theater so that you could spend your time there. But the problem was that most of the shops and restaurants are high-end so to me it wasn't very useful because they're overpriced and I felt like I wasted my time but on the other hand, there was a Farmer's Market right next to the grove, which was also great since they have a variety of foods to eat there so you should check that out if going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler60045
50,Makes shopping fun!,"The Grove is a beautiful outdoor shopping mall that is classic California. Many of the shops are familiar national chain stores, but there are also local merchants and eateries that are delightful. It's easy to spend hours at The Grove, so just be sure that your credit card isn't already near the max!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTTravelersRus
20,"Don't bother, spend your valuable holiday time elsewhere","After reading the reviews of praise on Trip Advisor I was lured to The Grove under a false sense that it was something exciting. Please don't be fooled in wasting your time here! One of the rare times reviews have let me down :-(The Farmers Markets were a unique way to grab some lunch although quite over priced and I feel the best offering was butcher shop meat which is no good for holidaymakers... There's a selection of burger shops, some seafood, Asian cuisine and carvery food. Nothing to write home about nor what you can't get elsewhere.The shops at The Grove (felt like there were a very minimal number of) were under stocked and boring. You can walk from one end to the other in under 5 minutes. There is better shopping offered up the road accessible via the Skyline Tours Hop-On, Hop-Off bus.The Cheesecake Factory was a major let down, when you walk in and they can't even get your four-letter name right after asking twice then getting attitude as I was walked to a seat just to order a mere piece of cake. I walked right back out again. Bummer as I was looking forward to tasting their offerings.Don't bother here! Boring and over rated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Petaloo79
50,"Great shopping centre, next to Farmers Market.","Fantastic shopping centre in LA! Loved the fact there was an outdoor area, to enjoy the great LA weather. Lot's of great shops and restaurants, and a very inviting atmosphere, better than an indoor mall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhonda028
30,Crowded on the weekends,"The Skinny:Parking- very large garage, some validation from restaurants/movies, valet availTime: you could easily spend half a day hereBonus: bands on the weekend, fountain mini music and light show during the dayThe Grove is very popular and on the weekend it is crazy busy, wall to wall people. There are many shops - Apple, Crate & Barrel, Anthropologie and tons of restaurants! Plus a movie theater. If you want a cheaper eat, try the Farmers Market with many eateries that are self serve and you can eat at many tables scattered all around the premises. The bathrooms are a bt nicer on the grove side versus the older Farmer Market side. There is also a Dylan's Candy Bar with 1000's of choices of candy before you head into the movies! The Grove isn't that big but they have a trolley that runs back and forth if the kiddies like that sort of thing. Even with parking validation, you will end up paying something for parking - pay at the machines before you go to the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melobeam
50,I love love love the GROVE!!!,"We have to go to the Grove every time we come to LA! It's so awesome! Well, it has everything you want. Shops, movies, restaurants, even an amazing farmer's market with TONS of options for eating. Oh i just love coming here!We came here in Oct and the weather was warm but nice. THey happened to be having a live band performing, and they were excellent. There were free blankets for anyone who wanted them to sit out on the green and watch the band. It was fun and my 16 month old danced the night away. We visited several of the stores - some high end ones and some mall ones. Then we made our way over to the Farmer's Market to eat. Though there are several restaurants at the Grove, I would recommend going to the Farmer's market. There are a lot of options for just about anything you're in the mood for! We've eaten at several places but this time I tried the BBQ Brisket (right at the entrance) and my husband got a French Dip sandwich. Both were delish. We have also tried the brazilian steakhouse which is ALWAYS packed and love it. Also try the juices and fresh fruit, and don't forget the doughnut store for dessert (or your pick of several other bakeries). BTW you do pay for parking but most stores and restaurants validate so remember that. Or else just pay in the parking garage before leaving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Asma3022
40,Great place to mingle,The farmers market has unique delicacies and amazing eateries.The mall and shopping is good for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livehappy01
50,Fantastic open mall,"I really liked The Grove! It has fantastic characteristic in a beautiful environment! The shops are typical like any mall, but somehow this place makes you really want to buy something even if you like not a shopping person (like me). It is like a nice little city center. And the lights in the evening makes it more fairy tale like!If you don't like malls at all, then avoid this place, but if you are not against them, you must see this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgama87
30,Bad service at Pottery Barn,"A colleague of mine on the same trip requested to buy a display item (astronaut helmet) and was told he cannot do so. Crazy as it sounds. The shop manager prides on ""getting to a yes"" as part of their service tagline.We eventually managed to get it but without a box which they claimed they do not have it.The kind concierge Rena finally managed to get it for us and brought it over to Farmer's market and handed it over to us even though she was off work. Kudos Rena!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonQ_13
50,Enjoyable experience,"I always goto the Grove when I visit LA. So many restaurants, many stores, and nice to walk around. There is even a trolley to take you when u need a rest. The Farmers market is a delight, right next door. So many stalls to choose from. And there is valet parking, entertainment, and just a nice way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145adriennea
40,Cute shopping in LA,"This is in my opinion a very cute place to shop in LA. It's not that big, and basically it is a shopping mall spread along a kind of internal street. It seems very much like the main street from a Disney park: it's a street where the shops are placed in both sides, as well as nice restaurants, a cinema, a fountain and even a little train that cross the area.The Italian restaurant and the French Bistro close to the fountain have high quality food. There is also a Cheesecake Factory just at one side of the cinema, offering great cakes but also well prepared simple meals. At the same time, just a walking distance is the Farmer's market, which offers more popular meals and shops with low prices for souvenirs.But in the Grove I can find a Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, Banana Republic shops as well as a Tommy Bahama shop, which are enough to get my interest in visiting the shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuPereira
50,"Love, love, love it","I wish we had a place like this in Australia. It is lovely sitting under the stars whilst watching the dancing fountain, doing some shopping and after a bite to eat you can catch a movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karos1
40,"Great spot. Eat, drink, shop. Oh My",Def one of the best places in LA to grab some food and do some shopping. It can be super touristy but it's not overly annoying. Lots of good stores and tons of good food in Farmers Market. Always a good place to chill and people watch too. Live music and different entertainment things on the green too. Aces. Follow me on Instagram @gma0917,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gma0917
40,farmers mkt is the happening for meals,"every type of ethnic food you can eat is right here. My 2nd time here from S.F. and good food as always. I see people with 3 piece suits on here eating the various food. Also some gift shops, mostly touristy junk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanjosejohn
40,Great Open Air Place,"The Grove is a great place to go if you have some time to kill and nothing to do while in LA. It's an open air mall and the environment is great. They have lots of stores there, ranging from Coach to Barnes and Nobles to Forever 21. If you want quality over price, this would be the place to go because there aren't that many discounts, but if you're looking for cheaper deals, then you'd be better off going to an outlet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandrar479
50,Nice area in LA,"Pretty fountain, good music, great stores, fun atmosphere- What else could you want? For me, FOOD and it was good. The farmers Market had fresh fruit and veggies. I bought some fruit to go. kiwi berries, which I had never had. They had stands for just about everything. Chocolates, dried fruits (I bought the ginger sugared) popcorn, etc. The food choices were overwhelming. I had a choice between Irish, bbque, Japanese, Chinese, Seafood and oysters- well, it was all there. I chose greek. I love greek food- especially gyros but here, I had something that I had never had before a Shawarma. I think that is spelled right. Well, it was very good. I have been to countless greek restaurants but they had side dishes here that I had never tried. They looked very good. The food was amazing and I went to another stand for my drink which was herbal lemonade. Very good.. The lemonade was blended with mint, basil & another herb that I am not remembering but I loved it and this was my first time trying it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duane52
50,Love The Grove!,"The Grove is my favorite mall to browse, people watch and just hang out at. I missed their ""movies in the park"" this summer, but I've enjoyed that as well over the years at The Grove. We did take in an afternoon movie at the cinema located within the mall. Their fountain is beautiful and there is music that plays along with it, like a smaller scale version of the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas. Parking can get to be expensive but many of the shops validate. Keep an eye out for celebrities when you're here. They love this mall too. It's been featured in a number of movies. One that comes to mind is the movie ""I love you man"" with Paul Rudd. The Farmers Market is directly next door and is a great place to shop and eat as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
50,My favorite place in LA,"We've been traveling all over LA county to the typical tourist places (Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, etc.) but The Grove is my favorite. Great shopping, restaurants, fountain, and over all scenery. It's got something for everyone. We ate at Morels and had a great experience, although it was pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madeleinemcaulay
50,Beautiful Open Air Mall!,"The Grove was one of our LA highlights! Parked right next to the farmers market, the grove is beautiful, clean, has lovely music playing as you stroll around, mood lighting, fountains, nice shopping and some nice restaurants and cafes! It was a big relief to get there after being in Hollywood for a while and getting a bit overwhelmed by the dirtiness and hagglers. Nordstroms and MAC were great for a shop! Highly recommend anyone to come for a look if you are looking for a relaxing shop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieRiley
30,Must be better shopping centres around,"I purchased the family night deal that included movies and a 3 course meal. We thought we would get there early and look around but unless you want to buy all designer brands it might be worth going somewhere else. We had our 3 kids and trying to find a movie was impossible, we ended up taking them to the best option available but it really wasn't appropriate for their ages (4 & 9 yr old watching 13 plus movies) , I was disappointed in this as I knew other cinemas were showing great kids movies. If they want to do a promo called family night out, then play sone family movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wadeandnat

40,Great central shopping area,Great shopping in LA. This is a true mall with great common outside walking areas with stores on the perimeter. There are also several restaurants in the shopping area so you can stop for a beverage or lunch. We liked the variety of shops. Not all upscale like Beverley hills. Really enjoyed the farmers market attached to the one end of this area. Good food and shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momheis

40,Fun to visit at night,The Grove is an amazing area with lots of shops and restaurants not far from Hollywood and right next to the Farmer's market. I visited on a Thursday night and it was quite lively with lots of people and all the stores still open. There was a movie playing in the middle of the walkway and some people were spread out on blankets. They have a large movie theater there as well. It would be a fun place to take a date.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imtom55711
30,Not cheap,"Visiting the Grove is not a cheap experience. I'm not talking about the Farmers Market, although I wish they would combine the Grove and Farmers Market parking into ONE parking system. It really sucks that you can't get validation at the FM if you're parked at the Grove structure, and vice versa. If you're spending money, what does it matter? They may be connected, but its 2 different properties!The Grove gives you 2 hours of free parking, but after that the prices sky rocket. Some (not all) of the merchants validate. Barnes and Noble does (at the Starbucks) with any purchase, but All American Girl will after you spend like $250. That's just stupid that they won't validate you for ANY purchase.The parking doesn't start until level 3 and you ""spiral"" your way up to enter, and ""spiral"" your way down to exit. Prepaying your ticket is a MUST before you get into your car to leave. Paying at the exit kiosk will cause more traffic, not to mention fumbling in your car for your credit card.Whoever said living in the big city was fun is dilusional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
40,The Grove a interesting treasure,"This place has a little something for everyone. Sitting a block from the CBS and neighbors with the famed Farmers Market you can enjoy lovely eateries and shops, a dancing fountain, a trolley and a prime movie theater. Want the open market experience ? Visit farmers market which has a little bit of everything from produce to bakeries, teas and alligator meat(yep). Parking can get pricey so make sure you validate(the grove validates their parking and farmers market does theirs)also, it can get crowded(very) the later it gets in the day. WARNING! Valet parking is expensive! For young children they can watch the dancing fountain and little girls can enjoy the American Girl Store. There's also a shop that sells old fashion toys and a fun can day store( there's a Sprinkles shop also). Sorry the review is so sporadic 😁. Summer is a lovey time to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnawhi
50,Great pedestrian shopping area,"This is a lovely place to wander, shop or go to the cinema. Situated right next to the farmers market, it has the usual large stores like Abercrombie & forever 21 & small stalls.

Parking is expensive but plentiful in their well organized multi level building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheepsLB
50,Nice place to visit,We found this one of the nicer stops as we toured around the Hop On Hop Off Bus. We were surprised. A nice variety of shops. A novel tram to ride down the main street. A beautiful lake/fountain with beautiful goldfish. Our kids loved it here. Some good shops like Forever 21 & American Girl. A nice atmosphere & right next to the wonderful Farmers Markets. We thought this was a gem in the middle of crazy LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzaT
10,"Way, way too crowded","This is just another mall. Don't waste your time. Same stores found at any other. LA has so much more to offer. If you do need to get some shopping done, this place is way too crowded to be an option. Literally tour bus loads of people are being brought here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607timz
50,Great Mall,We visited The Grove in December. It is a beautiful outdoor mall and was decorated beautifully for Christmas. My husband and i are from Sydney and it is exactly what we imagined as US mall to be like. There is not a huge amount of shopping to do there but we had fun strolling around. They had carollers singing in the streets and just had a great vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashwoo88
30,Not much selection..,"If you're looking for a day out clothes shipping and coming home with many different purchases from many different shops then the grove is not for you, there's a total of five major outlets, three of which cater for men, there are other outlets for men but they are highly priced and anyone traveling money smart wouldn't waste their time. I'd suggest going to a shipping mall like the one in Calver city, you'll get twenty times more if a shipping experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CameronTravels

We had lunch there too which was a real treat and good value.The Grove is adjacent to The Farmer's Market which is a great experience too.All in all if you like shopping you will love The Grove.

50,Most amazing shopping experience,"We in Houston are spoiled by the great shopping selection, but I am afraid not by service. What a surprise it was to visit the Grove: service exceeded all expectations. Nordi sales assistants were super helpful; can we bring them back home to Houston to train the local workforce? They were super in helping select sizes and cuts and topped off the experience with letting us know that valet parking was free with any purchase over $250. Vow!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UberWorldly
50,Super Fun and Amazing Grove,"What is the best about this place was the outdoor Farmer's Market place to eat. Must be at least 40+ vendors of every ethnic food you could imagine. This includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. Outdoor music evenings, movies, etc. A real treat and great to have developers create people places not just a shopping haven! Parking is around the back...and some vendors will validate tickets for you...just ask.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sesshi101

50,"Shopping, Strolling and Eating….great place to go","the grove LA is a top of the line place to go in Los Angeles, everything is done to perfection there. Its an outdoor shopping village with just the right stores and restaurants. The Barnes and Noble bookstore is one of the best in town and a great place to spend hours perusing all the wonderful books while having a nice cup of coffee at the indoor coffee shop. The Grove has a great Nordstrom store which has recently been remodeled and a wonderful shopping experience. The best part of the grove la is being outside, there is a big lawn where they often have concerts and events and a person can do some excellent people watching just relaxing outdoors. The fountain is a big attraction in the middle of the grove with dancing waters, never a dull moment.Another nice thing at the grove is the parking which is a giant structure and even though it is always busy you can always find a spot…they have a beautiful bathroom and family bathroom in the parking structure with the feel of a fancy hotel. No trick has been missed at the grove and there are plenty of food choices and desserts. This is a great place for tourists and locals. I give it a 5 star rating",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susannaa2000
40,Great place to visit,It's recommended to visit the Grove center. It's open space mall with walking around for most of stores. It is limited shops but nice place to visit. The Farmers Very close to visit also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALBADEEN
50,It's Like Disney Does Outdoor Mall,There's something about the vibe in this place that's great. Anytime I've gone it was buzzing - so much so that it's become a bit of a ritual. Leave enough time to have a good wander around and hit one of the swanky 'eateries'.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaveyF
40,Pet friendly outdoor mall,"AChain stores in a super cute outdoor setting. The Grove and farmers market are adjacent to one another, so a great people watching spot. Must love dogs! Every single store we went into had people with their little dogs in tow, some in strollers and lots of high end bling :) Luckily I love dogs, so no big deal for me, but if you're someone who is not so dog friendly, this may not be the shopping spot for you. Also had a cute fountain and outdoor music venue. One visit is enough, unless given another reason, such as a concert or book signing. Otherwise, pretty much same stores as any other mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlinr
50,Definitely worth a walk,It's nice little island of pedestrian friendly shopping. It's nice place to grab lunch and watch LA walk by,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coolverine
30,It's a MALL,"An outdoor Mall. With a food court. Big whoop. The trolley was back n forth entertainment suited for the under 10 crowd while the rest of us elbowed our way into stores. Unless you have unlimited time in LA and have exhausted every other form of recreation, or are a mall incensed teenager, pass this by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pairandaspare
40,Relaxed and quaint shopping area,"We stopped here because the Hop-on-hop-off bus stopped at the Farmer's Market next to it. So the Grove was more of a surprise. But a lovely one, feels more like walking through a small town. No cars allowed, many shops and smaller stands on the streets. Lovely to walk around to look or to do some shopping",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nesser68
30,Over-rated and Over-priced,"I live in LA and finally visited the Grove with an out-of-town friend. It was extremely crowded, like NY during rush hour. We had to park on the roof which turned out to be the highlight of our adventure. The view of LA from the roof of the garage is breathtaking, which is why I gave the Grove 3 points.The actual shopping center is overcrowded and nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NanceeLeeAllen
40,A nice place to hang out,"The Grove is a nice mall with different kinds of shops (there is a Taschen Bookstore, a Nike store, an Abercrombie & Fitch, a cinema, a lot of restaurants). The best thing is that it's next to the original Farmer's Market where you can enjoy great food after a long day of shopping.Parking is pretty expensive (around 25$ for 4 hours).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatildeSansH
40,Cool Tram,"Cool place to chill out, has all popular brand stores and a really nice Cinema.It's right next to the Farmer's Market which has many nice places to eat.I also really liked the old Tram that passed through here.If you are only in L.A. for a short time i wouldn't worry to much about visiting here but if you have the time its worth a look",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoddersGlobetrotter
50,Great Shopping venue,"Spent about 5 hours here and it felt easy to do. A great range of shops and restaurants ad the concierge service was excellent, set up like a hotel when you arrive in the car park!

Great outdoor shopping area with lots of different types of stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovesTheSunshine137
50,Not enough time,"After visiting the farmers market for lunch, we had a little time to walk around. It was much like the Americana at Brand, with the lovely lake and fountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baileys456
50,Amazing place!,"A must go! The first day I arrived in LA we went to the grove, Nicole Richie was interviewing for her new show and interviewed me! You never know who you will see!

40,Great local place to hang out & see a different side to LA,I visited the grove with some friends and lunched at Planet Dailies/Mixology. Great spot for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Great clothes shopping and farmers markets. A nice little discovery in the heart of LA that is nicer than some of the over crowded touristy spots. Worth a visit for lunch or drink and check out the shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJS9
40,Fun.,"This shopping pedestrian mall adjacent to the Farmer's Market is gorgeous! Clean and pretty. All your standard chain stores are here, but we did not even shop. We just enjoyed walking around. There is also a cute little tram that goes from one end to the other, and costs nothing. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaraFromToronto
40,Oasis in LA,"The Grove is a cool place to head to escape the hustle and bustle of LA and Hollywood, and still get some good shopping done. The design and flow of the area is excellent, with a little pond and park in the centre with complimentary picnic blankets to relax on. All the big name stores are there, so there's something for everyone.If you're traveling there as a tourist and not by private vehicle, there are complimentary taxi phones available from the Farmers Market part of The Grove. Trying to hail one won't get you far and it's between the tourist parts. Certainly worth a visit, and apparently it's where the celebs of Hollywood venture to when they go shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372willl
30,Pleasant chill,Spent and hour or two walking around enjoying the shops. Parking free for less than two hours in lot. A good addition activity if ur in the nieghborhood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elchay
50,Must go when in LA!,"If you are visiting the Los Angeles area you have to check out The Grove! A very upscale shopping, dining and entertainment experience. The center courtyard has a nice lawn area and water fountain. A good place to sit and relax after shopping. There is also a double decker trolley that will take you down to the Farmers Market. The Farmers Market is full of small speciality shops and eateries. Food from many different cultures. There was band playing when we were there and they had the crowd engaged with them. It was very crowded!! You might think about going during the week if you have small kids and strollers. Fee for parking unless you qualify for validation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chelibug
50,One of the best shopping experiences ever.,We wanted to get a new MacBook so we decided to go to The Grove as we always wanted to go there and the Apple Store seemed to be in a good location.A great shopping venue. The Apple Store was buzzing and managed to get my MacBook with the memory upgrade we wanted in a fair time considering how busy it was.The Cheesecake Factory was great for a mid morning snack. I had no idea that the Farmers Market was here which was a pleasant surprise and had lunch there from the BBQ pit.We felt very safe there and was a very welcoming place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyR723
50,"Green lawn, movies, food, and all that jazz","The Grove is a must if you visit Los Angeles. Mom can do some shopping while the kids play in the lawn, then get together for a movie. The Barnes & Nobles here sometimes features book signing, so check out the schedule. Our girls get to see Lea Michelle while they're here. Get parking validation from stores (2hrs) or movie (4hrs) or free when you spend $250. Across the street is the farmer's Market with all kinds of food. It's a great place even just for people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GU96910
40,"Fun spot to shop, dine and stroll","Perfect size. Not too huge but a nice variety too. We strolled, dined then caught a movie all in one spot! Great for a easy going day. Parking also very easy and free with a shopping talley of $250 or more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJAJKJ

20,Overrated,"There are many other places that you can go shopping, where there's less congestion and parking isn't an issue. The stores here aren't even that great.Definitely like the farmer's market more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunaidi
30,Depends what you are looking for,"My family and I went to The Grove for a second time. A previous trip was in 2010.So you can say that the first time ""thrill"" was lessened.The ambience is nice. Always a chance to see a celeb.Kylie and Kendall Jenner were going to be at the Barnes and Noble , to promote their book.This time we were looking to eat some food , from the market stalls.My daughter had fish, my wife and I Chinese.It was average tasting and overpriced. We also had to get an ATM , pay the star 3 dollar fee, because most of the stalls only take cash.Being the frugal traveler, my word, my wife calls me cheap, I went across 3rd St, adjacent to The Grove complex, where they have a large strip mall, with a cheaper fast food , Marshall and Ross stores. I bought bargained Disney and World Cup 2014 for presents there.In other words, if you think that eating at the market is going to be cheaper, it is not. You can pay almost the same at The Cheesecake Factory with AC and waiters, paying with credit or debit cards., without having to have minimum $15 in cash to pay for a meal and drink only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5481QPadamb
40,A day in the grove,"Had agreat time with hubby and daughter jordon. Saw Ashley Olsen discreetly...great dress! Some nice shopping, wonderful sunny day. Cheap parking , lotsa eating at the market!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonniep775
40,It's a great environment if you love chain stores,"If you love chain and department stores then you will love the Grove. It's really easy to get around and the atmosphere is delightful. If you are looking for something a little more unique then this is not the place for you. There is however a Johnny Was shop (which is why we actually went to the Grove) and there is also a cinema, some of the cafe's are also fabulous. We enjoyed our afternoon at the Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princessPaddington
40,Goes with Hilton checkers review,Got to see Snooki and Mario lopez. While watching extra one day I was able to find myself and pause it and take picture of tv with phone :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christina0522
20,Unless you're a tourist who wants to see Mario Lopez..why bother?,"I don't like the Grove. Some people LOVE the grove. Bleech. From the Main Street USA Disney trolley to the fountain to the completely fake architecture, I find it repelling. The movie theaters are over crowded (go to Arclight instead). None of the stores are so unique that I have to go there. It is crowded and full of bad energy. Now...a short stroll from the artificial to reality is the only reason to go there. The Farmer's Market at 3rd and Fairfax is as real as the Grove is fake. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarriorla
50,Great place to shop,"Open air, and shops on all sides. Great atmosphere with fountains and clean surroundings.Parking is validated if you shop for a total of more than 250 dollars (all shops)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimr937
40,Blast!,This place was a lot of fun! The outdoor mall had lots of stores to visit. The movie theater is conveniently placed. The Farmers Market was so amazing. I loved the variety in food. There were a lot of people though. Be prepared to walk a lot. We spent most of the day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laura_altamirano86

40,Shoppers' Paradise,"I walked over to The Grove/Farmer's Market with my cousin who lives nearby. This shopping area is a magnet for all of Los Angeles and contains every type of store one can imagine. Upscale, midscale, tourist, you name it. We wandered the large common area at the center with its fountain and just marveled at the size of it all. My cuz is a city planner and pointed out the large parking structure at the rear of the place and noted that everyone drives there as they do all over LA. I preferred the old style and folksiness of the adjoining Farmers' Market a reminder of the 20's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertocollins
30,This has lost it's sparkle,On previous visits to the Grove I have enthused about the place...however on this occasion in spite of fantastic weather I was disappointed with the overall experience. I don't quite know why but the coffee and ice cream booths on the Green looked somewhat tired and although the recent closure of the Ramsay restaurant is no real loss (see a previous review) a new restaurant is desperately needed in that location. I must say that the Farmer's Market area also looked tired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidHBlair
50,So cool,My sister and I walked around the grove for hours. We both felt very safe and seen lots of venues and did lots of shopping. We went back a second time just to have a bite to eat and wander around. The variety of shopping was great and lots of places to relax on the patio and have a great meal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandalarson

50,Get Away from the hussle and bussel of Hollywood,"The Grove is a wonderful open air shopping complex. It's quiet, clean, modern with a twist. A cable car offers lifts and a fun thing for the kids. There is designer shops and everydayshops a well not so expensive . bridges and ponds with water falls gives this place a wonderful ambiance. Attached to the Grove is the Farmers Market with loads of terrific stalls and eateries all at market prices. Its easy to get to by bus and there is always cabs. We felt very relaxed and spent quiet a few hours cruising around. A wonderful place to be to get away from the glitz and busyness of Hollywood without the Rodao Drive price tag.Very enjoyable would definately go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/361julied
50,Beautiful small shopping mall in downtown LA,"If you want to do some shopping while in Los Angeles this small mall is a must visit! The grounds are beautiful, there is a fountain with dancing water and a very scenic bridge, small grassed area with places to eat and drink from Jamba Juice to The Cheesecake Factory. There is not a huge choice of shops but that is not the point of The Grove. It is a great place to people watch, everyone looks or acts famous but all types of people mingle here so no one should feel out of place.There is a very nice Farmers Market right next door which looks like it hasn't changed since the '50's, and deliberately so! Definitely also worth a visit.There is a large multi storey car park attached to the Mall so there are plenty of parking spaces. A great place to visit, to see and be seen at while visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sge31
50,Truly different!,"A modern interpretation of a city square, or piazza,with all the modern sensibilities. Great shopping, dining, movies and people watching venue.Cool fountains, a neat trolley and wonderful shops. A must see when in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305wendyd
50,Brilliant!,"Absolutely loved The Grove! I went in the early evening for a bit of shopping, then to The Cheesecake Factory (which I highly recommend!!)Nice choice of clothing, sweets and accessory shops. Lovely atmosphere and fountain show.It was nice to slip through one of the allyways to the streets behind the Grove where you can find the market stalls with food etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622anitah

40,Nice place to hang out,"If your looking for a place to hangout or dine then the grove would be perfect ! It's atmosphere is quite amazing, very LA ish and fun ! However, I didn't find the grove to be the ultimate shopping destination as it lacks variety and it has a limited amount of shops compared to other shopping attractions in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariama974
50,Beautiful shopping area,"Well maintained, diverse shopping area. Large parking (a bit expensive), nice restaurants and a lot of nice stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chavje
20,Over rated. It's just a shopping centre,"My son and I visited The Grove a few days ago whilst spending time in LA. I read all the reviews and thought it must be something special. I was disappointed. It's very twee-reminds me of Disney Main Street and it has a cute cable car. But the cable car just goes round and round a very small space. The Farmer's Market did not appeal. It was crowded, dark and smelt less than pleasant. I wouldn't want to eat there. The shops at the other end are nice but there is not a great selection. Frankly just a shopping centre and not a tourist attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34Linda34
50,Beautiful space to shop..,"This truly is a beautiful space to shop.. Lots of great stores and cafés, restaurants.. Be sure to check it out when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finecigarsandcoins
30,OK for an afternoon,"This is a nicely presented mall, its clean and benefits from being open air, however dont expect bargain prices, this is mainly shopping for the higher end pocket.There are good food options, but either book or be very flexibleOverall, this is a good place, but there are far better options",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigMuss
30,Basically a pretty outdoor mall,The atmosphere at The Grove is cool. It's definitely nice to take a stroll and look at all the storefronts & people watch but that was about it. There's a nice fountain and a cable car that runs through it as well as a movie theatre. My experience was ok. It was my first time and I'm glad I had a chance to see it. Probably won't be going back unless I win the lotto. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310dini

50,Neat Place -Lifestyles of the Rich,We recently went to the Grove in Los Angeles. after seeing it mentioned sooooo many times on TMZ we decided to go check it out. We had lunch and some drinks. My wife was treated to a Michael Koors purse and needless to say she was thrilled. Great to people watch and relax. Just remember to bring your credit card. It's expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingjohn1230
40,Great Place - (the market in the back is excellent),"All in all - a great place to connect with friends, grab a bit and catch up with the chit chat and going's on of life. We love the chillax vibe of the market area in the back (more than the actual consumerism Grove Aspect). The market area has excellent filtered coffee place, array of local eats, and locals and tourists looking for great food at a great price.Wonderful place to come in Christmas/Holiday Season in LA...as they decorate it up to the hilt with all the spectacular glory only the Christmas Season has to offer in the warm climate in LA. The next best thing to a Snowman and Frostbite you will get during the Xmas season in La La Land.The Grove's next best point is - The Farmers market in the back is one of my favorite places to go to in LA. Reminds me of perhaps St. Lawrence Market and a bit of Kensington market in Toronto.Everytime I go to LA I have to go to The Grove Farmers Market and meet up with my friends there (its just something that makes my trips to LA enjoyable and fun).The rest of the mall is fun to walk around - lot's of tourists and locals (but with all the usual Generic stores).The cinema is wonderful - so good place to meet friends, catch a movie and a bite.Lot's of people watching to be done here too.However the best part is the Farmers Market in the back area ......that is what makes The Grove well....The Grove to me.Parking is interesting - once I went there and seen two people fight over a spot :-).....kind of fun for a passive Canadian to watch...yet shocking. Note: Parking can be a bit of an adventure, however it is not impossible to achieve, just drive to the inside parking lot and it has several levels to it - and each level is automated letting you know how many parking spots are available on each level (making it relatively easy to determine if you will go to P1 drive up to P2 or keep going to P3 Level).However, besides this - great food in the Farmers Market portion of The Grove and excellent coffee to be had there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divinelyguided

30,If You Like to Shop,"We ended up at The Grove after having breakfast at the Original Farmers Market, a couple blocks away. The Grove is about one block of upscale shopping venues (several stories high), with a couple of tiny side streets branching off to more shopping. Anchor stores include Barnes and Noble, The Cheesecake Factory ...There's a lovely fountain at one end, with water jets creating entertainment as they take turns spouting spray into the air, and a bridge crossing the pond. You can choose from several restaurants, and there's also a movie theater. The Chinese dragon at the entrance makes a nice backdrop for photo-ops.If you're not in a shopping mood, the ambiance and activity makes for a pleasant, interesting walk and favorable people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FancyFree55
40,The Grove Best Outdoor Mall in Los Angeles,"The Grove is by far the best outdoor mall in Los Angeles. Not only does it have a ""Hollywood"" feel but it also has ""Disney"" feel, especially at night. Now that's a combination. You've got to experience it at night, when it comes alive with lights and music. All the latests retail shops are here and there are lots of restaurants, with the Farmer's Market within walking distance. Plan on visiting for 4-6 hours minimum. Lunch and and Dinner times are the worst with so many people and waiting for a table can be up to one hour. Eat when everyone else is shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawaiian555

30,Not sure what all the hype is about,"The Grove has a nice outdoor atmosphere, but it is almost always so packed. I try to avoid it on the weekends - it can take a long time to find parking and exit the mall, and if you're in a hurry, it can get frustrating trying to rush through the huge crowd of people at the mall. However, The Grove is really nice during the holidays, because it feels very festive and the decorations, with the outdoor atmosphere, makes it very enjoyable. Overall, it is way too busy and crowded for me and I don't see how it is much better than other malls I have visited. I only come here if I absolutely need to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linnea182
50,Love love love it!,"Clean, safe, all the right shops and a Cheesecake Factory to boot! Even in winter it's great but especially in summer when the water fountain has live entertainment.

We enjoyed another great day here and would recommend it to anyone as an excellent place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOBright
50,A Must Visit!!,This isn't just a shopping experience. The original farmers market is accessible by walking here. So many things to see and places to eat. We saw Smokey Robinson here with his wife which was an additional treat. We had come here the year before as well when Extra still filmed here and saw Mario Lopez with Stevie Wonder as a guest performer. This was all at no cost. Great shops and decorations around Christmas - they really go all out. They set up an entie Santa workshop building for the children to talk to Santa. Mixology is also located at The Grove and is a favorite hangout for the Dancing with the Stars participants sometimes. Keep your eyes open and i'm sure you will see some celeb!! Have fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bankerchic77
50,Shopping somewhere a bit different,"The Grove is not a huge area, but sports most of the more popular stores. there is an amazing Barnes and Noble book store which was a real plus as book shops are getting scarce nowdays. The centre is lovely - we went there just a few days after Christmas and all the lights were still up. Its more of a boutique shopping experience - nothing like shopping at one of the vast malls that abound!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pennypickle
50,Loved our day there!,This was one of the highlights for our Californian trip (we are from Australia). My daughter (12 at the time) and I caught a cab there from Hollywood (husband and son went to Legoland) and started our day with breakfast at the Farmer's Markets and strolled through the markets for a while then moved on to The Grove shopping area - daughter's highlight being the American Girl Store and the cable car. We had a fabulous Italian lunch overlooking the fountain and enjoyed people watching. A fabulous girly day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoBro4
50,Festive for the Holidays,"We have been here a few times when in LA and it has always been nice. Great restaurants - but be prepared to usually wait. Love the Farmer's Market area.

40,Loved it! Fun stop and loved the farmers market!,"The food was amazing if you like farmers markets and local food. Great outdoor atmosphere, reminded me of some of the markets in Europe. Grab some food and sit down for a nosh. Very casual, fun to walk around, perfect for all ages... there is something for everyone! Great coffee at ""Bob's"" and middle eastern food nearby. Next door is a modern mall with Topshop and Nordy's but we found the market to be our favorite part!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiwistudios
40,Holiday decorations LA style,"The shopping here is not different than other malls in the area but the experience is unique. Holiday decorations are over the top. Great place to people watch. The place is packed with people, dogs, strollers and so many things. The fountains are so Hollywood. Definitely a great place to bring out of town guests. The trolley can be a bother because there are so many people, it's difficult to just walk without bumping into other people. I don't know how they can operate the trolley safely. Cute idea tho. Parking is validated for 2 hours if you purchase something at the mall. However, it takes you about 20 minutes to find a parking spot. And getting around the mall takes extra time due to the congestion and then if you parking more than 2 hours, the validation is worthless because they charge you for the whole time you, not just anything over 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadomom2
40,Beautiful centre,A really nice place to spend an afternoon. There are lots of variety of shops from department stores to speciality stores to sports retail. A few great food options too. The Christmas decorations were lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Batmane
50,The Grove in LA,Parking can be a problem or at least around Christmas and there is a charge to park per hour. The Grove was very pretty for Christmas with the Christmas lights up and the Ginger bread Christmas house. Lots of stores to go in. There is a See's candy store there also. Pretty to go see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardentogarden

40,Nice place to spend time with family and friends,"We visited it a week before thanksgiving, the last morning before our trip back home; the place wasn't crowded but we had a hard time finding a parking space. We had brunch at the Cheesecake Factory and did some shopping in the kiosk center court. It was nice and relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChantoNat

Check out the cool candystore close to the entrance near farmers market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TineM226

40,In The Groove at the Grove,"Tired of complaining teenage children? Fed up with a dispirited spouse? Hungry for something besides a foot long sandwich? Take your stressed and sensitive clan to the Grove and Farmers Market and witness the miracle of satisfaction, for even your most Grinchly family members. Need a bottle of butt scorching hot sauce for your loud mouthed uncle? There's a store here for that. Need a break from reality that only a good movie can provide? Got a theater there too. Hungry for incredible pizza, deli, asian food or warm doughnuts? Check, check, and check. And if your teen can't find the right clothes, the right electronic devise or the right book on tattoo, then bring them to the Grove, turn 'em loose, and meet back in a couple of hours near the giant Christmas tree to share new found treasures and enjoy a cup of warm cocoa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaelicgregory

40,Have to take a look,Our friends took us here when we were visiting Beverly Hills. This place was really great. It is all decorated up for Christmas. My favorite part was the water fountain show. We ate at some Cajun place and had the gumbo. The best part was that it was happy hour and we got our beers at a great price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sigs99
50,One of our favorites,"The Grove is such a great place, one of our favorites in LA. Great shopping, lots of parking space and great restaurants. The Farmers Market is always fun aswell.

10,Very poor event management,"There were posters all over town advertising the tree lighting event on Sunday 11/18 at the Grove. Decided to go with the family thinking we'll see the lights and have a bite to eat.Arriving there well in advance of the event we found that everything in the Grove was shut down, no restaurants or shops open. Worst of all there was no way to get in to the Grove. All entrances were blocked off. Hundreds or perhaps thousands of people were visibly frustrated at not being able to get in. Security people were unsure on the message. They kept directing people to go to the next entrance but they were also closed.People go to the Grove to spend money and we were all treated like we were really bothering the staff and security people. ""You're not allowed in"", ""Go to the next entrance"", ""We are closed, please move along"".Disastrous management.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dermotc792
50,Very nice mall and great farmers market,The mall is very nice and you could possibly find a famous personality there. But to me the gem of this area is the farmers market and all the eating places. Need to search for it. Enjoy!!! you will find something for everybody.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marioo552
50,Good choice of shops,The grove has a good selection of shops and is hand for the farmers market for cheap food and drinks. The Abercrombie & finch store had some great bargains.

40,Very nice outdoor mall,"The Grove has a good number of shops (not too many for a husband, just enough for a wife) and a good variety. Also is right next to the farmers market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speake53
30,Shopping at the Grove,"The Grove is an outdoor mall with many upscale shops and restaurants just behind the Farmer's Market in LA. This is also where they film ""Extra"" so you can often stop and watch Mario Lopez do his thing. There are dancing fountains towards the back which provide a nice respite from the shopping. Not too big and easy to navigate, the Grove is a nice place to visit for quick shopping, eating, or a coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tolives

Lots of bigger restaurants to choose from also.I would recommend checking out the Groove to anyone who visits LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EXgeMMy
50,Wow!,My only excitement at first was to get to visit the historic farmers market which is a neighboring site. What another mall? Even outdoor malls...I had seen them in Florida years ago. Yawn. But oh my....this is not your ordinary mall. Well yes the same stores that you have in every upscale mall....but the concept of this mall....the beauty of the buildings and how they are all put together and laid out is very very impressive. Our son whom we were visiting explained the number of years and the amount of perseverance it tooK the guy who conceived this to bring it to a reality and you have to have instant respect. Even if you are not in the mood to shop...go to look at this place. It is a marvel. And the farmers market is nice too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaitaliaupstateNY
50,Retail Therapy,The Grove is a great place to spend a few hours. It is located in the Beverly Hills district and features a number of high-end stores and restaurants. It includes the famous Farmers Market which originally opened in 1934. The market area is ideal to explore and try some of the many foods on offer from the stalls & upmarket deli's. We also had a meal at Morels French bistro while we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewVale67
40,Nice Atmosphere,"We visited The Grove after staying in The Grove parking garage when attending a taping of the Craig Ferguson show. We didn't know anything about The Grove prior to this, but we decided to explore it further and to grab a bite to eat there after the show. The Grove is a cute outdoor shopping mall with nice restaurants and shopping opportunities. It also has a free trolley system that transports you through the mall. Be sure to check out the fountain, which is lit up at night and ""dances"" along with music. While at The Grove, we ate at Fat Cow (excellent burger) and watched a movie at the theater (very nice theater). It is worth noting that the views from the parking garage are quite nice. From where we were at, we could view the mountains and the ""Hollywood"" sign.While The Grove is not something that you should go out of your way to visit, it is worth a stop if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91shannonk
40,Cute outdoor mall,"I went to The Grove because people told me I had to while in LA for the day. My initial impression was great. I liked the different atmosphere compared to other shopping areas - there's a trolley track, there are fountains, and music playing outside. The landscape is really cute.There's also a great farmers market with tons of food options with a bit of everything - american, asian, seafood, coffee, candy/desserts, etc. I walked through and the food was on the pricier side but I guess you're paying for the atmosphere too.The stores themselves are ok. The reason why this place gets 4 and not 5 stars is because it's smaller than I thought it would be. It looks so big and grand at first, but it ended up being pretty small which was disappointing (and I don't walk that fast).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizC709
30,"It's a shopping mall, nothing more nothing less","Granted this place is kept spotless and is a nice place to be but it's just shops in an outdoor complex, if you like shopping go, if you don't don't!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leet_12
40,Nice Mall,Really nice Mall. Tram and fountain are stand-out. Good cinema too. Greek restaurant our favourite place to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bufty100
50,Good place for star watching and for great shopping in a ritzy environment!,One of the most beautiful malls I have ever been to. Love the design and restaurants within although I did not eat there. Makes you think of places in Europe. The Extra TV show is filmed there as well. Parking is not free only drawback.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canadiatravelgoddess
40,Great place to spend a few hours,"We visited the Grove for some shopping while on honeymoon. We were mainly looking for a jewellers with the intention of purchasing a new watch like Tag Heuer but were surprised to find that there were no jewellery stores in the shopping centre.However the rest of the place is a lovely experience. There is a nice atmosphere and we loved the fact that the whole place is outdoors, beautifully landscaped and pleasing on the eye. While we didn't find what we were looking for we did end up buying some clothes and other items as there are some great high end boutiques on site. The staff were very friendly in every store that we visited. The grove is a nice place to spend a couple of hours and while there isn't a huge range of stores present, the selection of boutiques there are lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PEJACorkcity
50,"""A Walk Down Glitzy Main Street","I love this place. Open, lots of stores, lots of different people, really good restaurants to choose from, lots of film choices, AND a trolley!! Oh, not to leave out fabulous water fountains with music throughout the Grove (not the annoying kind)! A lot to see and enjoy. Put on your walking shoes!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIndaFeinstein
30,High end shopping,"This is a high end shopping area with restaurants. There is a free trolley that will take you to the Farmers Market, which would have been better to than trying to find parking at the Farmers Market. If you buy something at The Grove, have the merchant validate your parking ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationlady1
50,Pleasant place to spend an evening,"Vibrant area with really good atmosphere. Shops & restaurants, family friendly, you can just stroll around & sit by the fountains which 'dance' to music or eat at one of the many restaurants which meet most peoples tastes & budgets. The Grove has events from time to time and whilst we were there the band The Backstreet Boys were appearing. We stayed nearby and visited The Grove many evenings. The Wholefood supermarket nearby is also worth a visit. Here you can purchase good quality cheap 'fast' food which you can eat on site inside or outside at the tables provided. Farmers Market across the road is also worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillyKent
50,Lovely atmosphere,"This is my favorite mall ever. The area is so nice, clean, nicely decorated, it gives you the feeling of being in a little village. The shops are nice and staff is very friendly. I'm not particularly happy about the guys who try to sell their products in the stand along the street. They are very pushy and a bit annoying. But the rest is very enjoyable. Restaurants are nice, but very expensive.The cinema is very beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioNer944
50,So cool!,"I just loved the Grove. Such a fantastic part to shop, grab some food and people watch. There was always something going on down there, and I really loved the vibe of the place. A great range of shops and a wide range of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiaOraKiwi
40,Nice atmosphere..,"We stopped by this open air mall on our way to Griffith. Very nicely organized and decorated mall. There is a parking fee. There is a farmers market where there are many good deli,cafes and restaurants. Seemed like good food at reasonable prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzgurRosti
40,Awesome place to walk around,"I thought The Grove was an awesome place to walk around. I couldn't believe all the different vendors! It had a state fair vibe to it, especially when it came to the food vendors. I liked how they had tables set up sporadically throughout as well as a central ""food court"" area. I came with kids, and they really liked looking at the meat and all the huge vegetables. Some of the ""aisles"" are tight, and so while most of it is stroller friendly, there might be some tight squeezes or tight turns in a couple places.If I lived in the LA area, I would definitely be making frequent trips to The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kb9906
40,Celebrities!,"The grove has the top notch stores such as the 3 story Abercrombie and fitch building, Michael lots, Louis Vuitton, and much more. And the chances of meeting someone famous is high. I met Mario Lopez and it was unbelievable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheerboy101
40,Great place to shop and grab some food.,"This is a cute outdoor shopping experience with many stores to choose from. I can't say you'll find any great deals here but there a great atmosphere and uniqueness to this area.Of course you have to stop by the big candy store, Dylan's. There are so many choices I'm sure you're able to find something there.There is a parking garage that says 2 hours free parking. But you have to download, or use a certain website to pay. You can't validate your ticket at a store. I never did get that website to work and ended up paying for parking at the garage. I'm not sure if there are other parking options around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3082RGtonim
40,Nice place to visit,"The Grove is connected to the Farmer's Market, a long-time L.A. attraction. The Grove is a pleasant outdoor mall, with shade trees and fountains. There's a large Barnes and Noble bookstore (now an endangered species in L.A.), furniture stores, upscale clothing stores, a movie theater and a number of restaurants. For well-to-do parents of little girls, there is the American Girl doll store. A trolley goes from one end to the other. It's always fun browsing in the Farmer's Market, with its many stalls selling everything from jewelry to hot dogs. Parking in a multi-story structure is free for two hours with a validation from one of the shops or restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaSandy
50,Great shopping with concierge service,"Terrific movie theaters, good restaurants, an outstanding J. Crew, one of the best Barnes & Noble in the country, a Barneys New York (why is there no apostrophe?), a trolley, and it's next door to one of L.A.'s best attractions, the Farmer's Market. Most of the restaurants validate parking.At first, it appears to be just another open-air mall. It's much more. And they have a unique feature: concierge service.For visitors (a nicer word than tourist) this free service is a real plus. They can help with shopping, restaurant reservations, checking packages, baby strollers, and much more.The Grove won't be on any list of attractions when visiting Los Angeles - but it should be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zadkine
40,Cool place to visit--along with the rest of LA!,We went to lunch at the Farmer's Market for lunch which was a fabulous people-watching experience. The Grove was a beautiful mall and not too big so easy to check out. As foreigners we were blown away by American Girl which is essentially a two-storey doll shop. The place was packed full of shoppers & girls taking their dolls to the hospital to get fixed. That was cute but the ultimate was the hair salon where you can pay for your doll to get a makeover. What the?!Great day/half day out in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanda6969
30,A little disappointed,"The Grove itself is a lovely little area, in the July sunshine it was a nice spot to walk around. However, all the shops are pretty basic. I was hoping for something a little special, maybe even some boutiques but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Parking is great and resturants will validate your parking for 2 hours and the cinema does it for longer. We went to the movies and the theatre is grand and the movie we saw was great. We ate at the Cheesecake factory and sat outisde which was a nice spot to people watch the grove shoppers below. Dylan's candy store was fun and we did pick up a Michael Kors purse so it wasn't all bad, i was just hoping for a little something extra.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarah_ldn1
40,Small shopping area,Fantastic! Everyone on my trip loved the grove! It is fairly small and not many shops but still a great atmosphere. Dylan's Candy Bar is a great place to visit and some very nice restaurants there as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294CourtneyB
40,Cute place to look around,"The Grove is a lovely place (in the sunshine) to look around with lots going on. We visited in May (I had been previously) and at the time they were filming Access Hollywood, Mario Lopez was there which created quite a crowd.The shops are lovely to look around and the farmers market is very cool. There are so many places to go and eat and there is a place inside the farmers market which sells different beers. Pinkberry frozen yog is also at the farmers market.Lovely fountain in the middle of the grove & very pretty surroundings. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneE550

50,Find the farmers market section,"At first glance I was a little disappointed to find a big outdoor shopping mall, (altho a stop in Dylan's Candy Bar made it sweeter,) but I knew about the farmers market so we muddled through the crowds to find cubby holes of unique shops, food and even a happening sports bar. It was crowded on a Saturday, but that adds to the people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CO127
40,Great shopping and restaurants,"The Grove is a must visit spot for us when we're in LA because of the American Girl Place (2 girls, hello!?) but we love the place because of all the shopping options - carts all the way up to department stores - and good restaurants.

40,Place to shop in LA,"To be honest I am not a big fan of shopping and only went to The Grove because my wife and daughter wanted to go.Yes in a sense this is just another mall but it is very well done. For a start it is open air, which is nice, and interestingly laid out (unlike normal malls). There are plenty of cafes and restaurants, together with street entertainment and a tram.All the stores you would want to find are located here.The farmer's market is also next door.My family loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgieA1
40,"First Time Visit to ""The Grove""","Visiting The Grove was on my to-do list on a recent trip to LA. It is well-landscaped, the buildings have great architecture, and there is a beautiful water fountain that glistens at night. It is also a pedestrian-friendly outdoor shopping mall. The stores are the same stores you would see in most large cities: Nordstrom is an anchor store, Forever 21, J Crew, Banana Republic, etc., and there isn't a large plethora of those. The Grove is great for people-watching, and this includes celebrities. The television show, ""Extra"" is taped there during the week, so you if you want to take in the scene of LA and get a glimpse of a celebrity or two, this is your place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Precious89
40,'The Grove Shopping Mall' and 'Farmers' Market' make for a fun day out in L.A!,"This review is for The Grove Shopping Mall in Los Angeles:I had been here a few times before, but on this trip to L.A., I wanted to take my husband, as well as the Farmers' Market next door.There are a limited amount of stores and a lot of them are really high-end (Read: Out of the average person's price range!) but it's a fun place to look around and window shop. It's very attractive with fountains and ponds and there is a general hustle bustle with a mix of tourists and locals. For us, the Farmers Market next door was probably more fun and eclectic, but it all made for a fun day out in LA.PROS:~Cheesecake factory -- great for lunch!~Large 3-story Barnes & Nobles book store.~Fascinating 'American Girl' store. Go in there even if you don't have kids just to be amazed!~Attractive layout with ponds and fountains, etc.~Next door to the Farmers' Market. (You don't need to move your car).CONS:~Paid parking in the adjacent multi story parking lot. (Although there is an hour or two free with validation when you buy something).~High-end stores -- makes for better window shopping than anything for us average folks.~A little touristy.If you found this review helpful, please click the green 'yes' button.

40,A fun visit,"This was a neat area with some great eateries (Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant, Fat Cow, is located here) and a fabulous cupcake place called Sprinkles (try the red velvet and you won't be disappointed!). There wasn't too much to do around here besides eat and browse some of the shops. The best part was that it's right beside the Farmer's Market, which was a blast! Lots of vendors, souveniers, and most importantly, food!Definitely take the time to check this place out. I'd probably allocate a couple of hours, which should give you enough time to take everything in and get ready for your next stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimitraT
10,It's just a mall people,"Crowded, dangerous pedestrian crosswalks. Automated self parking that rips you off. Stay closer to home if your not within 15 minutes of this place or shop online.

40,Good shopping sesh...,"Loved the farmers market as we came into The Grove, so much on offer food and goods wise. Had lots to chose from.. The shopping centre itself was very funky and filled with a wide range of decent shops other features include the tram passing through to the 'cute, as the missus put it' bridge and water features. This place has a lot to offer and definitely worth a visit on an afternoon. Although I would say one downside (and I don't know whether this is us or in general) but cabs and taxis are very difficult to get outside the complex, we had to walk a bit further down the road with all our bags which I guess is a slight inconvenience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanyterrett

Fun place to walk around and people watch, easy to get to, convenient parking (stores, restaurants validate). Extra tapes in the Grove center area between 11 and 2 - schedule of guest posted by fountain - and it is fun to watch and participate. Crew really nice to audience - provided sun screen and water on really hot morning. Good choice of restaurants - try the Fat Cow- and shopping. Saw paparazzi during evening visit - they were waiting for specific stars to arrive - also saw a few minor celebrities. Generally a fun place to go, easy to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayneM832

40,Crowded,"We drove there and finding a parking space was a bit hard, we went on a Saturday though, so I assume all the malls on a Saturday are the same. We parked on the 6th floor and payed 4 dollars per maybe an hour or a bit more. The place is great for shopping, but hard to walk with a pram and a toddler because as I said, it was very crowded. We were looking for a Victorias secet shop only to find out that has been closed down. Anyway, we enjoyed a nice lunch in the farmers market and it was good to see the fountain with all this huge fish., my three years old loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabhoff
40,Nice Outdoor Mall,"The Grove is an outdoor shopping area that is adjacent to The Farmers Market. We arrived around 9:30 am on a Saturday morning and parking in the designated lots for The Farmers Market and The Grove was not a problem.If you have a little girl who likes American Girl you HAVE to make The Grove a stop on your visit. The store is enormous with 3 stories and everything you can imagine for the little girl in your life. Even my 16 year old (who used to be a big AG fan) was mesmerized by the place.There was an outdoor entertainment area, a movie theater, a many shops in all price ranges. The Barnes and Noble store is also worth a mention as it is huge, also with 3 stories. Of course there were other higher end stores that we strolled by and window shopped.There were also signs advertising that they did taping there M-F of a show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoastalDreamer70
40,Good shopping; very crowded on a weekend!,"We headed to The Grove and Farmers Market and found the Grove to be a great place to walk around during summer. Lots of great stores and things to look at. The water fountain was very cool and it drew a crowd.Bit of a warning; it is very crowded with families on the weekend. There is an American Girl shop & you'll notice lots of little girls with dolls running around the mall. Lots of strollers too, so just keep an eye out for your kids if you take a family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caitlinb238
40,A good place to visit,"The Grove has a great range of shops and food venues, it was great just to stroll around and enjoy a late afternoon browse. The fountain was brilliant, we particularly enjoyed the hourly show with music and lights and we ate in the Italian restaurant right next to the fountain which had lovely food and a great view (although it was expensive). We preferred a stroll around here then heading over to the farmers market for food as it was great quality for a better price than the Grove. All in all I would say definitely worth a visit - in my opinion this is much nicer and more atmospheric than a normal shopping mall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyT948
40,Great food court,"We came to visit this area for my daughter to see Access Hollywood being filmed since it showed on the website the hours were 9-3pm M-F. No such luck. Not one camera or personality around. We saw the pretty fountain and shops, but nothing more than your average shopping center. The food court area is huge. If you can dream it they got it. Great prices too. Good place to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biltrim
50,Had a great day,Like : everything! Good selection of shops. Farmer's market is a great place to eat/shop. Greek restaurant Ulysses is very good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411MD
40,Fun Place,"Nice place to shop or people watch. This is where Mario Lopez films ""Extra"". Lots of restaurants and high end shops. Little kiosks in the middle of the grove that you can shop in also which is less expensive. Nice fountain in the middle. Seems crowded at all times. Has parking lot that you pay for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeLoveTraveling23
50,Liked this a lot!,"We were taken here on a tour and saw Mario Lopez as well as ""Extra"" filming. We did eat lunch and browse around. We came back the next day on our own and saw 2 stars from ""Arrested Development"" doing a picture/audigraph session. We could still get within 15 feet of them and take their picture etc. If you eat at The Cheesecake Factory they will fix your parking ticket so parking is free. There are lots of trendy stores etc and this is a great place for people watching. I would go back here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniem467
40,Nice for a day out,"A really cute place in LA, lots of shops around but definitely more high-end apart from a forever 21. We were a big group so ended up at the Cheesecake factory for lunch which isn't very exciting (good food though) but there looked like a few cute restaurants were around. Also if you go behind the grove, there's a Ross which is a great discount store. It's on the main road, if you have Dylan's candy bar in front of you take a left and you'll see it across the street.DEF try out the farmer's market, it wasn't too crowded when we went and there were some great little stalls..2 for 1 sangria really got me :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dp07100
50,Simply the Best,"We only went to The Grove because of The Extra tv show filming. We go to see The Real Housewives of OC, Mario and Maria. It was so much fun. We got 100,00 gift card for standing for over 2 hrs for the show. They provide you with plenty of water and it was fun to watch how the show is filmed. The Farmers market is so much fun. Lots of different food choices. A must visit if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716lynnb
50,Simply the best.,"I was hesitant going here, but it was probably one of the main highlights of my trip to LA. Loved the farmer's market/the Grove. Wish I could go back just to go there again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmishaA
50,What a nice outdoor mall,"For us east coasters, this was a nice treat! An outdoor mall with a farmer's market, plenty of food choices, nice shops. Not like a regular strip mall, very pretty! They even had live music!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deniseandfrancois
40,Nice shopping mall !,"Nice place to hang out, eat and shop. A little bit pricey your in LA. It's a good place to have dinner with family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renatol349
50,something for everyone!,"Oh boy, if you like shopping, eating, and few glasses of wine, you will be in the right place! Too many stores and restaurants to mention, all of them good, ambiance is wonderful, it also has a small farmers market not to be missed! We took a cab from the hotel, great idea if you are having lunch and wine, then sticking around for dinner and wine! We had so much fun there, we went back twice, and still kept seeing stores and restaurants we missed! Bring the family, bring a date, bring a friend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicajohns
40,Nice place to visit,"The place is nice to visit and shop. It has a nice fountain and landscaping. The place can be seen as a replica of the americana at brand but in smaller scale, however it is nice to spend few hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sis1111
40,Good shopping place,"LA is a shopping destiny, and The Grove is the shopping destiny in LA. Besides it has a very good vibe, not the typical giant shopping mall, it is more like streets full of stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarylinB
40,Extra! Extra!,We only went here because we wanted to see the taping of Extra. But Maria M. wasn't there the Monday we went. It was fun anyway. The stores are good. The Farmers Market was a great place to have lunch with every kind of ethnic food available. Yummy! There is also a trolley that runs the street. We enjoyed it. Parking is reasonably priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plastx2
50,Great Shopping Experience in LA,"We really enjoyed the shopping, cleanliness and eating options at the Grove. Safe, modern, places at all standards to eat and shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FIZZYS
40,Great Vibe,"We visited this place on Mothers Day and the vibe and atmosphere was amazing. There was a band in the street, beautiful weather and the smell of great food. Great shops, fabulous little farmers market but the only downfall is the neighbourhood isn't the greatest driving up. It's like all of a sudden you go from driving through a rough area to turning a corner into a beautiful as specifically for high end persons. Park in the The Grove Parking area, make a purchase at a store and have your parking validated so you'd end up with 2 hrs free instead of one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeekExplore
40,A enjoyable experience,Plenty of food choices but the area could be tidier the whole area as a holiday feel to it very busy agood selection of shops to suit all price ranges the tram running through the centre is a novelty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulineT780
50,Shopping and entertainment,"Packed with tourists and locals, this is a clean and inviting place to do some shopping. And being next to CBS, maybe even see an actor or two. Extra is filmed here if you are a fan of the show. Be sure to visit the farmers market next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doug2244
30,Nice for a mall,"We chose to go to The Grove based on the comments and family's recommendations. I was disappointed because it was nothing more than an outdoor mall. While it was nice to have the ""mall area"" surrounded by the stores (to give an enclosed feel), the stores were not unique but national chains. In a lot of ways it reminded me of the outlet malls I'm used to in the Northeast. Thankfully it was in the 70's but I would hate to be outside shopping in the 90-100's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darxhow
20,Just another big open air mall with the same stores. How disappointing.,"Nice enough stores and restaurants but no different than Atlanta. Tampa, Long Island, etc. if this is LAs best, I could have stayed home. Where's the unique vibe or new fashion ideas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler5
50,A Must !!,"Great area for people watching, shopping and grabbing a bite to eat. Very clean and open. The tram is a bit of a waste but adds ambiance to the area. Go in the evenings when everything is lit up and the crowds are bigger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpattison
50,Shopping and entertainment street,"Action packed with tourists and locals, went on a public holiday- things were a bit quiet, came back later when everything was open and it was way more awesome, must go to the farmers market across the road for lunch. Very clean and attractive district, must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortezaliscous
50,Great Shopping and Star Watching,Loved this area. Was part of the Extra audience. Got to see Len Goodmen. He was very nice and handsome. We walked around did some shopping and grabbed a pizza at the Farmers Market. Go early to ensure a spot in the extra audience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyaway0921
50,Great day at the Grove,A wonderful shopping centre and a great way to soak up the LA atmosphere. The Farmers Market at the end of the Grove is a foodies haven and I only wish I could return every weekend! Make sure you visit World Marketplace for cool homewares and bits and pieces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABC123709
40,The farmers market a must visit place,"At the end of the grove if the farmers market which is fantastic for eating. There is a multitude of different cuisines, all at really competitive prices. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robwelf0
50,Lovely shopping centre,The layout of this shopping centre is great with it all being outside. We there on a Sunday afternoon and there was a great band playing too... Nice way soak in some LA atmosphere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordiness
40,Lots of shops,An outside mall like area with lots of fun shops. Some shows actually film there during the day time. A great place to window shop and lots of places to eat as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjgardeski
40,Happening Place,"It is an outdoor mall. Movie theaters, restaurants, shopping, and a Farmers Market. The Farmers Market portion is the original one in LA. The shopping mall is behind the CBS Studios. The restaurants in the Farmers Market portion are excellent and quite varied in their ethnic background. In the summer there will be karaoke or bands. In the grove portion there is also occasionally well known bands and celebrities. The movie theater has assigned stadium seating. Across the street is Pan Pacific Park where you can for a nice stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OracleLosAngeles
30,Shopping,I liked the Grove but I was really not impressed if you are used to outdoor shopping. Its fun but Melrose was a great Cali expierance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaquelM184
40,Very Good,"Nice place, feels like your somewhere in Europe rather that America, set out beautifully and next to the farmers market with some great food and shops.Their is an old fashioned trolly/tram which we did not use because it was not that big you can't walk but made nice photographs. We didn't know it was there, we hopped off the hop on hop bus and spent about 4 hours looking around and was so glad we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donna1981xx
40,Fun & Interesting Place To Spend The Afternoon,"You must visit this place once while in Los Angeles. It is close to the CBS Studios, and home of the Farmer's Market. You can shop, eat, enjoy people watching and maybe even get lucky enough to watch the taping of a TV show. We actually saw a couple of shows being taped while we were there. I recommend going during the week, even though it is still crowded you will be able to move around a little better than on the weekends. Avoid the chain restaurants and eat at the Farmer's Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennesseeTravelQueen
40,Trendy and Nice,"The Grove Mall is a very nice mall with lots of great stores and restaurants (except the Fat Cow, see my separate review on that restaurant). However, we went to the mall on a Saturday afternoon, so it was very crowded. It took us 30 minutes to find a parking spot. We were there for 6-7 hours and the parking fee was $12.50 (after a discount because we went to the movie theater).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleAntoinette
50,Best Place To Be,This is one of the best malls in LA. This is an outdoor mall that leads to the farmers market that has a wide variety of restaurants and great food choices. This is a most do when in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brightsmile1
40,If you love shopping... This is the perfect outdoor mall for you.,"First time we've been to The Grove. Plenty of shops if you like that kind of thing. Banana Rep, Topshop, Nordstrom, Crate&Barrel, Nike etc.Really strange outdoor mall vibe that has a fake street and old style tram running through the lane. Plenty of places to eat.We opted for a place in the Farmers Market at the end of The Grove. Some really nice places to grab great food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TIpperGee13
40,Great place to spend a few bucks.,"This place is worth the trip. I do recommend getting there earlier than the crowds. I went there around 11 on a Friday, and by the time I was leaving around 12:30-1:00 it was getting pretty packed. The evironment is welcoming and the stores are better than most ""Premium"" outlets. There are sidewalk vendors, but not too much. The Farmer's Market was great as well. Parking was a breeze (if you get there early). Overall, I will return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/602Traveler
40,"Faux urban experience - but hey, it's LA!",A very popular shopping center near Hollywood. The best part of the Grove is the adjoining historic Farmer's Market. The owners have done their best to keep most big chains out of the Farmer's Market. Many of the vendors are the same as I remember from my childhood back in the 70s. The Grove is an adjoining upscale life-style mall filled with national high end retail chains. I would recommend both attractions if you are a tourist visiting Los Angeles. They are top notch venues for people watching. Eat at the Farmer's Market and avoid the big corporate restaurants at the Grove.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820KurtB
50,Perfect Outdoor Shopping Experience,"I love The Grove. Yes, it's hip and trendy, and I know that's not for everyone, but for what The Grove is... Hip and trendy is spot-on. There's a good selection of shops and restaurants, but it's really more about the atmosphere and experience. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours outside , enjoying the fantastic weather LA has to offer, and there always the possibility of a celebrity sighting as an added bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chel-belle

50,Loved it!,"I visited the Grove at Christmas Time and the decorations were beautiful!! When we were there Topshop but being built but I know that it has now opened. The water fountain and the garden area was lovely.We ate at Cheesecake Factory which is now one of my favourite restaurants. We did have to wait 25 minutes for a table but it was worth it! Other shops include American Girl, Dylans Candy Store, Sprinkles Cupcakes, Barnes and Noble & Gordon Ramseys Resaurant.We visited The Grove at night time and although it was cold there was a magical feeling about it!!! It's great for people watching! The farmers market is also worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dani_lea
40,interesting place....,We strolled through The Grove and window shopped. The stores are like most upscale mall stores. It's also next to the Farmer's Market and CBS studios. Worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenflady
40,Fun just walking around,"Right next to The Original Farmers Market (which is a fun stop), this is a great place to shop and wander around in. The upscale shops make for great people watching. For us this isn't a destination in itself, but a fun add-on to the market experience. Parking is tight, and make sure that you get your parking validated as it is much more expensive to not (don't lose your ticket -- $20 to park if you do, or $24 without being validated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingfamily003
50,excellent mall,"we love this place , great atmosphere , good parking, excellent stores and restaurantsfully recommend this as a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JACKC821

50,Great place to shop and eat!,"Good luck parking on a busy weekend, but its worth it in the long run! The shops are nice, higher end mostly. The food places are incredible and there is really something for everyone. We were only here a couple of hours, wish we had more time. Maybe next time in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrissyBu
50,Better than it sounds or expected,"Loved, loved this place. We ate at the Cheese cake factory there- WOW! great food and good price. The Grove has so much atmosphere and good shopping too, it is near the farmers market. We went at night- I think that is probably the best time to go for the atmosphere. Lots of places to eat or just to walk around the fountain stop for a coffee and soak up the happy vibe of the place. I miss it already!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/click11
50,Can't be missed,"If you can handle LA traffic you'll love The Grove. Fashioned after Disneyland's Main Street you'll enjoy walking down the shopping corridor with no cars in sight. People yes, cars no. A bit expensive to park, but otherwise great shopping, movies, and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GEOAHC
40,Food critics heaven!,"Great outdoor eateries...so many choices. After you're done walk The Grove for some shopping...a bit high-end shopping, but still fun to see. The only thing I didn't like was the parking situation...too expensive for my taste...the outdoor market for food choices was great, but over priced...almost $14 a plate...fried food at it's best...great outdoor entertainment..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy_colts2009
50,Fun in the outdoors,"Where else but LA can you go to a shopping complex and see a tv show being shot. Was at The Grove and Farmer's Market in February. Watched the taping of Extra, and actually got the prize of the day.Started off with breakfast at the Marmelade Cafe. Then off to watch some of the filming of Extra.Then it was time to shop and visit the Farmer's Market. Since it was a beautiful sunny day, it was nice to be able to walk outdoors.A must visit when in LA.Yes the parking was expensive, but I am sure you could park on the street for less if you so desired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynnerz
40,expensive parking i have to mention first!!!,"however the complex itself is beautiful, lots of nice scenery to take photos as well and the farmers market is next doorthere's also a cinema and lots of guards around so you feel very safe as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babyangel2007
50,"A Haven, an oasis in a cultural desert!","The Grove gets better every time we visit, although due to it's popularity parking is starting to be an issue. It's location joined onto Farmer's Market and just across the street fom a Wholefoods only increases its value! One of the most comfortable outdoor shopping experiences on the planet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidHBlair
40,Bustling outdoor mall,"The Grove has a variety of stores: Banana Republic, J Crew, the Gap, etc. It's a pleasant area to stroll around. There's a center water fountain that kids and adults will enjoy. There was a live band playing on the lawn during our visit. Look for the cute ""lemonade stand"" garden statues near the water fountain. A huge line-up outside Sprinkles cupcake shop - must be worth the wait! It's easy to get to by bus - the 217 Metro Local bus goes directly to Fairfax and 3rd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RP_traveller_2013
50,Great extension to the Farmers Market,"Great extension to the Farmers Market. I was concerned when they tinkered with the Farmers Market by adding The Grove. My favorite addition was the parking structure. This makes parking easier. The shops are interesting and the restaurants are good. But to me it is just an extension to a great place, the Farmers Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,The flip side of the Market,"The Grove shares the block with neighboring Farmer's Market, but that's where the similarities end. While the Market is definitely old school, The Grove is contemporary chic.Built by same developer as the Americana Brand in Glendale, you can see how they mirror each other. Trolly, check; high-end shops, check; park-like setting with fountain, check. There is a resemblance to King Street in Charleston, SC so a big plus for that but a minus for the limited store offerings.Being close to Hollywood and all, this place gets a lot of attention...good for business, but not so good for the wallet! Another people watching, window shopping destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog
50,Great shopping mall,"The food court has just about any cuisine you might want, priced reasonably . All the high end stores, and celebrities supposedly shop here too. Usually some type of entertainment going on so it's fun. Be prepared to walk a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dvyoral
40,"Good shopping, dinning and free views","An upmarket open air shopping mall - with shops like Crate and Barrel, Topshop and one of the biggest A&F in LA. it's worth a trip even if you only go to the top of the car park and look at the views (Hollywood sign) and views to down town and Century City. Not as good views as going to the Observatory up on the hill but easier if short of time. Park opposite in CVS car park free for 1.5 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934grahamp
40,"Nice place, a little pricey","I like the grove, specially the farmers market and Barnes and noble. The bookstore has a lot of great movies and cds!!! On weekends is a little too crowded. The movie theater is also cool. Some stores are to expensive... if I want to shop I walk or drive from the grove to the Beverly center, is only a few minutes away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245pattiv
50,Nice outdoor hangout and shopping area,"I spent about 3 hours at the Grove by myself, and had a pretty enjoyable time. There are some great stores here, all of which were kept pretty clean. Right next to the Grove is the old Farmer's Market. This is a great historical sight with lots of food vendors. They also happened to have an outdoor concert on a small grassy area while I was there, but I'm not sure if this is a common thing or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41RenaL
40,Well worth visiting,"I am a regular visitor to Los Angeles. The Grove was new to me. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The market was good to browse, behind the market all the well known stores. A good day out. Equal if not better than Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CambridgeMuriel
50,"Fun, upscale shops, farmers market, good food","The Grove is an eclectic mix of a funky farmers market mixed with a faux European town shopping center. It's crowded and noisy but its a lot of fun and there is great shopping. High end shops are just steps away from butchers and fishmongers. Various bands blast out danceable tunes and a family atmosphere prevails. You might see a d-list Hollywood type but mostly you'll see locals who come to eat, shop, listen to music and have fun. Parking is tough but once you're there, you'll be there for hours and enjoy yourself immensely. Don't miss this fun LA attraction. It's a great way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiesmagic

Holiday lighting had just come down, but was told how beautiful it looked. Variety of food choices from the adjacent Farmer's Market which also has lots of specialty shops.

50,Great mall during Christmas,"This is a high end mall area, but was decorated very well for Christmas. The band on top of the trolley was a very nice touch and the Santa's house in the middle of the mall area was already very beautiful.We thought we might see them filming Extra while we were here, but they were on hiatus. We did not come here to shop, but mostly to look around and have dinner and it was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormanM341
50,I. Love. The. Grove.,"So happy I made sure to visit The Grove a few times while I was in LA. So many fantastic shops. When I was there, there was a live band playing in the courtyard one night as the sun was setting. Just a cool LA place. You have to go. Grab food at Planet Dailies, save room for dessert at Fat Cow, do some shopping at Nordstrom. It's fantastic and worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovesLondon415
20,Disappointed!,"A couple of friends suggested we stop at the Grovewhile in Los Angeles. Promises of great people watching, and good food choices.Interesting views of food choices but not the friendliest place for someone with food allergies.The shop's were overpriced, with not great selections of anything you can't find Leeds expensive at whole foods. Really sad.Not a great place...and there is NOT lots to do. A waste of time to drive to, parking was $20!!!! And two glasses of wine at a bar in the area was$45 before tip! For what????Don't bother. Stop over at Melrose and walk around. Much more for your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmenDPhoenix_AZ
50,Shopping Mall like no other,"I always love taking a trip to the grove when visiting LA. It's like the Disneyland of shopping malls.

50,"Try the Grove on ""off hours"" to avoid the crowds - Valet parking is worth it","We love the Grove for the shopping, food and overall outdoor experience -- especially at Christmastime. However, we have alos learned to go -- mid-week or ""off peak hours"" to make the experience more enjoyable -- it can get crowded on weekends. In any event -- valet parking is worth the cost -- especially when you plan ahead and eat at one of their on location restuarants -- Like Maggiano's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1222JeffK

Check my flickr, Scoop_Photo for all the coverage of their concert. The stores were great. So many places to shop and spend money. The market is the place to eat. Try the Brazilian BBQ.

50,"Beautiful, magical place","It's already Christmas at the Grove in mid-November. This medium-sized shopping/dining/cinema centre has a Santa cottage, red and green lights on the palm trees, thousands of mini-lights on all the trees, a giant decorated tree in the central plaza with Santa, his sleigh and reindeer flying overhead. Crooner-style carols sound softly in this beautiful place; the holly-wreathed streetcar dings as it gently goes down the main street. Suddenly as the song ""Let it snow"" begins, it really does start snowing! Hidden valves on the roofs of the stores spray soft white bubbles that swirl around the shoppers - little kids open their eyes in wonderment and start running through the storm, arms raised and squealing with joy. Los Angeles I love you; you do winter so much better than Canada! 70 degrees, shorts and t-shirt makes a snowstorm seem so much easier to handle. Go to the Grove, you won't regret it.Tip: Eat at the Farmer's Market food court next door to the Grove - more choices than you can remember, all at reasonable prices.Tip #2: Go inside the cinema building just to see the soaring ceiling and art deco design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccvvbb

50,A great way to spend time!,"My wife and grown up children spent a full month in LA. We stayed across the Grove, at the Palazzo Apartments. It was an excellent choice because most of the things we needed were nearby. There was the Farmer's Market where breakfast was a whole gamut of great choices! Lunches and dinners were also catered too by very good restaurants. My daughter enjoyed watching the taping of the TV Show, Extra, extra! Which was being done in the Grove! Shopping was good. Nordstrom, Apple, Nike, and many, many more shops were there. I was even able to see 8 movies at the Pacific Theater, while whiling away time after lunch!I used to stay in Pasadena for my California visits, which is also a great place to stay, by the way, made even more special by their new iPic movie house!

It's perfect to be outside for part of the time, especially as the shops have great aircon, you can wander around and eat outside in a restaurant or cafe to refuel In-between shops. Personally I spent most of my time in Abercrombie & Fitch due to the gorgeous guys working there. The manageress was lovely as well as efficient, she went out of her way to make our purchases easy & fun. It's hard buying for other people but the ""models"" helped us out. There's lots of stalls as well as the big stores and they were filming a fashion shoot whilst we were there, which was fun. Well worth a visit if you're nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaMojo

The wheat intolerant (child) we had with us was given alternatives for meals by the wait staff (who were polite and professional), the children were given crayons and pencils to colour a ""menu"" set before them. They were entertained and amused and found the restaurant toilet somewhat of an attraction (can't think what made them go 3 times!). However, they enjoyed their meal, my sister and I enjoyed the house wine and off to the movies. Can't say I enjoyed the bus ride back to Hill and 2nd from there -at night, but we were safe and walked off a few calories back to the hotel. Worth a visit. Very attractive shops and location is decorated up with lots of flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChosenN
40,Everything you could ever want!,"By the time I went to The Grove it was almost lunch time. There were a lot of people, the sun was nice and foods, boutique shops scattered everywhere.

Table everywhere, people just walking right pass you and restaurants are all over the place. It was so hard to choose what particular food or taste I wanted coz there was just a whole lot of variety to choose from. What I love most about the concept is the happy energetic vibe of every single person that visits The Grove. I absolutely love the dessert of one store (I forgot the name) and I enjoyed picking fruits from a market also located inside. Shopping was great, too!

There is a beautiful old-fashioned Tram that runs down the main street. It was magical. The shopping was fair (names you know like Abercrombie & Fitch, Anthropologie, Victoria's Secret, The Chessecake Factory etc.) but the real attraction is the overall ambiance and landscaping including an animated water fountain/show. It borders the Original Farmers market. There is an outstanding view of the area, including downtown from the roof top parking.

50,A must visit!,"If you ever plan to visit Los Angeles, you should plan to spend your afternoon at The Grove/Farmers Market. I first heard about this place because I used to attend the Harry Potter Book Meetup when it was still in its existence. Today my husband and I would endure 45 minutes in traffic just to have lunch at the Farmer's Market. There are so many delicious eateries to choose from in the Farmers Market. I have a thing for Asian flare so I love getting the Korean BBQ combo at LA Korea. Afterwards I finish it up with dessert by ordering nutella crepe at the French Crepe Company. They make the best crepes ever! Get there early because the wait is long. I would buy a box of French macarons at Normandie Bakery. Their macarons even taste better than the macarons that I tried in Paris, France. If you take your time looking around the Farmers Market, chances are you'll find something that you'll love. Farmers Market is not a place that deserves to be rushed. It's a place for you to take your time and relax.Although the shops at the Grove might be pricey, I actually come here for the food at the Farmers Market. Shopping is entirely optional. I love strolling around and enjoying that ambience once I'm done with eating. I also like to browse through books at the 3-story Barnes & Noble Bookstore. (I went there for the midnight release of the last Harry Potter book. It was insane but fun.) This is a fun place to hang out with friends and family. I enjoy taking pictures in front of the fountatin. If you come here during Christmas, they'll have a beautifully decorated Christmas tree all light up!The only drawback about this place is that you have to pay for parking. You can only get validation at a Grove retailer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chochang77

We certainly couldn't see what the fuss is about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raspberryduchess
40,Great Place to hang out/eat; Not my shopping choice though,"Love the atmosphere. Great ambiance, great noise level, awesome summer night place to see a movie, I prefer the Beverly Center, Century City or Santa Monica Place when I do my shopping. Be prepared for parking rates. Also keep in mind that not all restaurants validate for the parking structure or the Farmer's Market parking.

A movie theater, good restaurants, great shopping, and just a nice stroll window shopping makes this shopping center an amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/internationalwonders
40,people watch!,"extremely cutesy and gorgeous for people watching on a nice sunny day. coming here is an experience because the stores are closed from traffic (almost all of them are) and it's outdoors. definitely hworth a trip even if you have no plans to shop here since all the stores are the same, nothing too special but who knows, maybe you'll get in the mood to shop around. the garage is free for the first hour and $3 for 2nd/3rd hours, discounted if validated from CERTAIN stores only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasli
40,Everything you would be looking for,"Great shopping and plenty to see and do. All the favourte stores and there are lots of places to eat and drink. We had a short visit on a tour but made our way back for a morning of bargain hunting and sight seeing. Its in the thick of it so you can work it into any LA sightseeing day, but it is a shopping highlight of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_odwyer
40,A must see,"Take the time to check this area out --- yes they have numerous chain stores (J Crew, Banana Republic, Cheesecake Factory, etc), and the Italian place in front of the fountain is HORRIBLE so save your money. My favorite was the indoor food hall with so many wonderful and yummy options. The highlight being the French/European Market (forgot the name). It even carried Pici pasta --- a total rarity outside of Tuscany, can't even find it in Rome or Milan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcgalesq
50,The Grove,It was Excellent!! The staff were friendly and helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiFrisby
50,Beautiful Shopping Area,"Went here and ended up being in the audience for ""Extra"" and even got a great gift for being there. Take the trolley for fun, and then end up in the Farmer's Market for some great food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteC918
50,Worth the visit,"We visited The Grove early on Saturday just as everything was beginning to open. It was quiet and peaceful; great place to take pictures (beautiful fountain with a bridge.) The Farmer's Market at one end had a large variety of produce, meats, coffee & bake shops and even a shop just for pets.We went back Sunday evening and it was a buzz of people...quiet different than the early morning - but it was just as beautiful in the evening. And though it was full of people it never felt overcrowded - still a very relaxed atmosphere.The Grove is very clean with beautiful structures, and a wide variety of unique shopping and various sorts of restaurants. We had an early dinner at the Planet Dailies - the freshest, yummiest :) food I had while in LA. Check them out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkg746
50,Not typical American Mall,"This is probably the most beautiful mall in America, at least among those 150+ that I have visited. During Christmas time it is nicely decorated open air area. That time atmosphere is wonderful with songs played etc. Some shops are bit high end, but you can always cross the street to Ross then. Area has several nice restaurants and is attached next to Farmers Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mWrite
50,It' s a shoppers disneyland,"If you love to shop this is a beautiful mall, outdoors, upscale shops and a movie theater. Cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/istanbulrocks
30,Pretty shopping centre,"I went to the Grove today and the first impression was that it is a very pretty place to visit. It has a water fountain that keeps young kids entertained for a little while and it has music playing throughout the centre. There are a couple of coffee shops and a variety of different shops including clothes and accessories for your home and it has bookstore with a Starbucks. There is also a cinema in the centre of the street. I was quite excited to go because of all the reviews on here voting it the best shopping place to go in LA. However, I was quite disappointed. Yes it is very pretty, but I felt like there wasn't a great amount of shops there, and the shops that were there we're aimed towards those customers who don't see money as too much of an option. I mean I'm not on an extremely tight budget, but I didn't buy a single thing because everything just seemed too expensive.There is the farmers market right around the corner, and that was quite good to look around, with a lot of local food stalls and lots of little knock knack shops - especially good if you are looking for souvenirs. There is a sticker shop in the market tha is perfect for kids!The cinema in the grove shopping centre cost $13.95 for general admission and they had deals on for people who went before 6pm. The cinema was quite big with comfy seats. Overall, it was a nice place to see, especially if you at e nearby, but next time I think I will be going somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemmatodd90
50,A nice Hollywood style outdoor mall,"we loved this outdoor mall...it was beautiful to walk around in. this was TOTALLY Hollywood-worthy!! Cobblestone paths, trolley service, beautiful fountains, just so nice. Loved the shopping choices. Ate at Cheesecake (get there early before the lines) for dinner and had a great time walking around outside afterwards! Would love to spend more time here next time for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocyomama
30,Nice shopping center,My friend and I were going to a taping of The Price is Right & since The Grove is right next door - we went to see it. It is a nice shopping center but a little expensive for our taste. We had a fun day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanski
50,Don't miss it,Pretty shopping center. If you go during a week day Extra is being taped there. We were happy because they asked us to be in an audience shot for the show. We saw several celebrities that day while they were filming Extra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyCT
40,Can't Miss Attraction,"Great outdoor shopping space. The stores and restaurants are pricey so be prepared to spend. The space is great to just walk around though even if you are not looking for shopping. If you go during a weekday, you will most likely see Mario Lopez shooting his show as it is shot right in the outdoors there. CBS Television City (where The Price is Right and Craig Furgeson show are shot there) and the Farmer's Market are right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/childofcorn
40,great shopping area,This is a great outdoor shopping area. it was a little rainy the day we went so I guess the trolley wasn't running that day. it looks like it would be a wonderful pla cein the summer. i was glad I was able to experience it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparkyttu

Watch/be included in the taping and see some movie stars.The Farmer's Market was fun - huge selection of restaurants and farmer's market fresh produce.Lots of shops in the market, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tofu722
50,this is a must!!!!,"I think someone recommended this a long time ago and I did not have a chance to visit before so this time I decided to visit and I regret not being able to visit before it is beautiful!!!I felt like in an amusement park. The stores are so nice, the atmosphere is incredible. The shops are beautiful (pricy but nice). This is a must if you like shopping in nice areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoreniaA
40,A Bit of the Past in Los Angeles,"The Grove is next door to the Farmer's Market....you don't need a tour, just have fun touring on your own....or with a group....or just do your marketing there. Built in the 1930's as a ""farmer's market"" and farmers from all over the area brought their produce there. Now it is great for locals for fresh ingredients for your favorite dish, fresh fruits and vegetables and fun dining...also great people watching. During the week you will find writers, directors, producers and even actors having great discussion over coffee, right in front of the doughnut shop. Great doughnuts too!! Wander the isles and enjoy the days of the past. If you have shopping in mind, the Grove is adjacent fo the Farmer's Market and has all of the chain stores with the hottest merchandise and for those with kids...an American Girl Store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindat853
40,Nice!,Nice place to go for shopping and for food. The market near the Groove is a very nice place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrela11
50,"Fantastic atmosphere, something for all ages","I wish had given myself more than 2 hours to spend here at The Grove on my recent stay. It had probably more atmosphere and a pleasant experience than some of L.A's other attractions similar.From live music playing outdoors, full restaurants with happy people, loads of different shopping for all ages, small stands...it really had something for everyone.I received excellent service from a little Greek Dining place, the Apple Store, Zara, Banana Republic and a little jewellery stand.A few steps away is the Farmer's Market which in itself had so much choice for fresh food and the smells were incredible!Easy parking, very clean areas, good security and plenty of staff around made this a wonderful place to visit.Barnes and Noble often have celebrity book signings and Mario Lopez films his extra show from here also (neither happened on my stay though)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jinxyoz
50,"Great Shopping, so fun!","The best part besides the KILLER SHOPPING, every store you want! Farmers market is right there, creating a great scene for fresh everything, great places to eat cheap. Bravo. Done right, done once, you will remember it and love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjarvis
40,Always a fun experience,A quick trip from San Diego for a couple of days during Spring Break. The kids (ages 16 and 18) really like to window shop here. Proximity to the Farmer's Market is great and provides a HUGE variety of food. The pond/grassy area is always nice and the 3 level Barnes and Noble is a real treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redpatch7
40,Saw Mario Lopez,Awesome place to look for celebrities saw the paparazziAnd they tape the Extra show there daily,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IBBETSY_11
50,Such a cool shopping experience!!,Definitely loved this outdoor shopping mall. It is supercool because you go through the amazing Farmers Market and then you really get your shop on. Original finds with the kiosk venders too. I especially loved the little onesie I got for my chihuahua that read: I love LA.. so cute. Get your cameras out too cuz there is amazing photo ops as well. The nice thing about it is you can take your time and amble from shop to shop and get fresh air at the same time without being confined to an indoor mall for hours.It was also great to see some favourite restaurants as part of the whole Grove experience. My two favourites were there so I was one happy camper. Abercrombie got me all my skinny jeans and the always wonderful Cheesecake Factory made sure you left happy. Fantastic afternoon of shopping and dining I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cujoetta
40,Love this place,"I have been here a few times now and love the atmosphere, some god restaurants and shops and there is the farmers market too worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulainwales
40,Not what I expected but good anyway,"The Grove is an open air shopping mall with lots of upscale shops, plenty of eateries and a good place to people watch. The Farmers market is not what I would term a farmers market but more LA styled. Good place to spend an hour or two and unload some money in the lovely shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AarondQueensland
50,A lively place to shop and people watch.,"A very clean, conveniently placed shopping area with everything you could wish for. Barnes & Noble and the Apple Store were my favorites. The Cheesecake Factory was great for either Lunch or Dinner. It's also good for just sitting and watching the World go by (and David Spader).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucavigg
50,Great shopping experience,"The Grove is in my opinion the best shopping center in L.A. Not only is there an excellent section and mix of shopping and good dining places, but the entire atmosphere is very relaxing and takes you from a big city to a small city square, the way we Europeans know it. Unlike the traditional shopping mall in the U.S. the cars are stored away in a spacious parking house in one end of the area and you can stroll in the streets, like in a small town. When visiting end October, beginning November we were impressed by the beautiful Halloween decorations and everything else contributing to a relaxing shopping experience. The Christmas decorations, with the majestic Christmas tree are impressing. There is a very nice, old street car, taking you from one end to the other of the street. If you are into shopping or not, you can easily spend half a day at the Grove. This is probably not only the best shopping experience in L.A., and even the more recently constructed shopping centers and malls in L.A. are by far not that good. Next to the Grove there is the Farmers Market, with a large selection of eating places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mietzner
40,"Fun day, cool farmers' market",Beautiful weather made for a nice day at The Grove. The farmers' market had incredible smelling food and great looking veggies and meat cuts. The place had nice stores. There was a band that played oldies in the courtyard that made for a nice touch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TyL483
50,Open air shopping and dining,"I've been to LA numerous times but this is one of the best places I've visited. I come to LA for conferences, meetings, and work and am always looking for things to do after conference meetings all day. Visiting the grove and the open farmers market was perfect. It allowed the groups to shop, enjoy the warm LA weather, have a variety of restaurants to choose from and just stretch our legs for a few hours.There are high end shops and shops like GAP, jcrew and anthropology. Simply the best place to roam around while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmtip
50,Shopping,"Beautiful venue, great shops as well. Had a great time, lots of fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirleyP378

50,Mall experience,"Nice mall with good stores, parking and concierge.Spent a couple of hours at Nordstroms and Bloomies. This is where Mario Lopez films his show and the Farmers market is there too. Fun and easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCR_12
50,Great Outting,"Had a good time. Even though i live local it was my first time. Great atmosphere. Nice outdoor shopping and dinning. Right next to the farmers market which is great. Bands play there also. Kinda reminds me of the markets in Barcelona,Spain. Will go again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sun5hine56
50,Upscale to downscale,"You can take your pick of the casbah-like warren of little 3rd world type eateries (some are VERY good.) or walk beyond into the pedestrian mall of expensive brand name stores.I'd never been here despite many visits to L.A. and was quite entertained. The name,Grove,does not describe this attraction at all.This is a strolling place with a lot to see that you would not expect to see in a big U.S. city.Good for families, couples or solos. Eat, shop, people watch. A place where many cultures come together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacksmack
50,Celebs!,"Love the feel of the Grove, appreicate the selection of retail and restaurants and we always see celebs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNystedt
40,A little bit of Disneyland in the heart of LA,"If you want to feel like you are on a movie set or walking through Disneyland's Main street, this is comparable. Great place to watch a movie, go shopping and grab a bite to eat, all in one setting. Great landscaping and design; love the clock tower, the daily filming of the Extra tv show, the water fountain and of course the trolley that runs the length of the property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chicago90Phoenix
50,Fun!,"Well worth a visit - typical stores, but the ambiance is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaF790
50,Loved it!!,"We spent the late afternoon and night of new year's eve there. The atmosphere is just so nice! The lighted trees, the water fountain, the Christmas decor and the trolley rides give this place a very special charm. Its closenes with the Farmer's Market makes it even more interesting and fun to spend an entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxinBA
50,Fantastic,"It was our best experience from LA. Cool place with music fontain, tram and good shopping. Recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderB403
50,Beautiful at night,"I had a couple of hours to ""sight see"" so I decided to go to The Grove, it is a beautiful shopping/entertainment center. The fountain reminded me of the ""Bellagio"" only in mini form. The San Francisco style trolley was also a nice touch. There is a huge parking garage and is free when validated by one of the merchants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariamS110JI
50,good shopping but pricey-,i would go to Camarillo outlet for better stores- sorta a waste of time and the cheescake factory restaurant was poor service (had 4 servers that kept switching) and had HUGE portions you can share,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deeferla
40,Nice break from the busyness of downtown,"We were just in town for the day and had a disappointing time at the walk of fame. We pulled in to look around and take a break. We enjoyed a nice lunch and got to do some people watching. They usually tape the tv show Extra there but I think they were off for the holiday. High-end shops are expensive, but still fun to window shop. There is a trolley that runs through the center and it is adjacent to a small Farmer's market. It was a pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelled728
50,Christmas time at the grove is magical,We stayed at a nearby hotel just across the grove and fell in love with the christmas lights and decorations. Ended up heading there every night just to be part of the festivity. There are also good selection of stores and restaurants. This place is a highly recommended visit at night during the December month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickYJC
40,A Christmas experience,"The Grove is an upscale shopping mall, containing most of the shops you typically find in a mall. However, at Christmas the place is spectacular with profuse holiday decorations and entertainment. It gets very crowded but the crowds were not unpleasant. This is typically not my thing, but I liked the excitement of The Grove at Christmas!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idamarie70115
50,Beautiful Christmas decoration,"What a nice shopping outdoors mall. Good restaurants, good shops, a beuatiful courtyard with dancing fountains. Big parking lot and linked to the Farmers Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viajeramx1
50,Beautifully decorated for the Holidays and great shopping,"We went to The Grove on December 19 and the place was like a wonderland. The decorations were outstanding and the ""snowstorm"" was fantastic - it snows there at 7pm and 8 pm. The shops were beautifully decorated for the holidays and the selection of stores was great. The adjoining Farmers Market was filled with food places and the selection was great. The heated market was a good place to have a cup of coffee and warm up. There are also shops in the market for souvenirs and little stuff. It is a great place to walk around and enjoy the area. There is also a large parking garage attached which offers valet or self-park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJBLTB
50,I'll be baack!,"I took a city tour that gave us a half hour to discover the Farmer's Market. The market was great and will definitely want to rediscover this at the beginning of a trip. To my absolute pleasure, I took a wrong turn and discover the walkway to The Grove. WOW!! A quick walk through of the investment opportunities (read shopping!) gave me an andrenalin rush. I was elated to see the mix or large, small and boutique stores available along with popular eateries. There was an added bonus of the Xmas spirit with the decorations, entertainment and Santa! Just stunning.I returned the next day for an evening of shopping - well almost. I took a wrong turn, and once righted minimalized my discovery plans. Nice big Nordstroms, great parking and many areas in the surrounding area to shop, including a big Ross store. I am coming back to the area in January and plan to make this my first stop from the airport. Another friend took my advice and spent the afternoon at The Grove.....and arrived at the airport with a much heavier suitcase.Til we meet again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVC-YYC
50,Shopping California-style,"We had been to the Grove some years ago and joined the member service there. They sent some good offers for my birthday including the valet parking which fantastic - they even have a carwash. The shopping is great, there are lovely restaurants and a cinema and all in the beautiful California sunshine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocBells
40,Worth a visit and great Christmas tree!,"Hopped off our Bus tour here and spent a few hours looking around the shops, ate lunch and had a look in the Farmers Market. The Grove has a nice atmosphere and well worth a visit. We ate lunch in the Cheesecake Factory which was nice and our server was very attentative. Some of the shops are the Apple Store, Nordstrom, Victoria Secret and American Girl. The Christmas tree is great and I was told that on an evening they have 'snow'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pap1973
50,Great spot,"We went on a bus tour and stopped here at the market and the grove was right next door. What a great area with outdoor shops, very clean and the market was spectacular. So much food to choose from. Will go back for sure the next time I head to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D-NYC2011
50,Great and safe nightlife in old/new L. A.,"This is a quick way to take advantage of a little Los Angeles history and cutting edge modern entertainment. The Grove shopping area is unique in that it gives both tastes of the city within a comfortable walking radius. The Grove provides everything from flashy modern shops for fashion and hi-tech as well as restaurants and a nice movie-theater multi-plex. You can also walk to the old Farmer's Market, which is adjacent on the same block. Here is where you get more traditional mom-and-pop's style shopping and eateries...also very delicious and unique. Weekend evenings provide great free entertainment whether it be rockabilly or dancing waters. The parking situation is not that great, but you can find street parking if you don't mind walking a bit. I think you get so many entertainment and shopping options, though, that it IS worth the parking charges. This is a nice 'slice ' of L. A. that can keep you busy for a day -to-night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624
50,Shop till you drop!,"Great shopping with something for everyone. Lots of places to eat -- we had a great, reasonably priced dinner at Maggiano's Little Italy. Located next to Farmer's Market which was also fun to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MacGA

50,Shopping and eating and more shopping and more eating!,"The Grove is great for shopping and even better for eating at Farmer's Market. Lots and lots of people doing lots of shopping and eating. Looking for celebrities? Chances are pretty good you'll see someone here.An outside mall concept with high end stores, American Girl is here, and adjacent to the historical Farmer's Market...perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/writesabit
40,Not your average shopping centre - something for everyone.,"We visited here a couple of times while we were in LA and really enjoyed the experience each time - even my husband who really does not enjoy shopping.There is something for everyone here including a great selection of stores, restaurants and a cinema. You will find some of your favourite stores including Barnes & Noble, Gap, Zara, Nordstrom etc. After shopping you can choose to eat in a variety of cafes and restaurants. Our favourite was Maggiano's, an Italian restaurant with an extensive menu and great prices.The cinema is also great and handy when you need to take a break from shopping.If you can, try and visit during the week. We visited on a Thursday evening and it was much more pleasant than visiting on a Saturday evening, when it was jam-packed with shoppers and quite difficult to get around some areas as it was so crowded.Well worth a visit if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelfromOz

50,Celebrity Catching Glory,In April my family of 4 my family and I went to the Grove it is located next door to Farmer's Market at the Grove there is excellent shopping and even stuff for the kids (trust me heaps for adults heaps for kids) The Grove is excellent for catching celebrities as well when I was there I met Ashley Tisdale at Barnes and Noble ( Barnes and Noble have a lot of celebrities signing stuff so check on their website who is coming) I met Mario Lopez (Extra TV is filmed at the Grove a couple of times a week and we also met Jennifer Lopez on Extra TV and driving to the Grove We saw Charlie Sheen come out of court for the custody of his children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lol89955
50,Great Place to Visit. Absolutely Beautiful,"I visited The Grove this past summer and it was an amazing place to visit. There are upscale stores that are beautiful to look at. They have really good restaurants. Its an outside mall, only better. They had an outdoor movie screening with a widescreen that was really great. Easy parking and the Farmers Market is right next door. If in the area, don't miss seeing The Grove, you won't be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbaram612
50,"Shop, Dine, and see a movie!","If you live in suburbia like me, The Grove will be an outdoor mall that will seem like an amusement park to you! The courtyard has water displays, beautiful gardens, live music, and a trolley that runs the circumference! Good variety of stores! Outdoor cafes, a glitzy movie theatre, and star-watching (Hollywood stars, that is!). Reasonable parking garage and a farmer's market behind the ""mall"". After sightseeing, it's fun to be with the locals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetodance418

Definately worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
40,"GREAT SHOPPING, VARIETY OF ETHNIC FOODS & ENTERTAINMENT","Great place to shop, eat, people watch and get entertained. It's family friendly and lots of things to do and see for all ages. There's a free double-decker trolley bus that just rides up and down the center of the shopping area. Great stores: Nordstrom, Fresh, A&F, Barney's, Nike, etc. as well as several vendors selling lower priced items/toys. It's just a great way to kill some time, walk around, have great conversation, let the kids run around, shop, eat and have a great time. You just may catch a few celebrity sightings as a bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelSnob

40,"Californian outdoor shopping, eating and entertainment complex","The grove area was nicely designed and about the size of most malls but the layout and design was presented in a cool way. Live music rocking in the Californian sunshine while you sip your latte and cruise by the fountains, watched a trolly car go by on your way to eat or buy something was a good experience coming from a north eastern climate. The farmers market with its little crammed in eateries offering foods from around the world was a real treat. We opted for that over the usual chain name brands. Interestingly,we stayed in Glendale and one night went to an area to eat known as Americana which is itself a copy of the Grove minus the farmers market and small eateries. still had the trolly car and other stuff though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aquanirvana
40,A nice outdoor shopping area.,"This mall is close to the heart of Hollywood and is easy to get to. It's outdoor setting is lovely by day and night. With many shops and places to eat it's a good half day out or place to stop for a couple of hours. If you have a dog I recommend the bakery for them there my pups loved it. Although most of the stores are chain stores, such as Victorias Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch, this mall does have a good amount of shops to keep you occupied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahEAKennedy
40,Cute,"It's a very quaint outdoor shopping experience.The people there either have money or want to look like they do so don't expect a lot of smiles.Tons of stores to choose from and the cobble stone streets are cute.If you're there under an hour, parking is free.Also, if you're a fan of the show TMZ, you'll recognize that they capture a lot of famous people shopping here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTaylor7
50,Magical,"This is the cutest shopping / dining area I have ever seen and doubt if anywhere could match it. If Dorothy had taken an alternative route along the yellow brick road I'm sure she'd have ended up here. It is like something out if a fairy tale. I was open mouthed walking about. Even if u are not into shopping (I am and only went into 1 store) just visit, have an ice cream or some cheesecake from the cheesecake factory, sit down and watch the world go by. I will never forget this place whoever designed it is a genius and has managed to create an oasis of calm in a hectic city. The old trolley that runs up and down between the farmers market just tops it off- perfect.They even have a salon for dolls in one of the stores we saw 3 little girls skipping out with their dolls straight into a limo, really felt like I was in OZ then lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinTash
40,"Beautiful place to visit, but not altogether with it","We recently visited The Grove for the first time for a concert. The place was incredible. The italian style architecture and outdoor fountain, were amazing. Many of the seated restraunts had outdoor seating right by the fountain. The old part of plaza, that was the original Farmer's Market, had many other meal options and cute stands. The design for this outdoor mall was very well thought out. This part of our evening was very satisfying.However, those people responsible for organizing the concert were lousy. They were disorganized; posting different start times, then announcing another time the night of the concert, the security guards were misinformed of procedures, opening act didn't show . Making this part of the night not so pleasant.If you are wondering where to go and just hang out, I'd say this place is a great choice for a summer evening. But, if you're thinking to go for a concert, i'd say forget it. It was not worth the frustration.By the way, it's very expensive to part there so be sure to calculate that into your evening expenses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qrandee
50,Love it!,"I think when I miss LA, I really miss The Grove. From the Fountains to Sinatra in the background and the Christmas tree during the holidays. Definitely a highlight for shopping, dining and just hanging out in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BAFoodieMaria
50,Wow! Highly recommended..,"Gorgeous outdoor shopping centre. Has a lake, gardens, restaurants and bands playing. All the name brand shops in a wonderful setting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yippeeholidays
50,"Shopping, Eating, and Stargazing Paradise","The Grove was one of my favorite spots in LA. I loved being in the ritzy, yet casual atmosphere among the nice shops and restaurants. What a beautiful place to browse, starwatch, and relax. The last time we were here we saw Stevie Wonder; this time no star sightings --- You must grab some delicious and surprisingly cheap food in the farmer's market where there is something for everyone's tastebuds. I also found a neat shop called ""Designer Details LA"" that had very inexpensive, trendy purses, jewelry, scarves, etc. Don't forget to stop by See's candy for a free sample of out-of-this-world chocolate! I just wish we would have been there in the afternoon when Mario Lopez was taping ""EXTRA"" with special guests. Something to look forward to next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SZQINSINCITY
50,I wish all shopping malls were like the grove,"Lovely, spacious shopping mall, and the tram is great, it was lovely to sit and watch the lovely fountain display, I can't wait to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viavirgin1
40,Great Atmosphere,"The Grove is a great place to spend a couple of hours of shopping and/or going to see a movie. The stores are all places where average people would shop, although the selection is not as great as some other shopping destinations in the LA area (like the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica).The Grove is next to a farmer's market, which adds to its appeal, and is beautifully maintained, which creates a great atmosphere for shopping or just taking a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustV
50,WOW! Retail heaven!,"If there is such a thing as shopping paradise, The Grove might be it! With shops that the ""average"" person would enjoy (unlike Rodeo Drive and other trendy streets), this is such a fun place! We went there twice in the few days we were in LA. Morel's and The Farm are wonderful restaurants. The Farmer's Market next door is amazing. It is just such a fun place to shop, people-watch, and enjoy an evening. Definitely going to miss not having a Grove at home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetasSodaPop
10,Bad Santa,"Terrible experience at the Grove. The organization of the line in waiting for Santa had 2 different people telling us 2 different things and thus we missed our slot in line. What is the point of having numbered tickets to give out if the numbers dont work? When we finally got in, he ""Santa"" then didnt say a word to the kids at all. Nothing. All he was focused on was pushing the photos & movie The kids were all prepared to tell what they wanted, etc. As any typical Mall santa would offer, but this guy was only focused on pimping photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mootron
10,Santa House - not so good anymore!,"The Santa House was one of the best around, but buyers be warned! They place a logo right in the lower/middle portion of your child's clothing on the photo. They told me I could not buy the photo w/o it on the photo!! Also, if you are interested in purchasing the movie the quality is terrible. I was told they are making them themselves and not using the professional company from years prior. I can barely make out my daughter in the movie nor hear what she is saying. All of this for $50! It's obvious the Grove is more interested in how to best serve themselves then the customer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TKRSantaMonica
40,Pretty shopping venue next to farmer's market,The Grove is a great outdoor shopping centre with slightly expensive stores but the atmosphere is really nice. I enjoyed the World Market at one end which has a lot of great little food products from around the world to purchase and my favourite was the food court area in the farmer's market. Some stores in the grove validated parking but not all which was weird.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vancouverVioletBc
50,Great Food and relaxing,"The farmers market area is an area with a vast amount of great ethic foods. French, Asian, Mexican, Italin, Brazilian, etc...You can find just about any kind of food that you want here. The Grove is more of an upscale shoping area with an open area ""park"" that featured a live band. It was very nice and relaxing. We went on a Friday evening. I just wish we would have set aside more time for this. If I were returning to LA, I would definately go here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bidderman9
50,Great Dining and Shopping!!,Beautiful outdoor shopping area in West Hollywood. Has great restaurants with outdoor dining and nice shops! Nice to walk around on a beautiful day. Right next to the Farmers Market!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mscaccia
50,A Landmark - Must See,This place is beautiful. Attention to detail! Christmas time is the best here. It snows nightly. The Christmas Tree is the tallest I have ever seen. They have carolers that walk around and sing lots of lights and decorations. It will really put you in the holiday spirit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leavingla4indy
40,Fun outdoor stroll,"The Grove is an upscale shopping place with high-end stores & restaurants. But, don't be intimidated because this is a place where families or individuals walk for a fun stroll and sometimes hoping they will encounter a Hollywood actor. There is a water fountain that dances with the playing music and a small bridge by the Pacific theater, like a small version of the famous Bellagio fountain. A lot of people gather around this to watch and be entertained. We did mostly window shopping and took the trolley that goes back and forth from The Farmers Market to The Grove. Our kids love the ride, and the best part, it's free. We will certainly come back, perhaps around Christmas time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PantheraOnca
40,Bring $$$!,"The Grove was basically a bunch of highend stores. They also have a beautiful fountain to enjoy after you're tired of walking and shopping. It's really close to the The Original Los Angeles Farmer's Market, which we enjoyed more...lots of great food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuisAngie05
40,Great atmosphere,"Everytime I visit Los Angeles, I love shopping and hanging out at The Grove. I'm from Holland and we don't have malls or nice stores here, at all. I think the atmosphere at The Grove is amazing - which is a must. I love the stores and the decor. I also like the Farmer's Market and the fact that there's a Starbucks, Coffee Bean, Chipotle and a great salon around. There are not a lot of stores at The Grove, but enough to spend a few hours shopping.The one thing I don't like about it, is the people selling flat irons, bags and all that in the green stands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzabelle85
40,Outdoor mall with great atmosphere,"The Grove is a lively outdoor mall, with plenty to see for most age groups. The farmers market right nearby has loads of shops, cafes and stalls to stop by for lunch, and there are also plenty of restaurants in the Grove itself. (My favourite being the cheesecake factory!)Shops are mid range, found some good deals in the Pac Sun and Victorias Secret there.Definately worth a visit especially if you live outside the US as the shops are all new to us! Also has pretty fountains and nice landscaping. Car park has quite good views of LA also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zulucherry
40,Its just a mall...,"The Grove is a very nice mall to be sure, but its just an outdoor mall. From a shopping standpoint, there's really nothing here that can't be found at most any other mall, with a few notable exceptions (American Girl for one). Most every other store here can be found elsewhere. Granted, the design of the mall, the decor, and the layout are all very nice, and it still has a new-ish feel to it. The fountains are cool too, but they're just fountains, not that big a deal, IMHO. To me, the real attraction of the Grove is that its adjacent to the Farmers Market, which beats the food court at any typical mall by a considerable margin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MachThree
20,A HUGE letdown!,"A guidebook said that this was Vegas-style and glitzy, etc. The parking was outrageous...also, there was really nothing special about the mall. Sure, the kids may love the fountains, but take them to the local park.We're from Chicago, so this mall was just like (probably not even as nice as) our local outdoor malls. Maybe this would be semi-exciting for someone from a small town or who has never really explored a big city before. But we wouldn't suggest it, especially if you're from any competant big city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thetravelin3
40,Great place,I had a great time just walking around and enjoying the scenery. My son loved the shooting fountain and bridge. Very clean and had a fun time. Good shops and restuarants. Parking quite expensive. Paid 20 bucks. Pretty steep.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanja39
50,Love the Grove,"I love the Grove. Parking is plentiful and rates are reasonable. Plus, shopping is fun. I love the American Girl Place. My kids enjoyed the movies, lunch, shopping, and the large bookstore! It was plenty to do. Plan several hours. I think we spent over 3 hours alone at American Girl place! Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbrzez
50,charming shopping,"If Downtown Disney had half the charm of the Grove they could close the parks and run on it alone. Fortunately, we have the Grove which beats the trend toward all teenage malls with no flare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kronos_7
50,really nice shopping area,"We spent some time walking around the Grove and Farmer's Market after going to the Price is Right (at CBS Television City, which is next door).It is a really nice area, and it has some unique shops and restaurants. The fountains and gardens are really nice as well.They do the Grove up big time for Christmas. They had Santa's house, a large tree, the sleigh and reindeer flying through the sky. It really had a nice Christmas feel to it.You probably won't need a whole day, but you should definately check it out for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobOnLocation
10,awful!,"I took my family to the grove last night plus some family friends. Andrews security put up a barrier and wouldn't let me past it to get my kids after we split up to see the gingerbread house, tree, shops, etc. Thousands were there and they were herding them like sheep, and people were packed like sardines. I said my kids where on the other side once again and if he wasn't going to let me go get my children then he could. He said he didn't care. After about an hour, i got my kids and we left as fast as we could. We never saw the tree lighted. I had been going up to the farmer's market for 45 years and the grove also since it was built.We will never go back. The security, manhandling, cold hearts; awful place for a family to spend an evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joe4dodgers
50,What a Beautiful Surprise!!,"My family and I visited The Grove in June 2006 to go to the American Girl Place. What a beautiful surprise! This outdoor mall is gorgeous! The dancing fountain was fun to watch, and the trolley added to the enchantment of the mall. The American Girl Place is a very special place for girls to visit with their family and dolls. There was a good variety of other shops too. It was so sweet to see all the girls with their families walking around the mall holding their American Girl dolls. We snacked at the Haagen Daas vendor, and had a delicious lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. We also visited the Farmers Market and enjoyed the quaintness of the market. We spent about 4 hours at The Grove in the morning, and definitely hope to visit this beautiful mall again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmjh02
50,Gorgeous during Christmas!!,"The pics attached are taken Dec 2005.I live in LA and I really enjoy going to The Grove. But it takes me about an hour to get there, so I don't get to go as often as I would like. The outdoor shopping is always fun, the shops they have are ok. Not a huge variety, but you can still make a dent on the credit card there :-)But I love going there during Xmas, its just so festive! They have this fake snow that blows from the top of the roofs twice a day. The decorations are so great, even tho I live in sunny CA for those few moments it just feels like I'm a world away. The trolley that takes you up and down the street is really cute, you almost feel like you are in a Disneyland of sorts ... without all the characters.As far as food I agree with the other reviewer I would stop off at Farmer's Market they have all sorts of food from almost every country! There's also a Cheesecake Factory there, but BEWARE of the wait. But what Cheesecake Factory have you been to that doesn't have a wait???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bebe624
50,very very beautiful,"a very very beautiful outdoor mall, i watched a movie there with my friends and did the most shopping out of my 11 days trip! there are lots of jewlery shops and vintage shops, it was close to the farmer's market so u are actually going to two places at the same time. it would be best if u are going on a weekday because theres lots of tourists on weekends. i bought a lot of stuff there and everything was great. it's a place u def cant miss!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frosty205
50,A Beautiful Outdoor Mall...,"The Grove is a new outdoor mall at 3rd & Fairfax Ave. It's interesting and fun...built in the style of an Italian palace. There is a lovely, dancing fountain and pond with koi and sculptures. Also, there is a free, double-decker trolley that you can ride from one end of the mall to the other. There is a theatre multi-plex where you will feel like you are inside of a palace in Italy.The restaurants at The Grove are somewhat pricey...but it is located right next to the famous Farmer's Market. At the Farmer's Market there are plenty of cafes and restaurants to fit every budget...and every type of food imaginable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveLA
