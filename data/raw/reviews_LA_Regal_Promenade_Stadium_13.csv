50,Great theater with plenty of room,"I have been to this theater several times, most recently this past week. It is clean, great staff, good sound and screen, seats are very comfortable and recline, parking is plentiful and the pricing is competitive. All in all - I have zero complaints about Regal and using their app makes getting seats a snap!",Louise Masin Sattler
30,Nothing Special,"We enjoy going to the movies, and every now and again will splurge and go to Regal. Yes, their seat are comfortable, but their tickets are expensive and seem to keep going up.Waiting to purchase tickets or refreshments are free for all, they used to have roping as a line-guidance, but now it's just people standing and waiting anywhere and everywhere. They never seem to have enough employees working and the waiting can be tedious.",Desiree S
50,Our favorite theater,"We are very frequent movie patrons. Very happy with Regal and the staff. Our go to theater. They have a very good loyalty program, ample stack bar and modern, comfortable seating, latest equipment.",kimrjones
50,"The best seats, power recliners","Love this theater, the power recliners, the large parking lot, good selection of restaurants and regal cinemas rock",jb2real
50,"Can the theater show the movie ""Crazy Rich Asians""?","We always go to this theater. We want to bring a group of friends to see ""Crazy Rich Asians"" as the film got 100% fresh ratings and LA Times devoted almost 5 pages on it.We don't like to go to AMC because AMC is not as comfortable as this theater. This theater has spacious reclining seats and the theater is very clean.HELP! Please add ""Crazy Rich Asians"" to the showings.",AsianAmericanWoman
50,Compfortable and enjoyable,Great reclining seats oh so compfortable. Good time at the movies with my sweetheart. I suggest you try it.,Douglas C
50,Comfortable and clean,"This theater's various auditoriums are generally small-medium size, which is nice for a more intimate, uncrowded feeling. I don't know how crowded the Regal gets, as we usually tend to go to matinees. Typically, there are about 10-20 people in the theater. Further, the theater is clean, comfortable, and each auditorium has stadium-type seating. The seats recline and there are drink holders. Of course, since each auditorium is relatively small, the screens are not huge, which is not a factor for me. It is a pleasant movie-viewing experience at the Regal Promenade.",Bgoodtoall
40,Additional Charge w/ Movie Gift Card,"It is helpful to know that if you are given a pre-paid movie gift card, this theater charges extra because they say their seats are ""premium"" and require an extra fee.Because we have a large family, we left for a different theater.",LivPurple
30,Soso I'd say Jun 2013,"It was ok overall enjoying my theatre near the pacific ocean...however, what I wasn't satisfied was the theatre itself, it was SO DIRTY after the first round of showcase, then the ushers clearly didn't do a good job at cleaning the popcorns nor the drinks. Therefore, it was clearly very bad to have when seeing dirty theatre.",Laxiaozi08200912
40,Just a quick visit!,"Theater is clean, nice and friendly staff. Although the theater is small it is still nice than the big ones but crowded and dirty.",Alaindl
40,Love the seats,This Regal added recliner seats about 2 years ago and they are great. It reduced the total amount of seats so sometimes it's more crowded than it was before the remodel. Typically this location is not too crowded so it makes for an enjoyable theater experience.,PVGreg
50,Movie watching in comfort,"Going to the movies couldn't be nicer. With reserved seating and large lounger chairs, going to the movies couldn't be nicer.",pvmeistrel
50,Relaxing and comfortable,Well this place has it all! The top of the line recliner seating makes you even more comfortable than you would be in your own home.,Dream559413

50,Bringing multiplexes to a whole new level,"For a long time in my world, movie-going was directly proportional to what was playing at the Cinerama Dome, The Village Westwood or the Crest. Unless an IMAX was concerned (or unless I REALLY wanted to see something and I simply had no choice) I avoided multiplexes with the notable exception the Arclight chain, which in the world of multiplexes seemed to be one chain which wasn’t too bad.And then there was Regal.I grew up in an area where it was virtually impossible to travel more than a mile in any given direction without encountering at least one option for movie-going. They were everywhere, like today’s nail salons—and even when I married and moved to our present location, there was there was a drive-in two blocks away, a rundown neighborhood movie house maybe five minutes away and a couple of multiplexes within a three mile radius, all of which have disappeared from the map. Nowadays the chief options for first run films are a part of shopping malls where sound reverberates like a skating rink and you can always find the theatre by following the aroma of popcorn.And then there’s the Regal.Yes, it’s in a shopping mall, but it’s an OUTDOOR shopping mall, which automatically does away with the sound reverberations and popcorn smell. It’s even a PLEASANT shopping mall, so they get bonus points. Parking is free and usually plentiful. That there are 13 screens in the complex means there are decent odds of finding a film which appeals to you.No, I’m not crazy about the noisy arcade which sits in one corner, nor does the availability of Cinnabon Gooey Snacks, “Gourmet” pizza or chicken bites strike me as particular assets. Perhaps there are also a few more tacky advertisements than necessary as you stroll to your auditorium, but all is forgiven as you sink into one of their super-duper cushy recliners, put up your feet and enjoy what’s on the screen. I have to be honest here: I can actually sit through those awful advertisements and film promos when I’m in one of those recliners. I guess that’s the idea.",Gail G
40,Reclining seats,"Love the reclining seats that you choose a seat number. Sorry to see the Tuesday $5 special has been discontinued and price is now $10. Recommend going to the AMC in Rolling Hills Plaza, $6.29 daily before any show starting before noon.",ncjc2013
40,Newly remodeled!,"Neighborhood movie theater that has been newly remodeled with comfortable reclining seats that you can reserve your seats online ahead of time. No longer need to stand in line with hopes of getting a good seat. Buy your ticket onlne and reserve you seat. Use your smartphone to gain entrance. Sometimes there may be someone sitting in your seat, but ask the helpful usher and get a resolution. Not as fancy as EPIC, but really worth trying out!",C T
