40,Not Quite sure Why it is Historic,"I discovered this while driving by several times. I think it is an old rail yard, long and narrow. About the middle of the back side, but on the other side of two chain link fences and two metro tracks is Zanja Madre, the ""Mother Ditch"" that once brought water from the Los Angeles River to El Pueblo do los Angeles. There should be something to explain this but isn't.The park is new. The trees are small. Lots of paths. Two small buildings with restrooms but the Ranger Station was closed when we visited. There is a spiral trail that ends in a low observation platform. Small free parking lot. It is about a mile northeast of El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park, so if you are visiting Olvera Street for history, include this park. The day we visited, there was a car show which we skipped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Large space for walking or running close to Chinatown,We went for a walk after eating and it was refreshing! A very large open space for walking or running or playing. Well maintained and close to downtown and Chinatown. Made by the communityâ€™s help!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
40,Great open space close to downtown,"This was a cute park close to downtown LA with a fantastic view of the skyline! Great, paved and easily accessible paths for running, biking, dogs, and young kids. There's also a great citrus grove with inspirational quotes that are fun to look through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganhQ6393OR
30,Nice outdoor spot,The Los Angeles State Historic Park is a good place to enjoy the sun and the climate while enjoying the outdoors. It has orange groves It's close to downtown and easy to get to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
20,Large Open Space Area but Offers Little,"The brand new park was a noble attempt to turn an expansive unused area into something nice. However, right now, there is not much there. All the trees are still quite small and far apart...it lacks the feel of a real park. However, there is plenty of grass to lie on. The park lies between an industrial area and Chinatown...the LA Metro runs next to it...the whole area is really not very picturesque. Perhaps in 50 years when the trees are bigger and add some character to the area, the park will enter its glory years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
40,"Great place to jog, walk dogs, stroll, picnic, relax.","This newly renovated park cost a cool 3 million dollars. It is a really nice place to spend some time with family or friends, your dog, or just yourself for that matter. When we visited on 6/3, the snack shack was not completed yet, but they are opening soon. You can grab a breakfast or lunch bite across the st. at Nick's, Maybe get it to go and picnic in the park. They hold movie nights there, and bring in several food trucks. There will also be other special events including my car clubs car show in Oct of next year. The only downside I could find was that it costs $8 to park in the lot ($7 for seniors). You can however find free parking on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynW98
