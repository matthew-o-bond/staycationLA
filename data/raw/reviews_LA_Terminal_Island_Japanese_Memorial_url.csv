50,Dark Hour,"I am sorry but I need to use the online words. "" In 1941, 3,000 first and second-generation Japanese made their homes in an area of Terminal Island known as East San Pedro. The Japanese Fishing Village was next to Fish Harbor. Most of the local residents worked in the fishing industry. Approximately 250 fishing boats were owned and/or operated by the residents. Most of the local people, not working on the boats, worked in the many fish canneries that were clustered together on Terminal Island. Because Terminal Island was somewhat isolated, the Terminal Islanders developed their own culture and even their own dialect. The people called their close community village “Furusato” which translated literally means “old village”. An English equivalent would be “hometown”, “native place” or “home sweet home”."" In February of 1942, Terminal Island residents were the first Japanese Americans, on the West Coast, to be forcibly removed from their homes. They were forced to evacuate their homes within 48 hours and had to leave almost of all of their possessions behind including all of their fishing boats and fishing gear. Some were able to sell their furniture, fishing gear, boats and other items. Since the residents only had 48 hours to complete the transactions, they were often forced to sell at ridiculously low prices by greedy individuals taking advantage of the desperate situation.""

50,Difficult to find - easy to remember,"The Japanese heritage in California is deep-seated and, as we well know, sometimes tragic.Located on Terminal Island, basically in the middle of the bustling shipping port of Los Angeles, this memorial is dedicated to the Japanese fisherman and their families that once sailed from this area in search of fishing grounds.Reaching this memorial requires good eyes - the signs directing visitors to the site are small and easy to miss. From San Pedro, cross over the Vincent Thomas Bridge and follow the signs for Terminal Island; from Long Beach take CA 47 west and follow the signs. Once on Terminal Island look for rather small, blue signs pointing the direction to the memorial - if you reach the Coast Guard station/Federal penitentiary area you will have gone too far.Along the face of the memorial are images and inscriptions depicting life in the village the memorial calls to mind. Standing near the memorial brought back memories of our visit to Manzanar War Relocation Camp a number of years ago; both sites commemorate the Japanese experience in California, for better or worse.An important piece of history. Highly recommend at visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvToCruise4001
40,SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT POIGNANT MEMORIAL,"Well off the beat and track is the memorial to the thousands upon thousands of Japanese that were put in an internment camp during WWII. While it is very small, it is quite impactful. Important to spend some time, perhaps call up the details on your smartphone. It is quite a story. Worth the detour and the drive down is quite interesting taking in all the dynamics of the truckers supporting the marine shipping",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,A Memorial Not to be missed.,"It's amazing the history lessons that are available in our various areas of Long Beach.The Lost Village of Terminal Island has been in its location since 2002.FURUSATO - The Lost Village of Terminal IslandThose who came of age during World War II have been called ""The Greatest Generation"". On Terminal Island California, this generation is known as the 'Nisei' - or second generation Japanese, the American-born sons and daughters of immigrant parents.

50,"Overlooked, but not forgotten","On a recent family ""field trip"" our journey led us to an often overlooked site. In short, this memorial was set up to honor the families who lived and worked in the Japanese Fishing Village on Terminal Island.In the early 1940's, a majority of these Terminal Islanders were Japanese Americans working in the once thriving fishing industry. When WWII broke out, they were forced to leave their homes and sent to internment camps throughout the West Coast. Possessions were left behind, and when they returned three years later, everything was either sold or destroyed.What's left today are reminders of the old canneries, but more importantly, a Tori Gate, a bronze statue of the fishermen, and a tribute wall now stands for all the see and remember...always.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog
