50,Most magical place we've visited ever,This is a must-do and must-see experience in Los Angeles and Hollywood. The Unicorn Experience is a place to meet and greet dreamy unicorns and have your memories captured in photography. Instagram moments around every corner. I thought we were going to die of happiness! Better than Disneyland. We arrived via a car they sent for us and checked in. The place has limited parking so they arrange a driver. It was great! We felt like royalty. This is a pop-up experience with live unicorns that are beautiful and friendly. We were shown to a boutique of dresses and tiaras and crowns and even boy clothing we could borrow/rent complimentary for our journey through Unicorntopia as they call it. Our event was at an old Hollywood classic mansion with a beautiful garden. We understand the experience moves from place to place and fills up quickly. It was not crowded and they accept a family every 15 minutes or so. You move at your own pace from unicorn experience to unicorn experience. They have a selfie and professional photography package. We chose the professional photography and we are glad we did. It permitted us to enjoy the experience vs. trying to simply take photos. PM them on Facebook for a reservation like we did. It took 24 hours for them to get back to us but well worth it. They take tour groups too. Lots of people from China were there and loving it. Good for families and kids of all ages. Or any unicorn lover. Very special and better than Disneyland. Go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoverofExcellence
