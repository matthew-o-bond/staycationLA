20,"""The only game in town""","My recent experience with this cab company illustrates why Uber and other ride services are replacing the old fashioned bad companies. I had to go to the local airport. I arranged for a cab to get me there with one hour to spare, and the cab was 15-20 minutes late arriving. What particularly annoyed me was that I called the company twice when no cab had arrived and both times was told by the dispatcher the vehicle was on the way. The cab driver who was unaware of my calls told me a totally different story--that he had just been dispatched.On the other hand, when arriving at Long Beach Airport, there is a long line of cabs available and the provide the quickest and cheapest way to get home.",c263
