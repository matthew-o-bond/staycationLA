30,No parking break for patrons,"We ordered our e-tickets online and also got directions to the theater plus a recommendation to use ""Joe's"" Parking at 530 (next door) Spring St. A validation from the theater, they said, would reduce the parking fee to $5.00. We got our parking stub validated, and were told to give it to the attendant to get the discount. After the play, the ""attendant' was ""on patrol."" He had disappeared, and we had no recourse but to pay the $10 (not inexpensive, IMHO). By the time we got down to the exit, someone else had removed the barrier, so lots of people got to leave without paying at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancypH1670QU
30,Great Venue,"This was a surprise for us; a wonderful theatre venue deep in the heart of Spring Street in DTLA. The theatre was next to an inexpensive parking garage, plenty of restos and bars for pre or post show nosh and several stages within the venue. The theatre we were in was intimate and made you feel like you were on the stage with the performer. I will caution that the steps in the theatre are very, very steep. The venue is in an old bank so many of the early 20th century bank objects are still intact like the grand stairway down to the vault and the actual vault itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
30,No stress movie experience,The Landmark Theatre is a great experience for the working. You need to know in advance that you want to go to the movies so that you can reserve your seat in the theater. You can arrive just as the previews are starting because you already have your seat waiting for you. The prices are a bit higher than traditional movie theaters but it's nice to know you have a seat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMac511
30,Renovations coming,"We attended a dance performance at the Ford - the last event before it closed for renovations and were impressed and excited (first time attendees) by the outside venue, the setting and the staff.We pro-ordered meals which were delicious and reasonable; we got there early to get a table (they filled up quickly or were reserved) and were handled efficiently by the will call staff. Let's hope that the reno's will fix the poor pitch problem in the first 12 rows of seats (it's an amphitheatre and should have great sightlines but doesn't) and also do something about the poor exit from the parking lot which for a tourist was a nightmare getting back southbound after exiting in the dark. As well the concessions and bathrooms were not capable of handling a large crowd in a short intermission. A wonderful experience nevertheless and it can only get better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoBoLasher
