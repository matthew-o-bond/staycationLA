50,Like in movie,So many movies show to us this street. It is so amazing and atmosphere place. Much cleaner then downtown... Haha. We walking around and get very good shopping and fun. Catch the moment for your memory!,Anton K
20,Meh,I don't know what the big hoopla is about this shopping area. Nothing particularly fancy just ridiculously expensive for those foolish enough to pay the price. Didn't happen to see any kind of celebrities walking down the street or anything else of interest for that matter. They're much more interesting things to do in LA,Old Pro
30,Have to see it I guess,Famous Rodeo Dr. In so many movies. It is shopping for the rich and famous many of the stores not accessible for the average joe to walk around and browse. You'll walk up and back in 30mins max. The Beverly Hills sign is close by for a good photo op and we found an amazing little cupcake shop just off the Drive.,Nate B
30,Bling,Beverley Hills is very clean and tidy unlike most of LA and this is their premier road. All the top brands are here accompanied by the usual high performance cars driving round in circles.At least people are walking around the streets there.I suppose if you are buying then the street is great. If not then it’s over in 20 minutes.Nowhere near the same level as Bond Street in London for example.,Epicureously
30,Don't believe the hype,Wasn't that impressed. If you are into labels then it is for you I guess It took us 15 minutes to walk down so we could say we did it,Marcia C
50,Pretty woman,Iconic place to walk around to look around the shops etc. Worth a visit if in LA. Plenty of shops and cafes,agt96
50,Truly like the movies!,"I loved staying to Rodeo Drive - I felt like I was going to the movies. The streets are full of curious shoppers and tourists during the day, and with all the lights, quite pretty.",MatchstickLive
50,Always fun!,All the elegant shops of the world right here on 3 small blocks....fun ti walk down these streets at night as windows are decorated lovely and Rodeo has great median...,Trudi G
40,Rodeo Drive baby,"We visited Rodeo Drive because we wanted to see a classic landmark of Los Angeles, but make sure you've got money to spend if you want to do some shopping!Rodeo drive is clean and well landscaped, with fairy lights on either side of the road. It is full of high end shops such as Gucci and Michael Kors and is a nice place for a stroll and some shopping!I'd recommend visiting as it's nice to see where the wealthy people of LA spend their time, and a different part of the City.",Michael
30,You have to see it right?!,We chose to go early to rodeo drive so that there weren’t too many people in our pictures and we also didn’t need to go into the stores. We got some great photos outside those iconic shops and down the street with very little in our way. It was a nice walk actually and if you do it early you can go on and do other things :),Vanessa M
30,1 hour 30 min visit,"This was an ok experience but there isn’t that much to see. Parked up, walked down rodeo drive, had a coffee sat outside the Wiltshire hotel, walked up to the Beverley hills sign for a photo opportunity and then back to the car.",Cheryl M
30,"Walked the whole length, been there done that","Don't know if it was because of the Stock market crashing that day, but the place was dead. Fancy stores where the average person could not think of affording anything. One good thing, free two hour parking at underground lots that are tricky to find. Go if you must, prepare to be bored.",Cynthia A
50,The finest shops,"If you have the money, there are fewer nicer spots to spend it than up and down Rodeo. All our favorites (Armani, Dior, LV), with great service. The street is clean and well patrolled. Lots of high end cars strutting their stuff. One homeless person blocking the sidewalk was dealt with efficiently.",James B
30,“NICE EXPERIENCE BUT EXPENSIVE”,"Great experience visiting “ Rodeo Drive “ but I guess it’s out of my league , full of designer shops with no customers, very expensive. Nevertheless it’s worth the visit",myfamilylincs
20,Just 2 streets of luxury brands,"2 streets of branded goods, like the Champs-Elysee of Paris / Orchard Road of Singapore.Zipped thru the street to the end where the Beverly Wilshire Hotel stands. This is the iconic hotel where they filmed Pretty Woman. And so many years on, they are still milking the publicity mileage from the movie. Perfect toilet opportunity too haha. Then just opposite the hotel on the slight right is this staircase with a Make-A-Wish fountain and together this forms the Golden Triangle.Prettier at night so go by in the late afternoon, stay thru for sunset then night lights.",dyhx
50,Makes for a nice afternoon walk,"The super glamorous Rodeo Dr sets a beautiful backdrop for a nice afternoon walk. While it’s not a great place for the average person to shop at, it is a great place to take some pretty pictures of Beverly Hills.",Melody F
50,The Rich and Famous!,I can only window shop on this expensive street but it was fun looking at all the stores along the drive.,Aprilla
50,Beautiful Little Walk,"Rodeo is all about the beautiful designer clothes, the beautiful people , the beautiful stores, the gorgeous windows, and the tourists. It’s lined with flowers and tables for watching the glitterati go by. It’s our small 5th Avenue.Everything in very expensive and is really for buying a very special gift, or more likely window shopping. Beverly Hills is a beautiful little City, with lots of fun inexpensive places to have a tea or a drink. Rodeo is fun for walking.",puccibabila
50,A movie spot - do take a walk,"We got there around 10 am and it was quite a delightful stroll, as the streets were not crowded, the stores were open, it was a pleasant sunny day and it was really enjoyable. It is a true movie spot and the original tourist stop, so it is a must-visit, at least once.",Ellie
10,Pretentious and weird.,"Snobs walking around with their noses turned up, scoffing at what they seem consider as riff raff. Stores that won't let you in without doing a credit check. I am not sure what the hype here is, it was a soul-sucking experience (Although in theme with the rest of LA), I am not sure why this piece of trash is considered a tourist place.",polarbear559
40,Do it once,Boulevard stroll at its best. People watching is fun. You’re going to see it all. People who don’t care to people trying way to hard to impress people. Wonderful shopping or trendy shopping if your into that.,Diana G
40,Nice stroll,Rodeo drive is a nice area for a stroll and some window shopping. It makes for a nice relaxed afternoon walking around ...,eurydice2017
30,Boring,"A major yawn. Yes, a ton of brand stores. The street has no energy. Everything is closed at like 6 pm at night. People just look and pass by. Locals rarely shop there. Spend 15 min there and go elsewhere.",Steve g
40,So Great to See in Person,"Made a stop over here while in the area for a conference. It was really great to see in person, so many shops you don't normally see anywhere. Very clean, very picturesque. It was fun seeing all of the expensive cars cruising up and down the street.",Charlie

50,Late night!,Due to the circumstances of my trip I was only able to make it during the evening and it was still beautiful. All the stores were lit up and it was peaceful to walk around. With no other people around we could take pictures as we pleased!,Emily B
50,A must visit while in town.,"Rodeo Drive in the heart of Beverly Hills is super fun. Just park and start walking. Tiffany's is there as well as other jewelry houses and there is also fine dining as well as coffee shops. It doesn't matter if you were on a budget. You don't have to buy anything, it is a lovely walk, the storefronts are beautiful and there are places to have a reasonably priced lunch or simply sit and have some coffee.If you have a difficult time walking there is a tour that you can take, but if you can walk a few blocks don't waste your money on a tour. Simply park the car and walk through the area, much of which is closed off to traffic.If this is your first time visiting Los Angeles I suggest a walk of Rodeo Drive. It is simply a fun time and although a bit touristy, so what, you will have a good time.If you have the funds there are several exclusive shops on Rodeo Drive were you can find designer clothes, jewelry and stunning watches. Cartier is nearby.Have a great time in Beverly Hills.",elizabethlascheid
40,The famous Rodeo Drive!!,"I loved the shops on Rodeo Drive. I loved people watching. And like so many others I was hoping to get a glimpse of a movie star driving by.All I saw was 'someone' in fancy cars driven by chauffeurs.We happened to pass by an art gallery, Galerie Michael, off Rodeo drive, decided to check out out and it turned out to be the highlight of the day.",anita1104
20,Forgettable experience,"Rodeo Drive is just a bougie and pretentious shopping district where people go solely to swagger and make a spectacle of themselves vrooming sleek cars and taking Instagram pictures of themselves in front of brand name stores. Honestly, the people who can actually afford to shop at Rodeo Drive don't -- they watch everyone else pretend to be able to shop there as they languish in their hillside homes and shop online. Unless you intend to actually shop or dine at Rodeo Drive, it's not worth adding onto your itinerary.",June Bug
10,Not my cup of tea,Not really much there unless high end/prices are for u.... not for kids also.... just wanted to really see where Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman ventured.,Simon J
30,"Looking, but not buying","Arrived after 1pm on a holiday. Street is not too crowded. Shops were open. Nice to window shop all the designer clothing. However, nothing for me to buy here. Had to go a couple blocks away to find a coffee shop or affordable store for a tourist.",GiantsFanLosAngeles

40,Perfect for evening stroll,"Took a late night stroll on Rodeo; even when stores were closed it was quite nice.Well it’s fun to people watch and shop during the day we decided to take an evening walk downtown and window shop without the craziness of people and shoppers. It was a nice change of scenery to do that and enjoy a beautiful evening. Street parking, valet at certain locations.",Tiny_Bubbles007
40,Pure Indulgence,"The experience was excellent from driving into the valet parking, which incidentally was excellent and free, to walking around the variety of high end shops. The cars driving up and down the strip were like witnessing a millionaires playground. Unfortunately our visit was short and brief but a worthwhile experience nonetheless.",simonaldworth
50,Movie moment!,"We only visited because of the movie ‘Pretty Woman’ that we love. I’m glad we went, it’s a bucket list tick. A very nice clean area to walk around in a gorgeous sunny day.",Sarah D
50,"Eye coo, to see in person","All the biggest name retailers with flagship stores. We have most of the same retailers on our smaller city, but not with the same flair. This is a spectacular destination to shop or to gawk.",Tom_236598

30,No famous faces,Expected this to drive to be bigger and better than any shopping drive but was average stores and shorter than I imagine. Worse a visit to just walk and take in the world passing you by,shellutd
50,No horses at this Rodeo,My wife and four daughters tricked me into visiting. It was a cool place to wander round but I missed seeing the rodeo clowns.,Kaml128
50,The End of the Rodeo Drive Shops cheaper parking than at 2 Rodeo Drive,"this is the end of the famous Rodeo Drive, it has restaurants and high end shops is located next door to Via Blanca and Beverly Hills Anti Aging which are 2 hot spots for Real Housewife of Beverly Hills celebrities, so while dining ask to be seated on the patio so you can people watch and spot celebrities while you dine, great food and check out those celebrity hot spots as you walk off your meal.",joy7seas
50,Well worth a visit,"Visited with my daughter on Christmas Day & the street was done up beautifully. Lovely ambience with the Christmas music. Enjoyed seeing all the fancy cars, lots of posers & rich people but that's not a negative as per some reviews, that's part of the thrill!!",Mumma&Co
40,Place of interest,"I must say, whilst waiting for my girlfriend I went for a wander around Rodeo Drive. very inteesting with some big name shops like Dubai. Must say though, very expensive so beware. Nice area",Andy M
50,Very fancy,Such a cool place to go and look inside of the highend shop I recommend you actually dress up and look the part and don’t make the mistake of going right after you came off of an airplane! It’s great for the morning until lunch not a whole day thing especially if you aren’t into shopping like me.,Hannah A
30,Not as great as you think,"The walk up and down the street was ok. We visited at night during the Christmas season, so that was nice, to see the lights and Santa Claus but without the allure of Christmas decorating in ten stores and street, not sure I would bother.",Todd M
40,Nice to see in person,It is what it is! A street of high end shops that most people don’t intend to shop at but lovely to walk along and look at nontheless! Was decorated beautifully for Christmas and made for some great photo opportunities.,Ellen M

40,Nice Experience,The street was decorated nicely for Christmas. All the high-end shops are here. You will enjoy strolling on the street even if you don't want to shop. Obviously the shops on this street are beyond the reach of the general public.,Vineet Saxena
30,The famous exclusive shopping street,This a shopping street for those with a thick check book. It is interesting to see the fancy shops but it is a bit out of this world. The lights are pretty though. If you like shopping you probably like all the fancy shops out there.,BeachStone2C
30,kind of cool,"Rodeo Drive is one of those places that you ""have"" to go by and take a look when going to Cali. I found it way to touristy even though I am a tourist. People walking around with their mouths open. The shop keepers seem put out, and the merchandise you can find in stores not on Rodeo. The little shops on streets surrounding Rodeo were more interesting and down to earth a bit more. It is a good place though to see really expensive cars parked and cruising. And the Underground parking is nice",John H
50,Wonderful,We came here on a tour and it was early evening. Christmas decorations were in place and this was a sheer delight to see.Would have liked to spend more time here as so many shops and lots to do.We recommend a visit here and we will definitely return.,Nomad5522
30,Walk on rodeo drive,I felt it is an overrated stretch of high priced stores. Nothing very special or memorable for me. It was also blocked partially for a private event,Sunita V
40,No Surprises,"This was my first trip to LA and of course I wanted to see Rodeo Drive and it was what I expected. All the fabulous high end stores in one location and a lot of people watching. My highlight was buying a YSL bag on Rodeo Drive although we have a YSL store at the mall in my City. Customer service was great in the few stores we shopped in. Although we did a little shopping, it was still a quick trip and didn’t eat up much of our day... all in all I’m glad I can say I’ve been there.",MJ215

It has all your designer needs from Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Rolex, Guess - you name it, Rodeo Drive has it. We even stumbled across a $2million Rolex!Walking from one end to the other doesn't take very long if you aren’t stopping in the shops (perhaps 5-10 mins) so if you're not planning on shopping you probably wouldn't spend more than half a day here but there is definitely a lot to do and see.There are some cute, elegant restaurants spotted around where you can people-watch as you sip on a glass of champagne or plan which window-shopping activities you're going to complete next.Some of the cars you see down this road are incredible, like you've never seen before. It's definitely a place where the rich & famous come to show off their new toys.At the end (or start) of Rodeo Drive, depending which way you look at it, is the Beverly Hills Hotel – famous for its debut in the hit film ""Pretty Woman"". At the other end is the Beverly Hills sign, which guides you to the huge mansions you see on TV.Visiting Rodeo Drive is a must if you are in LA – you won't be disappointed.Instagram: @journeywithuss",JourneyWithUss

It was quiet and the stores were closed allowing us peace & quiet to take photos and window shop. The doorman at the Beverly Wilshire went out of his way to say hello to our teen...which I thought was very kind. We also received hospitality from the group working the Louis Vuitton Exhibition. Keep in mind there are affordable shops in the area if you can’t afford the lavish boutique prices & feel the urge to spend money in Beverly Hills. Fun experience. Will return to dine there one day.",SesameOntario

50,Lovely ride.,"Walking around Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive is very cool, these two attractions are very close to each other, you can walk (650m), we left the car in a parking lot on the corner of Rodeo Drive and Santa Monica Boulevard, so we met Sign Beverly Hills (1303 Park Way, Beverly Hills), then we walk along the beautiful Rodeo Drive, several upscale shops, and you have the Beverly Hills troller, which is a kind of garden bus, to wander around. It has the fabulous Beverly Wilshire Hotel (where scenes were recorded from the movie “A Beautiful Woman”), we entered the lobby, which has a very sophisticated decoration. At the end of the tour, and 250 meters from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, we stopped at Chaumont Bakery and Cafe, located at 143 S Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90212-3002, had already researched this ""bakery"", it was no accident that we stopped there, and it was very good, we had a danish cheese, almond croissants, cakes and pies, and of course, a lot of coffee, just had no brazilian coffee. CALIFORNIA, I will be back soon.",Hilberaldi

40,Great window shopping and people watching,"Of course it is high end and I was not there to buy, but enjoyed viewing the designer shops, window displays and ambiance of elegance. I did spot a few celebrities since it is the weekend of the Emmy’s so many were there. Private luncheons at Tory Burch. I just went and stood where there were crowds and viewed the few celebrities coming out from the stores. Superb cars to look at on the drive. Not a lot of places to eat.",Robin S
30,Expensive shopping,"For me, there was really nothing at the Rodeo Drive shopping strip. Just very expensive flag ship stores and unwelcome looking shopfronts. However a little north of this area, there are pretty nice houses and it is quiet. Well worth the walk all the way to Beverly Hills hotel.",Erkki L
30,Just a road with designer shops,We went here from the hop on hop off bus stop which was quite a walk and google maps is required to find it. It really is just another street of designer shops in a cleaner and less manic area.,GOgirl

50,Loved it - So LA,"Wow there is so much to see on Rodeo Drive. My husband wasn’t sure if the trip would be a little dull. However on arrival he was sold. Don’t get me wrong the shops are super expensive. But just sightseeing and browsing is so much fun!We happened to bump into a Louis Vuitton exhibition which is on for I think one more month. It was a free exhibition showcasing lots of clothes worn by celebrities, lots of films displaying his work and an area showing how they create the iconic handbags. At the end there was a pop up shop as well. So much fun!Definitely recommend.",Chantelle R

50,Lovely shopping Dr,"Rodeo Drive in my opinion is the best shopping street not only in Beverly Hills but in the world. Ultra-luxe shops such as Tiffany's, Bulgari, Harry Winston, Cartier, Chanel, Valentino, Roberto Cavalli, Dior, Prada and much more. If you bring your wife or family ... you definitely need to have clear credit card and/or cash!The Rodeo Drive is not only for shopping brands but also for walk around and enjoy seeing the fancy cars to taste the wealthy living.Many Hollywood movies have been filmed in this drive.As a tourist, I personally don’t recommend that you start your adventure in LA at the Rodeo Dr, makes it the last stop otherwise you’ll be broke!",Abdullah A

My expectation was met, this is really a lovely place to shop and yes you do need quite a bit of money. However you can be like me and window shop or go into the shops and browse. Everybody does it and nobody minds. There are a lot of tourists however it wasn’t overcrowded.I particularly like the side street where the Versace shop was it was beautiful with hanging flowers and cobblestones.If you are in Los Angeles for the first time, do yourself a favour and go and have a look at how the other half shops.",ParisMatch
50,Boy Howdy !,"Every time I see or hear the name Beverly Hills I am reminded of the classic TV series with Jed, Ellie-May, Jethro and Granny. My wife and I wandered up and down Rodeo Drive during a LA in a Day Tour recently and I drove her crazy humming the tune.It was hilarious to watch all of the tourists peering into the storefront windows frequented by the smelly and unwashed, sorry I meant to say rich and famous. Then I realised we were such tourists and I had to slap myself. Our tour guide even mentioned a few of the establishments take a deposit before allowing people in the door.Sadly we didn’t see anything approaching a ceelebritee during our visit. But we did spend some time people watching and I was certainly drooling at some of the fine vehicular activity of the Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche type.Really interesting place to visit but we couldn’t afford to live there !",prw05
30,Didn't see anyone,It's a typical shopping Street with all the high-end designers another grossly expensive Outlets. If nothing fantastic but it is clean. I guess if you're into spending way too much for stuff you don't need it's a great place. I guess if you like to see celebrities spending your money then it will be a good place to go. I haven't seen any during the times I've been there.,Old Pro

Get ready to deal with possible disappointment when your kids do not actually see any stars hanging out on the drive.,Jm1l771

50,Beautiful,"The portion you want to walk is where the upscale boutiques are located. This is only 3 blocks starting at the Wilshire hotel (where some of Pretty Woman was filmed). From there walk the 3 blocks up and down. We really enjoyed it. Park in the neighborhoods a block or so from Rodeo Dr. Limit will be 2 hours, plenty of time.",J P
20,Very disappointing,"Forget all the glamorous images you've seen on television. It's your average high end shopping street. .Of course all the big brands are there, the the boutiques are nothing special compared to London, Paris, Amsterdam or Geneva.",Eric D

30,A street with 3.2km distance,"is a two-mile-long (3.2 km) street, primarily in Beverly Hills, California, with its southern segment in the City of Los Angeles.The name is most commonly used metonymically to refer to the three-block stretch of the street north of Wilshire Boulevard and south of Little Santa Monica Boulevard, which is known for its luxury goods stores.",Duo Backpackers
30,⭐,"Pretty and clean but small,not at all what you would think when you've seen it a million times in movies and what not. Ten minutes are well enough to do the length of the drive and you can't go to Beverly Hill and NOT see it!",happyinparistimestwo
40,For The Rich And Famous?!,"The short stretch of the famous and iconic Rodeo Drive houses some of the most high-end boutiques in the world, and tourists flock here – not to shop – but in the hopes of getting a glimpse or maybe even a selfie with a Hollywood celebrity! We did get to meet Robin Williams the last time we were here, but we weren’t so lucky this time around! In any case, I believe the celebrities mostly avoid this place now, because of so many selfie-hunters! Parking is not much of a problem, in one of the side streets! The surrounding streets have lots and lots of high-end eating options. Public restrooms are available in the basement near the Rodeo Drive Steps. The place is worth one short visit, even if you don’t get to meet any celebrities!",ShoaibShawoo

40,QUICK STOP,"Live the lifestyle of the rich and famous with a quick walk down famous Rodeo Drive. This three-block strip is lined with many of the world's premium brands but you really come here for the experience and to people watch.

50,Windows shopping and more,"Well, Rodeo Drive’s reputation proceeds the area. It is one of the most popular street in the whole US for expensive and glamorous brands! Even if you don’t intend to buy anything (which might be logical considering the prices), you will hear many locals saying that it worth visiting the street for windows shopping!

50,Must visit,If you are in LA you must visit Rodeo drive. We went there after breakfast. In fact it was only a street over. All designers are there with their latest stuff.

50,"Don’t just drive by, park and walk around!","Easy public valet parking halfway down the street. Loved the valet hospitality, he greeted us and directed is immediately to restrooms and how to get to the street from the underground parking. Wonderful clean restrooms right at parking. We expected snooty attitude in the shops, but everyone was SO nice. If you make eye contact and smile, all the security everywhere greets you with a smile too. Don’t be intimidated! In Tiffany’s, we asked about some VERY expensive jewelry, and they couldn’t have been nicer, event though they probably knew we were just getting a thrill. Recommend lunch at 208, good food at a good price just at the end of the street near Tiffany’s and Bev. Wiltshire Hotel. Great people watching and friendly people everywhere.",MACVirginia

50,Shopping paradise! Bring walking shoes!,"Absolutely amazing for high end shoppers. Every designer fashion house you can imagine has a shop on the drive. If you’re into haute couture, this is the spot to be. One thing I will say is, if possible, get an Uber. Parking can be a real hassle in the area and the places where you can park are kinda expensive, as to be expected in BH. Bring some comfortable walking shoes as well for walking up and down the street.",Nathan Smith Jr

40,See how the posh shop,Essentially Rodeo Drive is wall to wall expensive shops with security guards at every entrance. It is impressive to see however I can assure you that my wallet stayed well and truly in the pocket. If anything it was great to say I've seen it and ticked it off the tourist list of things to see in LA.,Aussie_2012
50,Dinner on rodeo drive,"The most iconic Drive in Beverly Hills is rodeo Drive. You will see all kinds of designer shops including Chanel, Cartier, paratha, Tiffany, Louis Vuitton and every designer you can imagine.

30,Stuck Out Like a Sore Thumb,"We went, to see what the stars experience. We felt uncomfortable and weren’t that impressed. I guess we can say we have been there. We did walk in a few stores that we could afford, but people followed us around everywhere. We didn’t spend a ton of time here.",Ryan Becky J
30,Nice,"Went here through a tour bus so didn't have a lot of time. Walked up maybe 1 street and took pics outside, as there were guards outside many of the stores. Lots of stores were boutique style and only had very few items. It was pretty though.",Linda
40,Leisure Saturday lunch,"We went to Rodeo drive as a part of the trip to a family lunch at Spago. Therefore, it was just a leisure strolling through the street. However, it always a pleasure going this stretch since there is always a new excitement, new experience from the window displays from all the shops. It is really quite the extravaganza. If you have a spare time over the weekend, you should try to walk around, sip some coffee and enjoy the feast to your eyes.",wachi60
40,Just to say you have visited,Beautiful shops out of most peoples price range. Decided to leave credit card at home to resist temptation. Another on to do list checked off but no need to visit again,Ivess3
20,Brand shops,"I suppose if you’re shopping for branded items, you can get them all here, but it seems a pretty small and boring area where tourists outnumber shoppers 10 to 1. I didn’t see any homeless, so that was one unusual thing for the LA region. The park at the north end is good.",mrdom
40,"Ok but not my thing, can’t afford nothing lol","We made a stop here with the tour we were on. I can say I walked Rodeo Drive, but didn’t go in one store. If you do go in, they check your idea and bank account. It’s nuts.",Trish B
20,Zzzzzzzz,"Lots of high end (too expensive stores) with pretentious people milling about. if you dare make the mistake of entering a store looking like you can't afford to shop there (dressed casually), be prepared to be followed and pestered thought the store. I thought this was a Hollywood movie cliche until seeing it for myself. This area is okay to drive through and look around, but unless you have the big bucks I wouldn't spend a lot of time here.",Bill K
30,Interesting but very overrated,It's much smaller than you expect. There are not many restaurants. A few blocks over there are some very good restaurants.,Loretta Veronic... L

50,Famous Rodeo Drive!,"Los Angeles was our third stop in America! My husband and I was pushed for time, we only had two nights here and decided that a tour guide would be best to cover all the touristy sights in one go, including a drive down Rodeo Drive to snap some pretty photos. Well worth a walk down if you have the time!",Epicureandelite!

50,Real Hollywood feel,We visited this on Sunday evening. Most of the shops were closed. So getting parking was easy. We just walk around famous stores. Super atmosphere. Hot cars passing by.,dr.pragnesh Vachharajani
50,Go there - and enjoy,If in LA - go there.The street is not that long - on one side it will and with the Four seasons hotel (Pretty woman movie hotel) and on the other side when you croass the road on the right you will have famous Beverly Hills sigh that you can take pictures in front of.On Google maps there is a longer Rodeo Drive - just a for this part. Get uber to take you in front of the Four season or if Ou are by car park on the north side on the back of Bevery hills sign - there is place to park and then cross the road..:)Enter any of the stores and just enjoy. There is also some places where you cant take any picture probably due to the privacy - but that is not on main street.,Annabrajkovic

30,Totally overrated,"I was excited about coming here because the tv/movies make it look beautiful. Well when we arrived. Parking is limited and fills up quickly. Then to top things off. They close at 7pm. We only got to shop at LV and as usual. Reps where snooty and would not help my teen boys until I brought it to someone’s attention. The shops are equivalent to Highland Park in Dallas, TX. Well with the exception of rodeo having a few more higher name brand stores and three levels to shop per store. Highland Park offers free parking. Again it looks way better on TV than what it does in person. Go figure",Sylvia G

40,Money lives here for sure,"My family and I walked along this road mostly because it has been shown so much in movies. We had no intention of actually shopping given how pricey it is but it was very cool to see. Plus there are a lot of neat photo opportunities here as well. This is worth seeing if spending a lot of time in Hollywood, but not necessarily a must-do.",jesse.lodge

40,Riding down Rodeo in my Maserati sportscar,"Great place to people watch! Not a high end shopper myself, so mostly the social experiment to watch the Instagrammers capturing their selfies. Must admit, posted one myself, so who am I to judge! (But honestly that yellow 'one of one' Rolls Royce parked in front of House of Bijan....very nice). Lots of hi end cars and impeccable shops and streets. Just casually strolled by Lisa Vanderpump shopping...what!? All in all, enjoyable couple of hours stroll.",kweenbee7

40,Lots of Fashion and Scenery,"Candidly, your experience here is going to be based on your expectations and love of fashion/shopping opulence. Rodeo is a long street (though not THAT long, quite shorter than say Fifth Avenue in Manhattan or The Miracle Mile in Chicago) studded with high priced, high quality clothing and accessories. All the big names are there, including a Tiffany’s, better known as a New York icon. The strolling and shopping crowd is quite diverse with everything from gawking tourists to “the rich and famous”. You’ll see numerous luxury cars and limousines including Rolls, Bentley, Lamborghini and Porsche. I found the “engine revving” by some sports car drivers particularly annoying, but that’s just part of the gig. Most of the sales personnel are quite polite and patient, knowing that many “shoppers” (i.e., tourists) simply cannot afford many of the items on display. My dear wife loves fashion, so she thoroughly enjoyed our time there and she was able to purchase a really nice silk scarf from Hermès. There are several bars and restaurants but as you might expect, they are quite pricey. Note that parking is a nightmare but there are secure public valet garages operated by the City of Beverly Hills. The rates are actually quite reasonable for such a popular high end neighborhood.",Jay B
50,A must,If you go to Beverley Hills then you must go to Rodeo Drive! Lots of side street parking and many public garages. A great walk with a lot of high end shopping. Get your wallet ready lol!,Kat562

And even if one can’t afford to buy it, that’s okay and you can do window shopping and if lucky you might catch a glimpse of your favourite movie or TV star.Also we found that 90% of the shoppers were window shoppers, so don’t feel awkward.",thefastfurious

30,No longer a major attraction,"Many years ago Rodeo drive used to be the center of attraction in Beverly Hills. No loner is the case, since many centers, similar to Rodeo Drive, opened up in many places in the country and all over the world - same fancy shops everywhere. if you want to see the rich and famous shopping, you more likely will be disappointed. All you see is anxious tourists from all over the world, looking for the stars, taking lots of photos, with brand name shops in the background.",NiliK
50,Must see!,I don’t think a visit to LA is complete without seeing the iconic rodeo drive. It oozes luxury and is close to the Beverly Hills information Center. Whether you want to shop or simply snap a picture of the most beautifully even and aligned palm trees it’s a must visit.,chocobon
30,Rodeo Drive,"Neat to say I've walked Rodeo Dr but other than that, not worth the time. High end shops, no food or drink really. Great place to people watch and see expensive cars but that's about it.",Llmhhg

40,You need to shop here at least once!,"It is really nice to see and feel quality. However, it comes with a price! I had the delightful experience in the '80s of being turned away....I'm sure I was profiled as not the demographics that could buy their stuff. In 2018 when I could buy anything in the stores, they were decidedly more accommodating!! Nevertheless, you should experience the ""Drive"" once at least!",Lori931
50,You HAVE to Go!,"Walking down Rodeo Drive is a fun experience. You'll see tons of cars that cost at least a quarter mil, window shop endlessly, and get in a few photos while you're at it. I think the best thing about being here is that no matter how much money you have or don't have, you will not feel out of place because everyone is there to sightsee. People are really friendly along this stretch and if you're social, you're sure to meet a new friend or two!",CheekyGold

If you are among the 1% you aren’t reading this review and if you aren’t, there are many other better places to spend your time, and money, in LA. I recommend skipping Rodeo Drive and finding those.",albertasn0wbird

Restaurants to suit all purses. Was amazed to see the crowds on the street on XMAS day and only if the shops were open - The Guess store must have done a roaring trade on the day as it was the only store open.

10,Great place to go if you want to be looked down upon by a bunch of posers,"Not a big dealLots of posers and “wanna be” rich people trying to impress each other.It’s amazing walking into the boutiques and being looked down upon by $15 an hour wage earners.Nothing really to see or do here, absolutely would never recommend anyone visit unless they have a large ego to stroke.",oldtiredandretired
40,Fun to visit,"Come to Rodeo Drive, and go for a walk. It's a place where some of the rich locals like to come be seen. The storefronts are fun to look at, and there are always some high-priced cars parallel parked along the road. But, beware of the fake ""richness."" I come to Rodeo Drive every time in the the area, and the same Rolls Royce is staged on the roadside.",Scott

40,Iconic,So you have to go to Rodeo Drive if you're in LA right?! The place is iconic! Didn't see any celebs and we got treated like we couldn't afford to be there by several shop assistants but we enjoyed having a wander around. The area is nice and clean and great for people watching! Highlight was seeing the Bijan Rolls Royce and skulking outside the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.,catp79

10,Rodeo Drive Cosmetics,"Rodeo Drive is a wonderful place to visit. The shopping, restaurants and people watching is just the best! Please save yourself some grief though and DO NOT go into Rodeo Drive cosmetics. They will try really hard to draw you in with free samples and free facials. Then they will ask for your credit card number to run through a transaction while you have a masque on. they even asked for my pin number which thankfully id did not give them. Then they ran through a transaction for 17,000.00 rather than 1700.00. fortunately visa declined the 1,700. I cannot believe that they are able to prey on tourists like this.",Mira M

30,High end shopping,"If you have the funds to shop here, do it. Very nice stores and the area feels special for shoppers with $$$. For your average Joe, like me, it's just sort of weird and boring.",Schisti
50,CAR SHOW,Forget the shopping and your Pretty Woman moment - this is a phenomenal place to gawk at incredible cars. You can let your mind wander about who really owns them and you may even see some super star rapper taking their Lamborghini or Maybach or IROC out for a spin. But it’s a blast to see the cars parading up and down the street. And the other sights cruising the street aren’t bad either.,iCritic
50,The Iconic Rodeo Drive,It is a very nice place to visit in LA. Beside seeing where Pretty Woman was filmed you can also enjoy a nice walk and the shops.,Pedro F
40,Celebrity drive,Rodeo drive in Beverly hills is famous road which has many celebrities living in the vicinity. This is covered by many tours if you are interested to know more about them.,travelforfun75
30,A good place to watch people watching people,"If you want to see Lamborghinis by the dozen, an electric yellow Rolls Royce or the spot where Paul Manifort bought his ostritch jackets ... or if you just like watching people watching other people, this is the place for you.If you get a little hungry, the nearby Cheesecake Factory offers a great menu, huge portions and very fair pricing. Give it a try!",T0mmyBahama
50,Not just for Pretty Women,"Rodeo drive is not the snooty place it used to be! They have the high end stores , everything you could be looking for. You’re treated like a real “ customer” unlike some other stores that are high end, I felt as though I was an actual buyer and not a looker.",Sandy W
50,High end shops with nice and clean atmosphere,"Worldwide famous location all seen in films and on television. Don’t expect see celebrities here LOL. Unlike many parts of Los Angeles which are dirty, untidy, smelly, this area is very clean and well maintained. There are predominantly exclusive high end shops plus large public gardens close by where you can relax.",DCu
40,Rodeo Drive through the eyes of a shopper,"Chose a cool but sunny January afternoon to take a walk down the famed Rodeo Drive and came away with a few thoughts.It is much easier to visit all the high end boutique stores here than Fifth Avenue. They are so bunched together you could easily walk pass a few without even knowing it. You don't need walking shoes here.Like visiting the old Gucci boutique in Rome forty years ago, the tight, dimly lit and extremely unattractive Goyard store still requires you to wait outside on the sidewalk so they can ""control"" the number of visitors in the facility. If I was about to spend $1200 on a men's wallet or $3500 for a shopping tote, I think I would be insulted.The store What Goes Around Comes Around which sells previously owned high priced handbags such as Hermes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton located just off Rodeo is an interesting place to stop by as it is like a small museum where you not only see handbags your mother or grandmother used but also clothes and a wide array of accessories. Prices - don't ask. Parking is fairly easy on a weekday. I parked at Barney's a block away for $18 for the day. Not terrible considered I paid $32 to park at the ""free"" Griffith Observatory...",Keith T
40,Very expensive stores,"It is basically a beautiful and well maintained street with extremely expensive and high end luxury stores. Because I am very far from that social level I felt myself a bit lost there (LOL). If you like movies, several filming locations of the movie “Pretty Woman - Julia Roberts” were on the Rodeo Drive. There is also a nice Cheesecake Factory restaurant very close to the Rodeo Dr. one can stop to grab a meal. I still recommend a visit to the Rodeo Dr. but if I was to skip a major attraction in LA area this would be the one (major attractions: Hollywood, Griffith observatory, Santa Monica Pier and Beach, Venice Beach, Malibu).",Minardi
30,Have to visit once,"If you visit LA, you have to visit Rodeo Dve, take some pictures of the street and the iconic Beverly Wilshire.Vibe can be a little pretentious but soak up the experience and then leave.Staff at the numerous shops were surprisingly very friendly.",Mummonemo
40,Lovely but not really for most shoppers,"Rodeo Drive and th streets surrounding are neat, clean and attractive. But unless you are very rich it's not really a shopping destination. Beverly Hills is more of a tourist destination than a shopping one. The streets are full of bus loads of tourists not buying anything at these high end shops where the cheapest handbags start at $500. Don't expect to see celebrities either but it's very well kept and interesting to walk around.",Anya L
30,You fell the time has passed,Rodeo was always a great location for the luxury and the shopping but you really fell now that the time has passed. Less traffic some empty stores but this is the situation of many retail destination,Super Shuttle
30,"High end shops, high prices, nice area.","Yes they have the high end shops, but honestly you can find most of them in any big city with probably better prices. The area was nice and it was interesting to walk the streets and do a little bit of shopping but for me it was more of a I have been there once, no reason to go back kind of deal.",Speedracer61
40,If you’re in Beverly Hills it’s a must see,"So you’re traveling and you’re in Beverly Hills, you see it on TMZ so you might as well stop by, rodeo drive is an influx of over-the-top retailers and quite honestly a bunch of pretentious people, if you’re a car guy you’re bound to see a super car or two and if you hang out for a full day you’re probably bound to see at least a B list celebrity, I prefer to walk the loop of Canon,Beverly and Rodeo, If you’re going to go, it’s probably preferable that you dress the part so homeless casual is totally acceptable. Parking can be an issue but there is a parking structure on both Canon and Beverly Bringing camera there’s always something to see, rodeo drive is pretty damn amazing around Christmas time with all the lights, I would have to say it’s probably a must see.",Matt B
50,Drive at Beverly Hills,We drove at Beverly Hills Area including others.Viewed the Awesome Homes of various sizes!Even the Trees were awesome.You can stop along some roads to take pictures and view the fantastic homes.Driving with a Rental Car is much better.

40,The place to go if your a car freak,"Pleasant place to walk, stores and merchandise that is beyond the reach of most mortal humans, but it's fun to look I suppose. BUT if you want to see almost every type of exotic automobile 10 - 20 minutes in this area should do the trick",LSRealty

40,Fun to act fancy for a day!,"Our tour stopped here, and it's definitely a must see. There is a store that is the most expensive men's store in the world, and other pricey places. If you walk a few blocks you can also get a picture with the famous Beverly Hills sign!",Danielle
50,Fabulous,"You can enjoy this area as a spectator sport, the people watching is fascinating!The area certainly lives up to its reputation.Bring a big wallet or purse though, if you are from Europe the displayed prices are exact the same but in the U.S. it is plus taxes, service charge and anything else they can think of. This makes the final price expensive and unattractive.",Bigboy1959
40,Walked around,"We walked around Rodeo Dr for about an hour. Cool to see all the fashion stores. Some have writing on their doors for by appointment only, the kind of places you see in the movies. Very clean streets. Real chances of seeing a celebrity are slim. Go check it out.",Bryan
20,Outdoor shopping mall,"For all of the legend and aura surrounding ""Rodeo Drive"", unfortunately today it is not much more than an outdoor shopping mall. While I'm admittedly not much of a ""shopper"" and don't know much about individual establishments, I was expecting to see a host of unique, high-end retail establishments. Instead, I saw a host of mid-level national shopping chains present, with the occasional ""unique"" storefront thrown in for good measure. Definitely not what I was expecting, and for me, it wasn't worth much more than a drive through the area.",Matt S
40,"Crowded, Bougie and a Must See","My favorite place to shop is Walmart, so keep that in mind while reading this review.We loved our afternoon shopping on Rodeo Drive. It’s overpriced, trendy and crowded with tourists. It’s also where Hollywood celebrities shop, so it’s great for “star gazing.”For example, we stopped in Armani, so my wife could try on shoes. I got bored and struck up a conversation with a woman shopping with her daughter. The daughter turned out to be an actor with multiple film and TV credits. The woman’s husband was an Oscar winning producer! They were wonderfully friendly people. And they helped pass the time, while my wife tried on $1200 shoes!At many shops, we were offered champagne, beer or cappuccino while we are shopping. Smart move retailers. Three beers into Tory Birch and out came my credit card!Prices are staggering and almost fun to look at, if you are not buying. In Chanel, I looked at a cutsie funky dress. Not a gown, a summery dress to go clubbing in. The price was $25,800.00! I took a picture to show you (blue and white striped dress).Remember, I’m a Walmart guy. I don’t like shopping, but still had a fun afternoon on Rodeo Drive.",TVDad
40,Limited parking,"Ended up only driving down the main area because parking is so limited. Teenagers got kick out of seeing the shops, cars, people watching. Appeared to have a couple shops that are not as high end as I remember from years ago, but still lots of luxury.",Liz & fam
40,The show,"Great shopping street on a par with London, Paris, Rome, NY. Store windows are fabulous, people watching is incredible (both good and bad.) The downside is the parking which is inadequate and congestion which is outright rude. Excellent dining opportunities nearby. We’ll come here but prefer to be dropped off.",Mike K
30,Amazing opulent street,No parking available. It's an interesting drive to see how the rich and famous shop. It really wasn't worth stopping though. It's probably a mile long and it's done,Gissocrates3

50,Not my first Rodeo.....,"If you've got the money honey......it's the best place in B.H. I make sure when I am in the area I go to cruise the 'Rodeo"". I mostly window shop because the prices are not for the faint hearted but I manage to buy a couple of things. If you can't afford what you want, take a PHOTO and I believe you will be able to create the same 'look' in Farmers Market not the label but the style. I have never been to Rodeo Drive without seeing a celebrity. The area has heaps of cafes and restaurants and a terrific deli not far from Reeves. Treat yourself.... look at the opulence, the style and eat the food.... everything is first class!",Janice86
40,Just had to do it!,When visiting L.A you have to do Rodeo Drive! Lovely and so clean compared to Hollywood which I found dirty and disappointing. Parking was easy at $2 an hour. Had a look around but too scared to go in to many of the shops. It is clearly for the elite and the 'greeters' clearly know the people they direct their attention too which is a shame as I was treating myself to a new purse. Still lovely to visit and see. Lovey area Beverly Hills.,m4slcsam
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"Rodeo Drive is a great street to celebrity watch, take photos, gaze at the window displays that are Oscar worthy and relax.It's a three block stretch of stores that are world famous.Did you know that Rodeo Drive goes well beyond that and is mostly residential?A must-see destination when visiting Los Angeles.Of course, Beverly Hills is much more than Rodeo Drive.Take a tour or pick up a map at the visitors center nearby.You will have fun.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill

50,Over the top,A great place to stroll through wether one is buying or not. All the high end well-known brands are representing in stores in this street.

Yes it has all the designer shops and nice feel to the place and definitely worth a walk down. The Beverley Hills Wiltshire at the one end is imposing, and some of the other buildings. places off here to stop and eat and drink nothing on the main road really. Lots of fancy cars too including the yellow rolls royce with its own yellow parking meter.

It is perfectly manicured and very clean and tidy.Fascinating to see a shop with very little in it, but everything costs a pretty penny.Didn't see Pretty Woman or the shop she went into but at the bottom of the drive is the Wiltshire Hotel also made famous by pretty woman.

40,"Pretty Street, Fancy Shops..","My friends and I visited Beverly Hills during or LA holiday. We stayed the Hotel Beverly Terrace which was about a 25 min walk through lovely residential streets. Rodeo drive was pretty nice and it was surreal to visit in person a place we’ve seen many times in movies/ Tv etc. It was all very pretty and well maintained but we didn’t find it that interesting, more of a tick off the ‘to do list’. The shops were all high end as we’d imagined but we didn’t feel comfortable to even pop in to any! Still a lovely place to visit though for us Sydney Siders!",Stacey13588

40,Must do.,Another must do in California - take your credit card. My only advice is bare in mind some of the shops require you to ring for them to open the doors they are not automatically open to all I guess as a security measure.,Michael D
50,"Shopping on Rodeo in Beverly Hills, Calif",This is the way to go to shop for designer apparel. Most of the designer boutiques are right there together so you can walk from store to store and get everything you need and want. Beautiful area to walk. Stores are well stocked and so you can usually find your size. It is the rule not the exception to have your car valet parked and in this area there is no shortage of Bentleys on the streets. There are good restaurants in this area as well. Very safe area and a great experience,kveh16

We didn't actually go into any of the stores, I'm sure they are well out of my price range for shopping. We did walk around the neighborhood doing some window shopping and checking out all the high-priced vehicles in the area. We saw Lamborghinis, Ferraris, rolls-royces, and Teslas.

50,RODEO DRIVE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT,"Rodeo Drive is one of the costliest areas of Los Angeles and t is meant for shopping areas for the film stars. There are many high value shops and you need to have prior appointment to enter some of the shops. That’s why I always had a dream to see this area.Since we stayed in the Hollywood area, we took Bus 217 first and from Santa Monica/Fairfax stop, we took Bus 780 and got down at Santa Monica/Camden. Rodeo drive was only 2 mins from there and started walking along the drive. There was beautiful lighting on both sides of the drive and one after another designer shops, which took our attractions while looking the glass show cases. At one end, we found the luxurious hotel Beverly Wilshire.The best thing I liked about Rodeo drive was the plenty of colourful chairs and table arrangement at every 50ft or so along both the sides of the roads. We sat in many spots and enjoyed the Rodeo drive.At the end after 500m wlak or so, we found a nice staircase which was a nice spot for taking photos.Overall, we enjoyed the place very much.",DPMALLIC

40,Unique window shopping,"No visit to L.A and Beverly Hills would be complete without a stroll down Rodeo Drive. We had been here years before (when we did actually see a famous screen actress) but brought the family this time. Nothing has really changed, the expected ultra expensive brand boutiques, no price tags in the window displays (if you need to ask the price you cannot afford it..), staffed by impossibly elegant assistants standing around waiting for some custom. We found it all a bit soulless but it has to be experienced. Our grandson was more impressed by the number of exotic vehicles which seem drawn to the palm shaded carriageway, probably owned by those who can afford to shop here.Underground parking one block away not expensive for a one hour stay, which is quite long enough to see everything (unless you are buying..).",tripeagle

Super clean and well decorated street, with flowers around, and amazing designers stores of course! If you love fashion, for sure you will get crazy here! I personally did not buy anything as I am European so it would be cheaper for me doing it in Europe rather than here. A must visit street for sure!",Jazzlove15

30,Great shopping eye candy but beware Rodeo Cosmetics touts,A great way to spend an hour or so checking out some amazing shops. I sat outside the Beverley Wilshire Hotel (Pretty Woman hotel) and had lunch; the food and service was excellent and the people watching was fun. Something I didn’t expect was the touts at Rodeo Cosmetics. They are scammers; just google them and you’ll find the complaints.,Alisono979

20,Just a row of fancy shops,Didn’t really see the point of this. Takes ten minutes to walk the two blocks with lots of designer shops that you can’t buy anything in (and largely wouldn’t want to). Less pleasant ambience than New Bond Street in London or equivalent places in Hong Kong. All a bit tacky conspicuous consumption. But I guess it’s part of the LA experience. Best to just drive through on a bus tour. Even my teenage daughters who are into this stuff were underwhelmed.,TomGSt_Albans
30,Just a street with shops,We went down the street as part of a tour. The tour guide said that he hardly ever sees anyone shopping here (no one has shopping bags in hand). It’s just a place people like to walk and it mostly has stores that are in shopping malls across the US.,Kris91
50,Quick stroll,We arrived early before the shops opening just to go for a wander. Lovely and quiet and very clean. Kids loved looking in the windows and the humming birds around the hanging baskets were lovely.Glad we visited but only stayed 20 mins but had to be done,Rachel P

50,Touristy yet a classic!,"Nice area around the actual street and while the main drag has very expensive stores you can still actually find normalstuff in the area. An experience to walk around and look at the expensive cars, people watch and enjoy the views of the mountains. More tourists than locals but still worth going too. Plenty of small parking garages and at 2 Rodeo it was 2 hours valet parking for free. Not bad on a Sunday! Max was 17 bucks and most others were about the same. Will you see a celebrity? Unlikely but who knows. Long enough out there and who knows. :)",Josh79b

If not, skip it OR just go, walk around, take a few pictures and now you can say that you’ve been to famous Rodeo Drive. That’s what we did. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed the view for a little bit without costing us a dime. But if shopping at expensive stores is not your thing just skip it!",Joselyn C

50,The Most Fashionable Street in the Americas!!,"Via Rodeo ( pronounced Vee Ah Row-Die-O ) is the most fashionable street in the Americas and can be compared to Champs Elysee's in Paris. The images of Beverly Hill's Lamborghini's, Rolls Royce and every fancy car would be here in this 3 block ribbon of style with all designer shops. You can park either behind Beverly Hills Park ( free ) or in the covered parking lot next to wholefood and walk down the street. They have recently opened a multi-mirrored maze photo stop next to the cobbled walkway. It is safe, fancy and pretentious with the flagship shops of most brands. If you like shopping, one block east to Beverly Drive has the budget friendly boutiques, local shops and awesome restaurants, where the locals go. It is a must see tourist attraction and no trip in LA is complete without a visit to Via Rodeo !!!",paulrupesh
30,A shopping hub,This drive is dedicated for shoppers.The street is full of fashion shops.Most of the luxury and upmarket brands are on showcase there.It is in the open air offering a great experience of shopping unlike the close malls,drjsaleh

50,A must to visit place.,"I visited this street twice. One was on the afternoon and the other was at night.This drive should be on top of your list. Great vibes come out of this place, the architecture is just magnificent. It has high end brands.A lot of restaurants to dine at. Many cafes to go to.You should check it yourself.",Abdulah1996
50,You must walk this street,"We were traveling with kids to LA and stopped at Rodeo Drive. The street is beautiful, I mean the walk ways, lightning, every detail is taken care of. All designers have a store and service is way too good! Hyper-personalized. So weather you want to get a pricy shoe or any clothes, I recommend you do it here! Maybe you might find a Hollywood Star. Also the cars that drive through here are spectacular.",Manuel P
30,Get your free parking at Crate and Barrel!,"This is a must-do just to check it off a list. We parked at Crate and Barrel, which offers free 2-hour parking (no purchase/validation required). We then did the walk to the nearby park then down Rodeo Drive. It’s neat to see the iconic shops, but that’s about it. It would have been nice to have people offering us champagne on the sidewalk or something like that, but we can now say, “Been there, done that.”",angelafab
30,I feel poor,"It’s interesting to see just to check it off your list but let’s be honest- you aren’t buying anything here. I would go as far as to say those that can afford the $12,000 T-shirt aren’t reading Trip Advisor looking for deals, reviews and suggestions. Parking was reasonable to secure and it’s not as crowded as other places in Cali we visited. It’s really a hour walk around, check out some shops, watch fancy cars drive up and maybe get brave to walk in to 1 or 2 of the shops. You may get more as a drive by unless you plan on truly shopping but are those $1000 sale rack items really a bargain? Come on- fabric is fabric once you remove a name.",stinkykitty
40,How the other half lives!,Fun place to see. Amazing storefronts and luxury cars parked on the streets. Good restaurants and places to grab coffee or a drink. Good people watching.,Jenny R
20,A Disappointment for Tourists,"Your only thrill is that the street is so well-known for high-end shopping. The architecture is plain, there isn’t much greenery, and the sidewalks bake in the sun all day.Passing several times over a one-week period, we never saw anyone famous.",MannyG2000
50,Very Nice Shopping District,Great place to shop if you are into designer wear. It's easy to get to and very clean. You will see a lot of fancy cars on Rodeo drive. Even if you can't afford to buy anything just go for the experience.,ROCHELLE J
30,Interesting,"This is a great place for people watching. You can see spoiled little rich kids spending $750 for a black hoodie with a brand name on it. I looked for something small I could buy from Gucci just to say I did, but the cheapest thing was a $200 plastic key chain. No, thank you. It's fun to go once for the experience, but don't budget more than a hour for the whole experience.",Krystie P
30,Nice shopping street but too expensive,"It's easy to get to and park by Rodeo Drive, one of the world's most famous shopping streets. And wow is that a great place. With palm trees, nice and clean, and expensive shops with well-known brands. But maybe it's a little too expensive? The shops are empty and within the nicely ornate showcases all the correct dressed retailers are waiting and waiting.... For although it's crowding out of life, of all the turrists just there to see, nobody walks into the shops' doors. And those who really can afford to shop there - they have their own entrance at the back and may require the store to close during their visit.",Trine Lise K
40,Good to see,Visited here couple of days ago. Great to see the shops and the famous Rodeo. Shops are pretty much empty as they’re so expensive! Worth taking a look and dreaming about what you could buy if you won the lottery!,Judith B
30,Iconic but Nothing Special,"Visited on a sunny, warm August day. As expected, Rodeo Drive was bustling but we easily found parking in a garage by Brighton.That said, coming from New Jersey,this just felt like an outdoor version of the Short Hills Mall, which is not too far a drive from home for us.So, for some people, I can see that this is unique and fun. But for us, it just wasn’t that special so we only spent 20 minutes looking around.",ZonaP
50,Car lovers dream,"Hang with the Uber wealthy. Laid back atmosphere despite the massive display of wealth. The cars in the neighborhood are insane... Rolls-Royce are like Camrys. Stores themselves can be intimidating but area is very nice, very safe and fun to hang. Good restaurants. Go to urth cafee!!! About a 5-7 minute walk on Beverly drive.",Jim E
40,Chic chic and chic!,"If you want to feel a star shopping in the luxury shops street then this is the place to be. Can’t miss the nice shops. Yet not really a walking one, will mostly need your chauffeur to drop you from shop to shop.",NabilBKK
40,Well known location,"We have probably all seen this location in films and on television thus it is popular with sight-seeing tourists. Unlike many parts of Los Angeles which are dirty, untidy, smelly and uninviting [especially in and around Hollywood Boulevard] this area is very clean and well maintained. There are predominantly exclusive shops plus large public gardens close by where you can relax.",Betula103
30,people watching & window shopping,It is great to do some window shopping and people watching you may even see a celebrity or two. Go to the near by park for shade grab lunch on the cheap like fatburger.,rsenteno
40,Very well kept,"Extremely well kept area compared to most of LA that I’ve seen so far. All the exclusive shops and some very expensive places to have coffee or indeed eat. People watch and you may spot someone famous. Good if you like expensive cars as well. Not really made for crossing the street! Takes forever! Needed to use a restroom so used the Wilshire, Beverly Hills! Designer shops are not really my thing if truth be told.",AnselmColom
50,Just like the movies!,"We felt like movie stars just walking down Rodeo Drive! We had just left the nasty swamp lands of HollyWood Blvd, so Rodeo drive was a breath of fresh air! It was so clean. Nice fresh air! No stink of trash or homeless, or dog poop anywhere. It was perfect. The stores are amazing! There is also a park across the street with tons of shade trees that we really enjoyed hanging out and just soaking up the California sun! My teenager loved the shopping. My 5 yr old loved the big trees in the park area. We ate at “Fat Burger” which I would also recommend. Pretty sure we saw a famous NBA star but since I don’t pay attention to sports I couldn’t think of his name. Go to Rodeo drive! There is also a beautiful pink heart mural thats a must for pictures.",Brandi M
40,Very pretty,"Pretty for photos but definitely a touristy area. Very hard to get into area and hard to find parking. Once there, my friend got swindled by a face cream store who stands outside and says your eyes look bad, then pulls you downstairs and tries to sell you $1500 in face cream. Then takes price down to $600. Then stamps final sale, which is a lie, because we went back and returned and they wanted us to stay quiet because other people were in store being swindled.I think these kinds of people should stay at the mall.",Desiree
40,Window shopping only,What a lovely way to spend a morning. Definitely a window shopping activity unless you have 8 figures in your bank account. Most of the shopkeepers are very pleasant with people just looking and there are definitely many one of a kind things to see. Only rude person was the woman who was in a jewellery shop and could not be bothered with us. When I win lotto I will not be getting my diamonds from her. A must do when in LA,Elfriede M
50,Must-see in LA,"Even if you don’t buy anything,it’s fun to see the lap of luxury that is Rodeo Drive! Nice walks around Beverly Hills nearby too!",Macawley B

40,Must Visit,"If ever your in Los Angles Rodeo Drive is a must visit.It's very plush, very clean and very expensive.",Steve57C
40,Had to go to Rodeo Drive while in LA,"I think this is something you have to do when visiting LA just to say you have been there done that! Honestly though there really isn’t much to it and is overrated (LA is overall overrated) but it was interesting going there and getting some good photos. You won’t meet any celebrities there as they don’t shop there, they go elsewhere lolThere is a photo booth to get selfies etc",Vikkir69
40,Passed by,One thing one has to do when in LA is to just see and feel the Rodeo Drive feeling :) We had a cab for the weekend - a perfect way of cruising here..,Gabbe
20,Overhyped,"Everyone always talks about Rodeo Dr, so I was like Okay, let me check this out. If you're a normal person who doesnt get all fascinated by overpriced boutiques/stores just pass this up, it wont appeal to you.Maybe im too cynical and poor to appreciate it. but thats my thoughts.",imrico
50,A must visit !,"An amazing street to walk and see, beautiful. Shops are high end, celebrities are walking on the street.",Yolyni
40,Must see in la,"Was kind of hiped to see the Rodeo drive. You get what you expect: lots of expensive shops, Ferraris /lamborghinis /... Driving around, beautiful rich people",Kalw F
50,What a street!!,"My two teenage daughters and I loved walking down Rodeo Drive. The California weather was perfect for strolling and taking in the sites. There are lots of very high end expensive stores, but it was fun to just walk in and check them out. It was walking distance to Saks Fifth Avenue and a close Uber ride to a fabulous outdoor mall. The huge Beverly Hills sign is also very close to take a good family photo!!!",shaydel4kids
30,Rich,Step into the shoes of pretty woman - feel like rich when you stroll all the fancy stores - get your pic with a limousine,dennys34
30,I’m bored... 😶,"From Hollywood I see homeless and poor begging for cash on the street, which made me real sad to see, not a shoe on their feet then literally a stone throw away I’m looking at pretentious people walking around all wanting to be celebrities. Chasing the “Dream”! Rude, arrogant human beings everywhere, competition city, people full of road rage, no patience for anyone crossing the road, looking at people in competition ‘who’s car is gonna go first when the traffic light turns green’. Nothing in LA blew me away if anything it made me appreciate back home, and how normal life is. Rodeo is crazy but it sure was great to people watch and have coffee watching the hustling and bustling and the crazies all around 😎",Ceallachain ☘️
30,Underwhelmed,Decided to take a cruise down the street...never realized it was not very long and was in all underwhelmed. It was a neat experience but didn't live up to expectations.,Adam
10,Too expensive,We walked Rodeo Drive in the evening - everything is closed - and the morning - everything is closed.,Hotziek60s
40,Cool to cruise the street,Fun to have seen it. Can’t really afford shopping here. Wasn’t looking for anything special either. Really fancy shops with expensive shopping.,Jimmy S
50,Drove down Rodeo Drive,"Neat experience to drive down Rodeo Drive to see all the high end stores. Also, my kids loved pointing out all the high end cars we saw. Pretty cool thing to do in Beverly Hills.",Porterhub
40,Girls Day in Paradise,"I spent a couple of hours alone so that I could shop on Rodeo Drive. There were so many great stores to shop at that I didn’t get to complete my shopping. Every luxury brand is represented so you will definitely find some expensive things; however, it truly is about the Pretty Woman experience. I was in paradise, even if I couldn’t buy everything I wanted!",Michelle G
50,A MUST FROM L.A.!,"Very, very nice for a walk, awesome flower pots with REAL flowers in blossom, very clean place, luxurious shops (not for current people obviously). Forget shopping and just enjoy the walk. At least you need to go there once. Anyway, to recommend!",medoc23
30,shopping... shopping.. shopping.,Good for a walk and a coffee unless you are planning to spend a lot of money in shopping. Some good places for a picture but thats it,Luis G
50,Quintessential LA,Can’t come to LA without a stop on Rodeo Dr. it was busy and hard to find parking at first but once we did we took in all the eye candy! Never saw a diagonal crosswalk before😮 The staff at every store was very friendly and attentive. Honestly I was surprised and expected it to be more “snooty” Thankful for a good experience.,Jazna5
50,People watching,Unless you have bottomless pockets most of the shops are beyond you but well worth a stroll down and unbeatable people watching,gsutherl
40,Gotta go at least once!,"Great place to go. I'm a car enthusiast, so it was really cool to walk down the street and see a new Rolls Royce, rare BMWs, and even limited production cars like the Lexus RC-F. This is a very clean section of town, it's nice to take a stroll and window shop.",Bamakayakangler
40,Iconic shopping,Great just to walk around and into shops. Contrary to image portrayed in Pretty Woman staff in even the most expensive stores were pleasant. Great to finish visit with a drive up the hill to check out the mansions.,Culinarykids

40,This is a Must Do but don’t think about buying anything,"Our Uber driver was great and knowledgeable, he gave us a quick rundown of what to do and pointed out points of interest, such as Pretty Woman and the hotel they stayed in. But I had all intentions to purchase a handbag, but all were out of my price range with the Louis Vuitton at $5000",LisaP4130
50,Jolly,Visited la for the day and thought we’d do some sightseeing so we went to rodeo drive. Wasn’t as busy as I thought it would be. We thought we’d do some celeb hunting and wasn’t disappointed we we spotted post malone just casually walking alone. So my mate grabbed a quick picture awesome guy (post) ha,Pack1984
50,Extraordinary Display of Wealth,"If you are into boutique shops that offer shoes for over $1,000, golf shirts for $350 and jewelry for millions of dollars, then Rodeo Drive is for you. I would call it a must see/do if you are in L.A. for more than a day. Sitting at a little table along the sidewalk waiting for my friends, I counted over 15 cars pass by that cost over $200,000, and that was in 20 minutes. It was a lot of fun for a middle class tourist to visualize such displays of personal wealth.",RJRogers61
50,Nice,It's a nice place to visit but if you're not willing to spend money there are not many activities there but sure it's worth to see the area and take some pictures and if you love luxurious cars you'll see a lot,Laura M
50,Where else are you gonna buy this stuff?,Unless you’re shopping online I don’t know where else I can check out these designers all at once. Also the st supery wine across from the goyard is phenomenal. I’m a member there now because I go there so often it actually saves money. Lol gotta love rodeo,Ryan B

50,Glad I got to experience it,I heard so many things about rodeo drive and decided since I was in LA I might as well go see. It’s nice and has very expensive stores and beautiful homes nearby. If you’re in the area I would recommend passing by.,TravelingCScott
50,Kid in a candy store,"So basically we went shopping g here as part of touring the city today.Went to Louis Vuitton and got the star treatment with champagne and the private terrace. As a lover of the brand this made the experience perfect and I left with 2 new gorgeous bags. The sales assistant was also amazing and was so attentive, which again enhanced my experience. Great day!",Meloney B

50,Great street,Nice to have a walk and look at the brands and stores .. definitely is expensive same as the parking.. nice to have breakfast and then a walk in the morning tgen u ve the rest of the day to do somthing else .,Yousra maklad
50,Dreaming,I didn’t actually go into any of the shops for the huge price tags that come along with these stores. Great place to watch expensive cars and expensive people come by. I wouldn’t waste too much time there though. Definitely worth a walk down the drive though.,MikeMc33
20,Walked Rodeo drive,"This to me looked like any high end street in any big city. Has the specialty shops like Cartier, LV, Gucci etc. We found it kind of hard to just find a spot for a glass of wine. We aren’t big shoppers either so there’s that! I’d skip it - I did like an off street Beverly Drive. Cute coffee shop and some local shops.",Peartogo
20,Depressing on So Many Levels,"First of all, you're not going to see stars shopping, or Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman with her arms filled with packages. As a matter of fact, what you will see is tourists. And more tourists. And empty stores filled with expensive merchandise, because this crowded shopping district is nothing more than a marketing opportunity for high end brands. Very few of the people on the street can afford any of the goods inside these ultra luxe emporiums. It's really like visiting a stage set, all the glitz is on the outside but there's nothing behind it. A sort of zoo for worshipping slick surfaces, displays of wealth, the idea of conspicuous consumption and the material rewards of ambition.The window displays are admirable & those with an interest in design and visual merchandising will be impressed. For that reason only; I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.",pookala
50,Fabulous,Just the storefronts themselves were beautiful whoever does the window dressings wow amazing. It was a lot of fun to just window shop,twin411

40,"Cars, Celebrities and Brands","If you are a fan of any of these 3 then Rodeo drive is a must go. You will certainly come across one your favorite car, a designer bag or a star. Shopping this time I found was more affordable as many stores had promotions. Please visit during the day as most of the stores close max by 7 pm. You will find some great eating joints and bars in side lanes.",SumitBanga
50,Beautiful experience,"Beautiful walk and amazing scenic scenery. Area is very clean and the stores are just amazing, Having the Beverly Wilshire at the end was an awesome finish to this tour.",nfarst
50,Beautiful,One of my most favorite scenes IN the usa.u enjoy the spirit of Beverly hills....beautiful people in an ambience based on creativity ....shops expensive... but siting on a cafe terrace and watching world including famous faces go by is stunning....,artsmart2018
50,Strolling With Friends,A definite MUST DO once you are in Los Angeles.It was such a beautiful picturesque sunny day strolling on THE RODEO DRIVE visiting the beautiful shops an experience to remember.It made me FALL IN LOVE WITH LA.,MARCIA R
30,Just high end shops,I don't know what I was excepting or hoping to see but it was just like any other shopping area but a little nicer with higher end shops. We didn't even see any good people or car watching. Took a few pictures to say I had been there and left.,sheljowo
50,Rode the two-storey street car,"Shopping, restaurants and fun. Check out the stars about on this strip of shopping galore, even if only Window Shopping. Plenty to see here!!! enjoy. A holiday MUST DO, FOR SURE!!!",Sarah R
50,Luxury Shopping,Rodeo Drive is one of the most known streets in the world. Located in the Golden Triangle in Beverly Hills a 3 block stretch of all the luxury brand stores. A must visit while in Los Angeles. The majority of the parking lots are two hours free before 6 PM. Don’t be afraid to walk into the boutiques even if you cannot afford to shop there.... disregard the sales people if they are snobby and remember... if they could have afforded to shop there they probably wouldn’t be a salesperson there.... 😂Make sure to visit 2 Rodeo shopping center in the corner of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire and make sure to eat at 208 Rodeo Restaurant which is one of my favorite spots located next door to Tiffany’s.,Skyruby
50,Great shopping,"If you like high end and only high end, it’s a great place to shop. Anything you could want on the luxury end is there. It can get crowded but don’t mind the crowds",Nathaniel T
40,Must see,"You must go visit Rodeo Drive if you’re in LA, just to have been there. The area is very nice, but if you don’t «fit in» a visit to the shops can be a little weird with rude staff.",Birgitte O
30,Great place to see fancy cars,We had fun walking around people and car watching. Parking was easy in lots that were reasonably priced. Go to Sugarfina for a small free candy.,Dana Q
40,Always fun,This is always fun and you don't need to spend a fortune. There are plenty of places to eat and drink at reasonable prices in the adjoining streets,Kenshare
30,Another Unnecessary Must Do,"So over rated, a road where rich people shop, but we all drive down Rodeo Drive to say we've done it. We have done it a few times, because we are usually with friends who want to do it.There are so many better things to do with your time than Rodeo Drive.",john j
50,Wow,We had a great time window shopping and fantasizing about being able to afford shopping here. We saw a few Bentley’s and such. It was fun.,blondi1517
50,Best Place to watch fancy cars!,Stayed at Beverly Wilshire over the weekend and my husband and I had fun watching Porsches and Ferraris drive by. Great spot to people watch and shop!,Erma RW
30,Unique bit of reality,"The short few blocks section of this street has the leading top of the line iconic expensive international brand names, one right next to the other. Of course in unique California style. A street level experience of the 1/10th of 1% shop. Be sure to have your credit card ready.",Mohan B
40,"If you are in BH, don't miss it","There are actually some 2 hour free garages. Park and walk and maybe even buy something. The Rodeo Collection has Tiffany's and other shops and it's across from the hotel where they shot Pretty Woman. If you are dressed nicely, go inside!",Cie S
30,Nice place to walk around,"My teenagers were obsessed about going to rodeo drive but were slightly deflated once they got there and saw that they could buy absolutely nothing! Store browsing is amazing, people watching is amazing , car gazing is amazing and shopping is frustrating!One block off rodeo drive are more normal every day shops. So my teens had a great time being able to pick up some items that were more affordable. There’s a great macaroon place that is so stinking sweet , I could’ve just stayed there all day.Tip:Go shopping there on Sunday parking is free. Most stores open by 11:00.",Jen P
40,Vacation in Los Angeles,"It was cool to walk up and down a famous street, Rodeo Drive. The area is well kept. The residential area nearby is well manicured.",Jacquelyn U

30,Wasn’t that impressed,"Since pretty woman made rodeo drive the “it” place, I was kind of disappointed that it had many of the same shops all over the USA and not many speciality stores. Still fun to walk around and see how the other half live!",Judy L
10,A tourist trap,"This street is always jam packed with tourists. Locals avoid it like the plague. Having lived in Los Angeles all my life and having worked in Beverly HIlls for many years, I have a rule of thumb about Rodeo Drive: Avoid it. Overprice and jammed with people, most of whom could not even begin to afford the jacked prices that its stores charge.",Double Scrutiny
50,Great area to visit,Rodeo drive is only 3 block long in the center of Beverly Hills which makes it very easy to visit. It is small but it is packed with very high class stores. the street itself is very beautiful with great decorations and very safe.,IlanTtravel
50,Rodeo Drive Baby,It was everything I imagined. Just awesome. Seeing the Beverly Wiltshire where Pretty Woman was made. All the designer shops etc. A must visit.,Robyn F
50,Classy and Beautiful,"Wow! Rodeo Drive is one of the best places ever. Extremely classy, clean, and upscale. The area is very safe as well. The employees in the stores are knowledgeable and helpful. Though many would expect Rodeo Drive to only have expensive things, there is also many stores that are very affordable overall or have affordable things there. I was very impressed with all the stores and how well everything is done there. The food they have is excellent! I highly recommend ""Il Fornaio Beverly Hills""-- great Italian restaurant.",Paige McFarland
50,Great Shopping and Cool Cars,"We enjoyed lots of great shopping like Balenciaga, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Goyard. It’s always exciting to see the cars and occasional celebs that frequent the area. Definitely a must see place when in the area.",Greg H

30,It's OK,Living in Miami for many years it's not a big deal. May be for some people outside the US or mid-country is impressive. Some brand shops for average person to get exited. Nothing special AT ALL.,LynnM112017
40,Rodeo Drive ?. Pronounced Rodayo !!!!,A walk along Rodeo Dve is a confounding exposure to people with too much money . I guess it is a highlight in LA for some . The contrasts in this city are disturbing with extreme wealth and extreme poverty a few streets away . Where are the high profile wealthy and what are they doing for those in need . These retail stores need to have some form of charity about them .,Stuart D
40,Rodeo driving for the top couture,"If you in Los Angeles are, and even if you don’t you don’t want to buy a Cartier watch, you can’t miss the experience of exploring Rodeo Drive. It’s fun to look at all the young and not so young people in their buying spree. And if want a Cartier or a Rolex, like Roger Federer even better. Go for it and enjoy the drive!",Nelson C
30,Iconic Street... nice to view but only for the rich to shop,"If you are in LA then of course this is a must... it is an iconic place so absolutely one to walk where the beautiful people shop... unless you have a big wallet then shopping here won't be for you with all the designer shops you can mention. The street is lovely, very clean, wide boulevard, very pretty with some nice hotels, restaurants and cafes which you may choose to frequent.",travellerm68
30,Beautiful,"A nice walk with beautiful shops, most if which are too $$$ to shop in. Shop keepers not as friendly as other parts of LA. Loads of cars driving with windows down & music blaring",Lyndell P P

50,Shopping Heaven,"This area has great designer attire available. If you need or want it, you can find it on Rodeo Drive. Dining, shopping, hair, nail salons.

20,"if you ain't buyin, keep movin","I'm definitely not the target market for wall-to-wall global designer brands but was curious so we drove through on our way back from somewhere.Yes, all the luxury brands were there and yes, they looked fabulous and glitzy. I wouldn't want to try to park anywhere but noted some places offered valet parking (presumably if your car was up to scratch). Noted a number of tourist buses but if you are very image conscious that would be a bad move.I suppose if you were spending someone else's money or had a black credit card this is the place to go but yeh, nah.",occasional_typo

Now, to be clear, we weren't actually shopping.These are extremely high end places and we were only window shopping and dreaming of what it's like to shop in these places! But it was fun to see. You'll see tourists, of course, but you'll see some that you just know are walking their pooch and casually shopping the morning away dropping some serious cash! Fancy cars everywhere and clean and pristine! Fun to go see!",Summer R
30,Just a fancy shopping location.,"As you'd expect being in Beverly Hills, every shop is pretty much a premium store. A lot of items in certain stores didn't even have price labels on which told us that it's very expensive. I wouldn't say it's a definite must visit but it's interesting just to see this huge culture difference of wealth - there was a gold plated Gucci store! It's very touristy during peak season times with everyone pretty much taking selfies etc, and you get the odd celebrity walking the streets too. When we were there the actor from Doctor Who was casually strolling around. In summary If you're staying relatively close then I'd say it's worth going to, otherwise you're not missing out on too much.",Chris S

50,It's Rodeo Drive baby...,"For most, Rodeo Drive is a shooting location in Pretty Woman, but for us that live in Beverly Hills, it's where we go to shop for everyday and special, one-of-a-kind items. While the boutiques on Rodeo, that are between Wilshire and Little Santa Monica, are all luxury and high end, the side streets and those on Beverly tend to have something for everyone. Start early, walk down the street, listen to Roy Orbison, buy a little something to take home and have a great lunch at the Beverly Wilshire, Mr. Chow or Spago. You never know, Julia Roberts might be at the next table!",Shane R
40,Window shopping only!,"Worth walking around just to take it all in. We went into a couple of shops, but walked out empty handed, which I was expecting. I tried to warn my husband but I guess he thought I was kidding. I just slowly lifted his jaw off the ground. :)",Lara L

50,Beautiful everything!,"My first trip to Rodeo Drive and it was simply stated, beautiful! The weather, the sunny skies, the clean boutiques and the drive along Rodeo drive itself was just magical. I love experiencing new laces, sights and sounds and this met all of those! It was just a great experience!",hdbelle2
50,Good shopping and restaurants,Rodeo has some great shopping options and restaurants too. You can find valet parking randomly throughout the street or within the neighborhood but there are also a few two hour free parking lots that are great.,Joe M
50,Still the Place,"Impossible to describe, but if you’ve seen Pretty Woman, you can get a sense of it...conspicuous consumption from cars on the roadway to the streetscape of people and places. Take out your wallet or just go without it. Can only get into some serious expenditures! But, have fun!!",PlatinumHoney
50,5 stars if you like to spend on shopping,"I give Rodeo Drive 5 stars if you love to spend on shopping. When you get tired and need someplace to eat/drink, there are restaurants/cafes close to the area.",Wanderlust
50,Flash and lots of Cash,A must visit but be prepared to spend too much !!All the designers and all the most beautiful people and objects you can imagine.Great restaurants for very delicious and expensive food.A treat for the senses and the designer must haves of this world.,Margrit W
30,Out of my budget,Fun to say we were on Rodeo Drive but that was about it . Enjoyed Hollywood Blvd much better !Definitely not a place I would visit again !,parselll
50,You just have to see it.,You may not shop there but it is great to see what goes into the store fronts and displays a bit of fun and star searching.,Henry D
50,Remember Pretty Woman?,"Feeling like Pretty Woman? Walk along this pretty and one of the cleanest street I've seen in LA :) Lots of high-end shops around...Good to pass by even if you're not shopping, the Beverly Hills sign is in a walking distance nearby...",Making_Memories
30,Nothing really special,I am not a fashion bug. I came here because my friend from Asia is visiting LA. Of course we had to come to the Rodeo drive.Not sure how many rich local people or famous people you can see here. We might have spotted one or two. All other people we ran into are tourists like us.Recommended if you have never been here. Plan for an hour. We finished our visit within an hour. The merchandise sold here is beyond our ability to buy. There was not even any window shopping because we knew we could not afford it.,BHUANG69
50,Of course have to wander around here,Every body has heard of Rodeo Drive and wandering around doesn’t disappoint. It’s pristine and beautiful. We looked and didn’t buy.Nearby is Sprinkles- a great cupcake shop with an atm type delivery system for 24hours takeaways - neat.,PKC54
50,Completely lives up to its reputation!,My daughter and I enjoyed a long slow stroll all the way up Rodeo Drive from the gorgeous leafy suburban homes all the way up to the end of the glitzy high end boutiques and brand stores in the sunshine under the palm tree lined avenue of shops! I even enjoyed a free natural ‘facelift’ from one of the beauty spas as I am bad at saying no to salesmen 😂 it was great fun and I looked ten years younger even if only for the evening!!,debrie123
50,A wonderful stroll and great people watching,"It’s hard to go to Beverly Hills and not take a stroll down the world famous Rodeo Drive. This truly is the place for ultra high end shopping and equivalently high end people watching.While you might not end up buying anything, it’s still worth the walk down this quiet cobblestone pedestrian way to window shop some of the worlds best brands.While we didn’t spy any celebrities - that’s a favorite pastime here as well.",James S
50,Bring Your Sugar Daddy,"Spent a gorgeous, sunny day walking the pristine sidewalks of Rodeo. Lovely shops with courteous staff. Bought my first pair of Jimmy Choo's.",Katy C
50,Top of the Top,"This is a must, whether you can afford the prices or not. Take a leisurely walk and enjoy the shops and the people around you!",Dewey G
50,Feeling Special!,"The shop owners were very nice, nobody was snobby and I really enjoyed my time of Rodeo. In this day of online shopping it was fun to go into the beautiful stores and touch and feel like the good old days of shopping. I was even given a glass of champagne in Burberry. Thank you Beverly Hills for all the fun!",lonewolf1111
50,"Short, just a few blocks but iconic",Who would miss the short walk down Rodeo Drive on the way to evening drinks at the Beverly Wilshire? A must do for those in the area but leave your credit cards at home!,Shane Zieck
20,Not touristic,"I red that is a touristic place but I don't understand what is touristic in this place. There are just luxury shops, nothing interesting.",Luca C
30,Fun to see one time,"Although we walked around Rodeo Drive and the surrounding area, we had no desire to enter a store as everything is so ridiculously expensive. Not sure what the big deal is about shopping here. Oh, well, we enjoyed strolling around on a sunny day.",Maui2014NMR
50,Really Nice,"I was stolling there at night and i really like it, it was peaceful and it was amazing how all the shops were designed.",Eulàlia B
20,Not impressed,"OK it is a legend of a road. Fancy, upscale, higher/high priced stores. If your into these things it is worth a stop and look. If your burger-n-fries type then drive by quickly and go see something interesting.",Bee Cool Travel
40,Our visit love to shop,Well it was lovely and very clean .it lacks coffee shops which even Mayfair and park lane have in London which draws people to spend large amounts of money .i must say I did get board and lost interest .,Eleanorakanel
30,Worth a look,"It’s a place that is worth an hour or two. We weren’t in the market for a $400 purse or a $10,000 necklace but the stores were nice",Lynn_from_WI
40,Stunning,One to go for for everyone. Top names crammed into a very small area makes it easy shopping. Parking was available valet too very reasonable.,Karl R
30,"Lovely, if somewhat unapproachable","Imagine the most upscale shopping mall you've ever been to, then plot the stores onto a beautiful street in the elegant, expensive city off Beverly Hills. That's Rodeo Drive. And while I would have loved to go into some stores just to look at their wares, such as Tiffany, simply didn't make you feel terribly welcome. Still, it's a must-do to fill out your LA-area visit. Do it on a beautiful SoCal day., and try and buy something (budget allowing) just so you can say you ""went shopping on Rodeo Drive!""",Bill O
50,Luxurious and iconic street,"Visited here and saw beautiful cars and also women, loved the place and very very iconic, worth a while to spend your time here",Christopher Navas Go
40,Beautiful street,"The stores and the houses surrounding this street are beautiful. It is only a few blocks that you need to walk and there are public parkings nearby, so you dont have to worry about that. For me beverly hills was the nicest neighborhood in Los Angeles.",Food & Travel
40,Iconic street,"We meandered in an out of shops with price tags you shouldn’t look at. The highlight was a gallery where we got to check out some original Dali, Picasso etc which were also available for purchase!! Highlight was a terrific lunch at Rodeo 208. Rodeo drive is not a must see, but we had not been there in two visits so thought we better check it out.",Shane D
30,What the big deal?,I'm not sure what the big deal is? It is a number of expensive retail stores....for most of us we would never buy anything here.,vernons79
40,Glamorous street,"You’ll get to see all the glamorous, high-end fashion brands shops along this short stretch. Lots of selfie photo opportunities available. If you don’t have the budget, window shopping is just fine. Lots of fine cars too. Security is quite visible. Parking is available.",mike321ph
40,Wow if only!,"This is one street for the rich and famous. Amazing cars, great to have a wander. Don’t look at the price tags, if there are any 😳",MLGTRD
50,Open your eyes,"Dear readers,Rodeo drive has all the brands you are looking for. Nearly every boutique has a security Man at the door and you might see a VIP driving up and they open the car door for him, or her.This place is nice to walk and shop if you have extra money.Or just to look and window shop.It’s very fancy,Enjoy it!Regards Petra",petraalmutawa
50,Luxury at its best,"Forget about Dubai. I think the luxury level here is much higher than Dubai. Cars, shops, tourists, and all the buzzing and bling bling.If you want to shop until you drop, come here. Don’t worry about being feeling hungry, because there are so many nice places to eat too.",Jason526
30,"Do your V, continue with your visit...","Nothing to write home about, beside saying you were there. Compare with Orchard road (Singapore), Kudamm (Berlin) and the likes - it lost it’s leading advantage points...",Airsealands
40,Something to tick off your list !!,"Great visit to say you’ve been, but realistically you can’t go on a shopping spree anytime soon. Great with the sun being out and people watching - but you can’t spend much time there unless you have lots of spare cash!!For those who just want their picture near the Rodeo Drive sign and to grab a drink - park at the parking lot next door to ‘what goes around comes around’ as 2 hours free parking (yes we are from Yorkshire, UK) !!",Rachel B
50,A Walk Along Beverly Hills' Most Famous Street - Rodeo Drive,"A walk in the park (NO), A walk on the wild side (No) A walk on the streets of Gold (No) A walk to remember...YES. Looking for something to do...why not, take a walk along Rodeo Drive and throughout the posh streets of Beverly Hills. Do some shopping, People Watch, Grab a Bite to eat and if you get a chance step inside that Big Golden Box located on the corner of Rodeo and snap a Selfie. This is something you'll find only on Rodeo Drive and a fun way for us tourist to remember a leisurely afternoon in Beverly Hills.",Chiefcita
30,Rodeo Drive,"Maybe because I live here I really just don’t get it. There are so many wonderful things to do in Los Angeles. Walking on Rodeo Drive, taking selfies in front of fancy stores seems like a waste of time to me. Yet the area is filled with tourists from all over the world, all of the time. I’d rather go to LACMA, Peterson Car Museum, Fowler ethnographic museum at UCLA, Huntington Gardens in Pasadena, wander through the ethnic areas of Los Angeles, stopping for interesting foods and designs, etc. When I visit foreign countries, my last thought is to visit a Rodeo Drive type of place. Give me Central Market or the local Flea markets any time.",lovestravel100Ca
50,Lovely shopping street,It's Beverly Hills baby!! If yu are going shopping to buy or window shop ... th best agree the best street in Beverly hills is Rodeo drive where all th designer shops are and it's fabulous !!It's a great street to stroll down and see so much magnificent retail !!Have fun!! Great shops and little eateries too !!,superamelia
50,Just looking!,"I love walking Rodeo Drive! The shops are elegant, the fashions supreme! The best in the world. And what a car show! Never without the most elegant or the most exotic. Do not covet, do not envy, just appreciate!",Suzanne7Losangeles
50,Everything Expected,"This was an experience of a lifetime. Clean, friendly and fun place to spend an afternoon. We were treated no differently then someone who was a millionaire. The one shop that stood out was Fendi. They let me try a purse on even though I said I could never afford it. Well dine Fendi!",Beverly F
50,very clean and up scale,"This was a stop along the way in LA. Although the stores are very expensive, it is a nice place to visit. It is very clean. Interesting to see the rich side of society. I would recommend to visit.",Renee K
30,Just your average high-end stores,"Very expensive stores in the area, but nice to walk and worth a stop for tourists - at least once. However, the famed street is not nearly as pretty and charming as 5th avenue in Naples, Florida. I believe this street is probably one of the few streets in the Los Angeles area that isn't filled with grime, garbage and bums. This is my recent opinion having stayed a few days in West Hollywood. Years ago (25+) Rodeo drive was epic, as was most of Los Angeles.",toadsoup
40,Lots of High End Stores,"If you need to ask the price, you can't afford it. That pretty much sums up most of the stores on Rodeo Drive. There are plenty of parking lots but if you find a parking spot on the street, it's $2 for a maximum of an hour on the meter.",gl0baltraveler
50,“Rodeo drive baby”,"This is worth the walk. Parking is a pain, but if you can find parking... do it! Great place for pictures and if you are a Pretty Woman fan...it’s a must! We went into the Beverly Wilshire, 😳😍, walked down the strip, and took many pictures.",Angelique717
40,Move on up,"Worth a quick tourist stop, with free parking in nearby parking lots (why free here for the rich but not so for most of the rest of the city?!). It was more what I thought LA would be like than the quite-dirty-in-places boulevard. But still just an expensive shopping street, albeit with the Beverly Hills sign nearby (undergoing refurbishment), so move on quickly",stonerose5
30,Not mandatory,"OK, you can't leave LA without visiting this street if you're a fashion victim. However, if you're a common tourist, don't expect anything apart from shops.",arce69zamora
50,"Just what I expected... expensive shops , but fun to window shop","Have seen Rodeo drive on TV. Very glamorous, expensive stores. Fancy cars parked on street. There is a small section of Rodeo drive that weaves up a short hill and reminds me of streets in Europe. Since I live near New York, I have been in most of the stores on 5th Avenue or Madison Avenue, but on Rodeo Drive, all in a few blocks is easy to walk in and out of. Spent about one hour and saw just enough shops. Glad we went to see rodeo dr",LeeMahwah
40,No Prices on the Merch,"Everyone should take a walk down Rodeo Drive just to get a load of the shopping habits of the rich and/or famous. The stores, ie. Gucci, Versace, Louis Vuitton, etc. are all over staffed with well dressed sales people who, largely, have very little to do. In most cases, there are no prices on any of the items because, I suppose, if you have to ask, you don’t belong there. Don’t look for any medium or large sizes and, Heaven forbid, if you’re a curvy woman. However, it’s an interesting experience.",Jo v
50,Expensive,"Now, i am one for shopping, but this place is over rated and over priced for no reason. I have the money to spend, but just to say i bought from this area, not even worth it. It is very clean and a busy area, but not worth the money. You will see alot of celebrities down there, but not worth the time and energy.",ninasexy256
50,In your dreams!!!,"You have to see it to believe it. Beautiful high end shops. All the top designers are here.Amazing cars. Just great fun,people watching. Lots of nice restaurants and bars around. Well worth a visit. More people window shopping than buying!!!",Julie M
50,Great window watching,We can’t or won’t afford to shop or eat here but it was fun to wander and window watch and Especially to people watch. (I wanted to be the girl in ‘Pretty Women’ having my partner give his credit card to a shop keeper and tell her to give me everything I wanted ... but he wouldn’t.),booptraveler
50,Where Bling is the Thing,A fun street to stroll at anytime of day or night. The stores and displays are over the top. There is feel good music coming from the palm trees. Ridiculously expensive cars rolling by. Porsches and Mercedes are like Volkswagens in this neighborhood. If you can't afford a Rolls or Bentley or Ferrari well really!,canuck22SanFrancisco
40,Loved everybit of this place,Rodea drive is one place u must visit to get the vibe of hollywood and LA. I was happy to drive around the streets and eat at some great restaurants. You can site some super sexy vehicles parked and great crowd overalll.,RatishNair
40,A bit underwhelming,"Rodeo Drive is a luxury shopping Mecca made famous of course by Pretty Woman. It is a bit underwhelming in real life as it is relatively a short street (as far as the shops are concerned). It is part of a triangle of streets that offer high-end designer wear shopping in Beverly Hills so is better considered that way than as a standalone. Still, go there, pretend you are Julia Roberts or Richard Gere and live it up!",Peter N
40,Luxury Shopping,You have all the high end luxury stores in one location. Its just another shopping plaza that consist of stores on both sides of the street.,352MD
40,Trendy,"You feel the diference. It is like you hear in TV. Fancy cars, fancy caffes and restaurants. Very fancy stores and guests. It is a must in LA. It is great to walk and drink coffee, watch people and feel you are part of the jet-set! Very nice experience",juan diver
40,Quick drive,We just drove through but wish we wouldve had more time.the area was clean . very very beautiful!! Lots of places to shop... Would definitely return.,Anichols39

50,Quick visit,We stop on Rodeo Drive and Beverly Drive for about an hour and then had dinner at one of the many great restaurants in the area. Very clean area. Friendly people throughout and very accessible parking available.,O1628YTedwardh
40,Fun to Say You Went,"We went and it was pouring down rain but I wanted to at least drive the street. It was fun to even drive it. There are expensive and not so expensive stores that are in our normal mall back home, I dont know if they carry the more expensive stuff but I would say if you enjoy fashion to make sure to check out this set of stores even to browse. Parking was difficult to find.",Breanne07
50,"Awesome Experience, Once in a Lifetime!","What an experience! I love to shop, but I loved seeing the expressions on my children's faces when they saw the awesome cars more! It was such a memorable experience just to drive up and down Rodeo Drive and experience the feeling of ""lifestyles of the rich and famous!"" The shop owners were very friendly and we even purchased a few things while we were here. We love Beverly Hills and can't wait to go back!",Barb M
50,Rodeo Drive matches the hype,We had heard about the fancy Rodeo Drive previously. It was nice to walk up and down the drive. We did a little shopping as well. It was great to see the people.,BrainofSocrates
50,Nice little walk,"Must go, it’s a 10 minutes walk back and forth, as almost places you will pay parking around $20. Most expensive and luxurious stores and brands from all around the globe.",Ricky
50,Do it!,You should go even if you can just afford a hair pin. It's an immaculate street. The people watching is lovely. And the cars driving by will sure to make you feel like you're in Pretty Woman. Go!,mcdinnj
50,Walking down Rodeo Drive was fun.,We went to Rodeo Drive the night before the Oscars and it was busy and fun. There were a lot of closed events the stars were attending. We walked through many stores. A lot of fancy cars driving up & down Rodeo Dr showing off.,goodmom1
50,Such a beautiful shopping area,Cool area with many shopping options. There is beautiful buildings and lots of great restaurants in the area.,Wilson L
40,Just Looking,"We had 1 day in LA and decided to go to Rodeo Drive. Much smaller than I imagined, but lined with very expensive stores. Most stores had a security guard at the door and nothing inside had price tags. I guess if you have to ask the price you can't afford it!A lovely street lined with palm trees, seating areas here and there. We bought an ice cream from an ice cream truck and sat and ate it, at least we can say we bought something on Rodeo Drive!We even managed to get free valet parking! (less than 2 hours and it's free)",Karen C
30,Nothing Special,"This is an usual street and not as beautiful as others on Beverly Hills. Nice place for a walk, several of the most known brands, but nothing different than that",Gabriel S
50,What’s Not To Like,"This street is legendary for a reason. Every luxury brand that you may think of within reach and excellent service in every boutique. And, really find the music played in the street a mood lifting experience. Go, if only for the music :)",Thomas Serup
50,Wold-renown Shopping Area in Beverly Hills,"It is not just a street, it is an attraction. Thousands of tourists are drawn every year to see Rodeo Drive, a world-renown shopping street in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.

It faces Beverly-Wilshire Hotel with its famous ""Cut"", across the street, in Montage Hotel, is famous Bouchon, next door is Hollywood jewel - Spago (creation of Wolfgang Puck) and many others. One Rodeo - is recreating the beginning of the ""golden era"", also full of high-end stores and restaurants. If you are in Los Angeles, Rodeo Drive visit is a must!",SidBeverlyHills

40,Just Window Shopping,"Ha ha, the streets were beautifully kept, lined with all the top designer shops; Vera Wang, Dolce, Tiffany’s etc. personally what I like most was seeing all the expensive cars: beautiful Maserati’s (yes plural, I saw 3), Tesla’s ( at least 4), they sound so beautiful going down the road, if you like that type of thing, Rolls Royce’s, Older Bentley’s etc. It was pretty amazing. The area is so gorgeous, lovely landscaping.",Cher1999
40,Highly interesting,Great place to go and see where the upper crust does their shopping. Saw a group of people standing around looking at a Bugatti. Didn’t know why untill I looked it up and found out it was a 2 million dollar car. Wonder who drove it. Not one of my circle of friends.,Sheldon H
50,Exactly let’s or in the movies,Was my first visit to Los Angeles and Beverly Hills and it really lived up to my expectations. Loved Rodeo Drive!!!,constantingm
20,Rodeo... I guess You gotta See It!,"It’s a street! An expensive street to shop on or in, of course! I’ve made it in a store there before, but not this trip. It’s cool to see it and envision those who can shop there. But I’ll pass on stopping by or stopping because it’s a little to rich for my wallet or taste, at this time. Perhaps one day, right!",Adventuresofsonyat
50,Very Posh,A place only for the very rich. You will lot of big branded/designer shops. Don't be surprised if you see posh cars and even celebrities.,Ravindra V
30,I can now check Rodeo Drive off my list.,The last time I visited Beverly Hills for work I didn’t make it to Rodeo Drive and felt obliged to do it when I returned again. Well I did and now I can cross that off my list. It’s neat and the architecture of the buildings is cool and artsy but considering I can’t afford to shop at any of the stores it just didn’t do much for me. I don’t feel any desire to go back and see it again. It’s just a street with fancy stores. It was a bit of a downer actually! But I’m glad to have done it now.,SouthernBelles98
50,Must see,We brought the kids and are glad we did!Opulence and over the top would be a good way to describe.We walked the entire drive looking at the shops and taking in the well dressed people and admired the cars littered along the street and driving by!Go and see for yourself how the ‘other half’ lives - was fun and eye opening.,James F

40,It's Rodeo Drive!,"We had a walk around Rodeo Drive, to say we'd 'done it'.... it's all blase, hype...and people renting fast cars to drive round in for the afternoon. Absolutely loved the whole ambiance, but did find it so false! My husband remarked that he'd seen the same woman four times (there is a certain 'look' on Rodeo!!) Anyway, go for a schmooze, treat it for what it is....it's a name of a couple of roads, with expensive shops, it's cool and fun to people watch! By the way, RD you are severely lacking in Vegan restaurants, it's the next big thing.... so get with the programme.",RescuedVegan
40,Iconic Place of course!,This iconic shopping venue was super crowded during the President's Day weekend. Gorgeous shops and helpful shopkeepers.,nailsAtlanta

40,Interesting,Mix of tourists and rich looking people. Lots of amazing cars driving down rodeo so if you're into that have a seat and take in the beauty. The people watching is interesting also. We didn't see any celebs as others indicated but that's ok. It was a weird view into how the absurdly rich shop!!,Jodi S
40,Fun drive down Rodeo,"We took the opportunity to drive up and down Rodeo drive a few times just for fun. We did not get out and walk around, but had fun looking at all the stores, cars and people from the car.",Dianna N
50,Glamorous for what it is,"You come to Rodeo drive just to gently touch and hardly feel the glamour, fame and richness. If your not some high end celebrity or billionaire don’t come expecting anything else. It’s a genuinely beautiful street. The shops look fabulous and the atmosphere is electrifying. So fun to stroll around, “window shop” and enjoy it all for a while. There is no proper visit to LA without it!",meyravg
30,No Big Deal,A bunch of high end stores that you can not enter. Ten minutes to walk up and down and window shop? Time better spent else where,rockcole
40,Envious,"Great place to walk and window shop. The prices are through the roof. Only a lucky and select group of people could actually afford to pay for anything here, certainly not us!! Never saw any famous people.",OpinionGuru
30,Okay if you are rich.,"We walked Rodeo Drive for the experience. Lovely, clean streets, many very expensive parked cars and designer clothes displayed in the windows, There are no prices on the clothes, so unable to guess how much. Okay for the experience but over rated and to me no different than being in Harrodsburg or walking down Regents Street. These designer shops can also be found in Dubai.Good for the experience and people watching. Most shops had tables and chairs where you can sit. I wondered whether these were for customers.",Debbie Q
50,Excellent expensive experience,"It was great just to drive down this famous street, surrounded by BMW, Jaguars, Lexus, corvettes, & to window shop, at the fine things, to purchase!!",Kathleen B
50,Just for Your Eyes,"It is incredible how this place is kind of an island of exuberance in the middle of a normal town.The parade of ferraris, rolls royces, jaguars and bentleys is incredible.The stores are for your eyes only (at least for me).",mattos_family
50,Ritzy part of Beverly Hills,"If you are coming to the Los Angeles area, you have to go to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Plenty of parking and it's best to walk around the streets. Very nice, but expensive shops to choose from and plenty of places to eat. Fun place to go for a few hours of sight seeing.",mcorbin560
40,Browse or shop if you dare!,"Better on a weekend if you just want the experience-better on a week day if you plan to shop.Definitely an experience if you’ve never been. Will probably take a couple of days to see it all well.Lots of restaurants too. Do your research. Price ranges all over the place from what the employees around there can afford to... well...just about anything. All of it is good.There are City parking lots that offer a couple of hours free. If you park on the street make sure you keep an eye on the time for the meter.Whatever you do, you’ll have a good time and make memories!Enjoy!",judysinger
30,It does what it says on the tin.,Very very expensive. Lots if shoppers but very few shopping bags!!!!Certainly a must see if only on a tour bus to say you have been there. Clearly the place is immaculate and very up market. You can get low cost parking on the parallel street a couple of hours for 5 dollars which is more than enough time if your in your own car.,portfolioman
50,Iconic always,"We felt like movie stars out of a movie while we window shopped down this famous stretch of pristine beauty in the heart of Beverly Hills. The weather was perfect, the company was perfect, and it was an early Sunday morning stroll to get breakfast. It will always remind my of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. This is where dreams come true on Rodeo Drive.",laurieSue

30,High end stores on a beautiful street,All the designer stores you can think of but prices are higher then you can find elsewhere. The stores are just a beautiful that you will find in Rome or any other major city. The service is excellent in the stores and everyone is very helpful. I was disappointed pointed though when I saw the prices. Purses were about $500.00 more than yiu can find in Rome even with the conversion of the dollar to the Euro.,Chiili
50,Amazing,"We had to walk Rodeo Drive in LA. Some of the shops we stepped into were very welcoming , such as COACH, which also offered products which aren't available elsewhere. They also have an on site area for customizing, which was a pleasant surprise. The stores are very luxurious, yet the sales people in most were not friendly or helpful. Reminded me of ""Pretty Woman""",Lillie H
40,Worth a walk,"Beautiful shops, imaginative windows filled with gorgeous clothes or accessories, and perfect weather made strolling this area a worthwhile stop. Especially if “Pretty Woman” is one of your favorite movies. Julia Roberts was nowhere to be seen though. All the luxury brands were front and center. Cartier, Dolce and Gabanna, Gucci, Celine, Louis Vuitton, etc. Loved it!",houstontravelingfool

30,I Was Expecting More,"I was disappointed when I saw Rodeo Drive, we were on a LA City Tour and yes it has all the high end stores, but not much different to other ritzy areas I have been to, saw a couple of nice cars, the tour guide pointed out the store that Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman) went too, no Hollywood Stars, actually there was not much happening at all maybe I was expecting to much.",Dell E.

10,The foulest place on earth,"I hated every minute of being on Rodeo Drive. It houses a collection of decadence which attracts the most vulgar human beings to the worship of money and wealth.

50,Wonderful passagatta,"Great shops. Fun afternoon. You can find anything you ever could want or wish on one street. Have been out here since the 70’s and it is always a great.

30,A temple to consumerism,My view of our time on Rodeo Drive would differ widely from my teenage boys. Other than a fine procession of expensive cars (alternating with gawking tourists in chevys) I saw little to recommend this site. My sons were sure to take their picture in front of Gucci to send to their friends but for the most part it feels vacuous and fake.,Kris J
30,Boring actually,"Drove down looked around in the windows because you could tell the shops are only frequented by the very rich. You don’t try on the clothes, they are tried on for you. Lol. I didn’t see one single famous person but did see black SUVs with mega tinted windows with drivers standing outside the vehicle seemingly waiting for their passenger so I assume it’s a rich person shopping. You should at least drive down to say you’ve been....",geezette1

50,The best luxury fashion street in the world,I work in fashion and i’ve been everywhere from Paris London Milano but i would say Rodeo drive is the best for me where you can feel the real luxury around and beauty of the street and surrounding you should definitely visit if you’re around if you wanna feel in a fancy Hollywood movie...,ariozfashion
50,Plenty of high end shopping in one area! Great place to see a famous person!,We like cruising up and down Rodeo Drive. Great place to shop for your loved ones. Located near restaurants and food vendors. There is definitely a little of something for everyone. Consider this to be a small version of Hollywood. The shopping can overwhelm you if the people and cars don’t. We were in the area during Christmas so it was packed for the holidays. It is a very famous spot and a must see travel destination for any and all who come to LA! Great place with amazing items to buy.,Yehbut

50,"Fun, But Expensive Shopping","While with a group on a tour of LA several summers ago, we went to Rodeo Drive for an afternoon of strolling around & shopping. It was fun to go into several of the very upscale & classy shops & compare those stores to NY's 5th Ave stores. My wife bought a nice outfit & I got a couple of shirts & a very expensive tie. They even shipped the items back home to NY. Now I have shopped in the very best of 5th Ave. N.Y. & Rodeo Drive.I also enjoyed walking around the lobby of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel ""a.k.a. ""The Pretty Woman Hotel"" which is the location of some scenes from Julia Roberts & Richard Gere's movie.",GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat
50,Amazing shops but bring your credit cards!,Obviously this is the famous street from pretty women and I would say it's defiantly worth a stroll down whilst in Beverly Hills even if you aren't shopping but if you are make sure you bring all credit cards as it's all quite pricey! There's lots of lovely coffee shops and small restaurants to eat in that are fairly priced! Parking is also very easy.,Joeyanna1234

We drove up and down it then got out and walked around, we looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. Got back in the car and drove away. So why not go to a high priced mall??

30,Nice walking,Rodeo drive is a street packed with expensive stores. Very fancy. Good to take a look around and maybe take some photos. Nothing special about it at all.,Francisco E
30,Not What It Was But Still Fun,"This street has changed a lot. Saks et al opening in the Middle East, stymied the flow of Arab princes and princesses coming to visit. 9/11 was the beginning of the end of the Russian Mafia coming to launder cash and the internet has changed shopping habits. That said it's still fun people watching, you still have the Gucci store, Harry Winston, Cartier, Tiffany, Lalique, Brooks Brothers, Bijan and various other tony boutiques. You'll still see a Bugatti or get yourself a very expensive new haircut at Fekkai's. Eating is good in this area but maybe one street over either side. You'll still see wannabee actresses in too tight dresses and heels they can't walk on trying to be ""seen"". Have fun, take photos, dream a little and remember the sale items will be at the back of the stores.",Michael S

The drive has never looked as beautiful at night as it does now and the stores are even open late. I make a point of talking a regular walk on Rodeo a few nights per week. I never get tired of the looking at the decorations, listening to the music and peeking into the store windows. It's a great excuse to get some fresh air and experience shopping outside a mall or theme park. And the best thing as far as I'm concerned is the price - free.",MemberSince70

40,Too cute for words!,"Rodeo Drive is all the cliche and more that one would expect from seeing it on TV. It is exactly what you see... couture stores, shops of well-known American designers and high-end boutiques. And of course, it wouldn’t be “Rodeo Drive” without seeing high-performance sports cars and luxury vehicles cruising around, which we did. The chandelier light posts are pretentious (totally the point) but absolutely adorable! It was a cool experience to shop and purchase items from retailers on this iconic stretch of road.",CoutureTexan

50,I Love this Street.,This street just drips money. We had a great time dreaming about what I could buy and just enjoyed walking around the beautifully flower and tree adorned streets. We did buy a necklace from one shop just so we could say we bought something on Rodeo Drive. Don't get excited....it was $25 :),Karen S
50,A Christmas Light Extravaganza,"As beautiful by night as it is by day, don't miss this stunning (albeit beyond expensive) little cobblestone street (Via Rodeo) and the shops lit up and decorated for Christmas.

40,"Tourists Abound, But BH is Really Pleasant & Inviting","I'm a native of LA, and I also work in BH. I walk outside to get lunch a few days a week and constantly see just how extremely pleasant Beverly Hills is and even how pleasant crowded Rodeo Drive is. It's easy to park because there are many 1 and 2-hour free city parking lots,and there are great restaurants to enjoy. I especially like the Tory Burch store on Rodeo because it has plush velvet couches to sit in when you try on shoes and they provide bottled water and service with a smile. Plus, there is something dreamy about walking down Rodeo Drive, as if one is walking within a fantasy realm where happiness is just a purchase away and all other cares dissipate into the ether.",Melissa D
30,Lavish super-upscale shops,"I was playing tour guide and my friends wanted to see Rodeo Dr. The stores are beautiful with the most pristine and beautifully made products in many cases void of price tags. In most stores we walked in we were ""watched"" but not greeted. I'm guessing we did not look like ""their"" customers. The only shop we entered where the staff was lovely and engaging was Burberry's. For this I commend them because one should never judge a book by a cover. Music was blaring from the center divide. I don't know if this is always of for the holidays.",Nancy D
40,Good to look around,Nice to wander around . You never know who you will see. The high end shops don't welcome you much if they see you are a tourist. Nice coffee shops. Highlight was going into Tiffany diamond shop and being dazzled by all the lively rings.,Ripitup2014
30,Rodeo Drive Baby,"Walking down Rodeo Drive is kinda like a MUST DO when visiting LA for the very first time. I find it a bit soulless to be honest. Its full of tourists just getting photos then moving on to the next photo op. I only ever go down there if i simply have to. I do love Beverly Hills, it's such an amazing area and has so much to offer but i stick to the streets either side of Rodeo Drive. In some ways, i feel embarrassed walking down Rodeo. Each to their own.",Skiingk
50,Mind blowing,"We walked along here on a sunny Saturday afternoon - it was mind blowing. We both enjoyed the people watching, my wife did some window shopping but didn't buy anything (thankfully), I was amazed by the car watching!

We were there in the evening and found parking on a side street one intersection away from the north end of Rodeo Drive. It was all lit up with twinkle lights and was a lovely sight to see. The shops were all very high end stores and although there were many people walking on the street, I didn’t notice many people actually inside the stores. We didn’t do any shopping, however it was a nice walk and lovely to see in the evening. If you are in the area, it is worth the walk for some photos and if you want to go on a designer shopping-spree, this would be the place to do it!",TheAverageTourist
50,Pretty Woman,"Pretty Woman. Walking down the street. Pretty Woman. I went to Rodeo Drive because of that movie and it did not disappoint. It’s really posh and beautiful in my opinion. You’ll see people who are dressed to the nines and people in sweats and jeans. Not everything is outrageously priced, which is good.",Abigail O
50,See how the Rich people shop,"Always wanted to visit Rodeo Drive to see where the “other half” shop It was absolutely fabulous to walk up and also to see the Beverly Wiltshire where Pretty Woman was made, also there was a lot of filming going on which was great Excellent experience",expatspain97
50,Girls shopping trip,"Lots of shops and great restaurants. Loved Chanel, shopping and eating at Fred's, exploring Chanel and LV",Karen G
50,A Winter Holiday Favorite,"We love to spend the holidays with family in Beverly Hills. There’s nothing better than to walk Rodeo drive on a crisp, cold night. What makes Rodeo drive special is that all of the stores decorate for the holidays. The stores are beautiful. The decorations are extravagant, everything you’d expect from Beverly Hills. Wilshire Blvd is usually dressed up with holiday lights too.Many have the impression you need to spend money to visit Beverly Hills, when in fact you do not. Parking garages offer two free hours of parking before 6 pm. The stores are mostly welcoming, but there are some stores that scare you away, like Harry Winston.Rodeo drive is home to some very expensive stores, billionaire clients, and pricey cars. It’s a scene worth an hour of exploration. There’s a lot to see, not only on Rodeo drive, but throughout downtown Beverly Hills. At the southern end of Rodeo drive is a mini pathway up into a courtyard. You’ll find a slew of stores like Vertu (home of the $22,000 mobile phone) and 208 Rodeo Cafe, a tourist haven! The city has tons of photo opportunities. I love to walk the famous Canon drive to see Spago.A few more blocks over and you will find Villa Blanca (Lisa Vanderpump’s restaurant; she’s a star from Housewives of Beverly Hills) and the best frozen yogurt in the world, Go Greek Yogurt, on Bedford.You might recognize the Beverly Wilshire, located on Wilshire Blvd at Rodeo, from the movie Pretty Woman.Drop by the visitor center on Santa Monica Blvd for a photo opportunity with the Beverly Hills sign and some cool memorabilia. Have fun!",Mikeywonderful
50,"Loved, Loved, Loved","Rodeo Drive was one of favourite moments of my Beverly Hills and Hollywood trip! Beautiful shops, fantastic experience and even better weather!

40,Peaceful,"I loved Rodeo drive, though its a small street, but they had a sweet weather in summer with the palm tress at the side of the rd. The boutiques were much more updated than the other branches in Orange County and Las Vegas.

Not many coffee shops like Dubai London Paris and Bangkok, mostly restaurants startbucks mini chocolatiers.",Bodourkhoory

30,Nothing special,"Rodeo Drive, what can I say. I'm not the shopping kind, but the shops are nice, but expensive, as you can expect.

40,Upscale shopping experience in Los Angeles,"A street in Beverlly Hills Carlifonia with several designer shops...I went to hunt an shop for fashion icons but did not see any... - maybe they have personal shoppers for real. The experience was however just like the movies.. sunny, not crowded and the shop owners let you browse",Dorcas Onyango
30,Spectacular at night,Visit Rodeo Drive at night to get the full impact. The street is very quite until mid-day - where as surrounding streets are busy with office workers. In the afternood you'll get lots of sightseeing tours - but at night (after dusk) when the lights on the palms come on that's when the drive looks its best. There are still plenty of shops open - that's if you get invited to walk in. I was told the shops on the drive are just there for brand positioning. Worth a trip to drive or walk down - don't expect to see celebs.,mark j
30,Smelled of richness,"We visited Rodeo Drive during a tour of Hollywood with The Anaheim Tour Company.Lovely clean and modern, palm tree lined street with lots of flash cars and just smelled of richness.

40,Fun to walk and shop!,Rodeo Drive; what more can I say? It is the iconic luxury shopping destination of the world. You see people from all over the world walking the street or driving their uber expensive cars through the neighborhood. Many shops have to buzz you in. If you're in LA it's worth a stop.,maxinedds

50,Classic,A walk down Rodeo Drive is a wonderful addition to any Hollywood holiday! The shops in the area can sometimes be closed for celebrities and the cats you might see driving around are some of the fanciest you will ever see! A great insight into the ‘hollywood lifestyle’,GraceOrchid
40,Pleasant Surprise,"Rodeo Drive was a stop included on my L.A. area tour. Wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised about Rodeo Drive.

40,World famous shopping street,"This street is comparable to NYC's 5th Avenue and Paris Champs d'Élysées.

30,Up market shopping,"Don't actually like it, I feel more like a voyeur when I come here but it all seems so familiar from all your favourite tv shows and movies. For most people, more a place for looking than buying with the expensive price tags in the up market stores.",RonWamberal
50,Fashion and fun!!!,"Omg! Amazing stores and amazing cars parked along the street! We had such a good time going into most of the stores and window shopping.

Quite busy during the day, with lots of gorgeous, lovely Beverly Hills people stepping out in their finest.",ChristinaMCGM
50,"Paradigm of high-end luxury shopping on the West Coast, a Californian version of NYC's Fifth/Madison Avenue","If you like shopping for luxury items, or window-shopping, you have to come experience this beautiful, expensive street. This is what you usually connect Beverly Hills with, besides the beautiful, expensive houses in the neighborhood. This is just like the Fifth Avenue, but in a Californian style. Actually you can find more high-end boutiques here than Fifth Avenue, in which sense it's more like Madison Avenue. Whichever designer brand you crave for, you'll likely find it here. And there are some brands that you can't find elsewhere, such as Bijan (You won't miss the Bugatti Vron parking in the store front.).Surprisingly you can park free here. Just find one of these public parking spots that offer up to 2 hours of free parking. There are several in the area.Dress fashionably when walking on this street, to look just 'normal', if you could. Otherwise, people will know that you're just a tourist here for window-shopping. Hah hah... actually nothing wrong with that.",Alex Lee

40,Great place to watch cars and fashions,"We visited late afternoon which gave us the chance to see the area in daylight and when it is lit up. We saw an amazing number of expensive sports cars. There are roadside tables and chairs where you can watch the people and cars. There are also some reasonably priced restaurants in the area where you can take an outside or window table. If you only have a short time available, I would suggest evening when everything is lit up.",rustygrecian

The Beverly Wilshire Hotel is located at the bottom of the street for your Pretty Woman moment. Take a table outside for tea and watch the world go by.Two Rodeo is more quirky and lovely bits of architecture, at the bottom there is an #onlyonrodeo frame that changes regularly. Time to get a selfie and mark the occasion.If the Beverly Wilshire is a bit pricy there is a Starbucks round the corner, coloured chairs and tables line the street, grab a coffee and take a seat.

As I strolled along Rodeo Drive, I was impressed with each store and people watching. Money, Money, Money! I enjoyed my Rodeo Drive experience, but bring lots of money if you plan to buy anything as it isn't cheap! It reminds me of NY's 5th Avenue or Chicago's Michigan Avenue - all high-end stores with great looks and high prices! Worth every moment as you will see things you wouldn't see else where, such as a belt for $80,000.00 (Eighty Thousand Dollars!). It is solid gold and encrusted with diamonds! It is still there, I didn't buy it, so don't worry!!!",Steven A

30,Stuck-up Rich people at their finest,"Like most things in LA, attractions or places are a ""one and done"" experience.

40,What a hoot! Great people watching . . . . For a short time.,"Let me preface my review with a bit about me. I am am older, well educated Brit. I have travelled widely and lived in Britain, Canada, the USA and the Cook Islands. . . . . . And I am well embued with the cynicism and dry sense of humour somewhat typical of my age and cultural background.A visit to Rodeo Drive was highly entertaining, and mildly distressing -- not for the stores, I can't afford them and have no interest -- but to watch the people.The middle age man with the very young, very shapely woman with looong legs, a tiny shirt and incredibly high platform shoes walking across the road to his Porsche. The huge numbers of people dressed to the nines strutting the streets -- just to be seen. The conspicuous displays of wealth . . . . As if that had some real meaning. I found it both very amusing and very sad at the same time.For me, wealth would buy me amazing experiences, a trip to Antarctica, a ride on the Trans Siberian Railway, a visit to a Monastry in Tibet . . . . . Not expensive clothes or fancy cars . . .. But then, I grew up in a different time and place.So, Rodeo Drive is well worth a visit if only to see ""how the other half live"" through the lens of your own life experiences.",kiaorana5

50,People Watching on Rodeo!,"Rodeo Drive has obviously been well-known and famous for many, many years, but since 1990, made even more so due to a certain Mr Gere and a Miss Roberts when making the film ‘Pretty Woman’. So, during our coach tour in and around the USA, we were driven down Rodeo Drive as part of the tour, and on hearing from the Tour Director that we had the afternoon free when we got back to our Hotel; Well that was all we needed to hear for the start of our afternoon, as both my wife and myself are huge Julia Roberts fans! We requested could we be dropped off here and we would make our own way back to the Hotel later, as we wished to walk this famous street. Boy, did we make the most of it? No, we could not afford anything in the shops and boutiques on this street, as items procured in these places are ‘Very Expensive!’, (for those who remember the film), but we could people-watch and vehicle-watch, which we did for most of the afternoon! Along Rodeo Drive, there are tables and chairs situated at various intervals that allow you to just sit and do exactly that. There were Tourists, the same as my wife and I, but interspersed in the mix were people dressed in really expensive designer gear, with bling and jewellery to match; there were Rolls-Royces, Lamborghini’s, Ferraris, Corvettes, Bentleys and many other vehicles that one could only dream about. We just sat there soaking it all up as that would probably be the closest we will ever come to that kind of lifestyle. To top it off, we walked to the end of Rodeo & Wilshire, crossed the road and actually went in to the foyer/lobby of the ‘Beverley Wilshire Hotel’; Wow, that was nice. We turned a few heads as I don’t think we were dressed correctly, but the Concierge was very nice to us and let us take a couple of photographs; it really made our day!",IanJay

50,World class shopping,"Who hasn't heard of Rodeo Drive? It is known as a world class shopping destination and for celebrity sightings. I recommend dining just off of Rodeo Drive on Dayton Way the the Grill on the Alley. A wonderful place to eat as many celebrities can attest. While shopping on Rodeo be sure and drop by Bijan. It is probably the oldest store on the famous street which got it'd commercial jump start by the Late Fred Hayman and his famous store, Georgio's. Bijan opened not long afterwards and has been in operation serving famous clients all over the world (including many Presidents, Kings and athletes. The Middle Weight boxing Champion, GGG wears Bijan trunks!! There are stores for every taste and dining to match. Enjoy!!",lordsnowden1961

Driving in our rental Ford Explorer, we were surrounded by Maseratis, Bentleys and Rolls Royces...The high end shops and boutiques were just amazing.

50,To shop or not to shop,We decided to walk around Rodeo Drive at night to protect ourselves from shopping too much (just teasing).

Most people there are tourists taking photographs and you can spot a local a mile away as they are coated in designer wear that us mere mortals have never heard of. However it is chilled out and nobody looks down their nose at you because you are simply enjoying the facilities. My wife got excited when we saw the Pretty Woman hotel.

40,Looking into the Hollywood Goldfish Bowl,Pretty Woman says it all! This is one of those places where a book is judged solely by its cover. Despite owning a pair of Prada heels I clearly belong on the wrong side of the velvet rope!It is an entertaining foray into unfettered capitalism and should certainly be included on a tour of LA.,chilli_bom_bom
50,Beautiful place with top shops,"It was a pleasure to walk around. Beautiful place, top shops, flowers and art.Shops are obviously very expensive but you can just walk around and enjoy the scenery.",Laurence K
30,The most famous street in Los Angeles Beverly Hills,This is mostly frequented by tourists. Rodeo isn't what it used to be some years ago. This time we were wandering down Rodeo & noticed a bright yellow Rolls Royce complete with bright yellow upholstery & a number plate with BIJANAlso the Parking Meter is Bright Yellow withBijan painted on it. This of course is outside of the BIJAN Store. The prettiest part is the end nearest Wiltshire BlvdIt has been built to look like an old Italian street. It is quite beautiful,Evelynne G
50,Wow,"Golden Triangle you all! This is Beverly Hills. Just look don't touch! Unless for this time. Are u feeling like Pretty Woman? Even if u r a man? Not my prob, cutie! Into a shop? Maybe I have to take off my shoes. No! Jocking. Armani, Dior, Vuitton, etc. all are dazzling yr eyes. Wanna buy smthg? Maybe next century or when I will become Johnny Depp. And I'll do! You can be sure. C u soon Rodeo. For all. Don't loose it. Walk and walk. Take pics. You are starring dear! You are on air.",Gian Luca V
40,Worth a drive,"As historic and iconic as this drive is, it is worth a drive down the street, if no other reason to see the amazing cars driving through this stretch, this is definitely a different clientele.",hottoddy88
50,As fabulous as you would expect,"This was our first time visiting Rodeo Drive and it was every bit as glamorous as I imagined. We didn't buy anything, though we shopped on adjacent streets, but the window shopping was just as fun! This is a must see, just to be able to say you have been.",Familyof3&2crazydogs
50,The Glamour of the West Coast,Just strolling the streets and window shopping is eye candy for those who love to see beautiful things and beautiful people. Hope go end stores cater to those in the know. You may even see a movie star or two shopping or dining.,Sandra R
40,How You Can Enjoy How The Other Half Lives--without going broke.,"In it's flashy history Rodeo Drive has gone from Rich Man's (and Woman's ) Delight to Rub Shoulders with the Rich and Famous (and the Famous for the time Being)Stroll that Boulevard and window shop--and watch the privileged spend big.You can survive with your wallet (and credit cards) intact. The Rodeo Triangle works for those who follow a few simple rules. You can eat--try Nat' n Al's Deli--and you might bump into Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner who use it as their local ""kaff."" Spago and Is Pastaio are nice and reasonable for lunch. For dinner I prefer walking across Wilshire Boulevard to Chin Chin on Beverly Drive. Good food at manageable prices. And check out the marvelous Paley Center for Media. Well worth a visit and not likely to set you back a small fortune.You might spot Johnny Depp spending some of his 150,000 a year allowance on wines. But it's a great spot for ogling. Make sure you wear your eclipse glasses to avoid being too dazzled by the local shoppers!",ivordavisbeatlescom
40,Shopping or Browsing,Great if you like high end shopping for looking at the stuff the ultra rich like to buy. I saw more Bentley and Rolls Royce here in an hour than my entire live before that. You can include this on a guided tour but walking around yourself is probably best.,tat52015
40,Good if you want to shop the big luxury brands.,"All luxury brands are conveniently located close to each other. Not the most idillic shopping area, but it has all you need.",WendyCo84
50,Rodeo Drive - A must see!,We walked from our hotel and did a nice walk around Rodeo drive. It was really spectacular and nice to see!,TaniaCraig
10,Pretentious,"Its fun for people watching - we stopped here for 20 minutes on a tour ! Sat outside one of the shops and watched one of the ""staff"" come out with handbag held in a special gloved hand so as not to taint the leather to show a customer with more money than sense how wonderful the colour of the bag looked in daylight - apparently the bag would ""elevate her wardrobe"" - it's a grey handbag love ! - made me want to vomit to be honest",Nikki F
50,The best place to shop in LA,"The brands seem to our way more here than they do in their European stores. It does cost a bit more for Europeans, due to import duty and the strong dollar, but there is more choice. I got a great tracksuit and tshirt in D&G that I hadn't seen in Europe. Paid $2,500 all in, but they tailored the tracksuit and delivered it to my hotel the same day. Great service. Great street. Convenient for lunch at the Beverley Wilshire afterwards.",Nick M
40,dreams do come true,"I have always wanted to visit Rodeo Drive. on our visit to California I got to go. and I visited several other wonderful places close to this. The Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood walk of fame. and so much more. this is all a mjust see if you are in California.",C R
50,Shopping,Well i don't have to write so much as everyone knows what Rodeo Drive is famous for. As you can see from my photos the kind of luxury you can buy. Great shopping place with nice restaurants.. lots of tourists window shopping😁😁,Globetrotting C
50,Enjoyable walk,Perfect place for window shopping and more if you have budgeted for it.Many nice cafés and restaurants around too.,JEV23
40,"A must see, but not to shop!","You cannot come to LA without visiting Rodeo Drive, since you will recognize this street with its very high end retail stores from numerous movies (ie Pretty Woman). Unless you have a lot of money to spend, you will likely just walk down the street and enjoy the people watching. Even better to watch are the very high end sports cars that drive up to the stores and get valet parking! Good news is they have added tables and chairs along the street for pedestrians to use, and there is also nice music that plays from the speakers in the palm trees lining the street. There is a Starbucks too if you need a cold or hot drink!",Beach4ever4me
50,Window shopping,Always love Rodeo. Can't afford Rodeo. Very fun to walk and enjoy a beautiful day. Interesting fashion.,Lisa S
50,Like in the movies,"A must to visit road when you are around. Clean, picturesque, very elegant. You can spot this scene on movies very often.",pengemex
40,NICE STROLL ON A SUNNY DAY,"If you are in Beverly Hills, park in one of the many public parking buildings ( free for first two hours ) and do a promenade around Rodeo drive, see the fashion brands displayed and maybe have a coffee or ice cream while you enjoy the atmosphere, the beautiful people and cars, and then move on to your next planned attraction.",Easybob2014
40,Worth a visit,"Stopped off here during our hop on/hop off ride on the Starline bus. Just what you'd expect from Beverly Hills, packed with designer shops and beautifully maintained streets.",HelenBezzo

30,Crazy expensive,Walked along the street which is absolutely beautiful but didn't dare go into any stores as I didn't feel like I'd be welcomed. Couldn't afford anything anyways and the sales people looked snotty! Glad I got to see it but I'll stick with Target!,Sheri G
40,Enlightening,Great place to people watch. You have your homeless person on the street corner and women dressed like they are attending a premiere (@11am) all walking down the street together. Not shopping for your average joe but interesting to see how the other half lives. Nice unique shops are scattered among the very high and not so high end retail stores. From breakfast(or lunch) @ Tiffany's to Starbucks all within a few blocks. :),Scm77
40,Iconic street with high end shops,Had a lovely wander round Rodeo Drive - although you will need deep pockets if you want to do more than window shop! Definitely worth a visit during a trip to LA,Amanda4471
20,Rude people,"I know it's an exclusive place but was made to feel like I shouldn't be there.Went into Tiffany's to buy eldest daughter something for finishing her GCSE's and waited ages to be spoken to, to then be treated in a very rude manner. Needless to say didn't buy anything - will go to store in London instead 😡",Andrea P
50,Vacation,Such a beautiful street. At night its all light up. Stores are high end. Parking was easy cause you have street parking and parking garage.,Chandanie S

10,A Complete Nightmare,"The traffic is absolutely horrible in this area. People do not follow traffic laws, drivers are rude, bumper to bumper traffic and unnecessary honking. I would NEVER go to this area again. Terrible experience.",60seattle
50,Just beautiful!!!!,Great place to feel like a star! Grab lunch and shop a little! Definitely lives up to the expectation!,Love2TravelKK
50,Rodeo Drive ~ A Unique Scene,"Walking Rodeo Drive is a Bucket List item for many. I have walked it every time I've visited LA ~ not to check a box ~ but because it's a unique scene. It's a place full of possibiIities where I cannot predict what may come my way, by chance. Yes I like the Element of Surprise.My favorite people-watching site is from the Patio @ The Blvd.••••••••••From the comments about Rodeo Drive not meeting expectations ~ I wonder what their preconceived ideas were, & the source of their impressions?Some sounded intimidated &/or resentful of the wealth ~ with 1,000 attractions to choose from, & limited time, Why did they choose Rodeo Drive?••••••••••",ChanEvan
40,Surprisingly nice,"Went as part of a tour but would have tried to go even without this tour. Really just wanted to go bc of being in the area and curious to see what it was like (Pretty Woman and all). Was actually really nice! Interesting architecture, nice art galleries, clean, and of course an amazing number of designer shops. Could have easily spent a couple of hours there, esp if you stop at Beverly Hilton for a glass of wine at the bar.",Jane D
40,This place is hilarious!,"What a pretentious, silly place this is, but so fun to drive through! I'm not sure that stopping and wandering would be worthwhile and the shops with ridiculously overpriced stock hold no interest for me, but a drive through is fun enough for us to go around the block a couple of times to people and car watch.We actually came from the OTHER end of Rodeo Drive, which is a decidedly ordinary looking suburban area. But when you get to the 'fancy' end, it's a whole other world. I can't imagine that shopping there would be fabulous for the locals with all the gawkers (like us), but I'm sure that there's valet parking there for people in the know.The ugly yellow and black Bugatti in another reviewers photos was there when we were there a few weeks ago, so either it may be parked there regularly, or we visited at the same time, because I can't imagine that there are too many bright yellow and black bumble bee Bugattis around!If you're in the area, drive through for sure, it's certainly an interesting drive!",Dromomaniac
20,Not Impressed,All hyped up about Rodeo Drive but we found it to be swamped with tourists and a nightmare to find parking! Suggest to drive by for a sightseeing visit in a convertible but leave the tourists walk the pavement and shops.,Changjo88
50,I felt like Julia Roberts,Would you like to feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty woman?Walk through Rodeo Drive means that. All the most famous and expensive brands in the whole world in one street. Life of luxury and extravagance.,Lilian_dreis
40,Medical visit,"It's pretty, expensive, exciting atmosphere. Great to people watch. If you are looking to see all the expensive brand names, this is the place.",Connie T
20,Who's got the biggest...,Waste of time! Full of shops which have disappeared up their own... Streets are filled with boy racers who zoom around in cars which they/their parents have paid to have pimped to the max. Would pop in to say I've seen/done it but Santa Monica is much nicer than this soulless place.,Hudson_lufc
50,Glamour everywhere,It is a must do if you go to Los Angeles. So many nice and expensive places but you must walked these streets.,lbernad
40,Take a Walk on the Extravagant Side,Rodeo Drive is an American Classic Street I say this because all the top name extravagant stores are there along with tourists from all over the world. There are fancy car cruising the streets and glittery looking stores lining both sides. We ventured into a few stores but soon found we were way over our head in the cost of things. There are places to sit and people watch and there are parking lots close by. Several restaurants offer outdoor seating at a reasonable price. Most menus are outside with prices. There are ice cream type shops close by as well.,johnjN8052KK
40,Great,Spent a few hours walking around in and out of the nice expensive stores. Then a few more hours sipping beer outside people watching my daughter actually spotted Justin Bieber leaving a hotel car park in his little white Mercedes SUV. So a great place to visit and hope you see some real stars,Craig G
50,Beverly Hills!💛🇺🇸,"Sto til forventningene dette! Dyre butikker som vi bare så inn i! Ellers spennende å se rundt! Noen venner møtte også på selveste Kim Kardashian når hun filmet en episode av the Kardashians. Så kanskje vi alle ender opp i bakgrunnen. De gikk og filmet rundt i Rodeo drive når vi var der så hehe😊 Ellers så fant vi Chipotle å spise der noe som er til å annbefale på høyt nivå men ikke for de minste!😊Wow! That was as we expected! Beautiful and extremely expensive! We only had a look inside the stores. Some friends of me meet Kim Kardashian as she was filming a new episode of the Kardashians so maybe we all end up in the Background of a new episode in the fault. Other than that beautiful streets worth a visit! We found Chipotle ( a place to eat, cheap and good) really can reccomend this! (But not for the little ones) 😊🇺🇸",Anne Folstad
40,Beautiful,We visited as part of a bus tour so didn't stay for too long although I couldn't have afforded to stay! Very expensive shopping street but very beautiful. Worth a walk along,Chiggins91
40,Worth the visit because of what it is,I don't believe you can be a tourist visiting L.A. and not visit Rodeo Drive. We managed to find two hour free parking on a side street about four blocks away from the drive and had plenty of time to walk down the drive. We weren't looking to shop but just to walk the strip.,ljd4
50,Quick drive by,Another necessary trip on a tour of Los Angeles. It is worth it just to see the Bugatti parked out front. No need to linger or shop.,jason s

30,California Trip Stop,Stopped here on a city tour. Yes it has a allure to it. We didn't go into any shops figured why bother we can't afford it anyway. Ha.

30,Fun to visit but hard to take seriously,Beverly Hills is basically just for tourists wanting to get a glimpse of how the other 1% live. The streets are lined with designer brands which 99% of visitors can't afford and the streets filled with sports cars.It's fun to visit but slightly grotesque at the same time.,Mike
50,Lovely!,"Rodeo Drive is a fun place to visit and a beautiful street to stroll while admiring the beauty around. Oh.. get an outside table at The Blvd restaurant right there on Wilshire Boulevard /Rodeo Drive, it is a great place to go for people watching. We had both lunch and dinner there, nice!The shopping street is full of fabulous shops and the landscaping is nice too, you even enjoy music while walking down the street as they have speakers mounted on palm trees, I found that a touch of class!Walking on Rodeo Drive is a must in Beverly Hills, so have your camera fully charged as you'll be taking pics and….expect many of tourists doing the same too ;-). Enjoy Beverly Hills!",Stylish001f
30,Not what I was expecting,"Have to say, Dubai has been raising my expectations for everyplace that I visit, and then I realize that I am completely spoilt here. I was expecting glamour, style and fun at the Rodeo Drive, just as in the movies, but the place is a bit on the drab side. Yes, the brands are there, but they are also in every mall in Dubai now. And I guess my expectations were higher than what it really is.",ByteSizeLife

40,So much money,"On a recent trip to California I had to see what all the fuss was about for Rodeo Drive. Wow everything was super fancy, super expensive and very glamorous. I love to shop but I must admit I never heard of some of the stores. Of course there was Tiffany's, Gucci, Prada and all the ones I expected to see.

Its interesting to see the hotel from Pretty woman and browse some stores, but overall it made me kind of queasy. If I only had $2800 for a pair of those Jimmy Choo shoes...I would give the cash to the kids at St Jude. Just saying. Its so narcissistic it hurts.The area is clean and kept vagrant free, parking is available in paid close by lots and its great for some photos...also a random tour bus rolls thru, but thats it. Its also MUCH smaller an area than you imagine.",Michelle_Haley

It even had a guess shop with what I call high street prices. It was a truly lovely experience one that I would happily repeat. Highly recommend if you are visiting Beverly Hills you can't leave without a peak.",Marlaina C

50,Feel good Street,"Say no more, right it is a feel good street, the art galleries at the end of the street was my favourite and my wife's was the clothing stores, naturally. Many restaurants spread around side streets of the Rodeo drive, most fine dinning or priced for fine dinning, very nice. Check our all the side streets that are connecting to the Rodeo Drive, all has nice boutiques, restaurants and specialty stores.

40,Come early to take pix!,"We came early before the shops opened to take pix. We parked in the Valet parking structure on Dayton St. First 2 hours is free.If you park here, the elevator in the parking garage let's you off right on ""Via Rodeo"".Take a pix under the infamous street signs: ""Via Rodeo"" and ""N. Rodeo Drive"". We came b4 the crowds and our pix turned out great (no photo bombers!).Afterwards, we walked down Rodeo drive all the way to Santa Monica Blvd. And hit a few shops on the way. Purchased a Coach clutch for 50% off... And they engraved my initials on the leather tag for free! Score!Took a right on Santa Monica Blvd. To the Beverly Hills visitors center to take pix under the BH sign. Made our way to Wilshire Blvd. To take pix at ""Pretty Woman's"" hotel (The Four Seasons).Found a cute macaroon place (Lette Macarons) 5 minutes away... Worth the walk.",Maria T

40,Everything America is known bad about,If you rent a car you got to see this area. You can do a self tour of Beverly Hills and end up on Rodeo Dr. We started the day at the Reagan library. Went out of town to the east and came back in on the coast side and went through the hills through Beverly Hills and down rodeo drive. A nice scenic day. Rodeo drive was all it is hyped up to be. Fancy stores that the average person would have no reason to go into. Fancy cars everywhere that are a dime a dozen in LA. Taxpayers are probably paying for most as business deductions. But IIf touring LA you have to see it. Glad we did from a car. Be aware that drivers I. lA are incredibly bad drivers and are very wasteful of gasoline. Probably why the rest of the country suffers with pollution. But fit this iconic drive into your visit to make it complete as why we are considered rudely rich,Scott T

So I recommend parking for an hour at a free Beverly Hills city lot and window shopping your way down the street so you can check it off your bucket list. But if you are not a shopper, skip it.",in0r
20,These people think they're better than everyone else,Went for a drive on Rodeo Dr and it was a nice drive because of the palm trees and the high end stores.

40,Fun Experience,"It was nice to walk along this iconic street that has been seen countless times in movied. My sons were enjoying watching the exotic high end cars. While I could afford to shop here if u truly wanted, I am far too practical. This was strictly for the experience.",ATXGirlie
20,Pretty average,This is another gimmick of a place full of rich fake people.. full of themselves.. if u r coming here to see movie stars forget it .. so when u get on those bs star sighting tours that go through there that can't stop u are throwing your money away.. if u come here better off getting a uber from your hotel get dropped off on the actual road and take your time walking around.. but trust me u won't see no movie stars,unclechownza
50,If High End Fashion is your thing...,If you are looking to purchase (or just looking) for designer clothing and accessories then Rodeo Drive has it all bundled into one street.

10,Terrible Customer Service,"The folks at this location is absentee. I purchased a set of headphones from them over the phone (since their online process declined my purchase for no apparent reason) and the order has been sitting in their store for last 2 days (weekday). They weren't absent when it came to running my credit card for the purchase! UPS tracking # shows that it hasn't even been picked up yet. I called over 30x on a Friday between 11am - 2pm and no one picks up. WTF? Is this how to run a business? No wonder brick and mortar stores are going out of business. It's a simple task: put the product in a box, call UPS for a pick-up, make sure it's picked up. The package needs to travel 40 miles from your store. It shouldn't be this tough....BUT obviously it is for these folks. I'm doing by best to contact them to CANCEL the order but no one is there to pick up. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE! THIS BRAND DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR MONEY.",Binh T
50,Only wishful window shopping unless you have money to burn,"The Rodeo Drive area was MUCH smaller than I expected it to be! You really can cover Rodeo Drive in a couple of hours or less. It is literally all of the biggest names in fashion side by side and very condensed. I DID fall prey to a gorgeous pale pink Miu Miu purse for a mere $2,400. Miu Miu is a sister store of Prada. The clothing in those big name stores did not excite me and I WOULD have paid if I had seen something I like. I feel like you could really skip this area unless you want to brag about a great fashion accessory or clothing piece you purchased from ""Rodeo Drive"". I also stopped into Kyle's clothes store which is owned by Kyle Richards (one of the cast members on Bravo's Real Housewives of Beverly Hills) but did not see anything I liked and trust me I was trying to like something in there just to brag about it.The people in my life are intellectuals and couldn't care less about fancy things so the only person I impressed was myself. There is a neighborhood not far from this area which has stores with fashionable clothes for much less, I apologize that I don't have the specific crossroads to give you.",TravelJunkie
30,Upmarket shopfronts that is more about context than content.,"I suppose every upmarket fashion label wants to have Rodeo Drive on their address list but, in all honesty, its just a series of shop fronts with very little that the average person would (or could) purchase.

50,A nice stroll,"Excellent place for a stroll to window shop and people watch. You don't need to buy anything if you don't want to, but if you want all the high name stores are there for your every wish... not hardly any American made cars in the area! A must see!",Eurootto
50,Lifestyles of the rich and famous,"A wonderful place to basque on shopping with some of the heavy weight fashion designers. It's a great place to admire and if you have money spend on yourself, all the better. If you into celebs you might spot one. They have fancy restaurants but it's on the pricey side. You can still have a great time just window shopping and taking pics. A must visit for tourists",remberto p

10,Over-rated,"I think this is the street where all the designer outlets are said to be patronised by film stars. Well, perhaps so.

Obscene really but I suppose if you can shop on rodeo that's probably just small change.

50,Everything you would expect,"If you come to Los Angeles then Rodeo Drive is a must I think.Yes it is seriously OTT but that is exactly what it is supposed to be and is nice to see in my opinion.Coming from London, best way to describe Rodeo Drive is Bond Street with Palm Trees and sun shine.Has all the top stores of the world and again, coming from London...you won't find it any more expensive than anywhere else along with a few exclusives to the street which is always great.If you visit LA then I think you come to see a movie star life style and this place pretty much sums it up.If you come to be bitter about how the other half live...then avoid this street as you will have way too much to be bitter about.",Mo M

Most of the shops are quiet and if you cant afford the street you will feel uncomfortable going into a shop. The shops really only have a small amount of product in them and i found it interesting that the shops cover the whole outfit so have racks with a few ready made outfits. Other shops are not open as only open by appointment, and some are not open at all but are hidden by clever advertising so you dont notice as much. The street is nice and clean but there are still a few hawkers trying to sell you things. I didnt see any celebrity when i went but i would image that you could see them there.

40,"Fancy schmancy pricey shops, that's all this is","Ah! Rodeo Drive, famous for ""A-listers"", movie stars and wannabees to walk, shop and be recognized. Made infamous for snobbery in Pretty Woman! Yes, in the land of sunshine, convertibles and other pricey cars parade drivers and passengers to be seen. Yes, it has expensive, exclusive shops and eateries. The good thing is this is America and if you've got money to blow or show, you could come here and do it. Otherwise, white slacks, sun hats, whte shirts, fancy jeans and fancy gowns - the latest fashionfrom everywhere could be seen here. Some shops are more welcoming than others! And nowadays, there is a lot more respect for Asian shoppers!",EuForia_01
50,Great place to Visit,"I have been to Rodeo Drive over 20 times over the years for walking around and business. The core shops are very expensive, so shopping is not why I was there. Though my wife had her hair done by Jose Eber' This is a great place for celebrity viewing. I have seen Richard Gere in a pharmacy, Diane Keaton walking down the sidewalk and singer Lennie Kravitz at Tiffanys. That was on one day. I have seen others over the years.",Gumshoe2000
40,Like stepping into another world,we just drove through this area. My teenage son wanted to see some fancy cars and we were not disappointed. We saw all the major sports cars including a Bugatti and Rolls Royce.We did not get out to shop but be aware there are some one way roads so pay attention while driving.,Moustacio D

40,Loved just wandering around,We came here for lunch & a wander but predominately to people watch. The street itself is beautiful & very clean with nice gardens. All the stores are amazing & very impressive. Obviously this is not a place for shopping on a budget but it is great for a look around & to see all the luxury cars cruising the streets. We couldn't find a cafe on Rodeo Drive itself but managed to find something suitable several blocks away. I loved this area & am happy to say that I managed to but myself a bag & watch at the Guess store for a very reasonable price.,AWTYblogger

50,Window Shopping,"It's a good way to spend an hour or two. Parking was easy at the meter. I have to say we stopped here after hiking the sign and the kids looked like hot messes but everyone was still very friendly and pleasant at the stores we went it. And clearly we weren't going to buy anything. The stores are not really a big deal it's more that's its Rodeo drive. I was lucky enough that my kids was running around like crazy borderline embarrassing by not listening, he happened to run to the top floor of Burberry and we happened to seem someone famous at the Louie Vuitton store. Pretty cool. And yes we saw some really fancy cars that I couldn't even tell you what they were.",stryteller
50,"While I only breezed through Rodeo, I enjoyed the lovely scenery: well-appointed stores and restaurants",It's a shame that I didn't have enough time on my trip to walk through the center of town and explore the different boutiques and restaurants.

30,"Nice walk along an iconic street, not for me.","while over in LA it would have been a shame not to have gone to Rodeo Drive so we took the car and dove down it, parked up and went for a walk. Have to say the parking is good, anyway this was not really for me. The place was very clean and well kept (as you would expect) and pretty. Its a nice walk with a few good places to stop for a coffee. Not a place i would go back to personally, I am sure its great if you are into Retail Therapy.",NHunter_33
30,Pretty walk past shops,"It's iconic, but let's face it, you aren't really going to shop here. We enjoyed strolling down the street and back, but there is not much to do unless you want to spend thousands of dollars on overpriced apparel and accessories.",Deanna9

30,Take a Quick Walk Down the Street - Snap a Photo or Two and Take Off,"Rodeo Drive is a shopping district and nothing more. There are very expensive stores filled mostly with people that have no intention of buying anything. Take a walk down the street, get your photo snapped in front of the Rodeo Drive sign and then go somewhere else that has better sights and does not cost a fortune.",JonBr2014
40,Interesting shops,"It is a well kept street with lots of tourist. The shops are fabulous but many have security guards so not sure if we would allowed to enter. Not even sure if anyone actually buys anything as everything is so expensive. But we had to do the ""Pretty Woman"" walk.",Karen H

30,Don't expect to see a celebrity,"Our tour allegedly saw the left elbow of David Beckham hanging out of his car--- this is the kind of hype that drags people down to a small strip of extremely high end stores called rodeo drive.

50,"Very Expensive, yet very cool place to visit","Even if you can't afford to buy anything from any of the stores it is still cool to just drive, or walk down this street to view everything.

(One store was closed off while someone shopped with their limo parked outside!)Lovely to walk around and take pictures of the stores and the people...we even went into to Wilshire Boulevard Hotel to take pics and call an Uber!Apart from the stores there are a few cafes to have coffee and people watch.

40,The face of Beverly Hills,I saw where the 1% get to shop and I liked it. The stores had beautiful displays and exquisite items for sale. There were not a lot of foot traffic the 3 days I was there but there were a lot of fancy cars cruising by. You have to be careful when you get to Wilshire because the Ferraris like to show what they can do. LA could probably repair their other roads if they just gave tickets on that one road.,ktcain50
50,Great walk and people watching,"Where else would you see three security guards escort 6 women with full bags in each hand to their chauffeur driven car.One has to be quick to see that there is public parking under the stores, and it is almost always full.In addition to the scene, the people and the stores, there are great and famous restaurants, to enjoy as a break from shopping and people watching.",Peter C

50,I guess you have to see it,"There is so much to do in LA, so many places to see-- manmade.... and of natural beauty.

40,Lovely Shopping Street With Overpriced Designer Stores,"This is something I feel a person should visit once since it's an iconic landmark if in Los Angeles. Lovely landscaped, palm tree lined street with designer stores not many can afford. Rolex, Tiffany, Versace, etc. Stores were really not filled with many people, but rather a lot of tourists taking photos and tour buses going up and down the street. But it was pretty and my son enjoyed walking around.",DL9022
50,Atmosphere was awesome,Shopping was fun an such great scenery. People were helpful an friendly. We were told people were not friendly an not helpful if you didn't appear to be worth millions.

50,It is exactly what you expect,"The heart of glamour and wealth in America, right? Lamborghinis, ferraris, bentleys everywhere!

Loved walking past the big designer stores like channel. Did make a small purchase at guess which was more in my price range. Walk the full length and you will come to a little cobbled area with some steps. At Christmas time the decorations are great.

30,Boutiques or wannabe Boutiques bonanza...but that's it,"People in this area of L.A. (Beverly Hills or W. Hollywood) travel by cars only, therefore is really hard to find people on the streets walking, as I was. On the way back to the hotel the taxi driver loughed hilariously at me, asking if I went for the whole distance by foot on the way to Rodeo Drive. OK, so this is an area for mid to expensive shopping, mostly clothing. Who need this experience is at the right spot. I have expected a blend of cuisines and luxury, maybe luxury cars as well...nothing alike. BTW, the cars are 85% black or silver (maybe more).",Luci D

It is, however, a good experience just to walk down the street so you can say that you have... and admire the fancy cars and look for famous people. We didn't see any movie stars, but did snap lots of photos of famous store fronts.",Macon08

40,High end,Have to do it once but the hype is greater than the reality. The residential section has large homes with manicured lawns and landscaping. The retail section has every high end world class store. And serious sports cars cruise the strip. Most people can't shop here but it's worth a drive through.,Tapin7
30,Great to See Expensive Things Most Can't Buy,It's fun to look at the stores and dream and check out the famous buildings nearby. Not to mention all of the expensive cars you'll likely see during your time there.

The usual famous and expensive shops, average buildings, clean and large pavements ideal for a stroll, you may find colorful luxury Bugatti or Porsche cars.

We say Tygas gold Mercedes drive past, and a three million dollar Bugatti parked in front of one of the boutiques.Foreign tourists and a handful of over the top wealthy locals fill the sidewalks. All the expected shops, Chanel, Tiffany, Gucci, etc.Stop and get a coffee and watch the show. LA at its finest, all shiny and showy and wanting to be gazed upon!",Alicia67

If you aren't buying try not to take much of the salespeoples time, they work on commission often.

I enjoyed Fred Hayman (Orig called Georgio Bev Hills until they sold the rights to that name to a perfume company), Lalique, and just around the corner the Barneys...I walked out with some snazzy stuff. Please don't wear a T Shirt and shorts! Be cool. Dining in the area is quite expensive and very trendy but not fulfilling food. Perhaps you want to eat before or after. We had a nice little nosh in a cafe on Upper Rodeo. Note I said little, the bill was the only thing big about it. But I live in NYC do I am a bit more used to that.",TravlerRich
10,mehh,"It's still amazing to me that a world class city like LA has this make-shift street with strip-mall-like buildings of no architectural interest as their prime luxury shopping street. Yes, you have all the brands that increasing amounts of people now want, but the street has no atmosphere nor any distinction.

If you are in LA it is one of those ""must do's"" but you will probably be let down. Yes all of the extremely high end stores are there, but this isn't the place for your average person to go shopping.

The selection of high end shops is similar to areas of Paris, St Moritz Biarritz etc. I guess rich people who move from place to place want to feel they are at home! The best part was the Galerie Michael. The representative who showed us around was charming and interesting to talk with about the art works on display.",Lavarcham

Just in a three block distance you can go complete mayhem on shopping then cool down and have a bite and a drink on Beverly Drive.

50,Best of the best shopping,"Rodeo is a must do if you're in Bev Hills. All of the high end stores (most very spacious) on one street, and the best of the best shopping/browsing. Tons of amazing vehicles as part of your sightseeing. I like cars but don't consider myself obsessed with them although that changed - I was drooling at the Bentleys, Maseratis, Rolls etc. Some cute and more affordable shops sprinkled in the general areas too/side streets. I wouldn't consider this my favorite area to eat in and think there are better places on N Canon. I have to put a plug in for Saint Laurent on Rodeo (women's store) and Malcolm who helped me get a to die for bag in September. He was welcoming, friendly and helpful. I didn't have much time so he worked quickly. I plan on working directly with him for any future purchases. As a side note for all of the handbag lovers out there, Saint Laurent's tote bag is probably the least expensive bag in its class, comes with a wristlet and is available in about 12 fun colors. There are not many SL stores around. If there is not one in your state, have it shipped and pay zero tax.",Dlbos
40,What a film set!,"Visited 930am on a Saturday, weirdly quiet but can't be faulted as the best of Beverley Hills. High end stores but not brash and imposing. Loved the Tiffany and Porsche stores just for the experience, although did spend a number of dollars in Tiffany - Co!",Jon Y

30,Not much Atmosphere,"How can you not go to Rodeo Drive if you're in Beverly Hills?Other high-end shopping areas in the USA have a more energetic and posh vibe than you'll find on Rodeo Drive. The area is fairly quiet and if you walk into a store wearing shorts and a tank top you will probably get some of the same looks Julia Roberts received in ""Pretty Woman"".I bought a couple of things, and there is no doubt that you will nice items, but of course at the price tag you'd expect!

30,"Clean neat area, but beware","If you are adamant about seeing this, it may be worth checking out, the next street over will make you feel like more of a person but Rodeo Drive shopping will make you feel like squalor. I assume they can identify people with money and everyone else is a slum. I ignored the pity looks and the staring, but I am sure it is difficult for some to even walk through. I was never greeted at the door or a store that I went into look around and NEVER approached by a sales person with a kind word or smile. They only stared and whispered. Seriously! Maybe they felt like tourist just come to look like they are a bunch of freak shows but maybe they shouldn't stand around and look like freaks.",missouritravel5

20,A few blocks of overpriced shopping,"So as I walked this street I struggled to see why anyone really cares about it. I am not a shopper that is for certain, but as I passed the windows on my early morning exercise walk, I saw the undoubtedly very expensive clothes and I was reminded of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" - I am just waiting for a kid to yell out that most of the stuff is tacky or plain and certainly overpriced. So if you are into shopping you will go here no matter what I say or anyone else says. If you are not into shopping it is not worth it - skip it. I certainly have no desire to return.",ADKtraveller

Its BEAUTIFUL, peaceful and so clean you could probably eat off the street. Fun place to walk and just take in all shops (if you are into that) and if lucky, maybe purchase something. The sales person at every store I went to (and the list is long) were very pleasant, helpful, and reached out to the customer even if you didn't buy anything, they always asked and you KNOW they KNOW we are tourists.

50,Fun to dream about being rich (and to be able to afford these stores),"Even though we are not from a wealthy, famous, celebrity family, every store (employee's) treated us nicely. It was fun to go in and ""browse"", and dream, at these super high end stores.",KathleenPR

40,Last day of desert concert,"Just walking around Rodeo Drive and all the adjoining streets. Lovely to look at, nice restaurants and shops. Great cars driving by. Once upon a time it was amazing because we did not have shops like this in Australia but now we have them all and in most of the major cities. Still nice to look at though. Lucky it was a beautiful day do we could just walk for hours",Susanne & Denis... S
40,Good shopping strip,"There are some collection stores that you'll find here which aren't found many other places, so worth going along to see what's unique. I bought a collection handbag from Michael Kors and we found a great shop for boots and leather luggage called West on Santa Monica Boulevard. I was particularly impressed by the professionalism of the shop assistants, it made the shopping experience all the more fun.",kgreenwood

30,A nice place to have photos taken,"This is a great place to gave your photos taken especially at the Beverly Willshire Hotel if you're a fan of the movie Pretty Woman which starred Julia Roberts. If you don't have a budget, just take photos and go window shopping but if you've got the Benjamins to splurge, then by all means spoil yourself or your girlfriend or wife! They have public parking if your driving your own car. The covered multi level parking is free for the first 2 hours and you pay after that. Sp if you're just there to take photos, tame note of the time limit to save on parking fees.",spooncar9

Everything is a very short walk from the Beverly Wiltshire.If you are coming from Australia you will love the experience of a personal shopper - service is very attentive. All of my goods - dresses and blouses were packed up in a suit carrier and hangers given as complimentary.I visited Tom Ford for a purchase and was astounded by the generosity of gratuity gifts - small vials of fragrance of my personal choice, given as samples, not your usual give aways.Many of the restaurants nearby do get very busy. I randomly tried five in the area as a walk in group of four and we were accommodated and consistently had excellent experiences of food, service, beverage and atmosphere.",Babycakes2014

50,Ooooo la la,What can I say. CHARGE IT!!! We were in LA for a girls weekend and we lost our minds shopping on Rodeo drive. Before you think we broke the bank our version of shopping was buying lipstick and trinkets LOL just to brag that we shopped on the famous Rodeo drive. We were hoping to bump into celebrities but that didn't happen. It was still fun just make believe if only for a weekend.,Hope Z

30,Interesting,I thought Rodeo Drive was an interesting place to visit. The stores are all high end and a bit pricey. A few movies were also filmed here so it's nice to visit if you are interested. It's a nice place to walk about and experience the local culture and food.,R Giansanti
50,Swanky!,"Apart from visiting it in the middle of a crowded day, we walked on Rodeo drive late at night( since our hotel was around the corner) a couple of times.Since we werent going to buy anything here ( obviously :P) , late night stroll on the street is preety refreshing- you window shop in peace, admire the creative, niche window displays and feel the cool air around you ( it was quite hot in the day 38 degree celsius) . Not to forget, click all the selfies you want.Lots of Swanky stores and cars parked on the street (Lamborghini, Rolls Royce- you name it) .When we visted there was an outdoor exibition of sculptures by Dali . So that was a treat.",hmphhh!
40,You just have to see it when in LA,"My wife and I enjoyed our visit to Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive in particular. We found our the area clean and aesthetically appealing most probably enhanced by our previous day visits to the more dingy and tacky areas of LA.My wife loves to shop for dresses, shoes, bags and cosmetics and, in Rodeo Drive, she had more than enough options to explore. Of course most of it was outside our price range but to stroll and window shop along the beautifully kept streets and stores was a pleasant break from Hollywood, Downtown LA and the like.The Dali art exhibition was on during our visit which was fortunate for us and enhanced our experience of the area. We spent about 4 hours in the area, grabbed a coffee and bite to eat, and then caught a bus back to Downtown.From a husbands point of view, there is not a great deal to do if you don't like shopping, and I wouldn't think a lengthy stay with small children would be all that much fun. But it is worth a visit just to see the opulence and famous landmarks that we have witnessed in many movies and TV show.",Neil D
50,Flash Shopping Trip,I was really surprised how friendly everyone was in the stores. I thought they would be sick of tourist coming in to the stores. Instead they were down to earth and laughed at all the crazy things that happen. Great wine and cocktails at Wally's,Deborah B

50,Smell of burning plastic,"Recently had a private tour of LA by platinum tours, ( highly recommend by the way) who took us to Beverley Hills and stopped at Rodeo Drive. We went to Beverley Hills Wilshire hotel which was used in the film Pretty Women and also the fashion shop where Julia Roberts was given a hard time. All the designer stores ate here probably heaven for most but I felt my credit card melting. Jewellery worth $300'000 + amazing !!!!",CrackingJohn

40,Mingling with the rich and famous for a day!,"Even though most people wont ever buy anything, I still reckon it's worth a visit, if for no other reason than to pretend to be one of the rich and famous for a day! It's one of those sights that are a ""must visit"" for any trip to LA, though it should be said that you dont have to spend all day here. Make sure you wander the streets around Rodeo Drive to go see the Beverly Hills sign. But be warned, it might be hard to get a taxi so I had to grab an Uber back to my hotel.",belweckert
50,Oh I wish!!,"Visited Rodeo Drive as part of a road trip. We did do some shopping at Tiffanys, lucky me, but dressed as a tourist in shorts and flip flops there were definitely some shops that I wouldn't have entered.....we've all seen Pretty Woman!

Everybody dressed in hugely expensive clothes and decked out in fantastic jewelry. Going into the shops my wife and daughter definitely felt like Julia Roberts did in Pretty Woman. Whether they intend to or not, they give you a look of affordability as you walk through the door!Well worth going. We went on a local box car tram tour which gave us lots of great information about the area and we went to get a photograph with the famous Beverly Hilton Hotel and Welcome to Beverly Hills, along with the public toilets George Michael was found in, etc, etc.We finished off with lunch at the orignal, first ever Cheesecake Factory.

Chanel is rich enough to pay last December 152 Million for the building... You wish to see ""celebrities?

Be to sure to head back a few streets from the strip as there's another vast option of shops not necessarily with the price tag.Window shop, people watch and just enjoy the experience.It's worth a walk down at night too. There was a film crew filming and amazing Christmas scene on one of the nights. Complete with fake snow and the over the top Christmas figurines and decorations. It was all gone by the next morning - you would never know it had even been there.Hate shopping or love it - definite worth a visit just for the experience.",iceruby

50,Walking the same streets as Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.,"Definitely a place where you gotta have lots of money to just throw around. Just the cars are extravagant.

I hope I don't offend anyone but in general I don't like Los Angeles, I found the city to be cold, tacky, with neighborhoods like this very expensive, chick but lacking charm.

40,The Champs-Élysées of LA,"If you're shopping on a budget, this place is definitely not for you. Upscale boutiques and designer stores line the streets of this upscale shopping district. From Givenchy to Bally, the haute couture apparel and accessories will surely satiate whatever fancy appetite you may have, but of course, be prepared to break out your checkbook. Some of these stores even offer you a glass of champagne after you make a purchase. If you are looking for moderately prefixed clothing and accessories that probably won't break the bank, I'd suggest the Westfield Mall.",ThatAmericanTourist

But even at night, which the store closed, there are hundreds who walk on a warm night window shopping and taking pictures adpfter dinner. Park blocks away..the walk will be good for you..parking o. rodeo is very limited and the traffic is frustrating. Stop for coffee at one of the out door cafes. Whether you can afford to shop these stores or not, it's a fun place to walk around and have lunch or a snack for a few hours",BCMCLover
50,Agood day shopping,"We had a day out shopping, simply because you have to do it when your there :) Prices are what you would imagine them to be on Rodeo Drive, as a tourist I felt quite underdressed when amongst other shoppers, dressed in their finery. I did buy a fabulous pair of designer shoes, long evening dress, fabulous jacket ( in a sale) .. An experience I shall remember but you need to be a lottery winner or very rich to buy all that caught your eye",travellingquen
40,Worth seeing,"Can be quickly done as a drive through the area or a walk down the streets to see the amazing storefronts, window displays and cars parked along the street. Went on a Saturday around 7 so it was easy to find free street parking. Most stores were closed. Our only poor experience was when we were crossing the street and took a picture and had a local honk and make rude gestures at us. Showed some of these upper class individuals have no manners! On the other hand we walked into Louis Vuitton and were welcomed and treated with great respect.",RJC1919

I expected prices to be high. They weren't higher than comparable stores in other cities. I was looking for a high end watch. I was able to negotiate a better deal on rodeo drive than I could in Costa Mesa. The store employees are incredibly well educated and helpful. I would shop there if I was looking for something those stores sold. I would stroll through the streets just for the relaxing walk and to people and car watch. I promise you'll see some interesting sights of both.,mrhover

50,Stunning high end shopping street,"Well worth its international reputation. Of course most luxurious brands are located there and many of them also have a stunning architecture which can very well be the main attraction of the area. Palm trees add to its charm. Via Rodeo Drive, a very cute pedestrian small street is a charming passage not to be missed. Surrounding streets share same atmosphere.",Tanmouss
30,Nice place,"This is a nice place to spend a little time , a lot od very expensive shops, there are many shopping erae impressive than this, but y can't compitate the famous name",Proyair
50,Visited it some time back,I went there about 1.5 years back. Christmas was just over and it was early January. It was beautifully decorated. The streets were beautiful. I was making 360 degree trying to take it all in. Definitely a must see at this time of year.,Maybelater15
50,Experiencing a taste of the rich and famous,We didn't shop but we did explore and take photos. We saw the hotel from Pretty Woman. We went inside. We also visited another hotel and was able to go to the roof top pool for photos.,Buckeye_Mom_2013
50,Beautiful but worryingly cleansed,"Lovely place, one of the few attractions which is as your would expect.Great for a stroll, something to eat and some people watching.However, every other place in LA has a serious problem with homeless people. We didn't see 1 in Beverley Hills, assume the council have cleansed them into other areas to make the place look nice - very sad.",230JH230
50,My Happy Place,I couldn't live my life properly without rodeo Dr. Almost every store is a flagship of some sort. You can get free parking in a couple garages. My favorite is the one on Brighton way around the corner from David Yurman. If you're in LA don't miss a Rodeo Dr. Shopping experience.,RachelAMullins
50,beautiful location,nice place - worth checking out while in LA . perhaps get some nice clothes or accesories or just ocme for people watching,samanta
30,Leave the credit card at home,"Rodeo Drive is another in the long list of ""have to see it once"" attractions LA has to offer. Most of us will never buy anything here but it's still worth a look",NUFCadl
30,Average sightseeing,"Do it to claim you've done it. I like being able to see something on TV and tell people I've been there. That's about all it is. Parking is expensive and if you travel just a couple streets over it gets pretty ""grimey"" pretty quick.Unless you have a Black card or titanium card then you'll probably walk up one side of the street, down the other, get in the car and continue on your day.You will probably see some cool cars during the walk!",Evan L
40,Shop Shop Shop and car gazing,"Well, shoppers paradiseBrands, you name it and it's here. All latest of the season can be found here.Another 'attraction' here is where you can ' car gazing' where the luxury sports aplenty.",RobertChew-MY
40,"Busy but if you like shopping, you'll love it.","If you like designer brands and don't mind the crowds, you'll enjoy Rodeo. Staff seem very polite and respectful to everyone so that's nice, given most people are just drooling and touching the merchandise.. I'm not a big shopper so perhaps my opinion is not relevant but personally, I'd be off the the spectacular (free) Getty Centre before I spent more time in shops. But that's just me.",Passingthru63
40,Nice area when you have spare change,The was so much wealth in one little area and it was unbelievable. What i got from my coaching job was not enough to pay for 5 decent shirts at a discounted price. Let alone the watches on sale.,Maps582139
40,"Don't be intimidated...just have fun shopping, eating and people watching","Rodeo Drive just seems like a cool place to shop and eat and people watch. Who'd a thunk it? When you hear Rodeo Drive, there are connotations of THE highest prices and caricature-like salespeople with their noses in the air. Not so in my opinion.Mind you the prices are higher than average. But it's no different than going to places like Bal Harbour in Miami, the north end of Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, or one of the many premium shopping collections in Las Vegas. Or the high end mall in most metro areas.It's nice because it's pedestrian friendly with the ability to just walk between shops for a long stretch without having to move your vehicle. If you like shopping and aren't a bargain shopper, just check it out - don't be afraid.",ObjectiveWords
50,Awesome sight at night at Christmas time,"We walked down Rodeo Dr and this was simply a beautiful street with lots of high end shops and restaurants. Flash cars all around. We met up with Santa & Mrs Claus and took some photos, absolutely wonderful people.",dccoutts
40,Great Fun People Watching....,"We went here on holiday from the UK (five adults). We parked in a private car park on Rodeo Drive. Not cheap but worth it. Rodeo Drive (the posh bit) is not as long as I expected, but it is very glitzy and great fun. Tourists mingle with proper shoppers and we had a great time. For a laugh we did the Trolley Bus tour of Beverley Hills, a bargain at $5 each, and great fun driving round the area including some houses of the stars. Definitely worth doing....You might struggle for somewhere to eat, but just off Rodea Drive there are more options. We hit the Cheesecake Factory on North Beverly Drive (one block east) - good choice.",Philip H
40,Better in the movies than in person,"Eh. It was glamoury and glitzy so I gave it 4 stars, but really, I don't need to go here again. But I kind of feel that way about most of Beverly Hills. I guess maybe there was a time before mass transportation, cell phones, the internet, etc. that locations like this were exotic to the average person, but nowadays you can buy the stuff sold in these overpriced chain / franchise stores anywhere (if you plan to drop a small fortune on things you don't really need).If like me, you would never even consider spending so much money on things like clothes, purses, and shoes, and just come here for the entertainment of being on Rodeo Drive like in the movies, it's just not as exciting in person as on the big screen. It's clean and some of the buildings have beautiful architecture. There is a little courtyard near Wiltshire with a fountain and some steps that reminded me of hanging out in the center of town in Amalfi, Italy. But other than that -- boring. And with so much money, you'd think they'd figure out a way to shade the street a little better because those super extra tall palm trees give absolutely no shade from the brutal California sun.This time, there was a Dali sculpture exhibit on the street with some beautiful shining sculptures of knights, unicorns, warriors on horse, etc. That was probably the best part.",kesrya
50,Rodeo Drive = Designer Drive,"Valet parking, Designer boutiques, Shopping at its' best... Just wish I didn't have a budget. We enjoyed our stroll and successful shopping trip in search of the perfect desgner handbag - Gotta love the service at the Louis Vuitton store!",Shelly S
30,Shops and Dining,"Rodeo drive is ... just a bunch of shops, restaurants, and plastic surgeon offices on a famous street. It's where either the rich play, the want to be rich pretend they have money, and to people watch. Myself, spend an afternoon or if you want the spa treatments the day. However it is overpriced for the service. If you want a new hairdo.... haircuts are outrageously priced and stylists not that good, you are paying for the address only. It's a place you go to once, to say you saw it.",Shelley K
40,Must see for tourists,"We did a quick stop here. Mainly to see it since it's so famous in Hollywood movies, including in Pretty Woman. Lots of expensive shops including Prada. So we didn't do any shopping it but was fun to walk around. It's much smaller than I thought it would be, just a few streets. It's a nice stop or drive through if you're a tourist.",KayWAmsterdam
50,Nice shopping!,Good fun if you are in town and want to check out the designer stores. Watch the world go by and do some people watching! Nice setting with palm trees and sunshine!,Roy K
40,"The usual high-caliber shopping street, but very nice with palm trees","The shops are the same as in any major city around the world, so no major excitement. But the setting is very nice with the palm trees, the sunshine and the buzz. Worth strolling for a while and absorbing...before moving on! Shopping-wise, indulge only if it is your only chance, as you can shop for the same anywhere else in the world, so no need to ship stuff home unless you want to.",Francesca_in_London

50,Perfect Picturesque Visit,"Visited for about an hour solely for the purposes of pictures and it did not disappoint.

There are a lot of great restaurants close by as well.",ExpSid15
40,The Heart of Beverly Hills,A great place to take a stroll. Underground city parking is available and most likely needed due to limited street parking. Elegance and lots of culinary choices. Valet parking is available.,Jerry R
30,Nothing Spectacular,It's just shopping. This wasn't one of the highlights of our trip. We went just because it's Rodeo drive but I say drive it and keep it moving,Monique G

30,"OK for Tourists, Not So Much for Locals","I'm no fashionista, don't care about celebrities and I like bargains. You will see tons of tourists from all over the world. You'll see nice cars driving by, but it won't take long to determine the place is generally overrated. But, once you are done and you get hungry head over to Nate'n Al Delicatessen for a great restaurant where you will see some ""old school"" BH types AKA locals.",Jason W
20,Do not expect too much,"Unless you are loaded with cash, don't expect to see too much here. Fancy shops are here but if you are normal average Joe like me, it would be a waste of your time going in to them because you know you could afford nothing. Nice to see but don't plan on spending too much time here. No celeb's about on my day lol",Centre p

30,Not as good as it sounds,"Rodeo drive , famous for being famous . Its a large street filled with expensive shops. Really boring after a while, because the shops are the same in every city. The street needs more shade or trees and definitely needs to have some coffee shops spread amongst the shops so people can sit down and relax while they shop. It was probably one of the most disapointing famous places I have visited.",RickX01
30,If you're into windowshopping..,"This is the place.. Expensive stores and not too many places to eat. I wanted to check it out, boyfriend were not so interested. In retrospect I must admit, we could have spent our time some where else..",Eline H

These stores are the same ones in New York, London and Paris and many other cites in the world. However it is clean and beautiful and full of flagship stores. For people who want to buy or look at overpriced items usually made in China or the Far East continue it helps our economy. My favorite store is Hermes however don't expect great service unless you are dressed in a certain way!",DeniseCohenGershon
50,Shop 'til you drop.....,"Rodeo Drive is high end. No doubt about it. All the big brands - LV, Gucci, Dior, Saint Laurent, Hermes etc. whether you're there with the ability to buy or just window shopping, rodeo drive is fun. It's a beautiful wide, palm tree-lined, boulevard where you can people watch for those arriving in their rolls Royce or Ferrari. We started with a coffee at the Beverly Wiltshire and walked up, and back, then headed to the nearby department stores (Barneys, Saks etc). I recommend Uber to get there. Traffic in LA is a nightmare. If driving, there is a valet.",Alix R

30,"It's Famous, So We Drove By","Driving in this section of the LA area is stressful. Was it worth the hassle of getting there? Probably not, but we had the time and now we can say we were there.

20,Nothing special,I am not quite sure why this is attraction. This is just a short street with famous brands. There are plenty of similar streets in many other towns. Not more 15 mins to spend there unless of course you are going to do some shopping.,Vuk M
30,Ok on a tour bus,It really isn't that much for the average person to see. Ok for a tour bus and what one would expect in Hollywood. Not super long as one might expect.,631kristelf
40,Interesting spectacle,Only spent an hour here. It was mostly full of tourists window shopping. This area is full of only really high end shops most can't afford to shop in. It's still great to look though. There were also quite a few high end cars parked along the road that people were taking their photos with.We visited one gallery that had some exhibition of Dali and Picasso prints that was great to see.Lovely area and worth a quick visit.,JulesW18

50,RODEO DRIVE BABY!,Pretty Woman is my favorite movie so I could not resist! I enjoyed strolling on Rodeo Drive. Shoppers paradise and hope you have deep pockets. This was a Pretty Woman movie stop for me so I window shopped. I also went by the Beverly Wilshire Hotel where they filmed portions of the movie. Great time on Rodeo Drive.,Valencia C
30,Plan on spending your paycheck.,"It's good for window shopping. There are very few elite retailers that you won't find here. And, even a few you can find at your local outlet mall.",Cindy
40,Great place to visit though out of most people's price range shops,"I'm glad we visited the iconic Rodeo Drive, beautifully clean and polished as you would expect, expensive cars line the street & match the types of designer shops. The pedestrian area is very pretty and at the time we visited had Dali sculptures displayed along the street. There were lots of parking lots but all were expensive, you're looking at around 2 dollars per 15mins so it's not the place you'd want to spend the day but worth going to see how the other half live!",lesoley333
30,Worth only minor detour,"Starting with the positive, if you love to shop- either actually or just the window variety- then this is your place. However if labels and generally the rather vulgar flaunting of wealth are not your thing, I suggest you spend now more than 30 minutes or so - so you can at least said you have seen it even if you did not buy the Chanel tee shirt .",Amerdav
40,Cool for a first time visit,"Rodeo Drive was one of the stops on an all-day tour of LA. It's one of those places you have to visit at least once just to say you've been there. The shops are the typical names you can see at an upscale mall in most major cities. Lots of fancy cars. Took a pic with a convertible Rolls Royce. I even thought I saw Kim Kardashian, but when she turned around I realized it wasn't her.Good place to window shop and walk around.",Christian P
50,The main attraction to Beverly Hills.,"I did not spend as much time here as my wife but I did enjoy a walk and a Segway down it, if nothing more than simply to people watch. The stores are finest brands with the highest prices. My wife did more buying in other areas, but it was fun just to see what was for sale here. I will confess while naked consumerism is not my thing, I can not imagine a visit to LA without a visit here to see it.",Grover R
50,Great place to Visit and to Spend if you have lots of Money,"This is a wonderful place to window shop unless you have a lot of money or a good credit card. Every high end vendor is here and it is beautiful to walk through. You will see more Bentleys, Rolls, etc in this small stretch. Wonderful for everyone",J0hnPM10
20,The Stark Contrast Between The Haves and Have Nots,"Rodeo Drive has to be the greatest example of the difference between the haves and the have nots. Where else in the world, within a seemingly short distance can you go from the excesses of fashion to the extreme, luxury cars aplenty and global luxury brands and within a few short miles to rows of tents along the freeway overpasses and homeless people. Probably the best example of what America has become.........dripping wealth versus human tragedy existing within a few hundred yards of each other.",Mark L
40,"A must visit if your in the Beverly Hills area, and nice to visit any time of the day.",There's some great cafes in the area if the label shopping is not in your budget. A great shopping environment and must visit.,Notbad2014

Nowhere to have a coffee at a reasonable price, but although many tourists visit this area, it caters more to the rich locals who don't look at the price tag. Worth a visit...

30,A must see for a new visit to LA,I was lucky enough to be in a tour that took us through Rodeo Drive and had a great guide that di scribes many of the shops an buildings.The only reason I didn't rank it higher is because I am not a shopper and would not have gone there except as a tourist destination.,Michelle J
50,Mega exotic cars!!! Free parking garage after 6pm!,"We didn't go into any shops. Just got us some smoothies. We were there for the cars!

We have seen a few celebrities walking down the street while there different years, which gives the GF a thrill.We tend to go around Xmas time where they make it snow down Rodeo drive, and you get to see all of the xmas decorations.

Of course we just window shopped but it was fun to see how the other 1/4 lives :) It amazed me how may Bentley's and Ferrari's we saw. If you had a Mercedes you were poor haha. Very fun place to see.,Christine M
30,Was expecting more?,I was expecting way more when we visited Rodeo Drive. After a quick drive down I didn't even really want to stop to get out and look around. Way out of my budget and too be honest it didn't appeal to me at all. Can tick it off the list though.,Joshane615
30,Money money money!,Every store on rodeo drive is expensive to shop in. One of the stores refused to let my son and I inside. The woman actually told us that we couldn't afford to shop there. I should have gotten angry but I found her arrogance almost funny. It was a teachable moment for my son. The best part of our visit was watching all of the super cars that pass by every couple of minutes.,Crescent98
40,Luxury shopping at its best,"I hit just about every other shopping center in LA, and decided to visit Rodeo Drive to complete my journey. Not only is the street beautiful, you're bound to see your share of luxury cars and often times, celebrities. It is absolutely worth a visit to the Louis Vuitton store, it's the biggest I've ever seen!",Keulio
50,7 Lamborghinis in 10 minutes!,I knew this is the place to go if rich and famous so I had to go and have a peek at the lifestyle! We say 7 Lamborghinis in 10 minutes as well as a custom Rolls Royce and walked past some very fancy shops although I was too weary to actually go in any! Either way I got a peep into how the other half live :),Kay8991
40,Fun. Cheap to look but expensive to shop.,Incredible window shopping but unless you have A LOT of money to spend not really a shopping destination. Great people watching. Good restaurants.,Culinary-widow
50,Wow,"Lots of boutiques, shops, stores, pubs, cafes, restaurants along this stretch. Enjoyed walking the drive and watching the people.",Rita S
40,Beverly Hills,"This is a very nice area and, neighborhood! The food was fantastic, even did a little shopping at Cartier for a new watch! If you looking to see nice exotic cars then that's definitely the place to be!",AshleeWells
40,Great place to walk/sightsee,"This is a fun area to walk around and see the surrounding stores. My friends and family have loved to visit and sight see. This is a perfect LA picture spot, too!",TravelRobs
40,Beautiful areas with nice boutique,Branded boutiques are along the area but most of the luxurious goods are rather expensive. But for branded lovers u should never skip this place. Nice place to take pictures too.,Lina chandra
50,Real Tourist of Beverly Hills,"Nice place! Good weather, nice cars and plenty of shopping. Eclectic mix of brand retail outlets, organic food stores, burger joints and restaurants.",Man_from_Melbourne
30,meh...,Iconic place to go while in los angeles. We found this part of LA to be boring and pointless... we are not shoppers but we were curious about the place.,Josianne D
50,Must See,"While there could be much debate over the lavishness and excess that Rodeo Drive represents, one thing that can't be argued is the amazing craftsmanship of the boutiques lining this street. Much of the items in these boutiques are made by hand, by some of the finest master craftspeople in the world. All of which have dedicated their lives to reaching the absolute best in their class. Clothing, jewelry, accessories, cars, and luxury are all on display.While out of my economic league, I enjoyed browsing the boutiques and people watching that only Rodeo Drive can deliver.It is definitely worth a stroll if you are nearby!",CrazyVikingSr
30,It's ok for a wander,It's worth visiting for a wander... The shops here are really high end so depending on your budget it's not somewhere you'd go to do actual shopping. It is nice to walk around the Beverly Hills area in general.. There's some nice places to eat around here too!,Vikki M
50,High end shopping,Took a drive through here just to look around. Lots of shops and nice cars. Was looking for celebrities but didn't have any luck. Oh well,Vader8218
30,High end shopping strip,This is the high end shopping strip in Beverly Hills. Parking is a headache here. There are two small public parking garages at the intersection of Santa Monica & Rodeo. Street parking is scarce. I suggest you skip this if you are not into high end shopping.,skier101
30,If you like blowing your money on expensive things it's OK,"Rodeo Dr is high on the list of upscale places to shop. I expected platinum blondes in heels with mini-dogs in their purses. What I got is a lot of slow traffic through an outdoor mall with gawkers like myself.If you really like the high end shopping, this is definitely a great place to go because al the best top-notch places are here.",mitch708
40,Beautiful houses,Most reviews of this area concentrate on the famous shopping area but I was quite taken with the houses located between Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard - stunning.,Albywon
40,Fun stop during the car show,"We visited Rodeo Drive during the June car show, the road was closed to traffic which made it really easy to stroll along. The cars were awesome and it was fun to window shop as we passed by. We didn’t stay long, but it was interesting to experience it in person.",iroamaround67801
50,Ritzy Rodeo Drive Roundup!,"Oh the place where dreams are made! What a fun place to window shop and maybe even engage in a bit of indulgence! Rodeo Drive is the place to see and be seen. From world class shopping to world class celebrities, Rodeo Drive has it all! A beautiful park just a few blocks away with the iconic Beverly Hills sign, and a short walk takes you right to the heart of Rodeo Drive. There is some affordable shopping here but it is also fun to window shop down the avenue and hopefully spot a celebrity shopping incognito! I had deliberately put some extra trip money aside for a little shopping on Rodeo Drive and came home with my own little treasure. But just walking down the street and looking in the beautiful windows and mingling with the people was a lot of fun and should definitely be part of your trip to LA. I really enjoyed being on this world-renowned street and enjoying the beautiful items displayed in the windows and meandering in several of the shops just for fun. And if you have a good eye for recognizing celebrities, this is the place to be. It is a wonderful way to spend a few hours while getting some exercise and maybe just a ""little something"" to take home from one of the most famous shopping places in the world!",LoriJMK
50,Glamorous,"Just as you would imagine, all the best shops, all very welcoming and not at all stuffy- so different to the snootyness that can come across in the uk, that's the American way I suppose.",Donna E
50,So many fancy cars!,"This is the place to be if you want to see fancy cars. Our younger son was fascinated and would ask his dad what type of car was passing every few seconds as we walked down the street. We obviously did not come here to shop! We also saw the Dali Exhibit at Two Rodeo Drive where there are 12 sculptures by Salvador Dali. We liked that the street they were on reminded us of European streets. As we were there on a Wednesday, it wasn't very busy at all.",Tofurry
40,Cool Salvadore Dali sculptures,"Went to Rodeo Drive just to see it since it's ""the place"" to go in Beverly Hills. It's everything you expect to see... every high end brand name you can imagine packed into one stretch of road. Currently there are several Salvadore Dali sculptures on display outside on the walkways for the public to see and take pictures... neat to have an ""outdoor museum"".",jmuckley
30,Curiosity cured,"It was nice to walk and visit to say you've been there. Took our picture by the ""Beverly Hills"" sign and then we were done. Checked off our list.",ericaa28
40,Just fun to watch all that money,"The incredible high end stores, an outdoor Dali sculpture exhibit, and watching people that actually shop there. And OMG the cars: Ferraris, Rolls, Bentleys, and sports cars I couldn't even tell the make. We're from Montana, and there was even a classic Lincoln (with suicide doors) from the county north of us!",tacocands
30,Ok,"Ok, to see because it's in so many shows/movies but I didn't find to be a ""must see area"". Interesting to see only to fill curiosity.",MsshellyB
40,Impressive,"This place is everything we thought it would be!So many high end shops it was amazing to see. The whole area is such a classy place to visit.Find a street parking spot if you can, valet parking is so damn expensive and all parking garages are valet. A lot of Rich snobs are there so be prepared to just shake ur head if ur an average family like us,,, lolIt is an amazing place to visit!",Srmccracken
50,"Must visit..shopping, people watching, Cars!!","Awesome shopping, people watching and amazing cars go up and down the street. Wow! The roar of the exotic cars is fabulous. Shop staff are extremely friendly.",BestTravelsNow
30,Visit based on reputation,"As we are in LA, I decided to take my family down Rodeo Drive in order to see this world famous street. There is nothing special about this street (if compared to similar streets in Paris, London, New York or Sydney), it is again one of those things that you want to be able to say you have seen this street, don't think there is much more you would get from a trip here.",TrevorBurchell
40,Must see for families with a teenage girl,"Of course we had to drive down rodeo drive and see Beverly Hills while we were in LA. It is worth the detour and you see lots of fancy shops, houses and cars.",Del C
50,Eye opening,All of the excess that you'd come to expect from Beverly Hills. Explore the side streets as they have some great restaurants and cafes.,Adam N
50,Really nice drive and reminded us of Pretty Woman!,We drove by Rodeo drive on purpose. It was a lovely area with beautiful housing and shops. If your in La it's worth a drive by for the experience,Alan H
40,Fun to see,"On Beverly drive next to Rodeo are underground parking garages where you can park for free for 2 hours. We found inexpensive restaurants on this street and then walked over one block to go up and down Rodeo. The shops are definitely for the rich and if you walk in one to look around they don't greet you...just like in Pretty Woman. They know who has money. We took a lot of photos of all the high dollar cars you don't normally see, body guards, drivers, etc. Interesting people watching. On Santa Monica is the iconic Beverly Hills sign and park for photo opp.",BushkaTexas
50,Fantastic Dali Exhibition,We had a couple of hours to kill before flying out of LA so we decided to take a drive to Beverley Hills and have a look around. We easily found a park and wandered down Rodeo Drive doing some people and car watching.It was a lovely day and a bit of fun but best of all we stumbled across the Dali Sculptures. These were stunning and well worth a visit.,Kevin H
40,Box ticked,Nice to have seen the place and another box ticked however if you want to go shopping somewhere that you don't need to sell a kidney to pay for something then head to Santa Monica.,Philip B
50,Shopping on Rodeo Drive,"What trip to Los Angeles would be complete without taking my wife to Rodeo Drive for some shopping. This was her first trip to Los Angeles. After living in south Beach where parking can be really hard and expensive if you aren't a resident, we found parking on rodeo Drive easy and cheap. You can do metered parking, but some is limited to 1 hour at a time of parking garage/valet. $10 a day. After parking we walked around checking out the shops until seeing something in Guess she wanted to buy. Being Rodeo Drive there were plenty of staff and they took good care of you. The shopping experience was excellent. give yourself plenty of time as there are a lot of shops to see. Also hopefully budget for this to pay full price as you will not find your outlet stores. Even if not buying a nice place to window shop.",risitodeplata
30,Reminds me of Las Vegas,"Well, The Palms are pretty. It's hot - like 110 degrees. Don't take little ones. There are no family restaurants. You must have money to relax here. Not my cup but maybe yours.",WjF
40,fun to see how the rich spend there money....,"straight out of a movie... all the glitz, glamor, and reckless spending you would expect... get a coffee and watch the ultra rich stroll by... almost like being in a people zoo watching the pretty pi-cocks parade around...",jasonphoto
50,You have to do it,Did I do it? You bet! Was it fun? Heck yes--couldn't stop snapping pictures. Should You do it? Of course you should. Would I do it again? Only if I were with a friend.,Herdlinger
30,Wort of seeing,"Leave your credit card in hotel before visiting Rodeo Drive. It is full of shoes of the top brans and the prices are extremely high. Nice place for window shopping and trying to see rich and famous people. Parking a car is also in huge prices if you happens to drive to ""wrong"" parking hall.",Juha P
40,Branded Goods Collection Centre!,Friends who have visited Beverly Hills and Hollywood remember this spot. Though the items sold may be priced about 30% more yet there is no shortage of purchasers!,Syed Ahmad I
30,See it once,"The city of Beverly Hills is relatively small, at least it's business district. The shopping streets around and including Rodeo Drive are small and close together. Watch you don't bump that Rolls Royce or the tourist in a family car!! Rodeo is home to high end stores and some clerks with attitudes! 😳 never fear, they'll smell the money on you if you are there to shop! 💐 otherwise, grab a latte and hot foot it around--- better yet, drive up and down the streets once and head over to The Grove or Citiwalk or an outdoor mall in Glendale or Pasadena for some real fun.BONUS: go to the Lake Shrine Temple in close by Malibu for a nice quiet relaxing walk around the lake!",bubbly_sunshine
40,Great for shopping!,"Every shop you could imagine is on this street, from Louis Vuitton to Vera Wang. It's not as big / long as it looks on TV but it's pretty amazing.",Bogolo
50,Are You Somebody?,"We shopped all along Rodeo Drive when we had a stop over on our way to San Diego. We didn't see any celebrities but when we popped into a restaurant for lunch, the waitress swooped in and looked me straight in the eye and asked me 'are you somebody?' What a funny place... I laughed out loud! I think one would have to be a somebody to afford most of what is displayed in shop windows. It was fun though.",thewoodlandwalk
30,"highly overrated, not really worth a visit","It's every high end shop thrown together with absolutely no atmosphere. If you're looking for glamour you'll be disappointed as it's really just tourists and a few locals showing off the fancy cars they can't drive fast because there is too much traffic. Be warned, there are other spots.",Ollywang
40,Fun to walk down,Beautiful area in Beverly Hills. Fun to walk down to see all the big name brands and the store Badgley Mischka (featured in Pretty Woman) is there also. We also saw some great cars too!,Viajadoradelmundo
50,A Must Do,If you are visiting Beverly Hills - Rodeo Drive is a must do. It is the place to be seen and to people watch while shopping or enjoying a bite to eat. Best place in the world (other than Paris and Rome) to see what is happening in the world fashion-wise.,TravlFam
40,Exciting,"Fun to walk down and see all the expensive stores and shops. Pretty area and if you can't afford to buy something, take lots of pictures to prove you were on the famous Rodeo Drive.",Sherry A
40,Upper class mode,The place is aPlayground for the rich and famous .people that has monies to burn.it is also nice to know how the other side of the world lives..you can also see a lot of top range cars parading around and a lot of skinny gorgeous ladies overflowing an organic /healthy eatery:),MK
30,Expensive,Worth a ride in the car but nothing special unless you have ghd cash to spend. Over priced items and stuffy shop sellts,Mje2014
50,Spent some cash,It was larger than life. Reminded me of Las Vegas. Beautiful Palm Trees and showy cars. Really heats up in the afternoon. The stone facades and asphalt adds to the discomfort. I'd rather take North Park in Dallas with shaded parking.,emily f
50,Expensive shopping,It's fun to take a walk down this famous shopping street just for the experience. The stores are all high end. Who knows you may see a celebrity parking their car or shopping in a store.,Ramadama
40,Skin Radiation therapy for me! :-D,"Great walk along the Rodeo drive with a few promises from the hubby :-) Window shopping, fun to watch around, a good lunch!",Rachna A
20,Brash,It's a shopping street for the rich and famous. It's not really an attraction. There are better streets and centres in many cities throughout the world.,Rewst
50,Went for dinner and some celebrity sight seeing,If you want to run into a celebrity in Beverly Hills you have to go to rodeo drive. Between the shopping and excellent restaurants. You will no doubt see a few. Just remember they are a lot of times with their families so make sure you treat them just like anyone else. But many are approachable for a quick hello. Try parking below or in the parking building so as to avoid looking for parking on rodeo drive. It's almost impossible.,Herblopez1971
50,A nice walk,"If you like to look at beautiful people and vehicles this is the best place to do it. Lots of high end stores and the place is spotless, really enjoyed 2 Rodeo Drive as there was alot of Salvador Dali sculptures on display. My daughter loved the stores especially Tori Burch.",Marc T
50,Must see when in LA,Rodeo drive is a classic tourist spot but if you want nice pictures go before 10 as the boutiques don't open early. Sprinkles is a go stopping point for a sugar fix.,R M
50,Hollywood is Hollywood,"Don't miss it out, which I'm sure you won't. Relive the Pretty Women scenes here and see, smell, hear the Hollywood in the air!",Toni W
40,Just as expected.,Fantastic shopping with premium brands as expected. Immaculate and well kept and clean but did not feel out of place.,HazelB333
40,Fun people watching,Really high end stores. Not for your average shopper. We were there during a car aficionados event and the street was full of high end antique and current cars. It was really cool to stumble upon.,Rob M
50,Fabulous,Beautiful to stroll and to shop. Designer shopping and lovely to see. A must do in Beverly Hills even if you are just window shopping!,Karen C
50,Fun!,"Rodeo Drive is nit your typical retail shopping experience. All luxury stores. And, it's fun just to people watch. Maybe spot a star or a wannabe star or fashion model. As a car enthusiast, car spotting is a full time sport: everything from Rolls Royce, Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Maserati. Look for the bright yellow Roll Royce convertible outside Bijan ... Can't miss it!",Wineaux FromAlexandria
50,So much fun!,Every time I think of this place I think of 'Pretty Women' and I keep thinking that Julia Roberts walking down Rodeo Dr. Ever since I was a little girl I've always wanted to walk down Rodeo Dr. It's so much fun here and beautiful. I love going into all the high end shops. It's definitely worth the visit. Don't pay for parking. There are parking garages on the streets that run parallel to Rodeo Dr that are free for two hours.,Deborah j
50,A must see!,"You have to go here even if you are not shopping. A lot of things to see and a lot of nice cars and shops, but very expensive.",vickylito
40,Must-See for the fame,"Rodeo is a must-see due to its pure famous appeal. I visited with my friend around 9AM on a saturday, and needless to say it was empty. Visit Rodeo and Bev hill and window shop, grab a coffee, enjoy the weather. I recommend spending about an hour here to view the art, as well.",Taylor G
50,A must in your itinerary,This is a place you need to enjoy walking the streets...reasonable parking prices and a vast glamour around. Pictures of the Beverly Hills sign is a must and is for free. Have an iced cream fron the ice cream lab.,Rafamar
50,'Rodeo Drive Baby!',"Great experience. Obv. went with the intention of knowing we'd only be window shopping. For anyone who thinks they will actually purchase anything on this street, be prepared to spend some $$$! It's a novelty. To see where Pretty Woman was filmed and all the super cars, it's an hour or two I would recommend to everyone. Loved it!",Nicola Culligan
40,Lovely shop fronts,"We arrived on a Sunday, not knowing it would all be closed by 4pm, we did some good window shopping anyway which worked out much cheaper for me!",Gurnico
50,Luxury All The Way,"We loved shopping on Rodeo Drive and just walking the drive, The shopping is all high end with the latest trends. Great people watching and a cool and trendy vibe!",ExpatMom4
40,Visiting Rodeo,"I guess if you are visiting Beverly Hills, you should visit Rodeo Drive. It's certainly fun to walk and people watch. There are many great stores and art galleries. My friends would not necessarily describe me as thrifty but I found it very difficult to shop at Rodeo Drive prices. I don't think I saw a purse under $2800 or shoes under $500. There was a lovely jacket in the front window of one of the stores. I popped in to check the price. It was $5800 plus tax in U.S. Dollars. If you're Canadian, add 30 percent. The jacket was gorgeous and certainly grabbed my attention but approximately $9000 with conversion is a little high even for me. Overall, Rodeo Drive is nice and it is certainly a must see. The restaurants in the area were excellent with what I would consider very reasonable prices compared to the clothing stores. Enjoy the food, the walk, and the window shopping.",BrendaM64795
40,Fun to stroll thru,"This is a shoppers haven! But u must have lots of money, not for the average shopper. Very high end stores. We honestly just walked around and took pictures. Just as much fun! You dint have to have Rodeo Drive money to enjoy Rodeo Drive. Plus you wont be the only one...there are lots of tourists!",Sarah W
50,"Take a walk, take a deep pocket",There are many shops that are all high end and extremely expensive but Rodeo Drive is known for this. We enjoyed our walk and spent time in many stores which we were welcomed in each by the staff with bottled water and offered assistance while shopping. This is a mini Paris or mini Vegas for the shopping experts!,Jody T
40,Luxurious,Not bad at all! With all the luxurious cars! It need more public transportation! The buses are so complicated and not visible at all!,Yen N.
50,Walking with the Stars,"Rodeo Drive is amazing. Of course you need a lot money to purchase the things you dream of having; but, it is fun to window shop.",Spiderlaw
40,Its worth a few hours...not more!,"Rodeo Drive is Rodeo Drive. Gorgeous, fancy stores...and loads of tourists walking around. I walked into some shops, and for the most part they were empty...but they are just as gorgeous as the shops in NYC, Paris, or any other great big city! I think Rodeo Drive is more because of ""Hollywood"" feeling, but that might be it...the side streets are much better and better shopping! MUCH BETTER! I did see some celebs on the side streets...its worth a few hours to just say you did it!",Van10mbaum
40,Rodeo!,"Rodeo drive is a place you might want to visit if you never have. Window shopping is what people primarily do, due to the luxury stores in the area, the walkways are filled with tourists, which is expected. Parking is very accessible and inexpensive. The Beverly Hills Parks is not far away, and we enjoyed seeing all the fancy luxurious vehicles!",Claudia T
40,"Leisurely walking, window shopping, people watching","If you like to mozy along window shopping, watching people going hither & yon, some wearing bizarre clothing, this is a good place for you. Expensive shops abound, as do ""California people"". In some ways this is entertaining. Give it a try if you have time.",Sewbluecat
50,Well worth a day trip,Whether you have the money to spend or just want to window shop either way it is fantastic it has everything. I would say this is better for adults rather than you g families as it can be tiring. Enjoy.,Chantelle H
40,All tourists so far,"Yes, every high end shop you can imagine is here. Yes, most seemed empty. No, we didn't see any movie or TV stars. All we saw were tourists gawking and taking pics. I did go into Saks on Wilshire and , yes, they were snobby. One street over is Gap and common folk stores.",RinTulsa
40,Iconic street but I thought it would be longer!,"This is the absolute height of luxury along with the 'other' streets at a similar level: Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and 5th Avenue in NYC. By far, this street has the BEST view of luxurious vehicles driving around! The shops are beautiful and flagships of the respective category. Bring your credit card because your wallet cannot fit enough cash. I highly recommend at least a drive along this street though.",Douglas P
40,Always a fun visit,Always like to wander around Rodeo Drive when in LA. Fun to see the top end shops and pick up a surprising occasional bargain.,Davemc60
30,Judged and Ignored,"Yes - be prepared to be judged. Looked up from head to toe and stereo typed.Yes I am a tourist....and if you work in this area, you need to be prepared that you will have a lot of people, just like me wander your street.It didn't matter what store I walked into, because I had children with me and clearly not dressed as though I would probably buy anything from their store, (dressed comfortable for walking) I was consistently ignored and not given any assistance.It was disappointing considering that as tourists, we are here to spend but as it was portrayed in that movie all of those years ago....it is lives by that name!Saying that through........the street was very well maintained.A bit of a novelty, but would not spend more than an hour walking up and down this street. Just rude sales assistants and locals, even expecting my husband to hold the door open for one lady to exit a store without even a thank you!Never again!!!",Maria T
40,Pretty Woman,"Mainly for my girlfriend to see the Pretty Woman area. Also a quick walk to the Beverly Hills sign. Lovely area but expensive, high end shops. You will see some amazing cars too.",Greig B
50,A Great Walk,"We walked along Rodeo Drive and spent a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours window shopping & trying. We were very tempted by a couple of things, especially picture in one of the galleries but decided that it might well prove to be a ""holiday folly"" so managed to resist temptation. A great way to while away a couple of hours, but leave the credit cards in the Hotel!",Anthony L
40,Very expensive but free to see!,Every store is $$$$ but it's cool to see and people watch. If you like high end shopping then you'll be in heaven. Same goes if you like beautiful cars. There are tons of them. It was fun to see but if you don't plan on shopping then it may be best to drive through.,Breen77
40,Great designer label shopping strip !,If you love the big brands and all things lavish then Rodeo drive is a must visit destination !A one stop strip with anything famous you can imagine......just make sure your cards are topped up !,The_Foodist_Theory
40,Slightly Overrated,"Visiting Rodeo drive was a cool experience, but was by no means one of my favourite parts of LA. The clothes were beautiful, but I was visiting as a student - seeing the shops was neat. However, there was no way I could afford to pay $10,000 for a dress. After a few shops I was a little bored. If you do have the budget for some shopping though I'd recommend setting aside at least a few hours so that you have enough time to look at all of the stores!",Laura M
50,The Beverly Hills You Might Want to See,"Rodeo Drive is a shopping street in Beverly Hills. It is very clean and very high-end, as expected. There is a lot of parking available, but it's valet-only. Not expensive though.So why I really liked this street, despite not being able to really shop here ($1000 shirts are not my cup of tea): it's because this is an authentic ultra-rich street that isn't walled off or separated in any way. When you walk here, you will likely be surrounded by tourists like yourself who want to see the street but can't afford to shop, so you will not feel like you don't belong. At the same time, it is obviously a real shopping street for the rich—otherwise the stores wouldn't be economically viable.Put together, these two factors can make you feel rich for just a short period. It makes you feel part of Beverly Hills, unlike other parts of the town/neighborhood which are isolated and not friendly to outsiders. If you're in LA, I definitely recommend coming here.",Ynhockey
50,Uh credit card villa,"Top of the line no discount mostly designer fare that occasionally has a celebrity visit. Most things are priced beyond their functionality but hey everyone should have at least one Louis Vuitton.I'd you're on a budget that is like most people this will be a window shopping cruise. If you're spending Luke there's no tomorrow, and there will be a tomorrow so keep that in mine, shop wisely. Some of the things are available at the outlets a lot cheaper.",RaifWolfe
40,Viva las vegas,It was where pretty woman was shot! A collection of very high end boutiques with amazing frontage and displays. Parking is valet but cheap. Well worth a visit Ps look out for shopping center behind the street!,MarcandLauraB
30,Why??,A lovely street with lots of lovely expensive shops but it seems nobody is buying anything . I didn't see any body with shopping bag .,Olivier C
40,A quick visit,Lots of tourist but very few shopping bags - How the other half live. Worth a wander but leave your wallet at base.,David B
50,Bring $$$$$,We loved window shopping along Rodeo Drive. Beautiful area and stores. We couldn't justify spending $5000 for a scarf but we sure enjoyed looking.,kloverfield
30,Just ok!,"Whilst the street itself is very pretty and lined with palm trees, unless you are overly impressed by high end shops that only the very rich or famous can afford to even enter, (and frankly you can see in many other big cities worldwide), then its not really got a lot more going for it. We went because we felt we ""had to"" whilst in LA! Dont know what we expected but a bit of a disappointment really.",llpasah
40,Fun but not what it used to be,"This famous little street is beautifully maintained and landscaped, lined with high-end boutiques on both sides and great for walking, window shopping and people watching. As to the latter, the place is packed with tourists, people with ""new money"" and flashy cars. All fun to experience once and then move on as restaurants and shops are overpriced and overrated and populated by jaded staff.",Arizona333
50,Shopping Central!,"My favorite place to shop in LA! Love it! For movie lovers, the ""Pretty Woman"" hotel is just down the street! Can't miss it! Beautiful, clean area also.",Isabella F
50,Shopping,"Rodeo Drive is the place to be with all their exquisite shopping. Every name you can think of is there. Valentino, Tiffany & Co. Prada, Jimmy Choo just to name a few. And not to mention to cars that were either parked or it felt likr they were just doing laps. Ferrari's, Lambo's, Bentley's, Mercedes, BMW'S every where. It was like they wrre a dime a dozen there were that many. Diffentley for the wealthy. Overall it was nice to see how they live.",Rina L

50,Chanel,I wanted to buy some things at Chanel. I knew this store would have everything I was interested in seeing.,ashlandmatt
40,If you have lots of money...,"Rodeo Drive is not for the faint of heart. Some stores are unavailable without an appointment, while others might as well be due to the prices or the lofty attitude of the sales staff. On the other hand, the chances of spotting a celebrity are pretty high. I usually take a walk on Rodeo Drive when I'm in LA and think about how the ""other half"" lives.",sabrinayb

50,Drive through Rodeo Drive,"Visiting this city you just cannot miss Rodeo Drive and the shop where "" Pretty Woman"" strolled in. Pretty exciting",KerryAna
40,Busy street.,Although this street is one of the most famous and contains all the top designer shops that you expect the surrounding streets are equally endowed with top designer shops and restaurants. We parked just off Santa Monica boulevard to see the Beverly Hills sign and then walked down Rodeo drive and the surrounding streets. But there are quite a few parking garages in the area to choose from if you need somewhere to park. Walking is definitely the best way to really see the area and gives you a chance to window shop if you desire or even to purchase. Worth a look.,Bfmcm
50,just cool,"Feels like a must see place in Los Angeles whether you can afford to shop or not. Many restaurants to choose from in the area as well as literally being able to have ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""",Beanz22

50,Guided Tour of Rodeo Drive - Don't Stare Please,"Our guided tour came through Bel Air and Beverly Hills past the Los Angeles Country Club, Wilshire Blvd, up to Rodeo Drive and SAKS, Neiman Marcus, Barney's, and the Rodeo Collection shops before turning towards Sunset.

50,Luxury indulgences,Since a kid I was fascinated with Julia Roberts shopping at the Rodeo Drive in Pretty woman and wanted to have a similar experience. Even though I didn't have the insane amount of money to spend but decided a bit of luxury indulgence.. The drive to Rodeo drive through the streets of Beverly Wood-shire was mesmerising as the area is so beautiful full of palms and big mansions... Perfect place to shop till you drop.. You have all the best of the best luxury brands to splurge on.. If you've got deep pockets that's the place for you to spend it all :)),Swati S

30,The famous shopping street in Beverley Hills,"Stopped by here whilst in Beverley Hills, due to the fact it is famous and wanted to tick it off the LA list. A street that contains many very expensive shops, with expensive cars parked outside. Apparently this is where the celebrities shop, so you may get lucky and see one. It is worth visiting and having a walk along it, just to say you've been there and done that",Andy
50,"Looking, dreaming.","This is a great place to just wander around and take in the sights. My husband and I found a high end pawn shop (not the one on TV!) which had some amazing items in the window, we just generally pottered about, looking at everything. It was a beautiful sunny day, with a cool breeze, we lunched at The Cheesecake Factory (separate review) which was great.",DeeDeeCee
50,Fabulous,It's an experience of the wealthy beyond what I have ever seen at home. The store clerks are super nice! I bought a Gucci purse and the man that helped us took us upstairs for a tour on the rooftop. That's where the stars shop privately. Thanks Peter for making purse buying extra special! No one was snobby and treated us great. I live in Nashville and our nice mall treats you awful if you don't look rich. I hate shopping there for that reason. Not Rodoe Drive they treat you great even if you can't buy a $625 t shirt.,lyyoung
40,Very Clean,It was amazing how clean they keep this area. Top notch stores. Walking it during the day is easier than in the evening because it gets pretty crowded with after work crowd/diners.,ChefMEK
30,Lots of swanky shops,"This place is iconic, known from so many films and tv shows. It's great for window shopping in all the expensive outlets but in reality you're unlikely to buy anything there unless you're super rich!",Sarsywarsy

50,Even after you have seen it still no place like Rodeo Drive,"Although we have visited Beverly Hills several times we are still amazed by Rodeo Drive.

30,Night tour of Rodeo,"This section of LA is everything you've heard. We were on a night tour and didn't get to go in the stores because they were closed. However, the guide parked and let us do some window shopping. If I had to discribe the area I world say it's like a little town all of its own.",Shary A
30,Hmmm,Nothing much to do here just some picturesque corners of the city with very expensive stores and cars. We did find a spot looked liked an old alley where you can find wifi and coffee for 12 bucks,vlad0930
40,Totally as expected,"Following a quick tour in Beverly Hills, we end up walking on Rodeo Drive. As much I was disappointed with Hollywood Blvd, I was very please to see this place as good as expected.

30,Rodeo Drive,At least do the drive up and down Rodeo Drive and view the luxury shops. You may never buy anything but if you go to Beverley Hills it is something that you don't want to leave out of your itinerary. The shops are luxury brand names and the strip is not very long. You can walk it. I was on your but also walked up part of it.,Jennifer U

50,The Rodeo Drive,"Although it's only a street, but it's one of the most famous ones in the world and maybe the most luxurious one featured in movies for brands shopping (Versace, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel..) and those famous stairs at the end of it.. i think they were featured in some movies",Rania H
50,Must go,Windowshopping your little heart bear. You will find some good deals once in a blue moon. You can get ideas of passion from every single store. You like something you can pay top dollar for it. But it will be in the color you like the size and the model for you. Not every store will have it it will be one of a kind. So it will work. You will love the place. Make sure to take your wallet with you.,Eddie Whittier

30,Drive by,Most shops close by 6 p.m. Have to see once in your life. Lots of high end cars drive by too. Fun to look in the shops.,Diane F
30,Nice area but too expensive,First off I'm a single guy and honestly not all that into shopping. Yes the areas very nice and upscale. However everything's way over priced so if you can't afford it there's not much to do than just look. The sales people don't care for that. We didn't see anyone famous but there was free two hour parking in the public garages.,Banny9949
50,shopping heaven,Bring your wallet. Cartier Chanel and many others are waiting for you.The locals don't shop there but even window shopping is fun,Gail M
40,I felt like a Hollywood star. LOL,"First of all, Driving around Beverly Hills was crazy busy! Lots of people, narrowed streets filled with cars! (expensive cars HAHA) Finding an indoor parking was tough so we just parked at the streets; behind the Mercedes Benz dealer. We arrived around 4:30PM and we stayed till 6PM; it was cheap parking we only paid $1.25 so it was not bad.If you parked on the streets, it was REALLY HARD to find bathrooms. LOL.Instead of walking, we uber-ed to get to Rodeo Drive. We walked couple blocks and there it is, the beautiful and luxurious Rodeo Drive.There was an event (I think it’s CHEF LA something like that) so the main streets are occupied and being prepped but the side walk was fine. I must say it is definitely a high class-rich-luxurious outdoor mall strip.Overall I had a great experience walking around and window-shopping HAHA. As my budget wouldn’t allow me to spend luxuriously ATM ;)I recommend you visit this area if you are around LA. I did not buy anything but I felt like a superstar walking around this area ;)",Abigail I
20,"If you aren't rich, stay away","Most store owners were pretty judgemental of my friend and I right away. My guess is they assumed we couldn't afford anything in the stores.

40,Glitz galore,Take one of the LA metro buses down to Beverly Hills and experience the glitz and glamour of one of the most iconic areas of the city.People watching is so easy to do here and if you have the time..it's not too hard to find somewhere reasonable for lunch or dinner.,philbern
40,Rodeo Drive is a Fun Visit while in Town,"Don't bother with a trolley, if you can walk. It is not that long, a few blocks and a good portion is one block. They have great stores for window shopping and wonderful little restaurants for dinning out side to just watch the people go by. It is something you will want to do when visiting. It is tourist friendly. If you can walk, park at Nieman's on Wilshire Blvd.--when you are done for the day, buy something there and they will validate you so you don't just toss money for parking. Have fun.",elizabethlascheid
50,Impressive shops!,"You will see the most glamorous shops never seen. Of course, don't look at the prices, or you might have a heart attack, but well worth to have a wonder around in the afternoon. You might even bump into a celebrity or two.",Dani P
30,Don't take the wife!!!,"Wow,just looking in the shops I got a nosebleed,astronomical prices,not the place Joe Public would,or could shop at.Lovely street to walk down,high end cars line the street,just one of those places you can just look,sigh,and tell people you've been there.",IAN W
40,People watching spot,This shopping strip is full of the best brands in the world & attracts the Jetset from around the globe . I doubt locals would frequent this spot . Also lots of fancy cars to be seen in outrageous colours for maximum attention . Prices are out this world as well but great fashion Mecca .,selwyn a
50,"Cool place to visit, but avoid the free skin care samples.....total scam","Totally enjoyed seeing how the other half lives. Looking in the shops was a fun experience to see how the rich waste their money. One thing to certainly avoid, if given a free wrinkle/skin care sample RUN. Total scam, they have a semi good product that does help with wrinkles but only for about 20 minutes. So many people have been scammed by this for hundreds of dollars with their hard sell. AVOID>",KarenConaway
40,Bit of a hype train,We had to visit just to see what all the fuss was about. The street is in immaculate condition and the shops are all high end. It's a nice walk especially in the sunshine.,M15KY
50,What's Not to Like?,"Exclusive, atmospheric, fantastic people watching, stunning window dressing, just a very special experience. You have to do this when in LA - even just for window shopping. Soak in the experience...",gamahoz
50,Makes for a fabulous day of window shopping!,"Let's be honest, most of us can't really afford to SHOP on Rodeo Drive but we can all afford to window shop and treat ourselves to some lunch right? What used to be a very small section of Beverly Hills has expanded quite a bit. Now you can spend countless hours walking in and out of boutiques such as Channel, Gucci, Giorgio Armani, Vera Wang, Bvlgari, Cartier, Dior, Harry Winston, Prada, Versace and many many more. After all that window shopping (and possibly a splurge if your bank account allows it), you can treat yourself to some tasty lunch at 208 Rodeo. Be sure to ask for a patio seat so you can people watch. Fantastic! You can find garage parking for very cheap and spend all day here. Very upscale. You can walk across the street and enjoy several green belts full of flowers,trees and fountains as well. While I personally would not be able to actually shop here on any sort of regular basis, it sure makes for an enjoyable afternoon.",Sally M
40,Wow,I wasn't sure about visiting Rodeo Drive but I enjoyed it very much. Decadence overload. Expensive vehicles and shops everywhere. Not a place you would visit a lot of times but a must see one time for sure,Jewelz1976
40,Very clean and 'pretty' road,It was way better than I had thought from seeing it in the movies. Pretty and full of flowers all along the roadside. The shops were well out of my price range but it was interesting to see.,Sarah T
50,Rich Shopping Heaven,"While in LA got to spend a short amount of time here.There are a lot of of very high end and expensive shops for the rich & famous. But you will find brands that you know like Guess along with Tiffany & Co, so there is a chance for non rich to buy themselves something from Rodeo Drive.While walking along the drive you will see lots of tourist buses and fancy cars.To get there from Hollywood a taxi ride is about $20 depending on traffic.",torz70
30,Overrated,Why ? More sightseeing than shopping . Obscure brands everywhere . The good thing is that parking is easy and free in the neighbourhood.,Patrick B
40,Good to window shop,"If visiting LA and in need of retail therapy, and you have deep wallets then visit. If you are travelling around then you can get a bit blase with yet another high end store one after the other. However in the area there are other options as well. Did find it difficult walking around just to find a bar to sit down with a drink.",ruffwood1
40,An amazing collection of designer stores,"This is a fun place to people watch and to check out all of the designer stores. A collection of stores like this is really unique. Take a stroll down Rodeo Drive and enjoy the sights (designer stores, very fancy cars and the people). If you're visiting around lunch, there are many different options to pick from as well. While most visitors including us won't make any purchases in the stores located here, it's still worth taking the time to walk around and take it all in and check it off the bucket list.",ssy24
50,Visit Rodeo Dr!,"It's a great place to walk around high end stores. Take the time to visit, it's worth it even if you don;t buy anything.

Not here! Every language and nationality busy helping the US economy. Conspicuous consumption at its best.",PlatinumHoney
50,Top of the shopping pops,"Rodeo Drive is a very high end outdoor shopping mall, or should we say street, or even lane. Some of the shops stock things that only millionaires could afford.

The watches were selling for between $500k and $1.2 mil.",therealmccoy689
40,exactly what one would suspect - $$$,"Great shopping for those on a budget... different than my own. Streets lined with Lambos and Maseratis, fine dining, sparkling white teeth on every smile, and clothes and jewelers galore. It's a nice walk-through for the rest of us.",Shane P
50,Rodeo is a must!,"Just walking down the street and remembering the scene from Pretty Woman is worth the visit, but exploring your favorite designer's shop, grabbing a coffee or lunch, trying one of the fabulous Beverly Hills cupcakes, fabulous people watching, fast expensive car gawking or just strolling to get steps on you Fitbit - you won't be disappointed!",DeRiz

50,Was very insecure for no reason,"So after years of anticipating that Beverley hills was only for the rich and super rich, we went and was very apprehensive.After going into a few stores we realized how professional and polite everyone was and that the prices were not so crazy, we found a little bar at the end of the strip and sat and had a few drinks.Well worth a visit.",Nazandkate
50,fantatstic shops,you cannot go to LA without visiting rodeo drive fantastic shops great atmosphere every shop staff are so friendly and attentive,george m
30,A must for a photo but not what it used to be,"The problem with Rodeo Drive is that the world is now so global, it has nothing new to offer in terms of the shopping experience. There are few if any new brands to see, and you an have the same shopping experience almost anywhere in the world.The differences are that shoppers do spend here. The quality, and calibre of bags, shoes and garments is higher and more extensive than in many other global locations, as people here buy big.This can be seen most keenly at Cartier, where the diamonds and rocks on offer are far larger than in the Singapore or Sydney stores.It is still a fun walk, but not what it was back in the day.",Renae Leith-Manos
50,Fun Day Shopping,"My girlfriend and I spent the day shopping in the Rodeo Drive and nearby areas. She was a bit concerned that it was too upscale for her budget, but there is something for everyone. Certainly the haute couture is found here, but also stores like Crate & Barrel and BCBG, etc. My favorite is Zadig & Voltaire and the girls working there couldn't have been nicer! We ended the day sitting outside the coffee and tea shop people watching. Public parking in the lot was plentiful and inexpensive (on a Sunday).",AngelaJeanne
40,"Fabulous, depends on what you're there for!","This is a fun place for tourists to take photos and walk around.Most of the stores are very high end, so for the average citizen this is more of a looky-loo shopping experience.

40,Great fun if you love the glamour of Beverly Hills,"Such a beautiful street! Obviously perfect for high end shopping, but even if you're not buying anything, it's fun just to walk down and sightsee.

30,Not much to see,"We took the hollywood tour bus that,went to all the star homes, Beverly hills, the sign, was definitely worth the money! When we stopped hear at Rodeo Drive I was not impressed all it really is was maybe a handful of people who were shopping in a over priced store, that,almost looked as if I could go to the mall and buy it in every color. The only thing that was close to being impressive was the car's that were parked on the side of the road. I mean I can say,ive been and see it took some.pictures but def not somthing I would be happy or excited to go back to.",Ccraig0003
40,Much smaller than expected.,"When the taxi driver said we had arrived I was looking around and thinking he must have made a mistake.Rodeo Drive is literally a drive with a slop with lots of expensive shops. You literally walked up and around and down some steps. Much smaller than expected.As small as it was, it was full of happy tourist snapping away with their phones and cameras. Don't think anyone bothered buying anything from the shops; there were no prices and the saying is; ""if you have to ask then you can't afford it.""Anyway, it was worth a visit and you can say to your friends you've been to Rodeo Drive.",Conceptzwo
40,Great fun to explore and shop,"Been to Rodeo Drive a couple of times on L.A. trips. First time just stayed on Rodeo and window shopped, but there is a lot to see on North Beverly that is more affordable, and Nate'n Al's deli was perfect for lunch on my own.",Mary R.

40,"Nice, clean, interesting, expensive.","Clearly, Rodeo Drive shows up as one of the must see sites in Beverly Hills, and it is certainly worth a walk for some shopping. I found it an interesting place to walk around and poke in a few stores, but it is an overpriced shopping destination in my mind, although there are certainly some very nice stores.

10,Nothing special!,"Just a lot of mostly international chains like Gucci, Tiffany, Tory Burch, Chanel etc. you can find the same stores in Hong Kong, New York, Palm Beach. Bentley, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes abound. I was hoping for something unique!",Carol M
30,Nice to see once,"We drove from the valley to show some friends Rodeo Drive and they were impressed seeing it in person for the first time. However, they weren't quite as impressed as they thought they would be after having seen it on TV.",nbmiami
30,High end shopping trip,Rodeo drove was okay. After living in Asia and a bit spoilt for access to high end stores I found it just okay. I prefer to shop for more eccentric unique things but rodeo is good for Ralph Lauren and brooks brothers and other quintessentially American brands. Tom ford store was special.,m5carter
30,Good for shopping,"Obviously this place is a shopping dream, but a lot of tourist think they'll a lot of celebrities walking around....that's not normally the case. They are more often seen on Robertson then Rodeo. But with that said, if you're looking to impress your wife and you're in LA, hit this spot up.",nzamucen
20,Boring,No interesting shops. Not particularly attractive. Not even the best rich person shopping street. Disappointing.,Paul D
10,Nice but a JOKE,This was hilarious!!! I seen this in movies and people hype it up so much! Can we say overrated! There is less than 30 high end stores. This is 1/2 a block. I rather shop at Phipps Plaza in ATL! I am glad I got to see the hype though,Ms.Moore
40,Lots of walking but fun to see this historic place,"Always fun to see places in person that are historic in movies and locally. Great picture spots. We were on a private tour so we parked and had to walk to rodeo drive, walked about 45 minutes to hour total.",Rhonda F
40,"Hangin out with the ""rich people""",I thought walking down the street of luxury stores was great. We parked at a lot that was $2.75 per 15 minutes then later saw you could do coin operated on the street for the time we was there . Which was just to get a few pix . If you are able to afford the thousands of dollars clothes and jewelry then great but we went just to see and document with photo.,Belinda K
50,Great for morning run,"Had the pleasure to stay nearby and did 3 great morning run on rodeo drive (bottom to top near Beverly Hills Hotel and back - about 5K). Very quiet in the morning before 9 am, you have the pleasure to have the street just to you and admire all the glitch and glamour without spending a penny. If you feel like a local, stop at the local coffee at the end of your run to look at the street coming alive.",YULSYD
10,How Boring,"Was really excited to visit Rodeo Drive. What a waste of time. Cab driver didn't even know where it was (his fault)! Shops were massively overpriced, and street was so quiet, almost like a ghost town.",JJ1Brisbane
50,Grazy place,If you near by you have to go to Rodeo Drive. If you like to see how the upper class is living this is the place.Nice boutiques. Friendly people and more expensive cars on the road like every where else .Once in your life time you have to go to Beverly Hills.,Mumpfie
40,Nice,"This is a very nice street with lots of stores, also very good outdoor restaurant . You could shop very expensive or visit the main brand.",JPN65Montreal_Canada
50,Nice shopping area,"It's a nice shopping area, good for stroll up and down the street. It's just one street thou , kind of disappointing. I though it would be more than that . It's like a smaller version of Michigan avenue / oak street in Chicago with all the nice stores jammed packed very tightly.",annafromcgicago
40,Just Took A Walk,"We had time to kill in the area, and tried to make the most of it, so we figured we had to at least see Rodeo Drive. Definitely a nice area. We walked down and back a couple blocks, nothing that really blew you away, apart from the plethora of highly priced cars parked and driving along the street. It was a beautiful day, so it was nice to get some sunshine, exercise, and people/car watch.",Kyle A
50,Makes you smile,I have to say that no trip to la is complete without a walk down rodeo drive. If only to think of Pretty Woman. Some of the fashions are laughable and weird to say the least but the area is lovely and clean and a must to do. I haven't seen anyone famous there yet! 😄,Love To Travel
50,Best way to feel good.,"Is to go Rodeo Dr. The air is so clean, the people are so beautiful, and the shopping is to die for. However if all of this sounds like to much for you I would recommend doing some Hollywood Sightseeing in one of those Open Bus Tours.",Tony T
40,Good for an afternoon stroll,We spent time on a Sunday afternoon strolling this and adjoining roads. Worth a visit of only to window shop or people watch,Sarah J
30,Nothing speciak,"If you are looking for expensive places you found it. You can remember some movies, see nice and famous stores, nice cars everywhere...just nice.",Diego L
30,Window shopping only!!,If you want to go to this street to see the super high end shops this is the place to go. T-shirts will cost you $1000 in Vera Wang.,jmarkpatton
40,People watching,"Definitely a people watching area, good shopping And restraunts to enjoy.Nice area for bars and relaxation. Always the odd celebrity to look out for! If you can recognise them.",Phil B
40,Life styles of the rich and famous,See how the other half liveWant to go somewhere to feel poor go here. This was on my wifes to do list. We arrived and parked at the Top of Rodeo drive. Making our way on foot down the street was slightly depressing. The cars travelling up and down the road and parked up were about as expensive as a cheap house. If your into cars and want a good perve just stand on the side of the road and drool for hours. As you walk along keep an eye out for the gold fire hydrants on the side of buildings. Looking into he store windows seeing all the things that a lot of money could buy was interesting. If you have the money go crazy and shop if not go buy a souvenir from some cheap shop. Head to the end of the road to see the Beverly Hills Hotel (Pretty Woman).,benbencor
50,What to Know Where the Rich Shop?,Rodeo Drive has some of the most expensive shopping around from clothing and jewelry. I walked into a jewelry store and looked at a one million dollar diamond necklace.,Dr. David
30,Nice to See,"It's a nice place to see, but personally I think anyone who shops here is a moron. You can get the same stuff at any mall for less or online for even less than the mall price. Certainly worth a look because of the history of the area.",Mark P
30,Pretty fancy shopping,Rodeo drive is everything you expect it to be. Expensive and pretty flashy. Shops with size 0 shop assistants with chips on their shoulders. But again a must see while in LA,Kath D
50,Beautiful Area,"Rodeo Drive was a stop on tour of the LA area that we were on. We had enough time to walk by a few shops and I was able to pop in and buy some cologne. It is a very pretty, clean, and safe area. I expected to be able to do some more people watching but we were there in the middle of the day on a Thursday. It's a nice place to stop if you are in the area.",NYC2VA13
40,"Prefer it to 5th Ave, not to Worth Ave","Not as crowded with rude Chinese tourists as NYC, but dirtier and less refined than Palm Beach... got some shoe's and my wife a bag at Tod's they were great, 1st class. Will save my shopping for Worth Ave in the future.",1stclassticket
30,It's a road with shops,"Ok, so they're expensive shops, but most big cities have something similar. Was quite underwhelmed with it. Well kept and felt very safe unlike some other areas of LA.",Plane_Talking_Travel

40,Pretty woman all over...,"Walk in the glitz and glamor of all fine shops, palm trees and expensive cars. Keep in mind that there are also some more affordable shops in the streets around ...",Mats M
40,Pretty street with some fancy stores,"If you are in Beverly Hills, how can you not visit the famed Rodeo Drive. So we did...... Its a pretty street, lined with some fancy high-end stores but not all are so. There are some mid-range showrooms too.One can spend some time window shopping here or spend some more serious time doing real time shopping here and that's about it all ! ;-)",kent19
20,What a disappointment!,"So not as glamorous as the hype says it is. Some of the usual high end shops, but a block over is all the mediocre chain chops (Banana Republic, Gap, etc.). Having visited Worth Avenue in Palm Beach yearly, I have determined that it blows Rodeo Drive away--and Palm Beach vs. Beverly Hills does as well. Palm Beach area has so much charm and class. Worth Ave has so much character---little alley ways with cobblestone paths with specialty shops and cafes tucked away, ivy covered buidlings amidst the usual high end boutiques. For every name brand store on Worth Ave, there is a no name lovely boutique shop for a different shopping experience. Who wants to always see the same old stores? Rodeo Drive is a boring street with little charm.",kmb1970
50,Beautiful,As beautiful in the flesh as it is on TV. A real place of glamour and image - an amazing amount of wealth and affluence in one place... not for me but great to see how the other side live nonetheless.,BigBrank

40,Liked 2 hour free parking.,Lots of Parking and valet free for 2 hours. Great shopping and food. Super clean and a lot of very nice cars on the streets!,02shadow
40,Great shopping,Rodeo drive is a beautiful strip of designer shops and boutiques. It's nice to walk past all the stores and see the beautiful window displays. Not much mid range shops along this strip but in the area there are a few. Just wish they had more restaurant options along that strip.,Tricia L
20,"Well, window shopping",Short street overrated imo.. nice to be there tho but nothing really special in terms of shopping... Go Melrose Ave for more choices...,Andkayi
50,Best shopping,"This street is very nice, almost every store here is high end clothing and bags with high prices but it's worth go there for a walk.It is very well maintained and there are lots of peoples.Also a very good place to see amazing cars on the street",Alex B
50,Gorgeous,Where all the expensive shops live! Such a beautiful street and Right at the end is the hotel that pretty woman was filmed in ( purple and white outside it),Lindsay C
50,Glamour is Hollywood landmark,"Rodeo drive is just like what we all have seen in movies and TV series, only better and more striking. This is because suddenly an image becomes reality and there fore much more powerful. On Rodeo drive you will experience the feeling of luxury and lavish life but all is so incredibly glamour that in Hollywood even reality looks fake.",Aixois
30,Not all its cracked up to be,We live in Toronto and Rodeo Drive is no better or worse than Bloor Street/ Yorkville. Was surprised. Pretty with the pink spring blossoms but nothing special.,FunBobby298
50,A stroll down Rodeo Drive is a visual feast,I loved the energy of Rodeo Drive. Gorgeous shops and lots of feast your eyes on. Sparkling and wonderful. There are some beautiful shop fronts and some exquisite things to buy - well worth a visit,365giannad
50,Great shopping,"If you are into window shopping rodeo drive is the place to go. Most of the stores are very eclectic, but you can find Ralph Lauren, brooks brothers, and lots of handbag stores",danfriedmanmd
40,Very opulent,"Pronounced RODAO drive not the rodeo cowboy version.We kept being corrected by LA locals haha.Didn't buy anything as bank account did not stretch that far, but experience of visiting was an eye opener.",Gedski1212
50,Exactly as I remember,"This drive as not changed that much. It still has all the fancy cars driving up and down and celebrities dashing into stores.Nothing has changed the make up houses are still trying to pull you into their shops hoping to sell you their product.I tried to find a frozen yogurt store that I had my very first frozen yogurt ice cream from but I think it may have moved one road back as it may not have been able to pay its rental, which I expect is a sweet fortune. ""What a pity""",Chantellehowes
40,Is this a movie set??,"A mecca for travellers and seems a bit fake, like a movie set. All the big designer names on a painfully tidy street with neat palms and ubiquitous Porsches, Rolls and Mercedes. Totally unaffordable and not hip. Try Venice beach or Melrose avenue instead",gillofonslowst
40,Its okay just to say you've been....,If you come here you have to come before 6pm as everything closes around that time. Besides the fancy stores there is nothing more to do. Rodeo Drive is only a few blocks. Not for kids or small children.,Gregg A
50,A LA site to be seen,"Good shopping, clean streets, no riffraff. If you don't intend to shop, it is still nice to see and explore. Many cool restaurants, dessert and coffee places. Parking reasonable on street with meters. I like that they take credit card since I never carry change anymore.",Spoonermomma1
30,Nice to see how the other 1% live!,"Interesting to see this area but well above my spending threshold! Oh well maybe someday I can afford to park my car here, let alone shop!",nhrelp
50,Wealth display,"Whether you buy anything in those fancy stores of Rodeo Drive, it is worth a visit to this very cheerful segment of Beverly Hills. If on a budget there are places nearby that won't bankrupt you. But Rodeo Drive is a lot about people watching, and that is free. For many people Rodeo drive represents where they would go shopping when their fortunes in life have improved, for others it is a superficial way of life, a hyperbolic image of consumerism. Regardless of one's opinion, Rodeo is a must destination when visiting Southern California, particularly so during Christmas time when the blocks between Santa Monica Blvd and Wishire Blvd are lighted with fine Baccarat crystal chandeliers, and the whole place is pure magic.",BGBeverlyhills
50,The place to visit in LA,A must see place you always see on TV. Great people watching and for those who can afford it an expensive place to shop,Robert P
50,Must see,Ok. Maybe you think since you are going to do any shopping you should skip this. Wrong. The store facade here is the main attraction. The street is superb both in store design and architecture. A must see.,Me74126500
40,Good to say you've been,Went here as we were in LA. If your into extravagant shops and shopping or people watching it's up your ally. I personally found it a bit boring although we did see some very unique cars.,Brendan B

50,Awesome,"What a great place, how the rich and famous live! This place is just like the movies and it is an excellent place to visit and have a stroll around. Highly recommended.",PNMO1978
30,Shop (or at least window shop) where the wealthy do...,"This area gets a ton of tourist traffic. Just fun to see all of the high end designers from Ferragamo to Tom Ford in one place. Very pretentious at first glance outside of the visitor traffic. If you're not too afrais to walk into the stores, some of the staff seem a little less friendly depending on the store. The Coach staff are wonderful and very down to earth for example, but just walking past some stores (that shall remain nameless), you get strange glances or feel as if you're being sized up based on your appearance. No parking on the actual Via Rodeo, but parking is available in multiple side streets. Overall, nice to ride through if you're in Beverly Hills, or stop and window (or truly shop).",Jay Lo

50,Window shopping!,"Had 1 day to sightsee in Hollywood and decided to end our day with a visit to Rodeo Drive. Found a small underground parking lot across from Hugo Boss at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, most of the shops had already closed or were closing soon so we just did a little window shopping and then had dinner at Fleming’s - note there are only a few restaurants in the area - if you are looking for something reasonably priced, there is a Cheesecake Factory nearby. While we thought we were prepared for the high prices of the merchandise, it was still eye-popping! Good experience to window shop like the rich and famous!",EaglesFan11

40,About the only place in LA you want to walk,"Rodeo drive is perfect for window shopping and a relatively small street. What I found most surprising was how little I wanted to walk anywhere else in LA after walking the streets here.Rodeo drive is pleasant, clean and easy. Everyone is friendly and easy going. The Italian restaurants in the area are devine, the coffee is great but expensive.As an Australian I loved it and walking the area really gave me that Californian buzz that was lost in Hollywood",JS5071
40,High End Stores Looked a Little Lonely,"Since I visited in early March, it was delightful to window shop and also to venture into the exquisite high-end stores. The sales help was extremely friendly and while the other customers were sparse. I wondered where the Beverly Hills Cops were when super loud cars almost drag raced up and down the street. I would have loved to see one pulled over. It certainly doesn't fit the style and character of Beverly Hills. Saks and Niemans are also not to be missed as well as other stores adjacent to Rodeo Drive.",Petra F

The stores are high-end. We shop in NYC, at similar stores, but in Beverly Hills, the clerks seem to have an attitude problem. It's fun to look around and grab a coffee, but I prefer 5th Avenue and SoHo.",Mommabiek
40,must see in Beverly Hills,"You can't go to Beverly Hills without going to Rodeo Drive. It has all the high end stores like Prada, Chanel, etc. Of course you see all the nice cars parked around, Ferraris, Bugattis, etc. Fun to people watch but the stores can be found at other big cities.

If you want to impress your friends back home with a Gucci bag from Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, this is your place.It is a decent place for people watching but usually tourists watching other tourists.My suggestion is if you are going for the high end shopping go to Santa Monica Place. If you are going to tell your friends back home that you went then you will have to go.",Morris K
30,Over-rated,Rodeo Drive is nothing more than a tourist spot for window shopping at over-priced stores and pretentious restaurants. Take a pass and check out some of the area's smaller neighborhoods for boutique shopping and funky cafes with outdoor dining.,Robyn P
30,Great place for window shopping,"If you want to see how the other half lives, stroll along Rodeo Drive. You see regular to super rare items on sale. Most stores have no price on any item, they say. ""If you have to ask for the price, most likely you cant afford it"". Park towards the north part of Rodeo drive. Look online for the catholic church near by, lots of public fee parking. A short walk to Rodeo Drive.",lxjuarez
40,Iconic luxury designer shopping street,"Visually much better than I expected. North Rodeo Drive is a lovely wide, palm lined street between Wilshire Blvd and Santa Monica Blvd. However, as with most iconic shopping streets in the major cities now, the feel is quite 'vanilla' and very expensive. Full of all the standard high end luxury designer brands (Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Celine etc). I went during the week and the street was very quiet except for a few tourists like myself. If you are not intending to go shopping in the luxury brand stores, then you only need about 10 minutes to walk up and down the street. If you are a fashion and department store lover, I would recommend ticking Rodeo Drive off your list and then wander around the upscale department stores on Wilshire Blvd (Barney's is just gorgeous). Other more affordably priced retail stores are located on the surrounding streets such as Beverly Drive. There is also some interesting architecture nearby like the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and the Bank of America building (the first high rise built in the area).Visited February 2016.",Alison P

50,THE EXTREME DIVIDE OF RICH AND HOMELESS,"LA is a town of extremes and the Rodeo Drive is the perfect example. The 2mile long street exclusively in Beverley Hills occupied by the most and ultimate luxurious shops, restaurants and hotels in the world. Rodeo Dr resembles a 'faux-European shopping alley' and features a cobblestone ficus trees lined street, Rodeo Dr walk of style plaques set in the sidewalks and the famed, nude sculpture 'Torso' of world-renowned sculpturer, Robert Graham. It was New Year's day and Rodeo Dr was practically deserted except for the tourists and some diners as all shops were closed. It had an unreal feeling that one was strolling on a deserted elaborate movie set. My hubby's sigh of relief and nervous laughter were still echoing in my ears as we turned off Rodeo Dr and boarded the Metro shuttle bus.",connie l

50,High end shopping avenue,"As most of the reviews mentioned, it is place where you wish to shop but can only do window shop. The place is so well maintained that the retail salesman are better dressed than you are. My god! They were in shiniest of shoes and blackest of drapes. And, zero hair flying around. But, then that's part of their job and it includes ignoring tourist like us who are staring at their shops and windows. Lot of handsome and pretty people to look at to but not a place where you can just sit and do people watching. The place screams expensive.",Indu S

50,High class end shopping,"If you are visiting LA than you must put Rodeo Drive on your list of sightseeings. We made our own way there rather than doing a tour bus that way you take your time looking around and not worry about time restrictions. A beautiful place to visit and window shop. We spent half a day there and did the whole street on both sides. If you are a fan of the movie Pretty Woman than you will see the shop where she went in to buy her clothes. We all know that Rodeo Drive is for the rich and famous but that does not stop an ordinary person from visiting the place and looking around. Even though I couldn't afford anything from these shops it was still very nice to window shop . The sales staff in some of these shops were pleasant. Unfortunately I didn't see any celebrities or rich and famous people. There were a lot of luxurious cars parked in the street as well . The shops that you will see are the likes of Chanel, Cartier, Hermes, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Gucci, D & G, Dina Collection and the list goes on and on . There are a lot a restaurants as well. As it was in December the whole street was decorated with Christmas trees and lights etc and of course all the shops were decorated as well. It doesn't matter whether or not you can afford to buy anything from there you have to visit the place to see where the rich and famous shop.",Paulette A

50,Fabulous clean upmarket experience,"This was really great. Our chauffeur dropped us here for a while to check out the designer stores. Beautiful clothes of course but well over my budget. I found a fabulous coat but alas $8,400 was around 8,200 over my budget. The window displays are beautiful but i do think some of the salespeople behaved just as they were depicted in pretty woman and were quite snobby. Others were lovely but they clearly think because they work in Rodeo Drive they are a cut above the rest..I had a good time though😍",Lisa B
10,Get real people!,"Awful traffic, crowds everywhere all wanting to experience what it is like to be rich and stupid. Truly, if you are rich would you really want to shop in crowds? Yes there are some of the best luxury stores in the world but people let's get real and think to ourselves if we truly need a purse that costs the same price as someone's annual work salary? Buy a nice leather purse for a few hundred bucks then donate the rest of the money to charity. The definition of being truly rich is someone who gives to others in need.",FirstClass001
40,"Beautiful, but expensive","No visit to Beverly Hills is complete without a trip to Rodeo Drive.We visited during lead up to Christmas and it was lit up with the most exquisite Christmas decorations I have ever seen. It was eye candy.Unfortunately our budget did not extend to any Christmas shopping! The prices in the luxury stores are astronomical... $1,600 for a style check up which comes off the price if any clothes are purchased - a pair of jeans over $1,000!

50,Very cool,This just had to be done. If you like to people watch and don't mind looking at endless very expensive cars then you will like this street.

50,Love this its like a movie set,Located in Beverly Hills. Pretty woman hotel nearby which we went in and up to the top floor in the lift. Clean and rich. We went at Christmas. Christmas Swing music piped on the streets via speakers on lamp posts. The air seems as if it is scented. Shop staff surprisingly welcoming despite us just window shopping. Only one toy shop which was very dated and out of place.In general a very relaxed atmosphere.No price tags on anything as if you have to ask then you can't afford it.Loved this place. It was like a movie set especially as some of Hollywood is in stark contrast.Must visit.,AndyHouse
40,"Yes, you can buy a dress that costs more than your new car","An interesting experience, probably worth being in your top ten within the LA area, for a few reasons. You'll truly appreciate how absurd and outrageous the offerings and prices can be for things that you'd personally never buy. You'll probably see somebody famous buying one of them if you're pop culture literate. The lunch venues aren't as outrageous and make this a nice outing for a memory. And it's very clean/safe everywhere. (I wish some of the latter were exported to Hollywood)","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
30,More to say you were there...than being there itself.,It has a bunch of very expensive stores - and chandeliers as street lights. It is a picture of the 70's over spending and over the top design. I found it a place to check off my bucket list - but not more than that.,KerryZ35

40,Western Decadence at its finest,"Simply walking down the street will demonstrate the decadence and opulence of the region. From the cars parked, to the stores lining the drive, it is easy to see why there are no Wal-Mart's close by. A world of its own is what you will see.

If you want to see where the stars shop, head down here. Don't get me wrong, I couldn't afford to buy a thing down here, but if you want to see your share of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Bugattis, find a place to park and stroll around here for a bit. Grab a bite to eat and pretend like you are living the high life, even if you aren't. I took some teenagers down to Hollywood. They only wanted to spend a few minutes on Sunset, but loved strolling around here.",Robert W

If you've seen it on the films Pretty Woman and the like, and you are curious, then go have a look but be warned.....it's not for the light of wallet or the faint hearted of shoppers......if you are an officianado of Oxford street then save your pennies.....its massively expensive. Walk further afield there are cheaper options.As a tourist attraction though it's a must see if you are in LA.....take a few pictures, stroll up one side and down another and then find a cafe to sit and listen to the car horns and marvel at some of the worst driving outside of London or New YorkGo home with some happy memories, and tell the tale of how you pretended to be Richard Gere outside the Wiltshire 4 seasons",paraman97

40,very interesting place,"Interesting place that you see those WITH and those WITHOUT within blocks of each other. I wouldn't make this a destination, but if you're in the area it's worth the people watching.",mtodd54
30,Kitch,"It's only a rich district with a lot of fashion brand shops, luxurious cars around, groups of tourists taking pictures and videos.It is visited from a lot of guided tours, like Rastabus, especially from L.A. first time visitors.It's somewhat a must-see spot but nothing more unless you are fond of fashion or you have a lot of money to spend.I think it's rather not probable that I come back in this frick place.",Antonaino
30,Nice to see how the 1% shop,"A stroll along these few blocks will certainly open your eyes about how the rich and famous of LA like to waste their money. Everything here is so ridiculously priced high that it's funny and sad at the same time. Only people with money to burn would spend that kind of money on the items for sale here. It's the perfect example of how ""a fool and his money are soon parted"". It's a nice place to window shop but don't expect to be able to afford to buy anything.",Luv2travel_RS
30,Posh,"Very nice area,very expensive area also. I made the mistake of walking from Hollywood on a warm day. If you like buying designer labels come here, if not then its jyst like any other shopping street",Eoin P
40,Interesting love/hate experience,"In many ways Rodeo Drive is the epitome of all that is wrong with today's consumer culture, where luxury brands are worshipped and reverenced. At the same time it is also a beautiful and fascinating place packed with polished super-expensive shops. Don't expect to see any celebrities - I think the ratio of celebrities to tourists must be about 1 to a million or so.",Family_business
50,California's Fifth Ave,"If your here it's a must walk ! The people, place and experience of walking down Rodeo . You never know who is in the dressing room next to you or having brunch at many of the outdoor cafe's",lovliladi
40,Pricy Shopping.,"I expected it to be like New Yorks Fifth Avenue or Chicago's Magnificent mile but was a little disappointed. While the shops were juat as upscale if not more so. The strip was only a few blocks long and anti-climactic. Did love the oalm trees along the strip that the other 2 cities do not have. However, we did enjoy our trip to Rodeo Drive. Would go again if in the area.",Shirley C
40,Just like in the movies,"I've seen it in the movies so many times and to finally get there was fantastic. It's everything I imagine it to look like. All the high end brands are there, especially love the Chanel store. Unfortunately their prices are on the high end aswell compare to other Chanel stores. A stroll along the street is a must. A haven for car lovers since it's a mecca for convertibles and the ultra expensive cars to drives slowly by so everyone can see them. Unfortunately, I didn't spotted any celebrities on the day.",Celine142
30,Pretty nice,"It was quite nice to drive down this Drive and see the shops, the people and the cars that are around here.Worth having a look and perhaps if we'd had time walk along the streets and do a spot of people watching.",Mindy1001
50,Pretty Woman in the flesh,"It was quite amazing to drive down a street which has featured in so many movies. All the big names in fashion have shops here. It was interesting to see the different types of people walking about.For the car watchers, we had the following sightings in just a few minutes - one red Ferrarri, Porsches, Maseratti, Jaguars and a couple of Rolls Royce Silver Seraphs. The whole place just shouts wealth.",David T
50,Great place to maybe see a movie star:},"Again get your convertible and take a ride along this famous strip, you might even see a movie star, oh wait a REALITY star ha ha ha .....its a great strip for a cruise to see all there is to see on rodeo, but better yet is get out and walk....or take the trolley parking ai close to impossible. Enjoy.",SashasVilla
50,How the other half live!,"My wife and I booked a bus tour from 2nd street and Santa Monica in Santa Monica. The tour was approx 4hrs long, this took us all over the main attractions of LA.Rodeo Drive was one of the highlights, with its oppulence and grandeur, it certainly was an eye opener; informed how some shops have a waiting list to get inside, or how you need a $1,500 deposit to look into the shop, or how one shop has its own parking meter outside for its owners yellow Rolls Royce convertible.Definetly worth a visit.",Ray_Finkle_9
40,"Nice walk, pleasant and clean","Enjoy being there. Not ever going to shop there. Not worth the expense. However, beautiful stores look like mini museums. Clean, safe place.

40,Great for people watching !,"A lot of fun to stroll Rodeo Drive - see the things you've seen in the magazines, do a little shopping all the while seeing beautiful people and cars!",Michelle C
30,Mildly interesting,Walking around was mildly interesting to see all of the big name shops and my husband liked seeing some great cars but that was it. Would be great for high end shopping's for sightseeing it isn't that exciting,Essa
40,Fashion Lover's Paradise,Even if you can't afford a key chain at Louis Vuitton; if you love fashion you can't miss this. Just window shopping is enough for any fashion lover. A fun way to spend some time while in Beverly Hills. We walked from the Beverly Hills Hotel and passed some spectacular homes along the way as well.,pugmom61

50,You'll be seeing stars!,"Drive down this hotsy-totsy street and you are guaranteed to spot someone you are sure is a celebrity. They are everywhere.

50,Best shopping with great refreshments,"How can you not enjoy shopping with some of the nicest stores as well as relax with some great food and drinks. Enjoy the sun, shade and the sites and sounds. The douche bags are endless...that is always fun to grab a bench and just giggle the hours away.",Philip D
50,Heck it's only 3 blocks of the most luxurious shopping and hotels in the world,Come see the movie stars spend their money . Wow cars and drivers . The best of the best if you are anybody in fashion you must have a store here . Don't look at the price tags with a weak heart . Yes you can go into the stores and yes they may talk to you ...Still worth a visit .,jft310
50,"Mastros - Amazing food, take a flash light!!!",Wonderful meal in Beverly Hills Mastro's. Quite possibly the best steak we've ever had. As it was our honeymoon they brought out a complimentary desert which was outstanding.Service was second to none and we were made to feel very special.The establishment is set over three floors with differing layouts depending on your choice of evening. We will be going back there when we travel to LA next year.,DBateman1980
30,Not all that,Rodeo drive is quite small and unimpressive considering all the hype it gets. Few stores you can get in any high end mall and quite deserted,Missytikal
50,Seeing it on TV does it no justice. Must see up close and personal.,"On vacation from Florida this was something we just had to see. Much larger in real life than envisioned on TV and in the movies. The stores, the glamor and endless fancy cars. Trendy people and even movie stars mingling with the crowds. If you've ever imagined it, you must take the walk down Rodeo Drive!",Bill M

30,Go once...,"OK, I'm cheating a bit cuz I was a local... Go see the infamous Rodeo Drive just once cuz you won't shop (do that on Melrose), it's kinda like going to your grandmother's house where you couldn't touch anything, and truth is, they're the same elite shops you'll find in any Big City Shopperamia, with just one more multiple of markup in case you're tempted to actually touch something. Only the .01% actually buys anything, and that's during the sales, which don't really technically occur as far as the general populace is concerned. Save up for a parking place, pass on any pseudo ""shopping"", and people watch instead. Then go to Melrose to shop...",Steve O
50,A must to see in LA,You can live vicariously through others here or buy your way in with a credit card. The people and car viewing is remarkable. The stores are like in the movies very high end and pricey. But Coach bags and Jewelry here are priced not for the faint hearted.,DetroitCaribTraveler
10,Boring,"An overpowering collection of high end shops in an otherwise uninspiring setting, not really an inspiring place to visit",milktray
50,Southern visitor,My son and his girlfriend visited us from South Carolina. We brought them up here so she could see it. She had a big smile all the time she was here. Lots of famous stores and all the glitz of Beverly Hills.,10ringtraveler
50,Definitely worth visiting,"How could you visit LA and not see Rodeo Drive? Loved the shops here. Possibly slightly more stunning than in other cities. I love the designer stores elsewhere. My favourite store on this visit was Gucci, what fabulous frontage. Loved it, and it did not disappoint.",Jean H
50,Where the rich and famous come to shop,"You see Rodeo Drive in a lot of Movies, and it didn't disappoint. Yes its over priced. Yes its over the top. Its High Fashion at High Prices. But would you really have it any other way? If you've never been, you must go (at least once) Probably the cleanest street I've ever walked along.",Tristonford
50,You can eat off the floor.,"This place lives up to the excess it's known for.The stores are obnoxiously expensive and do not give a sense of ""come on in and see what's on our racks.""But...it's great eye candy.You see celebs every now and again. My favorite part is the car watching. This is exotic car heaven: Lambo's, Ferrari's, Rolls, Bentleys...the poor people drive Porsche's.The part that got me was how unbelievably clean the three main blocks are. When you cross over from the Beverly Wilshire hotel and stay to the right, there's a side street that leads up to the Porsche Design Store, a cafe and the Versace store. We were out there at about 11pm and it looked like the Venetian hotel in Vegas. Except the Venetian is made to look like an Italian street and is inside...this is the same except outside. There's no dirt...you could eat off the streets.The next morning we noticed there had to be 3 maintenance workers on every block...no less than 10-12 guys changing light bulbs, putting fresh paint down.Great place to waste a few hours, but the stores themselves can be seen on 5th Ave in NYC and any other major city.",PriorSafety
30,Not impressed,"Not as large as I had expected. After years of seeing this shopping area in movies, etc. I decided to check it out when I was in LA but there's not a lot there.",Michelle S

40,"Excessive, conspicuous consumption",How does the other half live?My grandmother always said some people had more money than sense and here is some of the world biggest conspicuous consumption. Outrageously priced stores and restaurants. Vastly expensive cars everywhere.,panpanda
50,Definitely a must-see when visiting LA!,"We loved walking up and down Rodeo Drive while visiting LA this past weekend. It's definitely a must-see... beautiful streets lined with high-end shops. Grab a drink or an appetizer at one of the many small restaurants and just people-watch. We saw the hotel from ""Pretty Woman"" and took a picture in front of the Beverly Hills sign. Fun afternoon!",Allie O
40,Chic & Small,"We drove by and saw their lovely stores, but I though the area would be much larger like in Europe. Very impressed with the looks of the Versace store, but hey they are Italians! Worth driving or walking around like many people do.",Route66travel
30,Never take a 13 year old to Rodeo Drive,"If you take a 13 year old to Rodeo Drive, make sure she is dressed for it. She may get cranky. She may feel like a real slashlepper compared to all the high end people she is seeing. On to the review: The people in Prada are very nice to you. The people in Yves Saint Laurent not so much. What astounds me is how full of themselves these high end retail sales people are. One thing I was disappointed in was the Coco Chanel store. It isn't the Coco Chanel of the past, in that they've evolved the style and frankly I did not like it. Stick with the tried-and-true folks. As far as the ambiance of walking up and down the street you will find a lot of tourists from different countries and that's always interesting to see if you are a people watcher. The girls in the Sephora store on Beverly Drive are very very friendly. We really enjoyed Beverly Drive. I highly recommend that in lieu of Rodeo Drive. It is just one street over.",Cyndy B
20,Boring,"Did a drive thru...no one on street as it was about 10am. Overall pretty boring looking at shops i will never go into to buy a $100,000 purse.",Kerry C
40,Iconic part of the city.,we had a quick walk round and had a Cheesecake at the Cheesecake Restaurant on Beverly Drive which was amazing. most expensive shop in the world on Rodeo Drive along with the hotel where the pretty woman film was set. didn't see many people in the shops and no stars but worth seeing just to experience how the other half live.,David C

50,Rodeo Drive,"It's just an amazing feeling to walk down Rodeo Drive (especially if you're an Entourage fan). Honestly, I grew up in the Valley (Burbank) and moved to Kansas City 25 years ago. So, going back to LA is very special for me. But, I've never spent a lot of time in Beverly Hills. This time, we spent a week at the Beverly Wilshire and there is no place like Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive. The restaurants are second to none - the shopping is amazing - and quite honestly, the people watching is unlike anywhere else on earth. Great time -",kjasoncarter23

Many of the travelers were pointing out famous people walking around. One couple even approached a female celebrity from a soap show (forget the name). Poor celebs, can't shop without being bothered, oh well, it goes with the territory of being in show biz.",Wayne F
50,FAB!!,Many years since I have visited here but it well worth returning for another look even though I didnt see any celebrities!!

30,Nothing special,"Nothing special or different from what you can see in every rich neighborhood of a big city. It is worth the visit if you want to give a face to the places you have been seeing in the famous movies and tv shows. Further, this place is much better than the close but dirty Hollywood. In fact it does not represent the real face of Los Angeles. By the way you can enjoy some good restaurants and a nice walk lloking at the big brand's stores.",Cristian M

50,Nice but not Cheap,"It was a great experience going past all those expensive stores and shopping there with my family but prices were very high but what could you expect from Beverly Hills. My kids mostly enjoyed shopping at Gucci,Louis Vuitton and Dior",juanglee_yuan

50,Got to be seen!,"One of the few places in LA that is what you expect. Just how you see in the movies. Designer shops, fast cars and well dressed elegant ladies. If you have a car then drive some of the streets around Rodeo Drive and take a look at the homes of the rich. Didn't get out to shop but enjoyed our drive through experience!",Sharon E
30,Good for window shopping,If you are looking for high end shopping then look no further. For most of us window shopping is all we could afford.,Russ1470
50,Not your everyday street,"Wonderful experience to walk Rodeo Drive with the family. The street lighting was even something to see, chandeliers in glass cases. Not your everyday street light. But that was Rodeo Drive - not your everyday experience. We have a lovely time window shopping and was a great part of our trip to LA.",Pitty604
30,Same stores as any big city but dressed in black & white,Rodeo Drive is the same as the main shopping district of any big city. The only difference is every store employee is wearing black & white and they seem completely unconcerned that no one has the intent to buy something. There is only one reason to visit here and that is to window shop and look at the fancy cars parked on the street. I suspect these are rented and parked there to cause a stir among the gawkers. I cannot imagine any self-respecting wealthy celebrity actually being seen here. This place is really a side-show more than anything and easily can spend an hour or so if you are visiting LA.,Mike_W_0771
20,Meh,All the big designer brands within a couple of miles of each other but really nothing here you don't find in other major cities.,spikethecat68

40,Every shop known to man,"The playground of the rich and famous. If you can afford it, this IS where to go shopping, but beware, do not try to be keeping up with the Jones'. You will go broke here!",GaDawg44
20,Not a big deal site to see,"This street in Beverly Hills is lined with expensive brand apparel shops (a lot of which I didn't recognize) with lots of expensive cars zooming around. The sidewalks were loaded with tourists snapping pictures and window shopping. After a few minutes, there wasn't much more to see. Note, that street meter parking seemed to be limited to 1 hour only, and the only other option was expensive public parking or find an empty spot in a nearby residential street.",cohoman
50,Parking Tip,If you are visiting you can use valet parking on Dayton Way next to Versace absolutely FREE for 2 hours. You can find more of these. I found another one on Beverly Dr.,yagoubs

50,I shopped Rodeo Drive!,"I felt like a million bucks shopping on Rodeo Drive!! Contrary to the movie Pretty woman, all the sales clerks were super nice to me. This is high class shopping! I thought Prada in Italy was the best, but by far, Prada Rodeo Drive is the most stunning. Most big designers are there. Rolls Royces and Maseratis everywhere. People shop around in their flip-flops. The beautiful sun was part of my amazing day. Luncheon was excellent as well. Bring the big bucks !!!",Sylvie S

40,Great for window shopping!,"Beautiful street. Ridiculously expensive shops, but it's what you expect in Beverly Hills, home of the rich and famous. A must, just to say you have walked down there when you see it in the movies. We were given a free sample of eye cream, which was supposed to get rid of wrinkles - collagen in a bottle - a $500 dollar bottle!!! And it was a small bottle too. That's how they roll on Rodeo Drive. I wish I was stinking rich so I could spend more time here and actually buy something, haha.",NatSteveC

Even if you aren't into the shopping, this is a great street to take a stroll down and people watch - an absolute staple for tourists in LA.",Foodie788
50,Star gazing,"If you come to California you have to visit Rodeo Drive once. Believe it or not, there are stores such as guess and coach that us normal people can shop at. The high end stores such as Louis Vuitton, have items that I don't remember seeing at other locations I've been too including Fifth Av. Parking is expensive, but do you expect otherwise? However the stargazing was what my niece loved. She didn't expect to just see celebrities walking down the street.",Maureen K
40,USA Tour,A good stroll & amazing display of high-end products. Worth the ride down the street which share memories of stars being filmed at some of the outlets. Shoppers paradise for the rich.,Sneha J
40,walk in the street,"Went there with my friends to check it out. Almost all of the shops are high-end ones and are very costly.

40,Window shopping for the girls and car watching for the guys!,Its a posh street with expensive shops on.

The window displays are amazing and the cars can keep your husband more than happy whilst you window browse or if you have the cash spend up big time!,D P
30,Quick stop,The shops here are amazing and show you how the rich and famous live. It is worth a walk down just to look at all the fashion and see designers that you do not get on the high street.,Rachel T
50,A people watching experience,"A must do if you like people watching. Very amusing watching people driving in circles in rolls Royce, Ferraris and other expensive rides. We got some funny looks when we went in some of the shops in our tourist outfits, but that's part of the experience. Some of the shoppers outfits are very amusing. A very good and entertaining experience.",joep735
40,Pleasant,Nice stroll and plenty of nice shops. All major designer brands and plenty of parking. Worth a visit if in LA,Jack W
10,No regulars needed,"well, Im not one for overpaying, even though I have the money and don't judge anybody. they are stuck up if you walk in wearing just a sundress, but, they didn't know I had money to spend. I hate the movie ""Pretty Woman"" but, it was like that.. these, maybe, minimal wage/ 10% commission , salespeople judge too much. better to just stay on the tour bus and chat with the driver, you will have more fun",hyppbytc69
40,Drive By,Drove through on our own but also as part of a Beverly Hills tour. Everything you would expect with all the high end shopping and exotic cars. No celebrity sightings but I'm sure there are typically given the status of the stores. We didn't have time to walk around but I'm sure any time spent walking around the Golden Triangle would be enjoyable,HankW80

30,Beautiful stores and nice walk,Interesting to walk down the famous Rodeo Drive. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was very quiet - just a few tourists around. Lots of window shopping as we could not afford anything inside. We did not find much else in the area - perhaps we missed it but we did not find anywhere to eat or have a drink which was disappointing. I thought the area may be a little more lively.,Melaniemayb
50,The best luxury shopping,"It's luxury shopping the European way, strolling along a nice street, not in a closed up mall or a department store. All big luxury brands are concentrated and they have elaborate collections. Just a great experience for everyone: window shoppers, big rollers or fashionistas in search of a Chanel, Prada or Cavalli steal in the sales.We love coming back here on every visit to L.A. There are also great restaurants within walking distance in the neighbouring streets.",SydNY99

50,A Lovely stroll,"Rodeo Drive is a fabulous and beautiful street - however, if you are there to shop (like I am ) it's best to go directly to your shopping destination and do what you have to do! There just seems to be a lot of ""lookie loos"" (which is understandable as it is a tourist destination) but it can be annoying if you seriously want to shop!",sunni2014
50,A must see Tourist Attraction,"When you live in this area you tend not to notice all the interesting things to see around here. But when someone visiting comes in you start to see it through their eyes and then see why it's such a fun place to visit. First of all, it's Rodeo Drive!!! Glamour, Glitz, etc. Some of the most expensive shops in the world plant themselves here. Then there is the people watching that is always fun. Women who have been to the plastic surgeon a few too many times, some of the outrageously bright outfits that the wealthy bought for way too much but think it must look good because of how much it cost, awesome cars that you usual only see on TV, star sightings, food, etc. And last but not least, the tourist themselves. Trying to guess where they are from and seeing how they dress and what interest them. Make sure if your in the area you check it out.",Real-Vacationer

30,Luxury shopping,"As LA is so spread out, it's difficult to get here and there isn't much in the way of restaurants. Most stores are guarded and only accept appointments.

50,Cool to see!,"Of course, I don't think any tourist is coming here to do some serious shopping, but rather just see the expensive clothing and extremely luxurious shops. My mom and I had so much fun just walking down this road and seeing the shop that Julia Roberts actually went into in Pretty Woman, and just seeing all of the beautiful shops. One helpful tip our Rasta Bus driver gave us was if the shop's doors are open, you are more than likely welcome to come in, shop, or look around, but if they are closed, they are more serious about you coming in and buying something (or you just aren't welcome unless you look loaded ;) Many shops had security lined up at the doors too. Thankfully we never encountered any rude employees or shop owners and were able to just enjoy the walk down this famous street!",ashlenclaireee
40,Lived up to the hype,Loved just walking down rodeo drive- it was just like in the movies and there were shops that the average person can afford to buy from as well as some great restaurants to have lunch it.,loobiloo20
30,Not worth the effort,"Rodeo Drive is a famous shopping street in Beverly Hills that caters to the very rich and famous. You will find there the store of the famous Iranian designer ""Bijan"" and his trademark yellow car parked just outside the storefront, and other high end brands from Bulgari to Cartier.Other than that, Rodeo Drive is just another street, immortalized in Julia Roberts epic shopping spree in ""Pretty Woman"" (""Big mistake... Huge""). There isn't much to see if you don't carry a black visa card so only visit if you're nearby.Tip #1: Beverly Hills has several parking lots that offer free parking for 2 hours. Check online and navigate to a free parking lot instead of paying.Tip #2: While you are in the neighborhood make a quick stop in the beautiful Beverlly Hills Public Library and their quaint children's area.",GameServer

50,Wonder around without spending a dime,"Whenever I go to Beverl Hills (which is every couple of months) I have the best time walking in the whole area, not just Rodeo Dr. The boutique designer shops are everywhere and even if you don't have the money to shop in these store, you'll love just looking in the windows. It's even a good way to know what fashions are going to be in style the next season so you can already be thinking of what you will see the the department stores.

40,A must see!,"The place is a bit scary. I have seen Pretty Woman, and I have seen what those horrible sales girls did to Julia Roberts. So I didn't dare venture into any shops as I was wearing flip flops and looked very much like a tourist. I'm sure I wouldn't have made it past the security guards at the door! So yeah, the place is intimidating but a must see if you're in the area. So many fancy cars if you're into that. I'm not but I was still intrigued. Check it out!",owowow
50,great place to shop,"Shopping in Rodeo Drive is a very pleasant experience. Many of the best brands are there, and contrary to what is depicted in some movies, the sales staff of the different stores are very friendly and helpful. You also feel very safe walking around, and indeed the people there say there is practically no street crime in Rodeo Drive. Thumbs up!",jledesma
40,Surreal,Wowsers! What a spot! Its unreal how the other half live! Great for people watching and a nice walk around. I was afraid to go into any of the shops in case I broke something!,Rachchic
50,Fun & Fancy,"I live nearby so I drive and or walk by almost daily and visit often, the finest and best fashion this side of Paris and Milan; great place to visit for stylish shopping and inspiration, there are many restaurants around to eat or snack.",jbisbal
30,Money Money Money,"If you ever wanted to see a lot of money, just walk down Rodeo Drive. I've never seen so many ""apparently"" rich people in their fancy pants & way too much makeup. I can imagine when Julia Roberts character got turned away from the store in ""Pretty Woman"" how she may have felt. You really don't feel that they take you seriously when you walk in the door. Even if you just want to go into the stores to have a look with no intention of buying anything it's still would be nice to get a welcoming & genuinely friendly smile & ""Hello"" they just never know, the least rich looking persons may actually have an obscene amount of money to spend!!!!",Mell Sheppard
40,Cool vibes.,"I could state the obvious and say that this area is way expensive, but that is really not what Rodeo Drive is all about. It's a great place to be seen and to see interesting people. The area is so upscale that it gives off cool vibes. While my wife and granddaughter were shopping I spent the time sitting on one of the many benches enjoying a cigar and watching the people. I actually had 5 different people stop to take my picture. I am not sure if they thought I was a movie star or they just wanted to show someone an American smoking a cigar in public but it was a different experience.",Lane H
40,Bring your money with you!,"As a non shop-a-holic, this part of the tour was great for snaps to say you'd been, but other than that, too snooty and pricey for my liking. Felt a little like pretty woman!",Helen M
30,Open up for longer!,"The famous Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills is renowned the world over for its array of designer shops. It's bright and clean and full of bling, but these days this diet of area exists in many other places . It closes early and there are very few restaurants, cafes or bars on the Drive to make it a worthwhile visit in the evening - so only 3 stars from because of this shortcoming",Wildhj
40,Amazing!,Though we can't afford to buy anything here but the experience is amazing .... Just window shopping is great .... Nice walk !!!,Preetika G
40,Beautiful road to visit.,"THE spot to visit when you're in Beverly Hills. It all comes down to this road when you are looking for luxury. Browse through the most expensive brands, all on one little street. Don't forget to stop by Bijan's store and take pictures. His cars are still parked outside last time I saw.",RoyaAS

50,Worth a half hour walk to see elegant profligacy,"Rodeo Drive represents and promotes the height of profligacy and conspicuous consumption. It's worth the time to stroll the several blocks between Wilshire and Santa Monica Blvd in Beverly Hills to see well-dressed rich people looking elegant even if their chic jeans have carefully etched holes in them. Indeed, especially if their jeans have carefully placed holes in them. Rodeo Drive confirms the worst impressions that most of the rest of the world has about Los Angeles. Fortunately, it's not a true reflection of this part of the country. Think of it as going to an exhibition of cultural oddities.So, in perhaps an ironic way, I am giving this five stars.",DrJerryLosAngeles_CA
40,Just walk and look!,This is the area of Beverly Hills to visit and see where all the high end shops are. You will find countless shops that you can't afford but pretty common in Beverly Hills with all the high end people that live here. Stay for awhile and you might see a star shopping here. They were holding a car show here on the day that we went. I recommend stopping by for anyone in the area as a must visit attraction in Beverly Hills.,Kdawg282
50,JUST LOOK!!!!!,Great to see how the seriously rich shop. Ralph Lauren store absolutely amazing. Never seen anything like this before. Doesn't cost anything to see great cars and maybe even a celeb. We're sure one came out of the ladies at Ralph Laurens. Great!!!,alberta and har... z
40,Rodeo Drive,"Just had to see for myself and pretended that i was Pretty Woman walking along Rodeo Drive. had a great time, but be warned not to ask how much anything costs as they won't be interested in serving you.

40,"It's A One Off..Upmarket, Expensive but the Street is Clean..Fun to Walk!",This is a must place to visit. You can walk up and down on Rodeo Drive in less than an hour and find all the best designers from the world. It's a daytime thing as most of the stores close by 6pm. All in all a good place to visit. It was fun watching different people taking pictures outside the flash stores. We stopped to look at a car...a yellow Bugati sitting outside a small cafe. There was a guy sitting there in the cafe. Didn't pay much attention to him until he got up and got in the car! Kinda funny!Sometimes you will see paparazzi outside restaurants trying to catch a glimpse of some celebrity having dinner. Definitely worth a visit.,Mary H
40,Good fun shopping,"Nice shopping area ,took my Daughter there as she has not been before and she loved it especially as the sun was shining, brought some items then walked around the corner to Villa Blanca fir lunch so had a great time and you should do it as its good fun.",rangers502

40,Shoppers Paradise and temple to mammon,"Rodeo Drive is everything you expect it to be , expensive , classy yet vulgar, smart , high rolling , full of Ferraris and Porsches and handbags and jewels.

50,Beverly Hills 90210,"If you are in the neighborhood, this is a must place to visit. You can walk up and down on Rodeo Drive in less than an hour. Here you will find all the best designers from the world. The only thing I didn't like were the hours. Most of the stores close by 0600 PM. All in all a good place to visit. If time permits, go visit some of the restaurants. There are some good ones in the neighborhood but like the shops, they tend to get a little on the expensive side. At night time, you will see paparazzi outside these restaurants trying to catch a glimpse of some celebrity having dinner. Definitely worth a visit.",Shah K.
50,A place to be is Rodeo Drive,"Visted here a few times this week and loved every min of it, the shopping 👍gotta love the big brand names staff are pretty nice and cool pleasant tho walking down Rodeo drive is amazing taking the views of the palm trees and cars.

30,Great for people watching but not much else,"Its a great place to walk down the street and watch people shop! Be warned, you may feel strong emotions as you watch teens walk out of the designer shops loaded with bags! Unless you're one of the uber wealthy and can afford to drop $1000 on a handbag without batting an eyelid -there isn't much shopping to be done here.But walk down, check out the great window displays and people bedecked in designer wear and maybe grab a bite to eat in the numerous restaurants!",Meghaj17
40,Window shopping,Love the (window) shopping. Seeing top fashion at its best while imagining the look for less!! Entirely possible!,aanthony2013

40,Pretty Impressive!!!,"That is exactly what I expected it to be; A very nice clean road with crazy amounts of very expensive stores. A few of the stores would not even let us in as they had a ""cover charge"" of over $10,000!!! It was very cool though to be able to walk down that very famous street in Beverly Hills. It is definitely a must do while in the area.",The World is My Oyster
40,A stip of obscene luxury amongst so much poverty,"Rodeo drive is a luxury shopping where you will find all the world's luxury brands within a 15 minute walk. Personally I don't feel comfortable walking into those stores as there is no chance of me buying anything but window shopping can be quite pleasent. What strikes me the most is the juxtaposition between this extreme wealth and the number of beggars, desperate and homeless people you see everywhere (of course not in roseo drive where I'm sure they have been shewed away). It's so sad and surprising that in the land of abundance, oversized everything and waist, is a society unable to care for the most needy and beggars are left to live in stench and filth. Anyway back to rodeo drive - if you put your blinkers on like most people do you can for an hour feel like how the ultra wealthy feel and stroll along the shops where they stroll.",ClotildeBlanchet
40,Dr Tasso Pappas day on Rodeo Drive,"Gorgeous stores, and displays. Wow, beautiful clothing and on Wiltshire a,aging car dealerships. Did not buy a thing but the walk down Rodeo Drive is well worth it.",tasso p
30,Good for people-watching,I feel Rodeo Drive is a little over-rated. The only people we saw were tourists. I'm sure the celebrities have secret back entrances to the shops who close while they are in the store.,Jan R
40,Just drive it,A definite must check out. Drive it like it take pictures enjoy it its yet again another neat place to see because of all the hype from Hollywood films and TV shows,~Michelle My Belle~

30,Just another high end high street!,Very over rated. All of the designer shops are there but it is like walking down any high end street in any major city in the world. It is exactly as you see it on TV. Every now and then you may bump into a Hollywood star!,Paul B
40,A welcome change from Hollywood,"We were disappointed in Hollywood as it was pretty dowdy, but Rodeo Drive was quite different - here the buildings seemed to shine - everything was so clean. It is a beautiful palm tree lined 2 mile stretch of fabulous buildings, complementary landscaping, and very high-end shops. We were able to park the car on The Drive and walk from one end to the other, taking the time to soak it all in and admire the work that has gone into creating this haven.It is well worth a visit, particularly if you too were disappointed by Hollywood.",mzurisana
40,High Prices Fashion,Rodeo Drive has all the big designer stores. It can be intimidating to an average shopper. OK to walk around and window shop for 1/2 hour unless you have big $$ and want to spend it.,4StarDave

30,Famous tourist attraction but...,"Rodeo Drive is one of the world's top tourist attractions for shopping but it is more in the having been there than in the actual shopping on offer that you will remember it. You will be surprised at how short it actually is. Sure, there are famous designer shops but too few and too small for all the hype. Contrast it with Milan's famous designer district and you might be left blaming Julia Roberts and Pretty Woman for inordinately raised expectations. A good place to stay in the vicinity is the excellent Beverly Hills Hilton which is a 5-minute walk away",Peter N
50,Shop Till You Drop,"What can I say ... it's Rodeo Drive so bring your wallet, lol. No, you don't 'have' to shop. Even strolling along and window shopping or just having a bite to eat is a lot of fun. Or perhaps you'd prefer to go ""Star Spotting."" The point is, shopping isn't the only thing Rodeo Drive has to offer. It's a fun time!",Shelly B
40,Neighborhood Tourist,"I've lived about two miles from Beverly Hills for over 12 years. Driven by it many times on my way to other places and visited bits and pieces while attending various events, but never really explored what it was about.I made it out alive, happy and for $13.If you are rich and there to shop, this is certainly your dream spot. Every ""Who are you wearing?"" high end retailer has a shop in Beverly Hills (certainly you don't need me to tell you this).I however, was just there to explore what else the 90210 had to offer.There are many lots that offer 2 hour free parking. Since i wasn't sure how long i'd wander, i found some side streets a few blocks away that would last me all day. Sunday offers more options as many street restrictions exclude Sunday. So that's helpful.Stop by the Visitor's Center first. Pick up area maps and a coupon book. Some coupons range from BOGO to 10% off your $1000 piece of art purchase.... (Tip: there is a free, fancy public restroom in the Visitor's center!)Next, take the $5 trolley tour. Well worth the cash. Enjoy sitting for the 40 min ride around the city, highlighting everything from ""yes, i see that the Guess store is there on my left"" to the ""oh THAT's where that is!"" The tour takes you up Rodeo drive, into the surrounding neighborhood to see a few ""former star"" homes including the ""Witch's house."" They will also point out a few places where movies have been filmed and then take you back around to the Beverly Gardens Park, where i learned that the city was built around this one really old tree. huh. Be sure to visit this park on foot to check out all the art sculptures and enjoy the nice 2 mile scenic stroll along Santa Monica Blvd.I visited the Sprinkles ATM. Originally thinking it was for cash, silly me it dispenses CUPCAKES, and only accepts credit cards! Pretty neat little racket. I used the ATM for the ""experience"" (work quickly as you only have 30 seconds to swipe your card before your order is cleared!) and then went into the actual shop next door and redeemed my BOGO. Cupcake was like $4.95, and worth very penny!Traditional ""selfie"" spots are on the stairs at ""Two Rodeo"" as well as the opposite end of the plaza at the Rodeo Dr/via Rodeo street sign.If you are wearing decent shoes, take the walk back up to the Witch's house and get a closer view. It's really neat to see up close. The tour says a housekeeper lives there.Brighton Coffee Shop is the oldest coffee shop in BH. They were closed on Sunday, but i grabbed a selfie anyhow.I stopped in the Paley Center briefly. Not much of a Museum-y person, but it's ""free"" (they encourage donations). Their current exhibit was famously owned typewriters. They actually had some really fascinating finds! Had i had more time, i would have checked out their archive of movies and tv shows. They have an extremely large collection available for viewing.Beverly Canon Gardens is a lovely area. Less ""garden-y"" than you would imagine (i walked past it twice before reading the sign that it was the garden). It has outdoor patio seating and a couple fountains. Really just pretty to see and enjoy a beverage.One really nice surprise was the Greystone Mansion. You'll have to drive there as it's a couple miles North from Rodeo Dr. Free parking and a nice stroll around the grounds of the Mansion, complete with a koi pond and turtles! There was a wedding happening when i was there, so i didnt get to explore everything, but hey, nice views, free parking and nice bathrooms? Win all the way around.For a touristy day out that was close to home, this trip fit the bill perfectly. If i was more of a ""Fashionista"" i'm sure i would have wandered the shops, but i was perfectly content otherwise.At the end of the day I had walked about seven miles.",jenandallthethings

40,A Must!,You cannot visit Beverly Hills without spending some time strolling down Rodeo Drive. The shop fronts are just amazing and every must have label is here.

40,How the other 1% lives,"We had intended just to drive through, but once my son saw the storefronts, we HAD to find a parking place. Prada ... Cartier ... Dior ... Dolce & Gabbana ... TAG Heuer ... and on an on. Absolutely amazing! And the vehicles - seemed like every other one was a Mercedes. Then there were the really expensive cars - Rolls, Bentleys, Maseratis. Then there was the guy driving his McLaren 650S down the street ... tooling along in a $280,000 car - now that's conspicuous consumption.",dwg51357
50,Rodeo Drive and Wilshire,"Fantastic experience great restaurants and shopping. Attended Versace event, we met many celebrities .I'ts a must to visit his place .",JRCoach
40,"Lordy, what opulence.","This is a fabulous street to gawk. The cars that park outside the glamorous shops are often rolls royces painted colours like (garish) Canary yellow or with the latest Lamborghinis being sentriy. The women look far younger than I, but suspect they are not. High shoes, short skirts, glorious outfits. It is all rather fake but fun at the same time. It is so very much worth a visit. I actually loved seeing one of the most well known, high rent streets in the world. It isn't exactly understated.... But that's part of its charm. Not the cobbled streets of s tiny hamlet or village, but the contrast is worth seeing......",JenniferMay2015
50,No Street like it on Earth,If you are just window shopping or you want to experience the best shops on earth the reside on Rodeo drive. Every designer store that exists has a presence here and articles you will not find anywhere are present on this street. It should be on your bucket list just to see the cars and the SUVs that are parked or cruise up and down this street.,Jerry K

40,Walk to de-stress,"Every time I'm feeling the stress of business, I just take a walk on rodeo dr. Do lunch with friends along any of the numerous bistros dotting the street , and some retail therapy works wonders. Specially right after winter or summer , the marked down stuff at the back of shops are just too dang tempting! I came home with 6 pairs of sneakers and a wristwatch! And the weather is mostly pleasant. This activity is highly recommended.",terrenceG777
30,You don't have to be rich...,Definitely take the time to Stroll down Rodeo Drive. Don't the security at the door intimidate you! There is something for everyone. Be sure to go by Bijan to see the yellow Rolls Royce parked out front and take a picture. You can also blend in with all of the beautiful people.,trvl4theluvofit
40,The most expensive shopping street!,Saw this from my hop-on hop-off bus and the tour person pointed out this road as the most expensive shopping street in the world! And i tend to agree. The best brands in the world were all on this road. Saw more Ferraris on this road than I had seen in the whole of LA!,Rajesh K

30,A great place to visit and people watch,"No visit to Hollywood is complete without a stroll down the iconic Rodeo Drive.No need to save up your pennies, unless you are a local or incredibly wealthy visitor, this place is window shopping only. With all the big names like Versace, Chanel and Tiffany and Co, this really is the luxe shopping experience it's hyped up to be.The street itself is very well maintained, with whitewashed buildings, large glass window fronts with regally fitted entranceways. The shops themselves, with their door guards, seem almost too intimidating to enter and just scream 'money'.It doesn't take very long to walk along the main strip, however you must take your time to walk along the Parisian part of Rodeo Drive. It starts right at the intersection of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard and winds up around Tiffany and Co, coming out at Dayton Way. This tiny little strip is absolutely beautiful with it's grand stairway and fountain, cobblestone walkway and decorated street lamps. Nevermind the shops like Jimmy Choo, Two Rodeo or Versace, the street itself is enough to keep you entertained.We headed across to Beverly Drive where we had a drink in the Beverly Canon Gardens before heading back along Dayton Way. This little garden area is a beautiful spot to feel quite posh, and pampered while people watching before heading back along Rodeo Drive.It's great experience to see how the one percent spend their time and money, but I wouldn't want to spend a whole day there. It's very iconic and grand, but without the megabucks to throw away on some very scary looking handbags, it won't take you long to get the idea. A true classic.To give you an idea of the indulgence of the area, even the fire hydrants are coated in a gold coloured plating.",ChantalTee
50,Good for a walk,"This famous strip is a must walk along thing to do, the shops are amazing and you just might run into a famous star along the way.",Gaile1958
30,A local's perspective,"Rodeo Drive is an icon. It's classic luxury. Yes, yes, and yes. There are many high end, high fashion shops that are totally worth the visit. BUTIf you have these shops in your own home town, why visit this area? Or visit but you don't need to spend a lot of time here. There are some really great places to eat around this area. There are a ton of shops on Rodeo Dr. as well as side streets. If you want to come to say you've been it's totally worth it. When friends come to visit we drive around this place. But if you really want to see more of a local vibe, smaller shops...if you want to see where many people that live in LA shop around this high priced zip code head over to Robertson Blvd.I guess I'm saying go. But you don't need to spend a ton of time here especially if you live in a city that has these types of stores. If you don't have the time I'd say there's so many other places to check out.Plus side, parking isn't all that difficult.",JKLIVIN77

40,Do you really need to read a review of this?,"Okay - it's a shopping street - high end shops, interesting people watching, very expensive things to buy. And it has been mentioned and hyped so many times, I wonder if anyone is still curious about what goes on there. Women in fashion victim shoes trying to navigate the stuff that not many people can afford, and we wonder why those who can afford this stuff bother - but I guess it impresses others. It's fun to look around. The sales people and security guards are all well dressed and occasionally someone actually buys something.",wywyno
30,Nice to see,This is what it is - PRICEY but the stores are magnificent. Nice to see the stores but well out of my price range. Nice stores right around the corner that were more reasonable,Cliff B
50,stunning,"the place is unbelievable, very glamorous, if you go to LA its totally worth it going there. You also have some places to eat lunch or have a coffee which are not expensive",victoria c
30,Surprisingly disappointed,"So of course when in Beverly Hills this is a must ! But honestly what a disappointment.. I guess since I'm used to '5th. Ave in New York city, I expected the same or even more bùt it was disappointing. Rodeo Drive is very small . It was like a 10 'minute walk. The priced in most of those stores are ridiculous. I would recommend driving by it , it's not really worth the visit.",exquisite t
50,High end shops,Not a very large area and obviously full of high end designer shops. I was actually looking for expensive shoes and whilst i didn't get them here it was lovely being able to wander round these high end shops with a purpose and to try some lovely shoes on. Do not be intimated by the assistants and remember looking is free.,Ellebee
30,Drive through - no need to stop.,"This was part of the hop on hop off bus tour we were on. It was fun to drive down but there was no need to stop, so we were grateful that the bus didn't.The stores feel like they are painted gold and it makes you realise the people who actually buy stuff here are on a different planet to us mere mortals. I'm more than happy with my $7 t-shirts from Old Navy but it was fun to ride along Rodeo and say ""we did it"".",MikeStrachan
20,I don't get it....,"Rodeo Drive is not for normal Americans. Who in their right mind wants to pay the prices there? My enjoyment was somewhat ""clouded"" by the need to use the restroom...which are non-existent. Thank goodness for construction portapotty in the alley. I suppose if you are ""star-struck"" and want to experience where the stars shop, Rodeo Drive is for you. Otherwise, it's a snooty place that has few places to park and NO restrooms for the public!",oldtravelagent

40,Must see,"Rodeo Drive is a must see. Theres not much else to do but window shop but the streets are beautifully clean and have a really LA atmosphere. I didn't buy anything or eat anywhere, but found a free carpark and loved just having a stroll around. Two Rodeo is lovely, but really just a small street with a couple of luxury shops on it.

I see lots of people smoke while walking and some in front of the store !!! There are lots of ciggerate throwing on the road and walkway ........try should provide more cleaner along this rodeo drive ........",ardena2015
50,Always wanted to see Rodeo Drive,Beautiful area with many very exclusive shops. I think the area is a must see if you are close by even if you don't make a purchase. The people are also interesting to observe. Quite a bit different than east Texas folks and I must add they are not nearly as friendly.,jvillemom15
20,It did nothing for me,Rodeo Drive. Lots of expensive boutiques. Too many snooty women. Too many plastic surgeries (read: Botox and implants). Lots of expensive cars. Not enough parking. It's over-rated.,sox1fan

Just walk the street and take in the atmosphere.",monkey2009Cheshire
30,Intimidating but a Must See,"Although I'm a seasoned traveler, I was a bit too intimidated to go into several of the stores. I did purchase a watch and did some serious browsing.

40,Woah.,I didn't realize this street was going to be so expensive. It was fun to people watch but if you don't live the expensive life then you will definitely look out of place... I felt a couple store employees stare me down as I walked around in my non Christian Louboutin heels lol still pretty fun to experience,natzeli m
30,Our hotel had walking distance to Rodeo Drive,".....I rated it ""average"", because it is a bit intimidating....you almost feel like you're not ""allowed"" to go inside stores....now, that's not because that's what we were told....it's simply how we felt.",MichelleandBob2013

Chanel, Gucci, Fendi, Michael Kors, etc..Do not forget Neiman's or Saks ,there is plenty of shopping to do.

There are several great places to eat within the area.",Jason F

50,Fabulous Fun,"It's expensive, over the top, fantastic store fronts to look at. Great for people watching if you can recognise ""stars"" without their make-up. Well worth a walk up and down the street - it's not that long. Fantastic cars driven and parked (if you're a car fan!)",dinnersistas

50,Always fun,"Bottom line, it's always fun simply because Rodeo Drive is iconic. Don't forget to wander on Wilshire if you like to window shop. Take in the city hall, look at the palm trees, have lunch. I mean, really, how often do most of us get to Rodeo Drive? Indulge and enjoy - maybe you won't go home with a Prada outfit but bask in the glow of so much fabulous fashion in such a small area.",RebeccaForster
50,"Awesome Cars, Beautiful Posers, Avoided Shops Due to $","There is not much more that can be said. To feel as if you are actually amongst celebrities, this is a great street to walk up and down. It was cold so we drove up and down it a few times. We are not into shoppers and we are not in the target market for these high end stores. Fun watching all the women with their grotesque Botox lips, floppy brim hats, fancy shopping bags, guys in royal blue suit with red shoes, and all the high end cars you could hope to see, all clean and polished of course. If I was in LA again I would make this street a must, just so I can see who I might see.",TheLifeguard
40,A nice experience,"A must do in my opinion when visiting the city. Not as good as Bond Street or Fifth Avenue but still pretty good. Was pleasant to walk around and the cars parked along the street were pretty impressive and nice to look at too! Parking was cheap and by accident we found a car park that even offers free parking for the first hour. The road seemed fairly short, I had expected it to be longer..",Sashakins09

Pretending we were locals, i.e. not tourists, we went through the various clothing stores trying not to gasp out loud when we looked at the price tags. Our only purchase was a small crystal bunny (it was Easter time) that was around $20.00. The cashier made the comment, ""Now we can close for the day,"" as he rung me up. I took it as a well intended joke.",Mzznlink
40,No Pretty Woman Experience For Me,"This iconic strip is packed with every high store you could possibly want to visit. The problem is that it seemed everyone was there to just ""see"" it not to shop. As we window shopped and looked into the stores it seemed that the people there were just standing around waiting for someone to have the nerve or the black card to enter their sacred doors. I'm glad I saw it - just wish I had my own ""Richard Gere"" to take me shopping :)",camrachic
30,Don't see what all the fuss is about.,"This was a must see for the good wife. It is a nice looking strip with some beautiful shops, but the same stuff that most of us would have to mortgage our houses to make a purchase, I prefer the outlet store personally :-).I was pleased that it was so short and we could then move on to the Farmers Market which was much more fun.",ShaunW1968

40,Beautiful Palm Lined Street,"At first glance it appears to be a beautiful ""palmed lined street"" with bustling shoppers, but as we walked down this street of opulence we were approached over and over again by people who were homeless and hungry. I found it hard to think about walking into any of these shops which sell things at outrageous prices while people are right in front of those same stores starving. For us, we enjoyed the walk and helped a couple of the needy and never walked into a store. I think if you go see the street, don't focus on the stores, but see if you can help those who are in need with that extra money you might be carrying.",Pat P

20,"Very nice in itself, but adjacent areas are not","Rodeo Drive itself is very pleasant, but it is a very small oasis in a hugely depressing area. Destitute people are an almost ubiquitous part of the streetscape in LA (and in many other parts of the US), and Rodeo Drive is an obscene reflection of the huge difference between rich and poor in the country, and also that many of the nonpoor inhabitants of a very wealthy country are happy to tolerate this.",PaulK1960
50,Its' so beautiful,"I love the restaurants behind Rodeo and the shopping in stores like Versace, the cobblestone walks behind the main drag.

Shop, eat, relax and enjoy the beautiful day.",Island_Girl_Films

A very high end brands with extremely high prices!The shops are all very well maintained and looked after.This is a must see if you are in Hollywood. Street is beautifully decorated.It looks as if this area is exclusively for super rich and famous who have no account of their money.Most public parking is free 1-2 hr.

Occasionally you will send a ridiculously expensive car drive down the road, but you wonder if who ever is driving it, is doing it just for the attention of the tourist. Nothing feels real but still I think it is worth a visit! And if you are in the mood to spend some money pop in to any store but in particular Bijan and pick yourself (or your partner) a suit, they only start at $40,000.",KristyPan
50,It's fun to dream....best part is looking at the cars!,"Ok, for the most part, I can not afford most items sold on Rodeo Drive. I still enjoyed going. My teenage son even had a blast because of all the expensive sports cars driving past. Oh, and if one is parked, it's a hoot to watch people stand next to it and take a selfie. Parking you own car can be a challenge but it you drive around, you'll find a free spot. We have always had luck parking on Rodeo...past all the shops, up in the residential area. It's free...but you do have to walk a few blocks to get to the shops.",Annette G

Because of that we actually made some purchases of some nice quality clothes (but not the super expensive stuff). Nice to see the merchants treat everyone like a potential customer and not discriminate. Paid off for them. On the whole, it's worth the visit - if nothing else to see what money can buy as there are some pretty nice items for sale here - although they're not really on sale - if you get what I mean.

40,High End Shopping Extravaganza,"Rodeo Drive is a must see for any visitor in the area - its the best window shopping ever! You don't need to buy anything to have one strolling by all the stores and visiting the myriad of shops along the way. There are stores for any wallet, as Cartier to Louis Vuitton are nearby Gap and Starbucks. There are plenty of choices to eat in the neighborhood - also varying in price point. Its a nice way to spend a lazy afternoon and who knows you might want to splurge on something nice to remember your vacation! Besides, where else can you get valet parking in the public parking area?",Ruth S
50,"A very fun, expensive walk.","Wonderful way to spend an afternoon, even if you don't buy anything. But dress the dress -- the ""T-shirt and shorts-wearing"" tourist is not likely to get the friendliest welcome at many of the boutiques.",38Traveller00
50,ENJOY THE RIDE,"Liked the entertainment, easy to work out that if your a plastic or cosmetic surgeon, this is the place to open up shop.Besides that, don't expect any cheaper shopping, at least not for the average person but who cares it's about experiencing Rodeo Drive, being amongst the silicone city and the cute little maltese and poodles that eat Fillet Mignon grade one for lunch.It seems like you have the world and then Beverly Hills but God Love them, I wouldn't want them any other way.Would I visit again, 100% I would, just stand in one spot and suck it all in.It's an American institution, do Disney, Universal and Beverly Hills and then go to the nearest Travel Agent because you will need a holiday.",VEM59
50,A MUST in Beverly Hills,"All I knew of Rodeo Drive was 'that' Pretty Woman scene, so when we were in the area I had to check it out. It was exactly what I was expecting, full of high end store's and beautiful people.I had to visit the Chanel store and eyeball the 'dream handbag' that I will never own (the iconic quilted leather flapbag...you know the one). I walked in looking like a scruffy mess, wearing an oversized t-shirt and flip flops and half expecting them to tell us to leave, but the staff were SO lovely and friendly!Perusing the make-up I was approached by 'Eric' who chatted about the difference between certain ranges in the US and UK, he was so helpful and ended up re-doing my make up and spritzing me with my favourite Chanel perfume, we were also offered drinks whilst we looked round the store and nothing was too much trouble.Although I had no intention of my credit card seeing the light of day I did end up buying an obscene amount of make-up, with lots of free samples and specials (that I could only get in the US) thrown in. Although it was a lot of money for me to spend, it was nothing in comparison to the majority of items in the store, but I was made to feel like a super star, and for the Chanel fanatic that I am it is something that I will never forget.Eric...you were amazing! The security guard on the door also did a great job in talking to my boyfriend about Football and keeping him occupied whilst I was being looked after.There are also some lovely little restaurants and places to grab coffee just off Rodeo Drive (S Beverly Drive).For all those Pretty Woman fans...the Beverly Wiltshire is just at the end of Rodeo Drive (opposite Tiffany's) :)",Clare B
50,chandelier for street lights...seriously,"A friend did tell me about this place earlier and I was super excited to go here. I already knew my pocket/budget does not suit any showrooms/stores on this drive but a simple stroll here and you feel nice. I saw cars I have only seen on magazine covers, chandeliers for street lights and much more. Just make sure you park your car on the outskirts else will get stuck in traffic.",Abhishek A

30,Shops are okay,"I expected more from Rodeo Dr. The shops are okay. The sales attendants are acceptable. The customers are much friendlier than the attendants themselves. The women in the Chanel boutique are not very welcoming. Not a great way to present yourself to someone who is about to give you the commission of a $5,000 purse.

50,A Must-See!,"Rodeo Drive is a must-see location for any traveller. The shops were beautifully presented in Christmas spirit and the whole street was decorated beautifully as well. You really need to go for a visit- both Chanel and Louis Vuitton are renovating and expanding their stores, so it's going to be even more luxurious than ever before (which is saying something).I have to give a shout-out to Adam in the Chanel store- he helped me track down a pair of their espadrilles in my size (which are impossible to find)... so if you're looking to splurge, pay the Chanel store a visit and ask for him to help you!",JessaLynch
30,"Can ""normal"" people even go inside the stores?","We ended up on Rodeo Drive twice; during 2 different tours of L.A. We walked down the street during one tour and were able to see the stores up close. One thing I noticed was the security guards standing at the entrances to the stores. They were really staring people up and down. This led me to wonder....can ""normal"" people just walk into the stores? We never tried because we didn't really have enough time on the tour. But I can't even imagine walking up to one of those guys and saying I wanted to go inside to shop. I did have my camera and took pictures, which also led to some dirty looks. I just felt really out of place. It's cool that I can say I've been to Rodeo Drive, but I wouldn't go back. For me, the best part of the entire experience was getting to see a Bugatti (owner of one of the stores on Rodeo Drive who charges a cover charge just to walk inside his door to shop). He must leave it parked there a lot because it was there both times we went by and I've seen other people post pictures of it on here.",TNHarleyChick

And if you have interest in from where all the celebrities are shopping and what brands they are shopping then visit the place.

30,Has its pros & cons,"Writing this review for the ""average person"" and I say that because I consider myself the same. I live a simple life although I do enjoy the finer things as well. Before I went on vacation to LA my main goal was to ""buy something from Rodeo Drive"" but when it was all said and done, I left with nothing but a nice walk, views of some very expensive cars and the KNOW that I really don't belong on Rodeo Drive.After the first couple of stores, I started second guessing myself and asking if I should even enter into the next because of the stares the security guards and staff give you from the second you walk in and then follow you around the entire time.I also realized that just because it's on Rodeo Drive the prices are quadruple what it would be if you purchased the same product elsewhere and I didn't really feel like throwing away money just to say it came from Rodeo Drive.On the flip side, the high end stores go on forever! Shop after shop, designer after designer and it was pretty cool looking at a $40,000 purse and $2,400 pair of shoes and some of the worlds most beautiful diamonds at Harry Winston. - where I didn't even bother asking prices. The streets are immaculate and the scene, especially since it was decorated for the holidays made it even prettier.My rating of a 3 is because for shopping purposes, it's just not a value and everyone is so stuffy and uptight. For the experience however I recommend that everyone at least visit once in their lifetime.. I mean, it IS Rodeo Drive, Baby!",THE-TW0-BEES

50,Fashionistas bucket list!,"When I first saw this area on tv, i thought It's located on a wide and long strip but its actually smaller than I thought. There's no doubt this place is a plethora of high end boutiques just like Madison avenue, 5th avenue, and soho in new york city. Maybe there are some sale items (I only shopped in BCBG since there was a sale on selected items) but you really have to dig in since people who normally shops in this strip are rolling on dough and willing to pay a regular or much higher price. It's just nice to walk around, and to experience what the fuzz is all about but if you're smart with your money, you would want go somewhere else to shop. But if you're in for a peaceful, less crowd and various high end boutiques then this place is for you.",YOU_RICA
50,A shopper's dream,"It was amazing to see how much money that part of Los Angeles has. I was blown-away by how much money people are willing to pay there, when they probably could find the same items for way cheaper elsewhere. I really enjoyed looking and walking around Rodeo Drive. I knew about Rodeo Drive since I can remember, and it was pretty cool actually being there. I'd probably never be willing to shop there (although my father or myself had purchased wristband at the Nike store, for me, at a very reasonable price).Rodeo Drive is an experience. I recommend everyone to go there at least once.P.S.: It says that I've been on Rodeo Drive in December 2013, but I've actually been there in the summer of 2010.

30,You have to see it once....,"We flew into California for a long weekend (from the east coast). This was our first visit to the West coast, and it is def. beautiful. I have always wanted to visit Rodeo Drive, so we set out one afternoon to see what it was all about. We got there early (9am) and parking was super easy. Go early for easy parking. The shops are all high end, Fendi, Prada, Vera Wang, LV, Tory Burch, Harry Winston. Its incredible to see the prices of everything. Every store we went in, I felt like everyone was really snobby and not very helpful. And I get it, Im sure they get tourist ALL DAY, taking selfies and just looking around the stores. But a good attitude goes a long way. The only store I bought from was tory Burch, because they were the nicest most friendly people on the whole street. Very Helpful, Very laid back. So they in turn got my business. Rodeo Drive is one of those places you go just to say you have seen it and been there, I probably wont ever go back, but I am glad I saw it atleast once.",Sarah1517

I didn't come across a single snobby or uppity sales assistant like I did in one of the luxury stores in Vegas.Whilst shopping on Rodeo Drive you should expect to be greeted warmly and genuinely within seconds of entering a store. At many of the stores, you'll even be served complimentary drinks and snacks whilst your packages are wrapped up.I've heard people complain that the products sold on Rodeo Drive are all really expensive, however while many of the products found on Rodeo Drive retail over $1,000, there are also plenty of products priced from $200-$1,000 (jewelry, hand bags, scarves) too.While I didn't experience a ""pretty woman experience"", I did catch a glimpse of the hotel and fire escape which Richard Gere's character climbed at the end of the film.

Loads of great shops to shop in if you have the money. We ended up buying a cracking ring fromTiffanys which she truly loves. We even saw Frank Lampard walk by!,Fonseca-Denning

40,Great after 9PM,"We visited Rodeo Drive after 9PM so we were able to park easily and for free (we didn't have to feed the meter). Sure, nothing was open except for a restaurant that we would have loved to have eaten at had we not just had a great meal at Lawry's.We strolled the road looking at the store fronts. It's a lot like Park Avenue in NYC, except for the fact that the buildings were only a few stories high and they were all unique (tailored to the stores that inhabited them).I really enjoyed the trip because I got to see Rodeo Drive, it may have been neat to walk inside a store or two, but honestly, I'm not a shopper and I was happy just to see the attraction. If you're a shopper (and have money to spend) or you want to go rich/famous sighting then go before 9PM, but if you're not a shopper and just want to appreciate the sights, then save yourself the trouble of the crowds and go after dark!",Zach D
40,Fun to drive through...,"Rodeo Drive is worth driving through because it is famous all over the world. But they have the same luxury shops that you find all over the world too. So the shops are not that interesting in my opinion but the architecture, the streets, the palm trees and the houses, in Bevely Hills are worth seeing. By the way, there was a Bugatti parked in front of a store on Rodeo Drive and wow... Everybody was stopping to look at it! Really enjoyed seeing the car!",Pomerols
40,More for the experience,It was (unlike Hollywoods walk of fame) very clean and has a wife variety of designer clothes including a lot of vintage things. Be sure to dress nice and be aware that some stores let you in with reservation and deposit only alongside the worlds most expensive store (Bijan).That being said it is an iconic road in cinema history and you'd be pretty stupid to make the journey to LA and not visit the place. It has a wide range of celebrities you can see too. Many amazing cars (including those of the famous Bijan) but if you're from London and shop at Harrods you'll see them all the time their too. I thought the staff to be friendly and helpful too and yes it can be expensive but if were being realistic what did we expect?,PersianDanny
40,An icon to see,"Worth a visit to say you've been. The street is actually really short. Expensive shopping but fun to look around. When we visited the street was closed to cars, street performance by Chris Botti Jazz musician which was great as we could listen and enjoy.",PanoKnS

40,Commemorate your trip with an item purchased on Rodeo Drive,"My husband and I travel to Beverly Hills 4 or 5 times a year. We have a tradition where we pick an item to buy from the select few of our favorite boutiques. Prada, Chanel, Ferragamo, Dolce & Gabana to mention a few, and have a memory of the trip that lasts long after your trip is over. You also get to see salesmanship at it finest (next to NY 5th Ave). This street is fun to walk up and down and people watch as well. You don't have to be a celebrity to feel like one on Rodeo Drive. Suggestion: dress the part to enhance your shopping experience!",Laura T
50,Pretty Woman,"Great placed to people watch, if you liked the film then you will really enjoy the walk past the stores. Even the stores you would buy from at home are more expense here.It is really just a spot the Star area, they do tend to appear at all times of the day.",Tigbox C
50,2 hours in reality tv land,"It's a street.It has high end fashion stores.You cannot go into several stores... for some, you need a reservation with a 1500 $ deposit. Bugattis are parked in the street.But its fun, enjoyable, and you see the street that is on housewifes, movies and teen tv shows. It's good to see the row of palm trees and fancy places, but walking up one side of the street, down the other, and that's it. (but I am not a shopper at all!!!)",Isa b
40,Viewing luxury is an experience,"but I do not imagine you will come back over and over if you are not particularly into art and novelty behind it all. It is kind of cool to see once or twice though even if you're not. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I disagree that you can find this anywhere. Most of this is only available in a handful of places throughout the world.",Me W

30,Rodeo Drive.....Okay!,"My first experience on Rodeo Drive wasn't what I expected. Suffice to say it is way larger on television than in real life...lol! It reminded me of Park Avenue, New York City, only better weather. It is not as long of a strip as I imagined; however, it does not disappoint with the high end shopping.

40,A nice experience.,"It was nice window shopping, to see where the Very Rich & Famous people shop. Also to see the places one sees on movies. Since it was spring there were beautiful flowers all over, which made the place so beautiful.All in all it was a nice experience.",DilrukshiH
30,Nice to Window Shopping,Its a very classy place but with not much to do unless you can spare some thousands to shop on the AAA stores spread around Rodeo Dr. Didn't think eating there was expensive though.Make sure you make a pit stop at the Sprinkles Cupcake ATM. We tried it and it's delicious and the fact they come out of an ATM machine it's super fun! :),Carolina G
30,Good shops to look at,Loved window shopping but not worth going in to shop. Doesn't have the famous Rodeo Drive sign that we see in the movies. But the shops were amazing to look at. Snooty people though. Well what else would you expect its for the rich people.,Logan M

40,Interesting viewing all those items that only the affluent can afford.,"While doing a tour of Hollywood and Los Angeles, one of our stops was at Rodeo Drive shopping district which is a major tourist attraction. This 3km long street in Beverly Hills has the reputation as being a luxury shopping destination of the rich and famous and others that live an elite lifestyle. Most of the top designer brands are represented there and according to our tourist guide, one even has to pay a few thousand dollars deposit when making an appointment to visit certain dealers. While my wife and daughter enjoyed strolling down those cobble stone roads viewing all those items that one can't afford, my son-in-law and I enjoyed viewing many great cars that we can’t afford. The tour operator informed us not to make a big effort to spot a celebrity, as you only need to look out for a lot of photographers congregating together to locate one!",LeonKay
10,We've been there,"Dec. 23 might not have been the best time to visit, but that was the only day that fit into our travel plans. We were surprised how small the shops are till we realized that stars really don't shop there; they send their ""people."" The streets were crowded with tourists searching for famous people. Sorry, guys, they don't show up in public like that!!",JANETM45
50,Perfect location,We stayed at the only hotel on Rodeo Drive Which was perfectly positioned. The shopping is fantastic with all top designer brands along with excellent restaurants & coffee shops . Take theTrolley Tam tour that runs from 11am till 4pm around the hotspots of Beverley hills.,karenbrooks370
50,"One of those ""Must-See"" places in life","Rodeo Drive is everything you'd expect and still holds a few surprises for those of us ""tourists."" I'd been before but it's still fun to revisit this iconic landmark to upscale shopping. Be sure to bring a camera/cell phone to take pics. Its fun to window shop even if you have no plans to shop. The streets are very clean and you'll see pretty much every make of high end luxury car that exists. As we were searching the side streets for a parking spot I thought I heard the throaty rev of a motorcycle behind me. When I looked in the rear view mirror I realized that it was actually the roar of a high revving Lamborghini sports car. When I finally did find a metered parking space it ended up being behind an enormous Bentley coupe with a W-12 (not V-12, but W-12) 600hp engine. Rodeo Dr is still fun for the average Joe too. There's several outdoor seating restaurants, cafes and yogurt shops where it's fun to dine and people watch.",0221Serendipity

30,Worth a quick visit,"Unless your truly in the highest of net worth population, this is an interesting place to drive to and window shop while you stroll down the street.

Every big name is there and window shopping might be the best way to do it...I, for one was not about to spend untold dollars for clothing or shoes on my budget. Oddly, there weren't all that many window displays, but the ""goods"" can be easily seen from a distance...smile...",MonikaDery
50,A must do,We had to see the famous Rodeo Drive. Glad we did. Probably the best shopping experience we have ever had. You would think with all the tourist and window shoppers that they would be rude but it was the exact opposite. They treated us like we were movie stars. Every store we visited was the same. I bought cologne and a week later I received a hand written thank you letter from the sales man. Crazy I only spent 50.00 dollars there.,Joe C
40,Just Gotta Do It,"As an East Coast person, I just had to see Rodeo Drive. You feel your tourism-ish-ness as you walk along. Saw no stars but only other tourismy people. (I made that word up. Can you tell?)I could not stop taking photos of the window displays. Shops and shops of exquisite clothes, shoes and jewelry! There was a gold and black Bugatti parked in front of a store that my son went nuts over. We just said the heck with it and took a million photos of it. I mean, when in Rome, right? (Except the locals would probably not take photos of their own cars, but you get the idea.)Obnoxious bottled water vendors chase you around which is a pain and parking is outrageously expensive. Per our local friend's advise, we parked at Saks Fifth Ave, went through the store, pretended to peruse beautiful, unattainable items and then headed out to sightsee.Enjoy Rodeo Drive but eat lunch first elsewhere and remember if you do the Saks Fifth Avenue parking stint, you have to be back by a certain time or your Bugatti will turn into a pumpkin.",happynowyoga

50,A completely different lifestyle,"Ironically, parking is free for the first 2 hrs in the city lots, which happened to be perfect for sightseeing the small but beautiful street. So much to see in such a small street, and the wealth was obvious everywhere. Great window shopping at the flagship boutiques and designer shops lining the strip, watching Bugattis Rolls Royces and Lamborghinis roar by proudly, and people watching those who actually made purchases in certain of the most highend stores. Everywhere was so clean and neat, richness at every detail. If you come early enough, the $5 city run trolley tours looked interesting",R_26C
50,Rodeo Drive,I loved strolling down Rodeo Drive when we visited LA in December. It was beautiful was just to window shop even if we weren't buying anything :) We splurged and had a great dinner there which was super fun. Living the life even if only for one meal haha.,ashwoo88

Many branded boutiques on both sides of the road, with expensive cars, driving pass or parked along the road. My wife bought a couple of items in one of the shops there. That was about it, on experiencing the lifestyle of the rich and famous for a day.",EF71R

40,How the other half live,"Not sure I'd be able to afford a bottle of water on Rodeo Drive. It has to be seen though, treading in the footsteps of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. You won't find any charity shops or Poundlands on here, all shops are high class and oozing expensiveness.Car watching is an easy pastime on Rodeo Drive. We saw plenty of flash cars including McLarens and a Bugatti Veron in the 45 minutes we were there. Seems like people just cruise to show off. Fair play to them.We parked up in a valet parking area inside a shopping centre on S. Rodeo Drive much to the wife's horror. Fears of huge cost were not realised. It worked out to be $2.75 for each 15 minutes, so just over $8 for our 45 minutes. Glad we didn't stay any longer though!",Mark B
40,Shopping awesome,"Great stores, mostly higher end but they did have a Nike store that my kids liked. Fun to do once in your lifetime though! Check that off my bucket list!",frazgoirish
40,Worth a look!,Drove down here on a tour bus. Nice to see but unless you have lots of money to spend you might as well drive down it! Cheapest shop is probably Guess! You see lots of fancy cars as well. At one end is the hotel that was used in Pretty Woman and you can see the balcony that Richard Gere stands on.,debs21
40,WORTH HALF AN HOUR,"This is where the rich and famous drop their millions.I didn't go in. My wife went into the ladies' clothing shops to see what sizes they had in stock. There is a Bugati parked in front of one stores which is the object of permanent adulation.If you're not buying, just pick a tour which includes Rodeo Drive. Rodeo Drive is quite short, and can be done in half an hour.",constanttraveler71

40,Rude employees,"We went there to just take pictures and primarily window shopped.The retail employees were kinda rude & snobby. I went into the Gucci store, we made eye contact, and no one smiled or greeted me. I was in the store for 10 minutes and left b/c no one helped me.",cattttttttttt

30,Rodeo Drive,"High end shopping franchises like Van Cleef & Arpels, Bulgari, Bijan, Ferragamo, Dolce & Gabbana, Miu Miu - but nothing you couldn't find in any other similar strip. If you're looking to spend a bundle - go for it! But no movie stars walking around. Lots of very well-to-do tourists with bulging shopping bags and lots of very down-at-the-heel tourist groups and buses with loud microphones. BTW - an acquaintance of mine who looks like and is a very middle-aged hippie said she went into several of the shops just to gawk and was treated VERY politely.",Justbetweenyouandme
40,High end shopping,"For those of us that do live here & go to Rodeo drive for the 1 st time it's exciting. But, it is just a high end shopping experience. We can get that in NY.

40,Worth a look around,Took in rodeo drive during a bus tour and also. I walked the area on foot. It is nice to walk up and down the area and see the sights on the rodeo drive. One shop on the drive was called bi jan. One of the nice things to see is the Bugatti parked outside and a memory to the owner. Great for shopping if you have those extra bucks.,lowieEngland
40,"Worth seeing, but there's not much to it","You might think that Rodeo Drive goes on for miles, but it's really only about 4 blocks. However, if you have an eye for expensive things, you might find it fun. I really enjoyed seeing a $2 million car parked on the street! If you're in LA or Hollywood, take the time to do the short walk and browse the items for sale. It's a must for LA tourists.",Freed0mt0travel
50,Getting to Rodeo Drive,"I had guests from out of town and they wanted to go from San Diego to Rodeo Dr. I did not want to drive to or in LA and had taken the train to LA before so figured we could probably have a fun day if we took the train for our adventure to Rodeo Drive. But, the train stops at Union Station, how to get to Rodeo Drive from Union Station? It turned out to be very easy. We left San Diego on the 7:11 AM Pacific Surfliner. At Union Station we bought a Tap card for $1.00 and loaded it with $5.00 for the day pass. Then we turned around and headed into the Metro. I had found the Metro Map online and knew we needed to get on the Purple line riding it to the end at Wilshire and Western. Then we caught the 720 Bus going westbound. We got off at Beverly Drive (about a 15 minute ride) walked one block and headed up Rodeo Drive. A lovely street with nice shops and nice people. In fact, everyone in LA was so nice and so helpful to us. The agents at Union Station, the people on the Metro and the people on the bus were all helpful. I was very impressed with the public transportation system in Los Angeles. In fact, after our visit to Rodeo Drive, we looked at our Metro Map and realized it would be easy to take the 720 Bus back to Wilshire and Western, hop on the Metro and, with one transfer go to Hollywood and Highland to see the sites there before heading down into the Metro again, then back to Union Station to catch the 5:10 PM train to San Diego. It was a wonderful day.",Mary W
30,Rodeo Drive is nice stop over,"If one has the time, it is always interesting to either drive down or walk down Rodeo Drive, particularly at the end of the year when Xmas decorations are up and music can be heard from the speakers that the city puts up. People watching and checking out some of the local nearby restaurants like Nate N Al Deli two streets over on Beverly Drive make it a popular tourist destination. Shopping is a little out of my price range but it's worth a stop over if you have some extra time.",travelfourless

50,"Beautiful shops, frequented by beautiful people paying hefty prices","Rodeo Drive and its well known shops is all that it is cracked up to be, The decor is magnificent. The stocks are expansive and expensive. The service is excellent. If one is a window shopper, a great time is assured. If one is a serious shopper, the same holds true if you can pay the price.",Charles M
40,Big names and had to be seen,We walked down this road in the evening so most of the shops were shut but just wanted to have seen it. Every big name shop is there and it's well worth a visit.,Redhackers2
40,Walk the LA dream,You got to visit the Rodeo Drive when visiting Los Angeles area or you are going to go home empty handed.I strongly recommend that you don't waste your time trying to look for street parking. There are few parkings around and the prices are fairly reasonable. Rodeo Drive is surprisingly not that large of an area so you should be able to walk around in less than hour. You will find the stretch of designer stores. Bijan is the most iconic one with yellow Bugatti parked right at the front. You would need to arrange for appointment to enter the store but free to watch from the outside.,dralexmoto
50,Touristy and glamorous...a bit of both!,"It's fun, it's touristy and you know you want to go! Whether you are windowshopping or shopping shopping, this is a fun place to go if you are in the area. Besides all of the upscale shops, there are plenty of tourists to look at and people watch. Also very fancy cars lined up and down the street parked usually. Don't miss the Bugatti in front of the house of Bijan!Also, remember that almost any parking lot will have to hours free parking, which is more than likely more than you need anyway. There are really great places nearby to eat and of course you want to look at the Beverly Wilshire, the Pretty Woman hotel.Have fun!",traveler4k

30,One of those checklist items,"For a family with young kids that would never dream of shopping at one of these stores, this was a checklist item that we felt we had to see, since we where in Los Angeles. I really didn't have high expectations, but since I was driving Santa Monica Blvd, we had to take 5 minutes to go down this street. It was interesting to see all the nice cars.I actually preferred driving Rodeo Drive just north of Santa Monica to see all the nice houses. To me, they were much more interesting to look at than store fronts.",z28colt

50,Wow factor!,"To be actually on Rodeo Drive was enough for me. So many name brand high end companies on this street. You are in the heart of Beverly Hills! Stars homes and the infamous Beverly Hills hotel. We stopped in Prada, Gucci, Louis V and some other stores that I can't remember. Lots of Range Rovers. And not many celebrities but I suppose they wouldn't do their own shopping anyway..",EvangHouston
50,Beverly Hills dream street delivers the fantasy!,"Rodeo Drive is a must visit for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the world of high end boutique shopping in an exceptional environment. A few tips for enjoying the experience with minimum hassle:Go early on Sunday if you want to avoid crowds -- stores on the Drive usually open at noon but the surrounding streets (Beverly Drive, Canon, etc) have shops that probably open earlier. Park for free for two hours in a city lot -- SECRET AWESOME PARKING LOT is located on Dayton Way, just off Rodeo, underneath the Two Rodeo complex. They have free valet parking, clean restrooms and an elevator that will take you up to Two Rodeo, which is at the foot of the main shopping street and the epicenter of the experience.Be nice to the store employees and they will be nice to you (I know -- I used to be one of them). Most of the folks who peruse the stores are not there to buy so courtesy goes a long way and you'll often get some great stories out of the shop keepers. Do not bring food or drink into the stores!Bring your camera as Rodeo Drive is a favorite place for people to show off their awesome cars, rented or not. The little dogs are amazing. The outfits are amazing. The flowers on the street are amazing. The city of Beverly Hills and the Rodeo Drive Committee pour their hearts and coffers out to make this street special. You will not be disappointed. Holiday time in December is extraordinary. Two hours is enough time to browse unless you are dining or doing some serious shopping. Dress up for the visit, don a pair of dark sunglasses and you might be taken for a celebrity! Be sure to check out the Beverly Wilshire hotel while you are there as well.",Ohiofamily
30,This is what everyone has been talking about?,"Rodeo Drive...don't blink or you will miss it. That's right, the movies have created a legend that is overwrought and overrated. It's Ok. It's pretty. But, really, it's no better than any other small high-end shopping district anywhere in the USA. Glad I could cross it off the bucket list, but makes me think the A-listers are really even more full of it if they think Rodeo Drive is all that.",Terre B

40,Shopping Shopping Shopping,Rodeo drive is on anyone's list of things to do in LA. Everyone can people watch on their streets. (almost always a celebrity or two) While many of the upscale shops are located there they have several you can find that are reasonable in their offerings.

40,Touristic Must,"It was under the mandatory things to do in LA in my wife's itinerary. I accepted under the only premise she would not buy anything. But still was a nice plan. The shops are nice, there is pretty people and cars around, and usually you would see someone famous around a boutique.The only hassle of the place (besides the price of things in the shops) is to park the car. The best place to park it for free is around Charleville blvd between Bedford and El Camino st. You would find pleanty of free spaces there up to 2 hours of free parking. Its pleanty of time for you to go to Rodeo Drive (2 blocks away) and walk up to the Beverly Hills sign in Beverly Gardens.Have fun...!",RMartinSDXB

50,"Didn't buy anything, but still fun!","There's 2 hour free valet parking at Via Rodeo so that was a bonus! We just walked around and window shopped (I didn't feel comfy even stepping into the stores). All the stores were huge! You can smell the perfume and the leather from the street without having to go into the stores. I'm sure everything costs an arm and a leg, but everything looked so beautiful and glamorous. I didn't really see any famous people, but I'm sure they were all there with all the fancy cars parked in the area. I really enjoyed it.On the next street are more reasonably priced shops and restaurants so once you are done, just head down one block where you don't have to spend your life savings on a snack.",buttercup1211

We did not see any stars, though a friend of mine went just a week after we did and saw Angelina! (or so he says). It's basically just a street lined with (mainly) upscale stores, but it still feels special to tell friends and family you were ""on Rodeo Drive"" and to take some pictures of the Beverly Wilshire and the street signs and the stores and all that fancy stuff. We parked in one of the lots on Beverly Drive, but just a note, it was a really busy drive to get there. It doesn't take much time at all to walk up one side of the street and down the other - especially if you aren't there to do actual shopping. It is fun to PRETEND you are there to do actual shopping, though. It's a check-the-box type of ""attraction"", but it's almost a must-do.",clamc40

Aaahh ... stuff that I hope to splurge on some day!Rodeo Drive is only two or three blocks long. Short drive, and parking is a hassle.

50,"A ""must visit"" if you like to shop for high end fashion.","Is this the absolute best shopping experience in the world? No, but it certainly is one of the prime destinations in North America (all of the Americas, in fact). If you don't like to shop, or have an aversion to designer luxury brands, then this is perhaps not the place for you. There is an incredible diversity of architectural styles, a wide assortment of brands and all the history associated with what once, a hundred years ago, was a mere cow path (hence the name Rodeo Drive). Parking can be a challenge if you don't know the area well, so you might want to plan ahead before actually arriving, there are various parking garages in the immediate area, but they are generally hard to spot before you are right on top of them. While there is street parking available, it is very limited. What separates this street out from many other high street shopping experiences is the fact that the weather is almost always great, regardless of the time of year. Be prepared to interact with a lot of tourists, they can be more heavily represented than local residents. Many visitors come to Los Angeles to visit Beverly Hills.....well, this is about as central to the current mindset of Beverly Hills as you can get, so if you have the time in your schedule and enjoy walking, this is a good opportunity. It is not an experience for everyone, however.",og84

30,It was a pretty average place to go shopping for designer goods.,"Honestly I would rather shop Regent St, New Bond St or Bond St in London than Rodeo Drive, but it did look clean and pretty.

This is what Beverly Hills is all about - must be seen.",paula12321
30,Try it at night,"We found that a walk along Rodeo Drive by night was a fun alternative to gawking during the day. It had rained when we visited, so the streetlamps cast a warm glow against the cobblestones and made the buildings appear even more like a stage set than they normally do. Since most visitors want to just have a look and don't intend to drop thousands on a shopping spree, being there in the evening is a good way to get the experience without the sticker shock and the crowds that tend to fill it up during the day.",LoladeTiburon

30,Upscale shopping area that offers little advantage to similiar shopping elsewhere.,"While seeing Rodeo drive in the day provides a bit of entertainment, I find a stroll at night to be a bit more telling. All major cities have upscale shopping districts, but most don't take all their merchandise & lock it up. Rodeo drive at 2200? Not even the cheapest Rolex model on display. I do also wonder who would seriously shop there. For the exaxt same thing as the $2'000 Canali suit in my closet, the Rodeo drive location wants $3'000. What makes it worse is that I only paid $1'000 for mine. $2'000 for the honor of buying a suit on Rodeo Drive? I admit to being generous but the difference is a little too rich for me to be able to justify doing so.",theswissmister
30,Overrated attraction,"Undoubtedly one of the most famous streets for shoppers and tourists, Rodeo Drive has some of the most exquisite stores on the Planet. That said, it is a bit much to be scrutinized by guards when entering stores and having to deal with snobby (not all) clerks with an attitude. I was looking for a watchmaker who could tell me where I could find an authorized dealer for my particular watch (there is one in the area) so that I could have the battery replaced without having to send it to Switzerland. I got nowhere. ""WE do not carry that watch, only @#$&."" It was an experiment that showed me that the perceived class is only superficial and self-serving. I got more help at Macy's down the street than at Van Cleef and Arpels, Cartier or Rolex. This was not a good experience.

30,Very much 'Pretty Woman',"Yep, snobby store assistants really are here. Couldn't believe it. Went into shops with money in our pockets but the staff in some stores were just not interested. Not everywhere but it existed.",BagmanNZ
40,Lots of fancy stores,"My wife and I actually drove and walked down rodeo drive at about 7am on a weekday before any of the stores open. We were the only ones on the entire street, and it was perfect and just the way I liked it. Didn't need to go shopping in any of the stores, just wanted to check out the street and we did. It was really nice and peaceful without all the hectic shoppers lol. check it out.",cksteeve
30,Upscale Disney,"I'm not a shopper, so take this with a grain of salt. Rodeo Drive is an upscale shopping strip with the feel of Disney crowds. Tourists move like cattle up and down the sidewalks, snapping photos and hoping to see stars. It was nothing much. Most of the stores are also in other major cities. Plus there are only one or two restaurants or bars to rest after your day of shopping.",TVDad
50,Strolling Rodeo Drive,"We spent an afternoon strolling down Rodeo Drive and the side streets. We parked on the street near the police department. I thought that the store employees would not be welcomimg since we were just browsing, but they could not have been nicer. Can't wait to go back!",ahawes6
50,By car or by foot,"Driving up in your rental car in slow pace, spotting for nice cars and celebrities. Or seeing the Rodeo Drive by foot, you will have a nice time. It´s something forfilling about seeing the streets you have watched on hollywood movies since your childhood. Worth a drive, or walk!",Aleksander J
50,Great People Watching,The people watching is as interesting as the window shopping. A mix of tourists and locals make this a great place to visit.,Camilla_S

50,The Best Gets Better,"We live only blocks away, and we have seen the rise and fall of businesses even on Rodeo Drive.Beverly Hills has been upgrading, They are discussing the rechanging the name of one of it's casual streets (Santa Monica Blvd. South) to it's historical name of Burton Way. The City is in massive growth with top Name Stores, not only on Rodeo Drive, but on Beverly Drive, Camden, Cannon and Santa Monica Blvd. South. The street decorations for Christmas were spectacular. The sidewalks were packed and the streets slowed down by tour buses. Everyone was smiling. The restaurants were packed,All was added to by a remarkable heat wave, contrasting with the extremes elsewhere.My overall impression of Rodeo Drive and Beverly Hills generally, is positive for fun and shopping. If the overall economy is even close, we are headed to a few years of spectacular health.Never saw so many smiling faces in all of my travel.I am prejudiced, but honest, this is a great destination, and worth returning.",PaullMD
40,Just cool to see,"Fancy window shopping, but fun to stay a bit and walk around. We are from the auto industry, so cool to see how many fancy/expensive cars are in the area. You can walk to Urth cafe which is popular as well-long line.",dolittledigger

40,Rodeo Drive at Christmas.,This is one of the most outrageous streets in all of Los Angeles. You can spend an entire paycheck in the blink of an eye. Well worth the stop to visit and just get the idea of what money can do. The shops are immaculate and have only the best of the best. Unless you have money don't even think of the price tags and if you have to ask the price then you cannot afford it.,Tonia Louis H

50,Fun to shop with your hands in your pocket,"Fun to shop with tour hands in your pocket. The prices are outlandish and the shoppers are often an eyeful.

40,A nice place for a walk.,"Rodeo Drive for me is mostly a very nice place for a walk, especially from late October to the end of the year, when gorgeous Christmas decorations are on display.The street is, of course, immaculately clean, has beautiful designer shops and restaurants of the highest class on both sides, nice flower arrangements, very well dressed people, luxury cars, just don’t count on seeing celebrities as it very seldom happens… Of course, if luxury shopping is your coup of tea you’re in the right (if not the best)place – otherwise, just grab a coffee or a light lunch at one of the restaurants with outside tables and just let it all soak in …",worldnomad_01
40,Worth a look,"It wasn't what I had expected. It is worth going down there for a look see. It was cool to see the stuff that you see on TV. The stores were way out of my price range, but I was just down there to look around anyway.",sigs99
50,Leave your money at home.. Unless you have a black Amex!!!,"A must.

50,A must-do while here!,"This review of course is a no-brainer. Rodeo Drive is a must see even if you aren't going to purchase anything. It costs nothing to walk around and see the very best retail stores in the world.if you are a movie fan, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel was featured in many movies including Pretty Woman.",traveler4k
50,Definitely worth the trip,Since I live in Beverly Hills I have seen this street change over the years and it is getting more beautiful every time. RODEO drive is THE street to see with gorgeous shops and gorgeous people but for shopping with less money you will have to go to the neighboring streets like Beverly Drive and Brighton Way.Lots of fabulous restaurants in the neighborhood as well.,MakeMyBed
40,I came to relate it to movies,"It might be very cliched if I say I just remembered the set of Pretty Woman. I even went to the water and took some pics of the washroom...wow. Its a place where you want to see awesome cars, awesome shops and occasionally famous men/women. I enjoyed watching Lamborghini's, Ferrari's, Bentley's, Rolls Royce and tons of Range Rovers, Jaguars, Porsche and BMW's",handofgod7
30,"Famous, but not fabulous","If you are going hoping to see stars shopping, forget it. Stars make appointments at their favorite establishments, so it is rare to see any of them. Rodeo Drive is very clean and very dated. From an architectural point of view, there is nothing special to view. Rodeo is covered with all of the many designer shops one may want to see. There are no sales and no discounts. People-watching can be fun.",bbtapper

20,Left feeling underwelmed,"Visited Rodeo drive today and failed to see what all the fuss is about. There's not much to see really, a few shops on a small street corner and a fountain. Guide books seem to suggest that you can go 'window shopping', but this is pretty pointless as there are so few things in the windows to see! For a posh shopping experience I much prefer a visit to Knightbridge and Harrods!",Claire H
50,""" pretty woman"" set came to life",This is what I always think when visiting this place. We brought several families and friends visiting California all the time. It is a nice spot to reminisce the movie pretty woman. Not only that you step into the wold of ultra chic signature brands. Worth for picture taking ops and maybe occasional celeb sightings...and luxury cars rolling by. It is an iconic location and very short hop to the Beverly Hills park,marion93722
50,"3 words- beauty, luxury and fancy","summer 2013 i was on the west coast of USA.L.A is on the itinerary and Rodeo drive is def on the top 5 things to do while in L.Abeing like most average tourists visiting rodeo drive, most of the shops had things that were affordable. but that still shouldnt dampen anyone's intention of going to this area and just spending an afternoon walking around for merely admiring the beauty. be it the architecture, or the decor of the stores, or the lovely clothes/bags/shoes/jewelry on display, or the luxury cars.everything about this place is over the top and upscale.we were lucky to find free valet parking for upto 3 hours at a hotel right at Rodeo drive. so without any worry found parking easily (there r plenty of pay and park garages as well) and were on our way to check out all the different stores on each side of the road.i would suggest one should start at the beginning of the road, walk right till the end, cross n walk back on the other side. this way people can see all the stores and not worry about going from one side to another.burberry, chanel, cartier, dior, fendi, armani, lv, gucci, guess, jimmy choo, coach, prada, rolex, ralph lauren, ferragamo, tory burch, tiffany, vertu, valentino, etc etc etc one beautiful store after another.walk into any of the store n atleast try some of the stuff if not really buy it. one can buy a small little thing from any of the stores to make it a part of your memorabilia, but for most guys (like it was for me) the price range was crazy.there r plenty places to eat in the area. so just wear pretty clothes, walk around, take pictures, grab a bite at one of the lovely restaurants and im sure its gonna be one heck of a day. dont forget to keep an eye on the road for the luxury cars and maybe celebrity spotting.",darshita
40,Fun to shop,"When we stayed in Beverly Hills we decided to stop and shop on Rodeo Dr - sort of a ""to say we did"" scenario. We didn't see any celebrities sadly, however the stores were excellent. Prices are what you would expect from top tier luxury stores in Beverly Hills, so be sure to plan accordingly if you intend to do the same as we did. If you like the finer things in life you will definitely find them here.",bfarber

40,Worth the experience,"Something different as this is an exclusive area, nice to walk around and lucky me to met a celebrity.. Its quite a memorable day for me to experience, window shopping in all the brand names shops of the world. I went inside the Bulgari shop and saw something quite really different and was fascinated . If you have explored the area quite well, you can have a good shopping at the other side of the street, wherein there is some affordable and good shops and well known brand like the Guess and the famous Bebe brand. With all my worldwide travelling,I can say the best place to spend your dollars is in America, really good value and the best shopping you can ever had. My advice look online and write down what is it, and then go to that shop, and enjoy shopping.",maganda0411

30,Take plenty of cash,"If you like your designer shops, then head here. I'm not a design fan so it doesn't really do it for me.

It was a lot of fun and I was surprised that the people in the shops were extremely nice even though they probably knew I could not afford anything they had.

40,"Worth a visit, but don't expect to buy anything!","We enjoyed the 90 minutes or so that we spent walking around Beverly Hills, including Rodeo drive. We parked two blocks above Santa Monica on Rodeo Drive, in the residential area area on Saturday during holiday weekend. I would NOT pay to park to go there being from NYC where we have many of the very same ultra high end shops. Nonetheless it is a spectacle worth seeing regardless of where you are from. The shops are actually welcoming of the mainly tourist crowd on the street. Sprinkles cupcake and ice cream shop were so crowded we didn't feel like standing on such long lines. I think the lines were due these being affordable treats in an over priced area. We saw Ferraris, Bugattis, Bentley, Benzes, Maseratis lierally just parked on the street and parking areas. Some restaurants were full. Overall, it's worthy of a stop, but real everyday people will take their spending elsewhere in LA.",SBFINCT

How can you not whilst in LA!?!Unfortunately I had no Pretty Woman moments just for the thrill and I'm sorry to say that the shopping is just as you'd expect when visiting branded stores.Dior, Lanvin, Prada etc are no different from their sister stores world wide. There were non of the special LA lines or undiscovered collection moments that I was hoping for.Round the corner is the Golden triangle where you have Saks, Neiman Marcus and Barneys that are all quite samey and stocked very little specialty of the region. IE cool LA born cosmetic lines etc... So in short the same as any other designer shopping in the world really.Love the OMA Prada building. That was worth seeing. Plus the staff in Dior Homme were really nice and helpful about other shops to visit in LA.Don't expect anything out there but do expect a shopping stroll in nice weather down pristine streets and great customer service.",Bobbyboysabout

30,Window Shopping anyone?,This is about all you can do - window shop. The prices are horrifically high - even for shoppers such as myself who regularly shops at Short Hills Mall in NJ. Very hard to get parking in the area - we parked 6 blocks away in a residential section and walked over. I thought it was very cool that while window shopping on Rodeo Drive you get to cross the street diagonally.

The great weather, the beautiful palm trees, the luxurious stores, and the wealth men/women who frequent them. Everytime a nice car would roll by, I was constantly wondering which celebs were in it. It was definitely an exciting area.Very touristy of course, but not overly crowded like NYC. The salesmen and saleswomen were not pretentious/rude/snobby like I was expecting (mostly from the movie Pretty Woman). They all seemed very helpful and optimistic to make a sale.Great experience.

Visited all the stores....great service at Ralph Lauren - bought shirt and they steamed it so I could wear it out. Juicy Couture gave my daughter a ton of attention and made her feel important. Toms was a disappointment - 2 staff upstairs with one customer and I was ignored for 10 mins before I walked out. There was a Mediterranean restaurant around the corner that served great sandwiches.

20,Only for gawking at money,"If you get aroused by items that are very expensive (even if they were made with what is basically slave labor), then this destination is for you.

40,"Shopping, Pretty Woman Style","Rodeo Drive is a lovely place to shop if your taste is high end. It is only three blocks long, but it gives the true feel of the Beverly Hills shopping experience.

40,A must see while in Beverly Hills.,"When you live or have lived here it is an everyday occurence to see celebs walking around to locals not such a big deal. But if you are visiting for the first time it can be exciting. rodeo dr has great restaurants in the area and of course fantastic shopping. And you never know who you might see, so keep your eyes open.",pmlm M
50,See who you can see!,"I wholeheartedly agree that no visit to Beverley Hills is complete with a trip to Rodeo Drive!

40,my fave movie,"I had to visit Rodeo Drive because of my all time favourite movie Pretty Woman. Well, it's very posh, especially along Via Rodeo, where it is well represented in the movie as ultra exclusive and expensive....

We had nice little check-it-out kind of visit.",Grace P

40,Great even if your not going to buy anything,"Can't miss walking Rodeo Dr! even if your not planning on spending any money its still fun to do, lots of really expensive cars, flash shops and possibly a famous person! I heard when there is a famous person in a store security guards are at the door refusing anyone else entry till the star leaves - so if you get this I'd suggest hanging around outside to see who was inside!!!We didnt see any famous people nor did we buy anything but its still worth it. There is free parking just up from the parking building.",Cassie-Andy
50,"It's like being in a fictional city, Rodeo is that perfect",You can't have enough of a great experience on Rodeo. From the shops to the convenience of being near great restaurants to the beauty you experience just walking up and down the street. It is as perfect as it can get.,Marc B

50,Great boutiques despite the tourists,"Rodeo Drive and Via Rodeo are lined with the best luxury boutiques in the world. The best labels line the street and it is wide and easy to walk.It really is a label junkie's paradise with the latest fashions and stock from brands such as Chanel, Prada, Gucci and Dior. Brooks Brothers has a great store as does Ralph Lauren. More exclusive brands such as Lana Marks are also present.Sandwiched between Valentino and Michael Kors is the Luxe Hotel which is reasonably priced and while the rooms are tiny, it is a great central spot to stay.Rodeo Drive also meets up with Wilshire Blvd which has the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and Saks, Barneys and Neiman Marcus department stores.At the other end of Rodeo is the Museum of radio and television which is worth a visit. Restaurants are located in the streets which run parallel if you want lunch or dinner.While it is a bit of a tourist attraction, one can still shop and stroll amongst the best labels in the world and that is really fun.I have been numerous times over the years and enjoy it everytime I go.",liberty037

50,Loved it; just how a forienger images LA!,"To be honest, even if you're not going to buy anything i think Rodeo Drive is worth a look. For people visiting LA for the first time, it's what you envisage; attractive lookibg streets, high end shops,impressive cars, unlike most other parts of LA. it was my first visit to LA and i really enjoyed the experience. We had a nice time strolling the streets and popping in shops. The shops weren't unaffordable at all (though bot fir those on a tight budget). There were really good sales when i was there. For example, i bought a handbag from BSGM for $180 reduced from $360. Sure, Chanel etc are going to be massively expensive, that should be obvious, but BSGM, Guess etc, are fine and actuallt good value at sale time.",Michelle T

20,Boring... over rated.,"IM not in to giving poor reviews, but this place is just boring, not much to it... a bunch of shops that are over priced... i understand that is what it is all about, but other than looking in shops, there is no attraction here. just walk up and down a shopping strip. no Cafe's or restaurants. i guess this place is not for every one, and it is definitely not for me, no moments that made my time here bad other than i simply thought it was boring and over rated.",Simage82
40,On the Bucket List!,"Was always curious about Rodeo Drive, had a opportunity while visiting family in Beverly Hills. Lots of beautiful shops, very high end.

50,ALL EXPENSIVE SHOPS OF FAMOUS FASHION NAMES,"I liked it very much although only window shopping for me as very expensive. Famous names of fashion like Cucci,Valentino, Armani, Versace, Loui Vitton, Cartier, Chanel, Tiffany, Roberto Cavalli, Iceberg and many others are here.

It's good to see what is the latest in each designer store before buying elsewhere for cheaper. Rodeo drive is not really for shopping, it's more for window shopping and posing - for these two,things it score 100 out of 100!!! Apart from the shops there are numerous awesome restaurants each serving great quality food in great portions (I've reviewed many of the restaurants around Rodeo Drive separately).",DMyers148

50,What a Blast!,"We had a fabulous time meandering down Rodeo Drive. It was fun to peek in the shops and the ones we entered were so accommodating. While in the Gucci store we were given a lesson on the different types of materials used in handbags. The Tiffany's doorman actually waved us in and teased us about charging to look. We really enjoyed the stroll down the street and found everyone, tourists included, to be friendly and polite.",KniteRiter

20,Been there done that (Rodeo Dr),"Okay, so everyone for the most part has heard of Rodeo Dr...and of course many would like to see it. I must say, now that I've been there and done that, it isn't anything worth seeing. The area is very crowded and is filled with many stores most people don't shop at...well, minus Gap. Oh, and if you're looking for a bite to eat then this isn't the place. One thing we were impressed with is the several parks just off Rodeo Dr, one of which has a large display saying ""Beverly Hills"". These parks are very nice and peaceful, a nice contrast to Rodeo Dr.",TruthfulCritic85
30,"Not for Shopping, for people/car watching","Rodeo Drive is truly a must for seeing the people wanting to be seen. Rodeo Drive is perhaps the only drive where people are, for the most part absent, except in their cars. It is fun to sit in Panini, a great sidewalk cafe, and watch the cars. Unbelieveably, the area is the noisest area, with drivers constantly honking horns. Having travelled to NYC where you expect noise, Rodeo Drive seems oddly loud in Southern California. People wanting to be noticed honk their horns for no reason. This just has to be part of the Rodeo Drive ""cultural experience."" Lonely Rodeo Drive with horns honking is halarious. Panini is great, Grill on the Alley is superb, but for shopping, go to New York or Chicago. For people watching, Rodeo Drive is fun, if you don't have anything better to do.",RikiUSA
40,A place to people and car watch,"No longer a horse path, Rodeo Drive is home to some of the most exclusive shops. While you can find great products, the best is to watch the people and cars trying to impress or just wanting to be noticed. Sit at Blvd in the Beverly Wilshire, have a glass of wine and watch the parade of endlessly interesting sights.",SBF2

40,5 Tourist must do!,"Whether u want to shopping or window shopping, u must visit this rodeo drive. The product is really different from the usual store. I bought a bag and watch in michael kors in here, and never see the item before in the other michael kors store. The seller said because they r lifestyle store, so the product is different. The price range is higher coz its different product. If u want a special or limited u muat shopping in here",Vania A
50,Worth a look...,"This is the most posh part of LA I saw on my trip & to be honest although we were only there for a couple of hours, its worth a look & is a nice walk for people watching. Best bit I saw was a brand new Lamborghini Aventador in Rose Red left sitting with the engine running (to keep the air con running I think) opposite Luis Vitton whilst the guy was in the shop (so tempting to drive...). It's surprising how the shops & street in this part look like something out of a movie set, everything is in the right place, fire hydrants are chromed & some are matched to the colour of the building to seamlessly blend in. Opposite Rodeo Drive is the Beverly Hills sign which nice for a picture & further on are the mansions, again, worth a 5 min drive to see how the other half live.",Jables89
40,A Fashionista's Playground!,"I can't help but to think about the movie, ""Pretty Woman"" when I visit the famous Rodeo Drive! LOL! Rodeo Drive, probably one of the most famous streets in the world definitely lives up to the hype! This street is a ""fashionista's"" paradise!Rodeo is filled with high-end stores pretty much geared towards the rich & famous! But if you are not rich or famous (yet), Rodeo is still a lovely place for a nice walk, window- shopping, photo ops, or to have a nice lunch!The parking for Rodeo Drive can get a bit expensive, but they do have parking garages that are a couple of $$ an hour! Also, if you walk to the entrance of Rodeo, you'll see the famous, ""Beverly Hills"" sign! Have that camera ready and snap away!",TheJetsetter00
50,Nice Walk,"It was nice to be able to walk along the famous Rodeo Drive. It was crowded in some spots but there are a lot of places to stop along the way and shop. Everything was quite clean though and there were police in the area, walking up and down the street. Must see!",hafor
50,BEST Street I have visited in all of AMERICA,"WOW. . . I felt like I died and went to Heaven or I felt like I was in Monaco when I was on Rodeo Drive. It was like living in a Fairytale Dream for the day. Steinway, Van Cleif, Vidal Sasoon, Beautiful fountains and staircases, AMAZING!!! This street is everything you would expect and then some. DEFINATELY do take a stroll at leisure and spend the day taking in RODEO Drive and Beverly Blvd. Do not waste your time in Hollywood, you will be dissapointed but you can NEVER GO WRONG on Rodeo Drive, Trust me. ENJOY and take ltos of pics. You never know who you will run into. I could live this lifestyle with no problem. And, ooh the cars you see in this area, OMG it is truly amazing and beyond belief. ENJOY every minute there it is well worth it and you will have the memories to last a lifetime. You will leave with a smile, for sure",TRAVELDEB_10
50,Great for shopping and people-watching,"Contrary to the ""pretty woman"" myth, very friendly and accessible sales associates. This is the place to shop if you are looking for that popular/sold-out item, since they have more selection of everything here than anywhere else i've been, even Madison in NYC. Also, lots of beautiful venues to have a leisurely lunch. Take a few hours away from the fray and eat/shop here. Much more restful than the rest of LA.",Westmount

40,It's only worth going to satisfy yourself that you've been there & done it!,"Rodeo Drive looks very posh (and it is) but once you've walked up and down it, and then down a couple of the side streets, it's not the sort of place you're desperate to return to unless you have lots and lots of money. The shops just have big fancy recognisable names but not the sorts of places I would ever shop in (& still be able to afford the flight home). We didn't bother going in any. Its cool to get photos by some of the road signs & my wife wanted her photo outside the Beverley Wiltshire (A Pretty Woman moment!!). We spent about 2 hours in the area and that was enough. If you have children, that's certainly enough as Rodeo Drive means absolutely nothing to them so why force it on them? Great place to say you've been there and done it but that's as far as it goes. We didn't see anybody famous. Incidentally, if you're travelling from the Hollywood direction, you can catch the bus for $1.50 per person on Santa Monica Boulevard, Number 4 or 704. It will take you straight there. It also passes the Beverley Hills sign and - for the same price, you can stay on the bus and go all the way to Santa Monica Beach!! Have a nice time.",David M

Of course you're going to get attitude from some people around the area.... that's part of the experience where you just laugh it off. If you're a fashion forward type of person and have the money, then Rodeo Drive is your place to shop. Lots of tourists with camera's not paying attention, so be patient.",ljm192

Whilst you'd not be wrong in this, what surprised me was that actually most of it is residential, albeit no doubt also very expensive. As regards the shops, you know what to expect - if this type of over-priced, designer bling is your thing then ""knock yourself out"".

30,"No Shopping, Only Looking","When we took a tour of Hollywood and Beverly Hills, we were told by our guide that the shops on Rodeo Drive cost THOUSANDS every month just to rent, so shop owners were ""forced"" to hike up the prices of their products to absolutely ridiculous amounts. Of course, when we're talking about stores like Louis Vuitton, you're already going to pay somewhere around $850 for a scarf. So, unless you're very wealthy, I'm going to say you won't do much shopping here. Rodeo Drive is a fun place to wander around and people watch (or car watch). However, shopping? Not so much. I'm glad I went because I was able to take some pictures of iconic places and rare cars. We only went into one store, and the shop clerks were very rude and borderline hysterical about anyone touching any of the products (I didn't dare, but other patrons did). It made us feel antsy so we got out of there pretty fast. I'd say you could stop by for about half an hour, make the block, take some pictures, and say you've been there. Done.",bubblegum1286

There are resturants nearby. Worth stopping if you love to shop. Don't expect this to be like a trip to the average mall because its one of the most high end shoppnig districts.",beachbreeze66
20,Not Much to See,"I guess now I can say that I've been to Rodeo Drive, but that's about it. I realized that I wouldn't be able to afford to shop at the high end stores located there; however, I thought there would be more to it than there was. I thought there would be more glamour, but there were just a few blocks of expensive stores with nothing extravagant about the area. I was there on a Friday morning and it wasn't crowded. I saw a few expensive cars drive past, but didn't see any celebrities. I'm not sure what I expected, but it was a disappointment.",leah w
50,The best place to watch the real money and the pretenders.,Both Rodeo and the neighboring streets are jam-packed with high-end boutiques where you can see merchandise that is usually shockingly expensive. There are many restaurants often with patios where it's nice to sit and people watch. People watching is definitely the top pastime here.,PeterAZ
40,Fun for a quick stop.,"I am very into movies/famous people, so of course when I visited LA walking down Rodeo Drive was on my list because it is in so many movies and TV shows. It is what everyone says it is- very expensive shops. I do think that it lives up to all it's hype, giving you a good Hollywood experience. Even as I was walking outside of Gucci, a huge crowd was waiting for Christiano Ronaldo to come out- so there is a chance you could see a star!",travelgal12698

50,OMG!,"I have been dying to go here and finally I did. I loved it! It lives up to the hype. Yes, most of the shops are too expensive for the average person. But, oh, the window shopping! Each store is unique and different and if you decide to go into a store liike Prada or Chanel, you are treated with respect. Appaarently, clerks are told to expect lookers, not buyers, and that you never know who you're dealing with. You just never know who is going to buy. If only every store got this into clerk's heads, shopping would be a nicer experience. This is a must see!",Lynda L

If youve never been to LA I highly recommend a visit..Though I've never been to Hong Kong or the orient at all, I have been in most major cities and have never seen anything like this..NYC comes close, with 5th avenue, but it is severely lacking palm trees and the hip hollywood hipsters that you see on Rodeo. A great summary, we called a good friend who is very well traveled, but had never been here. We told him of the Patek-Phillipe watch store, and his response was: You mean they have a whole store full of Patek-Phillipe watches???? Now, you get the idea!!!",_RichieT_Pa_

The walk and the views are nice. We felt very uncomfortable when we walked into some of the stores, except for the Coach store, they were very nice. It seemed like the staff of some of the other stores were looking down their noses at us and did not make us feel welcomed. I guess they are used to people coming in and not buying anything. A few of the stores are ""by appt only"". I certainly would not go here to shop.... I'll take the outlet stores ;), but it is one of those American icon's to say ""been there, done that"".",Diane C

50,You don't need to break the bank,"Go to Rodeo Drive and spend sometime at the famous Nate & Al's deli where you may see producers, directors and stars having breakfast or lunch.

30,Not much Excitement unless you have lots of $$$$$,"Seeing Rodeo drive was something I always wanted to do. I thought I might even see a celebrity but that was not to be. The area was very unimpressive other than all of the super expensive stores were there. Most have guards at the door and that is intimidating when you know you just want to go in and look. I checked out TUMI luggage store and found a very nice little travel carry-on for only $895! My Wal-Mart version cost $32 and works just fine. Most of the people were tourists as I was, not many went into any stores, probably for the same reasons. If you have never been there take a chance and plan to walk one end to the other which is about a half hour. Then, you can say you were there. Otherwise, it was no big deal, but fun being there on the off chance of seeing a celebrity walk in or out of a store.",OpinionGuru

There are several garages and the 1st two hours are free at the ones that I've seen.

There are also some restaurants including The Cheesecake Factory.",MayaD888

50,Best High End Shopping,Amazing scenic shopping area with all of the best high end designers in the world. The Prada and Louis Vuitton stores are quite large. Many of the stores offer you Perrier water or Champagne while you shop. It is quite common to see Bentleys and Ferraris driving by. A fun lunch break can happen at the Beverly Wilshire.,SBLAW
50,Afternoon on Rodeo,"Rodeo Drive is a great place to spend an afternoon. Numerous movies have been shot there, but it is much more than a tourist attraction. There are many lavish shops and restaurants, and a popular spot for the stars.

30,Overrated,Beside for it being the place where the stars shop there is nothing else really that great! The store are nice and offer many options but not at a bargain. I went into a store and found the same dress that I purchased prior to the trip at my local mall. On Rodeo drive it was marked up ten dollars more than the original price and I got mine for 40% off!,Lilihurdler5
50,The Best Shopping In The World?,"Yes, I will go that far in saying Rodeo Drive has the best luxury shopping in the world. Fifth Avenue and Le Champs Elyese are fantastic but Rodeo's weather and proximity to an entire collection of top stores is impossible to beat. The streets are pretty much paved with gold in Beverly Hills as its designed for both well-heeled tourists and locals to spend, spend, spend. Another cool detail about BH is no fast food. If you are in a hurry, eat a Mulberry Street Pizza or Sharky's (taco) but no McDonlad's and the like. For men's clothes I like Brioni best on Beverly Hills but there are no lack of stores to give exercise to your Black Card.",FlyersFanInLA
40,"Definitely a ""Tourist"" Attraction","This is one of THE places that every visitor to LA wants to see. That being said, the locals, especially the stars, avoid shopping on Rodeo Drive. So if you're looking for a movie star sighting, don't get your hopes up. You'll see more tourists wandering up and down the street just like yourself, snapping photos. However, the shops and atmosphere don't disappoint. It's a neat place to see and part of the Beverly Hills experience. There are some stores mixed in that are affordable. I bought my daughter a dress and jacket at Guess. It was no more expensive than shopping at this store at our local mall, but she can now say she has an outfit that was purchased on Rodeo Drive!Be sure and take a drive on the streets north of Santa Monica Blvd. to get a look at those Beverly Hills mansions.",Debbie M

40,Good for visitors,"Walking or driving down Rodeo, particularly for visitors, is totally something you have to do at some point, especially if you're a Pretty Woman fan. It doesn't take long unless you go into all the stores, but its a piece of LA you just have to do.",justtojess

30,Flashy but not interesting,This strip caters to the celebrity and social elite. It isn't welcoming to tourists and is really only a good time if you enjoy window shopping since the prices to actually buy anything are higher than a Las Vegas boutique. Not impressed with the snobby atmosphere. Nothing really interesting outside on the sidewalks so...wouldn't visit again.,Genee W
50,Rodeo Drive Window Shopping,It was fun window shopping all the upscale stores on Rodeo Drive. The windows are decked out with the most beautiful clothes and jewelry I have ever seen. The only draw back is my pocketbook did not match the prices of the articles. But a beautiful street and fun to watch all the people.,Mhood_VA
30,"A ""must visit"" if you're in the area","Just to say that you've been ON Rodeo Drive... you should park and walk up and down the street to see the posh shopping area that we so often see in movies and on reality tv shows.

50,Bring a credit card with a good limit...,"You'll find virtually all of the top designers in the world on this street. Some are 'off the charts', like Bijan (apparently the world's most expensive store - reservations only & a commitment to spend $300,000) while others are more reasonable.

I am fully aware that of the waiting list for these bags but hey guys get off your box remember everyone is a customer no matter who they are.Louis Vitton were great as my wife is regular customer of theres, and the service was great on Rodeo, and even got a discount from the sales lady.The guys in Tom Ford were great especially the young lady on the front the blonde one and the Manager was a cool guy and no doubt when we go back later this year we will meet up with him again and he was a Brit, all the people working in TF very nice people, and Mr. Ford you should be proud of these guys as are the guys in your London Store all cool people.The guy who parks his yellow Bugatti outside his shop thank god that at least it free to take pictures of his car, but I am sure that wont last too long as a visit to his shop just to look round will cost you $500, and a set of cases $400K at least I can drive a Ferrari which cost less, but I cant drive a set of suitcases.But worth while the visit to see how the very Rich and Famous like to solve the national debt LOL.A must do.",mannaitch

The area is filled with super expensive shops, and rude people, who are only nice to you if you have money. I find this area of Los Angeles to be uninteresting and precocious.",heumanntouch
30,"famous - and definitely worth the ""drive- through""","Like most folks, this place is too upscale for me. So it's definitely a nice idea to drive through Rodeo Drive and see the fancy cars, shops, and folks...",Chinadiggydoll
50,Better than Worth Avenue Palm Beach,Mostly because my favorite designer shop doesn't even need to have a sign. Great people watching and if you need an expensive pair of sneakers...well need I say more?,FTLHotelier
40,Fun place to visit,Rodeo drive is only a 3 block stretch so very easy to walk up and down in an hour or two. many tourists so don't worry about feeling out of place. A good place to park is at the north end by a park. We actually found a few reasonably priced sale items in one store. There are a few places with outside tables for lunch or a drink.,Jeff38094
50,Short and Expensive,"If you have money you will love to shop, otherwise its just fun to dream on this road !!!",ALISouthAustralia
30,Overrated,"The hype surrounding Rodeo Drive is not warranted, it is just another strip shopping centre with expensive shops and wanna be people walking around. You won,t see any stars, they go in the back entrance. It is filled with tourists and tour buses, at least we can say we saw it.",knowhowtotravel
50,Fantastic...,Perfect for a lovely stroll on a sunny Californian day! Don't forget your credit card..,bmattar
30,Great to be able to tick of the done list!,"just like you see i the shows/movies. dont go to the tiffany store, they have no idea what they are doing, very dissapointing. Judith leiber is fntastic if not just to look at all the bags on display. Cartier fantastic, great amount of interesting bling to look at and the staff are very compitent and great to deal with (listen up tiffany's) good to wlk down to perv on the cars! dont think that bugatti ever moves though and heads up the hale tale is up but realistically it dowsnt go up til you hit aound 80km'sso the owner is a poser on more than one level!!!",Louiserous
40,Shop Till You Drop,"The street where the movie ""Pretty Woman"" was in part shot. It's very expensive to shop there and seeing as most major cities have similar shops (e.g. 5th Ave, NYC, Magnificent Mile, Chicago, IL. ) there's really no reason to go out of your way to see this street when there is so much more to be seen in L.A.",samroz
40,"If you like designer boutiques, go here","Rodeo Drive is very famous but in essence is just a row of very exclusive, expensive designer boutiques - I'm not sure why so many tourists flock here. There are some excellent restaurants on Canon Drive though and the surrounding areas of Beverly Hills is nice - definitely worth a day trip and if you are interested in celebrity life book a open-top car tour around famous people's houses.",beachchick12

20,Meh,"I don't care much for designer labels, but thought I'd check out Rodeo Drive, which was fairly unspectacular. Yes, you see the odd Rolls Royce - but who cares?Tip - park at One Rodeo - they offer free valet parking for two hours. :)",hellofish
40,Fun Place to Window Shop!,"I walked through Rodeo drive on a Sunday evening, right as the shops were closing. It was a lot of fun to see the high end designer's styles on display.

40,"Gucci, Prada, & Louis Vuitton, Oh my!","Walking on Rodeo Drive is a definite do in Beverly Hills. No actual shopping is done here unless you have won the lottery. Surprisingly, there were no crowds of people on the sidewalks so it was a pleasant walk down this pretty street. Compared to Fifth Avenue, Rodeo Drive is not full of gawking tourists, but a much calmer scene and pace. Not your average main street but with designers galore and much more.",jb645
40,I shop up there about twice a year,"If you want to shop or just look at a lot of high-end and great stuff, go to Rodeo. Especially Stefano Ricci, Battaglia, Ralph Lauren, Hermes, Zegna. Carroll & Co. Well, heck. Go see all of them !! But be prepared to spend money. But STAY AWAY from Scott Hill Design !! He's a crook. He takes your money up front for custom clothes (if you're dumb enough to pay up front) and then fails to deliver.

50,True window shopping :),"We had a great time walking up and down Rodeo drive few evenings in a row. One can admire the good stuff through the store windows - as honest to God, there were more security guards inside than shop assistants! Even less customers... I was told that some days they have sales too... However, this is a place to see and enjoy. And if you can spare a few hundreds for a token something... why not? If you want to spend a few hours touring Hollywood and Rodeo Drive as well and hear the local stories and latest gossip - make sure to take one of the numerous double decker tours.",Vladimiramirela

40,Not as Snooty as its Reputation,"Sure, there are shops where only the Spelling family could shop but most are accessible to everyone. As for the aloofness portrayed in films, all it takes is a hello and conversation and suddenly class differences seem to melt away. You might even find out that the person selling you goods is from your old neighborhood. All the way across the country. So much for snooty. Break down the barriers and you'll feel right at home. Of course, being friendly won't get you any deals but you'll feel better about spending 6K on a watch! So I've heard...",BHinLA

50,We enjoyed seeing all the designers!,We strolled up and down just admiring all the beautiful clothes and things in the shop windows. I think anyone who is anyone has a store here. It is clean and a fun place to walk around. Did not buy anything but certainly enjoyed looking!,Donna C
50,Just like the movies!,Great place to walk around!! Def a must in Beverly Hills!,meaganlaura1
30,Closes at 6 PM,"Underwhelmed. Looks nice, but everything was closed by the time I arrived. It was like they rolled up the side walks. Will look for something else to occupy a few hours next time I'm in LA.",obmario
40,Very pretty but not all that exciting,"We walked around for maybe a half hour and that's we needed. The buildings, flowers, trees are all gorgeous, so for people that enjoy that it is nice to see! We didn't go in any stores but they were fun to walk past. We parked under ground in the most beautiful brick garage. They're only open til 6 but it was around $4-5 for under an hour which we didn't think was terrible. Overall, a must see site that won't actually take very long!",preppytraveler09
30,World Famous Rodeo Drive,"Just drove along Rodeo Drive through the district, and that was cool. I could see how parking could be an issue, and hardcore fashion enthusiasts wil certainly enjoy this more than those who aren't, but it's still cool to check out.",iamjasonmills
20,not the best place to shop,"I live 3 blocks from Rodeo Drive, but hardly shop in Rodeo Drive or Beverly hills , the sales persons are very pushy and do anything to sell you something, even if the clothing dose not fit you . many times I spent $5K or more the Hi end boutique and department stores ask you to come back for alteration after 3 weeks then either it is not ready or they make a mistake in measurement , plus many places charge for alteration",sisal08
30,Very nice if you have money to spend,"I think everybody should go and see it in LA, but don't expect to be going into the shops. It is all designer shops, so if you aren't rich, forget about it ! It's nice to see but don't expect to spend more than an hour there, and of course, don't forget to go and see the Beverly Hills sign which is nearby !",Tatiana016
50,fantastic shopping,Fantastic shopping and not crowded - it was so much cheaper than the same high end stores in Australia. Enjoyed every minute of it,panda267

30,"The tourist part is great, the shopping part... I've seen better",I went to Rodeo Drive because it was the thing to do in Beverly Hills. I have to say that I wasn't impressed. I grew up in Chicago and was familiar with the high end stores. I've shopped on 5th Avenue in NYC and was more impressed with that than Rodeo Drive. The people working in the stores act like they own the place and were extremely rude to me. The area of shopping in nice with regard to looks and cleanliness. There are celebrities walking around if you look closely... try Starbucks if that is what you are there to see. I'd recommend taking a tour rather than shopping here. Everything has a premium price tag as they know people will pay it just to say that they shopped on Rodeo Drive. Parking can be a bit of a challenge but there are garages nearby.,flowergirl3785
30,Is this it?,The world famous Rodeo Drive shopping area was not impressive. Just a small area of luxury stores. It took us longer to park our car than to walk through the shopping area.,JacobE78
50,I can say I have shopped on Rodeo Drive!,"Every girl (who likes shopping that is) dream to wander down Rodeo Drive, yes it it one street that is perfectly clean & tidy with extremely nice shops.

Even my partner enjoyed the stroll from one end to the other.If you are in LA its a must (even if you only drive down it).",orchid028
20,nothing special,it really isn't anything great about this. people used to rave about this back in the 80's and 90's.it just a small shopping avenue with tourists. it really isn't anything special.,julieannboo
40,Worth a visit,"Spent an hour or two walking around all the expensive shops. It's fun to go into the stores and window shop. My boyfriend enjoyed all of the expensive cars that were parked along Rodeo Dr. Was hoping to see a celebrity, but no luck!",AZ_432
50,Gawker's delight.,"Gentle. Easy. Fun. Go to your thesaurus and you can add to the list. Allow a generous hour to stroll up and down the three blocks of the heart of Rodeo Drive's haute couture shops. If you start a little before eleven, you'll be ready for a lunch break before the real rush begins and you can get a table with a view. If you are just a window shopper and sightseer, this could be the best value in the country.",WestonMOCook

30,Check in the box -- I've been,"My husband and I are relatively new to Southern California, so we decided to take a day trip up to Los Angeles and ""do the Beverly Hills thing."" We found free parking underneath the Pottery Barn one or two streets over. It was either two or three hours free (I can't remember!), but the time was more than adequate -- no validation by Pottery Barn required.We did visit the Mikimoto store since we're in the market for some good quality pearl studs. We told the salesman (Douglas -- great guy!) up front that we weren't going to buy anything that day, but probably would within the next few months. He was very helpful, attentive, and informative, and even offered to let me try on the 8mm AAA studs! He gave us his card and told us to call when we were ready to order, but he wasn't pushy at all, and neither did we feel rushed or like we were being a bother.Rodeo Drive is a great place to go just to say you've been there. We're glad we went, but it's not something we loved so much that we'd go weekly or monthly or anything.",MrsRon
40,Great photo opportunity!!,"Rodeo Drive is a great place to go for people watching. I wouldnt recommend this to those not ultra-rich for shopping, as the stores add extra to the price tag purely because of where they are.Dont go there looking for famous celebrities, as its mainly tourists hoping to see celebrities!We did see some fab cars parked along the main drag though!",Ceri M
40,a must do in beverly hills,"It's a very cool place to go, even if you can't afford to buy something. It's a beautiful street, with great cars passing buy, and you may bump into something famous (I saw Queen Latifah). There are plenty of places to park (but some of them are expensive). A great place to lunch is 208 Rodeo, with a great view of the Beverly Wilshire - great service.",htsec
40,Wonderful Photo/Memory Op,"We stopped to take pictures and say we've been. We knew we weren't going to buy anything and wouldn't spend very long there.

40,Great to say I've Been,"We stopped here really as a picture opportunity. We had to say we have been to Rodeo drive. We took pictures of all the desginer stores and of course the ""Regent Beverly Wilshire"" hotel. This is thehotel featured in the movie ""Pretty Woman"" There is also an offical town greeter here. This guy is dressed in a top hat and red coat, he can apparently say hello in over 100 languages. He was asking where people were from and saying hello in their language. We didn't see him get any wrong.If you want to shop here bring plenty of money. We were told there isa huge mark up on items sold on Rodeo, just because you are on Rodeo.You can get the same thing elsewhere much cheaper.",dragonjulie
50,A favorite from my trip to L.A.!,"While Rodeo Drive isn't where most of us will be doing a lot of shopping, this area is a must-see for anyone traveling to the L.A. area for the first time. The buildings and landscaping are absolutely gorgeous, the people are friendly, and you never know who you're going to run into (Victoria Beckham was at Saks during our visit). We found a great little chocolate shop near the temporary Fendi store just off Rodeo (I can't remember the name - sorry!). It was so good we went back for another treat the next day. We also ate our best meal while in L.A. during our trip to Rodeo Drive. The restaurant, 208 Rodeo, was amazing. And we were lucky enough to snag an outside terrace table that overlooks Rodeo Drive (see photo).",PlayingFavorites
50,For Designer Names- Stop Here,Rodeo Drive is great to window shop. I have actually shopped at Tiffany's. People are very nice and there are lots of tourists around to take your pic. It's fun to get a taste of the good- er- um- the RICH life.,bbb92
50,The Next Hollywood Blvd.,"I'd always deliberately avoided Beverly Hills during my previous visits to L.A. I assumed the place was boring and pretentious. When I finally did visit B.H., two things about it surprised me. The first was how many other low rent tourists---people just like me---were already there. The sidewalks overflowed with gawkers. Not all of them were working stiffs, like me, but enough of them were dressed in mass merchandise shorts and t-shirts that I didn't feel out of place. (With all the proletarians roaming about, I doubt if there was a star within a mile of Rodeo Dr. that afternoon.) The other surprise was how much I liked the place. Downtown B.H. is a very walkable neighborhood. There are interesting sights, the streets are pedestrian-friendly, traffic is tolerable and the area is clean.",booradley2
