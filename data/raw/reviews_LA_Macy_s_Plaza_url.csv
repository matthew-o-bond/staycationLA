40,Close to the Metro Station!,Close to the Metro Station! Convenient to shops and restaurants. Best thing to say it‚Äôs close to the subway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
10,Horrible Surroundings And Lazy Staff,"I understand that the weather in LA can be quite hot, but that is no excuse for staff to be lazy and unhelpful! Particularly in the cosmetic section, I found the staff to be very inattentive and knew almost nothing about the products they were selling.Also at the time I visited, the area was heavily under construction.Worst Macy's that I have visited so far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983stevey
40,Good Place for Brands Shopping to Locals as well as Tourists,My daughter studying in LA likes this for her clothing. We too went there to buy cloths. We find very good collection of reputed brands with discounts. Its location in Downtown is easily accessed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
30,Validated parking makes it somewhat tolerable,"Most of us in Los Angeles don't want to go downtown (homeless and horrible traffic) and going there for a Macys when there are plenty around in more convienient areas seems like a waste of time. However, downtown Macys does validate its parking so an occassional visit is OK. The store seems large and rather quiet. there were few in the store when we were there (thursday in the early afternoon) One can walk around in the store and then wander outside to see whatever is new around there...however, be careful and watch out for the homeless sprawled on the sidewalks...don't step on them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
20,small store in a construction zone; avoid,This store is a small Macys that I would have expected to find in a remote location. Most of the surrounding stores are under construction. there are both homeless and construction workers viewing for your attention as you approach the store. There re surely better places in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waiake1

30,Oasis in LA,"Located in front of Macy‚Äôs (of course) and behind the Sheraton Grand Hotel, this is a pleasant public space with places to sit. Starbucks and a few other restaurants and shops are also tied into this area. The 7th Street/Metro station is also located underneath.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsj5777
50,Stunningly beautiful with a selection of shops for all,Stunningly beautiful with a selection of shops for all. This has been well thought out in design. When you stand back and admire the architecture of how they've used reflections to make an ever bigger space is rather clever. There was a DJ playing when we visited which only added to the atmosphere. From a fancy Starbucks to a super sized Macey's you name it this place has it all. If in area well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlainac2015
40,Convenient if you're at the Sheraton,"A good place to shop for a few extras if you're staying at the Sheraton, but not much else other than the Macy's store here. Food trucks and a DJ come and go, which makes it a bit more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizF12345
40,Close shopping,We stayed at the sheraton which is right next to this plaza. It was nice to have purely for convinence shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
20,Nothing Special. Same ole; Same ole!,"With all the hoopla about the owners renovating the plaza, I found it all very lacking. The Macy's store is a mini-version with limited men's brands. The outside plaza is only about 10% occupied due to construction but even when 100% leased, I can't see this location as being a destination for locals or tourists. When you enter the garage, it seems like you have to drive up and around 7 floors to find guest parking. Seems like nothing has changed at this corner of Flower. Wasted time for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Great2TravelCA
50,Enjoyed,The plaza is currently under construction. Will be nice when complete to match the downtown LA decor. Nice location and the typical Macy's inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShawnRH185
40,It was convenient,"Staying at the Sheraton Hotel, it was great to see Macy next to it. Although not very attractive with the remodelling outside but once inside it was shopping as usual. Very glad with the convenience and found some items to buy. Happy Shopper!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runcation4fun
50,Magnificent Macy's,"Macy's in Los Angeles is one of the highlights of any travelers trip to the city, a big department store with much on offer. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643ricz
30,Older Macy's is Being Upgraded ...,"This downtown Macy's anchor store location has been outdone by its many Mall & Galeria locations, thus the current upgrade in progress is underway. Stopped in to grab an item while downtown. It's a bit worn in a worn area, but the remodel should help, plus more folks are moving back into the area. Good luck! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,No reason unless you're living or hotel and need macys stuff...,"Old school building and exterior architecture.Modern flavored interior is in the process of remodel. Great interior skylight in construction areas. Will be cool when it's completed.Under remodel, no reason to come here unless living--hotel stay downtown and you need standard macy's style clothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,The Best Magazine,"Macy is the best maganize to buy all the tme, has it all and their staff are excelementes in attendance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mreis_bra
20,Quiet dull,The look and feel is a bit dated. I didnt feel any attraction to shop at all. Also toilet facilities is a bit old. Facade is under construction at this point which hopefully will improve the shopping experience in the future!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceSin
20,very underwhelming shopping center,"If you are stuck in downtown los angeles yeah this would be your place to shop. However, for better deals and more variety you should visit the outlying malls. Its anchored by a macy's department store which has a nice selection of midrange goods. The place really exists for the downtown work crowd. For those without a car i would suggest using the www.mta.net site and figuring out the bus system to visit the citadel outlets for discount shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
40,Buy one get many free,"A great store that offer a plenty of varities of clothing, accessories, footwears etc. we love to shop,again in Macy's, unfortunately we had leads time to shop again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_kakkasserys
50,GREAT SHOPPING,Loved the shopping everything at great prices and very friendly staff. Shop shop shop til you drop. Awesome ranges of clothing and great brands. Loved the staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loganm618
50,My fav shopping mall,"Before my arrival in Los Angeles, I looked online the things that I would like to buy and made a lists. The Mall is not far from my sisters house, so its really a pleasure to start the day here at the Mall. We ate first in one of the famous eatery and then I started shopping. Macy's has everything you would want in a shop, prices are already marked down, but still an additional marked off the already reduced price. and so so cheap compared back in Australia. I bought signatures watches, my best buys and so so happy with the purchase. Shop assistants are helpful and friendly, and the Mall is quite clean. Lots and lots of casual dining and the prices are again, so cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maganda0411
40,This is soooo convenient - in downtown!,"Who would have expected a mini shopping mall right in the downtown area? It is so convenient to your downtown hotel, and has a decent mix/variety of stores that anything you need you should be able to find it here somewhere. It even includes a branch of the US Postal Service! (but the post office was closed on Saturday, just when I needed it!!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCitytraveler701
30,A Mall is a Mall,Same Old same old. Malls are the same everywhere. This one had a lot of empty store fronts. Macy's is not enough to draw visits from out-of-towners.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyallanstewart
40,Shopping,"The Plaza does not have a great many shops, but was clean and welcoming. Macy's was fairly well stocked and goods were priced across the range, with some good items on sale. Staff were helpful and friendly for the most part. For a mall of only this size it was a pleasurable shopping trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnes982
20,"Weird ""downtown"" L.A. mall","This mall-like the 7th and Fig mall a block away--is a weird, empty place. There aren't many stores, and everything's a bit cheezy and second-rate. The restaurants on the lower level are absolutely bizarre.(Some of them are not bad for a quick lunch, though. Check out the sushi place!) There is something so sad about Los Angeles--you keep looking for a big city, and you never find it. I've seen better malls in Mississippi and Wisconsin. There is no downtown Los Angeles. If you want to go to a mall, hit the 'burbs. If you want an exciting big city urban center with interesting one-of-a-kind stores, leave Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeTrotting20379
