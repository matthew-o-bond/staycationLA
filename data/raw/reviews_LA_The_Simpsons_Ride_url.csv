40,Loved it-simulator ride,We loved this ride. Massive Simpsons fans and it’s a great simulator ride. You can take all your bags with you because you just leave it to the side the and the cart goes up and then comes back down. I love the area where you pine up for the ride too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaM646
40,Funny,Great concept of a ride. It’s actually a simulator but funny and enjoyable! Suitable for all ages in the family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duerds5
30,Motion Simulator fun,"Hi Guys... This is another simulator ride Which replaced the original ""Back to the Future"" ride. It's the exact same set up.. Just Simpson's style. You go on board with the Simpsons and try to avoid Sideshow Bob who is trying take Bart... It's a jerky up and down simulator ride within all different levels of the stadium. Wait time is usually long. I actually was a little dizzy on this ride for some reason. It's a non track ride unlike Transformers & Spiderman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathami86
50,Hilarious Fun,"This ride is not only fun once you board the ride but EVEN the line itself entering this ride is so much fun. The signs all about are HILARIOUS. Don't miss reading a single one. The cartoons you're shown while you're in line are extremely funny and entertaining also. This is the old ""Back to the Future"" ride refurbished. That was a great ride. This ride really has its own unique character. Its a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
30,Funny,"It´s a fun ride as well, but I´m going to say the same I say for all the rides: The lines are a nightmare and the price per person to enter the park is 129 bucks. A real rip-off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabesua
50,Fun Ride!,This is a cute ride and the carnival theme is consistent throughout. Fun experience for The Simpsons fans and non-fans alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165sabrinau
30,SPRINGFIELD!!!,Ya gotta get your Simpson's ride on when you are at universal studios. those fans of the TV show will enjoy the cartoon elements of the ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
30,Should Still Be Back To The Future,This ride is just a reworking of the original Back to the future ride. Extremely long queues and very disinterested staff members.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
10,Hate that ride!,"I was do disappointed when they took down the Back to the future ride and when I found out this was the replacement, I couldn't believe it. The ride made me so nauseous and it is terrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
40,Cute ride!,"The wait was finally reasonable enough for us to stand in line and wait to ride the Simpsons ride. They take you into a room beforehand and give you the normal speech about who should and shouldn't ride, but in a Simpsons sort of way. I found it hilarious. :) The ride itself was good, but I won't be riding it again. I do have minor motion sickness, but this ride brought it out big time. A few times I had to look down and focus on a spot to make that feeling go away. We all liked it, but 3 of 5 people in our group (1 adult, 2 teens) got different levels of motion sickness on this ride. So, if you have any motion sickness or vertigo issues, I would not ride. Overall, a cute ride though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ugadogs1992
30,Starting to be a bit old,"This ride really needs a refurbish. Queues are really long and slow, the capacity and cycle time for the ride is not good.The ride was nice 10 years ago, but the age starts to show with this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
40,Excellent Attraction,Really cool attraction with great theming throughout. The queue is quite plain until you get into the pre show room. The ride was excellent with a great flowing storyline. The only downside is the graphics are quite poor. The actual attraction should be avoided for those with motion sickness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldkam
50,The Simpsons,Have been a huge fan of The Simpsons so was super excited about the ride and everything around. Undoubtedly one of the best rides in Universal studios so don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sachin_Zarekar
40,Not bad!,"I was able to do the queue and my wife rode the ride. As I cannot take the impact. I love the theming in the queue. They could have done more, but it was ok.The reports on the ride are same as others, 4D and well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB336
40,Ride Full of action and fun,"Sideshow Bob has escaped and taken over Krusty Land. This 5 minute animated ride takes you on a journey as Bob tries to destroy the Simpsons. Maggie has entered a nuclear reactor and grown to a giant. 8 riders at a time enter a vehicle for the fun ride through Krusty Land that uses animation, smoke, water and smells. Entry is through the large Krusty Land entrance, unless you have Front of the Line, where you enter to the left. All of the Simpson characters appear on this ride.An action packed ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OziDiver
