30,Short visit may not be worth it,"We didn't have time to walk the 1.7 miles trail since we are on a time limit with our golf cart rental. We only did a short walk from the entrance of the garden to the gate on top of the hill. It's a short walk and the view from the gate is very nice. But there really isn't much else to see . The garden trail had various plants, but it was short. The fee is cheap enough, $8 for adult and $6 for senior, that we just considered it donation. But short visit may not be worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619yenw
40,Worth the walk,Walk is a little over 1.7 miles with about 500 ft gain in elevation. Not a lot to do but it’s nice to see the plants and the view from the memorial is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TFontheroad
50,Gigantic Plants,Taking the paths through the various gardens allow you to appreciate the size plants can achieve in such a marine environment. Plants were well labeled and this place provides a peaceful get-away from other activities on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnniversaryVoyager
50,Nice selection of Cacti,Nice variety of cacti. Meandering paths a Vista points. The memorial is worth the climb. Great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RicMardi
10,Awful Experience,We were denied entrance with a Service dog. She isn’t a pet.. she is a working dog. I’m a Marine Corps Veteran.Never have I ever been treated so terribly. 0 stars if we could for us. Not worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1943IPj
50,Just so beautiful,He was wonderful walking through seeing the Bell tower and all the flowers and plants it was just a wonderful experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3679KXwilliamk
10,Mediocre Monument and Gardens,They now want $8.00 to see this lousy monument and gardens. I was there 20 years ago and it has not changed except for increased fee. My family group still wanted to go there so I could not say no. Pretty benign and gardens are just cactus. Pretty bad for a family that is so wealthy. The view is not good either. Take the $2.00 bus up and walk back and stop at the free nature center if you go. Go around lunchtime when the person is not there collecting money and get in for free. It is not worth it otherwise. Wear walking shoes and prepare for dusty dirty conditions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpg33tar
50,Wonderful afternoon!,Great way to spend a relaxing hour or so learning about this island’s vegetation. We did a leisurely stroll up from town first stopping at the Nature Center then continuing on up the Botanical Garden. Recommend it highly if you want to get away from the Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950davew
50,Feel like you're far away,"So completely worth the $8 to walk through the plants and up to the memorial, with a lovely ocean view. Be sure to take a lot of water—especially if you are going to hike the trail up to the ridge to look over the other side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbonze
40,Cute little botanical garden,We walked all the up here from our hotel on beach. Cute place with a lot of native Catalina plants and other plants from various locations. Beautiful memorial with view of ocean from very top. Great exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinmom8
30,Not worth the price & not much to see!,"Little place, not much to see. would be better if they planted more native plants and added a couple more exhibits. Not worth the time or money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southerncaligirl72
40,Great way to appreciate Nature,"Pricey to gain admittance however it is a good way to see the local plant and wildlife. We saw one fox, allot of birds, and great plants. The monument isn’t that special but still interesting. This is a great stop if you’re taking one of the golf cart self guided tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dupont2Traveler
30,Overall Setting: +; Memorial: Interesting; Garden: Meh,"It's nice to have a beautiful area a little more than a mile from the hustle and bustle of downtown Avalon. If you decide to go there, our suggestion is to take the local bus both to and from the memorial and garden . . . we took the bus to but not back. It's not a long walk but has little to recommend itself except that it's good exercise. We found the Wrigley Memorial to be interesting architecturally and artistically -- not wonderful but good to have seen. The gardens? We were disappointed. The cactus and succulent portion was quite nice but the rest wasn't very interesting -- maybe May wasn't the best time to visit it -- and it didn't seem well maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesB9722ER
20,"Not worth the time, effort or expense.","I really wanted to like this place. The gardens are nice, with a good collection of local and other islands flora. But the memorial itself is unimpressive. The pink and green marble and tile carvings look like an attempt to mimic ancient Roman and or Greek memorial, but comes up way short. The memorial portion feels like the last gasp of a very rich family trying to purchase a legacy through art, without any quality artistry.Having said that, I do appreciate the sanctuary and the effort to promote wildlife, especially Southern California wildlife.But this is not a ‘must see’ attraction in Catalina. For the time, effort and cost of admission, it’s not really worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justin44
40,Fun to do once,"Located way at the end of the canyon this is a very beautiful place. The flowers are stunning, the birds chirp and the Mauselum is very historic and peacful. A nice respite from busy Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goodness4you
50,Great visit!,Loved this self guided tour or this place. Nice walkabout on a beautiful day! Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and highly recommend it to all visitors (if you live nature like werm do)!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHFTIZ
30,Nothing Special,"Unless one has a great interest in the plants of Catalina or architecture, the price is excessive. The view from the memorial was nice. The gardens and the memorial did not appear well maintained. There were several videos about Catalina just inside the entrance. We found them to be more promotional than informative. There is a public bus route from town: $2 each way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomonaAndLyle
20,Don't waste your money and time,"Even though the hike till the memorial and botanic garden is interesting, the place is a serious let down. Walk around SantaMonica streets and you'd find a wider variety of plants than in the botanic garden. The entry ticket of 8 USD per person, is maybe used to take care of the memorial of wrigley. Honestly, neither the memorial or the garden are anything special. I would suggest go on some trails. Don't waste your money and time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umayrmasud
30,Good views,Worth walking up here for the views and access to the garden to sky hiking trail. The Wrigley memorial monument is very impressive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monicamermaid
50,Well Maintained & beautiful views,"We walked up the hill through downtown Avalon. Lovely walk all the way up. The attendant was not there when we arrived (about 12:50pm) and had left a sign that she would be back at 1pm. There was also a sign that you could drop the money in the box & go in on your own. We didn't have correct change, so we waited & she was there promptly at 1pm. Great! Most plants & trees were identified & the paths were clear & maintained. The Memorial is in pretty good shape & the view down through the town was lovely. Worth the visit. We had intended to do the hike to the ridge over the Memorial, but decided to wait for another time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pshurd
40,Garden,The visit here had us taking a good walk. We enjoyed the native vegetation examples. A nice staff answered questions. Well worth the stop on our Catalina visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6713TXmarkt
40,Very nice property,"A large piece of property with a great garden and a very large memorial building. Interesting cactus garden. The building itself is ornate with tile. Very cool. I thought I was in a mausoleum, and sure enough, Wrigley was entombed there for awhile. They have a marble plate where he used to be. It kind of blows your mind he would spend all this money so people would memorialize him. And it had great views. What chewing gum can buy! But they did save a lot of property which is very cool. Worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
30,Free for Active Duty Military and Family,The admission fees are waived with Military ID. What a nice touch! The views from the memorial are stunning. Worth making a stop when touring the island by golf cart.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290lizk
40,Learn how extensive Wrigley's presence is on this picturesque Southern California Island,"When touring Catalina, you learn that Wrigley had an affinity to this special place. He brought his teams to Catalina. The garden is one stop on a typical tour of Catalina. It has lots of flowers and succulent vegetation to view. The area is easy to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELLOR2013
40,Garden and Memorial,"Uphill walk from town. Little signage so we used a simple island map. A local bus goes here, so we took it for the return. Suggest taking the bus to the memorial if you are doing the garden to sky trail (again poor signage). The walk back to town would be all downhill.The gardens are beautiful, lots of cacti and succulents. Not formal and a bit scruffy but overall a wonderful experience. The memorial is nice too ... somewhat unkempt but lots of amazing local tile work and a beautiful view back to the ocean.Both bus and the gardens are cash and the bus is exact change, so do your research on current prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1949hodad
50,Green and beautiful.,Take the city bus for $2.00! It was green and in bloom because of all the rain. Very walkable. The steps up to the monument were challenging if you have knee problems however.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8129QDjeffl
50,Wonderful hike,"Please visit this memorial garden on foot! From the town it’s only 1.6 miles, slight uphill grade but it’s worth the walk up.On your way you pass a children’s play area, a resistance exercise park, lush golf course, a DELISH breakfast/lunch authentic Mexican restaurant “The Sandtrap”, historic abandoned aviary, Hermit Gulch camp ground with picnic area and the best part - the Nature Center!Nature Center is free, has crafts for the kids and plenty of educational pieces on the local wildlife. Donations are welcomed!The garden itself is beautiful, has several trails throughout the garden with placards telling you the what/where of each plant. Wildlife frequent the area so please keep an eye out and DONT feed them!The garden is also the trailhead to the Garden to Sky hike, offering miles of uphill switchbacks affording gorgeous views of the island/ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csniners
50,Beautiful,Gorgeous views of amazing native plant life. Wish we would have seen a fox but it is well maintained and super informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lunarooney
40,One of the places to hit on a visit,"The highlight is the Wrigley Memorial. It was built shortly after his death and features Catalina materials as well as tiles that were hand painted on the island.There are exhibits of a number of endemic plants so you have an idea of the rarity of some of these species. There are others that have been brought over from some of the other Channel Islands as well as the mainland. In addition there are some that have been brought from as far away as Africa. It is a great opportunity to see the various species that live well in such a climate.This is about a 45 minute walk from Avalon that goes uphill, make sure that you are prepared to walk that distance if you don't have a golf cart. There is a minimal ($8) charge for admittance. Well worth it, but make sure that you know this prior to heading up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobd823
50,Walkable gardens with great views,This botanical garden is well signed and has nice specimens. A few of the trees were downright gorgeous! The memorial at the top was a fairly easy walk up the stairs and well worth the views. The tile work and bronze door were lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svf1991
50,Lovely nature spot,Here is an interesting sample of cactus and other plant life well worth the visit. And some refreshments to purchase really helped. Go earlier in the day as it gets cold in the late afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mannyburgess
50,A Photo OP,The garden is high above the town and thankfully the bus took us there. From the entrance you can see the Memorial and are drawn to it. We saw fox on the way as we passed cactus of all sorts and bougainvillea and trees we never saw before. The Memorial is tiled with lovely designs and the bronze doors and architectural features give many opportunities for shots in the interior. From that spot you can get an expansive view of the hills. The bas relief on the tiles surrounding the tomb of Mr. Wrigley are grand. A fox that hadn't read the don't feed the fox signs waited for a bite and only got his picture taken. Some walked back to town some waited for the bus that came every 40 minutes at Christmastime. Videos of the story of the island and garden are available at the entrance. It was a lovely experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9424IYsuzanneb
30,A Nice Walk,"Because of the recent drought in California, it is obvious the garden hasn't received a lot of water. It has a decent collection of cactus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2rleong
30,A pleasant trip for cactus lovers,A quick $2 bus ride up the hill to see some wonderful plantings of cactus and other desert loving plants. Not crowded but not especially well maintained either. The memorial to Wrigley gives you a better view but a bit over the top tribute-- during the great depression. It's just a huge tower with winding staircases-- a huge waste of money at the end of gilded age-- Hearst would have loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/799kena
50,"Beautiful views, take the bus or taxi","This is a nicely landscaped garden featuring plants native to Catalina. It is a relaxing place to stroll around. There’s a huge monument where you can climb about a hundred feet higher than the surrounding gardens for a beautiful view over the ocean, and a great place for a selfie. The garden is free for active military and their families. It is a long walk uphill, so take the Garibaldi bus for $2, or a taxi. It’s a fun and easy walk back down. Go in the late afternoon and on the way back, stop at the Sand Trap for happy hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickrR9944JL
30,Limited Plant Offerings with Impressive Memorial Tower,"This attraction is located about 1.25 miles from the waterfront in Avalon. It is uphill all the way there so I recommend a ride on the city bus to get there and a walk back down. The gardens are limited to desert plants and arid-climate trees. It was very dry at the time of our visit so flowers were virtually nonexistent. The memorial is a large tower and the view from the terrace is very nice. The walk back to the downtown passed a local high school stadium, golf course, city hall, and local homes.The garden trails are NOT Paved and the memorial has quite a few stairs, so I would not recommend this attraction to wheelchair users or those who have difficulty with uphill climbs. Entrance for we two seniors was $6 each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bverbos
50,Leisurely Vacation Hike,"Great hike for a vacation! First, take a leisurely stroll through the botanical garden, with species from around the world. Then make your way up to the Wrigley Memorial with fantastic views of the island. Then, take the trail and get your heart rate up a bit. The trail spits you back out lower than the garden, back on the main road to town. We walked from our hotel and still made it all the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freschie
50,Peaceful Gardens!,Peaceful Site...Its not huge but we enjoyed the beautiful diversity of trees and plants. We even saw a little fox. We got nice pictures from the Wrigley Memorial structure. We took the public Avalon bus to and from the gardens! Nice Place..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLtravellerjournal
30,"Beautiful Architecture, Meh Gardens","The good: the Wrigley Memorial is a beautiful structure if you're a fan of tile and/or late 20s-early 30s architecture. I'm not sure if its $8-per-person good, but we enjoyed it. The meh: I'm a SoCal native born and bred who LOVES plants and gardens. This one is not very stellar if you love going to the desert and/or native gardens like the ones at the Huntington or Descanso. The POINT of the gardens is great: they're full of endemic plants - it's just that they were mostly dormant. Keep in mind we visited in October - I'm sure the blooms of the spring are quite spectacular. But if you're a native, it's not the spring, and this is your first trip to Avalon, you may find a trip to the interior to be more worth your while. We also hiked up to the ""Garden to the Sky,"" which was a bit of a letdown: you get one sea view from the other side of the mountain...which you could access via other hiking trails. My last on-the-fence note: I do love that your admission goes to the Conservancy! They do great work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanwM9225SM
30,A unique site and pleasant garden,"We walked up from town to this, which I'd do again even though there aren't paths or sidewalks part of the way. The garden is a nice little example of desert / Mediterranean climate specimens, but it's obvious they need more funding to make it as splendid as it could be. The Wrigley memorial is quite its own thing ... a huge investment in something that provides one more unique sight in the area, but leaves you wondering what it is or could be used for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EcoArtTraveler
50,"Sweeping Views, Cacti, & Photo Crazy","On my first visit to Avalon I hiked up here but skipped paying the entry fee and seeing this site. What a mistake! The garden is well-maintained with labels and the Wrigley Memorial has both exquisite tiles from the 1920s and sweeping vistas of the harbor. You can easily do a self-guided tour as the signage is informative but not overwhelming. If you hike, you can buy drinks and snacks at the entry counter and do go early in the day as tours that come in mid-morning ruin the serenity of this memorial for me. The other option is taking the city bus to the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Quite a hike but worth the view,"The gardens, like much of Southern California, were still suffering from drought, but there was a great variety of plants. We. even saw a very small deer. The view at the top of the memorial is fantastic. The tiles, the sandblasted sides, absolutely beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KandyR_12
40,Great Views,"Great Views. The garden is nice and the memorial is a little grandiose IMO, especially when the water feature used to work. There are a couple trails to walk that take you up some of the hills for a great view of the water and Avalon. It's 8 bucks to get in, less for seniors or veterans. It wasn't very busy when we were there, which made it pretty serene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CocosOpinion
50,Worth the journey.,"Cool place, not much $ for seniors. Must see. Is a bit of a hike to the memorial and lots of steps. You can take the public bus from town to admission booth for $2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsotinKid
30,Eh,Memorial a concrete monstrosity with pretty tile work. The cactus gardens are lovely. Lots of variety of plants. Not worth entrance fee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/976marilyna
50,KB,Well marked trails with vegetation labeled. Small but informative nature center. Super friendly staff. Great views from the memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylebistline
50,Cool walk and great views,"Its a must for a visit to the island, bring walking shoes, a camera, and some water for a educational and entertaining jaunt in Catalina's canyons",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1017RImikev
40,Hot and dry but nice hike for a view!,"Visited with my 5 young adult children who like to hike! We took our golf cart to the entrance of the Botanical gardens and between senior and student entrance fees we paid $52 for the 7 of us. I love gardens but this is a desert garden of cacti and succulents. And it is drought dry! There was a free tour but when we came to ask for it the volunteer at the table said she couldn’t leave because she was the only guide there. This was disappointing! We probably would have enjoyed the gardens more!The memorial was cool and the hike to the turnaround was 1.2-1.5 miles and mostly in the sun , so in total miles on a dirt road with a soft incline. Best to do early morning and be prepared with water. Not too strenuous if you are used to walking. We all enjoyed it a lot! And it was t crowded!I would recommend a try for the free garden tour and learn something about the cacti!! I’m sure that would make this so worthwhile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etd79
40,Pretty place,"If you have time to spare, then you may want to explore Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden. Interesting place on Catalina Island. It is a short 30 minute walk from the port in the center of Avalon.Do you like plants? If so, then you should drop by. The entrance fee is low at a cost of $7 for adults. You will see many (if not all) of the plantlife indigenous to the California island. Some are so rare that they are on the Endangered Species list.The centerpiece of the Botanic Garden is the Wrigley Memorial. The monument is impressive. Make sure to also check it out when you visit. It honors the memory of William Wrigley Jr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpoNationals
40,"A great walk, and a great view","We walked all the way here from town (about 2 miles), and were rewarded by an interesting selection of succulents and cacti -- and a glorious view from the Wrigley Memorial. It wasn't at all busy the day we were there, and that made it even nicer -- a great way to escape the hordes of folks in the heart of Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tira63
40,Worth a visit,Took the public bus with the wife and kids. A very cool garden. I enjoyed the cactus garden and the observatory. I would not visit if you are limited in time since I think their are cooler things to see on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SClemens
40,Memorial worth the hike!,"We hiked from the shops - we didn’t know there was a tram available. More advertising of that option would have been nice. The gardens were ok, but the memorial made the trip worth the hike! Would do again, but would take the tram or rent a golf cart to get there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boardofdirectorse
20,Not impressed,This had good reviews so a group of us who were on the island for the day as part of a family reunion decided to check it out. It said it is a “stroll” up to the gardens from the beach. “Hike” is a much more appropriate word. It took us at least an hour to get up there and we were all sweaty and tired by the time we arrived. We paid $8 to get in and there wasn’t much to see. It’s all cacti and succulents. Kind of neat at the lookout at the very top but not worth the long hike or the 8 bucks. It ended up eating up most of our day and left me with a disappointing day overall.Don’t do the botanic gardens unless you have a golf cart or a lot of time to spare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleenb06
50,Beautiful,This was a surprisingly fun afternoon we rode Our golf cart up. It was a beautiful afternoon there was a small entrance fee. The cactus or amazing the walk up to the memorial was very short. Great activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolccCNA
50,Visit To Wrigley Memorial Botanical Garden,"The hot tip is to take the Girabaldi City Bus to the Entrance of the Botanical Garden. From there it is about a 20 minute walk to the Memorial. I wouldn’t want to visit this place during a hot day as there is not much shade and the gardens are all cactus plants. The cactus was blooming when we were there so it made the visit even nicer. You have to pay an admission price, which I thought was a bit pricey, even at the senior rate. If you have trouble walking very far, this is not the place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorrieLarryM
50,Beautiful,"The monument architecture is amazing. The gardens are so beautiful with name tags on most of them so you know what you are seeing. If you are up for a hike, the gardener sky trail is fun. It is reasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelbycobragt1512
40,Lovely gardens (will be more beautiful in summer),"Peaceful, tranquil and well thought out. The grounds are lovely and the plants are well identified. The memorial is a lovely building and the views from the top are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dermgoddess
30,Long walk up,"We walked up about 1.5 miles from shore to check out the memorial and gardens. The views were nice but we expected more from the gardens. Almost all the plants were catus, still beautiful but it would have been nice to see other plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrstats69
30,Not worth the entrance fee,Not a great garden just a ton of cactus that are fab. The mausoleum is bizarre and slightly off putting to haves someone build himself such a huge place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LornaP144
40,Surprisingly interesting,This is sort of a must visit place - the original garden of Mrs. Wriggley. Lots of interesting plant species. Worth the fee to walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OregonRainGuy
50,Completely worth the trip - particularly if you have a golf cart,"The memorial itself is awesome - beautiful with views over the gardens, Avalon, and out to the ocean. That you get to walk through a stunning botanical garden up and back only adds to the pleasure.For a daytripper I'm not sure it would be worth the time it takes to get there without a golf cart. The road along the golf course is suitable for a pleasant stroll...but a bit longer than you might like. But if you have a golf cart...or more than one day on Catalina...you should definitely go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/688leom
40,Botanical Garden,"Very nice, relaxing to stroll though. Learned some of the names for a few suculants. Took some really good pictures. Didn't get to walk up to top, we got there late in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/str82heaven

40,Great Views and Cool Plants,"We knew it was going to be a warm day so this was the first thing on our to do list. Even though it's not a long walk (but it's a steady incline), we decided to take the island bus. ($2 per person) The garden was a bit small, but had a diverse collection of unique desert plants. The memorial was very impressive considering it was made with local island materials. The view was amazing. We did take the bus back to town, but we must have just missed an earlier one. We had to wait 40 minutes. We should have walked back to town since it's all down hill or we even thought about hitch hiking rides down with golf carts that had empty seats. 40 minutes sitting around waiting for a bus was not a good use of our time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salinaf

40,Beautiful Cacti,Accessible by both walking and public transportation. Great photo opportunities. In Summer it is suggested you go earlier as there is little shade. Wearing a hat and taking water is recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
50,I love this kind of thing!,"We walked from Avalon to the garden, I recommend. First, you pass the garden mini-golf, so cute! Next, stop at the Nature Center, learn a bit about what you will see, get a water here, no gift shop at the garden. The garden is California natives, and they bloom between February and June, so if you're here in summer, don't expect a lot of flowers. The biggest feature, and one that's well worth exploring, is the Wrigley Memorial. Beautiful tiles, views, everything about it is beautiful. Daughter and I really enjoyed exploring this memorial and garden. Great morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
40,A Walk in the Park,"This was a our last stop before boarding the Catalina Express back to Long Beach. We had about 3 hours to spare so we put our luggage in lockers at the Express station & hopped on the bus, $2 to go to the garden. The Bus driver, I think his name is Billy, was very personable & gave us lots of information about Avalon as we drove thru it. We went to the Wrigley Memorial first & the view is great. Love all the different Catalina tiles. Afterwards, we walked thru the Botanical garden which was a bit parched. The island is in a drought and they need rain. Water is a precious commodity. It rained the whole day before so we hope that helped. It was also the first of March so gardens usually look a little beat up at that time. There is a place to sit & watch informative videos about the island as well as the wild life. This is a nice inexpensive thing to do with the right shoes & weather. Total time can run 2 to 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lexibelle
30,Pretty Small Garden for $8 a Person,"We viewed the Gardens as part of our hike on the Hermit Gulch Loop. We went up the Hermit Gulch Trail, then came into the Gardens from the back.

50,Beautiful March day!,Lovely day in March and very sparsely populated unlike summertime visits. Fascinating garden variety from around the world and majestic Wrigley memorial high above the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrobertlind
50,Absolutely a must see,"What a gorgeous space to spend relaxing in the afternoon. The architecture is stunning and the tiles were lovely. The grounds were immaculate and the flowers were beautiful. I would say, this monument is a must see on your visit to the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267suzannej
50,Worth a visit,Chose to walk up the hill rather than take public transport. $8.00 to get in. Went early on a Monday morning and had the entire place to ourselves. Several interesting varieties of cactus and other desert plants. Spent a little under an hour there. The Wrigley Memorial looked like it had seen better days but was still interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeInClairemont
40,"History is interesting, too bad its a drought","The gardens are very interesting, but unfortunately, the area is in a terrible drought. They have done a great job keeping up the plants to the best that they can, in spite of that. The memorial is worth the walk. And there are lots of history boards that you can read. Great views from the top and on the ride up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kspeckhard
30,"Great history, needs a little work.","The Wrigley Memorial is a lovely piece of architecture and well worth a visit. While the basic bones and artwork remain to be enjoyed, it was in need of a bit of scrubbing and cleaning - bird lime and just plain ""haven't cleaned in awhile"" dirt and dust. I know, hard to keep on it on an island that can be windy and dusty, but still. The gardens contain a good number of local specimen plants and is, from that aspect, interesting and worthwhile in terms of getting to know Santa Catalina. Still, a little pruning and clean-up was in order - yes I know February is ""off season"" - and some of the plants had broken labels, others were not labeled at all. It;s still a good place for a stroll, especially in late afternoon, or if one is ambitious one can take the sea to sky trail near the Wrigley Memorial for breathtaking island and coastal views. Be warned, it is about 3 miles round trip from the gardens, with maybe 1,500 feet in elevation gain. Still worth it though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsacerdo
50,Beautiful Amazing View!,"Such a peaceful and tranquil place with some amazing views, beautiful sights, flowers and natural fauna. Definitely recommend walking up to the top for the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ltlchristine
50,Worth the climb,"This is definitely a 30 minute uphill trek from the coast, we are so glad we did it. There is an entry fee but it is minimal. While the gardens are not extraordinary, the monument is truly beautiful. You can walk up inside of it and take a look at the stunning Catalina tile everywhere. The view from inside also very nice. There are other hiking trails you can take once you are at that point which provide more beautiful views of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
30,Worth it to see Wrigley memorial,"The severe drought on Catalina Island has taken a toll on the gardens, but the Wrigley memorial is worth the visit and the view is stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bravehearts120
30,"Not Much of a 'Garden', Til You Hike up to the Sky","The Botanical Garden itself isn't much to see- cacti and sand for about a block, leading up to a monument.The real beauty- and the only reason to pay the $8 per person entry fee- is if you take a right past the monument, go past the gates, and onto the Garden to Sky hike. Completely upkept paths, and while it's uphill, it's an easy hike even for those of us that don't usually like going up the side of a hill. What a view! You can see all of Avalon; the boats, the ocean, the stores, everything from Avalon to Bird Park to Wrigley field.Absolutely worth the hike. Bring comfortable shoes, and a good camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davinadawson
50,Well done arid land botanical garden,"We liked the great labeling and diverse collection of fauna that require minimal water. Plus the local had easy access water for the humans there. Had just been raked and tidied up. The memorial was amazing for a small island off the coast of California, just soso and self serving compared to the classic memorials of elsewhere.Easy walk from the harbor: great access to trails exploring more of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artthiel
50,Great hiking,This is a great starting point for hiking. We walked to the memorial at the top of the hill. The hiking path is just to the right of the memorial.Cost: 7 dollars for adults and 3 dollars for students.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenL979
50,Superb day out.,"If you love flora (and fauna) you will love walking from Avalon to the Gardens - about 30 minutes' stroll gentle up-hill along the Canyon. The Memorial is a classic Art Deco structure, and the gardens are superb - native species, some indigent to the Channel Islands. Very worthwhile way to stretch your legs - take 3 hours in all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbrook2016
40,A very nice memorial garden celebrating the flora of desert California.,A 1.7 mile oneway walk from downtown very comfortable in late December. Probably too hot on the summer.Beautiful mature cactus plantings. A nice view back to the harbor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anwillner26
40,A nice diversion,"It took us about 45 minutes to hike here from our hotel near the bay. Upon arriving, we learned that the city’s Garibaldi Bus makes the run up here every 45 minutes, and the cost is only $2 per person per ride. Needless to say, we rode back to town after our visit, but the walk really wasn’t bad getting there. We weren’t expecting it, but they honored our membership from our local botanical garden and gave us free reciprocal tickets for entry. The Wrigley memorial is impressive, but there’s a lot of steps. The right side seemed to have fewer steps. From the top of the memorial, you can see the ocean, but the view wasn’t nearly as good as I had imagined. The location isn’t as high as I thought it might be, and there’s a lot of trees. The botanical garden emphasizes cactus and other desert plants, including boojum trees, barrel cactus, and carob trees. We enjoyed watching the many woodpeckers making their way around and up the palm trees in search of insects. Near the entry, there are well-kept restrooms, and pavilions with exhibits behind glass. There’s also an area where you can choose and watch six short films about the island. We enjoyed the three we saw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmarkwind
30,A good collection of native plants.,It is not a large botanical garden with s lot of exotic plants. It is well maintained and had a lot of information relative to Catalina and the Wrigleys.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9089SFroberth
40,Small and well laid out,Nice enough but nothing spectacular. A good collection of cacti. The memorial at the end is an interesting building. Easy enough to walk to from the town as it's only a shallow incline. A peaceful way to spend an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iaamg
40,Brunch/lunch,"Meal included alcohol. I love old, historic homes. This one has seen its heyday like so many others. But beautiful... no gardens to see due to the drought. Might consider staying here next time since they include breakfast, lunch, golf cart, appetizers and cocktails. Lovely and historic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639499LizW330
40,Interesting and well kept,We here today. Very dry and most plants seemed to be desert style plants. Very well maintained. We went with folks who live on Catalina and are members of the conservatory and we all got in for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimW551
30,A bit sad for lack of water,"We rook the long walk from the beachfront to the park, a good 40mns on foot with a slight upwards incline. We were pooped! Bring water and a sun hat.The gardens are a bit bare, but we are so spoiled on the mainland with botanic gardens. The monument is just that, a monument on a hill. Unless you come from northern climes and you are not familiar with succulents, I would hike to the gates and turn back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KFM214
50,"We drove the golf cart, but you can hike it's about 3 miles, 1.5 hr hike total","You will see beautiful cactus. The memorial is beautiful with an amazing view but it's a hike, so you need good shoes and water. They did sell small snacks and drinks if the ticket booth is open. If it's not open you can get to the memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julsgarden

40,Great excursion! The hike to the top provides stunning views of the valley.,This hike provides stunning views of the valley. The succulents are beautiful. Nice excursion off the main drag of Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creneeo
40,Simple trip to outside of Avalon,Short bus ride on the electric powered bus for $2 per person. Easy walking paths with lots of tree and plants. Just walk around and be amazed at the variety.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_Victorville_CA
20,Disappointing; poorly maintained,"For $7 you will see dried up desert shrubs and trees. There doesn't seem to be much pruning of the plants. The memorial is okay but mostly a giant concrete blob with accents of marble and Catalina tile. You will get a view of the ocean--woo woo--but many locations in Avalon have better views. There is a small nature exhibit near the entrance to the gardens. If you want to walk, just go there and turn around. I hate to say it but the gardens sucked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712robinp
40,History and botany in one location,"The Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden is a peaceful educational sanctuary in a mostly desert like place. At the time of year we were there, in October, there were very few blooming plants, but a variety of labelled native and non-native plants, trees and cacti. The Wrigley Memorial is impressive and provides a beautiful view of the surrounding area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarleneR437
50,A very long bus ride to go see the small airport.,My husband wanted to see the airport where he and his father used to fly into. Not much to do there but we made new friends on the bus ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/razzwho1
30,Pretty part of the island,The Wrigley Botanic Garden is a lovely part of the island and should be visited to learn about native and non-native flora and fauna. It is part of learning about the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Very informative video clips and impressive garden.,"We enjoyed the different varieties of cacti, palms, trees from the Americas and Africa. From the Wrigley Memorial, you can have a good view of Avalon on a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariejo8814
40,Enjoyed the visit and history.,"We like to take a morning walk and this was a good destination. A 4 mile walk round trip from Hotel Metropole. In Sept not much was blooming, but history is interesting and beauty of the memorial was worth visiting. Small entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luciearl
40,Do the Garden-To-Sky hike from here if you have time!,"Came to the island on my birthday on the Catalina Express, and maximized my usage of the Birthday perks! The 7 dollar admission is free if you have your ""birthday button"" on you to prove it. To get here you can either walk up Avalon Canyon Road from town, or take the shuttle bus ($2 one way, cash only, need exact amount, no change available) either from the boat terminal or at the bus stop at Catalina Ave near the Island Tour Plaza (there is a bench along the road where you can sit and wait).Sure enough the view from the memorial is nice, but even better at the summit of the Garden-To-Sky Trail.So if you are doing the hike, I would wait for the bus which should come every 20 mts or so, because walking uphill will take you at least 30 minutes and will also wear you out. Once you are at the garden, keep walking towards the memorial, and you will see the gate to your right to start your hike. The dirt road will take you to the top, from there you should be able to see the other side of Catalina on a clear day. To the ""Garden to Sky Summit sign"" it is 1.2 miles, and should take around 40 minutes.From there, we decided to take a left along the East End Road for awhile so we can see more of the other side of the island, and came back. I thought it was well worth it.As for the garden itself, if you live quite close to here or in the desert, it might not be as appealing to you, however if you are not from the area, the native plants may interest you.Tips:1) Don't do this hike if you only have flip-flops. Yes, the hike is on a wide dirt road, so it may seem less strenuous, however going back downhill can make you slip. In fact, my husband had his running shoes on, was doing fine going up, but downhill he was slipping several times!2) Recommend you to stop by the Catalina Conservancy House on Clarissa Ave. before you go. You are supposed to register yourself before you take any hikes and the information you provide is used for emergency purposes only. You can also register online, but the conservancy house can provide you with valuable information. Also with the ""birthday button"" you may be able to receive a gift or discounts if you decide to take some tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
30,Unexpected,"We walked from the waters edge to the memorial before doing the loop hike. The memorial is a nice tribute to Wrigley but we thought since it was called a botanical garden that it would be a little more diverse of plants and the garden a little larger. There is a water shortage on the island so the plants are more water tolerant. But they did a nice job with labeling the plants they have. If no one goes to see it then it won't be supported, so if you're looking for something different to do with kids or just a leisurely stroll, this would be a decent alternative. FYI: There are stairs to get to the memorial itself. Going up the left side is easier for pets and small children, as the right side is all stairs. Beautiful views from the top. And if you go on your birthday, you get in free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63
40,Nice botanic garden and interesting memorial,We took the city bus to get there - it makes a big loop around the town of Avalon so serves as an unguided tour. :-) The botanic garden and memorial were nice - and hot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/600jamess600

50,Will not appeal to those who need a manicured suburban lawn,"Departing the heart of the village of Avalon on the city bus ($2 each way) you traverse up the canyon seeing parts of Avalon missed by most tourists to the gate of the garden in the canyon far above. Your visit continues beyond the entrance building and upslope toward the memorial edifice constructed of locally sourced materials, aggregate for the cement, marble, etc. It is no longer a tomb, but the memorial is a significant archtectural monument designed by Chicago archtects and amplifies the view down the canyon, (no flowers per se, no golf course lawns--it's a desert DUH!!) back toward Avalon. If you are interested in indigenous Santa Catalina Island flora, you must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roamingbears
30,no flowers?,"We went mid September and there were no flowers, plenty of cactus. The memorial was cool to see, no one is buried there but a neat architectural structure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinfan3

40,Amazing plants from all around the world,"Like a lot on Catalina the Gardens have seen a lot of work since my last visit. Visitor center, tours and upgraded grounds show where the $7 per adult admission fee has gone. Students with IDs, $3, Seniors $5. You can walk up to the garden past the golf course and Bird Park or take a shuttle. Nice experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcslatts

40,Lots and lots of steps but worth it,"We walked up from the beach (and back down) and we hit 12,500 steps before lunchtime. The garden is nice with a huge variety of plants and a naturalist gave us an informal tour. The Wrigley Memorial is above. It's a gorgeous structure with amazing views of the ocean from high above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandiR81

40,The walk from town to the Botanical Garden is worth it!,"I have walked from town up to the Wrigley Botanical Gardens and Memorial several times, and am always struck by how beautiful the view from the top of the memorial is. The Botanical Gardens themselves are interesting and make you realize that Catalina Island isn't lush and jungle-like (many people think it is). It is actually very dry and home to many native cactus like plants and succulents. This is a great place to be introduced to many of those. They also have members of the Catalina Conservancy available to answer all of your questions (at least they were able to answer all of mine) about the native animals and plants on the island.When you walk up the stairs to the Memorial, stop and take a look back every few steps. Not only are the views beautiful, but you can see how far you've walked (at least that is what my teenagers noticed). I love that there are signs talking about the history of Catalina tile, and that helps you appreciate the beauty even more. It's a perfect photo opportunity and a beautiful sight to see.If you have students with you (kids are under 12, otherwise they count as an adult admission price), make sure they have a student id. They can then get in for the student price. We didn't know that and paid full price ($7) for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokkahulababy
40,Forget the Gardens; Climb up to the Monument,"I thought these ""botanical gardens"" would be plush with bougainvilleas and other California flora and fauna. These gardens are desert! On the trail, we saw only a few flowering bushes or trees. I was disappointed until we headed uphill to the Wrigley monument. The views atop the hill are breathtaking. Uniquely, blue granite is inlaid to the steps. The views look over the canopy of Avalon trees and into the blue Pacific ocean. If you're going so that you can see beautiful flowers, skip this tour. If you can make it up the incline and steps to get a fabulous view, this is a great tour to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubajackie
40,Nice for an hour or so,"A wide variety of island-climate plants, although many are from Madagascar and the Canary Islands. I noted a few labels for the Catalina native plants, but many species I saw on an island heights bike ride were absent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112thomask
40,Nice place for a walk,The Botanical Gardens were a nice get away from the tourists in town. An easy walk once you enter the grounds with just a slightly elevated trail from start to finish. Beautiful views of the mountains and the ocean once you reach the top. Plants are identified with posted information. I would recommend purchasing a bottle of water before you begin the walk...it can get warm during summer days. Take a golf cart to the entrance and park it outside the main gates. We used this as part of our golf cart rental time...time well spent. Wear comfortable walking shoes if possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351MarkB351
50,Good hike to the top,"The morning was overcast and chilly so we took a hike starting at the base of the memorial. It was approx. 1.5 miles up a winding road on the side of the mountain, with good views of both sides of the island at the top. The hike was somewhat strenuous at times, but doable even for those of us that don't regularly exercise. Afterward we walked around the memorial. Great way to spend a morning on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotNKsAnymore

50,Skip the paid tours with a do-it-yourself tour,"For island visitors who are on a day trip with limited time, take the Avalon Transit ($1.00 per ride irregardless of age) from the harbour area to get a ride around town. There are two buses that run every 20 to 30 minutes from the docks to the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens. There is an admission fee to visit the place. The bus winds through the downtown area of Avalon and passes by the museum before heading up to the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Garden. From the elevation of the Memorial, there is a great view of Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arrastape
40,Nice side trip,"So, first off you must go to Catalina Island. You must. It is incredible. While there you should rent a golf cart at one of the many places and take a tour of the island. This is on the tour. California is of course in a drought so if you are looking for a botanical garden with lush flowers and plants, you are in the wrong state. This was a nice selection of succulents and trees which was lovely. The cool thing though is the big monument/structure at the end. It was built by Wrigley (I think....) and there are many cool plaques describing the process. Also, at the top is a great view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovefancyhotels
30,Nice visit to waste some time,Neat little side attraction. Not much to do except look at some plants and trees. Mostly the same ones over and over. At the top is a neat tower you can climb and learn a little history. Definitely nice to take pictures at. We enjoyed ourselves. And for $7 each it was worth the experience. We rode bikes to the top which was great exercise. A total memorable experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithrN8779PG
30,"Worthwhile stop while on the golf cart tour, but expensive","We stopped here while taking the golf cart tour around the island. The facilities are nice, and the plants are beautiful. My only complaint is that its really quite expensive for what you get, however they probably don't get many guests and everything on the island is expensive. I wouldn't go back, but I""m glad we popped in for 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1541BHbrianc

50,Worth the viait,"We opted for the 30-45 min walk slightly uphill walk which was fine since the weather was cool and breezy but it would be less pleasant in July heat. The gardens are on the golf cart scenic tour route so if u rent a golf cart, which we did, u could visit the gardens as a stop.

40,Simple desert garden with cactus,"It's nice to visit a place where you can see and learn about local flora. This is well kept and there is an informational area that explains about the local flora.

The hike to the top is about 10 min. Would suggest going all the way to the top level of the memorial. The view is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happiegyrl
50,Great day,It was a great walk up to the gardens. There is a local bus that drives by every 20 minutes which you can take for about a dollar. Then you can go to the gardens and walk around leisurely at your own pace. It's actually quite lovely. The top part with the building structure has stairs. It was a decent walk well worth the amazing view of the ocean once you get to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladc2001
40,"Small but interesting, clean and a beautiful view","You can take the public transit to the garden for about a dollar which is about 2 miles if you walk, mostly up hill. The garden is small but clean, plants well marked and well maintained with a good variety. The memorial at the top is nice with a super view however is not wheelchair excesible. We even got close to a wild fox that hangs around there which you are not to feed. This is a nice change from the busy town where it is peaceful with nice fresh air. Well worth the 7$ or 5$ for seniors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltadennisk
50,Amazing view,"The ""hike"" up to the memorial is well worth the journey. The memorial resides inside the botanical garden run by the parks service. The memorial is beautifully kept, and is a great nearly free activity to do while on the island. The view is only bested by the ""Garden to Sky"" hiking trail. The trail is a little long, as it switches back and forth up the mountain. Once at the top of the trail, you'll able to see almost the entire island, and the very shore of Long Beach on a clear day. Highly recommend, don't miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767nickt92
50,Nice Memorial,"This is a nice botanical garden, featuring the local island plant life along with a good deal of other plant material Remember that most of this island is arid, so the plans are decidedly desert-like. The garden is at the top of Avalon Canyon Road, and when you are in downtown Avalon, everything is uphill from there. It is about 1.5 miles...uphill. But worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbF6009PF

40,Worth the uphill hike!,"Beautiful views from the memorial. The garden is not your typical garden so don't expect orderly lawns or lots of flowers, it's mostly local plant life. The views were magnificent and there are some great hiking trails from this area, although we did not venture out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suenose
40,Beautiful way to spend an afternoon,"The gardens are lovely, but I'd definitely go to the Museum first to get a good idea of the history behind it. The only bummer about the gardens is that there aren't any ""guided"" options, such as an app or audio assistant to help you learn a bit more about what you're seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daliesik
40,Beautiful,The botanic garden plants were unbelievable!!! Perfectly labeled. The trek to the Memorial was slightly uphill with several steps needed to get to the top of the memorial. Wonderful place to visit to get another view of the beauty of Catalina!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9876GJdans
50,Nice hike!,"If you are not in good shape TAKE THE $1 BUS! You can do the park in the 40 minutes wen the next bus comes if you keep moving. No snack bar unless you count bags of M and Ms. A frequent visitor advised taking the trail less traveled--veer a bit off the straight up path to the LEFT. Great choice, has nice detour across a couple of wooden bridges and more tree cover than the main path--a plus is it is a bit more gradual climb. The trees were literally humming with the thousands of bees The park is lovely and videos very well done. Larger signs and a little more ambience would enhance the experience. At the top of the hill is the Wrigley Memorial (the Mausoleum with no one buried there----goes with the bird park with no birds; post office that does not deliver; casino with no gambling--it is a thing.) The view from the no-dead-guy-there monument is beautiful and worth the walk. Drought put an end to the gorgeous fountain but the solitude and quiet is very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lektra8462
40,Wrigley Botanical Garden,"Slightly run down but quiet, beautiful plants and trails! Price wasn't horrible but slightly overpriced at $7/adult. Loved the hike and plants tho! Glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelaW6798MV
50,Great for military,This is free for military and a must go! Lots of plants and an interesting story for the monument. You can jog here or walk from anywhere in Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navydoc2024
50,Tour the Island,"Take one of the expedition tour to learn the rich history of the island, you won't be disappointed (if you like history).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryandLisa0916
30,Enjoyable self guided tour with spectacular views,"They have a couple different gardens to walk through with native plants and cacti to look at, some of which are very interesting looking. At the end of the garden is a memorial to William Wrigley Jr. of the chewing gum fame. If you climb to the top of the memorial you get a spectacular view of Avalon bay. If you like to hike and are feeling adventurous, there is a trail to the right of the memorial called the garden to sky trail. It's a 1.2 mile hike that takes you to the summit of the mountain where you can get a beautiful 360 view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarl101
50,"Beautiful, serene place","Beautiful place. Amazing plants. Beautiful sights. We had an awesome guide, who knew a lot of history. Great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylkuci
50,Really cool,Was a bit of a hike but it was sure fun! Had a great view and it was quite a site to see . It is well worth the time to see it .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryjfm
50,Pleasure,"Very interesting place. Informative to learn some of the plants and wildlife are unique to the island. Spoke with the docent of Catalina Island Conservancy who provided further information about plants, animals, etc. We would recommend this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobhQ2251RH
30,Great cactus...,"It's a low-key place with small signs on plants. Not much interaction with staff. Interesting native plant species. We were very lucky to actually see one of the endangered foxes. Rode the bus for $1.00 up to the gardens from town and walked back, stopping at the Nature Conservancy along the way (thus learning about the small foxes). Over priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sondra27
40,Wrigley Memorial is unbelievable!,"If someone just told me that the guy who sold Wrigley's chewing gum has a mausoleum like this one, I might have laughed and said who cares. Once you know the history and the care this man had for the island and the people there, you begin to understand the memorial Botanical garden. It's a one of a kind and well worth the short easy hike up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288rogerr
40,This was pretty cool,We had fun walking around and taking pics here. It was very pretty and well kept grounds. If you are thinking of going go see it for sure. The bathrooms were very clean which is always a plus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198mistyb
50,The cactus garden to beat all cactus gardens!,"Mrs Wrigley, a big thanks for creating this beautiful testament to the beauty that desert plants provide us!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikegbrennan
50,Wonderful cactus; nice to see the memorial; a feast for the eyes.,This is a nice walking trip through the botanical garden up tot he memorial. The cactus are especially intereesting. The memorial is quite a masterpiece. Well worth seeing and appreciating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtiktinsky
30,Just ok,We thought the memorial and mansion were in the same place. My understanding is the mansion cannot be visited by general public.We've been to Catalina many times. So this time we decided to do more walking and less tours. It was a nice walk. The gardens was mostly succulents and cactus. Little variety. The biggest attraction to us was a little fox that was injured and was hanging around the memorial. He was very cute and seemed mostly used to people.Nice views from the memorial.There is an entrance fee which I did not think was worth the price until I found out Birthdays were free and so only had to pay for my wife. $7.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4253QTcarlosr
50,"Nice Hike, good views","This is a really nice hike if you walk in from Avalon. The views from the memorial are stunning. The plants are local/native plants to California, which was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etshp
40,A great place to unwind and walk about,"This is a very nice and secluded botanical garden with interesting native plants. While not very paved, it is a smooth walk without needing to go up and down many, if any hills. To get here you will need to bike or drive as it is a ways from the town. Bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
30,Nice if you're a botanist,"It would be difficult to give anything on Catalina island a poor review. Everything is so beautiful and peaceful. If you are looking for a place to enjoy nature then I would recommend the memorial. However, it's not much different from any other nature spot on the island. If you are interested in plants that are native to the area then you're in luck. However, if a plant is just a plant to you then I would just hike around anywhere on the island. I go to the memorial every time I am on the island but it's mostly for the sake of tradition. Beautiful place but would be hard to fully appreciate if you're not into plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skylarlisa6899
40,Nice place,"Nice place to visit, we took bikes to go there, it was steep but not very hard. As long as we reached the destination we saw the family of deers, they let us pet them. Garden was ok, but the trail that leads you up in the sky was great, nice views, peaceful atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/504kaseye
30,Visited here when visited for Jazz Festival,"Get ready to walk and hike. I gave it an Average rating for what it was not what it is. It was the resting place for Mr Wrigley, but he was moved to Chicago I believe. I am not a big hiker and certainly not a botanist, so this was not as exciting for me. I am assuming if you are a hiker, it would be an average hike. If you are a botanist hiker, I assume this will be thrilling for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthmore
50,Edge of wild Catalina above the town of Avalon,"Terrific cactus and native plants garden with tropical plants from all over the Hemisphere as well. Wrigley Memorial an Art Deco lumbering giant, but walk up the mountain from it reveals a fine view of the whole half-circle harbor of Avalon--and we had a great sighting of the endemic Catalina red fox, found only here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithD254
40,A Tranquil Setting,"For those horticulturists and anyone who enjoys plants this is a must see. You can take a 10-minute bus ride from Avalon to the entrance. You can wander up the hill through the gardens at your own pace. Eventually, you reach the Wrigley memorial in all of its Art Deco style. The tiles are actual Catalina Tile that were made nearby. Climb the stairs to the top of the memorial for a nice view of Avalon.Those wanting a little more exercise can take a short, leisurely walk downhill back to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayA427
50,"Lovely Wrigley memorial, high above the town","We walked from town (up, up, up), and enjoyed the gardens, memorial, and views. In the gardens, we saw mostly cactus and succulents, and a few were blooming. The memorial is accessed through beautiful bronze doors. Magnificent tile work on the steps and memorial. Perhaps the most beautiful is blue flagstone, which was quarried on Catalina Island. The memorial and gardens are maintained by the Catalina Island Conservancy. If you don't want to walk all the way, a city bus will take you to the Conservance entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAwalkers
50,A beautiful garden of many species.,"For those who love succulents and native species this is the place. A beautiful setting in a canyon headed by a magnificent structure. It is a nice uphill walk from town, but look at it this way--it's downhill on the way back. The taxi ride up is nice too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earlya
40,Nice place to visit!,A lot about the history of Catalina. Interesting and cool memorial. We actually happened to pass through it to take the Garden to Sky hike. $7/person to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLKinHB
50,We walked from town,Such a delight. Really easy walk. Great to be out in the fresh air and walking off all our drinks and meals. Very informative garden. Well identified and amazing view from the memorial. Highly recommend this excursion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itsmenow2012
50,Insights into island plants,Very cool insights into plants on the island. Looking at all the plants and trees differently now I know what they are!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneB24
30,Interesting Video on Catalina wildlife/plants,"Wrigley Memorial Botanical gardens is 1.5 miles up from downtown Avalon at the end of the road. You can walk or take the city bus for $1. Gardens are primarily varieties of Cacti. Some unique species. Not a large garden. The short videos that you can watch at the entrance are worthwhile, 6-10 minutes each. Memorial to William Wrigley at the top of the hill, with some extensive Catalina tile work. Wrigley was originally buried here, but his body has since been moved to Pasadena, CA. $7 entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetmreynolds
30,Wrigley Memorial - Avalon Catalina Island,Not too much here to see. We did see a family of deer grazing though. Need to rent a golf cart or take one of the many busses to see.. long way from the port/harbor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherW999
50,Sweet view,The botanical gardens were beautiful. It was a nice walk to the memorial. Stopping along the way to look at the various plants was very nice. There's some trees there that are very unique in fact most of the plants are unique for this area. It was great to learn about the history and to watch the videos about the history. A good site to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladc2001
40,Very Enjoyable!,"We rented bikes and rode them to the Garden. Even tho there was a bit of an incline, it was a fairly easy ride. Really enjoyed walking around and seeing all the desert plants. Each so unique and different, yet beautiful in their own way. We even saw a couple of foxes!! The views at the top of the magnificent memorial were amazing. Next time I think we will take some refreshments and just sit up there for awhile enjoying the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinda10
50,Pretty and quiet,"We took the city bus for $1 but it's only about 1.5 miles from the boardwalk, the bus ride gives you a little scenic history if you have a good bus driver like we did. It's very peaceful, and the gardens are nice to stroll through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrearH6743OB
50,"Oh, the views!",Never miss walking up to the gardens when visiting Catalina. They have done such a great job with the nature path. And those views!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytravels921
50,Worth the Walk,We walked up from downtown and it is worth the gentle climb. One can take the bus ($1) but miss a lot along the way. Seniors admit for $5 each and worth the price. Great cactus garden to view and the memorial is informative. In fact a couple got engaged at the memorial during out visit. Very sweet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Topspinut
50,Beautiful Start of Visit to Catalina Island,"Interesting botanical garden. Favorite visiting spot of a rarely spotted Catalina Island Fox. Great view from the Memorial. Quite an exercise to walk from town to site (there are buses, rental carts).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823CindyK
40,Definitely Returning,"Visited in early October. I enjoyed our family visit to the memorial and garden. I believe that our grandson enjoyed it more than we did though we had a fantastic time. Beautiful view from the memorial and Sky Hike. Definitely recommend it. Travel with camera, comfortable walking shoes, and water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545sandras
50,Birthday Tour,I went to Catalina for my Birthday and had a great time. I rented a bike and road up to the Wrigley Memorial. My admission to the gardens and memorial was free due to my Bday. It looks pretty nondiscript from the outside but it has a great view and amazing architectural details...Love the Catalina tile. The walk up is not bad but might be much for the elderly. If you take your time and meander through the gardens it has shade and wonder plants. The island is experiencing a drought so I notice a lot of replanting in progress. The trail to the summit looked closed so I didn't venture up there. I would have if I knew it was open??? Don't be fooled like me I should of investigated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaSnorkelQueen
50,worth a trip,"It is mainly a cactus garden. However, the garden isn't the main attraction to me. It is the hiking that starts here. Getting to the top of mountains for the views is breathtakingly beautiful! It is a difficult climb so take that into consideration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/careks
50,nice stroll,"beautiful natural cactus garden. I am not a fan of cactus, but I enjoyed the beauty & the many species of all the plants. They are well tagged , I learned a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanj471
50,"Toured garden and memorial, the hiked",Toured the awesome gardens and memorial. Then took an awesome hike 'Gardens to Sky'. The hike was awesome and great views at the top of the mountain. A must do and see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlackRoseCher
40,for plant and history enthusiasts,I really enjoyed the botanical garden and the memorial. I walked from Avalon (~1/2 mile) and enjoyed the walk. I planned hiking beyond the memorial to the 'Garden to Sky' summit so I was prepared for a hike. The botanical garden is filled with fantastic succulents and drought resistant plants. Being from SoCal I am always interested in drought resistant plants. The gardens are informative and there are pathways that wind through the plant areas. The Wrigley Memorial is located just up the hill from the gardens and it is a great spot to get a nice view of the ocean just beyond Avalon. The tile work and architecture of the memorial was beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalAdventureSeeker
50,Great Views Of Catalina and Nice Gardens.,They have really improved the gardens since I was last there several years ago. They do need rain as does all of California.Wonderful views from the top of the Memorial.We walked from the town and then took the Bus shuttle (for $1.oo a person back to town (it is air conditioned!!).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931ck
30,Nice gardens/historic site,Take trolley for a dollar to museum/botanical garden. Trolley runs every 30/35 minutes; can probably see the entire site in that time. $7 entrance fee but hotels usually have a fun card for free admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertmD2019ER
40,"Beautiful, but drought is bad","The Botanic Garden and Wrigley Memorial are beautiful. The Memorial is simple yet powerful. The Garden has many plants indigenous to Catalina Island. The Garden to Sky Hike, which begins next to the Memorial, is a great hike! The footing is easy because it follows a fire road, but it's steep. The reward is the fabulous view from the top! You are on the ridge of the island and can see down to Avalon in the east and the western side of the island which is wilderness. Gorgeous fog climbing over the ridge the morning we hiked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sasa323
20,"Not much to see, not worth the money.","The only reason you should go to this place is if you really love cactuses or have nothing else to do. It is also way too expensive for what you can see there.I don't know about other visitors but when we were there, all of the plants were dead(dried up) and there's nothing interesting about Wrigley's memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markusu886
50,Must See When Visiting Catalina,"I would highly recommend renting a golf cart in the morning and its a nice scenic drive up to the Wrigley's Memorial & Botanical Garden. I arrive when it opened and it was perfect time to go because I was able to walk through, and appreciate the view, and the garden and property itself. It truly is a must see if you are on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caliatl83
30,Interesting,"It was very hot the day we were there and it's an uphill climb in desert landscape, so didn't enjoy it as much as we would've if the weather had been cooler.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janh430
40,Visited a long time ago but was very cool,"Went there on a cruise many years ago but it was overall a really cool experience, first botanical garden I ever went to and the views/exotic plants were incredible. If your kids are adventurous then by all means take them here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaine96
40,Fascinating,Sadly the drought has taken its toll. Despite this the garden is well kept & full of interesting plants. The memorial is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetcH2910UU

50,Amazing Botanical Garden...and just stunning Memorial to Wrigley! A must see 'thing to do' in Avalon.,This is a must see attraction. Great history and shows to watch on Catalina then a wonderful walk through the botanical garden Wrigley himself planted so many yrs ago. After a nice walk through the gardens u end up at the Wrigley Memorial built in the early 30's with stunning architecture and Tile work from his pottery company on the island. Once you reach the top there is a stunning view down through the valley to the Pacific Ocean. Just gorgeous!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BGoddard
50,A Long Walk To Actual Memorial,"It might have been the time of year we visited the Botanical Gardens, but nothing was blooming and mostly cactus. It was a long walk to the actual memorial, with no help for the elderly or handicapped. Once you are in the memorial, view was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fisherman484
40,Interesting gardens,Gardens were interesting even with the severe drought in Catalina now. The memorial was impressive with an interesting history. Short walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrscfkeane

40,Interesting,Enjoy island horticulture. I was amazed how many species thrive on Catalina. This is interesting and worth my visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
50,Plants for an arid enviroment,"We enjoyed the growth on the shaded south side of dry creek. Memorial is worth the hike up the steps. Again go up the dirt south path to the shallow steps up the back side of Memorial. No elevator and not possible for non ambulant people. Is a difficult hike. Not easy stroll up hill, but beautiful if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virgangulo
40,Art Decor Memorial and Native Plants,There is a city bus that will take you up here for $1 each way. The Wrigley Memorial is beautiful and worth the hike up. Gorgeous art deco tiles. Beautiful view too. Good for photos. The garden is great (I am a horticulturalist) and features plants that only grow on Catalina Island. Wish they had a gift shop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smccmcd
50,Mr. William Wrigley Jr. Would be Proud,"Impressive memorial built by the wishes of Ada Wrigley. Constructed almost exclusively with material found on Catalina Island. The memorial is a beautiful reminder of the man that went from a dream to reality of riches. He shared his success with those around him as he promoted hard work and strength of mind.The gardens surrounding the memorial are well landed out and labeled.Well worth the small few of 7$ to enter. The money goes back into the maintenance of the property.Behind the memorial there is a trail called Garden to Sky, an easy 1.2 mile path. At the end of this path you reach an amazing over look of the gardens and all of Avalon. Good for small children as well as adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluewaterGypsy
50,Interesting plants & lovely view,"The plants are struggling in this drought, but it was interesting to see what Mrs. Wrigley planted in her ""cactus"" garden. The walk up to the memorail is nice with a nice view from the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385gretchens
50,Amazing! Do not pass up!,"The mausoleum is gorgeous! Hike up past the mausoleum for some amazing views top three mountains and trails. By far, the best last of Catalina is this area. Hourly recommended. Bring water or a camelbak because it's a 2.4ish mile walk to the summit. Would definately recommend. Awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RwATLLA
30,"NICE , BETTER IF YOU ARE REALLY INTO PLANTS","It was something to do when there was really NOTHING to do on the island. Easily accessible with golf cart rentals. We are not big on flowers or plants , it was just something to do when nothing else to do on the island",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josL7740YS
20,Moderate but not tremendous,The gardens are interesting but not our most outstanding visit on Avalon. It seems somewhat lacking grooming to me. I'm sure Mrs Wrigley kept it much nicer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCW22
40,Majestic (but shadeless) memorial,"I knew I had to visit the Memorial after being impressed by its design in photos I saw. It's a fitting and majestic tribute to the man, William Wrigley Jr., whose vision and wealth forever transformed Catalina into a tourist mecca back in the 1920's.The Memorial is located at the end of Avalon Canyon Rd. beyond the high school and golf course. I had a golf cart, otherwise it's a bit of a walk. The trolley stops here also. The memorial was built in 1933-34, largely from materials sourced from the island. The many tiles were made by the Catalina Pottery Plant that Mr. Wrigley founded. Mr. Wrigley was interred for a short time here. His widow Ada had the garden planted in 1935. The garden now places an emphasis on California Island endemic plants--plants found only on one of the California islands, but nowhere else. There are 6 such plants on Catalina. The Memorial and Garden are now under the auspices of the Catalina Island Conservancy.There is a $7 adult admission charge, so this would be a somewhat pricey excursion for a family. Although educational, I think some kids would find it dull. Plus there's more walking, slightly uphill, through the gardens (with very little shade) to ultimately reach the memorial. Apparently people sometimes see deer and cute Catalina foxes onsite, but I saw none.The gardens had a lot of interesting cacti and succulents, but the main attraction was the memorial. Very regal and minimalist. Having taken the Silver Canyon Pottery tour that morning, I was able to better appreciate the many tiles used here. The view from the memorial out to the ocean is nice, as is the view of the memorial from the entrance. At the base of the memorial is a trail head for the Garden to Sky trail, a popular hike (you have to pay the entrance fee to start the hike here).Overall a pleasant hour diversion. Bring water, sunglasses and a hat or umbrella.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pillowsofwanderlust
50,Interesting History,"My wife and I took a golf cart up here and went for a walk. It's $7 for adults, $5 if you're a veteran and have some ID to prove it. Pretty affordable.Here was a tent with some skulls and pictures of the local fix that is native to the island. The person sitting there was knowledgeable about the area and friendly.There are signs along the way describing plants and trees. The large arch you see is pretty nice as well and has information about the history of its build, as well as the man that built it.It was worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StopItRick
50,"Beautiful Gardens, Lovely Hike",We walked from Avalon up to the memorial and saw several deer along the way. The gardens and the memorial and very nice and the view is spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betsy_s39
40,Beautiful and Education Hike,"Well worth the price of park entry, there are endemics and succulents galore and the walk up to the Wrigley Memorial (what was supposed to be a family mausoleum) is a great way to burn some calories on Catalina. The memorial building itself includes gorgeous architecture and excellent examples of the tiles and mosaic work that helped make Catalina famous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
40,Interesting endemic plants,"This place is pretty cool if you are into plants. They have many indigenous plants & trees only found on the Channel Islands. Trees & plants are marked with plaques identifying the names and place of origin. When you get to the end of the road you can climb up the Wrigley Memorial. The views from the top are stunning you can see the ocean. We even saw a fox just walking around calmly not phased by the people at all. Make sure you visit early because there is not much shade and it can get hot walking thought the gardens, Also bring water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seahunters2000
50,I always visit the Botanical Garden when in Catalina,"I love walking through here, some interesting specimans. This time I was aware of several plants from Madagascar, don't know how I would have missed these in the past. Interesting cacti, some endemic plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keywestelaine
50,"Another ""Do Not ""Miss When on Catalina""","Sadly too many folks miss out on this gem because it's a long walk. Rent a bike or golf cart. DO IT. Amazing large gardens with incredible variety and beauty, well-marked. I am no botanical kind-of-guy (I prefer the UFC) but this is a wonderful, peaceful place. They walk up to the the big memorial is so worth it with the amazing views of the island. Rarely anyone there... I've had it all to myself a few times.You will be very glad you visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229jodye
30,Walking uphill and lots of stairs,"It is very very dry, therefore botanical garden is trying to survive. We took the transit bus, it was cheap and comes every 20 mins. We walked to the memorial monument but had no idea there was lots of stairs and uphill. However we did see a friendly fox which was fun. Take time at the beginning to watch the videos, they are interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spiritfuleyes
30,Wrigley Legacy,"Not what it was in the day when they had water on the Island. But the Bird exhibit, on the same road 5 minutes away, and garden is worth a quick walk through. Some unusual plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snorris57
40,Nice little hike great view from memorial.,It was a nice cloudy cool day so the hike up to the memorial was enjoyable. There is a huge staircase to the right but a smaller and easier one to climb hidden on the left. Definitely worth the trip up to the top of the memorial to get a snapshot of the view. The gardens were filled with cactus we spotted a catalina fox several times. We took the bus from downtown to the gardens for $1.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enlightexplore
30,A great half day family activity,"Avalon is not big and golf carts are the tourist mode of transport, so going to the gardens is the end-of the-road for the golf carts. Go west of town past the golf course, park at the gatehouse and for a very low admission ($9 adults/ $7 seniors) you can wander around a very well signed arid plant collection. As a bonus we even saw the Catalina fox.Wander to the west of the garden up an arroyo path and you'll find the massive Wrigley Memorial: formerly a mausoleum. Continue on the Garden to Summit trail (~45 minutes) for a splendid view of both sides of the island at 1500 feet ASL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelh409
50,Wonderful view and gardens!,The Wrigley Memorial & Botanic Garden is a great way to experience nature on Catalina Island. It is high in the hills overlooking Avalon and the Harbor. It is great to take an Electric Car to the Garden. Wonderful way to get some exercise as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindalcox
30,Wrigley empire,"The Wrigley's deep pockets and good taste are better represented in their Catalina homes and casino (or their building in my long ago hometown of Chicago). This was a fairly disappointing excursion leaving me asking ""was that IT?"" Even the climb to memorial didn't reward the visitor with much of a view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonin546
40,Golf Cart,Fun destination with the golf cart! Road winds way up and around the town of Avalon and a great picture taking opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RUFun
50,A wonderful surprise,This is a conservancy garden that is about a one mile walk up from the town. Once you get there it is just about as interesting a botanical garden as we have ever seen (we've seen a lot!). They have every plant identified and some history and notes about the more interesting ones. The garden is capped by a building dedicated to Wrigley who determined that Catalina needed to be a protected land and not over developed. The gardens can be walked in 30 minutes or 1 1/2 hours and either way you will be pleased and amazed at the variety of things that are unique to Catalina. Don't miss this if you can help it. Long walk worth the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolmh874
50,Learn More About the Island,"A great destination for a bike ride, especially in combination with a stop at the Nature Center. Great videos about the Catalina Environment. The Wrigley Memorial is a handsome building dedicated to the memory of the man who made Avalon a tourist destination and offers a taste of the greater island environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edviga
40,Well worth a visit to this interesting place.,Four of us took a golf cart up to the memorial and found to be very enjoyable and peaceful. Wrigley family did a great job of keeping the island pristine and providing for the future of the conservatory of the island. The plants you are surrounded with are beautiful and the memorial is stunning. You may even see the famous Catalina Fox that will keep an eye on you so it can steal some food. Realy should visit this place if you have the opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317gregp
40,Worth the visit,"We rented a golf cart and drove here for about an hour self-guided tour. It's definitely with the visit, and the memorial was quite impressive! Great photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TayaLeReve
40,MAY AS WELL SEE THIS TOO,"Remember, not much to see and do on Catalina Island but shop so, if you just want to sightsee, this is one more place you should include. Suggest you take the trolley (it doesn't run everyday) up to the gates of the Memorial as the walk up is long and steep. Take you time looking at all the plants and trees and climb to the top of the Memorial. We chose to walk (all down hill) back to town and there are things to see as you go. Ron and Pam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avie8tor
50,Great view,We took the electric bikes up the the garden and had a blast. The electric bikes go faster than the golf carts and you get to see soooo much more! Make sure you go to the top of the memorial great view and awesome pictures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancesG_12
30,So-So,"This is a very average garden. Something that you will go as a ""one-time"" off the list of things to do in Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UandMeTravellers
30,A day at the garden,We took the bus that starts at the town square The bus only operates on Sat & Sun There is a charge to enter the Garden If you like plants it is worth the price of admission,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxy2194
40,Variety of interesting plants in a beautiful canyon,The Wrigley Botanical gardens have a variety of cactus and other plants suited to the climate on Catalina. Enjoyed walking around. The Wrigley Memorial is beautiful with a nice view of the ocean. There was a cute kit fox hanging out there; guess most visitors who hike to the memorial have seen it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,Desert Garden,Easy to walk on several trails. Wrigley video and memorial are available. Great variety of vegetation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruthg960
30,Low expectations will lead to a pleasant experience,"Set your expectations fairly low and you'll find this a pleasant enough diversion. The gardens themselves are very small, but well-tended and full of nice examples of mostly-local fauna. The memorial is a pretty darned impressive monument with a nice little view from the top. We went before 10 AM in May and saw almost no other visitors, but as we were heading back to town, we passed some pretty good crowds heading toward the garden. Go early for peace and privacy. It's a long but pleasant walk from town if you're even moderately fit - no need to take a trolley or rent a bike or golf cart unless you really want to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laene
50,Gem!,"I didn't even know this was up here until my second Catalina visit. We walked from downtown Avalon and it wasn't very challenging despite being hot and uphill (though we were 18-23 at the time, so it may be more challenging for others.) The memorial was beautiful! I'm pretty enamored with Catalina tiles and the memorial was adorned in then. This was a beautiful place, worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3228DMruthp
40,Nice selection of desert plants,The monument to Wrigley and the view is beautiful. Nice collection of desert plants in garden. Easy 1.5 mile walk from down town if you are looking for some exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyWren
20,Saw a Fox,It is an interesting small botanic garden. We saw a young fox along a small creek. Interesting desert flowers that are well cared for. Plenty of seating. A bit of a climb. Seemed a bit expensive. $ 7 Little else to do so we did it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkommers
40,Nice hike,"We rented a golf cart to come and check this place out. We only had 45 minutes before it was closed so we didn't get to see the whole place. We just hiked up to the memorial. Along the way we're several trees, cactus, plants. And it was nice and peaceful since there were few people left in the park. Wear good walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878cheyennep
50,Succulent gardens and interpretive self tours.,Gardeners and walkers will enjoy the botanical garden and the huge monument that Mrs. Wrigley had built in 1934 to honor her late husband. Along with the numerous plant specimens carefully laid out on the walking paths you will enjoy a wide variety of birds from quail to woodpeckers! Take water and a hat as it is up in a canyon and the sun can be quite hot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steven858
50,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!","My husband and I visited the Wrigley Memorial & Botanic Garden while on our stay here in Avalon. We loved the interactive information patio before we started our trek through the plants. We loved the native species garden. We loved the succulent garden of plants throughout the world - my husband was fascinated by the dragon tree in particular. We loved the memorial and its architecture. We loved the views from the the memorial. We loved the quiet. And we loved the little fox that seemingly posed for pictures near the walking bridge. Overall, it is one of the best things to do while on Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backgammom
50,Beautiful,"Had a nice visit, though we only had an hour as we wanted to catch the last shuttle bus back to town. The memorial itself is beautiful. There are many plants on the way up to the memorial at the top of the hill. Due to the drought it seemed a little dry, but hopefully we'll get some more rain and it will green up again. Husband got a free entrance for his birthday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233joyces
40,Pleasant and Relaxing Visit,"A wonderfully relaxing visit to the monument and gardens. Coming from the desert, I thought I had seen all types of cactus but there were many variations here that were very interesting. The monument itself is very interesting and well done. Entire grounds are clean and inviting. We watched all the videos at the information center which were very interesting. Would recommend a visit away from all the ""tourism"" activity in downtown Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymS1571ZG
50,Small but surprisingly rich,"I didn't expect much, we got here on our golf cart tour and figured why not because my daughter was free for her birthday. So glad we did. The flora was beautiful and informatively displayed, very easy and elegant walk up a canyon to a beautiful and historical structure at the end, a sort of open air tower one can look out to the sea from, made mostly from local materials. There was even a little fox (begging, but cute) at the base of this to greet us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPBSanFrancisco
50,very interesting,"You do not see a lot of variety, but the cause is worthy and the history is interesting. It is a great group and they deserve all the help they can get to maintain the integrity of this beautiful island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teambr0wn4
50,great walk up from the harbor!,"well worth the mile and a half stroll up from the harbor. Take water, sunscreen and a hat, as there is no place to buy drinks there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladieshaven
40,Great hike out the back,"The botanical gardens were wonderful, a great example of desert flora. Learned the names of many of the local plants I didn't know. Video was a little long. Best part was the Garden to the Sky Hike up through the back of the garden. Get permission from the conservancy Nature Center before you go, but it's 1.2 miles (pretty straight up but wide road) to a great view of both sides of the island",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clittle257
50,Wrigley Gardens and Memorial,"We rented a golf cart to visit this facility and it was worthwhile. The gardens focuses on native plants of Catalina Island, primarily cactus and succulents, as well as exotic species from Mexico, Bolivia, and Argentina. The memorial is unusual and worth a visit. It was built by the Wrigley family in the 1930s and has some historical value. This is something totally different to do on Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5178YLgaryf
50,A wonderful garden,We walked from our hotel it was quite a trek for us but well worth it! The gardens have been on my list for 30 years! YES! I finally get to check it off! Beautiful succulents that are decades old what a treasure! A great hike up to the top of the memorial that has a spectacular view.Loved all the Catalina tiles inlayed in the memorial. A must see in Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/943marypatm
50,Loved the garden,"You can take a trolley but we walked. A good hike. We loved the botanical garden, very well done and very informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894robertj
50,Take the hike in the Sky!,Must see for all ages! Walk the garden and take great pictures from inside the memorial and if you are able keep going another 1.3 miles uphill to see the beautiful crest where your hike truly meets the sky! (Hike in the Sky) This vantage point you can see both sides of the island and seas. Its truly quite spectacular!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenj353
50,Amazing place to begin a short hike,We started a hike here. There is a 1.7 mile one way hike all up hill. The views are beautiful-ocean on both sides. The fee is 7$ per person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COMom45
40,Great to take the trolley from town and walked back.,Great view from the top. Get a coupon for 1/2 off in the Catalina magazine. Would recommend this as a nice easy morning trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bld61
20,Not worth the admission,"A hefty $7 admission fee, and there is not much to see. There are cacti and scrub oak and other drought-friendly vegetation, which is interesting, but across the water in Rolling Hills Estates, you will find a wonderful botanic garden of 81 acres which will put this one to shame. Also, there is not much to the memorial itself. The climb up is more gradual if you go up to the left facing the memorial. The bridge to the left DOES have an outlet, in case you are wondering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hobolinda
50,Beautiful views,"Beautiful views, glad we made it up there. You could easily hike/walk up there, although we rented a golf cart and stopped on our 'tour' of the Avalon area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1puravida_girl
50,We make a point to visit every time,"The views are stunning. The architecture and history are interesting. At the base of the memorial is the botanic garden, which is an arid-plant garden flanking the wide pathway to the memorial. Smaller paths with markers showcasing the plants flank the wider pathway. Don't expect a lush oasis. It is, again, an arid botanical garden, with scrub oak and lots of cacti. Still a real treat for the nature lover who enjoys a leisurely walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGray3401
10,Not impressive,A steep hike to the top. Once u get there u pay to get in and the grounds aren't even kept up. Not impressed. And don't hold your breath for the trolley.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCJC808
30,"Cactus, trees, and succulents","Had an interesting collection of desert plants in a natural setting. It is a little small as botanical gardens go, but is a pleasant stroll and doesn't take very long. The sloped gravel path would be difficult for the handicapped. The Wrigley Memorial is not handicapped accessible as there are quite a few steps, but is an interesting design including decorative tile from local and foreign sources. You can see the whole thing in less than an hour unless you really get into examining the plants. It is a fairly long uphill walk from downtown, so most people would probably want transportation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okiepoke2
30,Was delightful,"Here on a Carnival cruise ship ""Imagination"" visiting Catalina for a few hours and decided to take the Avalon Trolley for $4 per person. The trolley is a slow moving shuttle car that stops at multiple stops that you can get on or off along the way. It takes one hour if you stay on and not get off. We got off at the top of the hill - about halfway from downtown - at Wrigley's famous gardens. I actually had read that it didn't look that great because of the drought, but we were pleasantly surprised that after the big rains this month the gardens looked GREAT. Lots of cactus and trails to check out with their Channel Islands Native Plants - Wrigley's collection.. You can also walk to the top of the gardens where there is a memorial to Wrigley himself. Beautiful view at the top. There are restrooms but no food. Adults were $7 Over 60 $5 Lots of people were driving their rented golf carts here...very easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlene351
40,"Interesting and quiet, great view","I first visited this in 10/2002 and we walked from the harbor uphill about 2 miles. Now I'm pushing 40 and didn't feel like hiking this hill again so we took a cab there and back. I know there's a cheap trolley on cruise days and weekends. The round trip cab was about $30. This place is just as I remembered, a lot of desert plants native to Catalina and also some plants from other continents. The plants have information about them. The view from the memorial is terrific. Not sure the drought is affecting the gardens much since it looks same as it did in 2002. Not super exciting, but it's nice to chill out away from the touristy areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ivan58_10
50,Wrigley's Best,What a wonderful day we had exploring the island. The garden is glorious and worth the walk. Use sunscreen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunflower53092
40,Endemics and Xeriscapes,"This garden is for botanists to appreciate. It features Catalina endemics and plants that are mostly adapted to desert-type conditions. The cactus was very happy. Not so much the other plants, not surprising on an island that has serious water issues due to the continued drought (and has water issues to begin with). However, it was inspiring to see which of the plants were hanging in there, despite it all.The Memorial is gorgeous, full of Catalina tile and things like blue marble quarried on the island. And the view! Wow. We were up here right at sunset, and it was spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jilara
30,Sad But Still Nice,"We visited while on our cruise. It was sad to see the condition of the garden due to the drought. But it was still a nice hike. The memorial looked a little disheveled from what I remember, but that was 30+ years ago. The view from the top was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazers04
40,Beautiful spot if you have time,"We enjoyed the beautiful gardens and Wrigley memorial. At the same time, I don't think this is an absolutely necessary part of your visit to Catalina. It was fun to walk around and it did have some great views, but the garden itself is a bit disappointing. We did enjoy taking the trolley from the beach to the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivia3335
20,"Poor Condition, Disappointing Garden","We visited this memorial and garden while off our cruise ship. We knew there would not be much to do on this small island, so took the shuttle to this location. The spot was pretty, with a view of the ocean, but the garden itself was in poor condition, - perhaps due to the drought? The memorial was interesting. Also, the woman who sold us the tickets, an old woman, was unpleasant and very reluctant to give us a map. Not the person you want to greet you and take your money! We decided to walk back to Avalon, which is a quaint town with lots of character, which took under 30 minutes, and was all downhill. If you are looking for something to do, it's a nice walk, there and back, but not worth a lot of time. But senior tickets were only $5, so it didn't cost a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylF756
50,Tree huggers paradise,"This island has a little bit for almost every age and every taste. Check it out, breathe deep and just enjoy all of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissDCWilson
40,You really should visit if your in Avalon.,"I've read some of the reviews of the Botanic Garden that I think miss the point. This is not a particularly large or extensive garden, but it contains the very rare endemic plants of Catalina and the Channel Islands along with a variety of mostly Southern California flora. Then, you've got the Wrigley Memorial with outstanding Catalina tilework and a fine view looking back at the canyon to the Pacific Ocean. I recommend walking from town if you're up to it. It's a couple of miles uphill, but it's downhill back into town where you will enjoy that cold beverage even more. Be sure to stop at the Catalina Island Conservancy which is just down the road, is free of charge, and provides considerably more information about Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeecyB
20,A steep price for little view,"My husband and I hiked Catalina Island. We took the trail head from the camp site and came in to the Wrigley Memorial and Garden from the back side. We literally spent 15 minutes in the whole place. The memorial was kinda cool, but we were disappointed in the garden. There were very few flowers to see--probably because it was late fall. Since we came in the back door, it was free--thankfully. I can not imagine paying $7 each to see the garden and memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732LauraC732
30,Away from the fray of Avalon,"First off -- this is NOT a leisurely stroll from downtown Avalon. The maps that they give you in town are not to scale -- it is close to 2 miles and it is up hill all the way. The public trolley is available for $2 each -- recommend it!The gardens are definitely suffering the stress of the current drought, so do not go expecting lush gardens. It does does look a bit spartan.The best thing: there are many plants which are endemic to Catalina Island, which is very interesting. They all have name plates, so you can tell which are the locals.Considering that the gardens are supposed to show case the local plants, I was surprised at how many Australian and South American plants there were.According to my non-horticulturist friends who accompanied me -- they said forget it; nothing to see.As for the monument, it is an throw back to a time when millionaire egocentrics built these kinds of things. If you climb to the top -- you do get a nice view of the ocean.Definitely do not make this a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EquineDoc
40,Pretty desert plants,This garden focuses on plants native to the area and to other desert environments. Nice walking paths. The Wrigley Memorial offers excellent views down the canyon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jscof
40,An AMAZING Garden and venue.,There is so much here to see and appreciate.Well maked plants and information plaques. Nice tower and viewing back down the canyon looking to the sea.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shesailor1
50,quite a monument,"you can access this by either the trolley, golf cart or walking...we spent just under 1 hour at the garden itself.....the monument is quite impressive if you walk to the top (a lot of steps)....views are impressive.......not a free activiity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/papasmurfTucson_AZ
50,Highly reccomend,"We visited the Island for a snorkel adventure and had extra time to kill before the boat left so we walked to the garden and looked around, The memorial is stunning! With a gorgeous view",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lissette1962
30,Just Ok Botanical Garden,I've been to many a Botanical Garden and unfortunately this one isn't all that great at all. There are plant ID signs and a short video but that is about it. You walk to the top of the grounds to view the memorial and get a nice view but nothing all that special. You are essentially donating the entrance fee to help the conservancy's work on the whole island because there isn't much indication that the funds are being utilized at this garden to make improvements.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464debbiee
40,"Beautiful view. Tiny, but interesting botanical garden.","We hiked from Avalon all the way up to the monument. The poor botanical garden was definitely feeling the drought, only the cacti were doing well. They looked cool and there were some that I had never seen before. The garden is laid out in an area that never strays 50 yards from the main road that leads up to the memorial. If you are staying in Avalon, it's worth the hike or golf cart trip to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/567dalew
40,Informative about plants and area.,Wrigley Botanical Gardens is best seen when the weather isn't too warm as you are hiking around with little shade. The educational center is worth a stop as is climbing the steps to the Wrigley Memorial. The plant collection including eight endemic varieties including the Catalina cherry tree and Ironwood tree. Check out the strawberry tree (pictured). Lots of discounts for admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawn92106
30,Not worth the entry fee,Just to expensive for what is offered. Very educational and wonderfully setup however the entry fee is too high to see a concrete monument and succulents.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ogreextrodinare
30,"Impressive monument, rare plants","This was our first visit to the gardens, though we've been to the island a number of times. Our visit might have been influenced by the fact it was unusually hot the day we were there and also by the fact that Catalina is suffering a major drought, like all of SoCal. Everything seemed dry and dusty, and it was discouraging to see that a number of the plants seemed to be in poor shape. But not being any kind of plant person, perhaps they were in a normal stage of having brown parts. The St. Catherine's Lace was beautiful, as were several of the blossoms on the various cacti. The Catalina tile on the memorial and in the glass display case area are beautiful. Nice clean restrooms were available. It was a nice walk up the hill through the gardens, and although we weren't able to climb the steps to the top of the memorial, we were told the view was terrific from there. The fact that we were able to see some very rare plants that only grow on Santa Catalina Island was great. There was an informative video available near the entrance. The $7 entrance fee seems a bit steep, but fortunately seniors and veterans are only $5. The trolley ride up was interesting as well, and gave us a look at some of the sites in Avalon we had not seen before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VtaTraveler
30,"Great views, nice stonework, OK gardens","We were going to walk up because we were told the shuttle wasn't running, but when we started out from our hotel, we saw the shuttle, so we boarded it and took it up to the gardens. It is definitely walkable, but it is all uphill. The gardens are pretty sparse this time of year, although at least one cactus was blooming. The memorial itself is quite striking, with a set of bronze doors and many decorative tiles. If going up to the memorial, there is a ramp on the left side, which is a lot easier than climbing the 100 steps on the right side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoloresG762
40,A beautiful historic garden with amazing plants,"Perched at the top of Avalon Canyon, the Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden is a must for any visitor to the Island. History and nature come together in the well-maintained trails. Amazing native and foreign trees flower and thrive in the garden. The succulents (cacti and other species) garden is a wonder. The only thing they could do better is to figure out how to keep the mule deer out of the place. The memorial monument is covered with beautiful and now-rare Catalina tiles. And from the garden, you can walk to the top of the ridge for spectacular views of Avalon and the canyon. Take the walk to the Garden. It will energize you and inspire you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosLdelaRosa
40,Not the Best Time to Visit,"A local man said that we could walk to Wrigley Memorial and Gardens in about 15 minutes. It took us 45 minutes and we are reasonably fast walkers -so take the bus or rent a golf cart. There are walking trails among the arid climate native plants and cacti from around the world. Because of the drought and the time of year (early fall), the plants were in a dormant state. The top of the mausoleum gives a view of the harbor. The mausoleum was surprisingly simple and unadorned for such a famous and wealthy man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87Westy
40,Nice desert garden on Catalina,"This is one of those things you should do on a trip to Catalina. It's a botanical garden, mostly of cactus and dessert plants. Supposedly some of the plants are very rate. It's at the top of the hill so you will probably want to ride a golf cart or electric bike up. You could ride a regular bike, but you should be good at hills.Once inside it's a walk through the gardens where most of the plants are labeled. You continue through the path to the top where there is a memorial to Wrigley (yes, the chewing gum guy), who apparently was instrumental in making Catalina a destination to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3RedDoxies
50,Beautiful flowers among the desert plants.,This is definitely worth checking out. The guide will explain the local plants and how they survive the dry climate. The memorial has a good view of the surroundings. Wrigley is not buried there anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242ellenk
50,Vista view beyond your dreams!,Amazing hike up to the Memorial and then you can keep going for 1.2 miles longer and see one of the most spectacular views of your life. And its a piece of cake to walk down.....amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728nancye
40,Nice little gift form the Wrigley's,"This is a smaller botanic garden set inside a canyon, but has a surprising number of biomes represented. The variety of cacti was particularly interesting. It is a relatively short (but uphill) walk from Avalon and the harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AggieJoe79
50,"Please go here, it is beautiful!","After checking out the lovely cacti gardens, we hiked to the tranquil memorial spot perched at the top of the garden. What a lovely spot for a reflective moment with a loved one, looking our over the ocean, whilst experiencing the beauty of the arches and carved stone of the small temple/memorial . This was a highlight of our trip to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTArkin
50,A garden with a view,definitely worth it to see this beautiful garden. We never miss a walk through. Peaceful and serene and a great ocean view from the memorial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaP458
30,Nice ark and hike.,"It was a nice place to visit. Not a long trolley ride to the entrance. The park is a little dry being a drought year but still very lovely. At the back of the garden is an entrance to a trail. 2.4 miles if I remember correctly. Up the mountain to a valley between the two peaks with a wonderful view of the valley and harbors no the east side and the west side of the island. Worth the entrance, of course I had a two for one. I believe there is an entrance to the trail before you enter the garden if you don't want to spend the money. It really isn't to expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858stuartv
10,"""Catalina Botanic Garden""","I am not sure what my wife and I expected on Catalina Island, but the only thing that was in the garden were different kinds of cacti. There were very few colosr other than green. I guess we expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MakeCandy
50,Wedding anniversary vacation.,My husband and I went hiking to the garden and memorial. It was quite an adventure. We saw and took very close pictures of deers and the view was breath taking.Recommended to go early though. We went around 3 pm and got a small sand storm..lolSuggest to take comfortable shoes and lots of water.All worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448janettem
30,SUFFERING FROM THE DROUGHT,I have been to all but a few of southern California's botanical gardens and seen some amazingly beautiful gardens. I was very hesitant about paying for the trolley and then the entrance fee. We did find a buy one get one free for the entry fee so I feel I did get my monies worth but very dry and brown throughout the gardens. I realize that most are cactus that are there but not even a flower in sight.We did love the building at the top with the beautiful views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
30,"Nice cactus collection, other interesting plants","We stopped here for around 45 minutes as part of our golf cart tour of the Avalon area. We liked the gardens, especially the cactus area, because we generally find botanical gardens interesting. However, don't expect lush, beautiful flowering specimens here; the island has a semi-arid climate and the gardens focus on plants that thrive on the island and similar environments.You walk up a hill through the gardens to reach the Wrigley memorial. It looks like a huge temple from below, but when you get up to it you find that it only takes a few minutes to climb the stairs up to the top and there's not a whole lot up there to see. I did it and i still found it worthwhile; just don't get your expectations up for anything exceptional. If you learn about the construction of the memorial before you go up to see it, you might get more out of the experience.Take the time to look and the minor details in both the gardens and the memorial and you'll enjoy your visit. This doesn't rank up there with the greatest gardens or monuments I've ever seen, but I didn't regret spending some time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94741233
30,Ok .. but not what we expected.,If you do not have a lot of time on Catalina you can skip this. We rented a golf cart and it was not worth the money to go up there and look around then come back down. If you are going - I would take the Trolley which stops there -- however the one way trip is 30 minutes from Avalon mainstreet. NOTE that if you do not want to climb the very steep stairs on the right hand side. Take the stairs on the left side - not as steep and not as many. I went with my 78 yr old father and had we known this in advance we would have taken the stairs on the left side. Unfortunately when we were sold Sr. Fare by the ticket office they did not share this data. When you are looking at the monument you really cannot tell that there are stairs on both sides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597carik
40,Worthwhile Island Treasure,"As daytrippers looking for a way to explore Avalon, our decision to take the trolley up from the beach to this charming place was a good one.Santa Catalina is dry ... and the well-maintained collection of cacti, trees and brush provided us with great examples of survival in arid conditions. The collection highlighted plants indigenous to either Santa Catalina itself of the Channel islands. Other parts of the world were also represented. We noted items from South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Australia.The Wrigley Memorial is an attractive, well constructed building that affords a wonderful view back down the mountain toward the sea.We regretted that we were not prepared to continue up to the top of the trail, but we lacked (a) the time, (b) sufficient water, and (c) proper hiking gear to manage the ascent. Next time we will come prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmQ305LY
40,A spectacular view awaits you at the top,"The Wrigley Memorial & Botanic Garden is a beautiful hommage to Mr Wrigley. He isn't buried there so don't let the name mislead you. The gardens are beautiful, as is the structure. You will find magnificent ocean views and great photo spots. It is a bit of a hike by foot--but if you're there for a few nights, it's a good day trip. It's an uphill walk from the beach part of town so wear good walking shoes and bring water. Once you pass the country club you have about a mile up on unpaved trails to reach the Wrigley memorial. There is an admission fee so bring cash. You can also purchase a tour that will drive you up there. If you're there for a day trip or coming off a cruise ship I would recommend you buy a tour ticket instead of hiking up there. You might want to pre-purchase your ticket because if a cruise ship is in town tour tickets will likely be sold out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabby92399
40,No shortage of eye candy here!,"The Memorial and Botanical Gardens are easily reached by the trolley which covers the main roads of the island. The shuttle drops you off at the gardens with ample time to walk up to the top of the memorial monument and take amazing photos of fog rolling in over the mountains to the east and the beautiful sparkling ocean to the west. The gardens contain manzanita, prickly pear, sage and so many more plants. Carob trees surround the monument and the tile work is lovely. A mere $7 gets you in and the visit is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/468evat
30,Cool Place to Visit,"If beach days aren't really your thing, then this is a must try! It's a 1/4 mile natural plants and cactus area trail. It's well kept but everything looks a little dry because of the water conservation due to the drought. The highlight is the monument at the end of the trail! 100 steps up and you reach a nice of view of the area. You can go even further to the top and the view is even better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelinpink01
30,Great history,"Wow the Cubs played here or nearby at one time in history. That is why the Wrigleys and the Cubs were together. Nice place, impressive, take the golf carts up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamC608
40,Interesting place to explore,"The gardens are very dry and there is not much to see this time of year, but it was interesting to learn more about the endemic plants specific to Catalina Island. There were also many plants brought in from all over the world and that was fun to see. And it was nice to leisurely walk the grounds and learn more about William Wrigley and his influence on the island. We were happy we went, but may not be for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taz525
50,Weekend getaway,"Great morning hike. Walked it both ways. Found very unique plants, felt very soothing and positive. Great place to lose yourself in and meditate. My husband and I loved this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136noemib
30,Nice morning walk,We rented a golf cart early morning and went up to botanical garden. Not a lot of plants but nice stroll. Some history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeAnnaH555
50,High and Dry,"The Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden up above the hustle and bustle of the touristy shops and water excursions and teeming hotels and busy beaches is a welcome place of solace and contemplation...if you so wish. The once ""donations only"" turnstyle has been replaced by a bonafide person-inside-pay-booth and adults must shell out $7.00 each; although there is a senior; discount. However, the improvements from times gone by are vast. There is an organized interpretive center manned by a knowledgeable, salty Catalina Island resident who is happy to dispel any mythology about the island: such as the former importation of pigs to kills rattlesnakes, the existence of the island volcano (burning at the dump) and other fictitious tales. The photos of flora and fauna are excellent and if you like geology, there are excellent exhibits discussing the rocks of the island. There are other outside exhibits and if you visit in the early summer, there are also bright-faced college-aged biology majors to trek you through the garden or to show you skull samples so next time you see one, you'll know the difference between a bison and a buffalo. However, the real meat of the matter its the extensive, healthy selection of endemic plants and exotic imports. You can wander the well-manicured paths and get close up and personal with all manner of cacti and native specimens. If you are up to it, you can climb up into the Wrigley Memorial itself, where you can see down the canyon and see the sparkle of sunshine on water in the harbor and you will also see the name of William Wrigley etched on his would-be monument, but his remains remain elsewhere. There was of course that pesky war in the mid 1940's and if Japan were to invade and possess Catalina Island, ol' Mr. Wrigley (or his body) would certainly not be there to be part of it. So if a little hike would be in your best interests and if the wind's playing with the leaves and the sun's heating up the pathways in a lovely, peaceful array of local and faraway flora suits your fancy, make a trip up the canyon. It is will worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdyoung68
40,"Nice Hike, Good View","You've rented the cottage in Avalon, you've taken the Catalina Island Conservancy tours, laid on the beach, and eaten a little to much of everything from ice cream at Big Olaf's to pasta and steak at El Galleon. Feeling a little..., full and guilty. Take a short hike (up hill) to the Wrigley Memorial. Yeah it's up hill. So what. You've got all the time you wish to do it. Along the way you can stop at the small park and rest, check out the golf course and possibly see a soft ball game. And when you arrive at your destination, you'll be treated to a remarkable view of Avalon and the Harbor. For a small fee you can enter the Botanic Garden and view the many types of flora that were placed there by the family, and climb the Memorial for an even more spectacular view.If at the end of all this you are a little tired......like I was:WAIT FOR THE CITY TRAM TO TAKE YOU BACK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansX5782WB
40,A nice view of plant life on Catalina,"Not into botanic gardens, but i enjoyed this visit. The plants were very interesting and the cacti were very unusual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80ricks80
50,"Beautiful gardens, breathtaking views, and a comfortable length hike.","We had visited the Botanic Garden years ago, but it had been during a very hot summer, so I didn't have very good memories of the experience. This time, we took the free city shuttle, for a circuitous 45 minute ride to and from our destination. It was interesting winding through the residential streets of the tiny town of Avalon. We spent another hour at the gardens, strolling through the paths lined with succulents and other native plants and then hiking up hill to the Wrigley Memorial. The views from the top were spectacular! Not too many people are willing to climb all the stairs to the top, so it is possible to spend a bit of time alone in the beautiful setting. The entire trip will take about three hours and is time well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbmegowan
50,True Island Experience & Excellent Value,"We took a $4/person round-trip trolley from the pier to the Garden. Since it was my wife's birthday she received free admission to the Garden and Memorial with my $7 paid admission.The staff at the garden was college interns, who were knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic. We received a tour of the gardens, featuring non-native plants and plants native to San Catalina Island, which concluded with a visit to the Monument. The staff also led 1.2 mile (each way) Garden-to-Sky hike, where we were able to see and take pictures of the other side of the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffrM1197LF
40,Worth the walk up all the stairs!,"We rented a golf cart to tour the town of Avalon, and this was one of our stops. The memorial is very impressive, and the garden was very interesting, especially if you enjoy succulents. The view from the top of the memorial is beautiful and well worth the hike up the stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martik2014
50,Quiet beauty,A quiet and peaceful place with a wonderful view of the Pacific Ocean and home to a California native plant garden. The main path leads to the Art Deco Memorial (many stairs to reach the top of the Memorial structure itself but also pretty to look at from below). A must do that shows the natural beauty of the island away from developed areas. Easy to reach by taking the B Trolley. It is the last stop on the B Trolley and the last Trolley to come back down leaves at 445. Water and cold drinks sold at the entry. Accepts American Horticultural Society Memberships (free entry with one).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravCat68
50,Well worth the visit.,"I always visit the Memorial and find it really beautiful and peaceful. It's a pity William Wrigley isn't reinterned here, it's a fitting legacy to his vision and love of the Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foileyer1
30,A Nice Little Hike Through Native Plants,"It's a narrow valley garden of plants native to Catalina. you stroll up one side, then climb the Memorial for the view down the canyon, then stroll down the other side. Interesting if you like cacti and botany. Probably boring for most kids. (Though they might like ""climbing up the castle"" as a little one once said of the Memorial.) An okay side trip; no big deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthotelpatron
30,Amazing view,I booked resetvations to go ziplining so I decided to walk to the botanical gardens since I love gardens. I regreted not renting a golf cart and as a new visitor I missed the fact that there was a trolley. I do not recomend walking all the way there from the pier it is a long walk. The price is resonable and the staff was so helpful and polite. My favorite part aside from the view was the bridge of knowledge. Beautiful place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em74365
50,Great walk to the memorial,"We loved our walk up to the memorial and Botanic gardens. Go early in the morning due to no shade cover from trees. It is a lovely walk. You need to pay to go into the gardens, but it is worth it. There are numerous local plants and bushes. The memorial is very well built and the tile is beautiful, made from the local stones of the island. The view at the top is wonderful. On the way back down we watched a deer for sometime wondering and eating her way down the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraw166
50,Botanical tour,"Lovely botanical garden, good views from memorial site. Small entrance fee supports park. $3-$5 only. Watch videos in shaded ramada to learn more about island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellelJ1848BI
40,Go the back way and get in for free,"I hiked the Hermit Gulch trail and it dropped us into the back entrance. It was a cool little place, we got in for free, but I think it's only like 7 dollars to get in. Really cool gardens and the tower at the end is fun to go in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ersheajr
50,Beautiful Cactus!,So of the most amazing and best condition cacti I have seen in one place. The Memorial was so pretty looked like we were in another country and t h review from up there was fabulous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanie1975a
40,Something different from downtown Avalon,"We had bicycles with us and rode up to the Botanic Garden. It was a nice bike ride, just slightly uphill. Easy with our mountain bikes, but maybe a bit more work with a cruiser bike. The Botanic Garden was interesting to walk around and to see many varieties of exotic cacti.If you are there in the summer it can get pretty hot inland during the afternoon, so do it first thing in the morning. We walked up to the Wrigley Memorial from there which was interesting. After you climb up the steps, you get a beautiful view down the canyon to the ocean.Its work the side trip if you want to see something a bit different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625kerryb
50,A little slice of heaven,"Such a wonderful expense of quiet and beauty. Loved the cacti exhibit, specifically. This slice of paradise is easy to access and easier to walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129sylvies
50,Beautiful Memorial Botanical Garden!,"If you plan to visit Avalon on Catalina Island make sure to put The Wrigley Botanical Garden on your to do list! The Garden is located about a 20 minute walk or a 5 minute $14.00 taxi ride from Crescent Ave. The Garden features beautiful endemic and imported cactus as well as trees, flowers, and shrubs, from the island and all over the world! The Garden is the one time testing place of Mr. Wrigley, although his remains now rest in Glendale at Forest Lawn, his Wife Ada Wrigley was the mastermind behind the Garden and the amazing monument to her beloved husband. The entry fee to the garden is seven dollars per person. It can be quite a hike for some people to reach the garden from the Avalon Bay because it is an uphill walk. I recommend that you take a taxi cab to the garden, as you will be doing a lot of walking and climbing the stairs while you are there. You can also rent a golf cart to drive yourself to the garden for $40 per hour. The best way to see the garden is to take a taxi there, and then walk back to Avalon as it is an easy downhill walk. The garden is a rich part of Avalon's history and if you visit the island take two hours and see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodvilencia
40,Good visit,We spent a good half day here. Walked up from the seafront. Some very interesting cacti and features.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayne-Steve
50,Absolutely Beautiful!,"The cacti were stunning and in perfect condition, and the memorial was just gorgeous..felt like I was in another country. What a place for a wedding!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/557nadinem
40,Wonderful retreat from the busy board walk and town center.,"If you have more than just one day on the Island, definitely do the Scenic Drive in one of those ever-present golf-carts -- and do stop at the Memorial and Gardens. Really beautiful. Many plants are featured that are only found on Catalina and a very nice cactus garden, with some species in full bloom.The Wrigley Memorial has stunning architecture, rising like some sort of Mayan/Art Deco temple on the hillside. Walk up the curving stairs to take in the spectacular view of the canyon and bay. Enjoy the wonderful design of the building, the many fine details and the famous Catalina tile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelScott2013
30,Long hike to an average place.,It was a long hike for us. Probably better off using bikes. The garden is mostly cactus and succulents. Wriggled memorial is an interesting building. Beautifully designed and built very fast considering the location and equipment available at that time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brillfrogs1
30,Wrigley Memorial,"The entrance fee is $7 a person. You can stroll around the botanical gardens, which are all succulents and desert plants. There are some shady parts with benches if you need to take a break. The Wrigley Memorial gives you a good view of the mountains and ocean, but you can't see Avalon from it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicki820
40,nice collection of cacti ! a hike to get to - better on a cool day .,have been here several times - and it's worth the money / entrance fee - slight high IMO - but if you like cacti - they have a nice collection -makes for a decent hike uphill and not much shade - if you are coming for Avalon but doable if you are fairly in shape . and you need to go thru here to get to the Wringley memorial. and the view from Wringley is awesome - if a clear day and the ocean breeze is delightful -,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxanneM829
50,"Historical Landmark, Beautiful Gardens","We have visited Avalon (Catalina Island) many times but had never visited the historical Wrigley Gardens. We drove our golf cart up there (about a mile), parked and made our way into the gardens after paying a very reasonable fee. The tour is at your own pace but starts with sitting down and listening to a video and history about the gardens. From there you walk through the various areas of plant life using a self-guided map given you when you enter. Each section of plant life tele you a mini story of the plants you're seeing. There is a lot of walking but many places to sit and relax as you continue the tour. It ends at the top by touring the large Wrigley memorial which is made of very rich, beautiful marble and lovely sculptures. There are quite a few stairs here but I do believe there is a wheelchair ramp towards the back. Going back towards the entrance is easier since you're going downhill but again, there are plenty of places to stop and rest. We were really glad we decided to take the time to take on this tour. There is a small area to buy some snacks if your choose. It was well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289martib
40,Beautiful view,We loved our little hike up to the Wrigley Memorial. The botanical garden is an added bonus. Beautiful view & makes for great pictures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatherfoster23
40,Great Views and garden,The garden is grouped into like areas. There are signs posted in front of each specimen and they come from all over. The view from the tower is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahd459
40,Interesting Collection,Even with limited rainfall the garden was still in great shape. Various info is available all over the grounds. The memorial building is one of the most unique spots on the island and should be visited. Recommend renting a golf cart to get from downtown Avalon to here unless you do not mind the trek...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTangoFox
50,Nice garden - but hike up the hill too,The garden has interesting sections with desert plants and with plants native to Catalina Island. But if you don't mind a 45-minute hike up a dirt road (so not too steep) you'll get to the top of the ridge and can see the open Pacific. Reminded me of Keats' poem about Chapman's Homer. Well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John_Rethorst
50,AWEsome!,"NO, not the memorial itself- but the hike behind it to the garden in the sky- Amazing! One of the greatest highlights of the trip. Shouldn't be missed. It says 1.2 miles- but it's a challenging trek all the way to the top of the island. At the top, you will be treated to the other side of the island. WAY cool! Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RRRCA
40,Magnificent Panoramic View,"We visited this garden while on a carnival cruise. We docked on catalina island & we left the boat early to explore the small island. You can book a trip with the cruise but we like to explore local so wear comfy shoes, bring a hat & dont forget the sunblock! There is a trolley that goes around the island but we hiked all the way up to this garden to take advantage of the cool weather & take off some extra calories from all that eating while on the cruise. The effect of the drought is very evident but the park is well maintained. Explore drought tolerant & indigenous plants and climb the stairs to the wrigley memorial..the view from the top is breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyan501
40,Peaceful Place,Lovely gardens with an attractive Memorial. Was nice to just sit and listen to the nature sounds. Lots of opportunities to learn interesting things about the Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alysmouse
30,"Well cared for, but desert gardens are not my thing","I think this garden is obviously much loved and well cared for, and the memorial is impressive. Clearly much care goes into it. I'm just not a fan of desert plants. But if you appreciate the beauty they offer, you will really enjoy this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gentle_heart
40,Interesting gardens,"We visited the garden on a pleasant day. Loved the cactus gardens. There were types of cacti I had not seen before. The garden also has plants endemic to the island, so those were interesting to see. The memorial at the far end gave me a good hike up several stairs for a view of the small area. The fee was minimal to get in. Parking was small, but it's mostly golf carts and bikes. Many people walk up to the area although it's quite a hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Granenaid
40,Always a favorite,"I'm not sure how many trips we've made to the botanical garden on our visits, but it is a must see for us.short hikes on the grounds and up to the memorial are beautiful. Love to see the native plants. If you're lucky, you might also get to see some wildlife.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249tanyac
40,Memorable Visit,"Really nice specimens. The park has an organic layout with some really mature (and beautiful) plants / trees. The views once you make it up to the memorial are amazing and the structure itself has a timeless and very solid feel. Make sure you go all the way to the top. If stairs are an issue, the left side will be easier to travers. Would do this again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevePSP
30,A nice way to get some fresh air and take a walk,"My husband and I wanted to get out of the main town for a few hours to get some exercise but didn't want to go on a full hike. This was about 1.5 to 2 miles outside of the main street. To get to the memorial and gardens it is a good size hill to walk up but it felt good to stretch our legs. Once you get there you pay your $7 per person and walk around a path looking and a lot of cactus and local trees. Kinda cool and we did see a few neat looking cactus but plants are not really my thing. Keep up the path and you hit the memorial, hike up a few more stairs and you are at the top. I does have some cool tiles and an amazing view. Hang out for a minute, catch your breath, take a picture and head back down the hill. It was about 2 hours round trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deelovnco
50,Loved the Garden,"We took the $2.00 trolly up the the Garden and Memorial. Really enjoyed the cactus gardens, and the view from the top of the Memorial.Easy 1/2 hour walk back into town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonstone07
30,"Amazing view, gardens are small but interesting","Its a fun hike up to this small botanical garden consisting mostly of cactus and plants endemic to Catalina Island. The memorial is an amazing stone and marble structure, worth the hike with great views and an amazing piece of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4250VGchristopherk
40,CATALINA ISLAND ON A BUDGET,"We went to Catalina Island on a Saturday. We only went for the day. Took the Catalina flyer in Newport Beach. There is all day parking at Balboa Pier for $15.00 (credit card or exact cash). Once we arrived at Avalon Harbor we walked to town. Not a far walk. Nice stroll. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and a Vons express market. Being on a strict budget we took the trolley ( $2.00 per person, one way) to the Botanical Gardens. The entrance fee was $7.00 for each person. The Garden is not too large and has a lot of desert style plants and flowers. There is also the Wrigley Memorial. Ask the Ticket counter person for a free hiking trail permit to hike ""Garden to the Sky"" trail (One mile to the top). It is a moderate to difficult walk for any person that has had knee surgeries. If you have the stamina to go all the way to the top then it is a nice hike with some awesome views of the Island. Take Plenty of Cold water, a good pair of walking shoes and maybe a walking stick. It is unpaved with loose rocks, elevated trail, and there is not any resting areas. For someone who is fit this may not be a difficult hike. As you go up you will see a beautiful view of Avalon. The top has the same View as the half way point. But if you want to reach the top you will also see the other side of the Island. Going back down can be easy for some but for someone with bad knees It can be difficult because of the loose rocks and you can easily slip. So I definitely recommend a walking stick for support.That was the only tourist attraction we did. Catalina has other attractions but it can be very costly. Other than that we hung out by the pier and relaxed in the shade after the long hiking trail...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmr97
30,Good,"A good display of desert plants as is appropriate for a water starved island. Being at the top most part of the road, the self guided walking tour of the gardens made a nice opportunity to stretch one's legs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1845YNdavide
50,A monument on the island,"We rented a golf cart to tour the island. We ended our destination at the Wrigley Monument. It was raining on the island the temperature was very pleasant. Such a majestic monument. If you are coming from Avalon, make sure you rent a cart...it's a bit of a hike but not that bad. We have done it on foot before but opted for the scenic route this time. Once inside, you are on a slight incline as you hike up the trail. The garden is amazing. If you are a history buff, visit the site so that you understand the story behind the monument. I highly suggest this for anyone with a family or just a couple looking to enjoy nature and an impressive monument. http://www.catalinaconservancy.org/index.php?s=visit&p=wrigley_memorial_and_botanic_garden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherriogorman
40,Serene,"It's a good hike up Avalon Canyon Road to the Botanic Gardens and, towering above them, the Wrigley Memorial. We've been there several times; on this trip to Avalon, we happened to go on Earth Day when admission was free. The drought has been hard on the gardens, but many of the plant species are tolerant so there is still a lot to learn about and photograph. The memorial is always inspiring and the views from the upper balcony is wonderful. There is a small concession stand at the gate. You pass the Nature Centre on the hike up so be sure to stop in there, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/getgoingCanada
40,Peaceful,While exploring the island my husband and I decided to stop and the a look at the garden. I was more impressed with the memorial as the view at the top was spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liz771977
40,An interesting place,Visited for a couple of hours on a weekday. Nice place with a lot of interesting local plants to enjoy. The memorial's design and construction is pretty interesting and offers a nice view of the valley that it sits in and down to the bay. We used this as our start point for our hike up to sky line road for a view of both sides of the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allg00dnamesaretaken
40,If you like Plants and nature this is the place,"We rented a golf cart to get to this location. It would have been a hell of a walk. So as other people made comments this isn't a place to go to if you don't like nature and plants. There is a $7.00 fee to get in as well.They have quite an extensive array of succulents and other plants. One of my favorites to see was a dragon tree.It is a self guided tour up a slope of a hill ending at the Wrigley Memorial. (We didn't make it to the Memorial as we had time constraints)As a photographer I loved the place. So many interesting plants as well as the insects that live on them. Bees, moths and butterflies we all around you just had to look for them. Pointing these out to little kids with other families made their ho hum visit a lot more interesting.I also loved the birds. They have have Acorn Woodpeckers and several other types of birds that were fluttering from tree to tree. We thought we saw a reptile of some sort but what ever it was it disappeared into the foliage way to quick to be identified.Again not a place for everyone, but if you like plants and nature you will enjoy this place. The plants are all marked so if you see something interesting you know what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVgabeg
10,Catalina Botanic garden not that interesting,"Wouldn't recommend a visit here unless you are very interested in cacti plants, it's quite pricey to enter and really wasn't worth it for a family with kids which probably should be free as they are at the Catalina museum as there is nothing for them in the garden to hold their interest and all they did was say ""when are we going"". Also a very long walk up to the monument which is quite amazing but you'd really have to want to see it. Even my husband and I who usually enjoy these types of things didn't think this visit was worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPP123
20,Better things to do,Quite a hike to this attraction. Be sure to rent a golf cart if you plan on visiting. There are admission charges and the flora is native to coastal desert only so don't expect too much. The memorial was pretty nice but not worth the hike. I would recommend doing other activities such as the glass bottom boat tour or mini golf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124lindsays
30,"Dry, but Okay To Visit.","This is an average garden. There are a lot of cacti and succulents. It's dry and I prefer lush, so that could just be a personal thing. I so have a soft spot for it because I'm originally from Chicago and have a friend who worked at Wrigley as a chemist. So, a piece of home in California.The building is cool to see, but maybe not super interesting unless you're taking photos. I didn't mind paying a little bit of money to get in since it will hopefully go to keeping it up, which it needs! Walk around, but you probably don't need much more than an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
50,Beautiful views,I have been here several times and I see the hardwork the city is putting in to maintain its beauty. OK so your thinking why do I want to see plants right ...it's so much more . It's so peaceful and beautiful here away from the buziness and back to nature. Try the moderate hike to the right of the memorial the views are amazing . It's a moderate hike so wear appropriate shoes but it's a easy 1.2 miles through winding mountain side . Make sure to take a cab or trolley to.the Wrigley gardens it's quite a hike from town .

30,Very dry there so plants are sufferinh,Sad how dry it is. Unfortunately the plants are not doing well. It was warm when we went and oddly other families were telling us we would be disappointed before we even got there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryLP
40,Unusual -- Generally Desert Environment,Interesting -- unique plants -- we were able to use the reciprocity agreement with Coastal Maine Botanic Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodericb487
40,Beautiful,The grounds were kept nice and clean. It was a beautiful little area. Peaceful. We really enjoyed the beginning to our hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeggyR593
30,A desert botanical garden leading to a concrete monument trimmed with Catalina tiles,"This is basically a desert botanical garden in a small side canyon above Avalon. There are some interesting (and occasionally unique) examples of succulents on display. Dirt paths wind through the plantings on each side of a paved road, which leads directly to the Wrigley Memorial Monument located at the head of the canyon. Santa Catalina has historically been noted for their colorful ceramic tile industry, and the Memorial is decorated with a fine display of these tiles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763RomanCB
50,A Quiet Getaway,This botanic garden is at the end of the canyon. the shuttle will get you there in just a few minutes with great views along the way. The plants are well labeled and there is lots to see. The memorial makes for some great picture opportunities. I never go to the island without visiting the garden. The interpretive center gets better and better and the staff are both friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlynnsterSanJose
30,Pleasant visit,"Had the time to visit, but nothing outstanding. Unless you are a California endemic plant enthusiast, you could skip this stop. Nice, quiet mini-garden with the Wrigley memorial towering above. Mr. Wrigley is no longer entombed there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benandme53
50,Beautiful place!,"Ok, this place is just beautiful. I decided not to rent a golf car and just walk up there. The walk is just beautiful. You can hear the unique birds sounds. The walk was about 35 minutes and definitely worth it. I paid $7 to go inside the botanical garden. The place is very well taken care. Pretty cactus and the architecture is just spectacular.Tip: i highly recommend to walk all the way to the botanical. The beauty is uncoparable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580lindseyb
30,Nothing special,"The walk to the Memorial was nice and scenic, it passes the beautiful golf course and has a manageable incline. Entry to the gardens cost $5. The gardens are a hodge podge of cactus and other native plants, no design apparent, just plantings with paths through them. The memorial was big and elaborate, but there was not signage to indicate what we were looking at or what it was used for. Pretty views from the top, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24QueenBee
40,"Architecture, cactus and history.","Learning about the history of the plants on the island, the gardens and the memorial was very interesting. The desert garden has many succulents, cactus and desert vegetation. Many different varieties of each over many acres. Take your time and learn about the unique plants and it will add to your visit. The memorial is really neat. The history of how it was constructed and the materials used was fascinating. It is very beautiful and the view down the valley from the top is great. I enjoyed the visit and know more about Wrigley the man and Catalina island after visiting. One last note about the property. After you pay the $7 or so fee for entrance the gardens begin (dirt and gravel paths) and they have a slight upward slope. As you head towards the memorial the slope increases steadily. The memorial itself has multiple flight of stairs to the top, but you can reach the base without stair climbing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPCecrle
40,A Must-Go,"Whether your first time or more, you have to check out the memorial and gardens. It's a trek to get there but worth it if weather permitting.We rented electric bikes, which was a quite a fun experience and great way to see the island.You can see clear across the water at the top of the Memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBear227
50,a window into California history,This botanical garden features many rare species that are endemic to Catalina - and is a very nice walk through the gardens plus a climb to the Wrigley memorial up on the hill. Also a very enjoyable bike ride up to the gardens from town.The Entry fee was $7 which we could pay on the honor system into a metal box while the staff were out to lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneB53
20,Don't recommend it,"We took the last trolley ride to the Botanic gardens and paid $7pp to walk through some cactus to the Wrigley memorial. They should really improve the ""botanic gardens"" to make it worthwhile",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krempert
40,It should be called a cactus garden,"it was nicely laid out with numerous types of cactus. The memorial is quite an uphill walk, with numerous steps at the memorial but the view from up there was well worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenB982
40,Mr. Wrigley is Not Burried Here,The Wrigley Memorial reminds me of the Wizard of Oz. Mr. Wrigley was supposed to be interred here but ultimately he was not. Looks like a pretty nice place for eternal rest for me. Go early in the day and you will have the whole place to yourself. The gardens are improving but are not quite as good as the gardens at The Huntington.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerrywHamilton
40,Cactus Galore!,"Kind of small but they have a nice collection of succulents and most of the specimens are labeled, which is helpful. They also have good informative videos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelBea17
40,Better than I Expected,"I enjoyed the garden and the views. Lots of cacti...but somehow it was kind of cool. I probably won't visit it if I come back to the island, but I am glad I visited it once. No regrets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneE426
40,Well worth the visit,Very impressive and thought provoking. A tribute to a great man and family. Continue the walk and head up the pass. Great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gearoido369
40,Nice Outdoor attrackting,"We were there in December, so not much is in bloom, but it is a lovely little walk through the desert plants and up to the memorial. Worth the trip in a golf-cart.....the trip itself is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adobin
50,Worth the time,"The gardens are about a mile or mile and a half hike from the city center, but well worth the hike. We enjoyed looking at all the cacti and plants. Begin by watching the video at the visitor's center and one at the entrance to the gardens. There is a beautiful memorial with a lot of tile work that is worth taking the steps up to. We also got a permit to do the 1.2 mile hike to the top.....Garden to Sky hike.....spectacular 360 degree hikes there that make the hike well worthwhile....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
50,Worth the time,"If you are interested in the history of Catalina Island and Avalon, this is a definite must-see. Start by watching the video at the visitors center, then slowly make your way up to the memorial. At the top is a beautiful view of the harbor and a great photo spot.The garden is a good hike from the city center, but easily reached by a rented golf cart or taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyS877
50,Desert on an island,"Us 4 girlfriends loved the Botanic Garden. We spent hours looking at every plant, cactus and memorial. What a lovely time. Couldn't have been nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetPeaAhwatukee
40,Beautiful cactus and succulent garden,Incredible monument to an island pioneer. We entered the garden/monument from the top after a hike on the Hermit Gulch Trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paradequeen
40,Desert Oasis,"Grounds would be spectacular with desert color in spring or early summer. Un fortunately we visited in the midst of a record drought. Memorial is gorgeous, stands out in beautiful colors, tilework is fantastic. Wished I had time to take the trail around to the backside, understand has remarkable views(approx 3miles long-easy to moderate according to sign).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ca-native48
50,The Best Botanical Garden I've Ever Seen,"My girlfriend at the time was into these gardens, and I usually found them mildly interesting. This one was the best of the bunch. Lots to see, interesting desert flora, and everything's laid out nicely. Highly recommended if you have even the merest smidgen of interest in the subject.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrpaladin1234
50,Don't miss it,"Located at the end of Avalon Canyon Rd., this horticultural exhibit is really interesting and beautiful with an array of plants that cannot be found anywhere else. There are some amazing varieties of cacti, succulents and other ""desert"" types of plants on display here that are both unusual and spectacular, some unlike anything I've ever seen.At the top of this garden is a beautiful tower structure with now a non-functional fountain and a great vista of the Avalon valley below. Beyond this structure is the Garden to Sky trail which climbs to the ridgeline overlooking the west side of the island. If you can plan ahead to do both your garden visit AND the hike, you'll make the most of your $7 entry fee ($3 for kids).We took the shuttle up to the garden ($2/person) but make the 1 mile journey back on foot. It was towards the end of the day when we returned and we were treated with lots of great views and several encounters with deer along the golf course. It's all downhill and is a very simple 20 min walk - I'd recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TR182Flyer
40,"Nice walk, great views!","We weren't sure what we would find here based on the mixed reviews, but we were very glad we made the trek up the hill. The cactus and succulent garden was very pleasant for an meander, in spite of the drought conditions. The highlight was the Wrigley Memorial which is a beautifully designed structure featuring the use of native stones and island-produced tiles. The history was quite interesting and the view tremendous. Definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSapphire
40,Fun hike!,We rented a golf cart and drove up to the gardens. The memorial was very impressive of a time-gone-by,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengirl805
40,Interesting succulents and birds,"Every type of succulent imaginable with labels on each plant and tree. Spotted a red-headed woodpecker on several of the cactus plants and palms and got some good pictures. The Memorial at the end base of the mountain is a great viewing spot. The Gardens could be kept a little nicer and the fountain could be working and the bathrooms could have been a little cleaner, however a great place to learn about the area and get a little exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771RonJ
30,Not worth paying for,"This is a great place to walk around and explore some different plants and trees, and I understand that they have to charge an entrance fee to keep up on maintenance, but this is not worth the $7 it costs to get in. It is a very clean place and has a great view of Catalina from the memorial, but thats about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyK319
40,Quite a walk..,Enjoyed the different types of plants from different countries and the view from the memorial itself was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyrR4008EF
50,Interesting area to explore,We took the trolley up from the harbor. The botanical garden is well labeled. Many of the plants only grow naturally on one or more of the California islands. The memorial is made many Catalina materials. The view to the ocean is wonderful. We enjoyed walking down the hill back to town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232dianec
30,Meh... not worth $7,"We did the Hermit Gulch Trail and ended in the back of the gardens. We didn't have to pay for it since we took the backdoor, but due to the lack of water, most plants were kinda sorry looking. The memorial is kinda cool. The hike is worth it, if u were just going to see the gardens, maybe not",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/330williaml
40,Girls trip to Catalina,The memorial and the botanic gardens are interesting. The information center on your way to the area is a must as the only thing missing was someone in the area to answer questions or point out things a tourist might not know. Maybe it was because we were there in November. Wrigley was generous to the island and his love for the island is displayed for all to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenf977
40,Large display of Cacti,Enjoyed walking through the gardens. They also had a little bridge where you could cross over and sit on a bench. It was very peaceful and serene. The walk from town was longer than we were told - about 1.25 miles uphill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathi45
50,Spectacular building and view,"We took the trolley from our Inn to the Botanical Garden for $2-what a bargain! We walked in the Garden and up the hill to the Wrigley Memorial. Once inside, it was breathtaking! The tile work and detail in the architecture were amazing! Plus the view of the Garden and all the way to the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy026
40,A must see at Catalina Island,"The information that you receive about the plant and wild life in the area is very helpful to understand the ecology of the island. The memorial itself is so impressive just to see how much effort it took in the 1930's to build something like this is amazing! And to know that Mr. Wrigley actually was buried there and that the other side of the memorial was for his wife is truly amazing! Over 13,000 bags of cement is used to build it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephG512
40,Interesting,"Since I grew up in California, there was nothing new to me. Those visiting from other states would probably enjoy this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnabelleB_11
50,Wonderful walk,We walked from Avalon early in the morning and thoroughly enjoyed having the place to ourselves. Sad to see how dry the conditions were. We would have liked some more information about the hiking trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catalinawalkers
40,Cacti Galore and Art Deco,"The garden is a nice walk/trek from the main area of avalon. If you are up for a little exercise I recommend walking to the garden and taking the trolley back to your hotel.The garden is not lush, it houses a large variety of cacti and other plants that grow well in a dry arid setting. There is an education center which plays videos on the wildlife in the area.The garden also has a an art deco structure that has interesting design. If you enter the structure you are rewarded with a nice view of the garden from above.I liked it a lot, the garden allows you to get a little taste of what the island feels like if you aren't able to hike around. It also gives you a chance to get away from the main drag for a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosaugen
50,Wonderful Collection of Desert Plants and Beatiful Memorial,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens. After reading the TripAdvisor reviews, I was expecting a smaller garden than it actually was, and was glad to mention the coupon in the Catalina Express magazine for half-off. They have a very nice collection of both world-wide desert plants and plants found only in California, the Channel Islands, and some only found on Catalina itself.The tilework, brass gates and carvings on the memorial are beautiful, and if you climb to the top to see them, you will also enjoy a great view of the valley and bay. If the stairs on your right look intimidating, try the ramp on the left as you face the memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilY72
40,Viva Wrigley!,"The botanic garden is still fine but could use expansion (the recent drought has been no help, of course). The Wrigley Memorial is a remarkable tribute to a most amazing man and his family. Without the Wrigleys, Avalon would just be a smaller Newport Beach, and the island might have been trashed. The Cubs are long gone, the Country Club is sadly no longer serving supper in its elegant dining rooms (though the Sand Trap cafe below is affordable and fun), but the Wrigley heritage continues to rule the special California-Mediterranean ambience of the island (let us hope the upscaling bug does not get out of control, and forget the middle-class appeal of Avalon). In its towering starkness the Memorial is somewhat retro, almost in the style of Mussolini Moderne, yet it isn't pretentious and the views of the valley are lovely. And the walk out to it, from town, is among the most pleasant in America. Thanks, Phil and Bill, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideY4045RM
40,Peaceful and Historic,A beautiful and serene place to enjoy the beauty of Catalina and it's history! A nice walk/hike from downtown or take the bus or a cab and walk back. A must see along with the botanical garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim_Ulcickas
50,Don't miss this Memorial of Mr. Wrigley!,Beautiful desert and take the walk up the path to read about Mr. Wrigley's life! Lots of mexican tile and history about him!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamstressm
40,When Hot-Go Early,"Very hot and humid on our recent trip in September. The garden opens at 8 every day, go early and beat the heat. Very interesting plants and cacti from the island and from around the world. Memorial was quite impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElkGroveChris
40,Well worth the short trip out of town.,"This is a great short trip to add a little something different to your trip to Catalina. You can walk (a little long from town), rent a golf cart, take a taxi or the shuttle (if it is running). We rented a golf cart and also did some cruising around town after we visited the garden. It is a relatively small botanical garden but very well done. The succulent garden is really awesome with what is there and the way it is laid out. Make sure you climb up to the top of the memorial. You get a great view down the canyon and out on Avalon Bay. It was a hot day when we were there and we got a nice cooling breeze coming up the canyon at the top of the memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgeastin
50,Great hike,One thing you should know about Catalina is that getting anywhere involves a lot of walking. The locals all use golf carts and there are only something like 200 cars on the entire island. It's not super far from the beach/hotel area to the garden though.I was surprised by how much there is to see at the garden - it's nestled back away from the shops and edges into the wilder parts of the island and it is amazing! There are wonderful plants to see and the memorial is incredible. It's important that you bring water and wear comfy shoes. It's already a long walk from the beach to the garden so be prepared to hike the gardens and to walk back. I'm not adventurous to take the bus so lace up those boots and get walking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonkeyBoy27
30,Worth the stop,"Many visitors to Catalina seem to bypass this place, not sure why. It's definitely worth the trip as it is only a 5 minute miniature golf ride away from Avalon. The garden is not too big that it will take you days to walk through. I would say you can stroll through the many varieties of cactus family in 20 minutes and up the Memorial in 10, a short quick stop but with plenty to see and awesome photos to take.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fairyknob
40,A long walk or take the bus or golf cart,"Inland, there is a desert garden, very well kept and interesting to see the many forms of succulents, cactus and drought resistant trees. If you are in good form you can climb up to the memorial to Wrigley. Be careful on hot days to drink water. There is a small museum and shop. They charge for entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzanochka
10,don't expect a call back,Julie Glass from Hamilton Cove Real Estate is supposedly a 'wedding planner' also and takes the bookings for weddings ceremonies at the beautiful Wrigley Monument. Unfortunately she will not return countless calls or emails to take your booking or actually plan your wedding and from the reviews of her real estate business they operate in the same manner. It boogles my mind that they are able to operate a business when they clearly don't care about anything they do. Wrigley Monument should be embarrassed to have her as a representative. She gives the entire island a bad name.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/470eugenes
50,Beautiful,"For all of you that are hikers, walkers, nature buffs, etc. this is the place for you! This is a great walk from the town of Avalon up to the Wrigley Memorial, very scenic, lots of wild life, great photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatdoyouwhat
50,Awe Inspiring,"Mr. Wrigley made Catalina Island the tourist destination that it is today….and there is a beautiful memorial build in his honor. It was something we hadn't expected while out tootling around in our golf cart, but certainly a nice surprise in the middle of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mjcalkins817
40,Love the hike,"I love the hike from the pier to the gardens. It takes about one hour. you get the real slow life pace of island life on the hike past the golf cource, bird bark and the school. The views are ok, It is the natural plant life I like the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nissan1515
40,"If you have a great interest in the cactus,this would be perfect for you","The walk from town was longer than expected so we took a trolley to the gardens.That was a lovely ride.The weather was quite hot so for me personally, i was unable to enjoy the various plants that day.It was quite peaceful and I would consider re visiting it when I return to the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639vanessap
30,Expected a little more for admission price,"To be fair, there was a wedding held the day we visited, so we couldn't see much of the actual memorial. Regular admission is $7 a person. My parents got in with a senior admission at $5, and I got in with a student discount at $3. I felt this would otherwise be free to visit at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. There was a small exhibit just beyond the admissions gate explaining the grounds, but it was hardly engaging. It was a good easy less than a mile (?) walk past some native plants and cacti to get to the actual memorial. If we'd paid $21 as a family to get in and walk around, I would've felt rather disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halo345
50,Wrigley Memorial worthy of seeing,"Granted you have to have some interest in cactus, succulents, and/or native plants to fully enjoy the botanical garden, but it has some good specimens. It is a good mile + walk from town, with a slight uphill slog. In the summer there is a shuttle that travels all around town for $2. The monument is worthy of seeing and is very nice, with sculptural details of plants, ravens, and other birds. There is also a lot of the famous Catalina tile, and arches. There is a great view from the top. To the right of the monument is a trailhead. You need a permit that you get at the conservancy office, along with trail information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gilbert00
50,"The Wrigley Memorial is beautiful, and very peaceful","You can either walk up, or take a trolley up. The gardens have all sorts of exotic plants, some of which are Catalina exclusive plants, and the memorial building is beautiful, and worth the walk. Gorgeous catalina tile used throughout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaxmanLG
30,Interesting,"Self guided botanical garden was OK. For the price, they should give you a brochure with history and more info about Wrigley. Great view from Memorial. A nice walk from downtown Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmL6623DW
40,"The memorial is nice, a bit of a uphill walk","The gardens is a snor, but the memorial is pretty cool. You can drive a gold cart up and spend 30 min here to break up the day a little",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/807philipk
30,Hot & Sweaty,"UGH, it was so hot up there, there is no water in the stream as we are in a drought. It was a bit boring for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candlecraver
30,It's okay,There's not all that much to see for the price unless you are from outside California. Just a memorial and lots of indigenous plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Consumerguy1
40,"Nice long walk, and worth it","We walked to the Memorial and Garden from downtown, which provided our daily exercise and was itself interesting, passing by the golf course and the place where the Cubs used to train. The garden itself is fascinating, mixing indigenous plants and tress with others from around the Southwest. Frankly, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The Memorial is impressive for its scale and for its tribute to self-indulgence, as the Wrigleys created it for themselves. The view from the top is outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckW561
30,Seen Better,"It was a long walk through a very hot and dry desert garden. I've seen better in my travels, but a good example of the natural topography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaSunrise
40,Climb is worth it,"Beautiful blue flagstone, tile, carvings of the monument and variety of succulents, cactus and plants native to Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanDiegoborn
40,A GREAT stop off when doing your own self guide glof cart tour of Catalina!,"We discovered the Garden and Memorial on our map as we started our golf cart tour of the island, and if proved to be a wonderful afternoon stop-off.Wonderful, 'natural' gardens with an over abundance of native island and California flora with a few wonderful imports... purposely not a formal manicured garden, an amazing variety of cacti and succulents.The informal garden paths eventually lead up to the Wrigley Memorial, another high-styled 1930's art deco style masterpiece, with amazing stair case, multiple levels and look outs, fantastic decorations, details, carving and tile work - again all Art Deco perfection... culminating in a top level memorial archway looking out between mountain peeks to the blue ocean.This style of garden and flora selection may not be everyone's first choice, but our visit proved to be a very relaxing and enjoyable stopover, providing some wonderful photo op's and a get respite during the golf cart tour.Not to miss if you have the time while on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianwickens407
30,Not a lot to see!,"Cactus, hills, concrete memorial, a makeshift porta potty and a dirt road. Not much more to see. ):!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggnickelimages
50,Wow! what a beautiful place! such beautiful views!,"A must do when you go to Catalina. It was totally gorgeous. So beautiful, breathtaking views, you'll love the pics you can take here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathySchmidt2014
30,Disappointing,Very Arid when we visited in late May unlike Britain the Americans seem to charge fees for everything the above being a prime example the park is in a naturalised state so no team of Gardeners are employed so should be free to all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulineT780
50,Great ride & happy hr,"We had complementary bike rentals w/our great hotel stay at the Catalina Beach House so we took advantage of the beautiful weather & used the 2hrs to adventure up the hill to the gardens. The ride/walk up was trying but worth it, to get to the gardens & see the nice plants & trees, then finish the hike to the top to the gorgeous memorial. The reward is the fun bike ride coasting back down hill & stoping at the Sandtrap for happy hr w/$1 tacos & beer ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702chaundra
30,One Way to Get Exercise in Avalon,"My family were visiting Avalon for a few days and as this is one of the unique things to do in Avalon, decided to walk to the memorial. From town, it's maybe a 20 minute walk up a slight incline...nothing strenuous, although it looked like most people were driving golf carts to the memorial...save your money and get some exercise. At this time of year (May), there was nothing in bloom, so it's basically some walkways thru cactus and succulents. You then reach the memorial, which displays beautiful Catalina tile throughout. At the top, there's a nice view of the ocean, but for me, it was seeing the beautiful architecture and old tiles that made it worthwhile. It's something to do, but not a have-to-see spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sc1009
30,Something To Do In Catalina,"We enjoyed our hike through the cactus garden and the climb up the memorial, but it's really nothing special. We rented a golf cart and stopped along the way so it was fun but I wouldn't make a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ray94611
30,Uphill Walk,"The walk to the gardens and memorial may be challenging if you are not used to walking uphill. Cab ride starts at $14 for two and a $1 for each additional person. Trolley cost $3 a person but only available when the cruise ship is in the harbor which I feel makes the rest of us tourist not as important to the town. Don't expect flowers in this garden, it is dedicated to Drought resistant plants. The monument is historical and very artistic - great for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gRosamondM
40,Nice Place,This is a small but well kept garden of the local area plants; and the memorial was done very nicely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaSue56
50,DRAGON TREE,"My wife and I visited the island in celebration of our 12th anniversary, the memory made is priceless!! Thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101edt
30,stairs and gardens and stairs...oh my,"We took the Red Trolley to the memorial. the garden was very nice but we were more interested in the Memorial. If you go here, take the ramp on the left. The stairs on the right are STAIRS....lots of them. The stairs on the left are more ramp style than anything. The view from the top is amazing. There are hiking trails throughout the place. It was beautiful. Bring your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zwicked
30,Cacti and Natives,Although well laid out and labeled this is not a must see. We passed through it on our way to the Garden to the Sky Hike. The Memorial is not that overwhelming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409GD
40,"Take the trolley, allow one to two hours, hike","For a couple of bucks each way, you can take the trolley up to the gardens. It is hilly. Entry fee 7.00, and self guided tours. You can see several videos on different subjects. Lots of native to Catalina specimens, labelled. Bathrooms. A hike to Wrigley Jr. monument, with many stairs, but the views once there are worth it. Very dry due to the drought but still picturesque and many great photos taken. If you are into xeriscaping, you will for sure enjoy this or if not the architecture is still beautiful. The trolley sounds a little iffy with grinding gears and lurching to and fro, but driver experienced and lots of windows to see the golf course on way up, which was spectacular. We caught the trolley at the Plaza in town, just call to make sure they stop for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anymember
40,Interesting flora...,"An uphill walk from town to burn off the large breakfast. A buy one get one coupon was available from the Catalina Express magazine! Although only a few cacti were flowering, it was still an educational and pleasant excursion. The Wrigley Memorial was an amazing feat of tile work and stone carving with heavy bronze doors. A ""bucket list"" item.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracy805
50,Amazing,For the convenience of the wanna be hikers the Avalon Trolley runs every hour on the hour from each of the six or eight bus stops to the entrance of the gardens. Then you can enjoy a comfortable walk to the Wrigley Memorial while enjoying the flowers and fauna. Plants and trees from around the world as well as plants that are endemic to Catalina are usually blooming in the spring sand summer. A very pleasant way to spend an hour or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gullliver123
40,Wonderful views & plants,The cactus gardens were fantastic with many varieties and some in bloom. The walk was very gradual and pleasant. We even saw a small coyote hunting in the underbrush. The Wrigley Memorial was very impressive even with the many steps up to the top. The views from the top are fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdncarol1
30,Probably a decent attraction for horticultural buffs.,"We were in Avalon for a two day, one night stay and thought the Botanical garden and Hike to the Sky would be something that would be worth doing. It's a long walk to the garden so we took the trolley for $4 p/p, which also gave us an overall view of Avalon. The entrance fee is $7 p/p ($5 for seniors) which seemed a little steep but since we were already there, we paid. There might be more to the garden than what we saw but walking up the main trail to the Wrigley monument offered only the cactus garden as the highlight. We got about half way up the Hike to the Sky trail and decided we weren't adequately dressed/prepared for the somewhat strenuous hike so we turned around. We got back to the entrance at the time to catch another trolley an hour after our arrival and took it back. If you consider the trolley fee added onto the entrance fee, the experience wasn't worth it. It might be better for someone spending several hours there and seeing all the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oakprk
40,"Scenic view, great for taking pictures","Recently visited Catalina this past Valentine's weekend. First off, be warned that as other reviewers have mentioned, the walk from Avalon to the gardens is all uphill, a gradual incline, and even bike riders were having trouble making it. Second, the fee for the gardens/memorial is steep for what you get ($7.00 per person) and the gardens themselves are small. However, the memorial is high up on a hill and affords fantastic views of the island, as well as super spots for taking memorable photos. When we were there, it was quite busy with other travelers, so we had to wait to get our pictures on.TIPS: Take the trolley, which has a few stops in Avalon, and it will take you all the way to the memorial for just $2 per person. Well worth it, as the walk there can be quite gruelling. Walking back is a breeze, its all downhill and goes by fast, especially if the weather is nice!*The memorial is FREE for Active military and their families, and if it's your BIRTHDAY. In addition, there are COUPONS in the various tourist magazines that you see in the hotels. The coups are good for FREE admission!! Save that $7 per person...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieandgeorgem
40,Botanical Garden,Did not go to the Wrigley Memorial (too much stairs/walking) but did enjoy the Botanical Gardens and the videos with information about the flora and fauna in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811kathyd
20,not worth the money,"bus goes there and if you take golf card you will go here. can go in for a fee of 7$. Went in december, there was nothing ""botanical garden"" to see, just some desert plants with information about them(if you been to Huntington gardens this will not appeal at all) and memorial is at the end but you have to walk up stairs (not good if you are old or have children).so if it is good in other months i dont know, in winter not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vkailash
40,Beautiful quiet place,"Even this place is little distance from pier, but still its really nice to visit and learn about plants. Also quiet place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COOLDUDE0110
50,Nice view from the top of the memorial,"This is atop a hill. One can try to walk there from Avalon, but it was a bit far for us the first day, so we turned around. Next day we took a taxi. If you get the coupon in the Catalina Island brochure on the ferry to the Island, you will find a coupon. It will let 2 in for the price of 1, which was $5 for seniors. It is uphill to the tall memorial, which used to have Wrigley's tomb, but it was removed during WW II. You can climb the tower. The first circular stairway gets you to a nice balcony. The second circular stairway gets you to the top, where the tomb used to be. The flooring is blue slate (from the island). The inlaid tiles were also made on the island. The botanic garden has garden plants unique to the island and CA. It also has all sorts of cacti from various parts of the world. These are labelled. As you enter, to the left, there is an informational display with videos explaining a lot about the garden and the building of the tower. There are also restrooms there. There is no cafe, but I saw a few bottled drinks for sale at the entrance booth. Probably you should take your own water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annies529
50,"A well-maintained ramble through Catalina's plant legacy. of species,","Whether introduced or endemic to the island, the many carefully tended species give a look into history and Mr. Wrigley's vision. Some are ancient. All are intriguing and beautiful to behold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonomaValleyWoman
50,So beautiful...,"I wish that I was better prepared for this trip. We decided to walk from the middle of town to the garden. We heard that it was about a mile...wrong on so many levels. It seems way more than a mile, especially since most of the walk is on an incline. If you decide to walk, bring water and stop along the way if you need to use the restroom. However, the walk is lovely and we saw the most amazing woodpeckers going to town on a few telephone poles. You can rent an electric bike or a golf cart is you're not a fan of walking. Once you reach the garden, wow, it's just so beautiful. There are so many varieties of cactus and they have it landscaped so beautifully...plus you can touch. It really is just so beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingletonFamily
30,Wouldn't pay $7 again,"We needed to access the hiking trails which started inside the park. Paid $7 (adult) and $3 (student) for my boyfriend and I to gain access.The botanical gardens held some interesting cacti to look at.. but the monument/memorial itself was not impressive.The hike (Garden to Sky) was pleasant and we enjoyed the views of Avalon. We saw some deer along the way, which was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenvin
50,Fabulous view and walk through cacti gardens,"Traveled up to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden on rented Segways (but that's another story). Walked up through the gardens on the right to the memorial. Walked to the top of the memorial to enjoy the incredible view and then walked down through the gardens on the left. Very interesting site and the scope of the variety of cacti was amazing. Would definitely go again if we're ever back to Catalina Island, which we hope we can visit again, as we totally enjoyed our day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alectric9
40,the views are great but the gardens not so much,"lots of the same type of plants and everything was very dry. We were disappointed about the upkeep of the whole gardens in general as well as the Wrigley Memorial. We had to pay a small fee to enter and then found out it's easy to enter the facility without paying as told by several people we met on the trails. The trails are tough but worth the views from various vantage points. You can hike forever as there are many different routes to follow, though the direction signs aren't super clear to follow. It's a bit of a walk from town but quite doable. It get super hot and the sun can be strong so be prepared with a hat, water, and sunscreen. The review of very good is based on the hiking trails and views from the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rnjtravel
40,Great place for a hike,"The Botanic Gardens were not terribly impressive, but there is a good bit to see, the part we really enjoyed was the Garden to Sky hike that takes you on a winding path up the mountains where you can see the whole side of the island. Really beautiful and an easy hike of only about a mile or so each way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itzarosielife
50,Wonderful!,What a gorgeous garden....great hiking trail directly behind the botanical gardens. You can hike for a few hours or all day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/refmom

40,Worth the trip uphill,"The Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden is definitely a steep trip from town if you're on a bike or foot. My husband and I walked up and back, and enjoyed the journey even though we were exhausted at the end. The Botanic Garden is a great collection of what you can see everywhere else on the island (succulents, cacti, etc). But the Memorial was the highlight for me - it feels old and forgotten and beautiful. $7 admission per person when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/302KatieT
50,Nice Lil' hike,"We traveled from our hotel to the Memorial on foot and went through some of the wooded areas as well and it was a beautiful walk. Make sure you get a hiking permit if you're wanting to go higher than the memorial. Also, we took the trolley back down b/c it was only $2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staceofbase13

30,Go in the winter,"The botanic garden and memorial are located at the top of Avalon and if folks tell you to walk there ignore them and take the trolley/bus. We walked up which took about 1 1/2 hours and a few water bottles; bring water. Once there you walk through various collections of local plants but most we saw were showing signs of a sever lack of water, and several although were labeled for identification were dead.The memorial was good from an architectural view point. Why it was built was not discussed, nor was the reasoning for the location. At the top were several areas built in to the structure which appeared to be missing statues or something. We also noticed at the base of the memorial was a fountain but again it was clear that it had not been used in many years. From the top you could see the ocean but not Avalon harbor so again why the location. If you are a plant person you might be better served to visit after they have had a few rains. If you are going to expect to be in a park like setting we would not recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/600BobF600
40,Great views,"The garden alone is worth the bike ride up! Loved all the different plants and how it's organized. The Memorial is quite pretty and the views from the top really nice. I probably would not go again unless it was a different time of year, to see different flowers in bloom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jollyone333
40,Succulents galore,"Take the trolley up and enjoy an hour at the garden. The climb up the Memorial is not a taxing as some make it out. If you take the path to the left of the Memorial, it is a little easier on you knees. The path to the right is about three to four flights worth of stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicago_traveladdict

The views from the top are lovely, and the paths through the botanical garden are quite interesting. All of Santa Catalina island's known endemic plants are on display, and there are cacti and succulents from around the world ... many of which are HUGE!

My husband, almost 3 year-old son and I went with another couple and their 2 year-old and we all enjoyed it. There are so many plants to see and the Wrigley Memorial is beautiful. You can climb the stairs to the top and the view is awesome. It's definitely a great place to visit while in Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeDavLosAngeles_CA
40,Lovely view from the Memorial,"I recently toured Catalina, riding my bike up the canyon to the garden and memorial. A little known fact is that you get free admission presently on your birthday. I walked up the perimeter path of the garden up the far left side, enjoying the marked plants, the SHADE and the picnic lunch I had brought as I sat on a bench under a Himalayan pine. Birds came and went but not very many people on that path. The Memorial has impressive architectural features and the climb to the very top is worth it for both those features and the view out to the ocean. If you like succulents and cacti and learning about native plants, this is a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtogo09
30,Away from the crowd,"This is a small garden set up primarily for the purpose of highlighting endemic species of the island, with an area of cacti and succulents. It was so tranquil, especially after the crowds of Avalon's waterfront section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/566km

40,Rent a golf cart and stop off!,"We rented a golf cart and stopped off here to tour the gardens and memorial. It was interesting to see the different cacti and succulents, and gave us ideas for drought-resistant plants at home! Our kids enjoyed climbing all the stairs to the top of the memorial, and we were glad we did to see the detail in the artwork and architecture at the top! (You will end up with a 2 hour golf rental instead of 1 if you so stop and tour here, but i recommend it!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crvd
50,"Desert Garden, Spectacular Memorial","The nicest thing about the garden, besides how well kept it is, is the clear labeling of each plant and tree. It all leads up to the stone, concrete, marble, and tile memorial that was originally built to house the remains of the infamous Mr. Wrigley (who apparently is no longer interred there). The tiles were all made right on the island, at a tileworks created by Mr. Wrigley expressly for that purpose.The views from the memorial are spectacular, but the real gem is taking the 2.4 mile round trip hike the the top of the ridge. The hike is pretty steep going up, but its all on an open fire road. We were there during the middle of the day, so we only saw evidence of the native island foxes (a subspecies found nowhere else in the world). The view from the top is truly breathtaking, looking down on the Avalon harbor, looking across all the way to Long Beach on the mainland, and looking to the east at another of the Channel Islands (San Clemente?), all from the same spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/784BobH
50,"take a bike or a hike, or a golf cart there",The cactus gardens were wonderful and memorial looked over Avalon. It is worth seeing if you are on the island ! Wrigley family played a big part in the development of Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennB446

40,"Cactus, Wrigley Memorial, Quiet Lovely Place",Easy trolley ride or golf cart up canyon to this quiet little botanical garden. Formerly the resting place of Mr. Wrigley before they apparently moved him to LA area. Lots of cacti from all over. Short film. Great views from the top. It is an easy stroll to the monument. Only $4 for a senior. Well worth it. Closes early so watch your times. An hour to an hour and a half is more than enough. It was warm and dry when we went and we were glad we took bottled water. A nice peaceful side trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWS55
40,"Scenic, pleasant & peaceful. A delight for flora & architectural photographers...","I enjoyed many things about the experience ...Getting there: We walked from town, hoping to board a trolley if one went by. The trolley never went by so we just walked it. It was a pleasant walk but all uphill.What timing! Just as we arrived at the Memorial a trolley pulled in. I later learned that the trolley runs once per hour. I later measured the distance on google maps & it is 2 miles from the boat.(The free Avalon maps & information omit some important information like distances to various attractions, nor tell you the trolley schedules. The maps are not to scale - around town they seem to have a fairly consistent scale but the road up to Memorial is actually much longer than it appears on the map)Information kiosk: Just past the entrance gate is a small informational display about the islands, the flora & fauna and conservation. Just enough to be interesting and not so much that it's overwhelming. My favorite video was about the eagle programs. I really appreciate that this area is maintained by the Catalina Island Conservancy.Gardens: An unpaved road with climbs gently up Avalon Canyon. There are many side paths meandering through desert gardens & gardens of endemic plants. Compared to huge major gardens like the Huntington this place is small, specific and intimate. It is very nice, pleasant and peaceful. This is a perfect spot if wish for a little peace & quiet just beyond town. I wished we had brought some lunch for a little picnic.360 garden view on this link: http://www.360cities.net/image/botanical-garden-catalina-island#-236.23,-2.77,109.6The Wrigley Memorial has many interesting & beautiful Mission style & Art Deco architectural elements. Curving staircases on each side takes you up to the 2 levels. Each is different so take both for the experience. From the top we were rewarded with scenic views down the canyon to the ocean & a cool ocean breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B0hdana
50,A must see destination,"Up the canyon road either on foot or by $2 trolley, this wonderfully quiet well kept memorial & garden should not be missed. Along the way you can stop by the Conservancy museum, take a break and enjoy their island information features. You'll pass the golf course too where cheap tacos and cold beer make the trip even better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avohill
40,Lovely views!,"We rode the town shuttle ($2/person one way) up to the garden and walked around the garden on our own. There is a small film viewing area with six short films. We watched four and then walked up to the memorial. GORGEOUS VIEWS from the memorial! The memorial itself is architecturally interesting, too. I enjoyed wandering through the gardens seeing the native plants. Many were not labeled, though. The side paths are more interesting than the main wide path, especially the side path that goes over a bridge (from the entrance it is on the left; from the memorial heading back, it is on the right). We watched the last two short films before heading out. The eagle information was the most fascinating to many people around us, but I personally liked all of them except the Trans-Catalina Trail one. The only reason I didn't like it is they didn't talk much and we couldn't see much of the film due to lighting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinSDCA
20,Snoozeville,"Not sure where I got the idea to go here but with only a day on the island this was a complete waste of time. We walked up the hill which was a nice way to walk off our breakfast but for $7 per adult this is so not worth it. From the entrance up the hill to the ""memorial"" which appears to be some sort of unfinished edifice..basically a grand staircase there are lots of succulents along the 200 yards and that is it. The view (pictured) I guess I was thinking would be much grander so that was the big let down. Upon reflection with the constraints of time we would have been much better of walking up the hill to Two Palms(?) I think it was called to get the iconic shot of the harbor. We did take the trolley back to town but while the schedule indicated it ran 20 and 50 minutes after the hour (from Wrigley Memorial) we waited from 15 minutes after until 50 (should have walked back)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mctrvl
50,Time well spent.,"While waiting for the ferry to take us to our vacation destination on Catalina Island it was suggested we look for the Memorial Gardens if we had time. This was not something we had planned to do, but we had time and decided to take the walk up to see this and I am so glad we did. Catalina is a desert island (not deserted, desert...) and the plant life collected was all from hot, dry climates as well as indigenous plants. It was a spectacular assortment of strange looking plants in an easy to view layout. The end of the gardens leads you to the Wrigley memorial, a pretty special spot on it's own. As a tribute to the man who preserved the natural environment of Catalina I think anyone who visits this special place owes him thanks. The tile work on the monument was fantastic and the view from up top was breathtaking. Not for kids, especially young children, but anyone who appreciates the natural environment will enjoy this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanBikes

The attendant was a bit nasty too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellajuliet
40,Gorgeous view,"We walked it from the dock to the memorial and it was a nice mellow walk. The gardens are mainly cacti and shrubs, nicely maintained. The main attraction is the memorial, the architecture and once your reach the top, THE VIEW.Something nice to do while in Catalina Island. Btw: I am glad we walked because on our way back we saw a momma dear and her doe. We were just a few small feet away from them as they were grazing on grass. Such a treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aztkdiva

40,"A lovely walk, and wildlife too!","This is a bit of a stroll, but the fit will be rewarded. It's about 1.5 miles from Avalon town, gently uphill all the way. The good news is that there's a lot to see: Catalina's famous Bird Park (ca. 1920s, at one point a dazzling aviary), a Field of Dreams-like baseball field, the island's cute little golf course, the Conservancy's Interpretive Center (meh), and a scruffy if charming campgrounds. If you walk early (dawn) or late (dusk), your chances of seeing mule deer and maybe even the famous Catalina fox are good or better. The Wrigley Memorial is mostly a botanical garden with an imposing cenotaph at top. It's not exactly Disneyland, but it's peaceful and serene. Skip the golf cart and stinky busses and hoof it. You won't be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poochkin
50,Great day hike,"Lovely hike through residential Avalon and up through a canyon to a fine, dramatic little garden of succulents and the Wrigley memorial. Figure on hiking 2 1/2 miles round-trip.

50,Hike to Wrigley Gardens,"After a morning spent walking to the gardens over 5 hours , the flowers from the cacti and succulents was a great photo opportunity . The tiles on the memorial and the view down the path provide great photo opportunities with HDR. The walk is a good way to get there with the sand trap on the way for a drink or food , and an artist house on the way providing a great diversion",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deadlyraptor
40,A Memorable Place to Visit,"This was a bit disappointing but worth going to see. Trails along the main path have mostly cacti and pine trees.

50,A wonderful way to spend an afternoon.,This is a great place to come wander for half a day. The admission is reasonable and I'd like to think that it goes towards maintaining the place. There are lots of little wandering paths through the botanical gardens with lots of different plant varieties. The memorial itself is amazing and the views from up there are beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriceD97341

30,Garden Walk,"There is an entry fee of $7.00. For my exprience while visiting here, this seems a bit pricey. This fee allows you to visit the garden and the Wrigley Memorial.The gardens contain labled plant material along the main walkway up to the memorial. The memorial is a great art deco designed structure with specacular views down the canyon and adjacent hillsides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rome949
50,Watch out for the walk!,"We didn't actually get to visit this attraction, but didn't want to give it a bad rating. We were in Avalon while on a cruise with the Sapphire Princess. This was not a day the cruise ships normally came in, so they scrambled to get the drivers out to run the trolley. I suppose they could only find one, as the trolley ran by the stops only once per hour, stopping at 3:30. As we missed the trolley and didn't want to stand for 50 minutes, we decided to take the ""30 minute stroll"" as the website for Wrigley stated. Wellllll, it is farther than the mile and 1/2, and took us about 45-50 minutes. (we are pretty decent walkers). It is an uphill climb and got fairly warm the farther from the bay we climbed. Then, by the time we got there, we discovered the last trolley was leaving at 3:15. (It was 3:05) so we had to just take the trolley back down in order to make the ship embarkation at 4:30.. We were disappointed. Maybe next time.The golf carts in town look fun, but run $40 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marilyn540
40,Definitely worth a visit,"I would say this is definitely worth a stop. If you make the golf cart circuit it is a place you can stop. The botanical gardens focus on cacti and succulents but also feature other native plants. The memorial is fairly impressive and has a nice view, worth the climb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raroach
30,It was just ok,"My wife and I walked through the botanical gardens and were underwhelmed. The indigenous plant life of the island didn't seem all that different or interesting. The memorial (former tomb) was neat, with a good view, but other parts of Avalon had more picturesque views. Not really disappointed, but not really inspired either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weymot
50,Visit the garden and hike garden in the sky,This is not a flower garden but a memorial garden and a great cactus garden. You can also hike up the mountain to see stunning views of Avalon and the Pacific Ocean. We also hiked to Lone Tree Point. Its a beautiful hike above the clouds and on a clear day you can see other channel islands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dld10
40,Worth the hike,"It's about a 1.5 miles and worth it. If you have trouble walking rent a cart, bike, etc. It's a great display of different cacti and succulents. The memorial is impressive as well and provides a great view back to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishTomKat
50,Must see!,The gardens are beautiful and the memorial was definitely worth the 1.5 mile walk from town. This is a must see for anyone visiting Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateL723
50,Worth the hike,"If you have a few hours and the weather is decent, make the trek up the hill to the Wrigley gardens. The sprawling botanical gardens showcase many of the species endemic to the island and provides a peaceful respite from the noise of Avalon. At the top of the hill is the Wrigley memorial, a hike up the hill and then many stairs (take the left side) is worth the views from under the dome. Beautiful Catalina tile compliments the green valley and ocean views. I try to spend as much time as I can up here every time I visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doctamale
50,Beautiful spot with a Chicago connection,"As a senior, the $5 Admission was not a big deal. I'm not a botanist, but the plantings here were very interesting.Loved the Wrigley Memorial. Great views/pictures from the top of the monument.Two paths to the monument ... the main road and a woodsy path. I took the woodsy path and freaked out over the ever present sound of bees. I was pleased to emerge from the woods without angering any of the denizens.Chicago Connection (spent 28 years there): The brass doors at the monument and Wrigley himself. Excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/striderforth
50,Underrated! Awesome hike!,"I have seen reviews of people saying that this garden didn't look like much to them, but WOW were there some cool succulents and desert plants! Yes, the optional video just off to the left from the entrance is pretty insipid, and no, the gardens are not very big, but the plants are pretty neat if you know what you're looking at.My boyfriend and I decided to do the ""Garden to Sky hike"" which starts just to the right of the Wrigley Memorial itself (which is kind of a cool example of what state-of-the-art architecture used to look like). At this point, we had already walked the mile or so, slightly uphill the whole way, to get to the Memorial and Botanic Garden. And once we started on this trail, it got steeper and stayed steeper (maybe 30-40% grade?) for the whole 1.2 miles up to the top of the hill. It was definitely doable, and you SHOULD! The views were so, so worth it, and it felt great to make it all the way to the top. From there, we could see both sides of Catalina Island, and Avalon was just this teeny little cluster of buildings way off in the distance. Seriously some of the best views of the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robyn987
50,Excellent choice,Highly recommend this place. You see the place on your own which is great - no rush - do it at your own pace. Admission is quite reasonable. Location is awesome. Outstanding views of the ocean and mountains/hills. This place is a heaven for photography buffs. Take your camera with extra batteries as there will be a lot to see and photograph. The flora here are awesome as well. Plan on spending about 2 - 3 to properly see the place. Would highly recommend walking to the gardens from Avalon. It is a one hour uphill walk but doable. You will enjoy the scenery along the way as well. Enjoy the sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Saul
20,Totally Underwhelming,"We took the 2 mile walk from the waterfront to the Wrigley Memorial, which was a pleasant 45 minute walk, and arrived at the memorial. The memorial is a cactus garden and indigenous plant garden, built in 1934 and it looks it. The memorial, at the far end of the garden, should be billed as an ancient ruin rather than a memorial to anyone. However, William Wrigley Jr. was the owner of the Chicago Cubs, which is also a ruin that has gone 105 years without winning the World Series, so the place works as a monument to where old Cubs go to die!They want $7.00 a person to view this wreck. I'd walk up to the gate, take a quick look, and turn around and take the two mile walk back to the harbor and have a coffee and a cookie with the $7 you save.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike_wexler
50,Great memorial and gardens,We walked from the harbor to the memorial. the memorial has a spanish theme and is covered in beautiful tiles. the gardens had a large variety of cati and native plants.You can take great pictures from the top of the memorial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chicagofran2
40,Beautiful Succulents !!,This was a mellow little walk down a path filled with some of the most beautiful vegetation I have seen. Yes this is a small collection but worth the small fee to see all the little wonders that Ms.Wrigley brought to the island. Mr.Wrigley's memorial is quite the resting place as well with a breath taking view. Thank you to Sue at the Post Office for recommending this lovely place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANTHONYD549
50,A wonderful nature walk!,"We enjoyed the information movies at the beginning of the walking path. We visited during the late afternoon, and loved walking through the gardens in the late sunshine. The Wrigley Memorial has a beautiful view and is a beautiful tribute to Mr. Wrigley! The ticket booth operator was very sweet and helpful. She let us know it was easier to walk up the left ramp to get up to the top - and funner to go down the steps on the left of the memorial when leaving. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB262
30,Beautiful Succulants,"This botanic garden consisted of mostly desert plants. They were beautiful. The hike uphill left us city dwellers out of breath, but the memorial had a breathtaking view of the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhittierTraveler
30,Be sure to visit,Interesting gardens - has various cacti and succulents. Also has an area of native plants which was interesting. The Wrigley Memorial was beautiful. Worth the walk for the views. Would put this on my list of things to visit on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlathemom
50,An interesting excursion,This is a good place that shows much of flora that is native to Catalina Island. It is always fun to walk up to the memorial and enjoy the extensive tile work and the distant view of the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danny38
40,Worth a visit,The memorial was lovely with all the tile work and the view was outstanding as long as you don't mind all the steps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderer31310
50,See the Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden.,You will see very unique cactus - and it's a great walk to get there. We took the 1.2 mile hike also - not too difficult but a good work out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryJoF155
50,"A beautiful, peaceful place","This is a walking tour and though not strenuous, is uphill on a dirt road. The gardens are lovely, consisting mostly of desert type plants, cactus, succulents, etc. The memorial is so beautiful with lovely tilework and a beautiful view. The admission price is reasonable. $5 for seniors, I think. There is a city trolley that can take you there. The trolley is $4 round trip and you can hop on/hop off in several places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyrnaB362
30,Cacti are worth seeing,November is probably not the time to visit the garden. The cacti part of the garden was very interesting to walk around. The memorial has an ocean view and has lovely Catalina tiles in an Art Deco setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beverlz
50,So beautiful!,This was a very interesting garden. When we went to Catalina Island we had no idea that there was a connection to Mr. Wriggly. But after visiting the memorial we knew the history and were able to see all of the wonderful unique plant Mrs. Wriggly planted. I have to say I didn't expect to see so many beautiful cactus on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoniqueS147
20,Not that impressed,"Walking to the garden, i was disappointed by not been surrounded by beautifull colors and cleaness.I didn't find it ""all that"" maybe becouse i was compering the garden to Balboa garden in San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/john872
40,Nice place to spend an hour or so,"Took the bus from town to the garden ($4 per person, roundtrip) and walked around for an hour. The gardens are interesting, views from the memorial are cool and the info movies were decent. Active duty military and their families get in free, so that was a bonus for us.There is a hiking trail that leads up the mountain from the memorial. Otherwise, an hour is plenty to check out everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brolls286
20,Not so impressive,"The structure was impressive, however, the gatekeeper selling tickets was an unfriendly woman who acted as if she hates her job and the public. The featured plants identify which grow on the island but nothing impressive - I spent less than 15 minutes at the attraction for a $7 fee. Dirt paths - not very comfortable to have pebbles and dirt in your sandals so I recommend walking shoes. No trolley on weekdays in October, so plan on walking 1.5 miles - it was a nice walk on a hot summer day. You'll pass a campground, golf course, and fire department on your way back toward town. Other than pictures of the structure, this wasn't worth what the cost or even the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/109MelissaB
50,Wirgley Memorial is beautiful,The walk from town to the Memorial(about a mile and a half) is mostly uphill so do it only if you enjoy walking. But the walk is worth it. The Botanical Gardens and the Memorial itself are breathtaking. Go early in the day so fewer people will be there. It is a peaceful place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaBElPaso
50,A Nice Break from Town,A walk through the Botanical Garden and visit to the Wrigley Memorial was a nice break from the bustle of Avalon. The view from the top of the memorial is beautiful and very peaceful. Signage of the plants in the garden is well done and the introduction videos are very informative. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmmbirdpat
30,Good for exercise,There are a lot of desert plants here but our favorite is always Wrigley's memorial- the walk is up hill so take your time walking and walk to the left and go up those steps as the steps are larger and fewer and easier to get up to the memorial - if you need more exercise take the steps on the right - they say there a few hundred steps....check out where Wrigley and his family were going to be entombed until WWII came along and they changed their mind and are using Forest Lawn instead. the tile is original and beautiful as is the blue stones you walk on...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazingmary
30,Kind a boring...,"It is what it is, just plants and a brief history of the garden. The memorial building is nice but they should add written history inside that and get the front fountain working to give it a place of arrival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadCuban
40,wrigley gardens,"absolutley beautiful, definitely confirms that catalina is a desert island. Delighted to find all of the indigenous plants there to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683juliec683
50,The flora and fauna history of Catalina Island,A great experience and about a mile and a half walk up from the beach. Examples of the vegetation unique to Catalina and marvelous place for a casual stroll. I first remembered it as the Catalina Marathon in March runs down the main service road thru the botanic garden giving one a glimpse. Not much of a glimpse as it is at the 25 mile point!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phineasfogg25
30,No accomodation,"The day was very warm. The woman at the front tried to assist us, but the lady at the desk behind her had no customer service skills and kept answering questions. One of our party had mobility issues, they said they didn't have wheelchairs or alternate access. That was fine, but then one in the party asked if they could store our bag of non valuables so they could assist the one needed assistance up the hill. The mean lady barked, ""We don't have enough room in here as it is."" A quick glance proved her wrong and she could have won big in customer service points for assisting a guest. We won't recommend this site to friends even though the view was fabulous. There were no storage lockers, either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraMS_12
30,Neat place to visit,The Wrigle Memorial and Botanical Garden was neat to visit but kind of expensive for what you get - a self walking tour of cacti and a big stone building. We were with a 7 year old who was not impressed. More for folks who enjoy plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinkerelle
50,Mostly cactus.,The botanicals are mostly varieties of cactus and not flowers. The Wrigley memorial is interesting—built on a spectacular scale with interesting details. The best way up is the trolley from downtown Avalon. It comes back every hour and one hour is just about right for this site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrismaticCalifornia
40,For those that enjoy plants.,This place was definitely not what I expected but it was fun. You could see all the plants that were native to Catalina. The memorial is gorgeous and the view is nice too. I would recommend heading over if you have time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToriY
50,Worth the trec,The Memorial is a bit of a hike slightly uphill from the garden but well worth it if you are able to do it. The views from the top of the memorial are breathtaking as well as the memorial itself built in the 1930's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackier208
50,I survived the hike!,"Beautiful gardens. I half biked, half hiked the ""intermediate"" climb. I was exhausted byt he time I reached the top. For a minimal fee ($8), this stop is worth seeing. Better yet, active Military their family gets in free, which I thought was really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiseMarie
40,we enjoyed this walk,"It's a pleasant walk from the center of Avalon to the Wrigley Memorial. There is a small nature center on the way, where you can stop and find out interesting facts about the wildlife on the island. Another reviewer thought the admission price was too high, but students get a discounted price of $3, so our family of 4 paid $20 which I think was reasonable. We enjoyed the variety of desert plants in the garden. The memorial is covered in beautiful Catalina tiles and there is a lovely view from the top. If you aren't much for walking there is a regularly scheduled trolley that takes you to/from the memorial for $2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraC214
40,a great walk with an amazing view,"I learned so much walking up and down the garden. I wish the water was still running through it, it would be so beautiful. From the garden you can see a splendid view of the ocean too. And then just wait to climb up to Wrigley memorial. The tiles are so exquisite and it makes for great pictures. Definitely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1ssy
50,Wonderful native plants / Nice walk from town,"The Botanic Garden is beautifully-maintained and features many interesting plants. William Wrigley, Jr.'s Memorial is rather moving, if you consider that he was originally buried there after some 13 years' work developing Catalina Island. A guide told me that the Wrigley family moved his remains to Chicago during WWII, concerned about possible loss if Pacific raids took place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorCalDreamer
30,"Hot, dry, uphill climb to see the memorial for Wrigley. Once up there, the view was spectacular and well worth the hike",The view from inside the memorial was great. One could see all of the harbor. Only thing is that neither of the Wrigleys are not there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyclemom1
40,Keep an Eye out for Wildlife,We were late in the day. We walked from downtown. On the way we spotted red headed black woodpeckers working over palm trees. Interestingly they were pecking holes to store acorns. The trees were full of them. We toured the gardens and memorial and were about the only people left. We happened on one of the Catalina Island foxes which was checking to see if anybody might have left any fox chow under a bench. We also spotted two deer on the wall of the canyon just outside the fence.The gardens are small but they have two theme areas that are nice. One features cacti. The other various plants that are red.Worth a visit just to get out of the noise of golf carts and actually hear the breeze. The memorial is art deco inspired (like the casino) and a fun to visit but don't have to visit spot.$7 but given the price of everything else in town that's pretty cheap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FromVegas
40,Beautiful View,"This is a mild hike up to the Memorial and well worth the view. It's worth taking it a little farther up (a little over 1 mile) along the Garden to Sky Hike. Moderately challenging, but pick a day not too hot. The view is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJL414
30,Nice View,It's a long hike or bike ride (we rode) to the top but a nice view form the mausoleum and the tile work and full on bronze door are pretty cool. If you're looking for something to do it's a nice walk but I didn't pay any attention to any of the plants (nothing real special).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_Pickle
40,Refreshing place to visit,If you are a plant and flower lover and enjoy walking the outdoors than this is your spot on the Island to visit. The top of the memorial is approx 125 flight of stairs; but once your up top the view is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheresaZ_11
50,"Even if you're not a desert plant person, worth the hike","I've visited the Wrigly Memorial a few times in my trips to Catalina, and each time, I've learned a bit more about the indigeous desert plants that populate California. The Memorial itself is a beautiful structure, and when you climb the stairs to look back down the canyon to the ocean, it's a picture-perfect perch. The hike up and down to the Memorial area takes you by the country club, the horse stables, and the golf course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craiggerman
30,nice stop but not worth the price,"$7 per person, for a short walk to the memorial, which ispretty cool but not really worth the price, could have missedit and not been disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinF600
50,nice!!,so many cool plants and awesome buildings!!!! defintly a must see at least once!! not badly priced either,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megank593
30,not worth the 7 bucks charge,"it is a cool place, the monument is the wall of china, its cool, but stiff on price for what you get. You have to get the bus to get there, it is a hike. The garden itself is ok but nothing i havent seen before, loth of cactus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earner2
40,Worth a ride on the trolley,"We wended our way through the Island to get to Mr. Wrigley's memorial and cactus garden. Whole thing was very interesting although I think the desert museums in Phoenix and Tucson probably have better plants. Wrigley is reponsible for the development of this little slice of paradise, so why not a rather showy memorial?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanbeach11
40,Cool walk and beautiful Catalina Tile,"Take the Red Trolley tram and hop off at the Botanic Garden. It is worth the little admission fee. The view is amazing from the top of the Memorial. It is a walk though. The tile is amazing and beautiful. I definently advise going there especially on the trolley, it is a cheap way to see the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstiffanygirl
30,Cool Cactus,"Even if you don't think you like cactus, you will gain a new appreciation for the species after you visit this place. Beautiful memorial and lovely cactus garden. Nice views, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kskags
30,Interesting history of the Wrigleys...,Well preserved cacti garden...the memorial was architecturally interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoLM_58
30,not for people who are orthopedically challenged,"like thousands of others, we rented a golf cart to tour the island. I have knee problems so walking is an issue... the distance/heat of the day/and incline from the entrance to the top of Wrigley Memorial is a challenge for people with orthopedic issues. Once at the top, I can't say that it was worth the hike. Glad that I went just to say that I saw it but I wish someone had told me that I wouldn't have been missing much if I bypassed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynne4078
50,Peaceful and Historic,"This garden has native and imported planst - well maintained. Spots to sit, reflect, and enjoy the crisp clean air. The Wrigley Memorial provides a lovely view and exquisite tile art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginnyd6323
40,Nice change of pace,"Not crowded. Take the trolley up and enjoy the ride. If you like cacti, the botanical garden boasts many varietals. The memorial is very nice, and has beautiful views. Hiking trails are inside as well. Worth it if you're hiking. Might seem a bit pricey if you're just looking @ the memorial and garden area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N00dleW
50,very good waste of time for $7,"It's cheap to get in, don't do the tours, just take the $2 city bus to the end of the line, pay $7 at the gate, and walk around slowly at your own pace, the tours are a ripoff. Bring water bottles and sunscreen too, your gonna need it. And when you get to the fork in the road, that path loops around so it doesn't matter anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlmightySverk
50,Wrigley Must See,"Just a great place to walk through, with all the exoctic plants, cacti, and trees. To top it off you can climb the over 100 stairs to the top of Wrigley Memorial for a view of beauty. You can see all the way to the Pacific and even the cruise ship that was in. The whole garden has a serene feel to it and would be a great place to just spend time reading or walking to see all the plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16lob
30,Botanical Garden,We took the $4 round-trip tram up to the garden. Garden admission was $7. The garden featured cacti and native island plants. It was interesting and pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurieSanClemente_Ca
40,Don't miss it,"The tower is lovely and historic and tells part of the story of the island and it's benefactor. The gardens are lovely and make you aware of the natural flora of the island. The views are spectacular. Just a short but uphill hike from town, if you would like a fabulous hike take the Hourbtrail on the way back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saysomething123
30,Watch out for George!,"""Watch out for George!"" That is now a running joke in my family, as we did encounter a somewhat unpleasant gentleman (um...I use that word loosely) on our visit.Right before the entrance of the gardens, there were some beautiful, tall, papery looking flowers growing alongside the road. My son stopped and was taking a macro photo of a flower (not touching/picking/harassing) and a man yelled, rudely and loudly, ""Do NOT mess with the flowers! It's illegal!"" Niiiiiice. Come to find out, the gentleman (again...loose term) is somehow affiliated with the place, although I'm not sure of his job title. Visitor Discourager? Disgruntled Botanist? Ultimate Lord and Protector of All Living Things? His behavior was uncalled for and I did not appreciate it. Despite his rudeness, I took a deep breath, surveyed the beauty around me, paid a fee, and entered the Botanic Garden.Right past the entrance, there is a peaceful area to sit and watch a variety of videos related to Catalina's plants and animals. You then meander through the garden paths at your own pace. There are many desert plants and succulents, and everything is well-labeled. As you continue on, you will eventually get to the Wrigley Memorial, which is really just a huge structure, but it is interesting, with lots of Catalina tile and gorgeous views from the top. On a side note, if someone stomps up the stairs while you stay at the bottom, you can hear this cool echo-y boingy noise. I'm not sure why, but we enjoyed that funky noise.The Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Garden was nice. I'm not sure if it was worth the price, but then again, we didn't have a very warm welcome, so maybe our initial encounter put a slight damper on our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandGirl67
30,Too expensive,"great view, good place to go if you've run out of stuff to do. it was pricey, however, and the memorial is pompous, for such an interesting, yet unremarkable figure in history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateH128
40,KILLER view!,"This was a nice stop on our golf cart tour around Catalina. We were able to stretch our legs and check our the gorgeous gardens. The view from the monument is totally worth the climb! Just be sure you bring a bottled water and prepare for it to be warmer than the shore line, even on a cool day. That sun gets hot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlyndd
40,Lovely garden and Majestic Memorial,"We were in Catalina for just a day, so we rented a golf cart and drove up to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens. The entry fee was $7, which at first ,seemed a bit high, but the place is so pretty and the restrooms nicely kept, I didn't mind. The hike through the gardens, up to the memorial is short and pleasant. Once you arrive at the monument, there are a number of steps up, it was easy for us, but might be difficult with someone with mobility issues. The view from the top is lovely and the memorial itself reminds me of a fortress in a Maxfield Parrish print.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohriorio
50,Nice Hike!,"We had an enjoyable morning here; we rented a golf cart to drive to the Gardens and then hiked up to the Memorial, which is gorgeous. There are stairs to one side or a sloped walk way on the other. There are stairs inside. The doors lead into an area where there is Blue Flagstone which was brought from the other side of the island and is gorgeous! It was a treat to see - also many tiles from the Catalina Tile company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoLi2269

It's uphill all the way there, so it's a nice downhill walk all the way back after you've exhausted yourself.

40,Good experience,Didn't walk through the gardens because of the swarms of bees but did walk up to the memorial which was a great place to take pictures and view the gardens from above. Went on the hike from the gardens which was only mildly challenging and did not take toolong. The walk to the memorial is doable but is at least 25 minutes. If you can hitch a ride if the trolley is not running.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarciL_11

50,"Do Not miss this one If your in Avalon, catalina island !","The memorial and botanical garden is very nice, and you can reach this place With a short hike between 30-45 mins. Depending on your pace. The garden is full of dessert plants and varieties of cactus. The memorial is overlooking the ocean in the north and the view is amazing, i think i took a lot photos in here. The Wrigley memorial is just like impossible to build in the 1930's, But It survives until now. The fee is minimal, i will be back to check this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renatol349
40,Interesting,The gardens were very relaxing and as baseball fans the history behind the memorial was of great interest to us. The memorial itself was a masterpiece and I loved the beautiful tiles as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieJanEtte
30,Paid just to hike,"We paid just to hike and loved the plants but thought the 7 dollar fee per person was a bit steep. Also the lady at the counter was not very polite. This may have been due to the cruise ship arrival that day, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaLOxnard_CA
40,long but rewarding walk,"it took us almost 45 min to walk up to the memorial from the beach, but it was a lovely walk and the memorial is really gorgeous with great tilework.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brigid_bliss
40,The artwork is worth the climb,"The memorial is a small structure, with fabulous tilework and granite designs. The views are spectacular out to the ocean. The town is just below the treeline, so you have the feeling of being on an uninhabited island. Just below the memorial stretches a nice, but not extravagant botanical garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgrambois
50,"A bit out of the way, but worth it!","This is something we did not plan on doing, but glad we did. One of our tours fell through so we had a little extra time on our hands. It was a Sat morning and we heard that the red shuttle operates on the weekends. Instead of taking a taxi, renting a golf cart or walking we took the shuttle. It was $2 per person and about a 20 minute ride to the gardens. It was nice to drive around town and see some of the neat houses, etc. The gardens were beautiful and great views of the ocean from the top of the memorial. The memorial itself was amazing. Very intricate and worth walking up the hill to see. We spent about 1.5 hours walking around. When we were done we picked up the shuttle again which stops every hour outside the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kim197140
40,Hiker's Delight,"The Wrigley Botanic Gardens were an educational experience from the Education and Display Center with an excellent video presentation located just inside the garden entrance. Next we walk through the cactus and succulent areas. Most of the plants are identified and delineated for the lay person to understand the origin of the plants. Many plants are indigenous to Catalina Island and nowhere else in the world. Walking our way through the California island endemics we arrive at the base of the Wrigley Memorial. Avid hikers can then follow the path to the ""Garden to the Sky"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneS111
40,View!,Leave a donation and stroll the grounds. Loved looking at the variety of plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddW247
40,A Nice Walk with Great Views,"It only took 40 years and about a dozen visits to finally get to the Wrigley Memorial & Botanic Garden. Had I known what a treat it would be, I might have gone sooner.My husband and I enjoyed the mile-and-a-half walk up the road, which wound through a quiet yet still populated part of the island, past the golf course and school.At the top are the gardens and memorial. It cost $7 a person to get in, and it was worth this nominal price.I have seen better and more elaborate gardens. These were soley cactus gardens, so they provided little variety in the species represented. And the gardens certainly were not the lush type of grounds you might associate with the word ""gardens.""But the cacti displays seemed apprropriate for the island, and in fact showcased many plants endemic to Catalina. All were nicely labeled, and we found ourselves pointing out the species we first saw in the gardens later as we walked through town.But the real highlight was the memorial, located on the side of a hill at the top of the gardens' grounds. It is a grand place, with concrete tiled stairs and archways leading to an observation area, where stupendous views of the canyon and ocean unfold.Part Hearst Castle and part church, the memorial was both austere and majestic, symetrical in its design and natural in its setting.Also impressive was how we had the place almost entirely to ourselves. One couple descended the stairs as we went up, and another couple seemed to wait for us to come down before heading up themselves.The gardens and memorial were highlights of our Catalina visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allys0nR
40,Go for a walk,"A nice garden exhibiting the flora of the island, and the memorial has a nice old California feel to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TessaB16
50,Beautiful!,We love the Botanical Gardens....it's just beautiful. You have to see it though...don't take my word for it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracidhb
40,We also walked to the Memorial and Botanical Garden from town.,It was an easy walk from town up a gradual incline and it was only $5 dollars (senior) to get into the gardens and memorial site. The structure is amazingly large and there are many exotic plants. We found it to be very interesting and enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buzybee321
30,Small but charming,"A lovely walk from town. The garden is small but has all the endemic plants of Catalina Island. We hiked the trail to the peak, which round trip took about 2.5 hrs starting at the camp area before the gardens. The hike was the highlight of our stay on the island. Beautiful vistas to both sides of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VTtraveler_72
40,"Simple, quiet.","A pleasant 1.75 mile from Avalon harbor upvalley brings one to this sedate collection of southern-California plants and imposing memorial to Catalina's founder, William Wrigley. Don't expect a cafe or any amenities -- it's just for walking around and quiet enjoyment. The beautiful handmade tiles at the memorial are unique (made on island at a now-closed factory) and the view of the harbor and hills is great. The starting point for a fine hike to the top of the mountains (Garden to the Sky trail) that's worth it for exercise, solitude, and views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Decano22
30,View is worth it,"If you're not going to hike, the memorial will be your best views. Check out the endemic plants. Kinda neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnkelBuck
30,kind of boring,not much too it but a lot of dead looking plants and the building seems like a huge waste of resources. wouldn't recommend it but it was cheap because we had a buy one get one free. wouldn't pay full admission for 2 people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OscarIris
30,Good little side excursion,"Okay, I'm not a tree or bush fan so yeah, it was somewhat interesting anyway, but the fun part was actually the golf cart trip up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/San-Diego-Surf-n-Sun
50,Great Plants !,"How cool, not into plants at all but this was pretty neat !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atollmedic
40,great view,"I'm not much for botanical gardens, but my friend and I rented a golf cart and headed up to the gardens to see the Wrigley memorial. I climbed all the way to the top. Lots of info there about what Wrigley and his wife did for the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldmotherhubbardx3
30,If you've got time...,"Memorial gardens to honor Wrigley chewing gum founder, William Wrigley, Jr. There is an admission fee to enter and view the desert plants and memorial. You'll get a great view from the top of the monument. A peaceful escape from town, beautifully tiled architecture, interesting cacti... worth a trip if you've got time. It's an easy trolley ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DellaJo
40,Walking tour,"Pleasant two hours, it is hilly so walking is not on flat ground. Plants well marked. Some good photo ops. Dramatic structure at highest point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaskanArctic
40,entertainment,it was very clean.. clerk at window not to nice... very small for a price of $7.00 each!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattid502
50,Just beautiful,Liked it but was disappointed the mansion was no longer open!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaB540
50,Great Hike,"The memorial is worth seeing - great architecture and tiling work, but the gardens themselves are quite small. Its $7 entrance which isn't really worth it as far as the size of the gardens, BUT we hiked the ""sky-line trail"" which you access via the gardens just past the memorial. The hike is steep, but easy on the feet (fire-road) and gives fantastic views of Avalon and the surrounding canyons. Go to the very top, you'll be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamSelz
50,nice walk,wonderful walk throughout the gardens and memorial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StanG485
40,Unique collection of cacti and succulents,"This is one of the destinations you might like to visit when you rent a golf cart for a self-guided tour of the island. There is a fascinating collection of cactus and succulent type plants, many of which you might not see elsewhere. The walk up to the monument is mildly challenging, but once up there, you will have commanding view of the ocean and coastline. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lightseeker001
40,Worth the $7,"We took the 2 mile (good exercise) walk from the ocean up to the botanical garden and the Wrigley Memorial and it was a great walk and work the $7/person to walk through the gardens, watch the videos about it all and get to climb inside what once was Wrigley's tomb memorial....very cool! AWESOME view of Avalon facing the water surrounded by mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brnidmel
40,Very Impressive,Spent several hours just walking and looking at all the wonders in the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thermal2
40,impressive memorial worth the walk,The walk from the beach takes about 45 minutes on a paved road which is shared by golf carts and the rare car. There are some sections that have sidewalk but not all the way. it is a pleasant walk and then you arrive at the gardens first which you can stroll through and then reach the memorial. You do need to pay to enter the grounds of both the gardens and the memorial. I was last there about 20 years ago and it was free then. We paid and liked looking at the assortment of cacti and there were some great photo ops at the base of the memorial looking up and at the view from the top. My daughter counted 100 steps to get to the top of the memorial. We then took the one mile hike straight up hill to the view point where you can see both sides of the island. That is a real hike and not easy but if you like that sort of thing it is worth it. The entrance to the trail is to the right of the memorial if you are facing it. There is a gate that looks closed but you can open it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadler
50,The Wrigley Memorial,A nice relaxing walk while viewing of the garden. Best view is at the top of the memorial. Great place to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Enoch
40,Amazing,"When I hear the word Botanical Garden, I think of flowers and lots of them but instead there were cactus's. The Memorial was amazing, the beautiful tile work that was inlaid is incredible. The gardens are very nice, lots of different cactus's and other plants nicely displayed throughout. My family hiked from town and it was a good walk to the Memorial and back. Stopped at the Sandtrap for lunch and it was nice to rest the feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StraightBlue2
40,"Great walk, interesting plants",great couple of hours. Loved the cactus and succulent garden. The memorial was very cool also. You can also take the trolly there and back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WishIwasthere17
40,It's a Must-See,Strolled 30 minutes to find this gem. Relaxing. Beautiful Architecture. Interesting garden to say the least. We stayed for over an hour enjoying every corner. It's a Must-See on Catalina.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotYourAvgBlonde
30,Nice Walk,"We like to walk, rather than hike, and having exhausted the limited possibilities of wandering around Avalon we set off for the Wrigley Memorial on our second morning. It's an easy, slightly uphill stroll of about a mile and a half from the harbor and is shown on all the maps (once you start up Avalon Canyon Road, keep left, basically). Opposite the golf course there is a little cafe/restaurant, the Sandtrap, which is worth a stop for a leisurely drink or a meal. The Catalina Conservancy building a little further on has very civilized washrooms!The Memorial itself is undistinguished but there is a good view from the top (about 100 steps up). The botanical gardens are not exactly thrilling, but everything is labeled and they do have all the Catalina endemics.Having inquired at the Conservancy about easy hikes we'd been told that there was only one, so we did that. You go to the right of the memorial, through the gate in the wire fence. After about 1 1/2 miles you get to the top of the ridge and can see both sides of the island. More ambitious hikers set off along the ridge on Divide Road (we oldies just came back down again!). In theory you need a permit from the Conservancy to do this hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWMildcat
30,Not something I would go see twice,It was a nice walk with my wife to the look at point within the park but overall it was pretty boring and not worth the cost of admission. While there is not a whole lot to do in Catalina (unless your a scuba diver) there are better things to spend your time doing then spending more than an hour at this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElitePhx
40,A neat experience for adults,"Children will be bored out of their minds, but the peaceful tranquility found here along with the interesting cacti and trees are an enjoyable getaway from the Avalon hustle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FinallyABreak
30,Garden was not good,"the garden was not exciting, but i thougnt the memorial was amazing. the walk thru the garden was worth the view of the sea. But when i was in the gardens i saw a heart shaped catctus, i guess that was fun. the memorial is huge and beautiful. visited June 2011",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolyaypotatoes
40,Great way to start the day in Avalon - pretty views and a nice walk,"I arrived in Avalon on the Catalina Express from Dana Point. I decided I would start my visit walking up to the Memorial and Gardens. It is about a 2 mile walk (it took me about 30 minutes to get there from the docks) that is slightly uphill the entire way.It was a typical June gloom kind of morning with overcast skies and a little drizzle which made the walk comfortable. You pass a golf course and the Nature Center on your way.I saw a lot of people on golf carts heading up to the gardens along the way.There is a $5 fee to enter the Botanical Gardens which highlight the plantlife found on Catalina which is mainly cactus, ironwood trees, and some blossoming bushes. As you walk up through the canyon you reach the Wrigley Memorial which stands tall over the area.The memorial is simple and poignant. You can walk up to the top and you get a wonderful view of the canyon leading back to Avalon.The walk back to town was easier since it was down hill the whole way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ct-cruisers
40,rent a golf cart to get to the monument parking.,"We rented a golf cart to get around the island in our limited time. It was efficient and fun. We enjoyed seeing the vegetation. The view from the monument was gorgeous. It was a misty, foggy day....so pretty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytravelers97
30,"The garden wasn't that great, but the view beyond the memorial was great!","The garden itself wasn't that interesting, but the memorial was worth the price of admission. Also, beyond the memorial you can hike a mile further into the hills and see an amazing view of both sides of the island. Note- the hike is up hill so be prepared. The views are worth the effort tho.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/021
50,The views from the Memorial are breathtaking,Worth the walk. Take your time & enjoy all the beauty. From the top of the Memorial you'll be rewarded with a truly spectacular view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraK2
50,Fantastic Garden,"Disclaimer: If you're not into gardens or walking, this is not for you.This is a beautiful garden. It has a fantastic collection of desert plants, including enormous, very old cactii. I think the cactus garden rivals the one at the Huntington Library. The memorial is also interesting, but the garden was the really pleasant surprise for me.If you enjoy hiking, then a great thing to do is to come into the botantical gardens the back way--at the end of a loop trail that begins with the Hermit Gulch Trail. This trail branches off to the right of the main road (just after the camp grounds that are on the main road leading up to the memorial). The hike is about 2-3 hours and is beautiful. You can get more detailed hiking instructions from the conservancy office in town. A bonus is that the botanical gardens are free if you come in through the back way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaTye
50,"Great Views on the way up, and at the Memorial","My husband and I stayed in Catalina in September of 2007, and visited again for the day while on a Catalina/Ensenada cruise, in October of 2008. On both visits, we walked up from the Avalon harbor, past the golf course, and into Hermit Gulch Campgrounds on the right, and hiked up to the top. Hermit Gulch is where we hit the top, it depends what trail you take and which way you go up. I guess most people enter the Botanical Gardens and make it to the Wrigley Memorial by entering (and paying the nominal fee) at the entrance to the gardens...but if you hike up from the other side (starting at a trail that begins inside the Hermit Gulch Campground), you hit the top with some spectacular views, then you come down through the Memorial, then the gardens, and bypass the entry fee. We don't really go this way to skip the fee, it's just a few dollars...we go this way because the hike up from the trail inside the campground is a good, long one, and then you get to end the whole thing with a trip through the botanical gardens, and the Wrigley memorial, instead of starting there and then having to hike up and down a long hiking trail. We'd rather do that part first.If you don't like hiking or nature, this is not for you. But the payoff at the top is worth every step! We actually got engaged on the first visit, at the top of the hill, with views of the mainland, Avalon harbor, and the Channel Islands. Amazing.We are going back in 2 weeks for our 1st wedding anniversary, and this hike is definitely on our list of things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allens08
30,Boring,"This was so boring! Its a long walk, so if you like to walk then its great. The garden is like walking thru a desert. The only lovely thing is that at the end theres a lovely building.... huge with a lovely view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericaberryy
50,Beautiful Garden!,"My husband and I went to Catalina Island for our honeymoon in March. One of our favorite things on the island was the journey through the Botanical Garden! It was gorgeous, and the variety of plants and trees was breathtaking! We took lots of pictures, and plan to go back again, maybe for our 5th anniversary, and see if anything new has been added to the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nasarow
