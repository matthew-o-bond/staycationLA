40,Noisy but beautiful I would rate good but there isn‚Äôt that option,"This beach is right by the airport runway so you‚Äôve got tons of planes taking off over your head but I found it to be an interesting and unusual photographic opportunity. The beach itself is really lovely, you can spend a good hour walking and enjoying the view. And the sunsets ???? Amazing ! Free public parking at several access points. Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurydice2017
50,Lovely evening,"Parking was $9 and then we had access to beach and fire pits to enjoy the sunset and evening ocean air. Bring your own wood, recommend beach chairs and blankets as it gets chilly. They allow alcohol on the beach. Felt safe and enjoyable parking lot is lit and there were periodic patrols.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610charj
40,Great Place to visit after a long day.,"This is a really nice beach with plenty of parking, bicycle paths, fire pits, lifeguards, and a gift shop on site. Although you have to pay to park, it's relatively inexpensive. Whenever I'm in LA and have an early flight the next day, I always head down to this beach. It's close to the airport and the hotels near the airport. It's great for a nice walk, swimming and also great for families. This beach is clean and trouble-free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter_A_Morrell
50,Beautiful Beach üèñ,"It was a beautiful beach, sand was clean and soft. I did not even see seaweed. The RV park has 3 rows and full hook-ups and a grill is provided. The bathroom was clean, the showers had very warm water and great water pressure. The only downfall is the fact it is so close to the airport. I had earplugs but they were still loud for me and my husband but my children did not seem to notice and they range from 1year to 13 years. The second day I slept fine, I do not know if it was because i was so tired or i got used to the noise. I have a decibel app and I recorded one of the airplanes and it rated at 72dbs which is as loud as a vacuum. The staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smunoz_1999
50,Great Beach,"Great Beach ... but all of the California beaches are nice. Plenty of parking in the various State-run parking lots. Not many amenities in the area as the beach is adjacent to an oil refinery, a water treatment planty, and a butterfly reserve. But, you're there for the beach and the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
50,Clean! Open area w lifeguards!,This is a great beach with nearby parking and playground for kids and plenty of beach for kids to roam and play in the surf.

40,"Noisy but Nice for Sunsets, Biking, and Beach Parties","The beach is located under the airport flight Take-off Path, therefore noisy, but it offers Nice Sunsets, ample space for Beach Parties, and a Bike Path on the beach that extends from Playa Del Rey to Redondo Beach. It offers a large Parking Lot and is popular with locals on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerCritic
40,"Family friendly, non-touristy beach that allows bonfires, downside is airplane noise","Dockweilier State Beach is located just west of LAX and is a large stretch of coast, that is away from the more commercial /touristy piers of Redondo, Medonda and Hermosa beach towns. This means that it is usually less crowded and it's to find a spot to picnic and put up a tent. The noise from the airplanes flying overhead every 5 minutes can be a tad annoying. But on the plus side this is one of those beaches that provide bonfire pits!We often go there on weekends to chill and have fun as a family!Again, this is a nice place to go if you are living in the LA area. If you are a tourist, then you may find this place a little dull!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadesofwords
30,LAX plane noise,"It was cloudy all day (April) so no crowds. Parking $5 on this day. There are fire pits. Negatives..no food or drink for a LONG way. Didn't look for toilets so I don't know.

50,March on an overcast day,"This is the second time I have been in LA this year and was dying to get to the Pacific. The day was overcast, windy and 60's. We took a 10 minute Lyft from the Airport Marriott. The beach was empty except for a few bikers along the path. (Wished I had a bike to ride there.) They use big machinery to grade the beach and one of these was at work while we were there. We walked along the shoreline and watched birds peck at the surf line, got wet up to our knees, played tag with the waves and drew in the sand. All in all spent about 1.5 hours, which was all we had. What a wonderful experience. I will definitely go back to this or another beach when I am in the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wildflower01945
40,Jets and ocean waves,"This is a very nice beach. Not too many tourists at this location. The beach was located near LAX so it is a plane watching paradise as well. The facilities were well maintained and the parking was plentiful, $3 all day. Cheapest beach parking of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stcharlesmayor
30,almost great if you don't mind the noise,"The facilities are good, bathrooms, parking, snack bar, bike path. The beach is nicely maintained, and it has plenty of trash cans, so there is no excuse to litter. The problem was the noise.

Free on weekdays, and $4 to park on weekends, this beach was clean, had soft white sand, big area, wasn‚Äôt crowded, and had the perfect surf to hang out in all day!

30,Big beach - dirty sand,"First of all, I have never been to a CA beach, only MI ones. That's the only comparison I can make. I thought the sand was quite dirty, my feet were filthy by the end of the day. I don't know if there are different parts of the beach or what, but the area I was at had several different setups around us having stereo wars.The airplanes flying overhead were a little jarring, but I guess everyone there is used to it. The bathrooms were something else. They were dirty and lucky for me, I was told to bring my own TP because there wasn't any. All that being said, the weather was perfect, great breeze off the ocean, the water was warm enough to swim in (if you are from MI). I can see why it is so popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nacho67

20,"Ok in Winter, Stay Away in Summer - No Street Parking","This is a pleasant enough beach in the winter, when you probably don't care about going to the beach. In summer it is super, super crowded, with people, tents, pop-up canopies and BBQ's. Parking is no longer permitted on the street above the beach (Vista del Mar) so you must use the paid parking lots, and traffic entering the single-entrance to the parking can back up on Imperial Highway to beyond Pershing. The beach experience is loud, with competing sound systems blaring all around, and people have been know to bring in pallets to burn in the fire rings. The bike path is not really safe as there are oblivious people using it as a walk path. For a more pleasant beach experience try Playa del Rey to the immediate north or Hermosa, or any of the other South Bay beaches to the south. Even Santa Monica is a better choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAWH77

Parking was about $10 for the day, so we thought that quite reasonable. You are NOT allowed to stay overnight, we asked! It's very clean, bins everywhere, and seems to be a real quiet spot in January. We would like to stop at the Dockweiler RV Park, but sadly it's not open in the Winter months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RescuedVegan

50,Dockweiler State Beach,"I like going to that beach, as I can park my park on the side of the street for free (just watch out for the red markings, where you're not supposed to park). The other nice thing is, that it is right by the LAX runway and you're able to watch planes flyby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robvandam147
10,Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!,"I had been wanting to bonfire at Dockweiler for a few years. I live in Long Beach and typically spend time at Seal, Bolsa Chica, and Huntington Beach, I arrived early on a Saturday to grab a fire pit so we could bonfire later in the evening and I could not believe how much trash was left on the beach from the night before. It was shocking! There was a big crew of workers there early in the morning to clean up and they had the tractors on the sand scooping up trash as well. It seems as if most crowds on this beach party there all day and leave their trash all over when they leave. There are lots of locals from surrounding neighborhoods that occupy this beach and most people are not considerate of who is around them. Many groups bring big speaker systems and blast their music for everyone to hear (whether you want to hear it or not) and the whole beach reeked of marijuana. There were at least three groups around us that dug out their own fire pits in the sand and started a bonfire. The crowds and groups are loud and inconsiderate and there to party all day. This beach is dirty, the sand leaves your feet black, and it's a little scary later in the day. I will never attend this beach again and I do not recommend this beach for visitors and families. You are better off traveling a little further up the road and hitting up Redondo or Hermosa beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterloaiza

There is a bicycle/jogging/roller-blading path and at the main entrance there is a rental facility and snack bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
20,Dockweiler Beach,I visited this beach two times. If you get there early morning you can find free street parking easy but if you come later you will have to pay for parking in their lots. I love the environment and try to visit different beaches and what I noticed about this beach is that people do not pick up after themselves. There was garbage all over the place it was not pleasant. I tried to pick up some pieces of trash when I would leave the beach but there was just too much and some of the limited trash cans were full. I do think they need more trash cans as they only had them around the fire pits that were there. Unless people respect our beaches and take their trash with them there will always be a trash problem on our beaches. This beach is next to LAX so there is a huge noise problem but I love watching planes take off that I did enjoy watching them to include the huge jumbo jets fly over. I also noticed when I was laying on my beach towel getting some sun that there was a sewage smell close to the ground. As the day wore on it gets crowded that some people do not respect other people's spaces as kids do not watch were they are going and could end up kicking sand on people who are tanning themselves. The traffic situation can become horrible as it gets more crowded throughout the day. I would say this beach is not a top ten beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcjt01
20,Looks are deceiving,"We go to the Los Angeles area to visit family about every 2 years. In 2015, we went to Manhattan Beach near the pier. This time, we were going to the same place again, but drove by Dockweiler State Beach and thought it looked like a nice place to go. After paying for parking, we found a nice spot on the beach. However, after getting all set up, we realized that the water was full of garbage. Among the things we saw: sunglasses, a beanie hat, pens, plastic bags, at least 2 shirts and a pair of swim trunks along with some mylar balloons in the water, just name a few. No wonder it wasn't that crowded! The kids didn't like it because the trash kept brushing their legs along with a whole bunch of seaweed (maybe that could not be helped). And to top it all of, we all ended with various levels of beach tar on our skin (which maybe that can't be helped either). I guess we expected too much out of the facilities because only a couple of the outside showers worked and the bathrooms were pretty gross. We'll find a better place to go next time. Gave it a two rating because one of the people in our party did need help from a lifeguard and they did an awesome job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pescas
40,Great place for relaxed beach day,"After days of hectic touring and sight-seeing, we spent a relaxed afternoon at the Dockweiler State Beach... enjoying the ocean, waves, view, sand, sun, airplanes ascending & descending, and the cool breeze. What a much-needed break!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3cntrygrls
50,Stunning Ocean View,"I was in Los Angeles for business and decided to stop by one of my favorite spots before hopping on a plane to return back home. The spot was Dockweiler State Beach in the Play Del Rey community of Los Angeles, CA. The beach is a few miles from LAX. It is a quiet, family oriented beach. There are no vendors or attractions on this beach. The major attraction is the sand and amazing Pacific Ocean with stunning views of the water and mountain views off in a distance.Dockweiler State beach is the perfect place to have a picnic, bonfire or to take a stroll along the beach while sinking your toes in the wet sand. Or you might just want to lay out on a blanket and get a tan. There is a path for those who like to skate, ride a bike or walk/run/jog at this sweet nature spot. It is my perfect LA beach spot to go to in the morning to mediate and become one with nature. I personally find a big rock, sit down on it and let the sound of the ocean waves speak to my soul.Dockweiler State Beach is a picturesque view of California beach lifestyle. Visit and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifeisfree
40,"Great beach, not a tourist trap","I would say this more of a local's beach, I was taken by a friend who lives in LA. The big appeal of this beach for me is that its not overrun with tourists, its a bit calmer. The beach is clean, good parking available and some good waves for bodyboarding. Watching the planes fly over to LAX is fun too. Only downside would be the facilities, which i think are below par for a state beach where you to have pay for access. The restrooms and changing areas need an upgrade, only outside showers are available. These facilities are outdated and they need to spend some money on them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markclo1

40,Lovely,Great beach to have a bonfire. Can park on the street or in the lot. It's got really busy as we were on the weekend.

But still a wonderful time outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillwilliamsone
50,Favorite Beach Camping with Hook-ups,"Sadly, you can only stay 21 days at a stretch and only 60 days per year.The other downside is the noise on weekends and holidays.

Gorgeous views. Beachcombers dream. Bike path. Wonderful library. Near Wholefoods and Trader Joe's. Full Hook ups. Affordable. Lots of beach fire pits.

40,Tar seeps occur naturally here,"To Dale and others complaining about ""unacceptable"" tar seeps: these occur naturally along all SoCal beaches periodically. And they shift too so it's hard to predict where to stay away, but they're up and down the entire coast. In particular there is an ooze in SM close to the pier and along Dockweiler pretty far up from the parking lot‚Ä¶.can't remember the other locations but there are several of them.It's not surprising: we all know this is an oil-rich environment (think La Brea Tar Pits, Beverly Hillbillies, off-shore oil rigs). That stuff doesn't always stay nicely sequestered in rock awaiting a human straw to pull it out. Rock shifts, beaches erode, ""tar"" oozes.Just one of those icky things to accpet along with the good at the beach.It can be crowded on weekends, but walk away from parking lots to avoid crowds or drive further from ground zero (SM, Venice).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliris19
10,Grossest beach in So Cal,"I'm a 3rd generation native Angeleno and I've been going to So Cal beaches my entire life. This is by far the most disgusting beach I've ever visited. If you are lucky enough to get a $10 cash only parking spot, which does not always happen because they will sell you an entrance to the parking even if they're completely full, then you have to deal with all the awfulness of the beach itself. It's right beneath the LAX flight path so planes are constantly taking off overhead so not only do you get the noise but you'll also get the jet fuel fumes. After a few hours you may physically feel ill. The beach is also really crowded and covered in trash. People would just up and walk away from their little camp spots and leave all their trash right where it was. It was like the episode of MadMen where the Drappers just left all their garbage at the park. They literally just got up and walked away. Of course, that attracts animals too so there are tons sea birds also trying to swoop on your stuff. If people do happen to pack up their trash the bins overflow so there are mounds of trash pilled high at every can everywhere. Avoid this beach and head south to Hermosa or Redondo instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller

Only thing wrong with this place was sad to see how people leave their trash behind even though there were trash cans within reach everywhere. We had to pick up lots of paper and juice boxes before we placed our blankets down. They were all over the beach.. This place is family friendly and parking was only $8. There was also free parking along the highway (only if arriving early) but a steep climb if you are carrying coolers/kids. Airport is right behind it so if you prefer quiet, this place is not for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B4000DGandreac

A junior life guard during the summers and surfing the breakwater in ""D & W"" as a teenager it was a great place to grow up. I visit from time to time just for the memories it give me and the renewal I feel being there.I wish the city had maintained the breakwater.

30,Reply to Dale D,I haven't been to this beach but many others in LA. Obviously if you're in the flight path there will be noise. But what a great place to avoid tourists. My comment is to Dale D. All LA beaches will have these tar globs at some point or another.Did you notice the oil rigs in the ocean in the distance? These tar globs come from the rigs. Start demanding alternative fuels for your RV and stop using petrol based products and this will cease to be a problem on beaches all over the world.Humans are the cause of pollution and those people who say it is unacceptable should look in their own glass house before blaming the rest of the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebigd17

So near the very busy airport we had planes flying over us every 30 seconds even during the night. We didn't get any sleep. The view from the front was of lovely Venice beach but the view from the back was of a very ugly water & sewage plants. NO WIFI WHATSOEVER. the showers were very basic & utilitarian but clean but water didn't get warmer than tepid. No electric sockets in the showers so couldn't dry our hair.

30,Very Loud Airplanes,"So the kids wanted to watch the sunset at the beach. I don't know how they picked Dockweiler except that it does have several appropriately sized fire pits, and it does seem like a nice, clean beach compared to a lot of other beaches in the LA area. I thought the paved bike path look swept and safe. There was plenty of parking on a May Friday evening for watching the sunset and eating s'mores. The parking was just a few dollars collected in cash, on this particular day. Otherwise there is another parking lot up past the RV parking that takes credit cards for a little more than $10.There is a great overview of all the amenities at all the LA beaches at: http://beaches.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/dbh/beaches/You just click on the one you're interested in.Despite the amenities, I would never pick this beach for an activity where it was important to have a pleasant conversation with people. Every minute we were there, another jet launched out of LAX, right over our heads, and all conversations had to stop until the noise was low enough to be heard-over. Maybe some people don't mind it, but my idea of a good time is backpacking where the only human noise is me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmpdsc
40,Classic California beach,This beach can get crowded on the summer weekend but now it's perfect. Very few people. You can do bonfire till 10 pm. Great place for Bird watching ( I mean planes taking off at lax). Good waves for surfing . Close to Lax and Manhattan Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/174glenny
20,This is about the RV park,"Not much if any hot water, planes taking off from LAX go all night, so expect the Asian airlines to flying our at 3am.. you are right under the runway..the sewer plant behind the park is not noticeable until the wind changes.. at $60 a night can't say it is the best deal around. Maybe a night or two to hang on the beach..the place books up so is popular. Go for the spots to the south end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mykomyko
40,Great RV Park if you want proximity to Los Angeles,"I stayed at the RV park many times while my house was being remodeled. It was a great opportunity to enjoy the beach with direct access to the campsites. The park is well cared for with laundry available also. No WIFI, and poor cell coverage, but you're planning to surf the ocean not the internet, right? !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnc_19
40,"""Carpe Noctem!"" ~ One of the Best SoCal Bonfire Beaches","Dockweiler Beach12501 Vista Del MarPlaya Del Rey, CA 90293(310) 322-4951www.parks.ca.govDue to concerns of locals and environmental (air quality) implications, Beaches allowing bonfires are dwindilling. There are Cabrillo, Huntington, Bolsa Chica and Doheny but one of the best remains Dockweiler.By day One can play some Volleyball, Surf, hang out and enjoy this long expanse of beach that begins at Ballona Creek and runs south until it reaches neighboring El Segundo Beach... and at night there are 75 Fire Pits just waiting for frivolity!Get there before 5 pm to assure having a Pit.Parking cost between $6 and $8. Has RV hookups, costing around $50 a night. Restrooms are locked up at 9pm and you may be advised to, at least, give the appearance of starting to load out your party by 10 pm but often people are able to hang out and party much later into the night.""CARPE NOCTEM"" (""Seize the night"").... Beach Bonfires are one of my favorite SoCal memories. Be it jamming to tunes and tribal dancing around the flames or just mellowing out with a bunch of friends... or just with one friend, if ya know what I mean?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Circle of Friends Family and Fun,"When celebrating a birthday, where do you go? What do you do?Would your family/friends enjoy an evening at the beach?Dockweiler Beach is the perfect place for an evening party.Sitting around the fire sharing memories and making new ones.You can set up shelters. Bring firewood, food and games.Do not forget the cameras!!! For a little magic, store up some energy in solar lightsand string them around your shelter.The beach is very clean as are the restrooms.The pits are close to the sidewalk which makes easy access.As your evening winds down, just throw trash in containers,take down the shelter.Most relaxed party I have been to in a very long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bertaannf
40,A favorite for locals and tourists,Dockweiler State beach is great for day use and they have fire rings for evening use. Dockweiler has an RV park that is our favorite destination especially for folks like us who work all week and just want to get a way for a weekend. The RV is next to a bike/walkway and the RV sites are a short walk to the beach. They clean/level the beach every morning. It is so popular that it is sometimes hard to reserve a spot. This is a blacktop parking lot and RV spaces are rather small but folks are friendly and we see a lot of extended families who all park their motor homes together and then share cooking. There is a nice mix of families and retired folks as well as rental rv's. It seems rving is popular with Europeans who are always friendly. Only negative is that when the wind blows from the land is brings the nasty smell from the water treatment plant...and there is the constant noise from jets taking off from LAX. It is well lit and the bathrooms/laundry are kept secure via a locked code. There are standing picnic tables and charcoal grills at each site. Occasionally a homeless person walks through but I've never seen any vandalism or drug use. Security comes around a few times every day. I would recommend this site especially for people who like to bike because there is a bike path that runs for miles along the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momg2014
40,Great beach with wildlife,A lovely beach with active bird life. Enjoyed a barefoot walk and watching shore birds feeding in the surf.Amazing to see wild creatures hunting in their natural habitat so close to one of the world'a biggest cities and busiest airports.See a video of the local bird life at DavidLeeTravel.com.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5170EIdavidl
50,Beautiful place!,"We camped here for 3 nights and were so impressed with the location. There aren't many places were you can camp so close to the beach. I think our trailer was about 3 feet from the sand. We saw dolphins swimming and swam in the waves. We saw amazing sunsets and had awesome fires at night right on the sand. The bathrooms were very clean and the staff were very nice. And having really aware lifeguards on the beach was a great perk.It's true a lot of planes fly over, but it never bothered us. In fact, for our two little boys, it was pretty exciting! Oh, and the bike path right on the beach was so nice. You can ride for miles and it is a lovely route.We were there mostly midweek and it was so quiet. The only weekend night we were there was a Sunday. It was a little noisier later in the evening and definitely more crowded on the beach. But, people were enjoying the fires on the beach and just having a good time, which was fine with us. Come Monday morning it was so peaceful.We were very impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilbsmom
10,Horrible Accommodations,"It costs an excessive $12.50 to access the park where the bathroom situation is nothing short of horrific. I've been up and down the California coast from San Diego San Francisco and the bathrooms in El Segundo's are by far the worst. They were beyond unkempt - they were revolting. I expect much better for my money and from California. Contacted, the Department of Public Works in El Segundo freely admits that they have had significant sanitary and vandalism issues at the beach restroom facility with no sign of abating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/column_of_air
40,Wave at waves,I usually go to this beach and just sit and watch the water. It is so peaceful there. And they have reatrooms with locking doors. There are several parking lots. If you have a placard you can park free during the week. This will become my hide away spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeikiR
40,Good for a bike ride,"If you are looking for an uncrowded bike path by the beach, Dockweiler is worth considering. There is a long stretch of bike path and unlike Santa Monica, very few riders. Parking in the lot is a bit steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
30,Dockweiler RV Park,"Gave Dockweiler RV Park a second chance, why, because Bolsa Chica RV campground was full. But I and my spouse enjoyed ourselves this time. If you do not mind the constant planes overhead then you'll be fine. My only complaint is the RV park bathrooms, they could be kept cleaner. The positive of Dockweiler RV Park is the view of the beach, you never can go wrong with that kind of view. During the summer expect the Park to be full, with families and dogs. :o)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372kathieg
30,Beach was nice,"Overall we had a fantastic day. We did have a few negatives...the cost to park is more than any beach I have ever visited...$12.50. Based on that alone, I would not return. We paid $8 at another southland beach last week. We had to wait in a nice long line to use disgusting bathrooms (could have waited in no line for the port a potties). The beach was very crowded and the people there were trashy. We had several kids come over & try to steal the sandtoys we brought with us. We found beer bottles, water bottle caps, etc around the sand. We have ridden our bikes on previous visits & very much enjoyed the bike trail. The lifeguards were very attentive. The best part? The water was beautiful. It was clear and not too cold. There wasn't much seaweed floating around and the waves weren't too strong. I absolutely love laying on the sand watching the airplanes fly overhead. I think we'll most likely return but either not on the weekend or not during summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419lindseyh
40,Nice LA beach RV park,"We have camped here twice. The RV park is right on the beach. You get full hookups and clean restrooms. There is a nice coastal bike path. So, you can explore the area. It is not the quietest park though, with planes flying overhead and some loud campers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhO6548JS
30,"Great for bonfires, but get there early!!","Recently decided to make some s'mores by the beach and Dockweiler seemed to be a good place for that. Not knowing what to expect, we packed up some chairs and all the goodies. We arrived about 7 pm on a Sunday and all of the bonfire pits were already taken. Someone told me you need to go at 6 am if you want to get a spot. I think the fire pits are great but i think there are nicer beaches to spend the entire day at. There are jets flying overhead, the beach is probably not as clean as others due to the fire pits and the amount of food people bring and the overall atmosphere is sort of party like. I brought my teen girls here but will probably look for another place in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,Not the prettiest setting,"Dockweiler State Beach has a unique setting -- under the take off pattern for LAX. The jets appear quite close as they are taking off, which I enjoyed for a while, but probably gets old. The beach is broad, with several walking/biking paths cutting through it. Considering that it's in a densely populated area, it gives the sense of being very isolated.I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Dockweiler State Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/too_few_trips_1
50,Lovely beach,We visited unplanned but the beach was wonderful. There was clean water and just enough crowd. Most importantly there was a nice bike trail that we used using a local bike rental. Great stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amzee
30,if you don't mind the sound of jets..,"1.2.2014 despite speculation of post holiday crowds we decided to go to the beach anyways. Surprise! The drive was smooth, light traffic and the Parking lot had ample spaces. Apart from the noise from planes taking off overhead frequently, this is a great beach for families. Very clean, wide stretches of sandy beach - user friendly set-up with fire-pits. Seniors with State Beach passes park for free, otherwise it is $6. There is also free Beach Wheel-chair check out near the Bike & Skates Rental place and restrooms. Impressive! I've never seen such like in other beaches before. Kudos to the State Beach for such inclusive policy! Several stalls in the women's rest-rooms wouldn't flush though. Schools of dolphins with their fins visible in the break-water were observed around mid-day. Delightful!I enjoyed watching the planes take off overhead - a novelty and a challenge to photograph.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
40,Nice stop before heading to LAX,"Free parking along the street, if you can find a spot. There are several ramps that lead from the street down the beach. I guess if you are planning on having a full beach day with coolers/umbrellas/etc, you would be better off paying to park in the lot.We visited around noon on a Saturday and there were plenty of open spots available to set up towels/blankets. Not a lot of shells but if you look hard enough, you can find a few.Edited to add that I didn't experience any black/dirty sand that other reviewers have pointed out. Maybe the area we were in wasn't that dirty?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celicacutie
40,Stay on the beach,This RV park is right on the beach. There are clean rest rooms and showers. We watched them clean the facilities every morning! The staff was friendly. Where else can you stay ocean front for $60 per night! We will go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afhanson72
20,The campground has gone down hill and he prices have gone up!!!,"We have been camping at Dockweiler for 7 years, as a private camp ground it was kept clean and maintained and now the state has taken over the camp ground it now is run down. There is trash everywhere, the grass is dead, the bbq's are damaged, the bathrooms are disgusting, the staff is rude and does not take ANY effort to answer any questions and during out stay 2 fights broke out. This is not a safe place for families. The prices have continued to go up but the campground has diminished. We are done with this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742michaell
10,Never Again!!,"The staff were not friendly, we arrived 40 minutes early before their check-in time with a trailer intow and had to pay an extra $17 or we could have waited for the time to pass once we got there but who would want to just sit outside the gate for 40 minutes? Staff at gates did not seem tounderstand or direct us correctly when we got there very well either. Any guests have to pay $8 for parking then walk a ways over to the RV section, they cannot park near you and cannot visit past 10 pm. Our 21 year old Son was so upset he left before our vacation was over! Airplane noise is constant and loud. Water treatment plant does smell! Not a great location. Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraShulman
50,"Great site, near the beach and the South Bay",RV park is clean (including bathroom and FREE showers); beach is 100 yds away; airplane noise is tolerable; full hook-ups worked,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/equally
40,tried hang gliding here,My hubby surprised me with hang gliding lessons here and it was quite interesting. We parked the car in the public parking right next to Wind Sports and walked to their office. We signed a waiver and then we went to meet our instructor. We were given our protective gear and then the lessons started. It was fun going up even if the dune wasn't too high. It was an introductory lesson but you can always take more advanced lessons. They're open only Wednesday to Sunday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ex-globetrottingbabe
50,A great weekend getaway for beach and RV lovers,"I live in the neighboring city of manhattan beach. The town is great and you should definitely check it out while your there. I went there in the family RV for a week while the house got tented for termites. I surf and it is great to just walk out and the ocean is at your doorstep. You can fit up to a forty foot RV (like mine) you just have to tell them it's 37'. Also, remember to pack earbuds for sleeping as the jets are pretty noisy. The do eventually stop for the night at 11:00pm but before then it is mostly larger planes on the red eye flights so it is even louder. Overall the place is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/455MattC
40,Dockweiler,"When i bought my first rv i went to this noise but nice state park , it is the direct flight path of LAX departures so it in loud and there are often loud parties to all hours of the night . the back row was the cheapest then , 12$ a night for dry camping , meaning no-hookups but i had a generator so no biggie , then they closed it for 6 month's and added hookups to get more money but during the winter months it sucks because they create this sand burm so you can't see the ocean at all , it was cheaper but people go there TO SEE THE OCEAN , when spring comes the burm is removed and of course the prices are immediately jacked up and NOW they are so high i can't even afford to go there , to bad because it used to be alot of fun . ps , those morons in NJ knowing a superstorm was headed in there direction should have had those tractors going 24/7 building sand burms , it would have saved them a fortune ! also i spent many beautiful x-mases at this park , it still have those million dollar memories",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprildoornbos
40,Pleasant experience - mostly.........,"We camped here last weekend in a trailer in one of the beachfront spots - very nice! You can see the ocean and waves from your camp spot. The most unpleasant thing about this RV park is the restrooms. My husband was appalled and let me tell you, it takes a lot for him to make a comment about something like this. He reported the disturbing condition of the mens room to the RV office and her comment was ""yes, there were a group of boys in there but you know I was busy here in the office doing my job and couldn't get them to leave!' The other unpleasant experience was not ours but rather our next door neighbors. During our first night, they had a motorized scooter and one of their six bicycles stolen even though they had them secured (though obviously not well enough) and they even had their windows open and heard nothing..........obviously someone experienced enough to have stolen these items and helping themselves to drinks from their ice chest as well. We tend to keep our valuable items inside so we had none of those issues ourselves. The location is fabulous and really, to be honest, we did not mind the multitude of planes taking off as most of them go over the day beach area more so than over the RV park. Yes, you hear the planes but somehow, the sound of them was more soothing than annoying. This spot may not be for everyone but we did enjoy our stay there - so much so that we paid for an extra day in order to not have to leave by check out time. Late check out costs $20/per hour which is ridiculous so if you plan to stay and enjoy the rest of the day as well as sunset, you might want to just book that extra day ahead of time anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Landylady50
40,Dockweiler RV Park on Dockweiler State Beach,"This RV park is right on the state beach. The parking is on level asphalt areas, each one has a picnic bench, grill and full hookups. The spaces are placed on a slant for views to the beach. The spaces are oceanfront, middle and back. Fees are determined on location of spot. (2nd time here and always had a space in the back - it was fine) The park has bathroom and shower facilities and full hookups. There are large RVs, pop-up tents and camper vans. Campfires are allowed on the beach.There is a fantastic bike path that runs directly on the beach heading off in both directions. About 5 miles to the south on the bike path there are some nice restaurants,(that way you can work up an appetite) to the north you can ride all the way to Santa Monica pier on the bike path with a relatively small amount of the path on the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TirelessTravelers
30,Can't beat a fire on the beach!,"We stayed in a mid-summer, sold out weekend, and while our immediate neighbors were fun, but respectful of others, some other areas of the campground had very loud and obnoxious groups. The staff did not seem willing to keep that in check. But did I mention how nice it was to get to have a fire on the beach? Reserve your fire ring early. Also, the rules says that you can only use their rings, but many brought their own fire puts and set them up on the sand. Again, staff didn't seem to mind. Beach was clean and not crowded, sand was soft with no rocks or debris, and the water was not far from the camp. Airplanes constantly, but not annoying. Bathrooms were clean and the showers were hot. Oh yeah, and you gotta love a fire on the beach! We'll visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1PaleWriter
40,nice LA getaway,"I like going to that beach, as I can park my park on the side of the street for free (just watch out for the red markings, where you're not supposed to park). The other nice thing is, that it is right by the LAX runway and you're able to watch planes flyby. Also, early mornings and afternoons, there aren't a lot of people out, so you can pretty much enjoy the beach for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gone_aforeign
40,Coming back just for this beach,Great local beach where there arent alot of tourists. They let you have bbqs and bonfires without permit. Bike path is insane like youre racing someone. Why doesnt Boston have something like this?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wdang
50,"Tell a friend, you found an awesome campgroud in LA!!","This campground was great. Full Hook-ups. If you like to RV camp, then you know full hook-ups are worth it.Docweiler State Beach Campground is clean and quiet. All of the campspots are the same. All equal in the view of the ocean. The beach front spots are right on the ocean and no obstructed view.There is no general store. So if you forgot something, you'll have to drive out of the park and to the nearest store.Restrooms are clean and spacious. The showers were free! No coins to operate the shower, like other State Beaches in Southern California.Firepits were a plenty. Easy walk from campspot to beach.No privacy between campspots. RV camping only. There is no tent camping.Otherwise it was a great visit and we plan to go back again and tell our friends of the great experience.PS...Located at the end of the 105 freeway, at the end of the LAX runway. The plane noise didn't interrupt our nice weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScenicSue
10,"In the words of the great Monty Pyton, ""Run away""","I went to this beach last year for a friend's birthday party. It's the only area beach we know of that allows fires, so that's why he chose this. The beach was ok, rather sketchy and right under the LAX flightpath. Bathrooms, horrid (some kind of a sludge covering the floor). Also, we were planning another evening outing, but there was a gang shootout there last week so we have changed out plans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boston-LA
40,Wonderful Eerie Views,"Being one of only two So. Cal. beaches that have firepits makes this the perfect getaway if you're looking to see a romantic sunset w/ that special someone or are planning a family outing. Excellent facilities, especially for the toddlers, who will marvel at the planes in the sky landing/taking off from neighboring LAX. Definitely a beach to visit at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspiration1645
