50,Great Little Black Box,"This is a great little black box theatre. Good programming, polite staff, considerate audiences and talented cast. Well worth attending!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,Lovely Theater,"Small 99 seat equity waiver theaters. Theater is in beautiful condition. Nice lobby area with snack bar offering coffee and yummy treats. Friendly staff. We found tickets using Goldstar, so that is an option. More than one show is going on at the same time and Odyssey seems to often stage well reviewed shows. After 6pm, there is lots of parking at the theater for $5. One block up there is street parking for free. I will definitely make a point of returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Tennessee Williams Gem,"Superb production of Tennessee Williams"" Kingdom of Earth"". Susan Priver, Brian Burke,and Daniel Felix de Weldon star in a play that has the seeds of many of Williams' later plays. The acting and staging are superb. Sadly, Williams was too ahead of his times to reap success during his lifetime for this well written 1967 play produced on Broadway. This production is an argument for supporting Equity Waiver productions (less than 100 seats) which provide a venue for stellar casts to do great plays at reasonable prices and also allow talented actors to showcase their work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6642MIkathyw

40,Good location and easy access.,"Went to see a very funny play. This is a small theatre with maybe 100 seats. Seats are comfortable, environment is comfortable and prices are very reasonable. There is plenty of parking in their lot or on the streets. Very friendly and organized staff. Plenty of places to eat in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
50,The best small intelligent theater in West Los Angeles,"The Odyssey is a three stage theater that produces excellent work. They do old plays, new plays (sometimes debuts), and classics. There are frequent and intermittent actors. Nothing is overproduced (it could not be for their budgets), and therefore it must be extremely well done to keep the houses occupied. My husband and I have subscribed for seventeen years. Tickets are often available on a few days notice - call the box office. There is not a bad seat in any of the houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCV999
