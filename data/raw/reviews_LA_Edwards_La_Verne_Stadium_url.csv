20,Beware of bugs,"I visited yesterday and was in theater 10. While there I was bitten by what I am to assume are bed bugs. Be careful! I called the next day when I did the employee that claimed to be the manager (found out this little nugget because my husband actually stopped by and spoke with the real manager) couldn’t care less and was very dismissive. We are supposed to be given the report from their pest control in the next 2 days. So far they’re failing the handling of this issue, I suppose only time will tell...",Jen S
50,Comfortable Reclining Seats & Easy Parking,"This is our ""go-to"" movie theatre. Love the smaller theatres and reclining seats.Check out the great deal for Seniors on Tuesdays.",LaVerneSue
50,Best seats to watch a movie,"They have reclining seats in all theaters which makes watching a movie a great experience. Theaters are small so you won’t fight a crowd to get in or get out. Plus, it’s not trashed like in other large theaters. They have 13 theaters for 2D or 3 D movies.",Hanan C
40,What an improvement,"I would give this 5 stars except for one reason. i am physically challenged and the restrooms are up a large flight of stairs.We stopped going here years ago because of this. They do have a handicapped restroom but the employees it for changing and when 2 go in, especially male and female, it takes them forever to come out. It is horrible waiting to go in.This trip someone was in there but I could not go up those steps...... The person that came out was definitely not handicapped and she was in there forever.Years ago they did have an elevator but was advised not to take it as it was out of service too much.I'm not sure what the answer should be except to have access by key only and NOT let the employees us it.But the new seats are amazing and made us both very comfortable. They do not have a closed caption unit that fits into the cup holder and that is a big problem as I am hearing impaired, so I do hope they get them, as they are wonderful.",Ella O
40,Comfortable Seats,"Shows General Releases, for Independent Movies with 'limited release' you need to go to Pasadena or Claremont.",Michael H
20,Dirty Floors and Roudy People,"We have been to this theatre before and its usually pretty nice but this time, it wasn't so nice. The floor was full of trash, I assume from the previous showing. There was a group of people, about 20, that had kids that were loud and roudy. The adults were too busy on their cell phones to watch the movie or have the kids sit down and be quiet. A theatre employee came in once but never said anything to the noisy bunch. We paid over $30 for the three of us to see a movie with our 3 year old granddaughter, who by the way, sat quietly and watched the movie. Between the trash under our feet and the rude noisy kids, I don't know that we will ever go back to this theatre again.",Ninee
50,Reclining seats!! YES!!,In love with recliner seating! Best way to watch a movie! We only see our movies here now!! Snack bar has soooo much food you can eat breakfast lunch and dinner here. You can even have wine or beer. Crazy!!,Sara G
50,Watch latest movie in style,"Love this retro theater. From the outside, it's like a blast from the past. Even buying a movie ticket is slightly different where you get to pick out your seats. We thought it was weird that they have assigned seats. Once we step into the viewing room, we understood. The seats are all reclining lounge chairs. The room and chair are spacious. It's like watching the movie in high end theater but paying regular price. Will definitely come back.",19025kaciet
50,Awesome place,I love the big comfy seats that recline! All seats are reserved at purchase so you don't need to rush and try to figure out seating in large groups! I purchased 15 tickets for a movie that started next week so that my group could all sit together - regular snack bar. Nothing fancy but nice seats,nafarrate2017
50,Movie Theatres,The Edwards in La Vern has redone all of their seating in all of the theaters. You have great stadium seating that is available. All theaters have recliner seats so you feel like you are sitting in the comfort of your own home. You are able to pick out your seat ahead of time through the regal app and fandango apps on your phone. The theaters are extremely clean and welcoming for all ages. Handicapped seating is available as well. The refreshment stand offers alcoholic beverages for those who are having a date night. This theater has quickly become my favorite place to go to the movies.,Shelly R
