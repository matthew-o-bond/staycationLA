40,Great spot after the game,Very cool place to hang out after Kings game. Street is closed off and there are lots of restaurants and activities before and after the game,Indah Edlightz
40,Good sound system. Need some changes.,"This theater is nice, intimate, and with good bars. What it needs is a lot of sofa on the side. Please make it a lounge. That gives the audience an option to go in to the show or relax outside. I could not stay there long enough to finish the show since my back and neck hurts too bad. If I could lie down for a while on a sofa, potentially I could stay there longer. People want to hang out, no necessarily listen to every song. Especially when it comes to an important event, so many beautiful people there, hang out is more interesting than most of the songs. I would like to hang out at outside, eat, mingle, people watch, and go in when my favorite artiest is on. People did not buy a ticket and drive there to watch, we are there to party. Please make it a party.","Leisure and Work Channel, Home Resort"
50,Host arena for the Espys,"This is location the hold the Espy awards at. Very big theater. Basically celebs sit on lower seating and ticket buying gyests are the top 2 levels. Entry is on north side of building, Red carpet is on SE side. Bars and snacks available on all 3 levels",bruce p
50,Judas Priest,What a great venue to attend a concert the sound is awesome. The only thing that slows a person down is the security line where too many metal heads show up wearing too much metal. Its easy access to the restrooms and the bar to get your buzz on.,Creeping_Death_LA
40,Jim Gaffigan,"There was a group of us that attended the Jim Gaffigan show one evening during a convention. The theater is really nice, comfortable and has good sound quality.

50,Great Theater!,"Great theater, easily accommodates events intended for intimate settings as well as larger scale productions.

50,Intimate and Clean,"Went to see a Indian musician here and expected the worse. Surprisingly it was such a delight. doors opened when they said they would.The Microsoft Theater has a capacity for 7,000 which is perfect and intimate.Concession stands had your standard snacking options with a few other yums.Wine/Beer and soda. They don't give lids anymore since there's no straws. The pace of the cashiers at the stands were great got through many people very quickly.Bathrooms were clean and had staff in there.Seating is nice and clean, you can't get lost. Every seat has a good view of the stage. Sound system was great. Visual effects are awesome.Parking is pretty good.. parked at the W Lot.And it's probably a better idea to come early and grab dinner at the restaurants since it's in the middle of LA Live.Will definitely be back for more concerts.",kat s
50,Great Theater,"My husband and I went to LA this past weekend to his his favorite singer Roberto Carlos. The concert was hold at the Microsoft Theater at dowtown LA.

Went to see Toni Braxton, Baby Face & SWV in concert and we enjoyed ourselves. I literally didn't want Toni to end the show, I wanted to see her perform all night. She was gorgeous and very entertaining. Oh, Baby Face did his thing too. Loved him as well and of course, SWV brought back high school memories. Small theater compared to others I've been to. But still, an experienced to remember.",JustAretha
50,Terrific theater for concerts!,"This was my first visit to the Microsoft Theater for an 80s concert. It's a really nice theater that reminded me of a few other similar venues I've visited such as Comerica Theater in Phoenix and the Oakdale in Connecticut. The theater was clean, and for an indoor venue, the sound was very good. I'm not sure if it's specific to the venue, but the concert a two-sided stage. While one act was performing on one side, the other act was getting all set on the other. Such a novel idea! It really kept this multiple-artist show moving along nicely. Location-wise, since downtown LA isn't the greatest place in the world, I strongly recommend parking in the lot closest to the venue for quick & easy theater access. I enjoyed my experience at this theater, and would gladly see a show here again!",Mdgrl79
50,Wonderful Concert,"My husband and I are always trying to find things to do for our monthly date nights. We found out that Jesús Adrián Romero (Christian singer we love) was going to be at the Microsoft Theater. We had never been there, when we walked in to the theater we were amazed of what a great view there is of the stage from whatever place you sit. I will definitely go there again to see someone in concert or if there is a good show going on.",Glenda J
40,First Timer Who Was Pleasantly Surprised,"It was our first time at this venue, so we googled to get a basic idea from other reviews on what to expect. The parking situation and cost seemed to be the biggest concern, so we took a Lyft which was an additional $20(round trip). Totally worth it! no aggravation and we were dropped about 150 yards from the theater, then afterwards were picked up curbside at the bar where we 'postgamed'. The tickets indicated a 7pm showtime, we arrived at 6pm, but then found out the show actually starts at 7:30. Not a problem, because there are plenty of restaurants and bars surrounding. We ‘pregamed’ at a bar, but be warned that on a Saturday night, all places are packed and service can be very slow. We dined at home, but our friends ate locally, and it took them over 2 hours to dine. A lot of reviews were stating the staff at Microsoft are rude, but we didn’t encounter that at all, they were all very helpful and pleasant. Once it opens, the lines are long, because of security measures, but they go pretty fast. They have in place walk through metal detectors, so it’s best to have your keys, change and phones out and ready to put in the basket. Ladies have your purses open and ready for their quick look through. The bathrooms are ok, and neither of us experienced any waiting. There are concession stands on each level, and like everywhere, long lines and a bit pricy. Drinks average about $14 each, beer (large can) or a small mixed drink (like 6 oz). Our tickets were purchased for us, and we were seated middle right loge. Normally, this concerns me, because we always splurge a little to get decent seats without second mortgaging our home. Since this place is smallish, the seats were fine. Once all are seated, there is basically no ‘passing’ room, without the men having to show their chivalrous sides and stand. With this being said, my hubby had a problem with the lady sitting behind him. Yes we understand everyone is happy, and there will be lots of clapping and whooting and such, but this lady, had a shrieking high voice, and it was within two feet from his ears. We both asked her politely to bring it down or lower her base, it was a no go. We normally take earplugs with us, but forgot them..such a huge mistake (but this is just an added gripe, not a problem for the theater itself). The sound quality is a little off, but then the concert was with 60’s-70’s bands, soo yeah. Overall, this venue is a decent place to sit and enjoy a concert, and we would go back using the same game plan.",sallybsaywhaat
40,"Smaller Arena, Great Place","This is not a large venue, so is great for music. The orchestra seating is large, as i believe it has about 50 rows, so you want to be in the single letter rows, front row starts with A, then moving to the rear, going to double letters after Z.The sound to me was great, but i am sure that is clearly a personal opinion for each.Plenty of places in the area for before or after drinks or dinner. Area can be crazy if there is a event at Staples Center during the same time.",Batdog62
40,"Technological environment, beautiful at night.","Came here in July, trying to get distracted from work and found myself walking with lots of cosplayers. After a bit of a walk around, trying to alleviate the heat, started talking to some of the cosplayers when they invited me to attend an event in the theater. Went inside and whatever... you probably don't want to know about that.The theater is quite ample, I imagine concerts in there must be really good as the acoustics were quite decent. Even with lots of people talking around you had crisp sound coming from the speakers.As a tourist, I found the place interesting, even though I wouldn't just come here to talk a look. Also noticed a gazillion pokemon players walking around not paying attention to their surroundings (not that you may find that appealing).The theater has a few restaurants around and plenty of seats for you to rest a few minutes, although I completely do not recommend it towards the middle of the day, when I came out of the theater the heat was scorching and I was instantly filled with regret as I gave back the pass and was unable to come back to the comfort of the AC.",rodrigoelp
50,Great concert venue!,"This is a beautiful, clean, nicely decorated and well run facility. I've been to three events in different levels of seating and all were very good. Security and general employees are very pleasant and organized. I feel safe in this venue both inside and outside on the premises. Parking is right next door and easy in and out with great security. Inside there is a lounge area downstairs with comfortable seats and televisions to be able to view the concert in real time. Overall a fantastic experience and highly recommended!",deedeekeel

50,80s night concert,Went there on July 27th to see an 80s night concert. I'm not really into this type of music I'm more Metals guy but this venue is excellent to see a concert at. Saw an 80s night concert. It started with them pretty boys where the musicians were fine the singer sucked. Then it went into the main attractions of Thomas Dolby who performed and was by himself and was pretty damn good. Next attraction was softcell featuring Marc almond. He was good then came Berlin they were good. Then came the first of the two main attractions Adam Ant. He was excellent he put in a lot of time and effort to his hour plus set and was fantastic. The finale was Blondie who is very good too.,Craig B

30,VERY LONG LINES!,"I went to see a matinee performance of Shen Yun this last weekend. The rating here is for the venue and not the performance.Microsoft Theater is very comfortable and a great stage...but...the venue seriously needs to figure out a more efficient way of getting the folks outside in line INTO their seats!!! The lines were unbearable and many of the people waiting outside missed a good 30 mins of the performance.Also, the people who managed to get inside on time for the performance, which was our group, just barely, we were interrupted by loud people walking in, the attendants at the top of the stairs didn't walk people to the correct rows and it's super dark and patrons don't know how far down to walk, have to turn their super bright cell phones on to see the row numbers and it's hard to do all that stuff quietly and without distracting not only the people paying to see the show but the people on stage!",Raegan K
20,"Show was fabulous, venue needs help.",Our front row seats were sized to fit a fourth grader. We are both of average height and normal weight. It's very hard to sit through a two hour show with your knees making friends with your chin. Tons of staff helping direct people to the right seats but a women's restroom attendant is also needed.,Corres

50,Great Venue,"Saw Bill Maher here. Great show, comfortable venue. We had good seats and we're able to see him on stage. For a close up view, there were huge screens on either side of the theater. The only drawback was the jerk in front of us turned sideways in his seat so he could see the screen. He could of stayed home for a video performance. Easy seats to locate, quick to empty afterwards. Easy, close parking. Would return in a minute.",jlwitaly
20,"Wow, did this place change in a matter of months. Avoid.","I have been to the Mircrosoft Theater before and found it really super and gave it a great rating. In a matter of months this place has turned into a dump.First, the place is not clean. We were there for a children's show, the first of the day, and the place had not been cleaned since the night before. The floor was sticky and the seats had popcorn on them.Second, they have not done a thing to improve their screens. They are dull and look like a TV I would toss in the trash. It was very hard to watch the screens when it was hard to see the stage. The pixels were giving me a headache and they cut the screen to show only part of the stage--this was a play like children's event so it would be nice to see all that is going on.Third, the service was terrible. I took my grandson to see a show. We went to get soda which came with a cap that would need a straw. I asked for one. I was told the space had ""gone green"" and they no longer had straws. I knew I was going to be in for a mess with a child and sure enough we did not get too far before it started to leak from the top. I went to the closest booth to get a napkin, it happened to be the bar. The bartender said, ""Well, you need a straw. Here."" No kidding. Now I am wet, my grandson is wet, but we have a straw. Their bar is a full bar and serving hard booze to Disneyland dads at 1PM in the afternoon for a kid's show. Have another martini and drive your kid---great idea-but hey, they have straws for the drinkers.Moving on, the place did not open on time, leaving us all outside to wait with small children. Once in, they did not open the doors to seating on time and the show did not start on time. Again, a kid's show.All in all it was a miserable experience. And to top it all off, if you are disabled, I hope you are wheel chair bound, because if not, good luck walking close to a mile to the theater, with a handicapped pass. Just disgusting.",elizabethlascheid

We went for the 'Thousand Helping Hands Music Performance' on 10/1/17. The line was long and confusing. Security check points were slow.

Easy walk two blocks North.Only negative on the experience was entering the venue which had a line. The staff seemed overwhelmed and were screaming at people to walk around the corner where there was no wait, but there was. The concert started right ontime even though a few thousand were still in line and waiting in the wings. Unsure if they have control on when the concert starts but they should have some on getting people in rather than having people wait 30 minutes outside.",_leland_

50,Wonderful Venue to See a Concert.,"You will love the Microsoft Theater. It is not huge like Staples and most of the seats are good. The sound system is the best in the City and there is no seat where you will not have excellent sound.They tend to sell out so grab tickets beforehand. The events tend to start on time. Make sure you don't have anything stupid in your backpack or they will take it away.Parking is a bear and usually around $25 which is absurd, but you have little choice unless you take public transportation. Since you have to spend so much just to park, get there super early and have a great dinner at any of the eateries right there. Microsoft is part of LA LIVE so there are stores and food and fountains. You will really love it.Have a great time.",elizabethlascheid
40,Harley unveil,The 2018 Harley unveil was held here. Was a nice venue and very unique with pictures all over the place. One of the things I thought they could do better is the security clearance.

It replaces the now gone Universal Amphitheater, which was bulldozed for some stupid theme park ride at universal studios. The sightlines are great, sound is almost what it was at UA. I've been to a number of shows there now and this past time they'd added an entrance on the side of the venue, easing the lines out front. If an artist you like is performing there, I highly recommend it.",Cabomiamor

I've never been in a more impressive theater. The view of the stage was great from any angle (I tried many). The sound travels nicely throughout the place. The lighting system looks amazing.

Come early if you want a snack or drinks because you can't take them into the theater. Lines are long at intermission. So, take restroom breaks during the show. But, they don't let you back in during acts. So, you will miss a bit of the show. Parking is a problem in downtown L.A. Better to take public transportation. We found a lot not too far away that was reasonably priced and walk a few blocks. Plenty of shops and restaurants to see or go to. So, spend the whole day or evening there after the performance! Right next to Staples' Center.",teresa w

Purchased the VIP Experience package, which includes parking, food, drink, and special entrance. Not sure it is a good value, but it sure is nice. Parking is closest to the theater, you have a special entrance, and they treat you like a VIP. The food was good, and who doesn't like a free buffet.The only problem is the people working around the theater do not know about the VIP program. I asked two different people where I needed to go for VIP will call and they sent me to two different places on different sides of the building. All along the entrance was the closest point to the parking garage, but their employees didn't know that.It was a fun night, and a great experience, but I probably wouldn't pay that much again.",Kenton M
40,Great venue and sound system,"The area surrounding the Theater is BUSY which produces heavy traffic! The Kings were playing at Staples Center and thousands of people showed up for Who Wants to Be President by Bill O'Reilly and Dennis Miller. Good show but would have been better if they eliminated the intermission. We purchased our parking pass for $25.00 when we bought our tickets online which is highly recommended. That way you know exactly where you are parking. There are escalators, elevators or stairs to take you up to ground level. We saw several places to eat around the Microsoft Theater such as Smashburger which doesn't cost a days wages. We had seats in the Orchestra section Row FF 301 and 302. They were alright but if we go there again, I would only pick seats in Row D - W to be closer to the stage. Fortunately, they have two huge screens on each side of the stage which helps if your seats are not close. The handicap section of seats directly behind the Orchestra section looked to be perfect for seeing the stage well.",KarenK518

Parking wasn't an issue as we stayed nearby in Koreatown and took an Uber. The show was a throwback, ""I Love The 90's"" and the excellent sound and lighting quality made it TONS OF FUN! My only (and minor) qualm was that the ushers sent us in circles a couple of times, clearly unfamiliar with the seat in charts. Not to worry though, there wasn't a bad seat in the house and we enjoyed the concert over all.",avidiva6

Legroom is tight for anyone tall (over 6ft) . Was continually knocking my knees on the cup holders. My biggest issue is the mediocre concessions. It continually amazes at just about every venue in LA what a miserable job they do in the area of concessions . The Microsoft theater doesn't raise the bar in this area. Tallboy cans of beer. Bottles of soda and water you have to server yourself. Limited edibles of popcorn and red vines. Eat before you get there until these visionless folks improve their offerings!",Mark T

It was a confusing situation and drove a lot of people nuts.The other issue was regarding an usher. I was taking a picture and she lost her mind. Even though I had asked other ushers, she stormed up to me and demanded I stop.

Still need to walk a block to the theater.It is a huge venue. The theater is clean & maintained very well. The food & drinks here are pricey. Will suggest to eat in the restaurants near the theater first.Overall, a landmark in Los Angeles!!",ILoveFoodComa
30,Average Overall Experience,"The three stars are for good sound. They could do a *much* better job of advertising their seats appropriately for customers who buy tickets online. We never got to select our seat, just the section. The system automatically assigned the worst seats in our section to us. Fine, if the concert was sold out. But on the day of the concert, when we knew the concert was not sold out, the staff were unwilling to switch our seats to empty seats on a different side of the same section we were in. Here's how my conversation went at the ticket booth:Me: ""Are there any available seats I can get in my same section so I can actually see the people on stage? Right now we only see the person that's right in front.""Rep: ""Yes, there are seats available.""Me: ""Can you please switch my seats? I'm happy to pay any difference.""Rep: ""The new seats cost the same as yours, but you'll have to buy the new seats from scratch and forfeit your existing seats which are non-refundable.""So in summary, although the venue is okay from a purely technical standpoint, don't expect to get much support if you don't like the $150 seats you never got to select in the first place and then wanted to change at a show/concert that wasn't sold out. I get the non-refundable policy, but it's inherently designed to be a detriment to buyers, and I for one am far less likely to want to check out a performer here than at other locations in Los Angeles. For a venue that bears ""Microsoft"" in its name, the unpleasant seat buying experience needs serious upgrading, as does the customer service on site.",inavigator
40,A Glittery Location...with cement floors,"I visited Microsoft Theater in August, 2015. The whole area surrounding the venue is quite upscale with bright lights, neon and trendy restaurants. I felt safe because there were many people about. Please investigate parking before you come because nearby lots are expensive. Park a little further, walk, and save exorbitant rates. The theater had good acoustics and is a fairly new venue. However, be warned it resembles a giant movie theater with cement floors. I guess I expected a bit more sophisticated atmosphere. Beer, wine, sandwiches, and I think hamburgers were sold in the lobby. Beer logo signs were posted on the walls behind the drink stations. People were walking into the theater with styrofoam trays and eating at their seats. Hence, the uncarpeted, cement floors. The ambiance reminded me a bit of a sports event venue. This is a newly renovated theater, but it will not be long before food and drink stains mar the floor. There should be an eating area set up outside the theater. Two large screens are posted on either side of the auditorium, so everyone can see and hear the performance well. In summary, it is decent, clean venue, but not necessarily classy or sophisticated in atmosphere.",Bgoodtoall
50,Friday Night Concert.,"Beautiful venue, Love the area the parking the employees the area where is located is a gorgeous promenade. Not a Bad seat in the whole Theatre, had a great time the employees are very cordial (specially Beverly @ the Basement Bar). everyone had a smile on, Traffic is very bad other than that can not say anything negative.",Blanca M

50,Beautiful Downtown LA!!,"You can go for a drink and or dinner before or after the event. The arena is big and beautiful and you can pretty much see the show from every seat. The staff are friendly and helpful. I Highly recommend if you are going there for an event, make a day or whole night out of it, the place is surrounded by beauty and fun.",NeedsAVacation25
40,Great Tour!,We had the chance to take a private tour of this iconic building and we loved it. We learned so much about the history and the making of it as well as what happens behind the scenes when the big shows come in town. Great few hours spent there wondering around a very famous stage!,The World is My Oyster

50,You are the star song stars!,"Nokia theatre and then going through Red Carpet to Stamples center is a star adventure! Grammy season is a whole week of parties, stars and awards! But you have to be prepared because it is also tiring and ones need extra care because they clean those carpets with very heavy chemicals and allergic people has to go with mask.It is an interesting thing to go but it is not awesome. It is special only during games and Grammys! It is a huge space with chairs and lights.People who go there make the ambience! But have a go!",Anaya K
20,TOO LOUD AND BAD SEATING ARANGEMENT,"My husband and I just visited the Nokia theater for the first time and saw the Dancing With The Stars Live tour. We did NOT have a good time.First of all, when we bought our tickets, the row we bought somehow didn't look that far away. Once you get there and sit in that seat though the stage looks REALLY far away. Ours were center ground floor level and row QQ. I couldn't even see the faces of the dancers. I realize they do have very nice tv screens hanging on the wall but if I am paying that kind of money I want to actually be able to see the people. The seats are also not staggered very well. Some seats had more of a stagger than others. We just happened to get so lucky that ours and the row in front was not really staggered at all. The 2 really tall people in front of us totally blocked our view. If there had been more of a rise with each row that would have helped.Our second complaint was the sound. OMG was it loud. I have been to several concerts (at other venues) and never had to hold my hands over my ears. I left this event feeling like my ears should be bleeding.If you go to this venue and want to see the people I suggest you stick with seats in the first 20 rows or so and maybe bring some earplugs just in case.",2travelersasof2001
50,Dancing with the Stars Live!,"What a great theater. Clean, not a bad seat in the house, attentive and VERY friendly (and helpful) staff. Terrific venue for a play or concert.",Krasman123
40,Miku expo!!!2014,This is a great place for experiencing a concert. I visited in october 2014 for miku expo and had a blast. Its worth it to get close seating!,marju010
40,Saw Cat Stevens at the Nokia Theater,"Cat Stevens was awesome but if I went to the Nokia Theater again for a production or music, I would sit close to stage. While row N second level was a good seat, the layout is not that great once you start sitting away from the stage. Entry into in the place was ridiculous, free-for-all as any entrance you could find was a way in. Maybe it was just the ""LA LIVE"" experience...pretty frenetic, reminded me of the Universal City Walk only faster paced. Overall though safe place to go enjoy yourself.",Vincent D
50,"Beautiful theater, great seating","I came here for the Adobe MAX conference and sat in here for several general sessions. We filled the entire lower level. The seating is comfortable, and there are cup holders. The sound system and visuals are incredible. Great venue. Bathrooms are conveniently located outside the auditorium exits.",MissLenore
40,Emmys and Grammys famous venue,"I have been at this venue for different shows and, coincidentally, I have always been sitting on the right hand side of the theater, don't ask me why. Nevertheless the venue is great, very accessible and easy to get out once the show is over, it does not feel claustrophobic as on many other venues. There are plenty of restaurant where to eat before the show, very important you make reservation if you want to get a nice meal (expensive but, hey, once in a while...). If you park underneath the Nokia you can get validation at the restaurants, you will ended up saving $5 on the parking (not too much), there is 3 hours free but be prepare to pay between $20 and $25. There are more parking lots around the area but I don't like them very much.Go to the Nokia Theater, any seat is good and you may be seating in the same seat that many tv stars and famous singers celebrate their Emmys and Grammys, a truly L.A. landmark.",Yolanda M
50,Excellent!!!,"Just visited for the first time for Marc Anthony Concert. Because I invited friends, I wanted it to be as pleasant as possible, so I purchased the Nokia VIP experience package (approx $35 per person in addition to the ticket) to be in the better section of the theater (front orchestra), have access to the VIP bathroom, and one VIP parking. Even though food & beverage service was included, I chose to dine at a restaurant within L.A. Live.The only complaints I have about this experience is that the ticket pick up was only available via Will Call and the limo we took had to park elsewhere because the parking garage did not accommodate a stretch limo. Also, it would have been nice if the rep contacted me earlier than the very afternoon we were headed up there, with a lot of information.The actual experience once there, was very pleasant. Security was everywhere, which I really appreciate. The venue was very clean, and we had excellent seats so the concert was very enjoyable, but it's not a huge theater so I think it would have been enjoyable anywhere.I would definitely return there for different events.",rumbanow
40,Nice venue,"This is a good place for a concert. It's best to buy good seats though. All the concession and bar stands (expensive) are available. Parking prices fluctuate based on what else is going on in the area, generally $20 - $25. It's nice to buy a VIP package that provides closer parking, access, food and drinks.",RhonniH
50,Perfect Venue for Concert!,The Nokia is the perfect place to watch a concert. Any seat is a great seat! I love the sound quality as well.,Marina V

10,"Shen Yun was awesome, parking option was atrocious!!","Went to the Nokia Theater on 3-23-14 for the 1pm performance of ""Shen Yun"".Loved the performance.My grandmother and I paid $60 for each of our tickets.However, I was taking my elderly and handicapped grandmother with me and there was no place to drop her off!!The front was blocked off by some other deal (didn't bother to find out what), and I pulled over just passed it to the side of the building to drop my grandmother off!!The signs said that there was no stopping at any time, and my grandmother was nervously trying to hurry out of the car before we were confronted by Nokia employees, or the police!!I turned the corner to find parking and found a Nokia employee directing drivers to the parking loot entrance around another corner to the left.I got my parking stub at the entrance, but didn't have time to read past the $5 for the 1st 2 hours of parking. I wrongly assumed that it would, maybe, be a maximum of $10 for the length of the show.The Nokia employees took my grandmother to one seat and another - making her climb stairs with her curved back, weak hips and cane!!These guys didn't even KNOW their own theater!!There were only 2 elevators - that barely worked!After the show, the front of the theater was STILL blocked, and I had to walk my Grandmother to the side of the building and lean against one of the planters!! There were no benches!!I got back to my car in the parking lot, and had to sit there for THIRTY MINUTES because the lot employees closed all the exits, save for ONE, and there were only TWO people there (for hundreds of cars) to collect the fees!!When I finally got to the attendant, I was charged TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THREE HOURS OF PARKING!!!This turned out to be an expensive and dissatisfying outing and overtook the remarkable experience of ""Shen Yun""!!If I can give this experience a negative star, I would.We will NOT EVER be attending Nokia Theater again!We will NOT be going to a downtown theater, again, either.",Amy W
40,Cool experience,"Did the Grammy announcements concert here! Was a great time. Seats were AWESOME in the middle orchestra section row G. Got in easy, found our way to our seats easy, people were helpful. On commercial breaks all the tweens went INSANE trying to get up front to talk to the musicians which was hilarious to watch and annoying. Security could not get control of that. Other then that, would definitely go back, would like to go to the people's choice awards next!",cksteeve
40,Great to see a big show,"I went there to see the People's Choice Awards. Going in through security is going smooth but there's no way to go out again (for a ciggy break) and get back in.Seats were great and the view to the stage is great, even if you're in the back. Huge monitors make sure you don't miss anything.Security is relaxed once inside, we were able to take pictures and video, no hassle. What I didn't like is that you weren't allowed to take snacks bought inside the theater (pop corn, drinks) to your seat...",Mark B
10,You can't PAY me to go back,"I'm hard-pressed to understand why anyone thought this was a good idea: a giant entertainment complex adding more congestion to the already hugely congested junction of two major freeways in Downtown Los Angeles. Throw in the variable of rush hour and you're in for a REALLY FUN experience, especially when multiple events are taking place at the same time. Why on God's Green Earth the exiting freeway traffic was funneled into the same two lanes already gridlocked from surface street traffic defied understanding. Somebody apparently also thought it a good idea to barricade access through the center of the complex forcing hundreds and hundreds of cars to fight tooth and nail, jockeying for position in the SINGLE LANE OF TRAFFIC orbiting the complex and into the parking structures. Perhaps if there had been sufficient manpower on the scene directing traffic the situation might have been workable, but the folks on duty didn't seem too involved. I'm guessing that the journey from 11th and Figueroa into Gate B of Lot W took us roughly 45 minutes: considering we're talking about a distance of roughly two long city blocks, that's pretty pathetic. Of course, the complex made up for the poor planning by stationing automatons in the parking structure who did little other than point and grunt when asked simple questions. Honestly, we hated the place before we ever got inside. Our first (and hopefully last) visit to the Nokia was hands-down the most aggravating theatregoing experience I've been through and I was left wondering whether there are higher than average road rage statistics in the vicinity.To the Nokia's credit, the stage is pretty good sized and there are great big screens to bring the action on stage even more up close and personal. It would've been nice to have a bit more slope to the seating, giving the shorter folks in the back a better view of the stage, but OK, I guess that's what the screens are for. I got that. To their credit also was that the people working inside were pretty amiable and apparently TRYING to make the best of being stuck in the chaotic mess they got to call their work environment.Unless I can be lowered from a helicopter (thinking ""I Love Lucy"" here) it's unlikely that we'll be visiting this venue again. I'd rather drive to Orange County or San Diego than go through that again.",Gail G
40,Nokia great!,"Great venue, in the active LA Live area. However, drinks are weak so ask for doubles. Parking though plentiful is expensive so consider using the Metro.",la sprezzatura

40,Pretty Good Conference Venue,"I was with a group attending a 1 1/2 day conference and found various pros & cons for this venue for conferences.Pros:-Mail floor seating was on a slope so we could see over the heads of the people in front of us.-The lighting, sound, and video were excellent quality.-Theater seats were large to easily accommodate adults of all sizes.-Restrooms had numerous stalls.-There were plenty of pleasant people working at the theater so buying refreshments was quick and there was always someone close by to ask questions of when needed.Cons:-Concessions were limited to things like hot dogs (no hamburgers), popcorn, candy, bottled soda & water ($4 each for waters!). There was, however, a Caesar salad available, which I very much enjoyed.-Entrance to the theater was s l o w. Attendees must enter one of the many doors one at a time so they can have bags checked, hand over anything metal in pockets, and walk through a metal detector. If you made the metal detector beep, everyone behind you had to stop while someone used a wand to screen you further. -Outside food & beverages were not allowed, which was frustrating because of the junky food they served inside.-On the first evening of the conference we were not allowed to re-enter after leaving. This was not well-communicated as evidenced by people standing outside the theater looking for the rest of their party, thinking they could go back inside to look for them, but not being allowed.-The flow of people traffic coming from the orchestra level seats to the restrooms, around the merchandising table, to the exits was a nightmare. The lobby simply wasn't spacious enough to accommodate the numerous breaks where people moved about.The bottom line is that the inside of the Nokia Theater is top-notch. Seats are spacious, row numbers are lit up in the dark, ushers abound and are helpful. However, as a conference location, I think it is lacking much.",Denise A
50,Makes L.A.Look Like A Real City,"Walking toward the Nokia, one could imagine being in a real city like Tokyo, Berlin, or New York. It looks modern, alive with people walking and interacting. Inside the theater is large and well organized. Even the restrooms were well laid out!",Dantala

Went to see Steely Dan last night in Los Angeles after bombing out getting tickets here in San Diego.I was NOT disappointed and am super happy that we made the trip.We were a little nervous - hadn't been to Nokia theater before so we were unaware of the venue etc. Hey - it's Steely Dan. Who cares.Every bit of the experience at Nokia was AMAZING. The staff was WONDERFUL to us - and to everyone who was hanging at the show. Bartendars asked how our night was going, engaged us in conversation. Super friendly. Made us feel COMPLETELY welcomed. The folks that showed us our seats - same thing. ""We hope you're enjoying your time here."" Seriously - everyone was spot-on with the customer service aspect and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit there.Bathrooms were SPOTLESS. How often can you say that when you go to a show? Entire PLACE was spotless.Never ran into an employee that wasn't smiling and had a pleasant word to say.

I had only seen the theatre on tv for various award shows and was really looking forward to the ceremony. The theatre did not disappoint. Sound quality was amazing, large screens helped everyone to see what was happening on stage (if you weren't fortunate to have great seats). The seats were comfortable and spacious-i wish other venues and sports arenas would take note and put in this style seat. Getting our tickets and finding our seats was a breeze. The ceremony was almost 5 hours long but it didn't feel that long due to how comfortable the seats were, the great sound system and of course the amazing production of the ceremony itself.",Earl_says

It looked like a Costco( the ceiling) than a regular theater. The chairs were so close to each other that I felt the gentleman sitting next to me( a little overweight) was taking one third of the space into my seat. Thankfully I had my husband sitting next to me to lean over in order to compensate for the space taken by the fellow who sat next to me. I would think twice before attending an event at the Nokia.",Judy C
50,The Pit area is the best. Try to always get tickets for this area.,"I just saw a show last night and i had tickets that landed me in the 'Pit'.Basically i was 4th row from the stage. Perfect in my opinion. However my partner wanted to be in the front row or near the edge because she wanted to go down the aisle and be able to get to the stage and reach to the artist while they were singing.She was very happy nonetheless, and we had a great time. We stayed at the JW Marriott and simply walked out and immediately walked into the Nokia Theatre.Wonderful location, you really can't beat it, if you stay at the JW Marriott.They dont have a Coat room, but otherwise it was a perfect experience.

To my surprise it's not as ""nice"" as I thought it would be in term of the stage (but I guess this may varies from which events renting this place and decorate it up). I got some of the further seats but was able to see the stage fine.Nevertheless, at some point during the concert some of the ushers who were standing at the doors near to where I sat started to engage in very loud conversations and got ""shushed"" by some of the audiences. It was quite rude and very unprofessional as they distracted us from watching the concert. Especially during some of Yanni pieces of music that are low melodic piano got partially drowned out by these loud ushers. Again very rude and inconsiderate.

Once we were there the guys didn't know the prices of drinks and it took them a long time to pour a drink. I figured I would give them an easy task and have them pour me some beer.
