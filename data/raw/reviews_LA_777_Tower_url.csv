30,"Frankly, I expect more from Cesar Pelli.........","Cream colored metal surface on exterior rises to the sky. It is kind of boring.The three-story lobby, on the interior, is faced with what looks like Italian Red Lavante (Rosso Levante) Marble. Very impressive, but there are mistakes in installation. The corners on the wall behind the main desk were not properly cut, probably because the shape of the wall changed after the marble was ordered and cut, so these corners are now filled with grout and caulk that is falling out and it looks sloppy and takes away from the perfection that was intended.Much of the marble was also intended to be installed in a book-matching pattern. This takes the naturally occurring patterns in the stone and matching them at the seams as a mirror image which creates a butterfly effect pattern. Unfortunately, the marble slabs are there but the installers either did not have the understanding or did not care to properly match the slabs, as many are reversed and rotated and do not match. It is a shame.The signage for the floors that the elevators travel to, was placed and ground into the marble wall so high, that no one see it while walking by. It was deemed unusable...so now the elevator banks are marked by additional signage at eye level to be seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/differentname
