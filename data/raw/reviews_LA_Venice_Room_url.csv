40,Try it...,"I've driven by this curious looking building several times before taking the plunge. I wasn't disappointed. The bar is friendly, with bartenders Stephen and Jeff introducing.themselves to newcomers, and providing.good, quick service. Obviously a REAL.locals spot, I had no problem.engaging in conversation with those around me. Enjoyed the mix of 80's lively dance music. The entree menu is limited - STEAK. That's your choice - STEAK. The freshly prepared bar appetizers are reasonably priced and what you'd expect....jalepeno poppers, chicken tenders, pizza, etc...portions more than ample for sharing. (I didn't have a steak, so I cannot speak to the quality of the meat.). I'll return when I'm the mood for a 12os strip or looking for a fun post-work watering hole. Try it - you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelE505
40,Kitschy Dive Bar Dining Experience,"Go for the steak and not much else. Went for lunch and had to flag down someone to let me know what to do. It was my first time and I did not know the ropes. Lots of locals, but if you are looking for a hello, you might be disappointed.The salad is basically a bag of iceberg with some cabbage and that is it. Big jars of dressing and a big roll for your steak. Baked potato has only butter. If you want a kitschy CA experience out of a movie, then this is for you. If you want fancy, table service, attentive staff, and variety of food options then go elsewhere. No fish, no chicken, nothing but a good steak, that is if you cook it well yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardhY8690TH
40,A very different experience!,Went there a few years back and had a very fun and different dining experience. You cook your own steak and they even have Karaoke!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3185GQpaulw
40,Cool Cocktail Lounge,"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. Visited recently and it still has that great, old time Las Vegas lounge ambiance that I seem to gravitate to. The cool part is that you grill your own steaks indoors! Dinner comes with a baked potato, salad and bread, but we opted for the ""special"" which included a bottle of wine for a really great price. I would recommend this place for couples or small groups.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785TeresaL
50,Swankiest bar in town,"Went here for drinks on Thursday night, couples date . The ambiance is unparalleled in style - like a Las Vegas lounge from the 1960s. The place looks so cool and the drinks are affordable. They also had karaoke going on with some really good singers. Recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrishuber
40,Grill Your Own Steak! It's a lot of FUN!,"Plus on Wednesday, their special is steak sandwiches or hamburgers your way (made with the same wonderful steak as you have on the grill) Included is a side salad or potato salad, or fries or chips. Plus, plus, good drinks from a good bartender. Family owned and operated since the 50's. A must try!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveler0109
40,Dinner,Was a great price for a steak dinner as long as you don't mind doing the grilling. Yes indoor grilling done by yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhW5181RG
50,Old school since 1955,"I've been driving by this place for years finally stopping by to try it out for dinner. Buy a steak and cook it yourself, something I don't want to do when I go out but it was kind of fun cooking my steak. They offer specials on some beers and the food isn't expensive. Looking forward to going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
40,A throwback setting where you cook your own steak,"I had heard about this place, and I must have driven by hundreds of times. It's startling when you walk in because the bar is so dark on a sunny day. It reminded me of the kind of place you expect to see your parents having a drink after work - dark, old-school setting. The food that most come for is the steak, which each customer has to cook for themselves. The quality of the cut is quite good, especially for the price. They have lots of seasonings to flavor your steak with, before you toss it onto the grill. We were behind a guy who had 3 steaks because his table designated him to be the grill guy. I'll attach pictures and you'll see how the grill is used.This has to be a good place to eat because we saw a lot of uniformed police eating here, since the Training Academy is so close by. Cops know where there is a good deal on a meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,A wonderful and unusual place to drink and have a self-grilled steak!,"A friend of mine wanted to take me somewhere special. We both grew up in Los Angeles, and went to school together all those years.And we always prided ourselves on knowing all the “secret spots” of LA, which we loved to show off to visiting guests, who only knew of Hollywood Blvd, the Beach and Disneyland. There is nothing like the look on their face when you show them something never before seen, something that hasn’t even made its way into a million hours of movies or TV. I mean, yes, the Bradbury Building Is truly a must-see, and we all want to relive “Blade Runner” moments in it, but showing places that have the magic wonder of history always becomes the highlight of their visit. So, when he showed me a ""new place"" I became that “visiting tourist”. It was somewhere ""secret"" that I even never heard of before. locations here, “right off the freeway”) to the Venice Room. It's called the Venice Room, and is in Monterrey Park, which sounds far away, but is really only about fifteen minutes from Downtown Los Angeles. From the outside you already knew you were in a rare place in LA… something that actually has been around longer than the newest viral cat video. Inside I was already in love with this old bar. You could feel the age, in a good way. Like 25 year old whisky. I was ready to just relax on one of their comfortable old red leather stools, and allow myself to let the ambiance, and the old original Italian murals waif over me. But that wasn’t the “big deal” here. There is a back room. About twelve large leather booths. And as with any good bar, low light that allows you to stay in a dreamy state, where time and place disappear under its spell. This is their “dining room”. But it has yet another special quality. Their menu is very simple. A few cuts of steak. And that comes with a potato, a roll, and the use of a nice, but small salad bar. But wait, there’s more. They don’t ask you how you like your steak, since they don’t cook it. You do. There is a grill at the far corner of the room. It’s well ventilated so the room does not fill up with smoke, but is perfectly hot to the right temperature to create a sealed sear, and with some easy prodding and flipping of your meat, getting it to exactly the way you like it. Above you are dozens of bottles of spices, and herbs and salts and other assorted ingredients to customize your steak. Your baked potato comes to you perfectly cooked, though I would recommend cutting it open and putting it on the grill itself, with some of the spices and butters to give it that extra char.The meat is prime, and with little effort, and a lot of fun, especially if you’ve been fortifying yourself with some good ‘ol bar drinks before you started cooking, you sit down to a terrific meal. Actually, the meat is so good, that I would recommend just giving it a little dusting of salt and pepper, and let the steak do the rest.As I said, it’s a small salad bar, but filled with very fresh veggies and other assorted goodies, and is an all-you-can eat. So you can feast on a roll and salad, and a stiff drink before your meat arrives, and then make another rush to the salad bar when your steak is finished.The prices are reasonable. This is a family run business. Over sixty years in this location. The owner, a fascinating gentleman who has traveled the world and been involved in all kinds of creative endeavors, from Hollywood, to rock music to magic, took over from his father. To him, this is his life. It is part of his family, and his pride for the place shows not only in the atmosphere he creates, but in the people who work with him, and the regulars who have been coming here for years. At night, actually one of the most popular aspects is Karaoke. You don’t have to cook a steak. You can stay, if you like, in the main bar, and relive a time when no one could text you, when the news made you happy, and when we didn’t have to cringe every time a faux-president opens his mouth. Yes, this is truly a “go-to” destination. And not to worry if you’re not an Iron Chef. The owner or any of the bar help or waiters’ are more than happy to guide you through the grilling process from start to finish.By the way, this is a bar and restaurant, not an attraction. I hope that TripAdvisor corrects this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heywoodf307
40,"Unique Experience, Decent quality meats","For $15, you get a piece of steak, all you can eat salad, a baked potato, and a bread roll. The steak is pretty good quality. The catch? You get to cook your own steak. They have a seasoning bar then you put it on the grill. You can also make your own garlic roll with some garlic seasoning and butter. Venice Room isn't your typically restaurant or bbq place. Its actually a bar with a small eating area off to the side. Service is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leep116
40,Cook your own steaks,"I enjoyed myself. I can never get my steaks like I want them, so when you cook it yourself, it's just right. Lots of marinade. Salad, baked potatoes, bread, really tender steaks, good sized. A dive, yes, but a very pleasant older established dive. Went there for my retirement party. Staff, especially our server was a lovely young woman who brought everything quickly. Go for lunch and it's a few dollars off $15. Want great steaks and no nonsense? Go to the Venice room. There is also a bar. All was clean and neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
30,Disappointed.,Old casual restaurant (needed some decorating help) in which you cook your own steaks. It was noisy because their bar was around the corner and the TV on. The help was not smiling and seemed like they didn't want to be there. Had driven by the restaurant for years and finally decided to try it out but was dissappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686robertn
