50,A must-visit,"Hollywood Bowl is at the heart of so many adventures for myself and my boyfriend! What else do you need with music under the stars, and a picnic in one of the most scenic venues in the world. Also wonderful for larger outings with family or friends. The programming is diverse so whatever your interests, there is most likely a welcome option. Highly recommend.",ACNathan
50,This is one incredible venue!,We were fascinated to see the Hollywood Bowl from top to bottom. Make sure you make plans well in advance for tickets to a concert and parking/transportation options. Allow enough time for traffic. No need for bringing food as the dining experience here is excellent.,crunch6
40,Great venue,I went there about Sept of 2018 when I was in town for a wedding. I liked it a lot. The staff was very helpful and it was a fun time. I will be going back soon,mikegia
50,The MUST DO Los Angeles Experience!!,"The Hollywood Bowl is easily the BEST experience in Los Angeles.Of course, which show you see depends on your interest....but there's everything on the performance calendar, so find a show that's of interest and GO!!It's pure magic, and the venue experience alone uplifts the heart and every performance.I've always been confused by which shows you can take your own alcohol, but it seems like most of them; you'll see the info when you buy tickets. People load up on the beverages and food to self cater, but it's actually quite reasonable to buy onsite, and/or dine at the venue restaurants (but must make reservations), which are excellent. The ""Supper in your Seats"" is certainly the easiest way to go.If you have not been before, parking is the least fun part of the experience, as with anything related to cars in Los Angeles. Just remember, patience is a virtue. You can also park down the road at the Hollywood & Highland center (Academy Awards location, as well), and take a walk up the road. I'm too lazy for that, or maybe it's because I'm hauling too many bottles of wine into the Bowl with my pals and I:)In short....just GO! Even the cheap seats are great fun! It's a lifetime memory.",leigh732 Los Angeles
50,Fantastic Musical Experience,Visited the Hollywood Bowl to watch Vampire Weekend. The whole venue is so unique and like nothing else I've experienced around the World. We were seated really far back but that didn't make any difference. The atmosphere was electric. The only little complaint I have is how long the drinks line was and how expensive the drinks were.,Charlie J
50,Very Special and unique!,"The Hollywood Bowl is one of my favorite places to listen to a concert during the summer months in LA. We usually arrive at the amphitheater area for an early picnic before the concert begins. After the picnic we walk to the amphitheater on foot and grab our seats. The atmosphere in the Hollywood Bowl is always great, no matter what concert they play. Hollywood Bowl is the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the host venue to hundreds of musical events each year since 1922. Great place!",Gonen2014
50,Iconic,"Loved visiting this venue, met so many interesting people. Got some souvenirs at the gift shop, had a hot drink but they don’t have milk available, strange . Hollywood Bowl is on a hill but there are escalators there if walking is difficult. We hired seat cushions for a dollar and glad we did as we arrived at 2.30 to see Kanye West at 4 pm. The show didn’t start till 6.30 which was badly run as there was nothing happening in the 2 1/2 hr wait. Apparently he is known for running late so why was there no back up or better planning.When the opera started we were disappointed that the big screens weren’t on. The show was meant to last a few hours but finished after 50 minutes. It was opera but not as we know it. To get a standing ovation he got us all to stand up and praise the Lord and then the cast took a bow. It was unbelievable, it was my birthday and I wouldn’t have missed it for the world, unforgettable 😂 he must have been laughing all the way to the bank.Loved the whole experience in a strange way 🤔",Nomad5522
50,WHAT AN INCREDIBLE VENUE!,My first visit to the Hollywood bowl and I had a spectacular time ! I went to see a concert . I have to say just sitting in the seats and taking in the beautiful hills and palm trees in the background was amazing. We had great service in our box . We were able to bring our own food for a picnic. For this event however you could not bring in beverages. That really wasn’t a problem we just bought bottles of wine there. I can’t wait to go back!!,Paige
50,Happiness tour,"Had great seating! The entry to the concert was not long or hard. It has a lot of spots to get food and beverages, but be ready to pay an arm and a leg! Seating was great! Lots of surprise fireworks, confetti, glitter and they even had fire!",Dianna Z
50,A Gorgeous Venue with Great Sound!,"We saw The Who with an orchestra. Everything sounded great! The sight lines and seating areas are quality. We paid all of $1 for a cushion. Concessions, access, and overall beauty of the venue is wonderful. Walking back down the hill was difficult mostly due to two knucklehead employees who closed access and then only partially opened it. It was a kind of brain dead thing to do. I was so happy to have finally attended a show at this legendary venue.",denverroadtrip
50,What an experience,"I was taken here to see ""an American in Paris"" with a live orchestra, by friends. First thing, take a cushion, or hire on for a buck. The seats are had and the performances can be long.Secondly, there are a lot of steps, thinkabout that if you are less ambulant.The film, with the live orchestra was simply amazing. Seeing the famous searchlights overhead, and the planes flying over was a memory I will always remember.The car park can be a bit hectic and it might take a while to vacate, but just sit back, chill and relax. I did.What a night.",Surveyor47
40,Impressive venue!,My husband and I traveled to LA to see the Game of Thrones concert & it was quite the experience at the Hollywood Bowl! The Bowl accommodates a LOT of people. It’s a good idea to arrive early. We spent 20+ minutes in line just to get through security and into the Bowl. So glad the had escalators if you didn’t want to walk all the way to the top. Food lines were very long but some gave you mobile order options. There are also seat cushions rentals available for $1. We didn’t get the seat cushions and didn’t find the seats that uncomfortable - just wooden bench seats. Very easy to hear and see & quite enjoyable.,Jess R
30,Great concert,"My mum and I have never visited the Hollywood bowl but thought it would be an amazing experience to go to see rod Stewart there. The concert was great (Jeff beck only did a couple songs and rod didn’t do an encore) the bowl itself looks impressive. The staff are helpful. The food isn’t so good. Don’t get vegetarian tacos they’re awful. The fries and popcorn were expensive but good. You can rent a cushion for $1 do that. We caught a cab there which was a good idea. Leave before the concert ends or you’ll face hell on earth like we did. I cannot explain how much hell it was getting out of that place, there was a stampede it was crowded, disorganised, really quite scary. Eventually after about an hour of absolute carnage we managed to get out by walking and caught a cab back to the hotel. Honestly hell on earth getting out of that place. Seriously needs to be looked at really terrible. And marijuana was been smoked all around us even during the concert. Wouldn’t go back there. But was an experience. Shame as the place is kinda cool",Lauz R
50,Great Concert Venue,"Not only is the area beautiful but this venue offers great concert opportunities, where one can see from all the seats which is a real plus. Most of the venue is stadium seating but you can rent a seat cushion for $1...a real bargain. You are allowed to bring in your own food and drinks including adult beverages, that way you eat and drink what you choose. Most of the people are friendly and warm but there's always a few exceptions. Every city should have a place that's is as easy to get in and out of. There is a lot of walking so dress accordingly. If you're from out of town and have opportunity to enjoy a concert here take advantage of it.",LPF
50,One of my favorite places,"While living in Los Angeles from 1975-1990, I had season tickets. I am now living in the bay area but at least once a year go down to the Bowl for a concert. Last year was the Tchaikovsky Spectacular (one of the best) and this year we saw Beethoven's 9th Symphony. I live this place!!!!",ChowMom@sbcglobal.net
40,Amazing auditorium - wonderful atmosphere,We planned to visit the bowl for an evening concert and were both absolutely blown away by the magnificence of the arena. We arrived at about 6:30 pm and so it was still light and we had a view not only of the whole arena but also the Hollywood Sign in the distance behind the stage. We took a picnic as is allowed and promoted by the bowl and then enjoyed a wonderful concert and a great evening experience. I wore tee shirt and shorts and the evening was warm up until about 10 pm when a simple fleece jacket is all that was needed. We used Park and Ride from Culver city which once we found the pick up point was great method of getting to the venue. Only thing that stops a 5* isthe absolute shambles at the end of the concert with regards to the bus back to Culver city really they should sort it out urgently.,Ed D
40,Barry Manilow Concert,"Loved the show, had wonderful pre-show picnic with three couples and our teenage son up in the top observation level. Only drawback was a bad pre-made salad from the bbq and taco stand. The tacos were a hit, and the bbq pulled pork sandwich was terrific. The salad wasn’t fresh, not enough dressing (no extra dressing available), and just lacked flavor all the way around. Got some caramel popcorn for dessert that was tasty, and a few over-priced bottles of water from the market place. The key to dining there might be bring your drinks, get the tacos and bbq, and avoid the salad!",PaulG13

50,Great Outdoor Concert Venue,"Went for a concert while visiting LA and I can say that it is an awesome place to see a show. Great setting and the sound was excellent. I have 2 comments about the venue. 1). I'm surprised you're allowed to have bottles of booze there. The people sitting behind us dropped a bottle of wine and glass went everywhere and hit the back of my child. No injury, but people are going to get loaded and drop bottles, so was surprised by that. 2). If you take an Uber/Lyft it's a bit of a disaster trying to leave. They funnel all the risdshare traffic into one small area and traffic gets backed up. Took close to an hour to secure a ride home. Putting those items aside I still would go see another show there without hesitation.",Zman71868

The fireworks display that corresponded to the performing of the 1812 Overture was an event to remember. The Bowl is a sensational facility; we were 2/3 of the way to the back, section M2. It was easy to hear and there are four giant screens to assist the visual experience. But the layout of the Bowl is amazing; set in a natural bowl in the mountains, it's a beautiful piece of work. And from our seats, you could also see the Hollywood sign in the background. Great evening.",MMB3828
50,One of the best inventions in L.A.,"If the Hollywood Bowl had not yet been invented, it would have to be immediately. This is such a landmark L.A. place, regardless of the type and nature of the event. Whether it is classical music, film music, Chopin, Carlos Santana, or Jazz, or you name it, it is such gorgeous way to take it in under the free sky. Every aspect is fantastic and kudos to the patient organizers and staff who remarkably efficiently process the masses of patrons – to get them to their box or seat, to offer dinner or quick bites at the Market Place or at any of the other food options (which one could also bring from home) … I’m always excited to go there!!Tip 1: Parking right there is not recommended; tip 2: even in the summer, it can turn remarkably cold …; and tip 3: if the sun still shines, this is a nice way to get sunburned…(Originally posted by me on yelp)",AMKaiser
10,Petty Power,"Went to the Hollywood Bowl last night. I'm not a visitor from out of town. I've been going to the Bowl for FIFTY years! The cooler I used last night is the same one I've used for at least ten years. I have two subscriptions, so I'm there a dozen or more times per season. Same cooler. Year after year. Last night, someone was standing there with a TAPE MEASURE and informed me that my cooler was 1/4 in ""too tall,"" so I couldn't bring it in. Dinner was inside that cooler, along with wine, water, cutlery, etc. They sent for a supervisor, who said that ""the rules"" are posted online. At the risk of being redundant, this cooler has never been challenged in the past. Foolishly, I asked why? I was told that it's a ""safety hazard."" How? It won't fit in the box. There were two of us in a box for four. I could have brought a microwave and a fridge and still had room. If there's heightened security because of the recent domestic terrorism, then tell me that I will no longer be allowed to bring the cooler. Instead, they left us to try to figure out how to get plates, glasses, food, etc. into the venue in tiny, ineffective plastic bags. I'd have to look at my tax records to see if my donation this year was $2500 or $3500 (I forget which), but that little exercise in petty power just cost them my donation.",LATraveller77
20,"Great place for music, just don't order drinks at your seat","Went to the bowl for a recent concert. Parking at the bowl is stacked so we always park at a lot and shuttle in.We were in the pool circle and you have menus on your seat when you arrive. I tried to flag down 3 servers to place an order. One even looked at me and held up a finger and mouthed one minute before walking off the other way.

Every aspect is fantastic and kudos to the patient organizers and staff who remarkably efficiently process the masses of patrons – to get them to their box or seat, to offer dinner or quick bites at the Market Place or at any of the other food options (which one could also bring from home) … I’m always excited to go there!!Tip 1: Parking right there is not recommended; tip 2: even in the summer, it can turn remarkably cold …; and tip 3: if the sun still shines, this is a nice way to get sunburned…(Originally posted by me on yelp)",AMKaiser
10,Petty Power,"Went to the Hollywood Bowl last night. I'm not a visitor from out of town. I've been going to the Bowl for FIFTY years! The cooler I used last night is the same one I've used for at least ten years. I have two subscriptions, so I'm there a dozen or more times per season. Same cooler. Year after year. Last night, someone was standing there with a TAPE MEASURE and informed me that my cooler was 1/4 in ""too tall,"" so I couldn't bring it in. Dinner was inside that cooler, along with wine, water, cutlery, etc. They sent for a supervisor, who said that ""the rules"" are posted online. At the risk of being redundant, this cooler has never been challenged in the past. Foolishly, I asked why? I was told that it's a ""safety hazard."" How? It won't fit in the box. There were two of us in a box for four. I could have brought a microwave and a fridge and still had room. If there's heightened security because of the recent domestic terrorism, then tell me that I will no longer be allowed to bring the cooler. Instead, they left us to try to figure out how to get plates, glasses, food, etc. into the venue in tiny, ineffective plastic bags. I'd have to look at my tax records to see if my donation this year was $2500 or $3500 (I forget which), but that little exercise in petty power just cost them my donation.",LATraveller77
20,"Great place for music, just don't order drinks at your seat","Went to the bowl for a recent concert. Parking at the bowl is stacked so we always park at a lot and shuttle in.We were in the pool circle and you have menus on your seat when you arrive. I tried to flag down 3 servers to place an order. One even looked at me and held up a finger and mouthed one minute before walking off the other way. I will not return to the bowl, there are more convenient concert venues with better service.",gameluver

50,Amazing Place,"Amazing! Second visit, this time for a Cyndi Lauper concert. As long as special house rules aren’t applied, you can bring in your own food, beer, and/or wine. Check their calendar to ensure your event isn’t listed as “Special House Rules Apply”. Don’t forget drink ware and a bottle opener for your wine!Consider bringing a jacket or blanket, even in the summer. Unless there’s a heat wave, it can get a bit chilly once the sun sets behind the mountains.Take Metro to the Hollywood & Highland station. It’s a short walk but much better than driving.",Michael M
50,Hugh Jackman at the Bowl,"I haven’t been to the Bowl for years. It is still a fabulous place. You feel like you’re out in a forest with 17,500 of your friends enjoying a memorable performance. I would advise no one to drive there. Traffic and parking are a nightmare. I took a park and ride bus from Lakewood. You can order tickets for the bus at $7 per person and let someone else face the torture of the freeways on a Friday night. Once you enter the Bowl you pass several places to buy food or eat your picnic. Many folks eat in their seats. The show we saw was Hugh Jackman and it was a sellout. He is a consummate performer and puts on a fantastic show. I would recommend taking binoculars and a seat cushion as the Bowl is quite large and the benches aren’t very comfortable. There are some video screens so you can get a good look at the show. I’ve been to many classical concerts at the Bowl and acoustics are good. Remember it’s all uphill to get to your seats and a steep walk down later.",LindainLakewood
50,Must experience!,"If you love live music and outdoor venues, this is a must. The acoustics are superb, the seating is comfortable (similar to wooden park benches with backs).There are food stalls and a restaurant but you are allowed to bring food and drinks.Allow plenty of time for travel/parking/walking before and after. 17,500 people arriving and leaving at the same time can leave roads congested!",Netster11
50,Outdoor Music High,"The largest open air amphitheater in the US?! It’s awesome.

50,Tuesday night concert...,"The Los Angeles Philharmonic was playing Carnival of the Animals, by Camille Saint-Sean’s, Jaunjo Mena, Conductor. The two soloists on piano were Katia and Marielle Labeque. This was a series of very short and sometimes vibrant pieces reflecting an animal in Symphonic form. Some of the ones I thought best were The Swan, a Cello solo by Robert deMaine. This was an elegant, slow moving and expressive Swan. Kangaroos, to watch the pianos played with arm movements that looked like Kangaroos hoping along the keyboard, was a delight. Tortoises, what else, but a plodding and straight forward and deliberate piece. Pianists, a piece set up Sean Hayes, the host for this work, as a serious one. Turned out to make a lot of musicians. We could see several Orchestra members looking as if they could not believe they were taking part in this. After the intermission, Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz was next. The Horn section came on stage as well a 3 Timpani. This was an exciting and loud work. It worked, it was a labor of thrills. The Bowl has stacked parking, we went to lot A, highest of all on the hill. An escalator is provided to take you down to your seats and back up the parking lot after. We had brought a picnic dinner and a small area was contained 4 tables in a very convenient location. Spoke with several others who had the same idea, and one who it turned out went to the same barber I did in Costa Mesa. Small World....",James Weaver

40,"Fabulous Place To See A Concert, Parking is The Worst.","We have been to the Hollywood Bowl many times. It is beautiful. Located near the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood Sign, it seems it is craved out into the hills. It is so pretty.The place is pretty big, so there are bad seats. There are seats so bad you can not see much of the stage, so keep that in mind. The boxes are the best, but pricey. The boxes are seats of 4 each with a table in the middle and surrounded in wood. You can bring your dinner and enjoy. Behind the boxes are rows of seats, some great, some pretty bad. Behind that are the bench seats and none of them are good. They are just too far back, but they are pretty cheap so I have sat there when on a strict budget.Parking at the Bowl is the worst. It is just awful. It is stacked parking and good luck getting out and on the road even 45 minutes after the concert ends and no you will not be leaving early if you are in stacked parking. There is other parking to be had, but there is not a lot. Some restaurants will give you parking and shuttle you there if you eat there. All in all, parking is not going to ever be a good time.The sound at the Bowl is great. You are able to hear, even in the back. The stage is beautiful. It is all outdoors. There are a few places to get food and you can eat it there or take to your seats. You can bring in your own food and you can even bring in wine. If I were you I would get there early if you really want to enjoy a meal and relax before the show.Most shows end by 11:30 pm because of the homes nearby. They also tend to start on time.Another issue with the Bowl is the long walk to your seats, up ramps, up stairs, down stairs. If you have issues with walking it can be a real pain. It is a long walk.The Bowl is just beautiful though and we always go back. Despite its issues, the concerts there are great. If you ever get a chance to go there when they have fireworks, do that. Have a great time.",elizabethlascheid
50,Great Venue,"Lived here my entire life, seen many concerts and had never been to the Hollywood Bowl. Came across a Groupon for a concert and thought here’s my chance. Took a Lyft from hotel and was dropped off super close. The vibe was awesome. People were tailgating outside in the casual atmosphere. We got to the top for our entry gate, had no issue with security and entered facility. Purchased a bottle of wine (cool) and a sweatshirt. Made the incredibly steep trek to our seat. The iconic Bowl’s shell-like structure and amphitheater is a must see venue. The view is just incredible. The concert was great. Good thing I brought binoculars. Crowd was friendly and not obnoxious. The con is leaving the facility. We ordered a Lyft and if it wasn’t for GPS we would have never found it, but we did and all was well. Will definitely return however will purchase better seats.",menhb
50,An evening with Andrea Bocelli,"It was a fabulous evening under a low cloud cover with great music. It would have been a perfect evening if not for the traffic and parking nightmare an evening at the bowl represents. We even tried using a shuttle from the Dolby center- but they were running 45 minutes behind! Allow LOTS of extra time before the concert begins to park and get to the venue. Otherwise, what a great theater! I had not been there in over 40 years!!! It has changed, and all for the better. The escalators are a good perk. They even have kind of a 711 store where you can buy a can or beer or wine, a bag of chips, candy, etc.",Karen R
10,A great venue some years ago has turned into an absolute crap,"We've been to Hollywood Bowl many times, and used to like the place. But it has turned into an absolute crap. The parking lots (Lot B and others) close to the Bowl that used to be available on a first come basis, now only available for people who purchase passes online. The traffic is horrendous. It has always been bad, but it was moving. Now it literally DOESN'T move. Expect putting your car into ""Park"" while in traffic and spend about 50 min. to get through the last 0.5 miles to the Bowl. Oh, and BTW you CAN NOT bring a basket with wine and snacks with you anymore. Instead you are now forced to buy unedible overpriced crap. BEWARE: You can't even bring in wine and food, that you purchased on their plaza, but before you go through metal detectors. BTW: the lines through the metal detectors are a total joke: disorganized and the attendants seems to be asleep. Also note, that the Bowl keep changing the ""rules"", but it's impossible to find information in advance. So after spending at least 2 hours on getting to the fricking place - you can be told something at entrance that you didn't count on. Like ""you can't have bottle opener with you"" (yes, not the Swiss knife, but a portable bottle opener). But of course you can go back and check it in at the desk and then spend another 40 min. getting bac - What a bunch of clowns!!! Needless to say that you have a good chance to have your evening ruined. In my humble opinion, the Bowl has become an absolute disaster, simply the worst venue in Los Angeles. Go to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (LA Opera), Staples Center or Disney Hall. You will enjoy it much better!",Emil L
50,Iconic Venue - Tips and Tricks,"Do not park at the Bowl! If you are from out of town, your best bet is to stay at a local hotel and walk to the venue, or take the metro and walk to the venue, or take ridesharing and walk to the venue. In most of the Bowl lots, cars are parked in stacks of 6 or more so it can take hours to get out.If you are local, the best option is to take a park and ride bus from one of the park and ride lots in various locations. Those bus tickets are inexpensive and can be bought in advance or just before getting on the bus.Once inside the venue, there are several good food choices, although lines are long and prices are high as you would expect for a concert venue. If you are sitting in the expensive seats, you can pre-order fine dining in advance or order from a menu after arriving.",Eric G
40,Iconic venue.,"Iconic venue and a LA happening before the show.Most shows, even the lame movie nights or plays sellout due to the picnicking scene. ( not designed for theatre performances nor movies).Finally gave up season tickets due to declining performers ( see movie nights above). Now I go for specific independent concerts.Always scalped tiks available online.Decent acoustics—not great. Average and overpriced foods available.Pool, garden or terrace boxes for 4 or 6 people. Bench seating further up the hill.Horrible parking—don’t do stacked parking! I always park down the hill (street or public garages).",Summerasalifestyle
40,I am so glad that we decided to visit,"The setting, bandshell, lighting and sound were excellent.We took a shuttle from the LA Zoo and were dropped off near the entrance. The gates weren't opened yet and the masses of people were worse than any other venue I've ever been to.We were told that we had 30 minutes after the show ended to make it back to our bus, which didn't seem like enough time considering the crowd.Our instructions to find the return bus were ""stay to the left all of the way out, go through the tunnel and take the first stairs on the right"". Staying to the left didn't lead to the tunnel, so we had to climb through a fence. The tunnel was almost a stampede. But we found our bus.I lost my phone and gave the operations office a number to call if it was found. When I called them in the morning, it had miraculously been turned it.I absolutely loved the concert and being at the iconic Hollywood Bowl, however crowd control inside and outside was totally lacking and annoying.A HUGE thank you to the kind folks (are you from Ojai?) who turned in my phone!",eusnna
30,"Great venue, horrible entry/exit","I attended the Mixtape Concert on Sunday, May 26th. The venue is absolutely amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed the concert.HOWEVER, the process of entering and exiting is horrendous! I traveled from Indiana to attend the concert with my sister and was mind-boggled by this disaster!We arrived at about 6:00 since the concert tickets stated that the concert begins promptly at 7:00 with the main act. At 7:00 there were thousands of people still standing outside waiting to get in. I have never been to a concert that entry was such a disaster!! We finally got in at 7:30 and thankfully the concert didn't begin promptly at 7:00 otherwise they would've had 1000s of unhappy concert goers. Exiting the venue was just as crazy!!",Jamie M
50,Little Mermaid 30th!,"We had a night I will never forget here! Sure a lot of that is due to the event itself (getting to be 3 rows away from the man who wrote the music of my childhood, Alan Menken, at the Little Mermaid 30th Concert). However, I have been to outdoor venues in my home town and not had as good a time as I had here.It was really easy to walk here from our hotel on Hollywood Blvd. I wouldn’t suggest driving/ubering/public transit since that seemed like a mess. But walking was a fun way to meet other people, felt safe because tons of people walk as well, and you get your exercise! It took no time at all to get through security and find our seats. The place is huge but we never got lost! We were in the pool section which was fantastic for getting up close with the performers but it was a bummer to totally miss the projections of the show or the movie on the giant screen. That is a trade off you will have to decide on. I wouldn’t trade what we had but it is worth noting. The price of the tickets was also super fair considering how much it costs us to sit that close in places like Vegas. Also worth mentioning that it does get cold so layers and blankets are a must! If they do another round of Disney live to film shows we plan on returning!",Christine S

50,Early birds get the best out of it,"I just went to see Arctic Monkeys. Since I had to pick up my tickets with Will Call and I didn't know how bad it could get with parking and the crowds, I though we could grab food and get there three hours before the concert for a pick-nick and to watch the sunset. Our original plan was to park on Korea Town where we were staying with a friend and ride our bikes to the venue (40 mins) since I read terrible parking related reviews. Due to traffic we could not follow that plan so my panicked butt and my husband and I went directly to the venue, 1.5 hours before the concert started.For parking, please follow this SUPER PRO TIP: Park at Venice Lot for FREE and take right outside the bus ride to the entrance. Its a $6 round ticket that you buy right there. Due to this we got in and out very easy and there was no fuzz at all.Please, don´t be like me and take food with you, that way you can spend only on beer and a t-shirt :). Check the rules of your event before deciding taking wine with you, as everybody seems to believe that you can do that whatever event you are attending to.Having said all of that, I must say that the staff is very well trained, the food is pretty decent and the restrooms are clean and most importantly, enough- I did´t have to stay in line once-. The seats on the cheaper areas have no cushion so I do recommend renting one for one dollar. You are worth it.For this particularly concert 1.5 hours before the starting time was enough to avoid crowds, lines and to buy food, eat it while it was hot and get beer. We were sitting at our seats at 7:00 o`clock. We were leaving the parking lot on our car 40 minutes after the concert was over.",Monyta F
50,Finally made it!,"I am a mega-music fan who grew up on the East Coast - just outside of NYC, to be exact. So, I've visited some of the most iconic venues in the world (Radio City, MSG). I hadn't visited LA in about 15 years, and surprisingly didn't get to the iconic Hollywood Bowl back then. My husband & I moved to Phoenix a few months ago, and when we saw Beck would be performing at the Hollywood Bowl, we got tickets. We drove out and stayed very close to the bowl - so close, in fact, that we were able to walk there and back. While I'm still partial to my NYC venues only because I know them like the back of my hand, visiting the Hollywood Bowl was a truly amazing experience! It was everything we envisioned and then some! The bowl simply has this aura and mystique about it. You have to see it to believe it! We'll be back!",Mdgrl79
50,Incredible venue but plan your trip carefully,"First visit. We were excited to go but knew that getting in and out could be a problem. Glad to find out that there were ""park and ride"" options to the venue. We took the 6:00 bus out of Santa Monica and it took two hours to get to the place due to traffic. Apparently the driver had to follow a specific routing (maybe suggested by the company) to get there as my daughter thought that there were faster ways to go other than getting stuck on I-10 until we headed north.That being said, the venue is a great location for a natural amphitheater. Lots and lots of seats (all of them from my vantage point towards the stage had seat backs), adequate restrooms, food and beverage and great ushers to help you get around.The drive back on the bus was much better - about 40 minutes. You get to your bus that is lined up in a close-in parking lot and leave when it is full. I can recommend the bus but be aware of how late you leave - you may miss some of the performance if you don't leave early enough.",m2swim
50,Great outdoor natural amphitheatre in Hollywood for concerts,"The only bad thing is the traffic at the Hollywood Bowl exit on 101. Avoid that and walk from Hollywood and highland. Many people do. Fantastic concessions including upscale restaurants with patios. The slope wasn't too steep. The sound was amazing. Not too loud, but the Hollywood Hills behind the bandshell form an even larger scale natural bandshell and makes the sound Fuller and richer. Everyone seemed happy and mellow and having a good time.",Rocky Road
50,Excellent jazz,We were a little concerned that the jazz might be just a little too relaxing and we would fall asleep. Not true at all. The Lincoln Orchestra was very creative. They chose the theme of animals. They were very clever and beautiful at performing animal sounds with their music. And then they had dancers to dance to the animal theme songs. It was really one of the best jazz performances we have ever seen.,PilotMichael
50,Amazing venue!,"Came here with family (adult family members) for the Sound of Music Sing Along & WOW was I impressed! The venue is INCREDIBLE!

The venue was one of the best we've ever been to for sound quality and comfort. We had been advised to take the Hollywood Bowl Shuttles and not try to park at the venue, and we are very glad we did that. Less stress and met some great people on the bus ride over while having dinner and drinks. The next time we are in town we want to return to explore the venue when there is not an event and then return for another concert.",Josh_WG_FL
50,Absolutely stunning,We were so thrilled to get tickets for a show whilst staying in LA. We had the most wonderful time for an incredibly low ticket price. We took the shuttle rather than experiencing the stack parking and that worked great. Food was good there and we were so surprised that we could take our own wine and beer. An unforgettable experience at a wonderful Harry Conick Jnr concert.,Karen C
50,Oustanding Acoustics,"We attended and enjoyed the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in the Hollywood Bowl. The acoustics in this open air theater are amazing. If possible, everyone should experience a musical show in the Hollywood Bowl if possible. Our seats were were a box, with two small folding tables and four chairs. We brought alcoholic refreshments (wine) to enjoy into the Hollywood Bowl. What you are allowed to bring to the Hollywood Bowl depends on the type of show you are attending (the web site has all the restrictions). We also were allowed to bring in or buy food for dinner, but we did not. All in all, we enjoyed a great evening.",adventurer1234
50,Unlike and amazing venue,"When we visit LA, this is always a highlight. We buy box tickets for a concert and order dinner. You do this via internet from the 3 or 4 choices offered. When you are seated, the space is tight but the atmosphere is very friendly. Dinner is served well presented, with very good service, and very good food. You can bring your own wine or buy the bottle there. —You can also choose to bring your own picnic, or prepared food. No obligation to purchase anything there. After, you can enjoy the live music while eating your dessert and finishing your wine.Perfect!!",50Beatrizy
50,Our own Bowl,"I am still fairly new to the Hollywood Bowl, however some of us have been attending for many years. This was the first time for us to be attending together without the entourage of family and other guests. We were up in the “cheap seats” which was a bit of a change from Box seats before, but the energy and connection of these seats was much more intimate and enervating.John Williams is always a fantastic show and we always look forward to it. What we had not known was that this was the 40th Anniversary and Stephen Spielberg was the guest MC. Yowza!!!!So good and so huge - as always. I think my favorite part was when Stephen played the circus chase scene from Indiana Jones III - first without music (oddly boring and dragging), then with the orchestra providing the soundtrack and I, once again, realized how important and significant music is to the emotional experience of movies.Great pre-show meal, probably too much wine, a spectacular show and time with the woman of my dreams. Priceless!",Schoolier
50,Great Venue for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.,"We saw the 40th Anniversary celebration of John Williams, Maestro at the Movies. The program was great. The sound was tremendous. The TV Screens helped to either see the concert or the movie pieces that John Williams' music accompanied.",Donald C
50,Bucket list item did not disappoint,"What a place! Regardless of what kind of show is playing, if you have a chance to go, or even just to visit the overlook when there is not a show, do it!Found out in advance of a trip (via Pollstar.com) that LA Philharmonic had a Tuesday night concert here so we got tickets and went.As a frequent concert goer since 1974, this was truly a bucket list venue for me and as soon as I sat down I was blown away. Then the sunset progressed and it was even more beautiful. Oh, and then the concert started. Sound was great and the orchestra and choirs were spectacular.We sat in section G9, which is the center above the box seats, actual seats and not benches. I’d recommend this highly. I didn’t feel the extra cost of box seats would be necessary, but that the upgrade to the chairs would be worth it. I was right; comfortable and great sight lines in the center of the bowl - you can rent or bring cushions if you like. Another great feature for this show (but not all shows) is that you can bring beverages in, so we shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed a terrific evening I’ll never forget.",Christopher C
50,Savion Glover and Gregory Porter - Inspired!,"It was an evening out with my daughter who had been there before and wanted to share the experience with me and it was a wonderful evening out. Perfect! Both performers are outstanding and did not disappoint. Savion Glover's performance was powerful, dramatic, energetic and awe inspiring Porter has earned his reputation as a jazz performer and his tribute to Nat King Cole is inspired. Absolutely wonderful. I loved the outdoor venue and was happy to get reasonably (for the HB) priced seats (approx. $75 each) that allowed us a good view of the stage (I followed previous reviews that said look for seats no further than D, E, F, G, H. I could not afford the 200 to 300 $ tickets and was not disappointed.",P B
50,"Great Location, So Fun to See an Event Here","I saw Annie here and it was amazing. Any seat in the place would be a good location, they have massive TV screens on each side of the theater. The sound was amazing and lighting was on par. I would definitely recommend seeing any performance here. It is definitely a family friendly atmosphere. There are food options to purchase, along with wine options on site. Also the Lyft pickup area is very easy to navigate.",Love2TravelUS
50,West Coast at Its Best,"There is nothing like sitting at the Hollywood Bowl at the end of a warm summer day, as the sun sets behind the Hollywood Hills, and the temperature starts to drop. The music begins, and surrounded by 17,000 or so of your closest friends, you can feel the magic begin.On the other hand, there are the downsides: Miserable traffic, horrible parking, and an audience who sometimes cares more about eating, drinking, talking and selfies than the performance.A lot of Angelinos *hate* the Hollywood Bowl. They won't go there for any reason. I'm here to help you not end up like them. I have been a Bowl subscriber for over 15 years. Below is my review, with helpful tips for having a good Bowl experience. (See the Bowl's website for shuttle lot addresses, menus, etc.)ParkingBy far, the easiest way in and out is to take one of the Bowl Shuttles. It’s easy parking, and so worth avoiding the stack parking at the Bowl itself. Parking is free, and the Shuttle is $6 per person. Some shuttle lots may stack park if they get full. The Bowl this season has improved its ride-share access. Taking Lyft or Uber to the Bowl is easy, but be warned: Getting out can be a hassle. Another option is to walk about a mile to the Metro Red Line station at Hollywood and Highland, where you can take a train to either Downtown LA, or the Valley. The walk can seem a lot longer at the end of a long evening, when you've had a bit of wine, and the sidewalks are six-deep with other people trying to get to the station at once.Start TimeIf you are meeting with friends, meet your party at the Shuttle lot two hours before the performance starts That puts you on the first shuttle, and get you to the Bowl in time for dinner before the show. (Gates open 90 minutes before show time.)DiningFor Philharmonic-sponsored events, you are allowed to bring your own food and drink - including alcohol. For ""Lease Events,"" you cannot bring anything. Lease Events are usually the bigger pop/rock concerts. Check the Bowl's website if you aren't sure. It may also state it on your tickets. (Lease Events are marked on the Bowl Calendar as ""Special House Rules."")There are several picnic areas both within the Bowl gates and just outside the venue. They fill up early, so plan to arrive 90 minutes to two hours early to find a seat… especially if you have a large group. You can bring your own food and a bottle of wine, and just relax. Some of the picnic areas have fantastic views of L.A. Note that they are all pretty rustic, and the tables can be dusty, covered with pine needles, etc. Bring a tablecloth in your picnic basket.If you have box seats, it is great to dine in your box. Meals are priced equivalent to fine-dining restaurants - expect as much as $100 per person, plus tip, excluding alcohol (because you will bring your own). I recommend the three-course dinners, and the family-style dining. If you aren't really hungry, you can probably share a three-course dinner, and the family style meals can easily feed four, especially if you supplement with food from home. The ala carte selections are also good, if you want to mix and match. However, I would avoid the picnic boxes, as they aren’t very satisfying, and don’t include table service (though they are a bit less expensive!). The three-course dinners include complimentary water. The Bowl's one sit-down restaurant, The Back Yard, is really good, and has stepped up a notch over the past few years, but it can be hard to get reservations once you get into the season. It's also about $100/person.The fast food around the Bowl is adequate. Although it's much less expensive than the dining options, it feels overpriced and isn't particularly good. The Marketplace store has better options, and feels somewhat higher quality.Sushi at the Bowl is provided by Kikka, which makes sushi for many markets in town. It's adequate, but about what you might expect in terms of quality. It is fresh, at least.ShoppingThe Bowl stores have some surprisingly reasonable prices: You can get a nice straw hat for as little as $20, which is nice when you find out your seat is under the blazing sun. You can get a souvenir corkscrew for less than $10, which is nice when you have brought a bottle of wine and have no way to open it. There are also, of course, overpriced touristy gewgaws.People-WatchingThe best. You will occasionally see celebrities. There are all manner of LA boho, art-freaks, rich old people, Beautiful People, college kids, families, and just plain old music lovers. One of the reasons to arrive early is to enjoy the show before the show. However, all these diverse, wild, eclectic people come with a cost: Rudeness. They will often talk, loudly, and exuberantly, through the entire performance, especially for opening acts. It's somewhat better for Classical and Jazz performances than for other genres, but be prepared to be annoyed, especially in the box seats.SeatingFor Philharmonic events, you can still get tickets up in the ""nose-bleed"" section for $11. At the other end of the scale, Pool Circle seats, which are virtually impossible to get, run a bit over $400 each - often available only in boxes of four. Garden Box seats, which are also rare finds, run a bit over $120. You can sometimes split a box of four to buy two seats. Single seats may be hard to find. Terrace Boxes drop a bit more in price from there, then it's a nice linear price curve all the way to the top. Not every event sells out, so you can often get tickets right up to the show time, without going through a scalper. Lease event tickets can be considerably higher in price.Music & PerformanceThe Bowl is the summer home of the L.A. Philharmonic, and also has its own orchestra. Additionally, it has everything from Classical, to Jazz, to Rock, Pop, World Music, Orchestral Soundtracks, Movie Singalongs, and Comedians. It has been the famous home of the Playboy Jazz Festival for many years. If you are going just to go (i.e., not to see a specific act), you can just enjoy an evening under the stars. If you are going to see a specific act, then definitely try and get tickets as close to the stage as possible. Although there are no bad seats in the house, but it's such a big venue, the seats in the back can leave you feeling like you are watching ants on stage, despite the massive video screens throughout the seating area.Note that what are called ""Philharmonic events"" just refers to the sponsorship of the event, and jazz, pop/rock, world music and other artists perform under the Philharmonic Event banner. Lease Events are usually bigger popular music artists: For example, this season, Ozzy Osbourne. These events are marked in the Bowl website as ""Special House Rules Apply."" On the other hand, Beck is also appearing on a regular ""Philharmonic event"" night. So, you can bring wine to Beck, but not to Ozzy. Make sure you know before you go! It was sad watching people have to go back to their cars to avoid throwing out the nice bottle of $100 wine they brought for Steely Dan.",David G
50,Summeetime Free Rehearsals at the Hollywood Bowl.,"If you call Monday morning to the Hollywood Bowl box office and wait to speak to someone, you can ask if there are any open rehearsals that particular week. Usually Tuesday and Thursday, sometimes Friday. Usually 930am - 12 noon. Come and go as you like, I believe the parking is free. Definitely one of the best things to do in Hollywood, and you can visit the museum after (see my other review). Bring sunglasses, a hat and sunscreen, I see ladies with parasols often. If you're lucky you might see someone like Itzhak Perlman rehearsing with Gustavo Dudamel and the L.A Philarmonic. I bring a book and a sketch pad. Bring water!",kimo213
40,Beautiful summer evening at the Hollywood bowl,"We were invited by friends to attend the Hollywood bowl. We had not ever been here before so we had to learn what to expect and do. First you need to figure out if you are taking food, dishes, silverware, tablecloth, Etc OR pre-order your food through the Hollywood bowl. They bring you to go boxes with the food in it. The closer you get the better you can hear and see but you cannot See the overall shell with the band or orchestra in it, also parking is a premium so be sure and get there early and some tickets have special close parking so check your tickets.Enjoy your evening under the stars.",dkayec
50,What a venue! Beautiful night!,"We paid $15 for offsite parking at a nearby Church and left the teenagers on Hollywood Blvd to explore.This icon venue lives up to all expectations however RENT A CUSHION for $1. Your bum will thank you.And remember to bring BINOCULARS, the cheap seats are a long way away for the stage.The sound quality was excellent and the video production, for a live show/one time event, was “bang on” the right musician at the right time.Thanks for a great experience",GordWright
50,Toddler loved Annie performance,This is such a great venue for a show. We brought snacks and our 4 year old loved watching the play under the stars. I remember my parents taking me as a kid and it was awesome to go back. We parked at Hollywood and Highland and it was easy to take shuttle back and forth! It did cost $15 to park plus $6 each for shuttle though but a pretty quick in and out plan.,Michael
50,Gregory Porter and Savion Glover - an amazing evening!,"I've seen Gregory Porter perform live twice before, so I knew this was going to be an excellent evening. But Savion Glover? Tap dancing at the Bowl? How would that work, I mused .. but loving tap dancing from the age of 5, I figured what the heck! And then Savion started to tap. For 45 minutes straight - he was an amazing percussionist with a backup jazz band - and he worked hard!! With some tappers you can't follow the patterns and how it relates to the music being played - but not with Savion! The percussive taps and music were seamlessly combined. And Gregory Porter - his voice is deep, rich, a chocolate syrup for the ears. (Yes, I am a chocoholic.) And I missed hearing who the arranger was for the music for Mr. Porter's tribute to Nat King Cole, but many of his arrangements brought to mind fairy tales - and some brought back memories of the late, great, Gordon Jenkins' arrangements. What a night! I do hope the Bowl brings these performers back for another wonderful evening under the stars!",Vicki K
50,Loved seeing it,We couldn’t get tickets whilst we were in Los Angeles but were so glad that we were allowed to just have a look around at least - and let our imagination do the rest. Loved it.,Harrison F. Carter
40,"A truly Californian experience - the Hollywood Bowl. A bit of a hike to get there and back, but well worth the visit!!","The Hollywood Bowl is a one of a kind Californian experience that is well worth at least one visit. It's kind of an L.A. version of Glyndebourne in the UK - but, more relaxed and outdoors. The Hollywood Bowl was most recently renovated in 2004 - enlarged by 20% to fit a full orchestra. We watched one of the Star Wars movie - where the music portion was played live by the LA Philharmonic Orchestra. People brought light sabers or purchased them for $10 at the gift shops. You take a picnic or can purchase (or pre-order picnic boxes or other options beforehand - orders must be in by 4 pm the previous day). Suggest taking some food and drinks - then, buying additional items either at the Marketplace or one of the many fast food options. Picnic boxes were about $37 upwards. But, other 'street food' options started at about $12.99 onwards. If sitting on the benches - be sure to take a seat and back cushion (or rent one or two for $1/each) on the way in the concert area (take something from home just incase they run out). Also, take a sweater or so, even in the summers - unless there's a heatwave (as there was when we there - but luckily - had cooled down to the upper 70s (F) by the time we got there (sunset was at around 7:55 pm). The most tedious part was getting there. We took the Westwood Park and Ride ($7/person) option - but with traffic took 1 hour 10 minutes vs the 25 minutes getting back. Sit on the right hand side - if you're sensitive to the sun. If you're staying nearby - take an uber or other. But, for all others, guess Park and Ride is a lot better than trying to park at the venue - which is a bit of a nightmare trying to get out afterwards. One really good surprise - the women's bathroom - there seemed to be enough stalls, and during the intermission, there seemed to be an endless line, but it went quite quickly, as they had attendants directing people (very well managed/organized). So, not that bad. Overall, a very memorable positive experience.",ubbabe
50,Excellent music,We were there in the box for Saturday night which is a little bit lighter fare than the highbrow music during the week it was very enjoyable the weather was perfect the food which we purchased Ahead of time at the restaurant at the bowl was perfect as well as the service,Andamy18
40,Pleasant Evening Experience of Musical Performances,"Huge outdoor theater just north from Hollywood Boulevard. Parking is mostly stacked and can get real crowded. Most shows are classics or pop. We went to a weeknight L.A. Philharmonic; it didn't fill but the performance was outstanding. Food is available on site or you can bring your own. But you do have to go through an airport type security check. It rarely rains during the season but late into the evening, the air gets cooler. Note that there are bus shuttles from the Red Line, and you can also walk up along Highland to the main entry.",Zoom_Gotti
10,Hugely disappointed,"My friend and I had tickets for Melissa Etheridge, Keb’ Mo’ and Taj Majal on August 1 at 8:00 and decided to use the Park and Ride from Lakewood transportation option, as the Hollywood Bowl advertised on their website. The website stated that buses would be leaving at 5:40, 6:00, and 6:30. We arrived at 6:15, just in time to see the 6:00 bus leave. We were in a group of about 30, ready for the 6:30 bus, EXCEPT IT NEVER SHOWED UP. The two Hollywood Bowl support staff, Abraham and Norma, in their polo shirts with “Hollywood Bowl” clearly embroidered on, were wonderful in trying to find out what was going on, through phone calls and texts to their supervisors, but to no avail. At 7:35 Norma received word that the bus would be arriving in five minutes. However, by 7:55, she told us that the bus was not going to show after all. WE MISSED THE CONCERT AND THUS LOST THE COST OF OUR TICKETS. This is completely unacceptable. The Bowl needs to be called out for this. Our ticket price should be refunded!!",Kathleen H
50,4th of July Concert and Fireworks,"Best decision to book tickets to see the Go Go’s at the Hollywood Bowl on the 4th of July!! The concert was great and the venue was amazing. We had a great view from our seats and were amazing at the amazing sound that surrounded us. The Navy Band, LA Phil Harmonic and fireworks galore! Even our 17 and 22 year olds loved it! Wish we lived closer so we could make it an annual tradition! This was a highlight of our trip!",Dawn F
50,Outdoor Music High,"The largest open air amphitheater in the US?! It’s awesome. Thousands of people enjoying music with a California summer breeze and terrific acoustics...accompanied by good food and drink, good friends...a terrific experience. LA Philharmonic is doing a great job. Wonderful to see and hear. Big screens for close-ups of performers captivating. Go!",PlatinumHoney
50,Best picnic with a soundtack,"I cannot belabor the value of this unique LA experience. Because the weather is fabulous year-round you're safe to get tickets to the outdoor concert series and picnic here under the stars. The musicians they book, the acoustics, the lighting and ample giant screens mean that everyone has the best seat in the house. This is something NOT to be missed.",Lale W
50,The place to be for summer concerts!,"This is a really fun venue, especially during the summer concert series. You're listening to music you love, you're outdoors, under the stars. Many of these series events allow you to bring your own food and drink, so a picnic with friends fits right in. Parking can be tough, so a little patience is required, or catch the bus, tickets can be found at ticketmaster for around $12.00 roundtrip.",Chris D
50,Outstanding Musical Event at Hollywood Bowl,"Attended the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire movie at the Hollywood Bowl. Whilst the movie was projected on a number of large screens, the music was provided by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. A lot of audience participation during the performance combined with the Family Picnic atmosphere made this a very memorable night - the warm weather helped.",Kevin M
50,BEST Outdoor Music Venue,"Our family and a group of friends & their kids went to the Grease movie Sing-A-Long, which was a LOT of fun (who can complain when Sha Na Na is the opening act?!?). But this isn’t a review for the Grease show. This is for the Hollywood Bowl itself.Besides the fact that the Hollywood Bowl is in a city with year-round amazing outdoor weather, and besides the fact that there’s a fantastic view of the Hollywood Sign from the bleacher seats in this legendary historic venue that has hosted everyone from the Beatles to Tom & Jerry (not to mention the remarkable LA Philharmonic under Dudamel), I absolutely LOVE that the Hollywood Bowl allows (if not encourages) guests to bring their own food & drink. Bringing a picnic with sandwiches, some chips, crackers, cheese, &, of course, wine &/or beer, sitting in 72degree clear evening weather, eating & drinking with friends as you wait for some great show to start... even before the show starts, it’s ALREADY a magical evening. You know it’s a next-level great time at a concert when the actual show itself is just the icing on the cake, when you could go home BEFORE the show begins & still consider it a wonderful night.And if that isn’t enough, another great thing about the Bowl? During their summer season, tickets for some shows are under $10-15, and I think most, if not all, summer season shows have tickets as low as under $20, so not only is it a must-see place to catch a concert, it’s a very affordable must-see concert place (especially factoring in that you don’t have to spend outrageous amounts of money on arena food/drink).",SpencerP0721
