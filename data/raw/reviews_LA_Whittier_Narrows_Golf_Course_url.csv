40,Good to be golfing again!,"Glad it’s open for a 9-hole outing on Friday walking with push cart at the Mountain Course. Last time I played here was in February before the health crisis. The new starter set up was actually more straight forward and efficient. Felt good to be outdoors and truly appreciated the open space and fresh air, after months of sheltering in place. Golf’s an individual game so keeping social distance wasn’t difficult. This usually-crowded course was decently maintained, quite easy and level without water hazard. The pace was good and this outing turned out to be an enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LnS2004
