50,"Fantastic wine, Port, Lemoncello","Albeit very hard to get in as they are only open by appt. and those are limited to a few per month. However, if you do get and appt., sitting with the winemaker on the desk overlooking the San Fernando Valley is a rare treat.Porter Valley wines are very limited in production, less than 1000 cases annually.We tried their 2014 Zinfandel which was recently honored with a Silver medal at the annual International event. We enjoyed our time and left with wine and a complimentary bottle of lemoncello",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianh445
