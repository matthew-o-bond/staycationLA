50,Loved it!,"Overall the Hollywood experience is phenomenal. Not everything to do here is exceptional but you’re in Hollywood, so close to the stars and there a million things to do here. There’s something for everyone and not a single dull moment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
30,Walk of fame,"Ok,... this is a hard one. So busy you nearly walk on the road. It is a one off visit you need to do but once you've done it ,not again. The drive into the city is a night mare, it can take 1 hour for a 2 mile stretch, then you need to find parking. The sites and shows are great, good food. Not for young families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwQ3559HR
50,Give it a trial,"The Hollywood experience really means a lot to be simply because I do this tour anytime I have new friends visiting Los Angeles California. Therefore, you can never get bored with this scenic tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queencrez
