40,Sunday service,JANUARY 2017. We headed off to church for our first church visit in USA. We had arrived early and were made feel very welcome. All Saints church is very large building but it is very comfortable. The servie was great and we were able to purchase a copy of the service to take back home. A very spiritual church and they are doing lots of great things for the community.,Ann W
40,A Worthwhile Sunday,"When we travel, we look for interesting churches. If you don't, you can stop reading. We had never been to All Saints Pasadena, and wanted to see it as we were in LA for only a couple of days. We went for the hour presentation before church which had the Poet Laureate of LA. He was good and th discussion informative. The service is quite free form and heartfelt, and the music divine. This is an involved, active and thinking congregation and you could not make a mistake trying it on.",Douglas T
50,Special church event for 2,"My better half and I were passing by and we suddenly decided we had not taken holy Communion in far too long. We stepped into the cool church, bumped into a priest and told him we would like to take holy communion. About 10 mins later he reappeared in full pascal robes with wine and Host and gave us our Communion...just the 2 of us. It was a beautiful experience. Thanks.",mark +alexi k
50,One of Beverly Hills' original churches.,"In the heart of Beverly Hills' Golden Triangle but far removed from the prevailing atmosphere. The chapel is open most weekdays to retreat to and enjoy a time of private prayer and mediation. The original building was designed in the 20s and expanded in the 50s. I believe the architect is Roland Coates - Californian Spanish style, stained glass windows in the main churc. Sunday's buzz with a variety of different services.",GMHLA
