It was just heavenly enjoyable! The organ music was just amazing!4) Bonus: it is FREE!5) You can also check out other events on the website for silent movies and organ music!6) The gentleman who is the curator of the museum is an absolutely awesome and very knowledgeable tour guide.

50,Fantastic collection of Functional Art,"I visited the Nethercutt Collection last Friday on the recommendation of a car collector friend. The collection does not disappoint. Admission to the entire collection is free but you must signup to tour the main building that houses the Grand Salon. The car collection is just fantastic. I did also enjoy the tour of the train, Pullman train car and the musical instruments and demonstrations.

50,Can I mark this as a 10 out of 5?,"Wow, I had never heard of them until I did a search for car museums in Los Angeles and it came up. Their webpage just doesn’t how great this FREE museum is. There are two buildings - one is the main museums with 133 cars and a train. Everything works so the cars have gas and keys in them. They drive them all at least twice a year. The gem however is the Collection across the street in a 4 story building where they have fantastic cars, many who have won major awards like best of show at the Pebble Beach concurs de elegance. One car is the 20k Dusesenberg. While you are there on the tour, you listening to a grand piano player playing Rhapsode in Blue which was recorded by Gershwin himself. Then there is a floor with hundreds of car emblems and other player devices. The top floor has a number of orchestrations, huge bellow feed orchestras with as many of 21 instruments. Then there is the pipe organ from an old silent film theater. With 5,200 pipes with largest going from the basement to the 4th floor to deliver bass sounds that shake the building. Did I say free?

It has an impressive amount of antique luxury cars, brands like Rolls Royce, Deussenberg, Pierce Arrow, Daimler, etc are nicely placed in long rows. There are a few 50’s and 60’s and 70’s cars. The newest cars are a 80’s Rolls Royce and a De Lorean. The majority are 30’s and older. All cars are pristine.My favorite was the 1931 Bugatti.Out side there is a steam locomotive and Pullman coach.The visit took me 90 minutes and I felt I had more than enough time. Unfortunate the collection which is across the street was closed when I was there, but it was still worth it.

50,My type of cars....classics,Easy to find. Free. And the cars are stunning. from early teens to more recent. 99% authentic restorations of beautiful cars.

50,Fantastic Museum for free!!,My husband and I had a free afternoon and decided to spend it at the Nethercutt Museum and Nethercutt Collection. There are no fees for either but you do need to make a reservation for the Nethercutt Collection as space is limited.

This place really makes you feel like you have gone back in time.The Nethercutt Collection was phenomenal. Not only cars but old mechanical musical instruments that you wouldn’t see anywhere else and you actually get to hear some of them! The Wurlitzer Pipe Organ was amazing.

50,The Best Few Hours You Can Spend in LA (Sylmar),"Most free tours are worth what you pay for them, but this place is absolutely amazing. World class restored cars, an amazing hood ornament collection, and fully restored automated mechanical musical instruments (Orchestrions).The cars rival or surpass those found at the Peterson Auto Museum, the Blackhawk Auto Museum and the National Automobile Museum (Harrah Collection). The fifty or so vehicles have been restored to exacting specification and are of the highest quality. Duesenbergs, Packards, Cadillacs, and some you may have never heard of are here. The original factory colors are amazing, they are not just black.There are hundreds of hood ornaments, including those of Pierce Arrow, Rolls-Royce's Spirit of Ecstasy, Auburn and Isotta Fraschini on display. They even have a Isotta Fraschini on display.Outside the museum building, there is a restored Canadian Pacific steam locomotive and Clara Baldwin Stocker's restored Pullman Palace parlor car named ""California""The crown jewels of the collection are the fully operational mechanical instruments called Orchestrions. Lovingly maintained by Kyle Irwin, the sound from these mechanical orchestras is joyous. Kyle has done an amazing job keeping these mechanical wonders in tune and playing well.The most unusual thing is all of this absolutely free. The on-site parking is free, the entrance is free and the tours are free. You do need to sign up for a guided tour when you arrive.

Best find in the LA area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDTravelDoc

Check the website, the museum is only open a few days a week and has limited tours - but it is all free. hundreds of classic cars and old music players from yesteryear. Everything works and is in pristine condition. Off the beaten path, this is truely one of the hidden treasures in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmmeloche
50,Absolutely Amazing,"Amazing collection of early inventions from the second industrial revolution.

Also shows the neoclassical style popular in the early 20th century and some antique items that inspired it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanAtIDC
50,"How many times can you say ""wow'","I've wanted to visit here ever since I saw the Huell Howser episode and it didn't disappoint. I am glad that I read the website first. There are two locations of the museum. Both are free! The first has just cars, I think about 130 of them. It took us a couple of hours to go look at them. Many, many one of a kind vehicles. Also at this location is locamotive and private pullman car that is open twice a day for 20 minutes at a time, so you have to time your visit right.The other location is across the street and you need a reservation to do it. It has more cars, not sure how many maybe 40. I think these might be the more high end exhibits, it also has a really large collection of automated musical machines (think palyer piano but some are much, much more elaborate). Our group was much too large, I think 140 people. They would let you into a floor (there are 4 floors) and give a small talk at the beginning and or end of the floor and leave you to wander the floor at your own pace. The last floor is the music room and you get a concert there from some of the machines and a large player organ. The concert is very nice. I think the tour was around two hours.So a visit there can really be an all day, or most of the day visit. We started in the morning, grabbed a quick sandwich for lunch and rushed back to see the train at 12:30 and do the tour at 1:30.It is a great collection. The cars all have good descriptions and many will have some familiar connection (like being in the Rose Parade or being owned by someone famous). I could see making a return visit because it does get a little overwhelming by the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/So_Cal_Illini_81

50,California's BEST Kept Secret,"Whenever I meet visitors to Southern California, I always ask if they are planning to visit the Nethercutt Museum. Invariably, they've never heard about it. I explain that I've lived here since 1969, and I guarantee them there is no better attraction for everyone. You will never see anything like the Nethercutt. The most beautiful award winning automobiles (Best of Show at Pebble Beach), architecture, furniture, musical instruments, and even a locomotive with a fully furnished private Pullman car. You'll learn the history of the automobile, the history of music, and the local history of Baldwin Hills. A guided tour, complete with a live serenade, and your only chance (certainly in my lifetime) to experience an 8 Hertz note! All of this (and much more) for the unbelievable low price of $0.00!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519donf

If you are mechanically inclined or have an appreciation of fine craftsmanship this is your spot. And it's free!!! Make sure you schedule the tour. It is by reservation only.

50,Secret surprise! ...and it's FREE!,"This place is amazing! We've lived less than 10 miles from this collection for many, many years and just heard about it from a ""car loving"" friend. It's a ""word of mouth"" kind of place that friends let other friends in on. As far as we can tell there is very little advertising. It has to be one of the best collections of classic cars, a fully restored Pullman train and musical instruments all housed in two cavernous buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NY2StudioCity
50,One of the worlds finest automotive museums,Every classic automobile in the museum is fully restored to show quality and all are road worthy. Very Exotic. Access by reservation only. Also has a section of complex musical instruments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayS753
50,Wonderful car museum,"On the opposite side of the street from this museum you will find the 10 story Merle Norman Tower of Beauty. The building was purpose built to display J.B. Nethercutt's vast collection of rare cars and self-playing musical instruments. (J.B. was the nephew of Merle Norman and heir to the cosmetics fortune). The company holds 2 hour guided tours of the facility on a regular basis, but it does require a reservation that must be made by phone. The tours are free, but it can be difficult to secure a reservation. Since the Tower only has room to display a small portion of his car collection, it was decided that a another museum was needed to allow the public to see the cars that would otherwise be stored in a warehouse. Hence the Nethercutt Collection was created right across the street. Like the Tower, admission is free and no reservation is needed. Just show up during their regular operating hours. You could easily spend the better part of a day here, as the collection is extensive. If you combine a tour of the Tower with a visit to the Collection, I suggest you arrive at opening time, as you will need the whole day to see everything. Be advised that the Tower tours are on hold until about June, 2018, as they are currently renovating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim_Abney

50,Excellent,Only visited the auto museum. It’s free and excellent. They have about 100 vintage cars in superb shape. Most are from the 1920 to 1930s. Across the street is the collection with more cars and other items in a more upscale setting. You need to reserve a tour to see this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCB01
50,Breathtaking cars...and so much more!,"If you appreciate craftsmanship and history - spanning from gorgeous historic luxury cars to amazing mechanical musical creations - the collection is a must.Above all, do the tour of the full collection. Being able to stand right next to the cars, furniture pieces and music devices, looking closely, peering into the details (just don't touch!)...that's what sets this experience apart from a 'normal' museum with roped off displays. Even if cars aren't your thing, I can't imagine anyone seeing the Dusenbergs in the Grand Salon and not being blown away by the craftsmanship and style.Now there are many car museums, but I have never seen a collection celebrating the era of automatic music machines like this one - all kept functional and operating (as are the cars).Each item is wonderful, but what I loved is that the collection is a tribute to ingenuity and workmanship and functionality from an era before tv and computers. Fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215evant

30,Not a place for children.,"The collection is best for car enthusiast. It's best for older children who are into classic cars. It's a free admission, but there are rules. No backpacks or selfie sticks. No food or drink. All very reasonable rules. I recommend going to their website and making a reservation. And checking holiday closures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liketotravel619
50,Amazing Collection of Classic Cars - FREE TOUR!,"I had no idea that this place even existed, and was so excited when my wife found it on a local neighborhood newsletter. And we had no idea what to expect when we got there. We drove into parts of the North Valley that we'd never been to...down a street lined with people living in mobile homes...and then pulled into the free parking lot of a shiny warehouse building. There was a 1964 Bentley in the parking lot, so we assumed we were in the right place...but when we entered the front door we couldn't believe our eyes. There were dozens and dozens and even more dozens of perfectly restored classic vehicles, some more than a hundred years old, beautifully displayed and lit on the carpeted floor of this giant facility.Like the best car show you could imagine, yet even better as it was ALL FOR FREE.Asking at the desk we found that there was a two hour guided tour started in 30 minutes, and were asked if we wanted to get on he list for that, ALSO for free, which included a tour of the OTHER WAREHOUSE ACROSS THE STREET...where the ""REALLY SPECIAL CARS"" were located! LOL! Well we weren't sure that we had 2.5 hours in us before lunch, as we had no idea what this place, so we toured the place on our own. We were there, in just the first building, for close to two hours as there was so much to see. Even the Nethercutt Family's custom train car out back! All of it was amazing, even to my wife who isn't a huge car enthusiast. She especially really loved the super luxury custom wood trailer that you could step inside, and the collection of plates and silverware that were used for dining in the train car. Wow!Oh and the staff at the place are super knowledgeable, and incredibly nice, and happy to answer any questions you might have about any of the vehicles, even if you're not on the guided tour.Anyway, we're definitely planning to go again, and see the 2nd building as well next time, even though we can hardly imagine how those cars can be 'even more special' than the ones we saw in the first building. And we'll call ahead next time to check on hours and tour times before we go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpH381RS

50,great stop in a odd place and its free,The Nethercutt is a great stop its free and the museum is great they have old cars a train and a second museums across the street by appointment with cars vintage music machine's and more its also local so get off the couch and check it out I have went several times and still don't get board,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natzkem1
50,You'll never see anything comparable,"You will not be looking at automobiles. You will be looking at art pieces that can be driven. Truly one of a kind. The items in the building across the street will simply blow you mind (but you need reservations). It's not in a convenient location, but you will never regret making the time to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulrima
50,Excellent collection and there is much more than cars,"First trip. I was surprised by the fantastic collection of cars as well as the collection of musical instruments and other memorabilia. Great way to spend the day and LEARN something, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoiderella
50,Nethercut museum,"A surprising museum in a dull exterior building. So many different items to see close up. Over 100 vintage cars in perfect driving condition. The cars sit on Vermont marble in a ballroom. Second floor has an amazing collection of vintage hood ornaments that really works of art! The the musical instruments from around the world. They are hard to describe but the Wurlitzer Lugano with 50,000 pipes will blow you away. Outside is the opulent private train car of Zebulon Pikes daughter- don’t Mimi this also another building of spetcular cars. Have fun and it is FREE!!!!’",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187791traveler
50,A must see for auto afficionados,"First, you should know that there are two buildings involved in the Nethercutt Collection, the Collection and the Museum. The Collection involves a goodly number of classic autos, plus a assemblage of musical instruments, furniture, and other period pieces of exquisite quality. The Museum, in a building across the road, harbors a fabulous assemblage of antique autos from every part of the auto making world. The Collection was closed on the day we attended, but we spent over two hours viewing the autos in the Museum, a delight for those of us who enjoy automotive beauty. Rolls Royces are in abundance, as well as Pierce-Arrows and other early luxury autos. If you're an admirer of automotive beauty, you can't miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,Amazing display of vintage cars,"What an amazing collection and so well maintained. Slightly out of the way but well worth a visit, free entry into the car collection but book ahead to get in the tour of the entire collection just across the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jgud
50,Don’t miss this museum,"Don’t be fooled by the location which seems to be in an industrial area. There are two parts to this museum: a showroom of antique cars from the early 1900’s that is open to the public and a four storied building across the street that houses more wonderful cars, mechanical musical instruments and antique furniture that is only accessible by a docent led tour. The best part is both places and even the tour is free! If you want to go on the tour which is 2 hrs, call and make reservations as the times alternate between morning and afternoon. The tour was the highlight as we were up close to some rare, beautiful cars, like a 1933 Duesenburg model SJ Arlington Torpedo sedan and 1938 Mercedes Benz 540K Cabriolet. Photos are allowed. The third floor had a wonderful collection of hood ornaments and the fourth floor was amazing with antique orchestrions, music boxes, an amazing Wurlitzer that all worked! We were treated to some wonderful music in a beautiful room! Our guide Kirk, was informative, entertaining and knowledgeable about the automobiles and musical instruments. The two hours went by quickly. If you have trouble standing, there are comfortable chairs on every floor and an elevator if you have trouble with stairs. The collection is privately owned by the the Nethercutt family of Merle Norman cosmetic fame. After the tour you can go next door and purchase Merle Norman cosmetics at a small shop. Definitely a wonderful experience that is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pasherry
50,"Amazing building, amazing collections","This is one of the gems of the San Fernando Valley. The Nethercutt family spent years putting together a dazzling, diverse collection of fine old cars, furniture, musical instruments and other pieces that reflect their love of 'functional art'. Everything mechanical is kept in perfect operating condition, the interior of the museum and the separate car collection is gleaming, and the historic railroad engine and traveling car are gorgeous. And it's all free! We've been their many many times over the years, and always take our out of town guests there, as well as most of our friends and neighbors who hadn't heard of it. Definitely a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cm-in-ca
50,Great Collection of Classic Car,If you are a fan of classic cars you gotta be here. I had been to this place with my dad and he was so happy seeing the collection of cars of his time and earlier. Overall a great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamesysmithy
50,"First of all, this is FREE, Second it is highly unusual, interesting and entertaining.","Reservations needed for the 2 hour tour, which is only for 12 years and up due to the highly sensitive restored automobiles and antiques. The tour was fascinating as were all of the demonstrations of working antique musical ""machines"", including a one hundred year old Wurlitzer organ with over 5,000 (wind) pipes in the walls. The concept is to restore to working condition old automobiles and musical pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinRealtor
50,Wow! The highlight of my trip.....,"Went to the museum on saturday. Made reservation for the tour the day before. Glad I did. What an awesome place. The cars are from the era I like most, teens thru 30s. I went to Petersen Auto museum a couple days before and this was much more to my liking. And did I mention it was free? Great collection of mechanical musical instruments. I will definitely come here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homerj64
50,Greatest collection of cars...plus more,"This is easily one of the greatest collections of classic, one of a kind and beautiful cars. The main museum floor is open to the public most days, but to take the tour you will have to set an appointment.You will see a model 'T',railroad cars, muscle cars, Deusenbergs and other wonders of the automotive world. You cannot touch them, but you can get near them and look within and learn some amazing facts.But just when you think that is all, you get a musical experience like no other. You will be introduced to a unique player piano and various special music boxes and an Organ, whose pipes take up a whole ballroom.Look forward to hearing an amazing collection of Orchestrions. Don't Google it, learn by experiencing it there for the first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josefs387
30,Weird Place- Great if you are an Old Car Nut- Otherwise Skip,"I like old cars enough, and this family had a huge collection of them, you can get fairly close to the cars. The only downside is you are forced on a really slow, excruciatingly boring tour talking about the family more than the cars for over 2 hours. I wanted to scream. Also when I went years ago there was a dress code requiring you to look fancy...like come on! I can understand not wanting people to close toe shoes so they don't trip...but um beyond that? Get real!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd
50,World class auto museum- and it’s free,"Wow- what a placeOne after the other- perfectly restored grand marques with many owned by famous folksPut together using $ from Merle Norman cosmetics, it shows what deep pockets can doA second museum across the street can only be visited on a guided tourCheck website for details",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfadds

50,Wonderful vintage car collection,"This venue has some amazing cars from the early part of the 20th Century. It is free and a very comfortable place to visit. Free parking, too. There is a vintage railroad car to see, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56gregs
50,The cars are works of art.,"I was going to check out the Petersen Museum, but, I saw this place and I'm glad I went. It's a little far north, but, it's completely free, including parking. The automobiles they have here are so beautiful - to see them close up is just amazing and there are so many of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineaM6515IQ
50,Amazing Car Collection!,"Hidden Gem of a car collection in the valley. You must make reservations to get in ahead of time, but well worth it if you like vintage cars. This is the collection from the Max Factor Family if I am correct in saying. The docent/guide takes you through the whole museum which lasts about and hour. It is in a nondescript type warehouse looking building. Great place to see restored beauties. There is also a collection of hood ornaments, pipe organs and other things too. I recommend this place to go to if you like vintage cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atomicgerry
50,Amazing Collection!!!,"So glad we finally took the time to go to the Nethercutt Car Museum. An amazing collection of beautifully restored cars (and some unrestored) and car parts. Beautiful building to show case probably 50+ cars - and a firetruck. We spent almost 3 hours here easily. I'd recommend starting on the right side when you come in. Read the info about the cars, look at the display cases - then look at the cars. Notice the hood ornaments on many of them. My favorites are the early 1930s Pierce-Arrows....the styles - colors - chrome. Wish you were able to see inside the cars but with the ropes up (and me being short) I couldn't see the interiors well. They are in the process of restoring a train car and engine outside. On your next trip - plan on making reservations (Thurs-Sat) for their other building across the street - more cars and musical instruments, and more. Did I mention both these museums are FREE!SO worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4299XEsusanp

Drive and I’m in front of big building.Just after entrance door I found service desk and apparently no fee is needed.It’s big, Great collection of Art Deco cars, from the beginning of gas age till mid of 20 s century.

And many others.There is library inside. There is room for relatively modern cars and there is stand for emblems, tools, unique collection.On the walls pics from old, owner or patrons of this miracle. And on the glass stand your can see actress of that golden era and driver.And, like in game, I start chat w service desk and found that tomorrow they contact special tour in next building , just subscribe is needed, ll come back tomorrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593yurys
50,hidden gem,I found this place by accident and what a wonderful surprise!It is one of the most impressive car collections i have ever seen. Nicely displayed and kept.Make sure to see the schedule especially of the tour as it is definitively worth doing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marxiana
50,Just amasing,"Over 130 cars on display and all in working order over 2 buildings .Even a Steam locomotive with a Carrage in the Back yard, The Main building Houses the cars in the Basement as well as on the groundfloor on a Marble floor . Upstairs houses the huge pipeorgan plus other musical instruments .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwinf1
50,A Different type of Art Museum,"I love seeing works of art and this array of beautiful old cars qualifies. Extensive selection of cars from different places and periods, as well as other artifacts and resources, like an awesome collection of hood ornaments, works of art in themselves! We spent many hours here and I'd go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janebluestein
50,A must see,I have never seen so many old cars in one place. The price is free. You get up close and personal with cars from 1905 to 1945 all in one place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billcE3222IR
50,First Class Collection and Curator - and it's FREE!!!,"When you feel a desire to float back in time, do so at the outstanding Nethercutt Museum. Make your reservation (yes, it's worth it) and be sure to be a part of the elite group of enthusiasts, feasting your eyes on the most exquisite collection of vintage automobiles, Wurlitzers, and timepieces. Have a listen as Kyle Irwin, Curator and Restoration Specialist embraces this spectacular journey through time. It is simply, amazing and none of the cars or museum pieces are roped off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4288POmaryb
50,Hidden gem,"Because you need to make a reservation, this museum takes a little more effort than some, but it is so well worth it. I wish I had experienced it sooner, because it'll be on my short list of places to bring guests. The car collection is amazing, but the music collection is unique and astounding! Most exhibit rooms also included figurines and other collectibles in beautiful museum furniture along the walls. Our guide was the sole maintenance/technology wizard who has a long history with the museum and who brought it to life in so many ways. That the Nethercutt family procured all these treasures to share with the public is more priceless than the value of all their collectibles. I wish I could thank them in person and tell them what it means to me. Make the effort to see this unbelievable collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValerieFern
40,Very nice but static,"There are some very nice cars in this collection, but it is heavily weighted to early century town cars and limousines. The emphasis on cars with some celebrity or notable ownership works for concours's but a broader base of historical perspective appeals to me. Don'get me wrong, this is a stellar collection and well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmE1362ED
50,What a collection!,"The Nethercutt is an incredible collection of vintage automobiles.We almost missed the place because it's not exactly on a busy street, or even a busy city. My classic-car-loving daughter and I walked through and examined every single car. They are meticulously cared for, no doubt.One of the highlights of the museum for us was the matching sedan and camper. One of the employees was cleaning the campers exterior when we walked up, and encouraged us to go inside and have a look. No cheap plastic inside that family truckster!! Wow! Just be careful and watch your head as you go in and out of the camper (ouch!!)The collection of hood ornaments was really neat to see, as well.Well worth the price of admission. Oh, did I forget to mention that it was free? Good luck finding a more interesting museum in LA for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dan1724
50,Not just for vintage car enthusiasts,"We visited on a Friday afternoon, and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. It was fascinating to see all the beautiful vintage cars and see the evolution of the automotive industry. It’s amazing that the cars are all in mint condition and operable. And the Lalique radiator caps are wondrous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachym2017
50,Beautiful Car Collection,"The Nethercutt has a beautiful car collection at their open walk in museum. I say at least over 200+ cars available to watch without an appointment. Free admission. Their second building across the street has another must see collection of cars and many other antiques, you need an appointment thou for private tour on second building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnybaca02
50,Nice Environment with Car Lovers,"The posted pictures do a good job at showing this as a beautiful space, clean and quiet. The automobiles are in perfect, showroom condition. If you want to look at a whole line of Rolls Royce or Cadillac cars and similar from the early to mid 20th century, this is the perfect place, and there is no charge to see the collection. There are really no hot rods unless you count cars like a convertible 1955 Hudson Hornet.The collection has town cars may dating back to the teens and twenties as opposed to 50's-era giant fin autos, etc. There are two mint-condition motor-driven fire engines, and an old auto-organ. The Nethercutt is a perfect place to meet with Car Lover friends and look at some awesome old machines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmpdsc
50,A must see museum that is in a not so desirable neighborhood.,Very impressive collection of cars that are the big winners at Pebble Beach. Really unbelievable workmanship. The top floor is dedicated to music but shouldn't be missed. The Wurlitzer organ performance was so good we bought a CD something I rarely do anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EasyBruce
50,Awesome Cars | Great Docents | Incredible History,"The history of the Nethercutt family never ceases to amaze me. The facility is just incredible, certain elements are just breathtaking.The Tour Guide and Curator are so well informed as are the volunteer docents. You're able to get up close and personal with everything. Functional Art. If you have the time book a tour, all tours are guided there are no self guided tours. Tour length is 2 hours and there are stairs and lots of walking.For those of you with kids, kids MUST be 10 years or older there are no exceptions. You're able to take AS MANY pics as you want BUT NO FLASH NO FLASH NO FLASH this includes NO FLASH on your cell phones. NO FLASH and NO FLASHLIGHTS.I can't tell you how many times they stopped the tour to tell someone about their f'n flash. Annoying.You'll learn the history of the automobile, but also so so so much more. The also have a private personal locomotive on display that you can view from the outside and also from the inside.The museum which is different from the collection does afford you the opportunity for a self guided tour. The museum houses about 100 class and historic vehicles that can be viewed during operational hours without a reservation.The collection requires a reservation and is two hours but well worth it. Sadly the two hours flies by when the tour is over you don't want to leave.If you're a fan of cars this is a must see and a must do. If you're not a fan of cars, you'll still enjoy for the history. Not to fret there's more to this place than meets the eye so if you don't like cars they have you covered with all the other wonders that are contained within this off the beaten path find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DS9MW
50,Best Find in the LA area,We loved this place! It has the best collection of beautiful restored cars that we could ever imagine. Reserve a tour! A pearl in the oyster.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hotziek60s
50,More than just cars!,"The collection was so much more than I expected. First there was the extraordinary collection of automobiles and associated artifacts, like the hood ornaments. Add the marvelous musical instruments, period furniture, and decorative art - including some Faberge eggs. The 2-hour tour was very informative, the guides were excellent, and they provided ample time for you to roam around each area. This museum is definitely worth the trip to Sylmar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenJamaicaPlain
50,Amazing,"Simply mind blowing, the magnificent selection of cars, the decor, the amazing instruments maintained by Kyle, the self playing organ, absolutely stunning. 10/5 in my books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/416madarau
50,A true gem for lovers of cars and automated musical instruments,"If you love cars, this is a don't-miss! The Collection covers a wide range of cars from a 1933 Duesnberg to a classic woody. Although the vehicles are pristine, they are kept in working condition and they get driven regularly, even on the local freeways! To visit, you have to reserve in advance for a guided tour (check ahead - they often fill up). The Nethercutt Museum is located across the street. It's self-guided and you can just walk-in. Both the Museum and the Collection are complete free. They even have free parking - a rare, much-valued commodity in Los Angeles!In addition to the cars, the top floor contains a stunning collection of automated musical instruments. These are all mechanical, way before the days of digital anything. They are physically beautiful (and some are enormous) and the music is absolutely magical. It's an odd combination, to be sure, but it makes for an interesting visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilasU6995RS
50,A treat for music maestros as well as petrol heads,Stunning exhibition of vehicles and musical automatons...a delightful way to spend a few hours and a wonderful collection..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GGCag
50,Very w/c elderely friendly staff!,"My father who is w/c bound and 92 years young, and still has the zest for life, thoroughly enjoyed every part of this tour. There were a couple of impassable tight squeezes among some of the cars, but at least 95% of the cars and all the musical instruments were accessible. Kyle and his crew went out of their way to make my father feel special and answered his plethora of questions about his boyhood cars. After spending an arm and a leg at the Petersen for their docent tour, These guys were just that much better. Please and I say please call ahead to get on their guided tour list so the few disgruntled reviews this magnificent car/musical experience will not be repeated. We went on the Fourth of July week and were told ahead of time that they would be closed. My dad and I have done the 100 free things to do in LA and this is by far the most amazing tour we have been on. Oh, did I mention that it was FREE! Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/468chipg
50,Superb!,"What a gem! Whilst there are a plethora of quite outstanding vintage cars in this collection, the highlight for me was the Mighty Wurlitzer and collection of incredible musical instruments. Stunning collection of vintage musical pieces restored to an amazing standard. Our guide was passionate, humorous and extremely knowledgable. This amazing experience is free to visit with pre booking. Great afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJC-DW
50,Fascinating collection!,Guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Free but must book your tour in advance. I highly recommend seeing this collection!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABG7713
50,All of this is free? You've got to be kidding!,"We had been to the museum, across the street, but weren't able to make the tour. Came back specifically for the tour, and it was more than worth the drive. You can't buy this stuff. A lot of it is one of a kind. The Duesenberg Torpedo is a custom-built automobile. You can only see it here, and it is amazing. It's priceless in value. For us to see it? It's free! You can't get in it, but you can get so close to it that they ask gents to remove their belt buckles, rings, and watches. There are other automobiles that are almost as impressive. Not into cars? How about mechanical music boxes? Not the little ones. Some are as big as a living room wall, and sound amazing. The Imperial piano--97 keys, instead of the standard 88. It's big, and unique. The Mighty Wurlitzer theater organ--over 5,000 pipes, and able to reproduce all kinds of sound effects. This is not a sterile tour giving you the technical facts. Guide, curator and head of maintenance, Kyle, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the items, all kinds of weird and funny tidbits about the collection. Really worth experiencing. The building has elevators and is wheelchair and walker accessible. Stroller accessible, but not the best place for young children. There are excellent restrooms and water fountains. Parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223
40,Beautiful Cars & a cool organ,Easy walking lots to see great cars. All types of cars. The old organ upstairs was very cool . It was Halloween so they were playing music on it and the whole place was decorated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goshop58
40,"We missed the collection, but did see the car museum","I can only rate the part we saw: the car collection and the private rail car. The cars are mostly depression era luxury cars, with a very few lesser cars in the mix. Each car has a fairly informative panel, describing the marque represented, as well as the particular car itself where it has a unique history.Parking is adjacent to the car museum, free, and accessible from Bradley Avenue, not Bledsoe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurr4
50,Awesome - Sign up for the tour,There is something for everyone at the Nethercutt. Note that there are two buildings - across the street from each other. The Nethercutt Museum is basically a car museum. You don't need tickets or a reservation - just go in and take in the cars. The Nethercutt Collection can only be seen via a guided tour. You need to make reservations online or call. Normally there is one morning and one afternoon tour (Friday through Sunday).....but often only one tour on Friday.The docents are incredible. Ours was a technical specialist who supervises the restoration of cars and musical instruments. The cars in the Collection are incredible - as are the music boxes and antique phonographs and all sorts of self-playing musical instruments over 100 years old.Oh - did I mention both the museum and the collection are FREE!!!?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GareThere
50,FREE to See An Amazing Collection of Vintage Cars and More,"In one building there is an amazing and huge collection of vintage cars, all in excellent condition. Photos are allowed and you walk around at your own pace. Across the street is another building with some vintage cars on the main floor and historical musical instruments and machines on the other floors. For this building you must sign up for a tour but both buildings are FREE to tour. Parking was free as well. If you appreciate things from the past you'll enjoy The Nethercutt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89sandil

40,Guys love this place!,"I'm not really interested in cars....usually! But this place is so amazing that you get hooked in the first few minutes you are there! It's a must-see for everyone, at least once. There is more to see than just their classic cars. ( although that is reason enough)😊It's free too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
40,Reservations Required for Full Exhibits,"The Nethercutt Collection includes an open floor of 100 classic cars and the train locomotive out back. Tours inside the Pullman cars and train engine are only offered twice a day. To see the larger collection of classic cars and exhibits in the 4 story bldg across the street requires an advanced reservation (offered twice daily at 10:00 or 1:30, but only on Thu, Fri, Sat). All tours are free and the self tour bldg is open Tues-Sat. Parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolangfo
50,Just Take The Tour and Have Your Mind Blown!,"We visited the general admission portion of the collection last year and were curious as to what was hiding in the larger building across the street. To get in here, one must pre-register for the free, 2-hour, scheduled tour. It's a worthwhile tour just to see the cars, but the cars pale in comparison to the musical instrument collection.The super-informative and energetic tour guide (who also happens to be the mastermind behind keeping the musical elements in working order) introduced us to a new world of vast, complex, automated musical instruments. Even if, like me, you're not a total music lover, one has to be blown away by the collection of music-generating devices being preserved and played at the Nethercutt Collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertR402
50,Largely unknown and out of the way but worth it!,"I would never have know about this wonderful museum if a family member hadn't told me about it. They showed me a book, about the museum, and when I saw the photos of cars and other collections I had to go. Several times a year they have special events featuring theater organ music, like silent movies and Christmas concerts. The museum itself is gorgeous with marble floors and crystal chandeliers. The Calliope collection is also amazing and such a throw back in time. Sylmar is a bit of a drive but I think it's worth it. This museum will likely be of more interest to those over 40 or to younger people who have an appreciate for older cars that are immaculately kept and all road worthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
50,Wonderful collection of more than beautiful automobiles,"This is a fantastic place to visit. Not only were the cars beautifully displayed, there are also a pullman train car and a locomotive, which can be toured under the guidance of a docent. You can easily spend a couple of hours here. Very kids friendly place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vetism
50,Fantastic Collection,"Firstly I have to say what an amazing collection, the cars have been restored to such perfection. We went on the guided tour which takes two hours, our guide was so passionate about the company had it was a pleasure to listen to him tell the story of how the collection came about. There are lots of stairs between floors but don’t worry for those of you with mobility issues there is a lift for use. The tour as you will have read is free as is visiting the museum. We got there via public transport it took us just over an hour to get there but if you have a car a lot quicker. Well worth the time spent to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TKP1325
50,Much more than cars!,"I went along on this tour because my friend is really 'into' restored automobiles. I came out of the tour eager to tell others to give it a chance! There is so much more to the Nethercutt's collection than their automobiles, and beyond that, they were an amazing couple, with the desire to open up their collections for everyone to enjoy. The tours are free but you MUST reserve a space in advance. If you don't, there is one section of the museum to visit (only cars) and you'll miss so many other cars that your tour guide will explain to the tiniest detail. You'll also miss the amazing collection of musical instruments that play themselves, and you won't hear how the staff is cared for my the Nethercutts even to this day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysC1119JB
50,Hidden Jem,This is a little hidden jem of a museum. There area multiple buildings with numerous collections not just cars. Great for a car enthusiast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789roystons
50,Take a step back in time at this hidden Gem!,"The Nethercutt Collection & Museum is a little known gem in Sylmar, CA. With an amazing array of vintage cars and musical instruments there is so much to see and learn. The guided tour is worth the time and gives you access to the entire collection. If you have never heard an Orchestrion, prepare to be amazed! The auto museum is varied with over 250 cars in the collection and over 50 cars on display at a time, including vintage railroad cars. The staff is very knowledgeable and courteous. There is no dress code and cameras are allowed. Leave your tripods, selfie sticks, monopods, and food and drinks (except bottled water) at home because they are not allowed in. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlucin

Full disclosure, I wish there were more exhibits for kids to do, so really I feel like it's more of a 4 star then 5 star thing to do... BUT, being as big as it is and being FREE, it deserves 5 stars.Try to plan your visit right for when they open the train in the back. We missed that. Additionally, there are free scheduled tours for adults only to see the collection across the street that is supposed to be unbelievable with mechanical instruments and whatnot. I can't wait to go back and see that!If you like old school cars... Packards, Fords, Plymouths, Bugatti's, etc... this place is for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,ONE OF THE BEST COLLECTIONS IN THE U.S.,"Nethercutt offers one of the nations most beautiful collections in a CLASS A facility in southern California. Worth every extra mile you travel to see it. The cars on display are in incredible condition, and while you shouldn't touch them they are close enough to feel the luxury. Bring the wife/girlfriend because across the street and open on weekends and a few other days is another museum (Mrs. Nethercutt's') that both of you will find very interesting. It includes specific owner cars, an incredible doll collection, musical instruments and a lot more. As an old time comic once said ""Try it you'll like it !""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IRAGLYPHIC
50,Two amazing museums in one!,"We visited both the Nethercutt Museum and the Collection, which are across the street from each other in Sylmar, CA. We were amazed by these two jewels! These free museums were left to the public by the Nethercutts of Merle Norman Cosmetics. The Museum features cars primarily from the 1900's-1930's. Amazing quality in all of the vehicles! The Collection requires visitors to sign up online in advance. The tour guide is the curator of everything that is not an antique auto. This includes all kinds of musical instruments including in-wall music boxes, some of which play up to 20 musical instruments when activated only by air pressure or vacuum. The crown jewels of this part of the Collection are a 1900's Wurlitzer organ used in a theater, teamed with an oversized grand piano. They are synced to play various pieces together without a human actually playing them. The walls, ceiling, and floor collectively serve as the speakers, so the whole room rumbled like and earthquake when they played All of the musical instruments we saw are unique and amazing to view and hear. Also, the Collection features some of the most beautiful, rare, and sought-after vehicles in the entire world. These vehicles are much more impressive than the autos across the street in the Museum. What a great pair to have experienced!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allicron19
50,The best ever,To start with it’s FREE and it’s astonishing. 220 rare and beautiful car as well as a collection of musical instruments that will take you breath away. Great fun for everyone. Tours must be reserved but remain free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffhB6882CC
50,Beautiful Cars!,"If you love old classic cars, this is definitely a must! There was so much beauty, I didn't know where to start. You can tell they take great care and pride with every single car there. I couldn't stop taking pictures! It's a completely relaxed and lovely way to spend time looking at beautiful cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessicamarialara13
50,"Organs and Autos and Hood Ornaments, Oh, My!!!","We'd never heard of the Nethercutt but read about it in a tour book and gave it a try. Very fun place. We're not that interested in old cars but these cars were not your ordinary antique cars. They were quite special and had been expertly restored to their original glamour. They told us they had 160 cars and had to rotate them because they didn't have enough space to show them all. There is the Nethercutt Museum on one side of the street and then the Nethercutt Collection on the other side.We took the free tour of the Nethercutt Collection and, though there were close to 75 on our tour, this museum and the tour guide could handle this many. We never felt crowded or that we couldn't hear. We first toured the 2-story lower level of the Nethercutt Collection and this was filled with glossy gleaming perfectly restored cars. Beautiful and rare. What a 'doozy' the Duesenberg was. Upstairs on the mezzanine were lots of other collections: hood ornaments (originally called 'mascots') galore and several mechanical musical instruments. On the third floor is a carpet hand-sewn just for this floor with French court table and chandelier and quite a few mechanical musical instruments. But the center piece is the Wurlitzer Organ, the third larges in the world. We had an excellent guide who was the actual archivist who authenticated the items in the collection. Wonderful tour. Who knew old cars could be so exciting?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
40,Classic cars from the golden age of automobiles,"A very large collection of classic automobiles. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The staff and docents are friendly and helpful. The other collection of instruments is wonderful also. Some of the items and autos are just unbelievably beautiful. It is one of the very best collections we have ever enjoyed. By the way, it is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenGregg

50,One of the World's Great Car Collections,"J.D. Nethercutt was a remarkable man in many ways. He was a true Pioneer in car collecting and he would do no-holds-barred restorations on cars that he liked even if they were not valuable.What's really phenomenal is that right there, on site, skilled Craftsmen can make literally almost every single part for any car with the exception of tires and engine blocks. This shows in the way the colors are presented. Their diversity, their attention to detail, their paint quality...just remarkable.Admittedly, the location is out of the way in the strange place called Sylmar. But it is truly worth the trek. His other passion was collecting musical machinery which also has to be seen to be believed.J.D. Nethercutt won best of show at Pebble Beach numerous times and for good reason. Several of those best of show winners are on display every day there.Even for those who are not into cars but appreciate art and things of beauty, you will be overwhelmed by the scale, quality and overall wonderfulness of this very important car collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwangers

50,Unexpected collection here in LA,"I was born and raised in Los Angeles and even worked for many years near the Nethercutt Collection in the San Fernando Valley. But I had never visited until yesterday with my husband. First it is free to park, free to enter...it is just FREE. The collection is huge and rivals ones we have seen at the Peterson Automotive museum and the one in Las Vegas. It is a simple, no frills, no high technology display. And attests to the love of the automobile the Merle Norman heirs must have. Plan ahead and arrange the docent tour of the building across the street that houses more cars and mechanical musical instruments. We plan to do the tour the next time we venture out to the San Fernando Valley. A real treat , go to Carillos for authentic mexican food after the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyAN
50,The collection WILL blow your mind.,"First, I have to disclose that I love museums, history, fine things and spending time looking at things from the past. The rest of my family, not so much. Until we all visited the Nethercutt Collection - and the rest of my family oohed, ahhed and said probably a dozen or more times - ""oh my gosh, I can't believe my eyes."" So, there you have it - even the most reluctant will enjoy this collection. We in the parking lot (yes, it's free parking - take that other car collections that charge an arm and a leg for two hours parking), then found a kind tour guide who told us to cross the street, go down the ramp and wait for the tour guide. As we looked at a smaller collection of cars and different items from the family's collection, we were called to begin our tour promptly at 10am. We walked into the main museum (hope I'm not ruining any surprises, but the area is modeled after what showrooms looked like in the 1920's and 1930s for luxury cars). I definitely won't ruin the surprise of what you will see in that ""showroom"" but it will definitely leave an impression - take a look at some one of a kind cars, a number of award winning cars and hear some facts that you have definitely never heard before. Then up the grand staircase (there are plenty of elevators for those who prefer, there were multiple people with walkers and wheelchairs - so this is accessible for all) to more beauty and grandeur. Finally, to the music room - again, what you will see and hear is unforgettable. Back across the street to see more cars and memorabilia (this is on your own and not part of the guided tour), then there is an opportunity to see two working trains. The Nethercutt Collection is a must do, as others have said, it's free - but more importantly, it takes you back to a time when people spent their wealth collecting and preserving items that were rare and in danger of being lost. I was also surprised to learn that Merle Norman cosmetics is the last remaining American cosmetics company. You will need about 2 1/2 hrs there - more if you want to see the trains too - but it is absolutely worth your while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
50,Great place to see vintage automobiles,"My husband is a car fanatic and as much as I am not a big fan of car museums, this one is truly exceptional. It has the largest collection of antique cars I have ever seen along with the other items and its FREE. We have visited a lot of automotive museums and this one is just as good as some that we have paid plenty to get into. We were met outside and welcomed by the curator of the Collection, and then escorted into the lower level of the Collection. There were about 50 or 60 people on the tour, and it took about two and a half hours to do. The facility is beautiful, and the cars are in magnificent condition, and presented in a very grand setting. If you are a car enthusiast or just want to spend a nice couple of hours enjoying some beautifully restored old cars- I highly recommend the Nethercutt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_Williams191
50,Never seen anything to compare!,"Owners of the Merle Norman Cosmetics have amassed an impressive collection of luxury vintage cars, hood ornaments, car parts and mechanical musical instruments and organs. There is also a Pullman train car and engine out back.Suffice it to say, you just need to visit! It’s free and I can’t think of another collection that’s this impressive.The auto museum is on one side of the street and you can tour it at your leisure. You do need to make reservations to tour the separate collection across the street. The collection tour is still free but guided and takes about 2 hours by itself. There are limited days and times that they are open, so double check the website before you drive a distance.There is plenty of free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RNRVTraveler
50,Don't Miss This Gem!,"This is an amazing museum to visit. Not only is there a stunning collection of restored cars, but there are also hundreds of outstanding musical machines.

We thought this would be a nice place to visit, but were completely and pleasantly surprised to find this truly amazing gem!

The collection is all impecably restored and ready to drive. While mostly American manufacturers are represented, there are some exceptional European cars as well. The top floor of the original building houses a working collection of automated music instruments from music boxes to a massive theater pipe organ; all are fully functional and every tour gets to hear representative pieces play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2126MNpaulk

50,"Totally recommend this place and I'm not even ""into"" cars","My boyfriend wanted to come here after finding it recommended; I'd never even heard of it and would never have guessed Sylmar would have a place like this, but the Nethercutt Collection is something I've now recommended a lot. When I went, there was a dress code (like no sandals or shorts) but it was still way worth it, and truthfully, made it nicer. Pristine classic automobiles parked on marble floors with gilt mirrors and crystal chandeliers. Even the hood ornament collection will make every rapper jealous. Drawing the line at dolls, though--that will never fail to not be creepy.Across the street, there's a whole museum of cars, rows and rows, and a full train engine and gorgeous private car on a set of tracks that shouldn't be missed. It's all free, and so unusual. Great place to take guests.The Nethercutt is so much more than cars. Concerts in the Music room, part of the tour, from the showpiece Wurlitzer organ with the pipes in the walls to the Nickelodeons will blow your mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/native210
50,Ya just gotta love this place!!,"Despite being well aware that I'm definitely not a museum or car guy our hosts decided we needed to see this collection of vehicles.

50,An Amazing ( and Free! ) Collection of Historic Automobiles and More!,"Oddly situated in Sylmar, there are two buildings that make up the Nethercutt Collection. The main car collection is housed in the Museum building, where you can walk right in and start walking among the many rows of pristine restored cars. On display are cars from the 1900s through the 1960s. The museum rotates cars in and out, so you may see something new each time.Behind the Museum building is a restored steam engine and a private Pullman car, which shows an extremely luxurious form of rail travel.Across the street from the Museum building is the Collection building. Here, you must reserve a spot for one of the docent-lead tours. Inside are more wonderful cars, some that are exhibited in a huge recreation of a luxurious old showroom. You are guided upstairs (an elevator is available) where some of the family's collections are displayed. Finally, you are taken to the top floor music room where a collection of large, working, orchestrions, player pianos, and nickelodeons are kept . . . and played for the tour. Finally, the huge pipe organ is played.You can easily spend an hour or more browsing just the cars in the Museum building. The tour of the Collection building probably takes a few hours. Call well in advance to get into a tour. Also, check into their special concerts in the music room.This is a fun trip for adults. Kids may not find it that interesting, especially since there is a ""don't touch"" policy. Even if you are not ""into cars"", there is a lot of history to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/am_a_freethinker

The fact that it was free had us thinking it would have limited quality and content.'How wrong we were. This is an amazing experience with people who love their collection, and a generous family giving back to the world, a little piece of their success and hard work.This is better in my opinion than over 80% of the museums I have been to that have charged entry.It's the best car collection and musical museum I have ever seen and the tour for 2 hours was a highlight of the week.The library inside where you can gain access to information on cars from all ages is a real gem.Do yourself favour and make the effort to do the tour.

We went to the building on the north side of the street which is a great display of autos. We didn't realize the tour was available for the building on the south side of the street that has 2 more floors of cars plus the musical instruments. Now we will have to go back. Don't make our mistake. See it all while you are there. There is no admission - FREE - and free parking in the lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988chuckb
50,Thought it was only vintage cars. Big surprise with the musical instruments!,"Went with husband and Mother. Both enjoyed the visit, me too.

The experience was an unexpected treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepI9693UV

50,A excellent collection of High Dollar cars in pristine like new condition.,"To get into the multi story building where their classics are located you do need reservations. This collection is part of Merle Norman cosmetics and all events are FREE. One the top floor they have many rare musical instruments and a 5000+ pipe organ. There is a schedule of concerts you need reservations for, but they are also FREE. The past curator was rather stuffy and actually had a dress code, no shorts or inappropriate attire, by their definition. That has changed and no longer required. I guess they finally realized that ""Hey this is Cali, hang loose"" Across the street is a museum of lower quality cars. and in the rear is a locomotive and rail car used by Lucky Baldwin. no reservations required. All in all a excellent tour but think ahead and get those reservations to see the crown jewels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobandmargieg

Before writing this review I read through the 1-3 start reviews to see what bothered people. Unlike any other museum I have visited, the cars are not behind barriers. You can stick your head into the drivers window of the 1933 Duesenberg 20 Grand.Our guide was the museum curator who is also the organ builder/player. The tour was marred 3 times by guests touching a car. One idiot opened the doors of the Delorean and honked the horn. Another fell asleep while standing and dropped a soda narrowly missing a car.This is a free tour of the most amazing private collection of fully restored/operation cars anywhere. All you have to do to fully enjoy it is to obey the rules. Don't touch.Both location must be seen. The collection of hood ornaments, the library , the mechanical Orchestras.

Also this facility features a tour of a Pullman briefly twice a day.

I'm not really that into cars but enjoyed looking at all the variety and attention to detail of these beautiful cars.

That requires an appointment, which we didn't have, but even the reception area had enough to keep us occupied for a good half hour.

They clearly wanted us to share in their love of the collection, and were so effective in sharing their enthusiasm. The collection was termed as functional art, as every car and every mechanical musical instrument and music box works! They played the music from many boxes and insturments, and we were informed that every car goes out for a spin! Everything was just pristine in it's renovated state. IT IS FREE entrance, even free parking! What a lovely treat it all was.You must make reservations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seasides2

In addition to cars from every era, the museum also had several old-time organs that are lovingly maintained. As we were walking by, one of them was open and being serviced. The insides were fascinating, as was the commentary by the man whose job it is to keep them in running condition. Also behind the museum is an old steam locomotive, open to the public. What started out as a reluctant excursion ended up being a most enjoyable outing. There are more organs in a separate building, but this facility was not open the day we arrived. Go! You'll be surprised!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2013_Peg
50,A truly enjoyable 2 hrs,"Prepared to be amazed for two hours. This place is incredible. The time and work that the very knowledgeable staff and volunteers spend keeping everything (except for 2 cars that are to dangerous to start) in perfect working order is obvious. From the two floors of cars to the hood ornaments to the spectacular room of vintage instruments, this place was amazing. I highly recommend it. Remember to spend some time before or after your tour in the museum across the street where you will park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbellc44
50,"Excellent Collection of Cars, Beautifully Displayed, and Free","There are two Nethercutt facilities across the street from one another. One is the Nethercut Museum, which has over 100 classic cars and a restored train, among other things. The other is the Nethercutt Collection, which also has cars as well as decorative items. This review is for the museum, which has longer hours. The Collection is available for tours only and I did not have the opportunity to visit it, although I would like to some day.So let's talk about the museum. I didn't count, but it claims to house 137 cars. These aren't just any old cars, but actually some of the most beautiful luxury and classic cars ever made. Better yet, the family worked hard to restore them all, winning scads of prizes along the way and leaving us with antique cars that look like they never left the showroom.Everyone will have their favorites. The collection starts more or less just before 1900, with most seeming to come from the 1920s-1930s. These include makes such as Deusenberg (which looks like the epitome of wealth and style from the 1930s), early Cadillacs and Lincolns, and an amazing row of Rolls Royces over about a 50 year span.The building itself is basically a large warehouse, but it's even carpeted so it's pleasant to visit.I liked the cars, but even the details were cool. Even the hood ornaments of many of these cars are art pieces. If that's no enough, there are display cases along one side of automotive decorative items, including lots more ornaments (my favorite being a series of decorations based on Egyptian themes of all things).When you walk in the door, you are immediately confronted with one of the most beautiful cars I have ever seen, a 1937 Talbot-Lego Coupe.Admission is free. So is parking.The museum itself is about 20 miles north of LA and easy to reach on the 405. I would note that it's in basically an area of warehouses, so it's not the most attractive setting outside, but that doesn't detract at all from what's available in the interior.They have a classic train in back you can walk up to. They have tours around 12:30 most days if you actually want to go inside.My one quibble (and it is no more than that) is that they have one of the fewer than 50 or so Tuckers in the world, but it's not displayed in a way that shows off some of its unique features (like a 3-headlight system with 2 lights that turn with the wheels). You can see it, but it's hard to see why it was so unique (even if also a failure financially). It may be that while this is a unique car, the level of luxury is not quite up to many others in the collection.The cars are well-labeled with information about the vehicle itself and in some cases their original owners (one I recall was silent film star Rudolph Valentino).The Nethercutt family has been very generous in sharing their collection with all of us - so my thanks to them.If you have an interest in cars or design, this is a fun place to visit. I was glad I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineAndGreg
50,Unbelievable Collection,What an awesome collection of vehicles to see. The collection of full of many gems. The vehicles are in perfect condition as if new and they all work. There is other things to see as well. The musical instruments is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnybaca02
50,Free to view this extensive collection of automobiles and other collectables,"The collection is spread across two vast buildings. Viewing the collection is free however you can only access one of the building as part of a chaperoned tour that runs, at specific times, once or twice a day. The collection isn't open ever day.Nethercutt isn't right in downtown L.A. so you'll need a car to get there.(you can probably do it by public transport with the aid of some sherpas and saintly patience)You really need to get in contact with Nethercutt before you go to make sure that they're going to be open and that you can tour the second building when you visit. Once you've cleared that hurdle you will get access to a huge collection of original or beautifully restores collector cars at no cost.In many countries It is unheard of to access such a vast collection for free. The Petersen Car Museum may have a more diverse display of rarer and unusual cars but the Petersen isn't exactly cheap and Nethercutt has more cars on display.If you love automobiles, particularly US makes, such as Packards, Cords and Cadillacs to name a few, then phone Nethercutt and pay them a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VHD001
40,Plan ahead for the guided tour.,"The Nethercutt Collection was difficult to reach via public transport from our central LA hotel (buses only ran once every hour and not entirely to schedule) which affected our time there. We arrived shortly after the first tour started and, even though the second tour was fully booked, the owners kindly offered to fit us in since we had come a long way. Sadly we couldn't make the second tour either as we didn't trust the returning bus to get us back before our flight home.It was still worth the effort to get there just to wander freely around the first half of the museum and see the amazing vehicles on display. I'd probably just try to plan it better if we were to have the chance to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimMcB66
50,Surprising,I did not expect to find such an interesting and unique museum next to the Merle Norman factory in Sylmar. The museum has an incredible collection of restored autos and orchestriums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb7091954
50,Car Museums are OK -- But this place is WOW!!!,"I've been to Petersen's a couple of times and a few car shows, including rat rods and classics. They are interesting, but not my thing. Even the Nethercutt's public collection, while really nice, didn't blow me away. Then I went on their private tour. OMG!!! It was REALLY IMPRESSIVE! All of the car are pristine and they all work. It was like walking into a showroom for the rich and famous when cars were all the rage and new innovations were always in the works. I was floored. I would highly recommend the private tour (which is free) to see the cars, but there are amazing musical instruments and I loved learning about the woman-owned business that started it all. I highly recommend visiting the Nethercutt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vjh2017
50,Great way to spend the day,"Lots of amazing cars a great museum. Free fun. Learned a few things. Loved the automobiles. Clean, perfect display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinSherwood

50,THIS IS CALIFORNIA's BEST KEPT SECRET,"Didnt know what to expect my wife spotted this on your good site and it was a 90F + day and we pulled up to a very simple plain building walked in and was knocked out. WOW it was like being allowed into a private special world. Great cars with real history. Then we walked across the road for the tour of the ""special selection"" Our guide was so friendly and very knowledgable and we entered another time. Roaring 20s with fabulous decor and priceless cars for us, regular people to enjoy. We were treated as royalty and made our way round the various floors of this hidden gem.Even if you are not a car nut, there is something for anyone who appreciates, history, class days gone by and the passion of the museum to preserve in working order the past. Highlight has to be the massive organ coming up from the floor and being played. I will never forget that.Go visit and see what I mean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1993BIrichardc
50,Nethercutt Experience,"Loved all the old cars, especially arranged by years so u can see changing trends. The official museum has those special cars. We loved the music room upstairs and they played all the old instruments",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spsmd
50,Love this place and I'm not crazy about cars,"Any time someone comes to town, I take them to The Nethercutt Collection. This is a great way to spend a few hours or spend the day. The cars are beautiful with a ton of history. The music room with all of the instruments is spectacular. I'm never bored or get tired of going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeniPartee
50,A Coolectors dream,"This is like no other ""Museum"" you have ever seen. It is a collection of collections. The Nuthercutts spared nothing to provide the public with a beautiful showing of all of the most precious things. Over 50 automobiles, a Pullman rail car and a Pacific Royal Hudson Locomotive, and the world's largest collection of mechanical musical instruments are among the things to be seen and enjoyed.Tours are by reservation, guided tour only. (call 818-364-6464) But, you can easily go on the website and sign up a single or a group (there were 12 of us). Tours are at 10:00 and 1:30 Thursday through Saturday and last about 2 hours -- although ours took a bit longer. If you want to see the Pullman car and locomotive it is open to tour at 12:30 and 3:45 and generally takes about 15 minutes to walk through. (this is not handicap accessible although the rest of the collection is).There is quite a bit of walking for the tour. But there are many chairs and places to take a seat for a while.There is plenty of parkingOne of the most amazing and wonderful things about the Nethercutt is that it is FREE.Next door is the Merle Norman headquarters with a shop available for all to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
50,Fabulous Fascinating Unexpected Treasure,"Truly AMAZING Collection of Antique, Classic & Vintage Automobiles Restored to Perfection!!

50,Amazing,"One of the best collections of cars ive ever seen and trust me when i say ive seen some good cars. First off customer service is great, secondly the food that they gave out was also wonderful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gevorgkara
50,A stunning collection of automobiles,"For my tastes, the Nethercutt Automobile Museum is the best collection of classic, antique and vintage cars anywhere. Admission is free! Unbelievable! I visited three other auto museums and the lowest price was $9 a person for a fair-to-middle museum. This one has nearly 300 cars on the premises and they are in top condition (for the most part). You get to wander and read about some of the finest cars in the world from 1901-1990's. No guide just aisle after aisle of cars. The magnificent 1948 Tucker gets kind of lost in this company.Nearly 100 cars are only seen if you take the Nethercutt Collection Tour (only offered Th, Fr and Sa). If you like cars you must take this tour as well. Don't worry about the ladies, too much. Half of this tour is for the music collection of the Nethercutt family. I wasn't enthralled with this part but it was worth the investment of time.No food on the grounds but take a break from touring, go eat, come back, admission is free!Plenty of parking. Honestly, this is one of the best museum experiences I've ever had. Did I mention that the Nethercutt family does not charge for any of this?Take your camera!!! Before taking a picture of the car, take a picture of the CARD which identifies the picture you are taking.The people who work at this museum are terrific. Free parking and lots of it. Go visit the Nethercutt Automobile Museum!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wind-In-His-Hair
50,outstanding automobile collection and tour,"We were highly impressed with the stunning automobiles, the facility and the tour. Very informative and entertaining. Excellent tour guide. The music box collection and organ were a delightful additions. The Nethercutt should not be missed. Exquisite automobiles. Each one was a jewel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOySters

40,Wonderful Collection of Beautiful Cars,"This is a beautiful museum filled with some of the most elegant cars of the early and mid-20th century. Compared to the cars of today, these were masterpieces of art and craftsmanship. This collection of beautiful pieces includes not only the cars, but exquisite hood ornaments of the same era, headlights, hubcaps, and other memorabilia. One thing I found particularly interesting was a set of miniature tools, housed in a boxed display case. The set included adjustable wrenches, hammers and screwdrivers and each piece is functional. There are even a couple of music machines, one of which played both a violin & piano.One other great attribute to this museum is that thanks to the founders and family of the Merle Norman Cosmetic company, the admission here is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/handymanron
50,Pre-book the tour,The Nethercutt collection was the highlight of our trip to California. In order to see the musical instruments you have to reserve a guided tour. I highly recommend you do this before arriving at the museum in case it is sold out that day. We originally thought we would spend a few hours at this museum but it was so amazing we spent the entire day there. The cars are phenomenal works of art and the guided tour allows you to get very close to them.The musical instrument machines and the pipe organ are indescribable. You won't believe the technology behind these very old players. You have to hear them to believe the incredible sounds some of which are over 100 years old. The tour guide is extremely knowledgeable as well as entertaining and enthusiastic. I just think it's so fantastic that the Nethercutt family allow the public to view their collection instead of locking it away in their private fortresslike most billionaires.I highly recommend this museum. It is not too far outside of Los Angeles and well worth the drive. And the most unbelievable aspect of this museum is that it's 100% free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outdoorpartner
50,Functional fine art,"If you love beautiful things, you'll love this museum!Call in advance so you can take the guided tour. These are offered Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Not only is it free (in Los Angeles, no less) but it also offers garage tours for special groups. Amazing collection, beautifully maintained. And all are drivable.

50,Seems to be a Little Known Gem,"Most ""car people"" seem to know about the Peterson Museum in LA, but few seem to have ever heard of the Neterecutt Museum and the Nethercutt Collection. Mr. Nethercutt was the nephew of Merle Nethercutt Norman of Merle Norman cosmetic fame. There are actually two museums across the street from each other. Both are free. One is open on a regular basis and can be visited any time it's open. The other is an amazing step up. It can be seen with a reservation, only. It includes not only some of the great automobiles of their times, but a recreation of the type of showroom you would have seen these vehicles in back in their day. From their website: ""An amazing collection of automobile mascots, antique furniture, clocks and watches, and one of the worlds finest collections of Mechanical Musical Instruments are displayed in our music room."" Vehicles are restored to original, not overrestored or underrestored. It is an amazing collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankhamil

50,Wonderful collections,I am amazed at the generosity of the Nethercutt family in allowing free access to their collections. So much to see and enjoy.We didn't manage to get to the tour so just saw the motor museum but it is superb. They have a room showing a video about the music machine collection which was fascinating. If we'd had more time we definitely would have booked a tour. So many people whinge about crowds. Maybe they just need to work out their itinerary better. We almost had the place to ourselves for over an hour on a Wednesday morning. Really loved the cars and so beautifully restored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2950POlynnw

I was honestly not looking forward to this because I am not as into cars as my husband and we had done a different car museum in downtown LA the day before... but this one was so much better! I loved that they talk with you some but then give you some freedom too. Plus you get get close to cars and look inside and everything but at other places...most times you can not. There was cars but also instruments, organ, piano, music boxes, car part collections, and so much more. I can not believe they offer all of this free.... such a great thing they are doing. The guy leading tour was very funny and informative. One of the things my husband really liked about this was that everything inside was working... cars are actually taken out yearly and you can sit on the furniture, etc. There were plenty of places to sit so the tour doesn't seem long at all...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kariensean

The train alone is well worth seeing and the Nickelodeons from the European beer gardens. What a fun way to spend a day exploring! A reservation can be made from their web sight, however children under 10 are not admitted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opheliabright
50,Absolutely Fabulous,"We have been several times now and every one is better than the last. Definitely get reservations for the tour, there is so much more than cars and the musical instruments upstairs are unbelievable. The employees doing the tours are super informed and friendly. Everyone from out of town we have taken has been impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sblasingame138
50,"More than Cars, part 2","My wife and I visited about eight months earlier but couldn't stay for the train which has limited viewing times. I returned alone to see the train. While there are many cars, mechanical musical instruments, some furniture, and many other collectables, there is one locomotive and one car.The locomotive is a 1937 Canadian-Pacific Royal Hudson locomotive #2839. It ran in Canada for about 20 years, then pulled a tourist train in the south, and ended up in Pennsylvania about to be scraped when it came to the Nethercutt and was fully restored. The car once belonged to Clara Baldwin Stocker, eldest daughter of E. J. ""Lucky"" Baldwin. In those days, wealthy people owned their own railroad cars and would travel the county in their own home on wheels. The car had been used as a line foreman's car before coming to the Nethercutt and fully restored. Like everything else at the Nethercutt, these items are restored and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,A secret stash of sumptuous vehicles,"Quietly tucked away in the North Valley, a collection built by a private collector is a dazzling sight. It is not modern and new like the Petersen, but is large enough to have you agog, diverse to keep your attention and definitely a place to take your kids for a half day education on what helps us move !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860andrewsk
40,A Hidden Gem in the San Fernando Valley,"If you love classic cars, this is the place to visit. You will be awed by the dazzling collection of perfectly preserved vehicles including some of the best ever created. While the Peterson Museum caters for tourists, the Nethercutt Collection is for the serious automobile enthusiast. If you have time, book ahead for the guided tour which takes you through much more than the automobile gallery. The collection also includes an eclectic array of musical artifacts and instruments, antique furniture and other grand objects. The Nethercutt Collection is a neighborhood gem hidden in the San Fernando Valley that most locals don't know about, and is well worth the visit. Visitors to LA can drive or catch an Uber to this location. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidaussie
50,A Great Treat - and much more than Antique Cars!!!,"The Nethercutt Collection was founded by J.B. Nethercutt, who was a co-founder of Merle Norman Cosmetics in 1931, along with his Aunt, Merle Nethercutt Norman. The Collection is actually two buildings located in the warehouse district of Sylmar (northern Los Angeles area). The first building is the Collection's Museum, which is open for self-guided tours from Tuesday thru Saturday, and contains the majority of the collection's antique cars (mostly pre-1950) that are displayed on a large showroom-type floor. When you visit, you will typically park in the Museum's parking lot and visit the Museum while you wait to tour the Collection.The rest of the Collection is housed in a non-descript, brown, stucco, 6-story building across the street from the Museum. You can only tour this building on Thursdays thru Saturdays, via a guided tour that lasts about 2 hours. Our Saturday 10 AM tour was about 40 people and was led by Kyle Irwin, the curator of the Collections Musical Instruments, and a docent named Hank. You must make a reservation for the tour ahead of time (we made ours the day before) and get confirmation from the Collection's staff that your reservation is accepted. As there are typically only 4 tours a week (one each on Thursday and Friday, two on Saturday), you’ll need to arrange your travel plans to be in Sylmar/Santa Clarita at the right time to get a tour spot. You'll be glad you did.The Museum and Collection tour are completely free - they don't even solicit donations - and have been since 1971. The only concession to revenue is a small Merle Norman Cosmetics boutique which is located next to the Collection building. The other note, regarding the Collection tour, is that their elevator is being modernized, and won't be operational most of 2016. Hence, you’ll have to climb some stairs during the tour which visits four different levels in the building. The stairs, however, are not steep and, in many cases, you’ll be so engrossed with the tour you won’t notice the mild climbs. You are also permitted to sit on the antique chairs and furniture that you’ll come across during the tour.The tour starts in the Lower Salon which contains several more antique cars as well as some antique musical instruments, music boxes, dolls, and furniture. Unlike the Museum, these vehicles are not roped off so you can get close to them, stick your head in the windows, etc. without touching them. The guide explains that all the Collection’s vehicles have been restored to pristine, like-new quality, are fully functional and are maintained, restored, and regularly “exercised” by the Collections own staff. Many of the vehicles have won “best in show” prizes at famous Auto shows around the world, so the vehicles are very expensive and can be admired from up close, but not touched. (As a reminder that the vehicles are operational, the ignition keys are left hanging in each of the cars.) The Tour’s second level is the Grand Salon - a fancy antique car showroom which contains the Collection’s prized Duesenberg and other prized automobiles. To heighten the ambiance, the tour guide turned on a “replicating” piano that played Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" while we looked around the area and admired the furniture and other high-end vehicles from back in the day when cars were the toys of the rich and famous and were the epitome of luxury. The tour’s third level is on the Mezzanine veranda where they have a number of antique phonographs, a large statue (the “Spirit of the West” I believe) cast entirely in silver, and a collection of over 1,000 antique hood ornaments.The fourth, top level is the Music Room that contains a number of reproducing pianos, orchestrions, and the Wurlitzer Pipe Organ – one of the largest in the World – with the pipes built into the walls of the room. Kyle had selections played from the various orchestions (large, mechanized, multi-instrumental, automatic music players), with the final “performer” being the Organ itself. The Organ played the theme from Phantom of the Opera, and later a rendition of “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”, to complete a wonderful, almost magical, tour experience. They apparently have several free concerts in the Music Room at various times during the year. I’ll definitely be on the look-out for those next time we travel to Los Angeles.We did not get a chance to see the fully-restored antique train and luxury rail car located behind the Museum. That will be on our agenda for the next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9788XZandrewp
50,Amazing collection,Make sure you take a trip here to see their collection of both cars and music instruments playing by themselves. To see everything you have to sign up for a guided tour of about two hours. Both me and my wife enjoyed ourselves even though she couldn't care less about cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872kjetils

This is such an impressive collection of vehicles and the third floor has what they call ""Functional Art"" orchesters (player orchestras in a box) player musical instruments even mechanical banjos, a Wurlitzer and occasionally they have concerts on the Wurlitzer. This is my favorite place in the entire collection. The cars are impressive and the stories behind them are very interesting. Check out the 20 Grand a 1933 Duesenberg, and Fatty Arbuckle's car, Maybe you're a fan of Cecil B Demille his car is there too. It's free, it's fun, it's unforgettable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PastorC_12

50,This museum should be on every automobile lovers bucket list!,"Little known by locals, this museum hosts some of the most wonderful automobiles ever created. Because it is a very out of the way site, the museum does not get the guests it deserves. You should make it a point if checking out this museum website and scheduling a visit. There is very little in restaurants in the area or other types of stops. But, this museum is awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8495JLmichaelg
50,A Gem.,"The Nethercutt Collection is absolutely amazing...vintage cars, nickelodeons, music boxes, dolls, large assortment of radiator hood ornaments, world class collection of automated mechanical instruments and so much more.

50,A Hidden Gem!,"In the midst of an industrial area of Sylmar is this wonderful hidden gem of a museum. The automobile collection is stunning (from the early 1900's though the 1970's). The memorabilia is outstanding (headlights, hood ornaments, etc). You can even tour inside a 1937 locomotive and 1912 Pullman car that was used as private transportation (tours are twice a day). The kids....and yes, even I...enjoyed ringing the bell of the 1937 Canadian Pacific Royal Hudson Locomotive. I have been to the Petersen and while their collection is nice, this one really impressed me....and it is free! You and the kids will enjoy this one. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryD813

50,"Great museum, great cars","We visited Nethercutt on the 8th of July. The collection of automobiles is incredible. We saw a lot of cars we had never heard of before, let alone seen. Getting to go inside the 1936 motor home was quite a treat, the wood work inside was absolutely beautiful. We also visited the Petersen on our trip, but this museum was far superior to that one. If you are interested in cars, I highly recommend the Nethercutt!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561laurim

50,A GEM THAT MOST LOCALS DO NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT,"Tucked away in a multistory building that looks out of place in Sylmar is a fantastic collection of cars, timepieces and music ""makers"". The collection is beyond belief and the entrance price is FREE, but apply way ahead for reservations. Everything has been restored to its original condition and everything works. There are additional autos in the building across the street which you can enter without a reservation. If you are a car buff, just this exhibit will blow you away. A big thank you to the Nethercutt's and Merle Norman Cosmetics for making this priceless collection available to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDave
50,Heaven for Car Connoisseurs,"My friend and I love old cars. We also love free stuff. We were amazed by the outstanding collection of antique and classic autos displayed at the Nethercutt Collection. Admission is free! The extensive collection includes cars we had never heard of, collections of hood ornaments, head lights, music boxes, etc, a library and a fully restored, early 20th Century Pullman car. Each auto lists the specifications, original price and the owner (if known).The guides are friendly and knowledgable and will gladly answer any questions. I have visited lesser museums and paid to get in, so this collection was truly a treat. Photos are permitted. Did I mention it's free?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zippychic
50,A prestine collection of antiques that should not be missed from cars to orchestrions.,"We joined a FREE tour of the multi floor collection of antiques. There were automobiles from the 1900's through 1930's that had been completely restored to perfect condition which included original Benz, original Mercedes, a Duesenberg and other European and American built vehicles. The floors between the ground floor and the last displayed floor contained Nickelodeons, music boxes, David Winter Cottages, dolls, coins, crystal figurines, a fantastic crystal chandelier, and automobile collectibles such as vintage hood ornaments. The final floor was the Music Room with a world class collection of mechanical instruments including pianos, Nickelodeons, music boxes, orchestrions, a mighty Wurlitzer Theater, a pipe organ, a grand piano, and a Louis XV style dining room. If you are not familiar with an orchestrion, it is a machine that looks like an expensive piece of furniture and plays music. It is designed to sound like an entire orchestra or band. Some were wall sized and all were completely restored and demonstrated. As beautiful as they were to look at, once the music started it grabbed the attention of everyone there. If you have a few hours to spend in a nice air conditioned building, I hope you go to see this fabulous and diverse collection. The gentleman who provided the dialog is extremely interesting and knowledgeable, having restored and/or maintained the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854nancyt
50,An Automotive Extravaganza & more,"We love this free automotive museum. We made reservations to be sure we got to see the Nethercutt collection. We've been there many times, but the first time was an eye popper. The cars here are unique luxury automobiles that are hard to find anywhere else. My favorite was the 1933 Duesenberg. My wife loved the upstairs collection of music boxes. We were amazed to see and hear the demonstration of the Wurlitzer Pipe Organ, which they still use for silent movie nights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
50,Amazing Tour and Guide! And it's FREE!,"First let me say how SHOCKED I am that this collection is 100% free. No admission fee, nobody asked for a tip, no gift shop or snack bar. ZERO cost involved.There are 2 buildings across the street from one another. The first that we stopped in is one level (""The Museum"") and they pointed across the street to let us know where to go for our (reserved) tour (""The Collection""). That building has multiple levels (and in June, 2016 had an elevator that was under repair, and they were kind/professional enough to warn everyone about that before booking a tour. It is supposed to be repaired by November or December, 2016).We had arrived early, so we spent some time in the one level building with the antique cars. AMAZING! The condition of the cars is fantastic. Highlights for my boyfriend and I were the Tucker, a Jaguar E-Type and a 1938 Lincoln Model K. There were Packards, Caddy's, Pierce Arrows to name a few. Beautiful.An added bonus: we were also there in time for one of 2 daily tours of a locomotive and private rail car located behind the 1 story building. Per their website: Custom built by Pullman in Chicago, Illinois for Clara Baldwin Stocker the eldest Daughter of local Pioneer ""Lucky"" Baldwin. This rail car has been beautifully restored back to 1912.Eventually we made our way across the street to the main collection. But, it's not JUST cars. They have an amazing collection of automated mechanical musical instruments. Our tour guide (AMAZING!) is the one and only person who is responsible for maintaining these beautiful musical/mechanical treasures. He was a delight! The 4th floor music room is astounding. Very interesting and we got to hear a good sampling of music from these antiquities.I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation and taking a tour of this museum. It's a definite MUST - DO when visiting Los Angeles (it's located in Sylmar, CA, FYI).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jahhp

50,Unique and incredible collection.,"Free yo the public- Have you seem 10 Phantom Rolls Roy's side to side each from different eras and that belong to famous people? They have them here. If you are in the area this is an incredible place to visit. Most places have several nice cars, but here you can see one of a kind stuff. They have a vehicle which there is only one in the whole world.Each car has a card that talks about the specs and also how much it cost when new.On non-rainy days, which are most here in Southern California you can get a tour of a beautifully restored luxury train car - it used to belong to a rich family and this was their private form of transportation. They also have a Canadian locomotive.Kids can go inside and ring the bell. This is really fun!!Lots of pictures opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez

An unbelievable HUGE collection of antique cars, furniture, musical instruments, a train (!), and many other fine objects...all on display in this huge multistory museum (actually two buildings across the street from each other). They also have concerts (I've been to several) and show silent movies.

50,LOVE THIS EXHIBIT - MANY TIMES OVER,"Everytime I'm in the area, have to see this collection. If you haven't seen this yet, you should.

50,FREE and Wonderful Cars!,Visited with the family and it is a wonderful place to view beautiful vehicles and display. We also caught the train exhibit which is not open all day so check the schedule. Same for the exhibit across the street. You need to make a reservation and because we just stopped while driving though we only watched a video of it and it looked really cool with one of a kind musical items. A must do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2474HVjeffm
50,Rare opportunity,"Knew they had antique automobiles. Actually 285, restored to original condition. What we didn't know, was their collection of early 1900's musical self playing machines. On the 4th floor is their music room. On 3 sides are astounding music machines. At the center is an organ, bought from an old cinema in Denver. The pipes are behind opened curtains in the room. They give 6 concerts and silent movies during the year. And it is all free. But you have to make reservation on line ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lancesba
50,The Collection is incredible!,"We reserved a collection tour in advance, and it was fabulous. They had music boxes that I didn't even know existed.

I highly recommend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckBrooks
40,More Impressive than expected,"As a native Michigander, I have seen numerous and significant car collections. The Nethercutt was a last-minute stop between other sites.

50,Charming Experience! Hidden Gem! Definitely Worth Visiting!,"The Nethercutt Collection is a surprising little gem of a museum. Tucked away in the hills of the San Fernando Valley, I would have never known this museum existed had it not been recommended to me by a family member. Filled with beautiful old time cars and other vintage memorabilia, this treasure trove is a charming place to visit for an afternoon. Be aware that you must reserve a tour time well in advance (plan on scheduling a time months before you plan to visit), but, incredibly, admission is free. For me, the most breath-taking part of the tour is the grand finale at the end. Tour guests are ushered into a room filled with beautifully detailed (polished wood and brass) automated instruments. The center-piece is an incredible Wurlitzer theater organ which I found to be just breath-taking. I was in awe of the magnificence of these wonderful instruments that fill the room with an amazing symphony of sound coming out of just a handful of intricate and lovely machines. It is hard to fully describe it, but I really was taken aback by the quality of the experience and how the instruments re-created the sounds of a full orchestra. I would highly recommend the Nethercutt Collection to anyone who appreciates luxurious old-time cars and antiques and who is looking for a very uniquely satisfying experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanw921
50,Amazing does not do it justice,"Where do I begin to tell the story of something amazing. This hidden gem in Sylmar, California should be compulsory viewing for all fans of historical cars and musical instruments from the 1800's up to the 40's and beyond. Firstly this is completely free, yes I said free. A collection that commenced in the 50's with Mr JB and Mrs Dorothy Nethercutt has grown and grown and what we saw today was outstanding. In the museum, which is on one side of the street are cars from the early days, one of the most impressive collections of Rolls Royce that I have ever seen. Then go over to the other side of the street where timed visits to the four floors awaits (check the website). Kyle brought the magic of this unbelievable private collection to life. The music room brought tears to my eyes when the orchestrions sprang into life. Words do not do this place justice, please please go see it for yourself. Thank you Mr and Mrs Nethercutt Senior and Junior for the privilege of being able to experience the magic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redcetera
50,Hidden jewel... an absolute MUST-SEE!!,"I wish I could give this a six star-rating because five just doesn't do it justice! I'm a local and was looking for new things to do in LA and found this jewel after much digging. It's the most amazing collection of priceless classic cars and man-made musical instruments. Awe-inspiring pieces of work you just don't see anymore. Our tour guide Kyle--who was also a full-time staffer responsible for the upkeep of the instruments--was so passionate and excited, you just couldn't help but get sucked into the stories he was sharing about each piece and the era from which they came. The end of the tour was an AMAZING concert demonstration of one of the few Wurlitzer organs built for silent movie theaters. These are the same computer generated sounds you hear in movies today; the difference is these sounds are produced by thousands of man-made organ pipes that surround you. This tour is perfect for enthusiasts as cars, music, as well as mechanical engineers, and history buffs. Truly breathtaking. A must-see for locals and visitors alike. And by the way, it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCACUNA

Took me less than an hour.Wall of rolls royces, vw, couple of classic vettes, mid 80s Cadillac limo.I did not do the collection which is in another building and tours reservations are required and only occur two days aweek.Above average if you like really old cars...I would rather hang with the 50s, 60s and 70s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,"""Over the Top"" Wonderful","One of the best museums/collections I have ever toured, the Louvre of automobile and specialized musical instrument collections. Outstanding!I thought about this collection as an auto museum, but it is so much more. There are 264 absolutely beautifully restored cars. Several are OVER 100 years old, all of them actually run, and all of them sparkle and shine better than they did when they were new.But beyond the cars, there are other collections, including some porcelain objects, some gold eating utensils and lots of automobile hood ornaments. Beyond these, however, a fantastic collection of working musical devices, centering around a 5,000 pipe organ, a 97 key piano and some wonderful collection of orchestral players (devices that actually play several musical devices) are demonstrated. Much like old player pianos, these devices use various forms of drivers to cause them to play pre-selected music independently. The organ is coordinated with the oversized piano and our guide, the museum’s curator, had the two play 3 compositions. Each of the orchestral devices also played for us. One of these devices actually played 4 violins and another played several instruments including even a a bass drum.This is really one of the most unusual and impressive museums I’ve ever been to. But you won’t get to see it all unless you sign up in advance for one of the guided tours.And, oh yes, it’s all free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6953YVpaull

That said, all the cars in this museum look like they've come straight off the production line. We didn't have the guided tour of the cars, but it would appear you must have a guided tour of the train carriage outside the museum, which was very interesting.

The collection is heavily tilted towards the 1930s, but with a ton of extremely well restored and maintained cars.The portion of the Collection with the mechanical musical instruments, we were a bit sceptical about, but it ended up being pretty interesting.The old CPR engine was also neat, given we're Canadian and have a family history with the CP company.Overall, a great experience, and it's all 100% free, thanks to the generosity of the Nethercutt family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamsE5726RZ

I went with my husband and a friend, who are both interested in cars and I tagged along, not expecting to,find much of interest. How wrong I was, the cars are truly magnificent and beautiful. The collection of musical instruments was also,outstanding. On the top level of the museum, our guide played each of the ""automatic musical centre"" that were used in USA during the silent movie era, we all enjoyed this wonderful experience sitting on antique chairs and couches.

Antique musical equipment,a beautiful refurbished organ and antique furniture can be seen here.Across the street from the Nethercutt is another free auto museum and NO RSERVATIONS required, No formal tour, you wander around at your leisure.

50,Guys will drool!,"This has to be the premier collection of antique, classic and unique automobiles ever assembled under one roof, and the best part is the auto museum is free, just walk in. Across the street, however, is a faciinating collection of music carillons, and you guessed it, more cars. This side of the street is also free, but you have make arrangements in advance and a group is required. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdashnaw
50,Must see,"It's out of the way, but it's worth the effort. Wonderful cars in a unique setting that makes the viewing special. A la those TV offers, ""Wait, there's more."" They have an exhibit of magnificent functioning automated music instrument combos of a quality I have never seen before. They end with a demo of the most impressive unit with an accompanying light show that is just fabulous. By the way, it's a guided tour and the docents were excellent. They have a lovely dining room and they get free food. They deserve it.They have more cars on display across the street in an unadorned space. They're great, but it's not the same experience.The best thing is that they are both free. Just remember that you need to go to their website and make a reservation way in advance. This is wildly popular and and fills up way in advance. Plus the Collection is only open a couple tours a couple of days a week. We kept missing out seeing this on several previous trips because we did not try to reserve early enough and was locked out and also because we weren't in the vicinity on the days it is open. This time we made certain that we were able to go and we're glad we made the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJJC_Family
50,A. secret museum in Los Angeles,"The Naethercutt is not well known but is a wonderful experience. There are two tours each day and reservations are a requirement. The main focus is antique cars from the 1890s to current. The Dusenberg on display in the main showroom is worth millions. But with over 200 vehiicles on display, there are cars for every interest. The mezzanine has antique players and furniture plus hundreds of hood ornaments on display. The top floor has multiple mechanical music instrument and the second largest theatre organ in the country. Both the organ and a Bergdorf piano are controlled from a computer and each tour concludes with a concert. October feature ghostly music and December is CHRISTMAS MUSIC. No charge for tours and there is a Meril Norman store next door. Across the street is a large building with probably 200 cars. Behind the building is a large railroad engine and private Pullman car commissioned by the daughter of Lucky Baldwin. We have visited at least a dozen times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsadon
50,Amazing all around! Leaves you speechless!,"I can't say enough about this museum. It was the first place we visited upon arriving to LA- and it was a hit! If you are a fan of cars and music this should absolutely be on your list to visit. The car collection is priceless, with over 100 cars. Although, I have to say, the musical part of the tour was my favorite. We reserved for the tour, which made it so much more fun and informative. Great for kids of all ages! Can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgv_72
40,Interesting Museum,This is the collection of one family with a passion for classic cars.It is very interesting and the only museum of this type that has a carpet across the whole area.It has a collection of mainly American cars dating from the early 1900 onwards.It is a long way out from LA so be prepared for the drive. It is located in an industrial area right near to the family Cosmetics Manufacturing unit upon which the collection was founded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveo334
50,AMAZING CAR MUSEUM stuck in an industrial area of Burbank,"First of all it's free - which is amazing to me, because it's got some jaw-dropping cars; almost all of which are in immaculate original (or restored) condition.From the moment you walk in the front door you are wowed by the most fantastic car you'll ever see - a 1937 Talbot-lago. Words cannot describe how spectacular this rare car is... it's only one of fourteen coupes ever built.Then you walk down aisles and aisles and just feel like a little kid, mesmerized...There's easily 100 cars dating from the first Model-T through to the 1930's. (A few others from the 50's and 60's were tossed in, but mainly it's the early era.) And they are STUNNING! Each comes with an ID to give you the history of ownership.It's simply fascinating ...and a real fun way to kill a few hours. (Check out Rudolph Valentino's original car!)There's even a display case filled with toy car replicas and other classic car accoutrements (horns, tassels, etc.)PS - there's a 2nd building (that apparently makes this one pale by comparison) but it's by ""appointment only"" for a personal tour.)If you're in the area - it's a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanuckGirl2007
50,Interesting even if you are not a classic car fan!,What's not to like about a gorgeous free museum with lots of interesting cars? They open early and have sparkling clean restrooms.

50,Beautiful variety of cars & kid fun,"Second floor has a special area just for kids. Even mom enjoyed that area the most because they have a car pulled apart to teach you how a car engine and drivetrain works. You can borrow an iPad in the kids area for a fun scavenger hunt to build your own race car and once completed, race Lighting McQueen.Recently remodeled museum is beautiful with tv/movie cars on level 3, exotic royal cars on level 1 and beautiful cars everywhere.Easy to park in the parking garage. Informal food brought in and available on the 4th floor. Only cold items like green salads, pre made sandwiches, bottled drinks, chips, and fruit. Very informal, food brought in with coolers and set up on plastic tables-but hits the spot at lunch time as you dine in a glass room on the roof.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDL2D

50,Hidden Gem,"This museum is definitely a hidden gem! Off the beaten path but filled with beautifully restored cars. I did both the self guided browse through the museum and also the (free) guided tour through the Nethercutt Collection across the street. Cars on the first level, music boxes and hood ornaments up the stairs, and then the most fascinating music display on the third floor. The music room was by far my favorite part of the tour - they have several orchestrions and theater organ that turns out to be much cooler than you think it's going to be. If you have the time and have any interest in cars or music, definitely check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahMynah
50,An absolutely phenomenal museum...,"For many years, I had wanted to see the Nethercutt Museum, and last weekend, I finally made it there.

50,The Coolest Museum You Might Have Never Heard Of,"In all the years I’ve been going to different museums in Southern california, this might be my biggest (and most pleasant) surprise. I recently read about a place called the Nethercutt Museum, located in nearby (well, for me) Sylmar, CA. All I knew about it was that it had some cars and musical instruments, and even better for a semi-retired guy, it was FREE!. I booked a tour online and from the time when I entered the museum to the time I left 3 1/2 hours later (guided tour is 2 hours) I was totally blown away.Besides classic automobiles (the Grand Salon has to be seen to be believed), the guided tour of the “Collection” also includes some of the most fascinating automated musical instruments you’ll ever see or hear. You haven’t listened to music until you've heard a European Orchestration! Oh yeah, you get to go on a train, too.In the Music Room the big-ticket item in this room is the 5,000 (5,132 to be exact) pipe Mighty Wurlitzer Theater Organ. This organ (built in 1907) played in theaters showing silent movies providing both music and sound effects for the audience. The curator said this Wurlitzer was designed to “take you to some place special” and to “escape.” He played some of the sound effects for us. The organ was retired in 1940.Also in the room is the world’s heaviest piano. Valued at $2 million dollars, it also has 97 keys instead of the regular 88. For the final 15 minutes we heard the organ and the piano play in unison. The room went dark, a couple of curtains opened, and we were able to view some of the colorful pipes of the organ (the pipes actually surround the room). These two incredible instruments combined for perhaps the best version of Ghost Riders In The Sky I’ve ever heard, and ended with the Chattanooga Choo Choo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithMaiTaiTom
50,Cars and More!,"This is called an Automotive museum but it's much more. Probably one of the finest musical museums in the world also, including some very rare and large musical machines (as big as a wall). Many cars are award winners, including Best of Show at Pebble Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blubs99
50,Incredible cars & music devices!,"This was my second visit. On the first, we missed the main museum but got to see the beautiful cars across the street and the vintage train. Just recently, we were amazed at the extensive marble everywhere surrounding the crown jewels of the auto collection. The huge music boxes (nicer than calliopes) that play symphonies on the top floor will blow you away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilsonandAgnes
50,Organ envy!,"The trip to hear the theatre organ was terrific! There are so many interesting exhibits here, including car hood ornaments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKharleyrider
50,A Hidden Gem,"The Nethercutt Museum is a hidden gem. It is a wonderful car museum in its own right rivaling the better known Petersen Museum, but the collection of music machines makes it a unique treat. In a digital world we forget the wonder of the analog machines both cars and music players that came before what we have now. The Netehrcutt does a wonderful job of celebrating this world and has the resources to do it well. The tour guides were very knowledgeable, with a sense of fun and a dash of whimsy. If you love cars come prepared to sped at least a couple of hours to look at some of the rarest vehicles around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShakerRon
50,Must see for car and music lovers,Great museum featuring the auto and mechanical musical instuments from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the great auto collections in the USA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ares949
50,Free entry to WOW!!!,"The museum which is of the self guided version has a plethora of interesting cars; my wife fell in love with the 1936 Pierce Arrow Travelodge Trailer (which you are allowed into!) while the 1937 Limousine pulling was not to shabby either as both in the same stunning dark blue paint.While the rest of the cars are of course ""do not touch!"" you get so close to all of them that the trick is to keep your hands in your pocket...Out back they happen to have a restored ""Canadian Pacific Royal Hudson"" steam engine while up front there is a jaw-dropping Talbot-Lago (sorry if it has moved when you visit) - the rest of the cars are all shining examples of automotive restorations.I made one mistake which allowable since staying privately for a few weeks, but not if from out of town on a schedule and that was not reading the entire website on opening days/times! Make sure you arrive on a day the Museum and The Collection is open! They close Sun/Mon/Tues when there is a Federal (Monday) holiday and The Collection (across the street) is only open Thu/Fri/Sat but YOU NEED A RESERVATION! This can be made via email or phone or at the Museum front desk. I did not know what to expect and I figured it would be similar to the Peterson Museum vault as the guided tour starts in the basement, but boy was I wrong! The basement is like the h'ordeuvres to a sumptuous meal which starts in the ""Auto Salon"" upstairs which is filled with some of the nicest Packards and other goodies I have ever seen. The rest of the tour meanders upstairs via musical and automotive memorabilia to the music room which is expertly guided by the curator who restores these magnificent instruments. Even total gear heads will appreciate this; on my bucket list now is one of their few silent movie nights! I have also asked my wife and daughter to favor Merle Norman Cosmetics as this nice, paternalistic company keeps this nice facility running - and yes they do have an outlet next door (no hard sale though)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norway_in_Stamford
50,Gorgeous Restored Classic Cars and More...Free,"Go for the beautiful, meticulously restored classic automobiles and stay for the amazing 1918 Wurlitzer Theater pipe organ performance.There are actually two museum to see. The Nethercutt Museum is a collection of about 120 restored to full operating condition classic automobiles. The museum is free and you walk through at your own pace so you can enjoy the amazing detail of each car. Most of the cars are from the 1930's but there are some older and some newer, even a beautifully restored front wheel drive fire truck. There is a restored antique camper trailer and one car left in the condition it was in when it was purchased so you can imagine and understand why it takes them over a year to research and restore each car to it's original specifications which is all done by their own personal team of restoration experts.The second museum is in the large building across the street, The Nethercutt Collection. To see this collection you must sign up for a two hour guided tour. Tours are usually offered on Thursday, Friday, Saturday at 10am and 1:30pm. Though it seems like a long day, I encourage you to not miss the opportunity to do this fabulous tour. I had to schedule for a different day and afterwards, I was so glad I did. The collection has about 100 more classic cars, including the first one the Nethercutt's restored and so much more. You first see the lower level where there are numerous cars including a DeLorean and another fire truck. Keep in mind that every vehicle is operational including the 1914 electric car (be sure to read this placard) to the old single piston model. Next you go up to the magnificent ""showroom"" which is beautiful and contains the first restored car. Here the guide, who does an amazing job of telling the history of the cars and the auto industry, tells of the thousands of automobile manufacturers that once existed in the US. The collection also contains numerous mechanical musical machines, also lovingly restored to full working condition and you get to hear many playing along the way. Most from Germany and Austria where the art of making such players, that could play any instrument, was world renowned. On the third floor is a display of hood ornaments and antique furniture and finally you ascend the final spiral staircase to the music hall. Here are some of the most fabulous mechanical music players you will ever see. Machines that play violins, accordions and every imaginable instrument. They play four are five of the them while you tour the room. There is also a 97 key piano. Very rare.The room also includes a beautiful Louis XIV dining room where the Nethercutt's entertain guest. But the grand finally is worth the visit in and of itself. The gentleman who maintains all of the beautiful instruments also plays them, explains in detail the Wurlitzer Theater organ that is the center piece, with it's over 5000 pipes and musical instruments, it was used during the era of silent movies to play sounds and music to accompany the film. It is the third largest of it's type in the world. To end your tour hearing this instrument play pieces from Phantom of the Opera and other great musical scores will leave you with goosebumps.Our two guides were informative, funny and extremely knowledgeable and an absolute delight. This is one place I left experiencing far more than I ever expected.Allow 2 hours for the collection tour and about 1 1/2 hour for the museum.Also there is a beautifully restored private train parlor car behind the museum that you can view a few times a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennessee50plus
50,Elderly people love old cars!,"I read about this in a magazine. Had visitors who loved antique cars. This was the perfect place to visit. It is a little distance from Orange County but well worth the drive. The amount of cars thy have on exhibition is extraordinary. They feature cars that Hollywood stars owned.

20,Website info for this attraction missleading!,"15 years ago I visited this Collection and spent the entire day, it was so amazing. I remembered that we could call and set up an hour ""private"" tour to enhance the visit (which we did) and it was great. So when planning another trip down the coast from Monterey to San Diego, I set up the same private tour (they offer 10:00 and 1:30 tour times). However; our plans changed a bit and I realized the day I chose for the private tour wouldn't work so I called to change it. They advised me there were no tours available for the new date. I said, okay; we'll just skip the private part and come anyway. The woman said fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/490cherylb

It has an orchestrina (a huge music making cabinet) that mechanically plays real violins. The Wurlitzer organ has 4 manuals and more stops than any organ I have ever seen. It is the 3rd largest theater pipe organ in the world. This museum would be incredible if it only contained the musical instruments. It also contains some of the rarest cars in the world. There are cars in both the Nethercutt Collection and the Nethercutt Museum. There is a Bugati, several Duesenbergs, and some of the rarest Rolls-Royces. There is one car that there was only about 100 of the model made.If you visit Nethercutt, you should reserve a place on the tour of the Nethercutt Collection.

50,A Lot More than Cars,"This was my third visit and my wife's second. It never fails to please.Some people think of it as a car museum, but it is much more. There are two buildings, the original four-story tower of the collection by guided tour only and the newer one story self-guided museum.The tower with the ""Collection"" is four floors. Floor one has cars, miniatures, dolls, and other objects. Floor two is based on a car dealership of the 1920s, a grand salon of car sales. This floor is mostly cars. The third floor is mostly small objects and some mechanical music players. A long case is filled with beautiful hood ornaments. A one and a half circular stair takes the tour to the fourth floor which is filled with mechanical music devices, player pianos, musical watches, more small objects, a reproduction Louis XIV dining room, and the ""mighty Wurlitzer organ"". It is all very impressive.The museum is mostly cars. There is a fire engine. A long case has small objects, car miniatures, and a few railroad miniatures. The reason for the trains is that outside is a real locomotive and a beautiful private railroad car, seen twice a day at 12:20 and 3:45 for 15 minutes each tour.We missed the railroad exhibit but it's close enough to home that we plan to see it another time.The entire complex is free, a price that I can afford.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

50,"Cars aren't my thing, but this place is fascinating","What I like about this place is that the cars are displayed in two, cavernous showrooms, not sectioned off in rooms. This helped history come to life for me. I've seen many of these cars on ancient film and newsreels, but never in person. I was thoroughly enchanted.Outside of the outstanding car collections, they also have a pristine Hudson train engine and ""Lucky"" Baldwin daughter's 1912 private pullman car you can climb through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjnkira

30,"So Great, but So Lousy at the Same Time","It is difficult for me to properly review the Nethercutt Collection because I am conflicted about the experience.On the one hand, the collection of automobiles and especially the musical instruments is superb. We were able to get close enough to some of the most beautiful cars in order to see inside them, and the curators opened the doors and hoods on some so that we could get a closer look. The musical instruments, from music boxes to sophisticated orchestrions surpassed anything I’ve seen elsewhere, and the opportunity to see and hear them in action was a magical and moving experience.So what’s my problem? It was the mediocre tour experience. The tour is free and, as a result, a large number of people want to attend, and the management seems to have trouble saying “Enough.” There were far too many people on the tour, making it difficult to access some of the cars while the tourists needed to have pictures of themselves taken with the members of the collection. Also, due to the size of the crowd, most people didn’t listen or follow instructions very well. I was amazed at how rude some of the crowd was. Despite the curators repeated requests not to touch the cars, I had to scold one idiot myself because he leaned his cane up against the painted bodywork of a beautiful Pierce-Arrow so he could take a photo of his wife! As a result, the curator spent much of her time acting as a shrill and annoying commandant. Once she had finished with her pre-packaged spiels it was difficult to get her to answer questions because she was too preoccupied with keeping the group corralled and moving according to her schedule. Other docents were similarly distracted and inaccessible.My wife and I departed with mixed emotions. We visit a lot of similar museums were frustrated with how aggravating and annoying the visiting experience was, and how it detracted so much from our ability to enjoy the collection. I’d much rather see them charge admission for the tours and keep the crowds down to a manageable size.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdl50cc
50,Merle Norman collection,"I have been visiting this collection since the 1970's. I love to see all the old cars. They are meticulously cared for. There are many other things to see here also, such as musical instruments and china, etc. It is a must see. I remember when Merle Norman owned the place and we would see him take one of those cars out every day. I just love the place and I think you would also. It is a fabulous collection of so many things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ibizan_Yankee
50,This is a MUST on your list - MAKE TIME to visit Nethercutt,"You will NOT be disappointed.Originally, we wanted to go to Petersen Museum, but they were closed for renovation. After researching options, we decided on Nethercutt AND the private tour (you need to call ahead!!!!). I was ""in awe"" the entire tour. We could have spent 4 hours easily (the private tour is about 2 hours).This museum gives you a real taste of the finer cars of the 20's, 30's, and 40's. Mr. Nethercutt got ""hooked"" on cars when he rebuilt his first and WON AT PEBBLE BEACH. No wonder - I would be hooked too.We were slightly disappointed we didn't see the engines (hoods were all closed) - but this is a very impressive collection. While the Nethercutt's are now deceased, their tradition lives on and the organization continues to restore automobiles (and train cars!).The tour is extra special - I don't want to tell you... just take my word and call for a private tour reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/359tammit

The museum across the street is multi-level and even larger. In addition to old pristine cars, there is also a collection of calliopes and other musical machines, as well as a Wurlitzer Organ.

40,Great museum - Staff not so much,"If you have the time, you must go see this museum. Lots (over 200) of old cars in the main section (although parked almost too close to really appreciate) and a locomotive and pullman car to see out back. A few times/week they allow you to go into the secondary ""museum"" where there are more cars and a small doll display in the basement, more expensive cars in the first floor salon that were tightly packed in, second floor with hood ornaments and some furniture that honestly looked like they were there because the Nethercutt's redecorated their own house (not impressed), and a fourth floor with a Wurlitzer organ and nickelodeons.The tour guides , Skip and Kyle were definitely the minus to the tour. They were very rude and snippy. Kyle was extremely condescending to the crowd and acted as though HE personally owned everything in the place. They were full of themselves because they were in charge of the collection and Kyle certainly thinks he is above the rest of us, boasting about his 25 cent lunches and all of the fringe benefits (free dental and $2 crowns)he gets from working there. They definitely need to tone it down. More so, constantly talking down to people and treating them as thought they are children is unacceptable. I understand that they do not want people touching the items, but seriously guys, have some tact and take a class in public speaking. There are ways to get your point across without being rude. They both seemed almost irritated to have to show people around.On a positive note, Frank (I think that is his name) - tall man who volunteers on Saturdays was FABULOUS. Really very friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. He was a definite plus and helped to end the day on a high note.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlnRoundUS

50,Free Museum,"Off the beaten path, in the middle of nowhere, out of LA and up the 5 a few exits, this museum is worth the drive. On one side of the street is a museum that is only by tour and kids have to be at least 12 years of age. We were there with 9 year old twins, so we went to the other side of the street to the free self guided museum. It is wonderful. We played a game: you have just been awarded a prize, you can take home only one car, which one would it be. All 5 of us chose a different model, but we all agreed that the best in show goes to the car and camper combination! We got there at 11am and stayed until they opened the pullman train car at 12:30.Not very crowded and who can beat free, it is an incredible collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panama2000

50,Hidden Gem,"Way up in Sylmar, at the north end of the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area, is the Nethercutt museum. I went there with my wife and grandson - and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can't imagine what the current value is of the vehilces displayed - over 200 in the collection, if I remember correctly. Vehicle condition is excellent. Restoration and preservation clearly were in the mind of Mr. Nethercutt, who had a love of these vehicles, bought and restored them, and built the buildings that house the collection to be viewed by the public - with no admission charge!. Also in the collection are various hood ornaments, car accessories and specialized vehicles, including at last one fire engine. I think the collection spans theyears from about 1900 to perhaps the 1960's. Other parts of the collection include musical devices and a coal-fired locomotive with a luxury passenger car. As I mentioned, all is free, but the musical devices and some vehicles are open by tour arrangements only on certain days of the week. Our grandson was amazed at the variety of vehicles and really enjoyed visiting the museum. These vehicles' fuel efficiencies may only have been a few miles per gallon. And many were available only to rich people at the time they were sold. Still, this is a worthwhile place to visit to see the beautiy and elevance of a bygone ere - on wheels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happy2travelnow

50,Best secret in LA,"I could write a 20 page review of this place and it would do it no justice. They have one of the most amazing car collections I have ever seen, some amazing art, but the coup de grâce is the music. The piano that plays rhapsody in blue from when Gershwin sat down on that very piano and made the recording, to the massive and breathtaking music boxes to the 3rd largest organ in the world.

50,Superlative auto collection! Must See!,"My daughter knows I love to photograph and view antique and muscle cars. She took me to this museum during a recent visit. The Nethercutt Museum was one of the best I have ever been too. Amazing collection of automobiles, especially from the beginning in the early nineteen hundreds up to just after WWII. Love all the old Packards, Pierce Arrows, Rolls Royces, with the great hood ornaments and details. Even better, this museum was free. That is right folks, free! If you plan to view, set aside a few hours. It is well worth your time. Open Tuesday - Saturday. If plan on seeing the Nethercutt Collection, make a reservation! Located across the street from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shuttrrbug

50,Go Car and Gadget Crazy,"We visited the Nethercutt several weeks ago when my daughter and a classmate from Edmonton were in town. This was a first visit for us, despite living in LA since the 70's. What a treat! They have a fantastic car collection ranging from a classic Talbot in the Museum to a beautiful grey beast of a Dusenberg in the Collection. Many of the cars in the Collection are ribbon winners from the Concours in Pebble Beach. This is strictly a ""no touch"" collection, so no sitting behind the wheel (too bad!). The Collection is separate from the Museum. The Collection requires a reservation, the Museum does not. The Museum is open Tuesday - Saturday. The Collection Thursday - Saturday only. the Collection also has a floor devoted to various mechanical music devices including an extended piano (97 keys) and a Wurlitzer with 6,000 +/- pipes. One of the treats is getting to listen to the various devices playing music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias

50,Beautiful Automobiles,"I have never seen so many beautiful cars in my life. As someone said in a earlier review I would pay admission. We did not have to time to take the guided tour, so I bought the DVD so I could enjoy it again and again. Make sure you have good directions because it is in an area that you would not expect it.Be sure take the tour, you will not believe the quality of the cars. We will definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinm493
50,one of my absolute favorite museums anywhere,"this place is just fantastic - but make sure to book the tour, because that's the best part of all by far. The cars are amazing, the staff really know how to do a tour (haven't had a bad one yet) and for me the ultimate is always the mechanical and functional musical instrument collection on the top floor which is not something you'd ever expect to see. The cars are beautiful, and they're only allowed to be on display if they're ready to drive away - literally. The batteries are charged, and all these beauties are 100% ready to go. The most amazing one to me is probably the late 1800s electric car - this really looks like a horseless carriage - but their collection really is stunning. It's in a bit of an odd place, and not that easy to get to if you don't have your own transport, but make the effort: it's really, really worthwhile.One of the things that I find very noteworthy - we are in the museum industry, and so visit quite a lot of museums and theme parks. I'd say that in terms of people management (this is talking about the guided tour), this is one of the best places I've come across. These folks have people management down to a fine art, most impressive. I've sent quite a few people there just to experience that part of it, and again, in that respect it probably is the very best example I've come across.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itstheflyingdutchman
50,We'd have even paid for this!,"The mass of cars in the main building is the best part. Our group of 24 RVers were part of the 100 or so who also attended on of the across-the-street tours. Two hours was way too long, with too much time between narrator's comments and moving us on to the next area. EVERTONE was tired and sitting down before she called for us to do so at the end, for a musical treat. The tour includes lots of musical ""boxes"" etc. but took too long. Just visit the cars in the main hall across from Merle Norman HQ.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tucsonk8

This is one museum not to miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanJG
50,Must See,"This is such an unexpected attraction and not well known by others than the local residence. The outside building is hardly representative of what you find once you enter. Such surprises, such a classic autos in pristine condition. A selection of mechanical musical instruments, some one of a kind and a huge if not one of the largest organs. When it’s played the background creates a light show. Much more to see. It’s free, but some events require (free) tickets which can be obtain by calling them directly. It’s well worth the try. Wonderful concerts and silent movies with live organ accompanying music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gadabout2015

It's a museum that's FREE, showcasing some 200 of the most beautiful classic cars you will ever see and all sorts of interesting music makers from yesteryear. You need an appointment for the tour that takes you across the street to the music making annex but it is well worth it. They also do concerts and present silent films over there so go to their webiite to check out upcoming events. Tour takes two hours.

The full tours are given Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Also, children under age 10 are not permitted on the guided tour.If you can't make a reservation you can still visit the car museum and see a restored steam engine train, open Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. For this visit children under age 12 must be accompanied by an adult.If you are big on Christmas music don't miss the annual concerts, also free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239ernies
50,Cool,"If you like restored cars, this is the place for you. Free admission, and a building full of shiny restored vehicles, some of which I had never heard of before.

Pretty easy to get to from LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janebE3853JD
10,OUTDATED WEBSITE!!! CALL FIRST FOR OPENING HOURS AND DAYS!,"This Museum is closed Mondays but Nethercutt/website don't take the trouble to advise tourists that their museums closes the day after public holidays - presumably some antiquated ideology that predates the car collection. Somebody needs their job role reviewed.Fellow enthusiasts with us had travelled 1,000 miles compared to our 6,000 as part of the usual travel itinerary. Disappointment ran high as this was a supposed highlight of a long and detailed trip.Today's travellers rely on websites for good info, accurate opening hours and good reviews.Please bring yourselves up to date Nethercutt and post a comment if you care.We appreciate that your wonderful museum is free but it need to be open outside of factory hours to be appreciated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Knowstravelstuff

The 100+ antique and classic cars on display are just priceless. Its a true step back into time when cars were pieces of art. The museum itself is very clean, the vehicles are in perfect or near perfect condition. The staff is very friendly. I can't believe you can visit this place for free. Also, while there are other visitors, it wasn't crowded at all, giving you plenty of time to soak in the experience. Plan for at least 2 hours, but 3 if you really want to examine each vehicle closely.

50,"Wonderful Museum for enthusiast of Autos, Functional Art and Musical Instruments","I have visited this facility twice and was quite delighted each time. The first time we had a group tour that included the multi-story functional art building that includes a twenties auto showroom on the first floor ringed by a balcony of hood ornament displays and other interesting functional art pieces. Reservations are necessary for touring this building and guided group tours are the only way to tour it. A musical instrument museum is located on the top floor. The next time we did not reserve a tour but visited only the one floor museum across the street that houses a changing display of wonderful antique autos as well as a steam locomotive connected to beautiful custom passenger cars owned by a very rich person in the nineteenth century. It is outfitted as a house on wheels and everyone can walk through it. Inside the museum there is also a nineteen thirties travel trailer connected to a Pierce Arrow auto that you can also enter. There is no charge for either museum, all provided by the Nethercutt family who made their fortune manufacturing cosmetics and want to keep the past alive through this fine museum.

We toured the museum looking at every automobile. There were over 100 cars in the museum. The grand children were fascinated with the Bugatti cars. After two hours of touring inside, museum officials offered an outside tour featuring a locomotive and a restored car.Admission to the Nethercutt Collection was free and so was parking. I am sure not if they allowed photo taking. I did not ask.We all had a great afternoon and everyone in my family enjoyed the Nethercutt Collection.

50,"Top quality, totally free attraction - but not for kids.","IIt seems that this attraction is surprisingly not very well known, even to many Angelinos. However, it thoroughly deserves its high ratings here on Trip Advisor. It is not only completely free, but so is the adjacent parking, thus instantly elevating it to the top of the value for money charts!Trip Advisor’s “Recommended length of visit” is 2-3 hours. That’s really not enough, unless you omit either the main car exhibition on one side of Bledsoe St or the guided tour of “The Collection” across the other side of the street. Missing either of these would be a real shame, unless you have visited this attraction before. I recommend covering it all in one visit and I suggest a realistic minimum of three hours, much more likely to be four, if you take in all that is on offer. The guided (and very entertaining) tour of “The Collection” alone lasts two hours, plus a little time before and after the actual guided period. Add at least a solid hour for the main car section (some people will spend 2-4 hours in there!) and another good twenty minutes to be guided around the magnificent Canadian Pacific locomotive and custom built Pullman Rail Car. You WILL want to take photographs!Photography is permitted throughout, but Video and FLASH photography are forbidden in “The Collection”. This is a little frustrating, but you must go along with the rules. Tempting to knock off one star for the restriction, but I absolutely won’t because it remains a very interesting and highly enjoyable visit. I will definitely return when the opportunity arises.PS With respect, this attraction is not aimed at small children and does not cater for them in any way. So please don't drag toddlers along and then complain! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John-Tropi

The front desk provided all sorts of background information, the warehouse was completely carpeted and the cars were lined up with placards providing details about what was unique about this car. Each car was more beautiful than the next. A bonus was the rail car and engine out back. Beautifully restored and I could 'feel' what it was like to live in that car. The museum also had some music boxes that were in working order and fabulous. My only regret was that I did not have a ticket for the tour of the music and furniture museum across the street!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24QueenBee

However, the main building held plenty of classic cars, each restored to its fabulous glory days. Many are one of a kind; a priceless collection.Admission is free; plenty of free parking.

50,"I've lived in LA 25 years, how had I missed our #2 attraction?","I've known about the Nethercutt for years, but hesitated to go. I'm not really a car enthusiast, how long could I possibly be interested? Happily my daughters had no such qualms and took me there for my birthday this year. The cars were mesmerizing and the two guides (one for the cars and one for the amazing antique musical instruments) could each do their one person show and do very well on their own. Although there is a self guided tour, I heartily recommend the free tour detailing not only the cars, but the history of the Nethercutt as well as Merle Norman, the benefactor of the whole collection.We were very happy just looking at the cars, but when we were shown up the winding staircase into the gigantic room filled with dazzling musical instruments and one of the largest pipe organs in the world, we didn't know where to look first. That part of the tour was topped off by a demonstration of the pipe organ plus an amazing concert featuring Phantom of the Opera and the theme from The Raiders of the Lost Ark. As much as I loved all parts of that tour, I think getting to sitting on the floor (there were couches, by the way) and listening to that organ was the capper. They have free concerts several times a year + some that feature silent movies. A wonderful attraction for tourists and for locals. It's a bit of a hike up the 405, but very worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latrvlr

50,Our favorite car museum yet!!,"My husband is a major classic car geek and we have been in several car museums around the country. We planned a road trip to Napa that began with Barrett Jackson in Vegas and then we headed over to LA to visit the museums there. The Nethercutt was really amazing and we both loved it! If you possibly can, you should definitely do the tour across the street. It was very well done and you get to see a large number of cars you would miss otherwise, not to mention all the musical devices there. The cars are displayed in the beautiful room you will see in some of the pictures below, which is made to resemble what auto showrooms used to look like. I wish when we entered that room that we had been a little better at managing our time. The guide warned us that we would only be in there about 30 minutes (I think that's right...), but it is easy to get so distracted. But we will be back, I'm sure and I will catch the cars I missed the first time. The rest of the museum is also great if you don't have time for the tour. The one thing we missed and have since read about was the Pullman train car. That was open for only a short time around 1 PM and we were so hungry that we ran out to find a bite to eat before returning for the afternoon. Next time we go, I will take some snacks or buy a sandwich to eat out in the car , as the food options nearby are limited.Really an amazing museum and collection- and it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGH
50,A Car or History Lovers Way to Spend A Day In LA: Nethercutt Museum & Collection,"If you love antique cars or just love history and have an interest in music you will love the Nethercutt Museum & Collection. I expected to be there a couple hours and it turned into 5. Note: The ""Nethercutt Museum"" is a self guided tour, free and open to the public and houses 130 or so antique cars. The ""Nethercutt Collection"" is housed in a building across the street from the museum. It has a free two hour guided tour however you will need to make a reservation prior to your arrival. It consist of 20 - 30 cars and a music instrument collection. I was not aware of this however they slipped my group in at the last minute. ""The Collection"" has the most interesting cars, a musical instrument collection, auto related antiques and miscellaneous items. The highlight of ""The Collection"" tour was the music provided at the end of the tour on a 1918 Wurlitzer Theatre Concert Pipe Organ. There is a Pullman car with locomotive behind the museum and is open to walk through however unfortunately it is closed during bad weather and it was raining the day we went. No flash photography is allowed and no video or audio recording of music is allowed. It is definitely a place to visit if you have the time. I plan go go back one day to see the Pullman Car and Locomotive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SportLube

I particularly liked the style of the American 1940's autos. Especially the Cadillac models. I also like what I called Rolls Royce alley. Each of the examples represent true automobile royaltie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DAV647
50,Cars,This is a great museum. It's staggering the cars that are here and is a must for car buffs. They have a second museum across the street that's worth a visit also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReverendIke
40,Families don't get the full experience.,"This is a fabulous museum, the display of cars is superlative and we hope to see the train and the Pullman car another day - it was raining on our visit so this part was closed. However the Collection is housed in another building and sounds just fabulous. You join a twice daily tour to see the Grand salon, more cars, antiques, musical instruments and hear the organ. However children under 10 are not permitted. This is a great shame and seems a high age barrier. Our 6 year old grandson is used to going to art galleries and museums and would have loved this. What a shame families cannot enjoy the full experience of this wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodie16
50,One of a Kind vintage Automobiles and Music machines,This has got to be one of the finest collections of one of a kind vehicles and musical machines that have been restored and are in top operating condition. All the cars can be driven at all times. The highlight was the music provided at the end of the tour on a 1918 Wurlitzer Theatre Concert Pipe Organ. There is no charge for seeing any of the vehicles. I would suggest calling ahead to ensure the tour is not full. The collection is only accessible during the tour but the museum across the street is self guided. There is a Pullman car with engine behind the museum and is open to walk through at 12:30 and 3:30. No flash photography is allowed and no video or audio recording of music is allowed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RWS92443
40,Amazingly restored cars!,"My husband and I decided to visit this museum at the last minute and found it to be a very interesting experience. I made an online reservation very early on the morning I wished to go and was able to join the 10 am tour as we are local to the area. We were definitely on the younger side of this group, and that's not saying much. We did enjoy the tour, but just don't expect to rush through, it's at the pace the docent decides upon. Our tour guide did a great job, and the place is gorgeous, but the pace is slow. The ""collection"" tour is 2 hours, which is more than enough time.There is a museum across the street with the ""overflow"" cars that don't fit in the ""collection"" building. The self guided tour at this museum can easily be accomplished in a half hour. We did wait to see the train that is behind the museum building, which is interesting, but I wouldn't wait around if it isn't convenient.I didn't know that the Nethercutt family was into music as well as cars, but we loved seeing the Orchestrions, and more importantly we loved that we had the chance to hear them play.That was worth the trip on its own. The cars are truly amazing, as they are in mint condition and absolutely flawless, ( I'm not especially into cars) but the musical aspect is great as well.I enjoyed this tour very much. I found the cars to be incredibly beautiful. I was amazed that someone had spent so much time and money on preserving cars. I loved the old orechestions that played music from a time long past. All in all, if your not in a rush, this was a really nice way to spend 2 or 3 hours, that gave you a glimpse into the past and preserved a part of automotive history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kapro
50,Well worth the visit,"My opinion is a bit prejudiced. J.B. Nethercutt personally gave me a tour the first week San Sylmar opened and many of my friends have or are still working there. Needless to say I believe that anyone even slightly interested in automobiles or music should take the time to make a reservation. If that doesn't work, you can still visit a world-class museum that was constructed across the street. Even that is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldcartours
50,Superb collection for free!!!,"This museum has wonderful collection of old cars. Restoration quality is superb. They also claim that this is only museum that has full Rolls-Royse phantom collection.Every car has characteristics shown along with the prise, so it could be nice learning experience for car enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardFua
50,Best museum I have been to and I have seen a lot !,"What a place and the best bit is the Collection which is a must and well worth making the appointment to see , its difficult to imagine how all this was not only collected but preserved and renovated to the standard they exhibit.The staff are so informative and helpful and the whole experience is very uplifting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brian_purtle
50,Gorgeous Collection,"This museum is absolutely gorgeous and worth a look. I visited in the weekend and was lucky to see everything this museum had to offer. It has stunning cars, a train in the back, and a nice little theater with A/C ! We went on a very hot day but we were cool almost all day there. We also got the tour they offer. You have to call ahead and reserve a spot. I called that same day in the morning and was able to get us in. The hidden collection and ball room setting is amazing, it was a jaw dropper for us. I also enjoyed the music room , their orchestras were really fun to see. Overall if you haven't yet seen this place I would highly recommend. Plus it is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3864ZVlizc
50,Amazing!!,"If you want to find a real treasure trove, them you have to visit this museum. The collection of antique and exotic cars is fabulous!! They also have an extensive collection of organs and other music players along woth many amy other collectibles... Great for couples, families, groups!! A MUST see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashell4u
50,Amazing automobile collection,"If you like old cars, don't miss this museum. It is a little ways out but very near the freeway exit.It is best to make a reservation in order to join the guided tour, very worth it.There is plenty of parking and the entrance is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514bernadettet
40,Unique and Impressive Collection,"We visited the Nethercutt for one of their very rare movie/music events and boy am I glad we did. I would have NEVER known that this place existed, despite having actually LIVED in Sylmar for about a year!! It's way more than just classic cars, although those are really cool. They also have lots of figurines, artworks, statues, and the best part...a hugemongeous pipe organ, with pipes running through the entire room where they show the silent movies. This was a one of a kind experience, and one of my first dates with my (now) boyfriend of 3 years, and I credit this place with helping me see what an adventurous spirit he has. Just very unique and cool, nothing like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kungfoofighter82
30,"Very interesting & beautiful cars, but lots of similar ones",We really enjoyed walking through the exhibit. There were some very interesting cars - didn't bother walking through all of them because it seemed to repeat after a while. My boyfriend wished there were more cars from the 60sish. Make sure to go on a thurs-Sat so they're doing tours. If you're around the area this is definitely worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caitm77
50,This is a MUST SEE,The cars and the artifacts are Amazing. Make sure you call ahead of time and book a tour. They have two a day. You will get much more information and can see the entire museum. Do not miss this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndiMom
40,Early automobile buffs and others interested in industrial design must see,"If you are interested in early automobiles -- especially design and trim, the Nethercutt Museum should not be missed.I took two engineers who work for General Motors in Brazil. They thought it was FANTASTIC!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConduitConsulting
50,Fantastic collection.,This auto collection is one of the best I've seen and it's free entry. Plenty of parking.The cars are arranged chronologically so you can walk the aisles and track the design and technology changes.You'll need to book for a guided tour of the 4 level Museum across the road but it's also free.Always make a point of coming here when in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyPhil21C
50,Trip Back in Time!,"If you have any interest in automobiles, this is an amazing venue. Admission is free, but I'd gladly pay - what a gift this family has given the public! The self-guided tour is an awesome opportunity to see rare cars, including the car that was in the original The Great Gatsby.Although I didn't have a huge interest in the music it was interesting to see a few pieces from that era.Entrance to the pullman/locomotive is also free. However you can only access it twice per day, so you might want to time your visit around that.Unfortunately my visit was short and I wasn't able to visit on the days the Nethercutt Collection is open, but my understanding is this is well worth the time. This section is by reservation only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAnotherJourney
50,Such an enjoyable place to visit!,"Gorgeous Classic Cars, beautiful and rare musical instruments, a tour of an old passenger train. Fun day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingforFun3333
50,Hidden gem,"Make reservations to be able to see both sides of this amazing antique car museum. Admission & parking are free. Second floor car showroom looks like something out of a palace. It is a reproduction of a car dealership. Large collection of organs, stay for the demonstration to see how they accompanied the silent movies. Across the street is another bldg filled with antique cars & outside is a private railroad car thT was used for travel. You don't need to be a car enthusiast to enjoy this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncjc2013
50,must see!,"I was simply stunned by the collection.It's huge, really well maintained and nicely presented.Sadly the 2nd room, with even more cars is only open at very specific times. But even without it, I was amazed and it was very well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/umrath
50,What a Great Experience,"This is a little known, must see. Antique cars, completely restored to showroom quality, organs of all sizes and old railroad cars. A little out of the way but worth the drive and time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbH8204CN
40,well maintained!,"A fabulous collection of vintage cars from 1910s to 1930s. This is not just about cars, this museum has also the finest collection of mechanical musical instrument which is one of the best in the world. And the best thing about visiting this place is that it’s FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wenqilim13
50,Wonderful,"This is a small museum but they have lots of classic cars. Also, I was amazed that they actually have the car from ""The Great Gatsby"" movie in this museum. I believe they have more to show if you take the guided tour. It's actually free admission. I enjoyed it especially my husband.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chessiekiethp
50,Took my 94 year old father,"I thought my father might enjoy the museum and he did, but I enjoyed it as much or more. It is an amazing collection and would love to share the experience with any of my friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CorineAmato
50,Off the road,"This is a real find in the north valley. A fabulous collection of classic cars, some displayed in a setting meant to resemble a car dealership from the 20s or 30s. There's also an old railroad car beautifully adorned and fit for a robber baron before TR started busting up the trusts. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffears
50,Excellent collection in excellent condition!,"All of the cars are in prestine condition, and I loved that they tell you who the owners have been (that is the most fascinating part). I went to do some research for a book, and needed to see some of the cars I would be writing about up close. I was so grateful that this was only a 15 minute drive and the museum is free (I've paid a good deal to get into car exhibits at museums before, and the cars weren't even this well maintained.) The staff is friendly, but not intrusive. There is also a library in the museum, I'm assuming car literature.If you want to see inside the train, be sure to get the times right. They only show the inside twice daily for 15 minutes and I believe the times are 12:45 and 3:45. There is also a museum across the street with more of the Nethercutt's personal collection of musical instruments and cars, but they only show it Thursday-Saturday by two hour guided tour which you must make reservations for. I would consider coming back for this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
30,NOT kid or baby friendly.,"The car collection was fun and wonderful specimens.I found the staff kurt and unfriendly, unlike the very attentive and friendly staff at our visit to Getty Villa the day before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaandRick
50,WOW!! (See this!),"OK, I'm a car nut, but even so... This place has a truly first class collection, heavily weighted toward Full Classics (you won't see Tri-Five Chevys here!), impeccably restored (Pebble Beach quality). Displayed in the music hall portion of museum such that you can get up close and personal, they open up a couple of the cars for interior examination, including the 20 Grand. Be on time!! You will not get to see the cars in the garage again on the way down. Also, take the earlier tour so you have enough time on the back end. Indeed my only criticism is that a serious car lover would spend longer than allotted in the car rooms - Rhapsody in Blue goes far too fast - as a musical timekeeper. The musical instrument collection is fascinating too, and that was just a nice bonus, as was the restored parlor car out back. In the main building cars are not as accessible, but contain a full sampling of V12s, and an SSJ (Coop's). Really is smashing. And FREE. My goodness. I actually bought the book at this one :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,A Little Known Gem,"I have seen many car museums, but this is one of the best. Not only cars but much more. J.B. Nethercutt, founder of Merrell Norman Cosmetics loved ""Functional Art"". He considered cars, musical watches, Player Instruments, Hood Ornaments and other items as works of art with a function to them. He has some historic vehicles like cars that belonged to Rudolph Valentino and Fatty Arbuckle. Check out their website http://www.nethercuttcollection.org/ before going and ake a reservation for the tour. It is worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csarchibald
50,This is a must,"We went on the free tour given by the staff and it was wonderful. Two and half hours and then we toured the rest of the collection. It was fantastic!! This is a must for anyone, even those who aren't into cars. The musical collection was fascinating as well. I can't believe the whole thing is free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raegan1313
50,World class auto collection,"Who would have thought! An amazing car museum and music box collection in an unlikely place. Most families would have built their weekend retreat in a scenic location. But, not the Nethercutt's. They call it San Sylmar, a great comparison to Hearst Castle in San Simeon on the Big Sur coast.Once you are guided into the museum, think Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as a ticket has to be reserved in advance, or you will be denied entry. It's a wowser experience.There is a large car museum that can be visited without reservations.Worth any effort to get into the main museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Unbelievable!,Nothing I can say will prepare you for this place. A Trust ensures this special place remains free to visit. Visit the website and JUST GO!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/979gordonw
40,Auto Collectibles Galore,This is basically a museum showcasing vintage cars by the Nethercutt family ! The collection is vast and I learned a thing or two which car brands were already exiting back in the day. We went to the one open to the public everyday but if you wanted to get into the major museum you need to reserve as they issue tickets only to those who request it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dagkim
50,Out of the Ordinary,Went here with my nephew (27 yrs old) who loves cars. This was an unexpected jewel! The main car museum has an extensive collection of antique cars; trucks and even a railroad car. This part of the museum you do not need reservations for but you have to make reservations for the other museum across the street which is a must see (it is free). You start out in the basement and see more unique antique cars...just amazing; then you go upstairs (they do have an elevator if you need it) and you go into a car showroom as it was set up back in the 1920's/30's it is magnificent!! You then go up another set of stairs and go see several antique music boxes; accessories used in the cars such as the hood ornaments (remember those??); custom vanity sets that were part of the car and mini bars....then you go upstairs and you are in a music room that is filled with old time mechanical musical instruments and organs...it is a fantastic experience. My nephew loved it and I had a wonderful time. They give you a little concert on the organ which is great. This is truly a MUST SEE!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fechef
50,Wow!,"If you love cars, you will be blown away. I have been to many auto museums and nothing comes close to this one. We didn't even go to the second museum across the street, or see the train car out back. This will exceed your expectations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackF577

50,Not just cars!,"The cars here look like showroom new; but, they are all drivers and are taken out for many events. But wait until you see and hear the pipe organ! Usually one of the curators will go to the keyboard and give a mini-concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466harryh
50,Mind Blowing Experience,"The last change of summer I can take my son go out with me, I chose Nethercutt Museum. Once I stepped inside, I knew I found the treasure island. After 5 years car sales experience, I knew so little about car after today. What a glory history in the past about cars, I only regret that I came this late. Love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cchangle
50,Fantastic Visit,"This place was truly amazing. Literally hundreds of restored vintage cars, all gleaming like they had just rolled off the production line. I'm not a real car buff but I loved the fact that it is basically one massive room with the cars in chevron rows - stretching out for yards and yards.The 1936 Dussenberg that featured in the first 'Gatsby' movie was a particular favourite, and the train out back with the pullman coach is not to be missed. We expected to visit for an hour or so and ended up spending 4 hours here!Only slight drawback is there is no coffee shop on the premises - we could have been doing with sustenance while we were there. Refreshingly though, neither is there the usual gift-shop either!The Nethercutt Collection, across the road, requires advanced booking and has very limited opening hours. We weren't able to visit it, but that's fine: it gives us the perfect excuse to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piglit36
50,Great collection,Great collection of cars. For car people and even non car people good place to see some amazing vehicles. Be sure to check out the train there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishMT
50,Fabulous!,I loved this museum! My husband and I have been to a majority of museums in the LA area and this is my favorite by far. Much better than the Petersen museum of cars. We did the collection 2 hour tour and spent 2 hours across the street at the other part of the museum and I can't wait to go back again. I was really more interested in looking at the cars versus the musical instruments but I have to say I really enjoyed the instruments. Learned so much about the Wurlitzer and it's use during the silent movie era. The collection tour was great because they opened the doors of most cars so you could get a really good look. Can't wait to take family and friends there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j0niq
50,Fabo collection of autos and related items,"We loved our tour through the museum's many displays. Besides the autos we were treated to some unique displays--like hood ornaments of every description. The upstairs music room is very special and something to see. A real peek into the lives of our ancestors. Across the street from the 'old' museum is another collection and one not requiring reservations. These cars are equally wonderful and often there is a special exhibit. One of my children loved the restored travel trailer. A peek out the back door finds a restored train, another not to be missed, unique look at the way we traveled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateS7
50,"Wow, Wow, Wow!","What an incredibly pleasant surprise in a very unexpected location! If you want to see some extraordinary beautiful cars from a bygone era, DO NOT MISS the Nethercutt Museum.

50,In a Class by Itself,"Not quite what I expected. Only better. The cars are pristine, better than showroom. Just unreal. The collection had cars I was unfamiliar with. The place is spotless, even carpeted. Very impressive.Even if you're not a big fan of these vintage autos you will be by the time you leave. Great displays. I did not have the chance to make the other locations, but I wish I did. Take the time and make a reservation for the entire museum, then you won't be disappointed. It is top notch, well worth it. And it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
50,A Hidden Gem,"I had absolutely no idea this place existed. If you are a car person or even someone who loves 'Modern Marvels' then this is a 'must see'.

Sign up for the tour of the other building and get to see more wonderful antique cars. Make sure you either call early to sign up as the tours fill up fast. The building which houses the other portion of the collection is fascinating in and of itself. The other collections of orchestrations, music boxes, and phonographs are interesting as well.

50,"If you like cars or music, this is a hidden treasure","This is one of those places that slips under the radar even when you live relatively nearby for a long time. The cars here are amazing, but I was most impressed by the collection of one-of-a-kind musical instruments and orchestrions. If you don't know what those are, you should if you have any interest in music history. These are fascinating, as is the Wurlitzer pipe organ. All are working instruments and hearing them played was awesome. They also play old phonographs, disc and cylinder players and a host of other musical devices.The guides/curators are excellent- both engaging and informative. It did take a couple of weeks for me to book a spot, so you might want to book early if you want the guided tour, though you can visit part of the museum without guides.The most amazing part about this is the cost. It's free. Yep. Free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moretoons
50,A Must Stop if you like Old Cars (pre WWII),"There are two parts to see the museum & collection. Both are free, but the ""collection"" is seen only by tour, which typically only takes place once a week on Saturday.The museum, on one side of the street in an industrial area near San Fernando, has a large collection of restored (beautifully, perfectly restored). There are so many cars here, it is overwhelming. There are makes I've never heard of on display (such the Diana model from Moon).The museum is worth seeing on its own if you like old cars, but you don't want to miss the collection so make a reservation in advance and plan your trip around it. It will take 2 to 3 hours. You'll see more cars, some of the best of the collection, but you'll see other parts of the collection. Most importantly, not only see but also hear.

40,"The Nethercutt Museum, Not Just for Guys","I’ve lived in the Los Angeles area all of my life, and I can’t believe I’ve never been to the Nethercutt Museum until now. My husband and I both love old cars, and the Nethercutt collection is not only stellar, it’s FREE.I made a reservation for six people to take the tour of the “Collection”, which is housed in a four story building designed to look like an automotive grand salon of the 1920's and 1930's, with marble columns, crystal chandeliers, and painted ceilings. I won’t list all of the cars in there, but we did see Duesenbergs (my favorites), Cadillacs, Isotta-Fraschini, Delahaye, Minvera, Renault, Maybach, Packards and a plethora of others.Also housed in this building is a collection of mechanical musical instruments, including Reproducing Pianos, Nickelodeons, Music Boxes, and a Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ. They even demonstrated some of the big Nickelodeons and pianos, and there was a mini-concert on the Wurlitzer Pipe Organ, which was utterly amazing.Tours are available on: Thursday, Friday & Saturday at 10:00am or 1:30pm. Reservations for the tour are required.After the tour, which takes about two hours, we went across the street to the Museum, which houses over 100 cars from the late 1800’s to the 1970’s. Again my favorite was a Duessenberg. Built in 1933, the “Twenty Grand,” was a metallic seafoam green color with all kinds of chrome and white walled, spoked wheels. Okay, I may not have the correct terminology down because I’m not really a “car” person. When I look at these old cars, I’m looking at works of art, but all the “car” people that were with me were thoroughly impressed by this collection as well.The Museum is open Tuesday – Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.There is also a locomotive and private rail car you can walk through out back, which is pretty cool. It only takes about 15 minutes to walk through, but if you get there right at opening, it takes longer because someone gives you a little history lesson about the restoration.The locomotive is open Tuesday – Saturday, at 12:30 p.m. and at 3:45 p.m. If it’s raining, it doesn’t happen.Note: You don't have to take the tour to get into the Museum, so if you don't have the two hours to spare for the tour, just go see the cars in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calsie-CA
50,Shock and Awe,"If you even think you might like a car museum, you have to visit this place. It's free and you should definitely make time for the extra guided tour. You need to make a free reservation for that, check out the web site for details and contact info. This is not our (my wife and I) typical cup of tea but we had a great time and have encouraged family and friends to check it out. You should too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/central_coast_lover
50,Best museum I've been to.,Where to start. This is part of the Merle Norman cosmetics estate and a diamond type of find. We had a guided tour for part of the stay and the host and hostess were very knowledgeable and entertaining. The museum is on both sides of the street. On one side there are hundreds of wonderful antique automobiles (and train engine and private pullman car). On the other side of the street are several unique cars plus old time Nickelodeons and Orchestrions like used to be found in gambling parlors and silent movie studios. Everything works and is laid out for easy viewing. We also visited the Petersen Auto Museum in LA and to me there isn't any comparison. The Nethercutt visit was free and was much more enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vicksburger
50,A must see,"For any car enthusiast. Free admission makes it all the more enticing. Spectacular collection. Make a reservation and take the tour. You will be glad you did. The music room is incredible. Even if you don't care for cars much, the performance in the music room is worth taking the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7320UP
50,Calling all classic car fans,While the museum tour requires a reservation there is an adjacent showroom filled with restored cars. The location of the museum requires a drive into the San Fernando Valley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
40,Nothing About Makeup Here,"The Nethercutt Museum was founded by Merle Norman as a display for his many car collections. This is a free museum. That's right FREE! Reservations are needed for the tour if you want to see the priceless car collection. It also includes a music room that holds one of the largest Nicklelodeon machines ever made. They even hold movie showings on occasions there. They also have an old Parlor train in the back that you can walk through. The only draw back is there is no dining area to eat in the museum. Not even a snack shop. Otherwise, it is a pleasant and relaxing couple of hours to spend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaBear63
50,Fantastic!,"What a great time we had touring this museum. The main attraction is the priceless collection of over 250 automobiles, all restored to mint condition, with many award winners from the top auto shows in the country. Really breathtaking in their beauty, they refer to them as functional art. A must for auto aficionados, they can be appreciated by anyone who loves beautiful objects. The tour of the music boxes and orchestrations was equally enjoyable, topped off by the experience of being inside the 10,000 square foot pipe organ on the 4th floor while it played a collection of favorites. A fabulous experience, what a contribution the Nethercutts have made to the public, and it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbyrnes3
50,Collections of Everything,"The tour of the music boxes is excellent. If you are into old cars, they sure have then as well. They also collected dolls, ceramics, coins, and more.

The grand salon includes musical instruments, clocks, watches, furniture, and auto accessories as well as the special auto collection. Fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgminnesota
50,Be a car buff for a day,"The main museum is well worth the drive out of LA, but the second museum accessible only by guided tour (register on-line, only Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays) is the real treasure house. My spouse is indifferent to vehicles, but the main museum caught her attention because of the amazing craftsmanship that was lavished on the old cars, first when they were manufactured and then when the Nethercutt museum staff refurbished the vehicles. The placards by each vehicle were inclusive and informative. The second museum housed the very best and most exotic vehicles as well as a large collection of working 'music machines', which were played in rotation for about an hour. These devices were like a player piano on steroids, having drums, horns, flutes, and other musical devices squeezed into a wooden case and operated by and electric motor pumping air. The museum staff were fun and informative. Please note that the second museum does not allow flash photography, so make sure your picture taking device can work in low light.And by the way, it's ALL FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldpo
50,This is a must see in Sylmar,I have been to this car museum 2 times and will go again and again. The tours are free and all you must do is make a reservation.

There is so much to see and learn about so a person should put aside at least 2-3 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boneytd
50,A Must!,"The layout, the tour guide, the items on display, the entire package! A must for car enthusiasts.

40,Car buff heaven!!,"What an interesting place and it's free! Beautiful vintage cars in mint condition. The museum is actually two buildings, across the street from each other. One of the museums holds cars and all kind of collections (rare dolls, expensive porcelain, player pianos, etc.) collected over the years by the Nethercutt Family. The other building houses cars only. You'll see the workers in their dusters cleaning and polishing each and every part of the car. The cars are stunning with their original colors. I'm not really a car buff, but for those who are into vintage cars, this is the place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1947annie

50,Hidden gem of a museum - awesome experience!,"We visited this museum on a rainy day in La, were looking for something to do indoors on a weekend trip here from the East Coast. This is a must-visit museum for anyone, and amazingly enough it is free (even parking). Collection of magnificently restored cars cannot be described - they must be seen in person to understand.The staff was super friendly and allowed us to join the tour of three story museum addition across the street (we did not even know about this tour beforehand - it was amazing). The building is beautifully decorated and no expense was spared in restoring 100's of cars, musical player pianos, large ORCHESTRIANS and assorted pipe organs. Kyle (the curator was friendly, funny and very knowledgeable, he loves what he does and has been working there 47 years ). The third floor 2 million dollar computerized player piano and Wurlitzer one of a kind organ that you get to hear playing is a once in a lifetime experience. Tours are given Thursday, Friday and Saturday - and should not be missed!!! This museum is a hidden gem, we could not have guessed how much we would have enjoyed it. Recommend it to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chanem
50,Unbelievable,"I heard about the museum from a friend of the family. The building housing the collection is immaculate and their is no charge for admission or parking. Once inside, I was amazed at all of the rare and beautifully restored cars. Some of the cars were from now extinct brands and maybe some of them were one of a kind as well. The Duesenberg Roadster on the mirrored turntablewas fantastic as you could see all the immaculate underpinnings as it revolved. Maybe the finest collection I have seen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/civicsi
10,Curator needs to be disabled aware,"My experiences at this museum has been quite good till today, I had a companion who had a folding walker attend the railway car located at the back of the museum. The Curator was accusing my disabled companion of trying to scratch the railway car before even going into the exhibit. He was condescending and did not even acknowledge her presence but spoke around her to me. We kept reassuring him that she had a folding rollator that would not hit any sides or wall. Finally we were allowed on the car and after he chastised us five times. We went through the exhibit without any incident and she did not hurt or scratch anything, but it was a horrible experience and my companion cried in the car as we headed home. I tried to speak to one of the co-curators Kyle but he said that the man was the head curator of the exhibit and could not do anything about it except to apologize for his inexcusable behavior. Please be aware that this Curator has no experience with ADA guidelines and needs sensitivity training.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3583WClisal
50,"Amazing, and Free!","Mind-blowing collection, beautifully presented, should be a $!5-20 admission charge, and it is free. When we were there, there were only 3 other people there. Don't get it.

We only was the one because the other required advance reservations to be placed on a tour. There are a old Rolls Royces and many Gatsby era vehicles here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Continent8
50,Serendipity!,"What a stroke of luck. Looking for something to do for a day in L.A; I happened across this museum. I had never heard of this place before.We rented a car and drove up from LAX, about a 45 minute drive. We were amazed by the car collection,and entry was free. What an amazing combination.There are 2 buildings- first building was the museum and housed a wonderful collection of cars, dating back to the 1890's. Most of the cars have been restored, often found as rusted-out heaps of junk and brought back to life by experts. It took about two hours to go through the museum. You will see a rare Tucker automobile there-remember the movie?Next, we were treated to the ""collection."" Entry to this building requires a reservation. You will get a guided tour through the building with often-humorous explanations. You will also learn about the building and some of the cars. The tour includes more rare cars (such as a surviving EV-1) and unusual and rare musical instruments, and a fantastic Edison Cylinder Player. Wow!! The tour takes about 2 hours, but we had to leave early to catch our flight out of LAX. Darn! I would have loved to stay.The Nethercutt...yes, free...Sylmar, California.

There are 2 buildings; one building requires an online reservation while the second building does not. Both buildings house vintage automobiles collected by the Nethercutt family who are the heirs of the Merle Norman Company. The building that requires a reservation houses early 20th century musical instruments and musical players which are located on the second floor.The vintage cars are located on the ground level. The tour is guided and takes about 2 hours. The second building houses vintage American and European cars, a classic railway coach, and will take an additional hour to view. Visiting the Nethercutt Museum is like stepping back in time. I am thankful for the opportunity to view such a magnificent private collection. Both buildings are completely free of charge and open to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolynrose

50,"Exquisite cars, seriously","Nethercutt is a man that can win the Pebble Beach concours d'elegance any time he chooses. It may be fair to say that that is the Oscar or indeed the Nobel Prize of car restoration. The cars in the museum reflect an extraordinary ability to capture beauty. The original Great Gatsby Duesenberg is magnificent as is every car in the museum. Then there is the Dubois bodied Bugatti and the other tiny Bugatti given by the founder of the Bank of America to his son. He must not have driven it much as it is in perfect unrestored condition.Across the street is the Nethercutt collection over four or so floors, cars, machines and interesting things - regrettably I didn't see it. But I will, and so will anyone I can convince to join me next time in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocRozey

The Collection is a must see as it contains some of the only ones in the world. If you want to view automobiles from the late 1800s to the mid 1940s restored to original condition be there at 9:00 AM when they open as it will take you all day to really view the automobiles.

50,Hidden Gem of a FABULOUS Los Angeles museum,"I am a long time resident of Los Angeles and was ever so surprised and enchanted by the breath-taking automotive museum the Nethercutt family has left in trust for the public to enjoy for FREE! I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in American ingenuity and tenacity - the collection had humble beginnings with an aunt who made cosmetics in her kitchen and a nephew who studied at Cal Tech that resulted in Merle Norman cosmetics. Nephew restores a car, earns an award and the rest is history. The Nethercutts are still winning prestigious awards for their meticulous restoration of automobiles. Across the street is the Nethercutt ""collection"" with more breathtaking cars, musical instruments and other collectables (to view these a reservation is required.) No children under 10 (too many tempting things for the young and impulsive to touch.) The staff are true professionals and provide lively interpretation. Planning is well worth your time to be inspired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81ucla
50,Route 66 trip,"At the end of 3 weeks on the road traveling Route 66, our group decided to visit some of the auto museums in the LA area. The Nethercutt is by far one of the most exquisite automotive museums I have ever seen. The quality of the cars in addition to the facilitiy is really first class. All the cars on display are housed in 2 buildings. One building is self guided and the other has a guide who helps explain the Nethercutt philosophy about the museum. All of this is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrbpm

50,Great museum!,"Whats not to like about this museum? It has mint classic cars 70-90 years old, a classic train with really nice interiors, its free, parking is easy, and its has a big open area that is much easier to explore than the typical maze-like museum. The bulk of the museum is the cars themselves, which are very interesting, and better than many museums that are too crowded with text, newspaper clippings, and small random artifacts. The location is also convenient if you are coming from the San Joaquin Valley as it is right off the grapevine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/671marcc
50,Do not Miss the Music Room,"Although I visited this Museum to see the cars, that was not the best part. The last top flooris the music room.

And the whole thing isFree.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amexwtc
50,A Wonderland of Cars and Musical Instruments,"We actually visited in March 2012 but TA doesn't let me select that date.An easy trip up from LA is this marvelous, FREE museum and collection where the founders and heirs to a cosmetics fortune have gathered hundreds of vintage automobiles and mechanical musical instruments, restored them to pristine working order, and invite the public to enjoy seeing and hearing them.The Museum houses hundreds of vintage cars - amazing in the detail of restoration and upkeep - all of which are in drivable condition. In fact, the owners of the Nethercutt use and show some of these cars.You can just walk in and tour the Museum.Across the street from the Museum is the Nethercutt Collection which houses, on multiple floors, the most spectacular of the cars as well as the collection of mechanical instruments. To view the Collection, you need to book a tour, which is free.Some of the vehicles are jaw-droppingly beautiful. Some are displayed on a floor set up in the manner of palatial car showrooms from long ago. The Collection also houses what I believe is the world's largest pipe organ which is demonstrated as part of the tour. The history of this type of instrument in silent films is also featured and discussed.Yes, its a bit off the beaten path of LA tourism, but anyone with an interest is vintage vehicles or instruments will be thrilled by the experience.The only - and in the scope of the whole, a minor one - disappointment was the rather programmatic information offered and general stand-offish attitude exhibited by the curator who was our tour guide.There's also a restored vintage train.Don't miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleP

50,Surprise! Surprise!,"We've lived in Southern California for over 25 years and never heard of this place until I saw it on Trip Advisor. We went last month and what a great surprise. I wouldn't say hubby and I are great car fans, but this isn't an ordinary collection of cars. These mostly antique cars are works of art, beautifully displayed in a grand showroom. There are also collections of dolls and miniature instruments and music boxes, jewelry, and a wonderful display of old musical instruments. You're even treated to music from the big Wurlitzer. We plan to go back for one of the concerts. The two hour guided tour went fast. There's a small elevator if four floors of stairs are too much. You'll need a reservation; just call, easy peasy. Free parking. Oh, and the museum is free too! Go!!! Thank you fellow Trip Advisor people for rating this and bringing it to my attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
40,Best Kept Secret in Sylmar,"I recently attended the Nethercutt museum with my family in July 2013, and we all loved looking at the classic cars.The Nethercutt museum is located in Sylmar a very short drive off the 5 freeway, exit Roxford St. The Nethercutt is actually two museums, there is the Nethercutt museum and the Nethercutt collection.The museum is free and is open Tuesday - Saturday 9am - 4:30pm. Parking is also free. The museum is filled with a fantastic collection of classic cars and some limited edition/special cars. No reservation is required and you are allowed to take photos. It is a self guided tour. They also have a classic restored train engine and Pullman rail car. You can see the exterior during normal museum hours. You can view the interior twice daily at 12:30pm and 3:45pm.The Nethercut Collection is located across the street from the museum, but a reservation is required. The guided tours are offered Thursday - Saturday, at 10am and 1:30pm. The tours of the collection are two hours long. The collection has more classic cars, classic furniture, and mechanical museum Instruments. Children must be 12 and over to attend the tour.The museum and collection are both definitely worth seeing, especially if you like classic and special cars. This place is truly a hidden gym. I have driven past this place so many times, and never even knew it was here, or I would have gone much sooner.I would highly recommend the museum and collection to all of my family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAFU23

The collection is eclectic and awe-inspiring - musical instruments, cars, art, furniture and much more. Kids under 10 are not allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMHLA
50,"Cars, cars, and more cars",What a treat it was to discover this museum! I have never seen so many wonderful cars gathered in one place except for the Petersen Museum. This museum was so manageable and was so neat because all the cars were all together. I especially enjoyed the display cases that have different parts of cars. This museum can be done in under an hour if you just want to breeze through But we took a little longer because we really wanted to appreciate all the vehicles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimimeme
50,Takes you back to a time when automobiles had style and character,"We were only in California for a limited time and definitely wanted to visit both the Nethercutt Museum and the Nethercutt Collection based on the excellent reviews. Be warned that their tours fill up fast so book early. Despite the fact that we couldn't take the guided tour of the collection, we decided to make the drive just to see the museum. Even if the limited ""tour"" days don't fit your itinerary or if they are full, the self-guided tour of the museum is an experience within itself - do it! You will feel like you've stepped backward in time as you stroll through aisles of beautiful and interesting vehicles. What a welcome respite from looking at cookie-cutter cars while sitting in Los Angeles traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MauiCoconut
50,Car Art Lovers Must See,"Yes, I say car art because these vehicles are works of art. There is another museum which is what I think this is supposed to be about but while my wife meandered it, I went to the auto musuem across the street.What a joy to stroll and admire each of the cars. An extensive collection worthy of the FREE admission. Yes, FREE. Limited hours so check their website before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveSantahohoho

50,Fantastic; Cars and Musical Instruments,A great free museum showcasing over a hundred beautifully restored cars that are all operational. Sign up in advance for the tour and you will travel through several floors of musical instruments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikerDave2
40,"If you like old cars and strange musical ""things"" this is the place for you!","This ""museum"" is first and foremost a tribute to the ego and money of the Nethercutt family and their car collecting and huge musical ""instrument"" (think room sized music boxes that play real instruments) collection. The cars are mostly very old (pre-1950) and purchased and then restored by Mr. Nethercutt and his minions. The absolutely best way to visit the museum is to sign up in advance for a free tour of the main building which houses the musical ""instruments"" and quite a few of cars. I took my family and my wife's 70+ year old Aunt and Uncle who really liked it. The tour presenters are well informed and patiently answer what I'm sure are the same questions over and over. My son and I actually liked the Nethercutt better than the Peterson Automotive museum but the cars shown are of the same ilk. The Nethercutt is in an odd location and not really near anything but it is well worth a visit if you're looking for something different if you're visiting or live in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark

The complimentary museum and tour were impressive, and educationally entertaining!Definitely make a reservation online for the complimentary 2 hour tour. Arrive 1 hour prior to the tour to peruse and enjoy the main vintage and classical car building.My favorites were the Bugatti, Mercedes, Rolls Royces in the main building.Across the street, is the reserved 2 hr private group tour, which is intimate, informative, and educational about Merle Norman's passion for the Pebble Beach Concours competitions.The tall building goes up several stories fir the tour. There is much dated traditional decor and antiques inside. The grand salon, corporate dining room, and Wurlitzer organ musical and sound room are truly unique. I loved the vintage Maybach and Deusenberg cars.We also enjoyed the end of the tour with the customized Pullman train walk through, with the history of how the Baldwin (owner of Baldwin Park, Santa Anita race track in Arcadia) family had purchased it.Fabulous find and I am definitely sharing it with others! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveSchnauzers

I can't recommend this enough, it is just FANtastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobMSU
50,A hidden treasure in Los Angeles-and it's free!,"I've been to the Nethercutt museum countless times, and bring all my out of town company to see these amazing treasures. Once the private collection of the owners of Merle Norman Cosmetics, the Nethercutts opened their collection to the world, with no charge to the public. I see that most of the reviews mention the classic cars, but if you're not into cars, this is still well worth a visit. The guided tour begins in the ""showroom"" of cars, all of which have been fully restored and are in perfect running order. You then go upstairs (there is also an elevator) to view magnificent furnishings, Faberge eggs, and various other collections. Everything is well laid out, and the guides love their subject, which makes it so much more enjoyable. The tour finishes on the top floor, where you are surrounded by in incredible array of ""player"" musical instruments, gathered from all over the world, as well as the Nethercutt's private dining room, where special events were held. Be sure to look at all the dining chairs, and ask about them. I won't spoil the surprise.There is also an additional building, which is not part of the tour, and which houses row upon row of antique and classic cars, some owned by long gone movie stars. There's even a vintage car with a matching motor home (more like a teardrop trailer), which must have cost a pretty penny when it was bought! You can go into the motor home and poke around the cupboards and see how ingeniously everything was put together.Once outside, there's the private Pullman car owned by one of Lucky Baldwin's (Baldwin Park, Baldwin Hills, Santa Anita racetrack, L.A. Arboretum) daughters. Also fully restored, it's one of only a handful of privately owned railroad cars known to still exist.The tour is free, but you must make a reservation. There is a dress code, because the Nethercutts believed that you should be appropriately dressed to view such beauty. So don't wear ratty jeans, cutoffs, flip flops, and the like.The annex building with all the additional cars, as well as Miss Baldwin's railcar, are not part of the tour, and are open whenever the museum is open, just to have a wander around. It's a lovely place to spend a morning or afternoon, and someplace you won't soon forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzicooks
50,This secret gem is worth checking out,"Do not hestitate to take the effort, make a reservation (a must!) and drive out of your way to this wonderful museum full of beautiful classic cars and self-playing old European musical instruments! Plus there are many other beautiful collections, such a Fabrege eggs and other collectibles to be seen. You don't need a reservation to see the car museum building, but you do fr the not-to-be-missed guided tour of the original house that holds all the other goodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DFR1

50,For all lovers of anything old and beautiful,"We discovered this place several years ago. Since then we have delighted our visitors with a trip there. This place is AWESOME. There are two buildings. One is open every day 9 am to 4:30pm. The other is by tour only Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. You must make reservations for the tour at (818) 364-6464. Well worth it (it's free) but do plan ahead. The building open every day has a fantastic collection of old cars. I say ""old"" but the incredible staff makes them look as new. The building you need reservations for houses not only another collection of history making automobiles displayed in a grand ballroom but an upstairs collection of musical instruments and the most awesome Mighty Wurlitzer (only with the tour). Outside the other building is a 1937 Canadian Pacific Royal Hudson locomotive and a 1912 Pullman private car. Everything restored to perfection. All autos are drivable and they do often. Even the tires and many car parts have been re-manufactured for these cars.Plan a few hours for this. You will be glad you did. This is a ""REAL"" gift to our city and it's visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49
50,Great Place to Visit,I had no knowledge of this museum until a friend asked if I wanted to go. It was so interesting with so many cars and artifacts to see. I will definitely go back again since we only planned 2 hours our first time there. It's a great place to go for an afternoon and I think it's free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesHope
50,What a gem of a place!,Beautiful rare pristine antique cars. So many Rolls Royces dating back to the early 1900's...wow..so many other rare and very valuable automobiles on display as well as a train. It costs nothing to get in...this deserves another wow!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhaddad3
40,Great place to view true works of art.,"Was very impressed with the quality, selection, & variety of cars. Only visited the smaller building, which is as previously mentioned FREE & does not require a tour. To your car enthusiast this is a dream come true. For me, I really appreciate these beautiful cars, but it seemed to get slightly repetitive after awhile for some reason. There were also a few random cars inserted like the van from Home Improvement (Tool Time).All in all though this is a great place for the whole family to visit, somewhere to see cars from an era of greatness long forgotten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerfmeister
40,"Beautiful cars, amazing music....and FREE","We visited the Nethercutt as a group (you need to make a reservation) and had a knowledgable tour guide. This museum is amazing! The cars are beautiful and you'l continually be saying ""wow!"" Who knew that Sylmar held such a treasure?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LwindVta

50,Outstanding and It is Free!,"You can sign up online for a 2 hour tour beginning at 10:00 am or 1:30 pm. You should take the tour, since you will see things you cannot see without the tour. After the tour, go across the street to tour the Nethercutt antique autos on your own. They are amazing. On the 2 hour tour you will see automobiles, musical instruments, dolls and a host of other collectibles. you will also be entertained by a Wurlitzer organ. Everything is free including parking. This is a must do. If you take the tour, allow 3 to 4 hours for everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2travel076
50,Truly amazing,"The Nethercutt is some way north of town and we might have given it a miss had it not fitted in well with returning our hire car to Burbank airport. We are very glad we didn't. It is housed in a modern building and shows a larger number of cars ranging from the late 19th to the mid 20th century, many rare, a few unique. Being Brits, some of the names were unfamiliar to us but that didn't stop us marvelling at the standard of restoration of most of them, though the condition of some of the unrestored ones was also impressive. We couldn't get into the Collection which must be booked in advance and, we understand, books up a month ahead. We did, however, get to see the Canadian Pacific Loco and private carriage outside, both very impressive. Finally, if you visit make sure you search out the mechanical violin. Very clever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133malcolmb
50,Awesome wow,This has to be one of the best attractions we have ever been to. All free and very friendly guides. You must make reservations about a month or more ahead unless someone cancels their tour. The museum alone is well worth the time to go. The exhibits are beyond description. Just go you will miss a fantastic time if you skip this stop on your trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buttley2

50,Hidden Secret in LA,"The Nethercutt is a must see for car buffs, but the reservations only tour of the main building is a must. Not only are there cars, but there is furniture, musical instruments, a recreated car showroom and much, much more. My wife enjoyed the tour as much as I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JakeJ124
50,The best collection of vintage cars in the US!,"What a find! Situated in a rather uninteresting suburb of Los Angeles (Sylmar), this vintage car collection must be one of the greatest in the world; all the cars are 'nut and bolt' restored, perfect condition, and displayed in a beautiful former car showroom. It's free, informative and gives a fascinating glimpse into 20s, 30s and 40s automotive America: one gripe - it would be better to split the car tour and the musical instruments tour separately: it's a long visit for older people, but, the musical displays are fantastic as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanRHamilton
50,An Elegant Venue for Incredible Automobiles,"From the moment you assemble for the ""reservations only"" tour of the main building you feel like this will be special. It is. The boxy plain building does not prepare you for what is inside. The interior is a grand salon of marble, sparkling chandeliers, columns and a sweeping staircase to the second floor. The main floor houses an amazing collection of antique automobiles all in pristine condition. Most are so enormous compared to today's cars that you wonder how anyone could have driven them on the road. The upper floors have hood ornaments, furniture, pipe organ, and a full wall mechanical band. This is an incredible museum that women who appreciate fine things, will enjoy. It's not just for car guys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196CindyJ196

50,"Free, little known car museum in the Valley","First of all none of our friends who are Angelino natives had ever heard of this place. It's a great hidden gem. It's definitely out of the way (in what I think is the north Valley in LA) but it's free! And it is a really cool, really large collection of amazing old cars. We only did the museum with the cars & did not take the guided tour, but if you like cars & have time for the drive over, it's totally worth it (we were literally the only people there).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachela72
50,"Meryl Norman is more than make-up, it's CARS,CARS and more CARS","First this museum is actually two museums. The first is free and open to anyone who walks in. It is a great collection of antique cars ,with a few classic, but not antique vehicles. The is also a locomotive and a classic private railcar to tour at select times (also free). The second museum is across the street (check out the massive bronze entry doors), and can only be visited with a pre-arranged appointment. Go to their web site to arrange an appointment. Do this at least 2-3 weeks before you plan to visit. This museum is known as the COLLECTION. Here you will find some of the finest and choice automobiles in the Nethercutt collection. You will also be entertained by a fine collection of mechanical musical instruments/bandboxes. You will also have a short concert presented on their massive recording pipe organ. A visit to the Nethercutt is well worth a visit. Do expect to walk a lot and be on your feet for a long time. I've been twice and spent at least 4 hours each time. Many people will get ""car'ed out"" as there are so many of them. If you can only spent less than two hours the make reservations for the COLLECTION and see the other part of the museum another time. This facility is wheelchair accessable. Small children are not allowed in the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveb890
50,Great Museum to Experience,This museum is really worth visiting. It is an easy day trip but do make the reservations ahead of time to take the 2 hour guided tour. Then go across the street for a self guided tour of additional cars as well as the train tour. And it's all free. Easy to find off the freeway and lots of free parking. Plan to take at least 3-4 hours walking around to read about all the cars. There are restroom facilities in both locations as well as elevators for those that need it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
50,Awesome Museum,Just an amazing collection of classic cars. You will be impressed. Tours are free but need to make reservations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/general5star1962
50,"All I can say is WOW - the Organ, the Train, and the CARS!","This Museum is completely amazing. I was told about the museum by a coworker. It was so close to where I live I cannot believe I had not heard of it. We started by seeing all the cars in the new building. Then at 12:30 we went out and heard about the train, and the train car, and toured it. It reminded me of a cruise ship on a railroad track. Then we finished the museum and went to the other building for our 1:15 appointment for the first building tour (you need an appointment.) I loved these cars too, especially the $20000 one, but the highlight really is the organ and the other musical instruments upstairs. There were a lot of stairs, but an elevator is available if you need it. Be sure to have a big Breakfast if you plan to spend as long as we did (about 11 am till 3:30 pm). This was a fabulous museum and I could not believe it was complimentary. Would love to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
50,Great Museum,Fantastic collection of old cars and great musical instruments. A must for any visitor to LA and certainly for out of town guests,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892LindaW
50,Car lovers dream,"This museum is a bit off the beaten track, but is well worth the journey for anyone who loves fine automobiles. About 100 classic cars are on display, covering just about every decade of the 20th century, including an impossibly sleek 1937 Talbot-Lago that was a gift from a Maharaja to his wife - a former Folies Bergere dancer born in England as Stella Mudge, and a Rolls Royce limousine that cost actress Constance Bennett $23,000 - in 1930. Incredibly, this museum is free. Also on display is a gorgeous 1912 private rail car, but viewing times for this are limited to two 15 minute periods a day, so be sure to watch your time.Also keep in mind that the separate Nethercutt Collection, which supposedly houses the real cream of the whole collection, is by reserved tour only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOD56
40,Cars!,"These were works of art---crafted and painted lovingly before assembly line depersonalizations set in.

50,Extraordinary Car Museum and Orchestrinas,"The Car museum has beautiful and accurate restored vehicles that are awrd winning and jaw dropping. However the cars in the collection , available only on the two daily tours , are even more extraordinary. Displayed in a venue resembling the LA exclusive Dealerships of the 20's and 30's( A mix of French and Italian elegance of the era ) . The Musical instruments from player pianos to a special type that reproduced not only the notes to the touch and pedaling of a grand piano- we heard the one recorded on paper played back of Rhapsody in Blue played by george Gershwin. The Orchestrinas on the top floor are topped by the 500 feature Wurlitzer played played by an outstanding organist ( Theme from Star Wars, Phantom and The Pink Panther). The other instruments on this floor are totally unique and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmerjer
50,Well worth the trip,This is a really well kept secret attraction. I read about it in the travel section of the Star in Canada and it was news to my LA friends. Have been back several times over the years and always enjoy it. The cars are in mint condition and there is something of interest for everybody. Enjoyed the mechanical music exhibit and collections of furniture and hood ornaments.The newer section has added an old railroad engine and a private rail car exhibit that gives you an idea of how the wealthy travelled before the age of private jets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aileenTorontoCanada
50,Great Visit,"I really enjoyed this attraction. It is far from the central part of Los Angeles. You need a car to drive about 40 minutes from Hollywood. You need advance reservations and the days are limited. It is worth the effort. Fabulous display of antique cars and music boxes. It is supported by Merle Norman Co, the Nethercutt family business.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43judy
50,Make sure you take the (free) tour,"You can just show up and see one large room with lots of cars, but to see the best cars in the collection you have to take the free tour. Make reservations in advance. The tour also lets you see and hear the mechanical music producing machines. These are not your normal ""music boxes"", but huge antique machines with up to 20 instruments. All in working condition. Plus the ""Mighty Wurlitzer"" theater organ. You have to take the tour to see any of these, and they are awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmleler

40,Secret spot anyone who loves cars will love!,"Hidden in the north east end of the San Fernando Valley lies the Nethercutt museum - You'd never know it was there and probably would never find yourself driving through this neighborhood, but trust your feelings, and possibly the force, it exists. An amazing and FREE TO VIEW collection of immaculately kept cars from the very earliest automobiles forward. They're a marvel to look at and photograph. There isn't too much interactive though so it might be a hit or miss for the kids depending on how interested they are in viewing the cars. There is an old train in the back with a guided tour through it but the tours happen at specific times so make sure you're aware of when those are or you'll only be able to see the outside of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickpoet

50,Best thing we saw in Los Angeles,"I'm not even a car person and I was amazed by the 1910's and 1920's car collection in a stunning showroom. The tour guide gave some interesting history that made it even more interesting. It's absolutely essential that you go on one of the day's they're giving tours (tours are free, but you have to make a reservation).Way more amazing than the cars was the collection of musical instruments. A piano with extra keys, mechanically played orchestas, music boxes, and the most amazing organ ever.I highly highly recommend this for any trip to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minnymanda

The buildings are fairly unobtrusive but huge, enough to display a very large selection of period automobiles. You can tour the buildings by appointment only, which must be made in advance. A clear stand-out of the tour is the amazing Wurlitzer organ, hidden away on an upper floor of one of the buildings. They have holiday concerts during the Christmas season. The docent is very informative and the tour is definitely worth doing once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuntressCA
50,Wonderful if a little out of the way...,"Great cars in a far away place. A vast collection of old, perfectly maintained cars. Worth the visit if you are a fan of antique, great quality automobiles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnHonestReviewerX
50,Amazing Collection of Cars and Mechanical Musical Instruments!,"I know, that sounds like an odd combination, but if you are into either cars or large mechanical musical instruments, this is a place you should not miss!Over 150 vintage cars, from Franklins, Duesenbergs, Duponts, Tuckers, Bugattis, Rolls Royces, etc, etc. You get the idea. These are not the common tin lizzys, but cars that were expensive in their day. They have been meticulously restored and are on display in a luxurious setting reminiscent of the auto showrooms in the 20s and 30s. Some are so rare as to be one of only 3 or 4 left in existence! every car is fully functional and they are taken to shows all across the US. Some have even been driven in the Rose Parade!The mechanical musical instruments are not the everyday music boxes or phonographs that you see in antique stores, but unique and beautiful pieces which are intricately designed and breathtaking to watch. Most are fairly large and would probably have been in restaurants, music halls and other gathering places throughout Europe. One even had accordians, drums, a xylophone and violins which played as well or better than most humans could play them!The crowning glory was an old theatre organ (from the old Denver Auditorium) which had ranks of pipes ranging from 1/4"" to 36 feet ranged around the 11000 square foot space and which could replicate any sound imaginable to accompany the silent films of the time. If you are lucky enough to be there when it is ""Silent Film Evening"", you should make every effort to attend!This is truly a rare gem in the City of Angels; it is worth seeking out and enjoying!The Museum is free as is the Collection, but you can only view the Collection on a tour with the curator! Plan to spend several hours, as it is so incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler401
50,If you like to drool over cars.......,"It is way off the beaten path in an industrial area. This was done so Mr. Nethercutt could have his museum next to his office which is Merle Norman Cosmetics.One side is a huge lined up collection of cars and one off cars. Across the street is a sumptuous display area of deco era design. You cannot just enter, you cannot wear jeans. It is all free and breath taking. Make reservations if necessary.Depending on your love level of cars this can take an hour or way more. It is a long stop for me.Many car collectors have their private museums tucked away by their business operations. Why not have your work and play together? This is a larger collection and more accessible than the one by that famous comedian, what’s his name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alextalksbusiness
50,Excellent car museum,"I have been here twice & loved it both times. Their collection of cars is absolutley amazing. Many of their cars are shown at the Pebble Beach Concourse. The cars rotate periodically so your visit is different every time. The tours are free, but you must reserve in advance. They have more than just cars & their collections include antique hood ornaments, time pieces & musical instruments, so there is something for everyone. I highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tr4tam
50,A must for vintage automobile and music buffs,"This hidden treasure in Sylmar is amazing. There are two venues, and both are free!The first is the Nethercutt Museum at 15151 Bledsoe Street. It's open Tuesday through Saturday,9:00 to 4:30. Tours of the vintage automobiles is self-guided and no reservations are required. There is also an old train outside that is open for a guided tour twice a day.The automobiles are all in working condition and are loaned out at times for occasions like the Rose Parade.Across the street at 15200 Bledsoe is San Sylmar, which offers guided tours that last approximately two hours. San Sylmar offers more of the beautiful automobiles on display, as well as other collections of the Nethercutt family and, saving the best for last, the music collection, featuring organs and other spectacular mechanical musical instruments. This collection requires reservations (made online) well in advance.Both collections are beautiful and unique!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingrandma91355
40,A great museum for car freaks,"I am not a car freak, but I tagged along anyway. About a third of the way through I started getting into it. There are over 100 cars exhibited and they are in excellent restored condition for the most part. In addition to the cars the museum houses a small collection of antique music cabinets, some of which you can actually insert a coin in to play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJMom048

50,You Can't Beat The Price!,"One of the top car museums in the world. Everything is immaculate & invitingly displayed. Many historically significant vehicles. Lots of others surprises here including instruments. My favorite is the collection of hood ornaments (or ""mascots""). Best of all, it's all free! I don't know how they do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
50,try it.......its free,I live a couple miles from this place. it is by far my favorite museum in los angeles. the cars are absolutely breathtaking. a little piece of info each car is street legal and can and is operated on the streets around the muesum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DAVIDW28
50,It's free and it's worth it!,"A beautiful car museum to visit, we were invited by a friend for a organ concert with silent movies show, we had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soledadluna
50,bring your camera,Loved the museum - make sure you sign up for the tour....the museum was good but the collection was spectacular.The tour is a couple of hours with very little seating...the organ on the third So floor is worth the tour and walking. There is an elevator for folks who can't do stairs. No food allowed in the museum. So snack when you are waiting to go through the trains...worth the drive and wait.It's FREE too. No children under 16 years to go through the collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheapEats019
50,The auto collection *****,"A first rate collection of fine automobiles, french, british, american from the beginnings through the Corvette. The founder of this free collection is /was obviously committed and the restorations are splendid. (There are a couple of unrestored cars for didactic purposes.) across the street is another building with more cars, music boxes, and other material collected by the founder of Merle Norman cosmetics. I did not see it because it is by tour booking only and the tours were filled up. Plan to eat somewhere else as Sylmar, where this museum is located, has a paucity of choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpmcestmoi
50,Museum AND Collection,"There are three pieces of the attraction, the Museum, the Collection, and the trains.To see the museum you don't need a reservation, however to visit the Collection (aka San Sylmar) you need to reserve one of the allotted tours, which takes two hours. The trains can be toured without a reservation but at specific times only. Worthwhile to visit the collection to hear the Wurlitzer Theater Organ on the top level of the collection. Ladies might now appreciate that there is a Merle Norman cosmetics outlet open adjacent to the collection after the tour. It's all free, including the parking. Yes the female guide is pathetically overbearing, but it's still a five-star hidden gem. The Museum and the Collection both have handicap access, but not the trains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
50,what a great place for guys,"I have been to the Nethercutt a couple times. It is sooo amazing, for guys. Men do you wife/girlfriend a favor, send them to mall, spa or salon but unless they are Shirley Muldowney or Danica Patrick or similar they will not enjoy this one much. I booked the tour and taken the men from our church men's group we had such a blast, and getting so close to history. I just should caution No Flash Photography, by no, that means NO! If you plan on taking pictures use the best camera you have as NO FLASH s useable. I also recommend even of you don’t book the tour (Which is free and takes 2-3 hours depending on guide) definitely go to the Auto museum across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travlinpastor
50,A Little Known Gem,"My wife and I stumbled on the Nethercutt Museum doing a Google search while visiting relatives in Los Angeles. Based on the fact that none of the three families of relatives had heard of the museum, I think the Nethercutt isn't widely known or appreciated. But it should be. The museum has a spectacular collection of marvelously restored--and, in some cases, not restored but carefully preserved--antique cars. This is a must see for car lovers. But, my wife, who is not a car lover, enjoyed it greatly too. You don't have to know what a flat-head engine is to be fascinated by this peak into America's history with it's most beloved invention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dhubin
50,"If you've the slightest interest in cars, or mechanical musical instruments - Go!","The Nethercutt is actually in two buildings: the Museum which is open most days to walk in visitors, and the Collection across the road which is only available by pre-booked guided tours available through their web-site (and which fill up weeks in advance). Both are free courtesy of the money the Nethercutts made from Merle Norman cosmetics.In my opinion, the Collection is the better.Both buildings are packed with cars, mainly pre-1960, and all restored/rebuilt to showroom condition. There is also the ""Royal Hudson"" steam locomotive and carriage out the back of the museum; and a variety of cafe organs, a reproducing piano (that plays Rhapsody in Blue from a roll made by George Gershwin), and one of the biggest Wurlitzer organs in the world, in the Collection. These are played during the guided tour, which takes over two wonderful hours.Ideally, allow another couple of hours for the Museum.If you've any interest in this sort of stuff, this is a don't miss in southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickandpauline

50,Great Museum,"Many times I have been to the Nethercutt Museum which is actually in Sylmar; north of Los Angeles. It is a very, very interesting museum with fabulous cars they have on display. In the summer time, Sylmar can be very hot. You need to call and make a reservation before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
50,Amazing place,"Lovely setting, some great pieces of art and well worth a visit to get away from the busyness of LA.Following the tour we took the time for a quick lunch, and then went back to have a closer look at the Museum. The visit took the whole day. We are interested in veteran, vintage and classic cars, and so found it a wonderful experience.his is the museum open to everybody...not the special collection housed across the street and open only by invitation.

No flash photography is allowed but they do allow you to use your camera. Go you will not be disapointed and its FREE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riskman

50,Always Enjoyable,"The Nethercutt Museum is alway a hit. It is a surprising mixture of antique cars that are beautifully restored and a wonderful collection of antique musical instruments, furniture and more. Don't miss the concert in the music room. It's terrific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSW842
50,A gem of an attraction in Los Angeles and it's FREE!!,"We first learnt of this museum from watching Huell Howser on KCET's ""California's Gold"". We visited this magnificent museum and took the 2 hour ""Nethercutt Collection"" tour just this past week. Oh my!... this museum and the ""Collection"" house one of the most pristine assembly of early 20th century classic cars as well as musical instruments. The Nethercutt museum and the ""Collection"" are in two separate buildings, across from each other in Sylmar in San Fernado Valley, which is about 30 miles from Los Angeles. Both these attractions are open to the public for free, however the twice daily tours of the Collection are available only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and need advance reservation. On the Friday that we went on the tour, there were about 50 attendees. There are roughly about 150 to 200 cars displayed at any one time between the museum and the collection. Those of us who are car buffs could easily spend the whole day marvelling at these vintage, antique and classic cars, and their meticulous restoration. A prized collection among the cars displayed in the Grand Salon (only seen during the tour) is a 1933 Duesenberg - ""20 Grand"", hand-built for the 1933/34 Chicago World Fair and bought by Mr. Archer Daniel for the full price (when the average car price was less than a grand)!. I was told by the docent that this magnificent car today is insured for $12 Million, but is worth much more! The Nethercutt collection also houses a fantastic array of mechanical musical instruments that include the Nickelodians and Orchestrions, and a one of a kind grand Wurlizer pipe organ. The audience was treated to performances on the Orchestrions and Nickelodians, and also a mini concert on the pipe organ. We also stayed back to see the 1912 Pullman private coach car which was custom built for Mr. Nethercutt's oldest daughter Clara. All in all, we had a very enjoyable visit to the Nethercutt museum and the collection tour...we still have not got over the fact that unlike most other similar museums, the Nethercutt family has kept these attractions free to the public for our viewing pleasere. Thank you Nethercutt Foundation and also Huell Howser for this opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexkuruvi

50,"If you love cars, do not miss this museum","This museum has an amazing collection of vehicles from every era. All the vehicles have personalized license plates. I just loved a license plate on a really old car - ""I'm old"" was a reall ""aw"" moment for me. There is a lovely stair case with carpeting in a keyboard pattern with the notes to ""Stairway to the Stars."" The second floor has a huge organ and a lovey collection of hood ornaments and other car accessories. A wonderful place to visit - especially with young children who appreciate the cars from grandpa and grandma's era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luvsailing
50,Can't believe it was free,What a great museum! I can't believe that it was free to get in and also for the tour. I highly recommend making a reservation to take the tour otherwise you will miss seeing some beautiful things in the other building. Even if you are not into vintage vehicles it is still impressive to see this collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zee74
50,"Great collection, great time: Plan ahead.","We found multiple ‘collections’ as a surprise. After starting in the main building with a great collection of antique cars we found another tour was available: They have restored an antique train car with locomotive in the back of the building. The craftsmanship and care given was very obvious.If you plan ahead you can make reservations to take a tour of the original museum across the street. This contained the cream of the crop from the car collection in an unbelievable salon.It was fantastic to be able to get close to these great pieces of automotive history.Then we were shuffled to the second level where there were several displays of trophies, hood ornaments and a few musical instruments.After that the final collection on the third floor was as unexpected as it was enjoyable: The room was filled with antique musical nickelodeons, pianos and a huge Wurlitzer theater organ. The docent demonstrated some of these instruments which was fun.Our only complaint is there were too many people allowed in the tour, making seeing all the cars difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad_LA

Worth a visit if you enjoy collections, or are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/js551
50,Fabulous Collection - worth the drive,"There is no charge for this 2 hour tour. The collection of cars is alone worth the drive in the rain and snow over the grapevine. The tall building houses such amazing things - clocks, organs, cars, hood ornaments, and so much more. It has yummy carpet and gorgeous mirrors and chandeliers. The bathroom is even a showpiece. It is hard to begin to say anything that will describe the experience of seeing all the furnishings and also all the collections. Then we went across the street to the smaller building housing 150 more gorgeous cars. The people were so amazed at the care the cars are given. The train wasn't available due to the heavy rain, but we had a great time and everyone there is helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoseannaS

50,An amazing experience that you won't soon forget!,"I had never heard of this museum before, so I was skeptical about what my tour may entail. I was surprisingly amazed at what I found. The guided tour of their 4-story museum took about 2-3 hours (You can't quit early, so plan on staying; they do have elevators though for those who need it). There are dozens of historical cars to see. They had all been restored to mint-condition, and all of them are in working order if you can believe it! You can look, but you may not touch. Pictures are allowed, but not video, and flash photography is banned. They had cars dating back to the late 1800's (steam-powered cars). Most of the cars were dated between 1900-1960, some later. It was something I had never seen before. I'm not a car buff, but I really enjoyed it. There was also a collection of hood ornaments, awards, musical devices, and collectibles to see.The tour ended with a presentation of giant musical boxes and nickelodeons in a large corporate entertaining room. It was wonderful to ponder the innovation of these old machines as they entertained with beautiful music. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience I haven't found anywhere else. If you really enjoy it, you can return for concert events. Search their website for further information.Across the street from the touring building is a secondary building (it's much more modern looking, and we mistook it for where the tour was going to be). Inside there are several dozen more cars. Again, all were in mint-condition. This building allowed visitors to view at their own pace, but you couldn't get as close to the cars because of them being contained in a roped-off area. Behind this secondary building was a fenced off area that held a locomotive and rail car. Unfortunately, it was closed on the day we visited due to a photo-shoot, but if it was like the rest of the collection, I'm sure it is amazing.The best part of this tour is that it is FREE. That's right, it was free. You just need to make a reservation. If you visit here, I'm sure you will enjoy it just as much as I did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DW-Surprise
50,Don't miss this amazing car collection,"My husband and I spent about two hours looking at the cars, trucks and chassis' at the Nethercutt Museum outside of Los Angeles. My favorite was a limousine with travelodge-trailer and built by Pierce-Arrow in 1937 that we could go inside to inspect. The cars are amazing. So many of them and all but one perfectly restored. I am not a car person but I found myself reading all about who owned the car, where it was built, etc and was fascinated. I am looking forward to taking the tour of the Nethercott collections on our next trip to Southern California. We went on a Tuesday and were there with only six or eight other people. We found the Nethercutt easily with our Tom-tom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilex1
50,Awesome Antique Cars & Much More,"The museum is free. The car collection is extensive and varied with wonderful labeling. I had never heard of many of the old makes and models. We enjoyed the collection of old hood ornaments. They have a restored steam engine outback with a luxury Pullman car attached. It was fun to see how traveling by rail compared to the Titantic. The ""Collection"" (also free) is across the street from the museum and is full of more cars, and antique musical instruments. This is open to see by appointment only and we did not reserve in time for the twice a day tour. So we will definitely be back when we visit our friend in California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmojo

50,A magnificent collection of automobiles,"We were advised before visiting the Nethercutt Museum that if we wanted to see the Nethercutt Collection we would need to call ahead and make a booking. We took the advice, and arrived in time to park in the free carpark, and have a quick look around the Museum. We discovered that it is very large, and needed more time, so we decided to do that after seeing the Collection at the appointed time. It is housed in a specially built facility directly across the road from the Museum.We were met outside and welcomed by the curator of the Collection, and then escorted into the lower level of the Collection. There were about 50 or 60 people on the tour, and it took about two and a half hours to do. The facility is beautiful, and the cars are in magnificent condition, and presented in a very grand setting. There are collections of hood ornaments from the era represented by the car collection, including a Lalique crystal assortment. There is also wonderful collection of automated mechanical instruments including musical repeat striking watches, Swiss bird boxes, cylinder and disc music boxes, and grand pianos - and we were able to listen to a broad selection of them. The grand finale is listening to a selection of music played on the the 5,000-piped Wurlitzer Theatre Organ on the upper level.Following the tour we took the time for a quick lunch, and then went back to have a closer look at the Museum. The visit took the whole day. We are interested in veteran, vintage and classic cars, and so found it a wonderful experience.So, if you are planning to see the Museum don't just turn up - plan ahead and book yourself in to the tour of the Collectiion. And the best bit is it's all free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coupleofaussies
50,Best Kept Secret of LA,"We first visited the museum with Day Tripper Tours, a popular bus tour company. The choice was based on my husband's interest, not mine, however, even if you could care less about looking at ""old"" cars, this museum is fascinating. The collections are lovingly and beautifully presented; this is not your typical museum. Nor is it a museum/collection that would appeal to children. Various web sites share excellent pictures, but they cannot convey the feeling of awe.I just wish they would open the gourmet employees cafeteria to the public; finding restaurants in the area is very difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halelani
40,A Car Guys' Oasis,"I'd always planned on visiting the Nethercutt Collection and finally made it happen in January, 2008. The museum was initially difficult to find for someone as unprepared as I. Look for the tallest building in Sylmar; that'll be the Merle Norman Cosmetics factory. The museum is across the street.This is the museum open to everybody...not the special collection housed across the street and open only by invitation. The ""regular"" museum is a breath of fresh air for money-grabbing Southern California because...it's absolutely free of charge. No admission is charged. Parking is free. Such a deal!The collection deals mostly with pre-war vehicles, the preferred taste of Mr. Nethercutt himself. If you're anticipating some Muscle Cars from the 1960s, you're going to be disappointed. The collection also displays a fine Canadian Steam locomotive behind the building.It's out of the way, hard to find and has a somewhat limited perspective of interest, but the Nethercutt Museum is certainly worth a visit when you're in Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/horizonbound
