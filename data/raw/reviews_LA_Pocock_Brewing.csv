50,"Knowledgeable staff, great selection and some outstanding craft brews!","My son brought me here yesterday and I was extremely impressed. They 20 or so brewed on the premises craft beers. In addition to half a dozen IPAs they had a great selection of darker beers, stouts, porters, browns, etc. Particularly notable was ""Construction Delay"" (Russian imperial stout) and ""the rooster who knew too much"" (golden strong ale aged 16 months in petite sirah barrels!).",Peter B
40,Nice Place After a Long Week,"Found this place while in town on business. After a long week it was a great stop for good beers all around. Big, busy space with a food truck out front.Did a flight, plus three additional tasters and enjoyed each beer I had.If I’m ever back in the area it’s a definite stop.",Adam A
50,Great stop after a trip around the river trail,Stopped by here after a ride around the river trail for a pint. They have good Beer friendly servers (almost always the two owners who are brothers). Place is clean inside and they let us bring our bikes in since they haven’t gotten approval from the city for a bike rack out front yet. They often have a food truck our front that has good food as well. Nothing like cooling off with a cold pint of good beer after a ride and this is the perfect place to do It.,Scottydoesntknow661
50,"A Great Beer Tasting Room, No Matter Your Taste","I've never been the first to review something before, so I'm excited to do it for a local place that I really love. It's especially cool, because this is also my 50th review!Over the years, I've been to a lot of microbreweries and beer tasting rooms. You can almost always find something you like, and just as much, you are also likely to taste a beer or two that you hate. At Pocock, what amazes me is they have 16-20 beers at any given time, and I like ALL of them. They have lagers, ales, stouts, IPAs, double IPAs, and a bunch more. I've made a concerted effort to try everything they have, and they are all really good. Nothing is nasty bitter; nothing is too weak and insipid. It is all flavorful, and all worth trying. You might not love some of it, but you will probably like all of it. I took one friend who ""doesn't like beer,"" and he even found something he likes. Now, he's a regular!They use a device called a Randall to infuse some of their beers with flavors, such as blueberry, banana, coffee, etc., but the majority of their beers are straight, unflavored. They also do experiments with aging beers in wine or bourbon barrels. (If you see that offered, try one, because they don't last long.)Sometimes, it is hard to choose just one beer, and that's why I'm thankful for ""flights,"" where you can try five small pours of different beers. A full flight is about the same amount of alcohol as a 12 oz can, I think, so it's a good way to try a lot of beer without getting inebriated. (Although at about $12, it can be pricy, compared to just getting a glass.)The servers at Pocock are almost always the owners, who are also the beer-masters, who are also the bus boys. They do everything. They are also a nice bunch of people, and if it isn't too busy, are happy to explain to you how each beer is made, what goes into them, what the different flavor profiles are like, and to make recommendations based on your tastes. (But don't be too picky: My favorite experiences are trying things I didn't think I would like, like a mango ale, or a Russian Imperial Stout.)Because each beer is hand-drawn from an old-fashioned tap, it can take a while to get your order, especially with stuff that has to be slow-pulled, so don't expect quick service. This is especially true if you order a flight. The wait is worth it.Although Pocock only serves bar snacks, they try to excel at that as well, and serve stuff like locally made jerky.Since man cannot live on beer alone, it helps that on most evenings and weekends, a food truck is parked outside. They usually have Taco Thursdays and Wing Wednesdays, and various other foods on weekends. These trucks tend more towards comfort food than healthy food, with lots of BBQ meat, fried stuff, etc. I think you can also bring your own food, if you don't want to descend into a spiral of beer and fast food.If you are a trivia buff, on Wednesday night, Pocock has ""Trivia with Bud,"" which is always busy, but a reason I personally avoid Wednesdays, as it gets too loud for casual conversation, and I'm not a trivia fan. They have a couple of TVs for whatever games are in season, but it isn't a sports bar.What's the downside? Well, maybe the location. It's in an industrial park that is not near anything you are likely to go to in Valencia. It's great if you work nearby (which I do), but somewhat hard to find if you don't. The parking lot can fill up, and there is an ambulance company in the same lot that restricts many of the other spaces, so be careful, or you might be towed. Also, some nights, there is no food truck, so if you arrive expecting to get dinner, you may have to order from Grub Hub or a local pizza joint.Prices start at $2-3 for a pour (taste), and go up to $5-7-ish for a glass, and then they have ""crowlers"" (can-growlers) and growlers on top of that. If you love beer, and want to experience new types of beer, then Pocock is worth a visit.",David G
