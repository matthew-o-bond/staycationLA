50,Great place,We have been here several times and i have been meaning to write this for some time now. The staff is great and keeps everyone safe. They are on top of shooters that are being careless. The facility keeps getting improvements and over the years it has seen lots of improvements. Bring water and snacks and check the forecast before heading out.,Redman367
20,Unhappy shooter,"My first time to ever use a range and did not know what to expect, I wanted to zero in my scope. When I paid the entrance fee they told me they were not allowing paper targets. I assumed I would be provided with some type of readable target I was not. They had targets at different ranges 100 yards ect. but I could not tell weather or not i was hitting them, so basically I was shooting at a hill. If you can't tell where your bullets are going you accomplish nothing it's at total waste of time and money. The other ranges they provided looked adequate.Roy from Lancaster.",Cheryl A
40,I Shot the Sheriff!,"Everyone over the age of 55 remembers that song (I Shot the Sheriff by eric clapton) Well what does THAT have to do with A Place to Shot? Nothing, I like the name, that's all. A Place to Shot is just that...To Shoot. First it is all outdoors. so you have to contend with wind, HEAT and thirst! So dress for and bring water to prohibit you going into shock! Next, targets. One must purchase their target stands. Now here is the tricky part. ""IF"" you are an expert and manage to NOT sever the wooden sticks that hold the targets Up. Well then you get some of your deposit back. ME??? I didn't worry about it and blasted away! Now there are coupons around. I've had one for five years and always forget to bring it. There is a gun store for ammo, but of course it will be priced reflective of most range prices. A Place to Shot does have different operating hours so call ahead or check online. BE AWARE, that this range is located in an area that is prone to Brush Fires and there is ONLY ONE WAY IN AND OUT! Well there is two but the other will take you out of most people's way by 50 miles +. I would not recommend this place to smaller children (under 9 yrs) or older persons with a fragile medical condition. (My RN Opinion). BEFORE you go, plan what your bringing, how to store it while in your car, and general gun safety if your bringing a friend who doesn't shot all the time. All Ranges have their own separate gun safety rules that they adhere to STRICTLY! I mean such so that after an initial warning they will ask you to leave and never come back. So don't be a wise guy or bring a automatic machine gun and fire 300 rounds a minute! It won't happen, this is California. I believe that most gun owners know this and should have no issue at all. I rate this place good but not great (I like indoor ranges more). It is close to Santa Clarita and especially the people in Saugus. Who hate that name.",Steve
40,Better on weekdays,They weekends here are very busy. I hate crowds especially shooting. Weekdays are much better. About a 10 to 15 min drive up San Francis Quito canyon Rd north of valencia,wvillamil
40,Perfect place to shoot,"I have lived in the area for 25+ years. I remember when the only places to shoot locally was the desert, which was sketchy at best, and Dry Gulch which I actually saw someone get hit with a bullet (he lived).The place is well laid-out and safe. I recommend it if you are wanting a safe environment and helpful staff.",Vin S
50,Relaxation,Great local range that has lots of shooting options. We'll run and safety is primary to all shooters. Ammo is available but call in advance to make sure it's in stock. A range fee is required.,WMSCV
50,Two thumbs up.,"My husband and my two boys, frequently visit A place to Shoot, and we always find a table extremely helpful people. We have use two different places one in Van Nuys and the other one by the 5frwy in Valencia neither one was as good as A place to shoot. It's a little bit out of the way, but maybe that's what makes it better. Less crowed.",Maria C
40,Exersice your 2ND Amendment rights,A very nice place to spend a few hours. Today I went to the pistol target range. The place is clean and well kept. The staff is courteous and helpful. Fridays 1/2 off for seniors 55+.,thibbs1955
40,Target Practice Spot ...,"The shooting range, Place to Shoot, is a nice long distance range conveniently sited in the foothills above Santa Clarita. Easy to reach and has convenient lanes and distances. Well marked and professionally run with safety being paramount. Keep your shooting eye sharp by passing some range time. Enjoy! ...",David B L
50,A great place to shoot,"Staff at one place are great. Very few idiots and the majority no how to handle a firearm. I have always had a spot to shoot trap, hand gun and high power rifles when I go. I have visited on the weekends and weekdays. And what is best is the price.",718dong
30,Shooting range just north of santa clarita,This is the better priced option for shooting in SCV. The range is not as ket up as Oak Tree. Going during the week is always a better option than going on the weekend with the masses.,svillamil
50,best range in L.A. area,"pro:remote location (it's PAST the mobile home park!)outdoorssells ammo at fair pricesnot overly crowdedlow entry fee (with no time limit)convenient parkingpaperwork is minimal and fastcon:remote locationno gun rentalsmostly no shadeporta-pottyno amenitiesIts lack of crowds, particularly on a weekday (closed tue and wed), makes it my favorite range. I hate having to shoot near punks showing off to their girlfriends, or letting their girlfriends shoot for the first time (putting me in danger). Haven't seen any of that here.Bottom line: my favorite range in the L.A. area, and worth the drive.",mavenbay
30,Good local place,"Not far up san francisquito canyon from Valencia. The weekends are busy. Be aware of idiots that don't know how to handle firearms, they are everywhere. The price is good and they have a variety of ranges. The ammo is expensive here if you don't bring your own.",wvillamil
30,"Just like it says, a place to shoot","Nice facilities, hand cocked clay thowers, pistol and rifle ranges and some steel targets. Only drawback would be the lack of long range targets on the rifle range.",Peter B
