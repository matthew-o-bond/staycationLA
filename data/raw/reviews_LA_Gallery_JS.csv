50,Absolutely. Gorgeous.,"This gallery has stunning photographs of nature printed on metal. The moment I stepped inside the gallery I felt my body relax and my heart rate slowed down. There is something therapeutic about looking at a moment of our beautiful planet captured in a photograph. The photographer, Jill, has that gift. They may not even tell you, but you can order artwork and have it shipped to hour home. Or you can just enjoy the photography. You will definitely enjoy the time you spend here :)",Erin G

40,Outstanding,"We were just strolling down the street and were drawn into the Gallery by the art and photography. My wife was hooked on the art, I found the photography to be amazing. Prices seemed reasonable and if were were not flying home, there would have been two pieces walking out the door with us. Even if you are not interested in buying it's well worth the visit just to admire the skill and talent shown by the two artists",Robert C
50,Such talent in this gallery!,"If you are looking for some original art and photography, you must visit Gallery JS. Both artists are extremely talented.
