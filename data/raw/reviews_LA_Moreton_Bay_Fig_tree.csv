50,Impressive fig tree and great for climbing,"Right next to the Beverly Hills sign is this very impressive fig tree planted by an Australian in the 19th century. If you want a taste of Australia, see how high you can climb up in the huge branches.",mrdom
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"The Morton Bay Fig Tree is a unique and very large tree that got its water for decades from the original nearby Lily Pond that had a clay bottom.The new Lily Pond is cement, so the tree will not be drinking as much water now.The tree has different shapes throughout and parts of the tree has spooky looking limbs hanging from it.The tree is a popular spot with locals and tourists alike.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
