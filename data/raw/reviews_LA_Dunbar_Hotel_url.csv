50,Beautiful part of Los Angeles History-The Dunbar!!!!,"Every time I go to the Dunbar, I feel the great energy of musicians that passed through. It's hard to believe that I stand in the place where greats once mingled and created and convened and jammed. I'm so glad that someone saw the jewel in the dust, picked it up, and dusted it off.Julio H.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280julioh
50,The DUNBAR is Magnificent,"I went to a reading of an original play entitled ""The Magnificent Dunbar Hotel"" produced by the Robey Theatre Company at the restored Dunbar Hotel on Central Ave. The play features historical characters including Paul Robeson, Joe Louis, Lena Horne, Ethel Waters, W. E. B Dubois, newspaper editor Charlotta Bass as well a Jan Perry who was the councilwoman who pushed to get the Dunbar restored to it's former glory. A landmark of Los Angeles' African American history, the Dunbar was the meeting place for great minds to gather to affect change in the Black community. The beauty of the restored Dunbar is a piece of history to be treasured and the ""The Magnificent Dunbar Hotel"" written by Levy Lee Simone and directed by Ben Guillory is a must see play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50cydneyd

The hotel restoration included cleaning the 3 murals & maintaining the fountain in the lobby entrance, The interior of the entrance was however redesigned. The magnificient, glass & iron chandalier that hung in the entrance of the Dunbar is on the floor of the huge room being renovated with the prospect of becoming a cabaret. Be sure to peek in through the glass to see the chandalier..The exterior, art deco facade has been cleaned up & the neon sign illuminated. Dignity has been restored to the hotel that housed many black musicians when they could not be checked into Los Angeles hotels after having performed in famous venues during the 40s & 50s.The area was a mecca for jazz clubs during the Dunbar's illustrious time.The Dunbar will be of great interest to jazz fans, those interested in restauration of historic buildings, & students of the social climate of the 40s, 50s & 60s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmmla91U
50,Central Avenue Jazz Festival,"In honor of the historical Dunbar Hotel built in 1928 , a street festival is held annually on 42nd and Central Ave in Los Angeles. This celebration is close to a Nawlins Mardi Gras celebration with a mixed crowd of young and old dressed in colorful attire, food vendors and dancing in the streets. The Dunbar Hotel is being renovated and the outside windows will remain the same. Waiting to see the beauty of restoration come alive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsDeb60
50,remembering the times,"I remember living across the street from this building back in the 70's. ( 1046 E 42nd place ), obviously not knowing how great it was. I do remember sitting on the curb as a kid admiring all the trucks and equipment of the movie crews which blocked the street while filming scenes of 'Petey Wheatstraw' with XXX comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whom I remember occupied a corner apartment on the first floor. ( I remember touring the apartment with a few neighbors and recall the apartment being dimly lit, but filled with bright red furnishings. ( a lot of velvet). I was saddened to again see that in maybe '81 or so, how abandoned and run-down looking it had become. From once a busy place where several stars would frequent to an empty building where childhood friends from the block along with myself would ride our bikes in the vacant lot behind it and have mud fights in the months when it rained heavily and the lot would fill with water. Sad that it""s become just an apartment building with so much of it's history being unknown to the people who occupy it, but happy to know that it's still there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammie3369
40,Great Historic Building - No longer a hotel!,"The Dunbar Hotel was built in 1928 by John Alexander Somerville in order to afford African Americans with elegant accommodations during their stay in Los Angeles. It was named after African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The hotel often hosted famous guests like Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Cab Calloway and other jazz legends. Nowadays the Dunbar is an apartment building, but it still offers old charm and is worth a look while you're walking down Central Avenue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashyhead81
