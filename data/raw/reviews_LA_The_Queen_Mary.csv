50,Wonderful experience!,I took a day trip to the Queen Mary. I bought the ticket online and signed up for three tours back to back. The Haunted tour runs long so next time I would do that tour last. The tour guides were knowledgeable and entertaining. The ship was clean and easy to navigate. The photos at sunset were great!,Lucky RN
40,Tour before your cruise,We had a drink in the bar. A tour the day before a cruise on the Carnival Panorama.The Queen Mary is nice but not sure if I would stay overnight as well. I would recommend a tour though as it is history.,pspoker

50,Absolute perfection on every level!,"My daughter & I were so fortunate to have found lemonade during a super “lemon” moment! Our Princess cruise to the Mexican Riviera had been cancelled & this amazing historic ship that stayed in port was a true gem! The extraordinary learning experience, beauty, ambiance & staff could not have been better! Thank you to everyone we encountered ❣️",pamwhj
40,Great Customer Service,I had purchased tickets ahead of time but had to postpone my trip due to the Covid 19 situation.I called and was told that my tickets had no expiry. I then emailed and quickly received an email confirming that my tickets are good up to 2028.My son is obsessed with cruise ships and we will be visiting at some point.I just wanted to point out that I was happy with the customer service I received. Companies like this need support during this situation and I will be attending when I can.,keshort78
50,Great tour and afternoon out!,Went to the Observation Bar for lunch which was fun! Food was good... Tour of Queen Mary was great! History tour by Kelly was really well done!,Janine R
40,Night Before Cruise,We stayed here the night before our cruise on the Carnival Panorama. She is an old beauty. Room was comfortable and clean. It was a little stuffy so we opened the porthole windows. Not a luxury hotel for sure but worth the stay for those interested in the history and a quick walk to the cruise terminal.,Selena A
40,Queen Mary Tour,We visited the Queen Mary as an optional tour while in Pasadena for the Rose Parade. The ship is docked in Long Beach and is a very beautiful area. From the ship you can see the skyline of Long Beach. The ship is very beautiful with all the wood and brass and some of the original features of the ship. We learned a lot of historical facts from this tour and would recommend seeing it.,rsweezy
50,Loved our day on the Queen Mary,"We booked our tour of the Queen Mary via trip advisor before our holiday & printed off our voucher. We could see the Queen Mary from our hotel room & took the free bus from over the road to the ship. The voucher was exchanged for tickets including 3 informative tours. We spent the whole of a very enjoyable day there, having arrived at about 10:30am & leaving at 5:15pm. The tours were each 1hour long & took us into places we would not have seen on our own. We throughly enjoyed all the information & historical detail we were given by the guides. We had time between the tours to have lunch & a tea break in the afternoon & to look around areas on our own not included in the tours & to see the Winston Churchill display & the 4D film. Came down in the lift on our way out with a bride & groom preparing for pre wedding photos. A great day & we will go back if we visit Long Beach again.",lilley21
50,The haunted tour had some creepy moments,"We had dinner & drinks in the bar on the Queen Mary before our haunted tour & enjoyed our pizza & pretzel bites & drinks. The haunted tour really showed us a lot of the ship. Most of the tour was just interesting but the boiler room was legitimately creepy. It was cold & wet & dark down there & if you have any imagination, you can totally freak yourself out. We don't believe in ghosts but we watch a lot of horror movies & they could film a great one on that ship. It was a fun evening before leaving on a cruise.",heatherminier
50,Queen Mary hotel,"My husband & his family, 10 people immigrated from Belgium in 1953 & travelled on the Queen Mary. During the stay they were able to find on their computer the manifest showing the passenger list of his family, & they were able to email us this manifest. My husband was 10 at the time. The Queen Mary’s visit was on my husbands bucket list",Janice V
50,Great place to visit,This is a great experience for everybody and yes you can even stay here as it is a hotel. Take the option to do the extra tours as this will give you a greater insight to the ship and its history. I enjoyed the one that took you down into the engine rooms.,Paul A
40,Nice day out on the Queen Mary,"Although the ship needs a coat of paint externally, the experience is worth the $30 entry fee. We toured the ship and had lunch which was good and well priced. History and pictures/photos are interesting.",Alan O
30,Had to go,Having seen the Queen Mary as a working liner just had to visit. Disappointed with the self guided tour did not think there was enough information signage. Churchill war rooms were excellent although the brochure states that Hitler annexed Australia!!,haggis502
50,Scots Festival fun,Really enjoyed the event. Plenty of things to see and neat historical parts to the actual boat.Didn’t try the food - the lines were too long.,TravlLuv
30,Nostalgic visit,"My Canadian friend enjoy visiting the Queen Mary and walking through the corridors in the footsteps of her mother who arrived from England as a war bride.The tour was okay, tour guide was excellent, restaurant was surprisingly good.",DayTrip48545
50,Our fathers were passengers on her,"If you are visiting Long Beach put this on your calendar. This is one big ship. If you are going to do a walking tour make sure you have good shoes on. I can’t remember our guides name but he knew everything about the Queen Mary. We visited the bridge, engine rooms and main lobby. I remember my father and father in law talking about her during WW2.You can also eat and have a drink to onboard.",James C
50,Sure Seeing,"The Queen Mary is a Beautiful, Historical Landmark ,located in Long Beach, California..Long Beach is close to Lax Airport by 21 miles, and close to Orange County Airport approx 20 miles..Queen Mary has Tours of the Oceanliner, many Nice Restaurants, and Events on Board the Ship ! It is a Beautiful Setting in Downtown Long Beach, that has the LB Aquarium, Many Restaurants at the LB Pike area.and LB Convention Center. Stop to see this Historical Landmark !",beverlyc886

40,The Queen Mary,"My mother in law, who is now 90 went on the Queen Mary with her mother and grandmother in 1939. They went to New York to see some family and to the Worlds fair.As we were off on a cruise from Long Beach CA, we decided to stay overnight and see if we could find out a little more of her trip all those years ago.We did in fact find out that she went 2nd class, and that her dining room is now a dining room for the crew.The ship is still glorious, but in some places a little dated/shabby. But it’s stepped in history.Would highly recommend a visit, very interesting.Especially the engine room section.We stayed overnight....not luxurious- but adequate.It’s also very convenient location to pick up the cruise ship.",terrible73
50,Fascinating old ship,"The Queen Mary is well worth a visit, stay if you can. There is lots to see and it has an illustrious history. It’s interesting to compare the luxury of the 1930s with the flagship Carnival Panorama berthed alongside. It was great to stay here for 2 nights before setting off on a cruise to México.",RFE1
50,Loved it,It was amazing to tour- we did the historical tour and it was great! We got free admission with our convention- so the tour was $10. Well worth it. Don't miss this!,Chewiesmom2
40,History,If you like history take the guided tours. there are 3 types of day tours one starting every hour from 11am and each take about an hour to complete. If you get hungry there is a Sarbucks snach shop or a sit down table service restaurant. In the evening they have some higher priced places you can go.The ship is howing its age and I feel that the staff are not reacting in time. There are some large patches of missing paint from the hull and one room must have had a water leak as its smelled musky.Overall it was a nice visit again after 40+ years.I would like to suggest that if the Russian submarine is never going to be opened to the public to get rid of it. Its a sore sight for the eyes and even though its been 40 years I still remember the broken window on the conning tower of the submarine!,BruceH334
40,Love the QM,"We visited the QM five years ago as a day trip and my family really wanted to stay this trip despite the hotel reviews.The staff were helpful from arrival and an earlier checkin was smooth. We loved our mini suite and the views of Long Beach through the two portholes.We left them open to cool the rooms as it is stuffy.We did the regular ship tour and the 7pm ghost tour with our 13 year old which were great, we saw new areas of the ship on the ghost tour the regular tour doesn’t go to.Dinner at the Chowder Room was so enjoyable the staff were brilliant.Not so impressive was the small Starbucks as the staff didn’t want to be there and it doesn’t stock much at all.Loved the gift shops and free range of the Boiler room and cinema.At midnight 1am and 2am we were woken by our neighbours who were just talking but the QMs walls are so thin the noise just travels.My husband went to the gym at 7am and another guest opened our door and came in, he promptly left when he saw us. Apparently our room had been marked vacant so they checked the poor guy into our room with an early checkin of 7.30am. We were given a 30% discount.No hot water for my daughters shower in the evening but we had hot water in the morning.No room fridge.We valet parked for safety with the one other car that was valet parked for $30.There are 300 hotel rooms, surely when the hotel isn’t full, putting guests next door to each room could be mostly avoided due to the noise. This should be a priority, employ more cleaners to turn over the rooms quickly. The hotel reviews would improve.The QM is most definitely worth a long visit but consider wether you want to stay onboard. She is desperately in need of investment and restoration.",Michelle B
50,A fun place to stay,We had a wonderful time spending the weekend here for my graduation! The accommodations were complicated and the shower took some getting used to but those can easily be overlooked. There is little need to stay in your room when you are on a museum and right next to the tourist traps (with a free shuttle). You can wander the ship with a drink in your hand and look at all it has to offer. If I ever happen to be in long beach for leisure again I will stay here.,LOSER
40,Tracing my Grandmother's footsteps,"To walk the same decks and imagine what it must have been like to travel from/to England on this magnificent ship in the 1960's as my, sadly dearly departed, grandmother did, was a more moving experience than I had expected. The free walking areas of the ship that we explored, including drinks in what was the First Class bar, were most enjoyable. We had lunch prior to our arrival so there was no need to try the food. The ever increasing costs of its upkeep seems reflected in its tired appearance in some areas. Here's hoping that this beautiful ship gets an injection of life unlike its poor neighbour, the listing submarine, that looks as if it's been rammed by The Queen!",NandR
50,Better than we thought it would be!,"Since we (family with adult children) had tons to do in the area on vacation, we arrived after 6:00 pm for the discounted entry ticket of $13.00. To our (great) surprise, our ticket was also redeemable for a $10.00 credit for food and drink. Cool! After drinks and apps, we roamed the boat and had a great time. We did a bit of amateur ghost detecting but only caught a green orb.... Nice nighttime view across the water makes for cool pictures. Pretty cool place!",Elizabeth H
10,The Queen has seen better days,"I was excited to bring my teenager on board to see this once magnificent ship (which I had originally visited as a teen) ....sadly it is long past it's glory days. It smells old, looks forgotten, and whoever is the ""curator"" couldn't be less creative with the exhibits. The most interesting part of our day was watching the film reels in a small, stuffy and lifeless ""theater"". At least we were luckier than most because someone comped us a ticket so between the two of us it was only $30.00. None of the food venues were open (which might have been a good thing based on the reviews of the food and service I just read on TripAdvisor). Long Beach has lost a great opportunity for tourism by allowing the Queen Mary to fall to such low standards. If I were the city managers, I wouldn't advertise it as one of their main attractions. So sad to see this grand and historic ship lose it's luster.",Big Red
40,Fascinating,An interesting place to visit with lots of interesting history. Expensive and a lot of walking. Once was enough.,Judy F
20,Really Not Worth It,"We are a family of five and we were excited about visiting the Queen Mary and doing the Glory Days tour. The Glory Days are well and truly in the past. The Tour Leader, Bill is an officious man who barks out facts with no passion or interest in his voice and gives you the impression he just wants the tour over as quickly as possible. The ship itself looks impressive from the outside but we should have saved ourselves the $150 and not gone inside. Smelly, run down and a very sad state of disrepair and definitely not worth visiting!",GlobeTrotting606926
40,Cruising at a Standstill,I'm a cruiser so stepping on board from the ramp brought back memories. My son was staying there so the visit and walking tour was free. His room was more spacious than the inner cabin on the major lines I've cruised with. We took the free walking tour so you can see artifacts and photographs from the past including movie stars of that time.,Joseph C
40,A Stately Excursion,We were on a tour and had a buffet lunch onboard. The food selection was very good and the staff did a good job with such a large group. The wedge salad was especially good. After lunch we had a tour and our guide gave a great history lesson and answered many questions. We had some free time afterwards to wander by ourselves. If you have some free time this is a nice place to visit.,golftaxi
20,Can't sleep or shower,"The room would never get warm. Finally got them to get the a/c off at 3:00am, still couldn't sleep. Shower wouldn't get warm and had no pressure. No concern for ghosts, more concern about being able to sleep for $202 a night! They should have of compt the room, free meal or something. We even had to try and plug the air vent. This will be our last stay here.",Joe Howard
50,An art deco icon!,"Absolutely beautiful ship with so much history. There are a number of tours and exhibitions. You could spend hours here. Some of us opted for the history and architecture tour, which was funny, informative and allowed you access into all sorts of parts of the ship. The rest of our party did the ghost tour, which gave them a number of great stories! An absolutely gorgeous step back in time.",Natalie Y
30,Queen Mary Tour,"Overall we enjoyed learning about Queen Mary,how the great ships came to be, its history and famous passengers during peace and war. Our guide for famous haunting, Kelly, was excellent in sharing the stories to leave us with a chill and a few goose bumps when roaming each passage and room. However, the whole visit had distractions of poor signage on and off the ship, and lack of information about changes and cancellations of tours. We. Wound up not taking 2 tours that were supposed to be included in our package after we learned our tour time was changed after we boarded the ship. And, it was worse when we were asked for $20 for parking just as we were leaving the lot.There was no visible sign about parking fees when we entered a general parking lot. We only found out when there was Only one lane available to exit and a long line of cars. One woman was at the open gate to collect money. I think all the exiting visitors were surprised, since there was prolonged conversation as each car went through. We were asked for our hotel key or tickets when we got to the gate. We gave the woman our tickets and she asked how long we had been there and if we had eaten at a restaurant. We told her we arrived at 11:00a and it was now 3p. We were told it would be $20 for parking unless we had a receipt for eating on the ship. We hadn’t done that, so we paid the $20. We told the woman that we hadn’t seen or been given any information about parking fees or info that fees could be reduced if we dined on board. She seemed surprised, but didn’t tell us where that information was available for us. We recommended that she let her manager know the situation, so it would be a better experience for visitors and parking attendants.",lsaries
40,Queen Mary New Years Eve Hotel Stay and Party,"Came here again for New Years Eve and booked VIP tickets and a Stateroom and stayed in A174. The cost for the room and two VIP tickets came to about $750 with TAX and parking. This is actually a VERY reasonable price for anything in LA on NYE. We got there at 5:30 PM and there was a pretty long line for checking in BUT they really worked it fast and got us in faster than I thought possible so bravo there. The party was absolutely a blast. Several ballrooms to choose from and the staff were very helpful. The food was good and reasonably priced. Parking was simple and quick. Things I did not enjoy: They actually let people smoke on the ship on the decks outside. This was a surprise to me as I watched people smash their butts on the teak deck. It was also hard on the lungs and I was next to some guy smoking a cigar that probably cost $3. The heat in our room was not working. I am usually the guy who likes a frosty room at night, but this was even too cold for me. Between the smoke and the cold room I did wake up with a bit of a cough in my chest but we still managed to bundle up and I was able to fall asleep. If you go to their NYE party VIP is a must as you are limited to just a few rooms if you don't. Overall the party was much better then the one I came to 5 years ago but the room was not. I would still come again though. The fireworks show was EXCELLENT and made me smile like a kid again.",TheSexyBeast
20,Not What it Once Was,"We toured the Queen Mary almost 40 years ago. At that time, it was a wonderful experience. Time and management decisions have not been kind to this ship. Now, a majority of the area that was formerly part of the tour areas other than the engine room is closed as it has been re-purposed for private parties and weddings. Parking fees have gone sky high and the parking is quite a distance from the ship. Most of the close in parking has been turned over to cheesy high admission events. The condition of the ship itself is in steep decline. The carpets are extremely dirty, the once wonderful woodwork throughout the ship has been defaced by visiting vandals, and two of the four elevators on the ship are permanently out of commission. It was so, so sad to see this once proud ship in such a state.",Richard_PF_59
50,Amazing day,"We took the guided tour work a cruise officer. It was about an hour or so. It was incredible! The history of this ship is so interesting. The architecture of the ship and the original decorations are beautiful. I’d love to go back in the eve and do the haunted tour. I did t have any encounters while I was there, but maybe I will next time!",Kristi T
50,Awesome!,"The Queen Mary is very nice!! The views was awesome to catch a sunset. If you’re leaving out for a cruise, then you’ll want to stay here. It’s walking distance to the cruise terminal. There are several restaurants, shops, and a bar inside. They had plenty of holiday activities going on during our stay. The cabins are very spacious. The beds were comfortable. The customer service was great. They also have many tours and activities that you can do on the ship. There’s a theater inside too!",Vonetta W
50,STEP IN an ART DECO TREASURE and STUNNING VIEWS OF LONG BEACH,"The Art Deco you can find there is superb! This colossal, elegant ship has a Titanic flair, but it was bigger and faster than the Titanic. The 1,000-foot ship began her life in 1930 in Clyde, Scotland. Then New York, and her 516th and final voyage were to Long Beach December 9, 1967. It was bought for 3.43 million. It opened to the public in 1971!No need to pay the full entrance fee: follow my local tip: at the entrance, say you are going to the Observatory bar for a drink ...On the deck enjoy the stunning view of Long Beach that suddenly takes a Miami Feel, a reason why shows are filmed here pretending to be in Miami, like CSI Miami, Jane the Virgin...For the gourmet, try the Queen Mary Royal Sunday Champagne buffet. Decadent! Or wrap up a night with a classy dinner, (Downtown Abbey feel), and go to Sir Witson's restaurant (open Thursday to Sunday!). Their delicious classic is their Beef Wellington (vegetarians will find their bliss too)If you go with kids, don't miss the Lego Room where you can build legos and try to find the cat hidden in the Queen Mary Lego... we did!For the ones that like ghostly places, there are activities reported... when I taught French to one of the PR admin people, she said that often in their office, things were disappearing, cold, hot hair felt, and doors closing or opening for no reasons...To conclude a major historical fact: Churchill signed the D-Day declaration on the Queen Mary which saved the frogs and the rest of Europe from Fascism.",MissV
50,Nice attraction if you’re in long beach,Great historic ship. Enthusiastic tour guides! Could probably do most of the sights on the boat in half a day but recommend the haunted tour.,Melissa C
50,Beautiful nostalgic local—especially Christmas,"Was absolutely delightful, beautifully decorated for the Christmas season —highly recommend. There was a beautiful Christmas event wherein we could listen and enjoy. The breakfast in the Promenade was delicious.",XSNRG87
50,Crossing the ocean in luxury,"A marvellous window into relaxed travel in times past is shown here. A magnificent liner that we admired as we got closer along the scenic promenade.Prized artefacts such as passenger tickets add to the aura and history surrounding her voyages. Walking around the numerous decks it was great to see the richness of the décor.Beautiful wood effects, lighting and carpeted floors were the hallmarks. Another highlight was to visit the Promenade Café and dine on a delicious lunch therein.",permia
30,hotel stay,booked a suite for 4 days no heat they moved us toa smaller room still no heat fornt desk was helpfull but no heat so we just stayed on night an left and went to another hotel at least motel 6 has heat and they leave the light on for you.,dustin
50,Why didn't I dress in period appropriate clothing?,"I read all of the negative reviews and was prepared to be underwhelmed. This was the most fantastic stay I've probably had in my 57 years. I'd traveled back in time to a different era and every detail was perfect. I'm sorry, but when I got off the ship, I cried a little bit. I did not want to be in 2019. The staff was amazing. My room was retro and everything about my stay was perfect. When I laid on my back in my room and looked up at the light fixtures, I was at my grandmother's house. The details of this place... AMAZING. When I turned on my TV,there were black and white shows playing. And, when I walked down the halls, there was Christmas music from the 1940s. The night life is popping. I could not believe that all of this fun was to be had on this ship. I highly recommend it. Do not believe the negative reviews. Take your friends and enjoy your lives.",Denecia J
40,A preserved icon,"The Queen Mary Hotel is a must-do experience if you are interested in maritime history. This ex-Cunard ship floats in its own mini-harbour and allows guests to experience 1st-Class travel as it was in the 1930s and 40s, without moving anywhere. This Art-Deco classic retains much of the mystique of Trans-Atlantic travel of the day.Our cabin was spacious and comfortable, particularly the bed, and was paneled in timber. However, potential guests need to be aware that by current-day standards, the accommodation would not rate higher than 3-star.Disappointingly, the hotel management needs to pay closer attention to rubbish left lying around the decks (due to day-trippers?) and to maintenance of the ship, particularly severe rusting visible in some exterior fittings, such as life-boats.It was also very disappointing to have the historic tone of the vessel trampled by the presence of a Starbucks cafe on board!Guests should also be aware that the boiler-room tour (at cost) delivers huge empty caverns below decks, apparently due to the Cunard hand-over agreement that required the vessel to be stripped of its boilers and steam engines. While this consequence is understandable, it was nonetheless very disappointing to experience.",David B
10,Agonizing ship,"Very disappointed by the lack of things to see on the ship, for the price. Except for the reception area, for commercial purposes,almost everything is closed. No maintenance inside or outside.Much to expensive for nothing.",Michel A
10,Don't Stay here...Just Visit,I have made the mistake of staying here twice. The first time I stayed here we had the fire alarm go off at 4am and we all had to evacuate for about 20 mins. Could it be haunted...Maybe. The Second time I stayed here the fire alarm went off and 3:30am and we had to evacuate again. If your looking to have your sleep disturbed then by all means this is your place. However on that second stay I was there for a conference. When I went to take a shower there was no hot water. I went down to the lobby to ask if this would be fixed soon only to find 30 other people down there with the same issue. We were told that there was nothing they could do at this point. They had no idea when there would be hot water. I found them to be rude when dealing with the guests. I had to leave and go to another hotel to take a shower. If a hotel cant offer a good night sleep and a warm shower in the morning... should they be offering rooms?I will say that the ship is worth visiting and the tours are very nice. The history of it is very interesting. The bar has a cool atmosphere. I just don't recommend staying there unless your a ghost chaser or your looking to confirm that the fire alarm goes off every night.,Steph V
10,Don't stay unless you want to pay $70 for a salad and soup on the ship!,"Way overpriced for really basic food, no coffee in the rooms and they will not refund you when they cancel Dining with Spirits. No activities near the ship and had to spend a fortune on Lyft to and from the ship to have any dining and shopping experiences. Stay at another hotel, and just pay for the ghost tour. Won't visit again.",Christina C
30,Needs money spent,We nearly booked an overnight on the Queen Mary but the reviews and prices suggested it might be best avoided. Glad that we went elsewhere but the tour was essential to see this part of history. Lots to see and must have been majestic in its day but sad to see it as it is now. A lot of money is needed to improve the overall experience but with a lot of competition it is hard to see this happening.,Duquesadiner
30,Needs a little love,"We came here excited to stay on the famous haunted Queen Mary and I feel a little mixed after our visit.The ship as a whole is really cool and impressive in many regards (especially the first time you're standing on the outside of it). My mom was staying in a standard room which seemed to be a little smaller than a traditional hotel room, but otherwise seemed pretty nice. My wife and I had a suite, it was confusing and left a bit of a feeling of uncomfortability going to sleep. To elaborate a little more on that, the suite had rooms with no particular purpose, several bathrooms that were split into multiple sections, etc. It felt a little more like the Winchester house in design which doesn't feel great to sleep in. We're not really picky or overly critical of most places, but the rooms could really use some updating or revival. Beyond the sleeping situation, it definitely felt like a step back in time and it was great to get to explore the halls of the Queen Mary and enjoy the activities it had to offer.My recommendation would be to improve the check-in process since that took an abnormally long amount of time and to be a little clearer in directions for the events taking place on the Queen Mary. They're often not intuitive to find and the workers didn't seem to know where they were at either.",Robert Szklarz
30,Revisited the Queen Mary after 30 years.,"The guided tours are new, but the ship is quite old but interesting. Took my kids when they were young, 30 years ago. The lunch was better and the ship was in better condition. Back then you could also see the Spruce Goose. The guided tours are entertaining and are reasonably priced. It will take you about 4 hours to see the whole ship. The restaurant and bar are moderately priced, but except the history and vintage fixtures and photos the food and drinks are quite average.My wife is interested in booking for New Years, but based on the small rooms and new years eve prices,",prfecto
10,Worst Experience we have had traveling,"We usually stay at the Queen Mary when we leave for a cruise out of Long Beach. Our friends like the nostalgia so we usually over look the high price and the outdated amenities. We got there during an event called Haunted Harbor and didn’t think too much of it. We generally never get to worked up about anything and can work through it. We went out to dinner with our friends across the harbor and returned about 10:30. When we got into our room we clearly shared a wall with the haunted house and heard pipes being clanged together and screaming every 3 minutes. We were tired and the phones didn’t work in the room so we couldn’t call and complain. We also didn’t want to move rooms so late because we we leaving early in the morning for the cruise. The noise continued every 3 minutes until 2am and it was miserable.When we checked out we went to the front desk and told them of the horrible night without sleep. The front desk said “yes, that is a horrible room to be in” and explained that the hotel had called guests prior to arrival to tell them of the event. I told them I didn’t get the call and they made me feel like it was our fault for not getting the call. I explained it was hard for me to believe that they would tell us that we would be up till 2 am listening to screaming and banging every 3 min when a group went through. The staff reluctantly gave us our amenities charge back which was silly since we paid nearly $20 in amenities and didn’t even have WiFi or service for our phone.We travel a lot and this by far was the worst experience we have had. Please do not stay here, if only for there lack of empathy for an event they are making tons of money off and totally screwing the hotel customers.",AllieJosie1
40,Revisiting The Past,"I first visited the RMS Queen Mary as a young child in the 70's, ( they still had the Jaques Cousteau exhibition going,,,) and again as a young parent in the late 90's.My wife and I recent went as it was something I had wanted to do again after not having been for quite a long time.The tickets for the tours and the paranormal walk came to about 160.00..I hadnt really considered it to be too expensive and for a day of entertainment it seemed worth it.We arrived around 10:30 in the morning , did all of the tours and had lunch and dinner there and in general had a nice pleasant day.The tour guides were very helpful and provided great information about what we were seeing. Everyone on board, including the ticket office seemed very nice and helpful.The paranormal shipwalk, while an additional 52.00 per per person was really cool and very informative !There were many changes happening on board at the time, many areas were closed that in prior years had housed things like the Titanic artifacts and other exhibits that have now been removed ( hopefully to put something new and improved in ! ) and it was near the time that the hunted attraction/ spook alley was being taken down,Thats the good part....now the bad.It simply breaks my heart to see such a majestic ocean liner literally rotting away, nothing has been done to ensure that she will be around for very much longer, rust and corrosion is rampant, paint is peeling and I am hoping that part of what I was seeing going on was some restoration work. This is a beautiful ship and I feel it has not been very well taken care of, such a shame to rob the future of the gem of the past that she is. Please do something before it is too late or simply let her go. Sitting there rotting while squeezing every ounce of money out of her and doing nothing in return to preserve her is simply disgraceful. I strongly urge anyone that can visit her to do so now,she is a beautiful artifact with so much history, it would be a shame to just let her go.",Lama P
30,nice but a bit scruffy,"nice to stay for one night.Very dated which is to be expected but ,carpet,seating need a good overall.There is nothing else to see in this part of long beach so you have to get a shuttle into town ,as its oo far to walk.very expensive if you havent got a b and b deal.Breakfast $25 which is very good but over priced.",BreconEmily
30,Nice Place to Make an Historic Tour,"In this cruise ship you will have the experience to see the old construction styles of rooms, theatres, shops areas, etc.If you are lucky you may see the room where Winston Churchill, former president of England, stayed in one travel.It has shops and a restaurant. They have three tours, the historic tour, the haunted tour and the engine tour. Nice to spend a day learning from history.",Carmelo S
30,Old Girl needs some love,"Staying on the Queen Mary was supposed to be a highlight of our trip. I love maritime history and cruising and couldn’t wait to combine a bit of both!We booked a suite to make the most of it. We arrived a bit late so could not do a proper tour but had time to explore the ship on our own. I absolutely loved being on board although she is in desperate need of maintenance. They are trying to keep up with the wood rot, but decks are in very poor condition. I loved the original decor in the room. The heating didn’t work properly and we didn’t have hot water. We had read reviews and knew she was a bit run down but still really enjoyed it!",Gypsy Girl
30,It is ok,"It is an ok tour and something to visit if you are in Long Beach, I don't think it is worth a long drive to come here. It is a pretty Victorian style ship with some history but other than that there is nothing much to see. The ticket might be a little pricey too and the food is really expensive in my opinion.",F-F
50,"Next Halloween, Do the ""Lights On"" Tour!","We tried to book the Paranormal tour at the last minute, but it was sold out – but we wanted to see the Queen Mary before we left SoCal to return to Chicago – so we booked the “Lights on” tour without knowing anything about it. During the Halloween season, the Queen Mary has its Dark Harbor event on the weekends with 3 spooky mazes onboard the ship and 3 spooky mazes setup on the harbor. The Lights-On tour takes you “behind the scenes” (held during weeknights). The Dark Harbor weekend events are very popular, judging by the barricades that are in place for people that wait in line to get into the mazes.In our group, 8 pm on a Monday night, there were only 5 of us on the tour. Our guide, Chris Perley, was terrific. Even with a small group, he was enthusiastic and yet not “over the top”. He has a great booming voice, he’d be perfect for radio or voice-overs. Anyway, he was also super knowledgeable about the history of the ship and his enthusiasm was contagious. He took us through 2 of the mazes on the ship and one of the mazes on the harbor. Even with the “lights on”, it was still pretty dark and Chris used his flashlight for most of the mazes. The best part was that Chris gave us many tips and tricks (especially how to find the hidden bars) that we could use when we came back on the weekend during the actual Dark Harbor event.Hats off to Chris Perley and if you take this tour, make sure you ask if he is leading it!",Jwkruz
30,Did the self-tour.,"Following a Carnival Cruise we did a self-guided tour. We just walked from the cruise terminal to the Queen Mary. Admission was free by showing our Carnival Sail & Sign card, and various tours could be purchased for $10 each. We spent about 2 hours walking all about the ship. My husband especially liked being able to get into the engine room. While I'm sure the guided tours would have been interesting, there was a lot to see on our own. The ship is worn, at best--but it is old. Lots of steps although you can take an elevator to most of the places.",Edwardroy
40,Business trip to LA.,"On my second business trip to LA I chose to stay at The Queen Mary. I like old buildings and ships of course. The ship is old, a lot of beautiful wood finishes everywhere. This was definitely all I expected and more. The history of the ship is really interesting. Going here expecting all modern amenities you'll be disappointed. But if you like the old beautiful ships, then this is for you. The rooms are actually surprisingly large, with shower/bath in each one. Had dinner on board at the Chelsea Chowder restaurant, it was great! I would definitely go back and hopefully have some more time to explore LA.",AMA1963
50,A Long Beach MUST SEE,"I participated in several tours while staying in a first class room onboard.If you are going to stop and see the famous Cunard ship, it is best to do it all, and I did most of it.The glory days tour shows you some first class areas that are not open to the self guided walking tour. The guide was informative and shared some interesting history about the ship.The ghost tour takes you to some other areas including some of the second class areas not open to the self guided tour. Some of the salons were being used for private events and were no open for viewing and there were areas that were under restoration.The first class pool area was closed to the public and even the ghost hunt tour was not allowed in. That was disappointing. The ghost hunting tour starts at 10 and may extend four or more hours. That was the most exciting. Getting to explore areas that are normally locked and into the bowels of the ship was fascinating.After the guided tours I explored further with the self guided tour, exploring areas that interested me and getting some good photos. There is a lot of walking and staircases. Some areas are not level and the ship is floating so there may be a hint of movement. Be mindful when walking as not all the decks are level.The decor of the ship is magnificent. the craftsmanship, woodwork, and artwork is like walking through a floating gallery.The hotel and shop staff were helpful and friendly.The dining establishments I experienced, were far below first class standards yet still charges the first class prices",Deborah S-K
50,Would recommend this experience to all.,This is a historical floating hotel. It is dated and so don't expect everything to be perfect and updated. What a fantastic experience though! We will stay with them again. We went in October and so Dark Harbor was going on. Very crowded but a great time.,Bruce A
50,Historical and interesting,"I stayed a night on board the ship and while I agree that it needs some TLC, there did appear to be a fair amount of work going on outside when I was staying. The ship itself is great to wander around and get a taste of how sea travel used to be. On foggy mornings it's hard to remember it's actually permanently docked as thew view from the decks is spectacular and feels like you're in the middle of a misty ocean crossing.I also took the steam and steel tour which was fascinating as you see the bowels of the ship and get a feel of the complex mechanical systems which kept her going and the sheer size of the booler rooms will amaze you. Yeah, the ship has also become a kind of tacky ghost tour, but there is still a lot of her original charm left so at the very least a daytrip is a good call.I also ate at the chowder restaurant and the prominade cafe for breakfast. Both a little pricey, but not unexpected, however excellent meals and service both Times.",Fish_EDI
50,Dark Harbor Overnight,This is my favorite place to visit during the halloween season. The vibe is always so much fun and it’s always great to explore the ship after hours when everyone’s gone home after Dark Harbor. The rooms are spacious and there’s plenty of good food and the cocktails at the observation bar are amazing!,Anthony M
50,A Beautiful and Majestic Ship,"We visited the Queen Mary in Long Beach to tour the ship, have lunch, and enjoy the views of the Long Beach area.There is an admission and if you don't want an extensive tour then get the $40 ticket. It will basically allow you to roam around the decks and get to the restaurant to have lunch if you choose to do that. The ship is quite big and also has a hotel in it. We enjoyed it very much.",vin3281
30,In need of refurbushment,"Was looking forward to my visit as I had been here nearly 20 years ago.Was disappointed with the room.Cold and shabby. No tea/ coffee making facilities, not enough towels for us all.And NOT CHEAP AFTER ALL THE COST ADDITIONS.The ship being very close to our hearts as we are from Scotland , did not disappoint.Got talking to a very friendly young man who was in charge at the 4Dvideo presentation. He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.Great video also.DO NOT VISIT THE STARBUCKS,VERY EXPENSIVEALSO HAS A VERY RUDE, IMPATIENT MEMBER OF STAFF WORKING THERE!WILL NOT BE BACKBit of a disappointment for me...so sad.!",amacrae2
50,They don’t make them like they used to,"We booked a five night trip away on the Queen Mary including flights from the UK and got a great deal. After reading recent reviews I was just a bit concerned about what she maybe like but have come away after having one of the best weeks ever. We arrived at her early evening after a long flight and check in was very smooth. Our cabin was upgraded and we found our way there easily. The cabin was extremely clean and atmospheric, with the original bespoke furniture, it looked out to the dock side of Long Beach from the porthole. The bathroom was also so clean with a lot of original fittings. She is an old lady and carpets are taped up here and there but this didn’t bother us. There was plenty of room for the two of us. The walls as previous reviewers have said are quite thin, I took ear plugs with me, on two of the five nights I was awoken by neighbours watching the TV late into the night. Everyone on the ship was really friendly. We used the Starbucks on the promenade deck but didn’t eat in any of the restaurants. We enjoyed exploring the ship. Although we didn’t do any of the tours we attended the Halloween event Dark Harbour on our first night there, we only got to do two of the six mazes but both these took us into the bowels of the ship which was amazing to see. There’s free Long Beach transport to and from the ship called Passport, we used this every day to get us to Downtown. Thanks for a fantastic stay.",S1las
50,Wonderful elegant dinner,Such a perfect atmosphere and dinner. Definitely pricey but worth every penny and such fun walking around.,susie s
20,Interesting but overpriced,Very tired and needs lots of cleaning and restoration worn carpets. Dirty elevators and railings. Just needs lots of attention. Very disappointing.,MaryBeth P
10,"checkin was a joke "" I don't see the problem""","trying to get to the ship was a mess very poor organization to try to get checked in. what a mess, nobody wanted to help assist or direct guests from the on site festivities. what a mess and they were mis informed and negative about any information given out during checkin.",Jo Ann B
30,Sadly disappointing,"I was quite excited to visit the original Queen Mary and something I’ve being meaning to do for a while. The ship has an amazing history and the exhibitions around the vessel are well presented, interesting and interactive. We arrived early and did a self tour around the ship which was easy enough with the leaflet provided at the entrance booth.Despite the above I felt saddened by the overall state of the vessel and what it’s become. The bins around the ship were overflowing and there were ample glasses and rubbish laying around on the decks (I assume from the hotel side of the business?).Secondly I understand the vessel is over 80 years old, however it is in need of continuous and further restoration with decks rotting away and recent rust patches frequent, it would benefit from a month of closure to clean, repair and restore aspects of the ship to their original glory.The final point was the unexpected $20 parking fee to exit the car park in addition to the entrance fee (which isn’t cheap!).",biggyd
10,What a disappointment,"I was so looking forward to a night on the QM. But unfortunately it is being left to decay. So much work needs to be done it is frankly tatty. We had a lovely meal in the Sir Winston Restaurant which was genuinely good but the rest is compltely missable. On reading some background you realise that most of the old ship has been pulled out, very little remains. We were there at halloween and outside is the massive Dark Harbour Halloween festival. If you want sleep dont have a cabin on that side. And the ship is full of youngsters in fancy dress its like a 70s weekender at Skegvegas",Karenpon
40,One of a kind attraction,This look into the past was well worth our time. We stayed at the onboard hotel and were able to explore the ship over a two day period. The cost was less than a conventional hotel and allowed us the time to really see everything the ship has to offer. We are modern cruisers (usually on Seabourn) and are used to cruise ships and all they have to offer. This visit allowed us to see how cruising was in the 30's through the 60's. We throughly enjoyed our time aboard.,David S
40,Stepping Back into History,"My husband's father went overseas in WWII on the QM. He (husband) was informed of this as a child and wishes he'd questioned more about it as he matured. Seeing a documentary on it prompted me to make reservations. There is no doubt that the ship is old and many areas could use some work. But for anyone interested in history this was a great place to visit. Couldn't believe how spacious the first class stateroom was and how much attention was given to detail in the room Although the series of 4 knobs on the bathtub were inoperable the fact that back then you could choose hot, cold, sea or regular water was interesting. There were even buzzers by the shower/tub for help from either a steward or stewardess. The fact that there was also a sink in the bathroom and a sink outside as well surprised me. The beds were comfortable and the lighting gave nice ambiance. At the desk we were asked to sign that we would not be noisy. Upon entering our stateroom we could hear every word coming from next door. Back in the day the noise of the engines would have drowned this out but the ship is permanently docked so keep your volume under control.. This did not create a problem for us. Dining at Sir Winston's was memorable, but expensive. There were other options available so we never had to get off the ship to eat. We also had a very informative and educational tour that added up to a wonderful experience. Just a heads up, buy your bottled water from the gift shop and not the marketplace. Big difference in price.",mjwbnw
30,Great historical value but nothing else,On a recent trip to Long Beach I had an opportunity to visit the Queen Mary. It has plenty of history value lots to see with two hours. It was in its original condition just as it’s advertising’s however I didn’t like the antiquated smell and was happy we decided to visit the location and not sleep there.,leenylove
50,Enjoyable Stay and Tours Aboard an Iconic Ship,"In Long Beach for a business trip, and decided to stay on the QM for a night before traveling home. Rented a Deluxe King room and found it to be comfortable and spacious. Everything worked, but would not be consider it luxurious by modern luxury hotel standards. There are some modern updates like television, air conditioning, and electric outlets. The room had many of the original fixtures and fittings, including wood finishing, vanity, (non-working) original electric fan, and (non-working) taps for salt water in the bathtub. It's a testament to the build quality that an 85-year old vessel is still comfortable to stay aboard. I especially enjoyed opening and looking out the portholes in my room. I would stay again, but rent a more luxurious room such as a suite next time.While onboard, I took the time to do several daytime tours: glory days, steam and steel, and haunted encounters. All were good tours, and hotel guests get a small discount on a package of all three tours. All the tours do a reasonable job of showcasing parts of the ship that one cannot normally visit. Glory days was good, but did not visit some of the more elegant ballrooms because they were in use for private functions. Haunted encounters was good, but we could not visit inside the 1st class pool which would have been nice since it is not open to explore individually. The tour did not go through the isolation ward, another spooky part of the ship, but that can be explored individually. The steam and steel tour of the engineering spaces was excellent and seemed the most complete of the tours in terms of covering its topic. Overally, an enjoyable set of tours of the QM that were well worth the visit.",RoadLessTraveledx2
40,Unique Museum Experience Amid Comfortable Hotel Stay,"Great value for proximity to the Long Beach Convention Center, even with the surprise $25/night to park and about the same in additional fees. The quality and vibe reminds me of the Raffaello in Chicago or the New Yorker in Manhattan. It ain't new, and something's bound to be askew. On the Queen Mary, the real charm is found outside the room. Art Deco Paradiso with ideal SoCal fall weather on deck. Great for strolling at night amid drinks and dinner and running cement stairs in the early AM with nary a soul in sight. There's just enough preserved authenticity to make an evening on board worth the inflated cost of dining and drinks. Professional bartender works the Promenade bar. Staff at Sir Winston's also cosmopolitan.",Joe
50,Amazing little piece of history!,We really enjoyed seeing the ship. The wood planking on the deck and all the intricate wood detail on the walls and stairways was amazing to think how fancy this must have been for its time. It looks just like you'd imagine an antique luxury cruise ship would look. I'm sure it must be used in movies! We ate at Sir Winston's and the food and service was fantastic. The best thing was a lavender martini...oh my goodness!!,264BeachFam
30,"Beautiful ship, but...","We were excited to see the Queen Mary, given its historic status and reputation. Unfortunately some areas rather let the visit down. The areas that you can visit are fantastic; the engine room and isolation ward being particular highlights. Unfortunately the ship has been extensively remodelled over the years, and lots of areas are lost and/or inaccessible to the ordinary visitor. It would have been great to see various classes of cabins for example, and also have access to the swimming pool and first, second and third class recreation rooms and lounges.Overall, the visit was enjoyable, but could have been improved with more areas being open to view. It’s also deeply disconcerting to see a Starbucks plonked in the centre of a “historic monument”- this seems a wholly unnecessary addition to a beautiful structure.Can’t really recommend the café either- food was expensive and average in a rather run-down setting.",Andrew Graham
30,It was a novelty but that's about it.,It's a gorgeous ship that I booked a night in the ship with my girlfriend. It had a lot to see but that's about it. It was expensive and there were a lot of taxes and fees that came along with the stay that made the stay more expensive than it should have been. I recommend this place for the novelty for a night but not long than that.,Peter N
30,Queen Mary Hotel Long Beach,"An interesting experience, with the opportunity to use a cabin on this famous ship.Although I booked a superior king cabin, at the price paid, i would have expected all the lights to work and not to find the cooling control hanging off the wall.The a/c could not be controlled and the room was far too cold.The dining experience in the Chelsea Chowder restaurant was not a very pleasant experience; a table was booked for 2000, but still had to wait for 15 minutes for the table and the resatuant was not busy. The service was so poor that I did not leave a tip (first time i had poor service in California)",Paul D
10,Queen Mary Hotel Stay,"Room was nothing like the picture. Better to stay at a hotel that is newer near QM. The room was not worth the $$$ parking is 25.00 per night. The toilet barley flushed. Bathroom smelled like mildew, also the bath tub was very small. The Queen bed was so uncomfortable and had stains. We had to find the comforter to the bed that was in the closet, we practically made the bed ourselves that was a total inconvenience as we just wanted to relax and decompress upon arrival.The bed had sheets on it that's about it our room did not have a flat screen and the pillows were so uncomfortable we couldn't use them. The QM hotel is not worth your money it's a rip off! The only positives were the tour and attractions the ship is full of history which was satisfying. I just read an article that stated QM is falling apart and is dangerous and needs millions in repairs. Do your research beforehand. Btw they don't offer anything complimentary except ice! water is $2.00. Also every restaurant meal is highly expensive. Advice bring your own bottled water and snacks especially if you have children with you.",Quintana661
40,Great experience,"We booked on 3 of the tours but didn't do the ghost one. The first tour was the glory days of the liner. Our guide was so unusual but informative and funny. Fabulous experience. The 2nd was a tour of engine, boilers, structure and prop. Disappointed that a lot had been removed but seeing the prop was amazing. You are 25 feet under the water line on the tour. A spooky experience. Well worth $100 for the two of us. My only gripe is that the grand old lady of the seas needs some tlc.",suwilly666
50,Just Wonderful!!,"We booked online and did the History of and Haunted tours included in the basic ticket and loved it! The ship is restored to her former cruising glory having been used during WW2. The ship is beautiful and is a slice of British history, how anyone could not enjoy visiting here is beyond me! The guides were excellent and you can tell how much they love their job and the ship. We used the Passport free bus to get here and then back to the bus stop back to the Metro bus back into the city.",whitbyabi
30,Okay experience,"This trip was okay. Nothing amazing about the trip. It was historic and my visiting family enjoyed the ship for its historic component. In hindsight, the best part of the experience was getting my tickets on Groupon and paying $20 versus $40 at the counter.",Dash7372
30,Slightly disappointed,We did not take any of the tours only self guided. We really did not see anything real amazing besides maybe the engine room. 4D movies were interesting. First time experiencing 4D. Drinks very expensive in the lounge. Nothing was very well maintained.,Michele R
40,Queen Mary Tours,"Two of us wanted to take the tours offered inside the Queen Mary ship. The woman that was at the parking level selling the tickets was not very patient about the questions we asked regarding the tours. At one point she interrupted my question and said in a very snappy voice, “WELL, do you want these tours or not????” We were trying to figure out the timing of the 3 tours so that we could still get lunch and do some shopping in the gift shops. She was so rude and didn’t need to be!The tour guides were awesome! They knew information about the areas they showed us, and were friendly and considerate of those who walked slowly. The tours were amazing (but check out my other review of the Promenade Cafe, as that I cannot recommend).",Linenminnesota
30,Rather disapointing,We visited as part of a group. We saw all of the areas about Churchill and World War II. The rest of the ship is a hotel so you can't see the staterooms or see the rest of the ship which I found very disappointing.,Susan3181959
50,"Cool spot to absorb some history, grab a drink and enjoy Long Beach","We visited for dinner and to take a self-guided tour of this beautiful ship. I loved being able to walk around and explore the decks and the interior. There is a bar on the rear end of the ship, with a beautiful mural and vintage decor... really cute. Definitely a unique spot to visit in Long Beach.",Tricia
10,Defeated,"Reservations made in advance said there is a refrigerator in the room, controlled climate, and free parking. Checking in, there is no free parking, it is $25 to park your own car, or a $30 fee for valet. The rooms are “ hot” when I asked the front dest about the heat she stated “it is all controlled by one unit, if someone complains of the heat, the air is turned on, and vise versa, if someone complains of cold, the air is turned off. Therefore you may have to call us several times to get the air on, that’s just the way it is”. There was no fridge for my meds as I was told, so they had to bring a fridge up. By this time all was a lie and the extra hidden fees were coming from all angles.We went on a tour and took the bus to dinner and shopping, that was nice and there are several motel/hotel options out there. Absolutely will no be a next-time, but I’d suggest staying the night anywhere other than this dilapidated boat.When we came back we were going to shower and go out to look at all the awesome views. Tubs are shaped like 1/2 pipes and very easy to fall, yes, I did fall right out of the shower. By this time I sat and just cried, it was hot, I had called several times to the front for accommodations they clearly should have had......... I went to get ice for a cold glass of water and watch tv, no ice, no vending machines worked, tried card, change and cash. Called again to front desk, she said “ we don’t have room service, you’ll have to find some machines that do work, they are by the exit signs. OK, so finally got a sprite and ice............ came back to room and now.............the tv won’t work............ called front again 21/2 hrs later he (maintenance) came to say, “this will need to be repaired, I’ll have to tell them to care of that tomorrow”.ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS TRIP WAS AWFUL. I left completely defeated",Tamz
50,Ghost Tour of the ship,"This was a fun suggestion for family entertainment. There were ten of us. The ticket is 40.00 per adult, but if you have a AAA Card you save four dollars per person. Super.We had about 1.5 hours to wait for the tour, but that was fine. So much to do. Your tickets include access to the ship, its historical exhibits, the great bar with excellent service.It also includes a 4D movie which was about 20 minutes long called ""Sharks"". Very fun.The ghost tour itself was so-so as these tours go. All of the documented sightings seem to have been by a single person so really.... who knows? But, its a great way to spend an afternoon, and you can say you have seen the Queen Mary!One last thought... this is not a tour for young children. Our youngest was 10. She did fine. Those who brought 3,5, and yes, infants were not doing so well (and neither were the other guests when these age group children started to cry, complain, etc).",SirenaDives
50,Living the dream,"I am sure many reviews mention the history and how one can imagine how it must have felt in early days of the ships journeys. But it is impossible not to get swept up by the atmosphere and embience. With that said we have experienced fabulous service from check in, the concierge, 3 restaurants and bars. All the staff are great. Had an awesome sleep in room M143. Meal in winstons was outrageously good. Porterhouse steak and the grueyre onion soup are so so good. Amazing cocktails in the observation bar. I could go on but just WOW.",travelchap101
40,Great Value,"Decided to visit the Queen Mary while on a trip to LA. It's easy to drive to with great signage. Parking fees are reasonable and there is a lot of parking available. Entry fees are $40.00 per person that gives you access to all seven tours. Military families get a $10.00 reduction in fees. You can do any of the tours you want to see, just schedule them on the Promenade Deck. You can also do a self guided tour and just wander around the ship. We saw many families aboard to its family friendly. There a spectacular vies of downtown Long Beach so bring your camera.",John H
30,Need to do tour,"Not much to see from the outside so if you visit you need to do a tour. Look online for tickets/discounts. This is a paylot, might get parking or discount included with ticket. Nice bygone age tour. Interseting to see old times cruise ship. Part is referbed for dinner/entertainment. Some companies hold conferences.meeting on board.",David R
50,Fun visit,"What a great place for a business meeting. The QM is totally self contained with great restaurants, amazing views, awesome history and the rooms are amazing. Stay a night or two and it almost feels like a cruise.",Chris D
50,A MUST SEE,"First off, I am a Ocean Liner buff and I LOVED it. I took a Lyft to the ship from the Hyatt Regency. Parking is a nightmare, but that's another story.The tours are really neat and I wound up doing 2 of them and then some exploring on my own. Spent about 5 hours on board the ship that day. I ate at one of the restaurant onboard, but don't remember with one. The food was good, no complaints. I didn't stay on board, but want to come back and do so.I can't understand the griping about it, but the ship is a artifact and yes, she was built in the 1930's and you will never get that kind of opulence anymore. Today's 'cruise' ships are too plastic and too big and will never be what the Queen Mary was.",gmcp3251
50,Nostalgia,"Wow, we stayed here for 2 nights and probably didn't see the whole ship. I felt like Rose on the Titanic! What a great place that puts you back in time. I loved it! Rooms were small but then again, you are on a ship.",Diane G
50,Question,Can we just stop in to visit giftshops? And is handicap parking ok planning a trip soon would love to visit,LoveTravel641544
20,Parking Nightmare and Tired Ship,"Spent one night here before sending our son off to summer camp in Catalina (the camp boat leaves from the same area where The Queen Mary is docked). There was a music festival going on in the same parking lot and it took us 20 minutes just to get into the parking facility. Had to park pretty far and carry our luggage thru a crowd of people to get to the hotel/boat. There are several music festivals in the Queen Mary Parking lot throughout the summer and it is an absolute nightmare trying to either get to the hotel. Absolute chaos! Somehow they think it is ok to have people checking into a hotel, 100s of kids leaving or returning from camp AND a music festival all going on in the same lot. And then they think it is appropriate to charge you $25 for overnight parking. They should have paid me for putting up with their hellish parking.The boat itself could be really cool,but there is chipping pain everywhere and wood that is splintered and in need up repair. It is sad because the historic value of the ship will be lost without some kind of maintenance.",Chantal D
30,"Beautiful to tour it, but as a hotel, well, not such a great experience. You must remember, it's a very old ship.","The cabins have some <cough> issues. The toilet flushing system still makes me laugh out loud. And it takes 30 minutes to get to water to take a shower. The bathtub itself is so curvy you have about 5"" wide to stand flat. Dangerous. There's no a/c, you must just open the portholes. No in-room coffee, 2 electrical outlets in the entire suite. Bed was fine, but... Just take a tour and stay elsewhere.",Okemosian
30,Paranormal tour on the Queen Mary,"My husband and I took part of the ""paranormal tour"" on the Queen Mary.It was a big group and a lot of walking throughout the entire ship. The ship is really quite large and we did not only walk the entire length of it several times through hallways but also went deep down in the belly of the ship. About 24 feet below sea level, which might not be for everybody.The tour was not creepy in any way but more of a historic tour, focused on who died where and why.For me the most eery place was in the engine room (below sea level) at night. I heard something there that was not supposed to be there and when I asked the tour guide about it, she said she had heard it once before as well but there is no logical explanation for it. So I guess this was my only paranormal experience on the tour.I would recommend good walking shoes, you will walk a few miles and water. Certain locations were very stuffy and hot.Was it the best paranormal tour I ever took? Maybe not but it was interesting nevertheless.",Indra110
30,"A must see, but being allowed to show her age","We love visiting the Queen Mary and we were even married on her several years ago. We revisited and were dismayed to see that she hasn't been maintained as well as she deserves. The Queen Mary is still a delight to see and marvel at the artistry that went into her. She truly is a beauty and a time capsule going back to a more elegant time.There are all sorts of tours. See the engine room. Learn about her important role in WWII. These are well worth doing. But I ask the people who own her and are making money off of the Queen to bring her back to her former glory. Paint is peeling in places, wood in areas is unfinished, the beautiful wood decks looked uncared for, the chairs in the Observation Bar are ripped and torn. Please preserve this beauty.",Bill G
50,So cool!,Loved learning about all the history. Looking through the window and seeing the old pool was my favorite part. My 9 and 7 year old went with me on the haunted tour. It was very entertaining but my nine year old did get a little spooked towards the end.,HappyJana
30,Historic ship,"This ship is a piece of history. The common areas and bars are very comfortable with a classic theme. The rooms however are small. They are clean but a tad worn. The location is too far from the downtown area to walk. Still, if history interests you- sleeping the night on a famous historical ship is cool.",Gordon Collier
50,Go visit this ship,"If you have any interest in old ocean liners, then this is a must ship to visit. There just aren’t any 1930’s ships of this sort remaining, so it is great to see what was once the largest, fastest, and beautiful pre world war 2 passenger ships. It still has .much of it’s beautiful woodwork as installed after the war. The exterior could use some maintenance, especially paint and varnish, but you can still appreciate how beautiful this ship once was. Take a tour of the ship, visit the bridge and engine room",Ric B
30,Why is the ship still here?,"Why would his not be replaced with a ship of American history. Decades ago it was a luxury ocean liner. I toured it with a client. We saw the small rooms people lived in decades ago, before most changed to travelling by air b",InnaYYZ
50,Ghost walk and lunch,"The Queen Mary is massive! It’s hard to take it all in, take your time! Take my advice and do the one hour haunted history tour, very worthwhile. Not scary at all but a great way to get some history about the ship. Stick around for lunch in the cafe. They served an amazing broiler chicken salad.",BethMorrison6
50,Very elegant,"What a cool ship, I told but well updated. Walking around the ship is a great way to look an history. The rooms are small but that’s the way they were back in the dayYou must have there brunch it pricey but well worth it They have everything you can want at a brunch and more, salads seafood and breakfast items It’s in the ballroom and it very elegant",Gary P
30,Win-Lose,"This isn’t a fair way to review this place. It should ask rooms, cleanliness, comfort, etc. like Expedia. But the attractions are nice, the ship is beautiful. The food is yummy. The gift shop is actually affordable. And the history is amazing. I enjoyed the tours. But we could not stay in our hotel room. I ordered the Queen Mary Suite. Top of the line. The room was nice overall to appearances. There is no AC. The little AC in the room doesn’t help. The heat is exhausting. It was no joke equivalent to a sauna. I even tried pretending it was one, to allow myself to feel better about the heat. I really wanted to stay with all my heart. My grandparents sailed to America on this ship. So it was important to me. But we couldn’t last. We checked in at 4 pm and out at 530 pm. We tried taking a shower to help, but the shower had no temperature control. It was always too hot or too cold. We could not get it right.I’d like to say the front desk people were very rude. They were snippy, bossy, cut you off before you finished talking, etc. They also were treating another guest poorly right in front of us. She had to change her reservation and they were not helpful. It angered them she had poor English. The other staff, such as tour guides and restaurant staff, were sweet.Lastly, I’d like to mention that we had accidentally left some of our belongings behind. The staff gathered it and we picked it up. But my ring from Turkey was missing. Figures. It was gold and had diamonds and an agate stone. So be careful with your stuff. Lock your valuables in your suitcases if you leave.",dogmama89
20,can't get the tours right,"We had to return 3 times just to get the tour right.From home, we called ahead and asked about the tour we wanted. We specifically wanted to see a specific room, and booked the Haunted tour when the desk clerk on the phone verified that room was part of the Haunted Tour. At the end of the Haunted Tour, the tour guide says ""Ok, that's all""...and we were shocked.(side note, the pool was on lock-down and not part of the tour).We had to return to the desk and they said we could see the room on our own tour, but it closed at 5 p.m. so we had to return tomorrow. So we had to get a manager to sign our ticket/form to be able to return the next day and see the room ourselves.We came back the next day, but couldn't see that room, because it's on a specific tour call the Steam/Engine tour. Then we had to get another manager, who had to call to get tickets scheduled for that. It was in a couple hours in the future, so we had to leave and return again.Warning...even with preparation, things on this ship can go awry.Not impressed with the Queen Mary.",WalkingInLA
50,Tour the steam & engine rooms,"We loved our afternoon running around this ship. What a gem. I am glad there are pictures all over of the many famous people who cruised on the ship. Great gift shops. Excellent tour by our guide, Tristan. Do not miss the 4-D movie. It’s a video of the history of the ship that you can’t see anywhere else.",Kelly M
30,Tired,"Though we saw and learned some interesting things, the overall impression we had was that this place is tired. The parking and ticketing areas, the waiting areas, the restrooms, even the staff. It all seemed like it’s past its prime. And it was very expensive....$144 for the four of us, even with a AAA discount, to see a short movie, wander around a few displays, and go on a guided tour that was less than an hour in duration.",cljcullen
50,Everything haunted,"We took the haunted tour of the ship. Scott was our guide and did an outstanding job. Kept our interest throughout the tour. Even scared me once or twice. I highly recommend this one. Queen Mary has some incredible history, scary and otherwise.",Doug H
30,An interesting experience,"Enjoyed my stay but was marred by a few issues, the first being the paper thin walls between rooms, my first night I got to listen to the neighbours TV despite wearing earplugs. The second issue was that I had no control over the air conditioning, the dial on the wall did nothing so some days/nights no air was coming out, other nights I felt like I was on the Titanic being blasted by freezing air I couldn't turn off. Thankfully there were extra blankets in the room.",Colin L
20,Meh,"Incredibly expensive for just meh. We expected some history and stories to accompany this tour- being that it was double the price of basic ghost tour. Not so. Ended up cutting the tour short after 4 HOURS and not even reaching the final investigation site - of which I was most interested in - but we just had to tap out after 3am. Not due to abundant activity however... none. Nothing. Boring. Snippets of stories and a couple of previous audio recordings, barely any viable equipment. The coolest part was visiting the boiler room. $200 could have been used elsewhere. Very disappointing. It was recommended we go back and listen to all recorded audio on our own and listen for whispers.... as if we wanted to REVISIT that 4 hours AGAIN!",SJS072270
50,Glory Days Tour - Enthusiastic Tour Guide,"While staying on the boat (see my review of the hotel as well), colleagues and I took the Glory Days tour with Paul. It was very obvious that he loves his job and the ship. He is very knowledgeable and shared so much information that I could not absorb it all.The ship is well kept for her age and I really enjoyed seeing how she is currently used. What a great thing the city has done in bringing her to Long Beach 51 years ago!",Julie M
50,ghost tours with a Keanu Reeves look alike!,"We had a wonderful time aboard the Queen Mary. We had lunch before going on our ghost tour. The guide was really funny and informative and people really thought he was Keanu Reeves in disguise. We didn't see any ghosts, but hearing the stories and seeing the old fashioned rooms made the tour special.",eileen c
50,Guided tours,"Took a haunted tour and a history tour. Both were enjoyable. It’s a massive ship. Lots of art, a movie, and walk all over the ship. It is a hotel too.",Rita T
50,"4th of July, 2019","July 9, 2019: We spent the day with our grandson at the Queen Mary, on the 4th of July. We decided to spend the entire day there. We arrived by 11a. We took the History Tour (Awesome) the Steam Room Tour (Awesome) watched the 4D movie about the Queen Mary and experienced a ""ride"" (Awesome); tried doing ""Line Dancing""; did Arts and Crafts (very nice people in charge and fun project that our 5 year old could do) Watched the Talent Show, took our grandson to the Kids Zone and saw the Lego Queen Mary (our Grandson enjoyed playing with the Legos.) He enjoyed the balloon man! We had a blast ! He got to see and touch a turtle, see a falcon, a Boa and other snakes. We watched a juggler and a Magic man. We did so much more than this, I can't name them all-- but I have to say I highly recommend this. It did get very crowded at 3P; and then it was hard to get around the ship. Our friends joined us at 4P and the Fireworks show was fabulous. We had a great day, ate great food, listened to 40's- 50's bands and Barbershop quartet and on and on! Our favorite was the Piano duet. We stayed after the Fireworks to watch their show. Grandson brought home several balloons; he is still enjoying! I highly recommend going!!Request: Dear Queen Mary. I am 63 y.o. And I work out so I could do the stairs; (but preferred the elevator when one was available and working) We needed a place to sit down and rest. There simply was not enough seating for the elderly and that crowd. That is why I have to make rating 4 1/2 stars. But, Nearly 5.",lavonneco
40,Recommended,"Impressive, if not a bit odd, to see the English Queen in California. A tour aboard the Queen leaves the visitor impressed and learning about a critical period of history. Recommnded attaraction.",Dana Los Angeles
50,So amazing!,"It was so amazing to be able to experience a ship like this that has so much history. I took the Haunted Encounter and the engine room tour. Both were so awesome. Tour guides were knowledgeable and everyone was super friendly. The food in the Promenade cafe was superior, with a beautiful view. I enjoyed every minute and wish I could've stayed longer. Highly recommend!!!",Sheri B
40,Historical Boat Tour On The Queen Mary,It seemed a bit disorganized to get the tour started but it ended up being very informative and a lot of fun. We stayed and took in the movie at the end. It also allowed up to walk the front part of hidden areas of the ship and they showed an old part of the rotor that was very interesting to. Staff was polite We did not sleep on the boat only visited for the day. We did get drinks and snacks at the Marketplace. Pricey but its a hotel,Hialeah73
50,Queen Mary,"I was a passenger on The Queen Mary in 1965 as a 6 year old child so had a fantastic trip down memory lane when we did a day visit on the ship at Long Beach.Firstly, I was surprised how huge it was for it’s day at 81,000 tons, it wouldn’t look out of place alongside some of the liners of today.I was prepared from the reviews for it to look shabby, but for her age she looked great.The observation bar, Piccadilly Circus shops, the playroom, the pursers desk, the bridge and the officers cabins and uniforms were great to see, shame there weren’t more public areas recreated to make it a more interesting tourist attraction.Great to see the wonderful wood panelling (some types now extinct) still intact throughout the ship.The deck area was exactly as I remembered it, though it would have been nice to see the steamer chairs and deck games still there.We also did the History tour and tour of the engine rooms which was very interesting.The 3D Queen Mary film was also good.Starbucks coffee was a welcome treat and parking was quick easy and near to the ship.",Janie E
50,Glory Days Tour,This was our first time taking a tour on the Queen Mary and it did not dissapoint. Being architecture and history buffs we decided to take the Glory Days tour. This tour gave us a wonderful overview of the history of the ship and the many interesting historical events that took place on the ship as well as the historical figures that participated in those events. This tour also highlights the laundry list of celebrities who graced the decks of this beautiful ship. If you appreciate architecture you'll appreciate this tour as it points out the Art Decco stylings that run throughout the ship. There will be plenty of stairs and walking but it will be worth it.,Art
50,Reminiscences of bygone day,"The free enterprise spirit of the United States is well represented by the metamorphosis of Queen Mary in Long Beach. I remember as a child that this big ship had been mentioned as the longest at that time. I might even recall its call of the Port of Haifa, my home town, in the sixties. I really enjoyed seeing this dinosaur again.",Eliezer R
40,Tours are a must!,We recently visited the Queen Mary during our stay in Long Beach...it was really fun! We arrived about noon...and we were hungry so we decided to have brunch/lunch. I usually have fairly low expectations for food at a tourist attraction however this food was really quite good...to my surprise! We were scheduled for 2 tours. The Haunted Encounters Tour was fun...our Guide told stories of 'happenings' and I loved to see the beautiful Art Deco decor. Make sure you see the Bar! I wasn't sure about the Steam and Steel Tour...but it turned out to be a delightful surprise! The 'belly of the beast' was huge...and interesting to see what was actually running this amazing ship. I definitely recommend going and taking the tours.,Suzanne
30,this is a grand old lady slowly losing her luster,the owners are not keeping this up. it looks like repainting in progress. the outside restroom is right up there with a porta potty. Los of stairs and very confusing to get out.the best exhibit was the ship models.,Cynthia U
20,An old attraction,Didn’t really care about this attraction. The lady at the ticket booth wasn’t friendly at all she got upset because I asked her to repeat the tours they offer but we at least got to experience it. We decided not to hang around for our tour but being inside the ship definitely gives goosebumps,Jorge V
30,Excellent Adventure/Horrid Night,"#1. Lesson learned. Do not use a booking site. Rooms were $80 cheaper the morning of our visit, but neither hotel nor booking site would honor price matching.#2. Check-in stated as 4pm. We were early - no problem. We had lunch and roamed the ship! She is gorgeous and we loved everthing about this part of our adventure.#3. By 6pm we were begging for a room --- finally! It was lovely. Totally amazing step back in time. The bathroom fixtures were so interesting!We ventured out and about the ship again, had dinner and then thought we would get an ice cream and coffee.The market place closes at 6PM!!! Crazy! Why? We got a snack and coffee at one of the bars.#4. Back in our room getting ready for a restful evening. The rooms are definitely NOT sound proof. We were sandwiched between two families who were there to party! At 3am my husband opened our door and just stared at the ones to our right. The kids in the ones to our left kept opening and shutting closet doors - LOUD! It was not a restful night. Ask for the quietest room on board.#5. Thankful this is in the ""bucket"". Will not repeat this adventure.",elderoffive

50,More than I expected,"The Queen Mary was a must see for us, and it offered so much more than I expected, that we spent quite a few hours there.First was the World War Tour explaining the part the Mary had in it. Then there was the 4D cinema which splashed water at you when the waves came up. There was also a Churchill exhibition, one could visit the bridge and go down below. In fact nearly every part of the ship was available to see, as well as side exhibitions, including how one produced food during the war, put on by the W.I.Most attractions had someone willing to explain things to you, and all were very friendly.One of the best attractions I have been too. Well done to all!",janetG2239JY
50,Awesome tour!,We took the tours and enjoyed them tremendously. Both tour guides were very knowledgeable and friendly.,Poppy
30,Neat to see,It's a big piece of history that is amazing to see up close. Very neat to explore on board the ship to see what it would have been like to travel so long ago. I enjoyed some of the photos and history of those who set sail on board. However - admission is quite expensive for what you actually get.,AshleyW3
40,Included in the Go Card,"We chose Queen Mary as one of the activities from our Go Card. It was well worth the drive from Hollywood.The ship is both a hotel and a tourist attraction with dining, a little bit of shopping and guided tours. We chose the tour that depicts the glamorous era. Our tour guide was very friendly and service minded and the tour was interesting. We were shown some areas of the ship that were exclusive to first class passengers. What I lacked from the tour was a look into living quarters for the different passenger classes.I believe the ship is best experienced with a guided tour but there’s plenty of things to look at even if you’re on a tight budget. They have an exhibit of miniature passenger ships that I enjoyed. I would have wanted more statistics about the different ships though.We also watched a 20 minute film in the 4D-theater. Unfortunately it was a repetition of what we had learned on the tour. But I do believe they show different films at different hours. The film was enhanced with soap bubbles, vibrations and a rather sharp poke in the back. If you have health issues, be sure to read the health information before you enter.",Helena Ö
10,Extremely Disappointing,"Staying on the Queen Mary has been on my bucket list since I first visited, about three years ago. I love it's charm & history! However, the hotel room was filthy and worn out. Upon arrival to our stateroom, we were automatically overwhelmed by the smell of dust, then disappointed at the 1970s beat-up furniture. A quick glance around the room showed that the room had not been touched in months and a thick layer of dust covered everything.We expressed our concerns to the front desk attendant (Bre) and asked her to move us. She basically said ""too bad so sad, you're in one of the largest categories of staterooms and all the rooms in that category are booked, but we can move you to the next largest category for $100 extra per night, or I can send housekeeping to clean your current room."" WE HAD JUST CHECKED IN...and her solution was to send ineffective housekeeping to our room AGAIN. I asked her if she had seen the condition of the room and requested that we be placed in a room that resembled more of what they advertise on the website. Bre said ""we have no control over the photos they put on the website, all the rooms in this category look alike and we can't visit all the rooms"". After much debate, she agreed to move us to a room with ""THREE single beds"". Once we arrived in the second stateroom it became obvious what she meant was ""TWO single beds and a ROLLAWAY cot"". We wasted hours trying to resolve the issue with the initial room, and then spent $267 to sleep on a rollaway cot in a semi-dirty room. We canceled the second night's reservation and stayed at a generic Best Western that was at least CLEAN.It's a shame to see such a beautiful historic treasure being neglected!",Wendy M
40,Spend the night on The Queen Mary oceanliner,Want to get historical and spend the night on The Queen Mary oceanliner? We really enjoyed our stay on the ship. Make sure you plan about 1 1/2 days to tour the ship and do the organized tours of the ship. Plan to eat on board as the food is very good at the two restaurants we ate at (Promenade and Chelsea's Chowder House. We stayed in a Junior Suite (2 rooms and bath).,sandramerwin
40,Review other scaled model ships and Glory Days,"When I boarded this ship I was thinking this is going to be a waste of time and money. Well, I was wrong. Go to the Promenade Deck to the Tour center where you can get all your questions answered. I would recommend doing the glory days tour first. Ten on A Deck elevator level 3 to get the Cunard Story and Staterooms, the hotel lobby is on this level. l preceded to view the Engine room which was impressive. I had never seen a propeller so massively large. Electric motors and steam generators were just my kind of stuff to see. Check out the Wheelhouse and Ship model gallery. There is the Hunted House encounters, but I didn't do that,",Leroy W
50,HISTORIC SHIP,"We visited the ship and did The Glory Days Tour - tour and history about of ship. It was quite informative and took us into areas unable to be visited on our own. The tour guide was good and entertaining while providing lots of information. We thought we'd be in and out in an hour and had to rush out after 3 hours with still more to see, so plan accordingly. Be aware that tours are timed, so you may have to wait, but there are restaurants and things to see while you wait. Look at the combined ticket with the USS Iowa that's about 15 minutes away for great savings!",jknechtly
40,It’s a historic ship worth exploring on your own .,"We just walked around and read the descriptions .We haven’t taken any offered tours.It is a hotel now but definitely shows it’s age and it seems that not much is invested in its appearance, the paint is peeling off on the exterior and it really needs some refurbishing.",ParadiseLoverNY
20,Not good for an overnight stay.,"The ship is listing and all the floors are not level. They charged unexpected occupancy and facilities fees(facilities which we did not need or use). They charged for self parking. Really ??? I parked my own car 40 steps from the front door and they charged me for it ??? Come on stop the nonsense !!! Since we had these 3 extra expenses for $53.23., we did not go on any of the tours.",BrasilTraveler
10,$40 to get in. Did not go toward any spending,I had to pay $80 just to get in before 6 pm. Drinks are very expensive and the beer selection was very bad. Never again,Sam A
40,"What a great Ocean Liner, still sitting proud","Was out walking early one morning when I saw the three red stacks in the distance, beyond all the many boats in the marina.Thought that has to be the famous Queen Mary and sure enough on getting nearer there she was still sitting proud.Took some photos then a couple of days later we were on the free Passport Bus having a look around and it took us straight to the Queen. We got off there and had a good close up look.Now a hotel and 4 restaurants she is still a slick vessel .Had no urge to go inside as recently we cruised on the new Queen Mary to Norway.A lot of history here sitting in the harbour and still proudly accommodating many guests.",roy v
40,something,"This place is really haunted. It's interesting tho. Room B340 is probably closed still, but if it's available, please do not stay there. Many bad things happen(ed) there. You may experience something you've never wanted to. By the way I think it's a good place, I recommend!",eshter gorog
50,Great place to walk around,"We walked here from the Aquarium area. It's a nice walk by the water. Queen Mary is more impressive than I expected. There's also an awesome old war submarine there too. I would've liked to go on the haunted tour, but the prices and tour details were difficult to see because the line was so long. Didn't get to go in but it looked pretty cool.",JH_10999
50,"This historic, who would think otherwise","Arrived Easter Sunday, egg hunt for the kids and a pleasant tour. Yes it’s old 1936, but still a marvel.

30,Meh,I don't know what the fuzz is about. It was overprized and large. Go spend your money some where else,Kasper S
50,Educational,This was my first time visiting inside the queen Mary. It was very educational and pretty impressive. It costs $40 per adult to tour the inside which I thought is a little pricey but we spent all afternoon touring and hanging on the decks enjoying the SoCal weather. There is a 4-D theater which was great for the kiddos. It was only a 15 minute showing about sharks but I came out learning more about them. There are two restaurants on board. One is fine dining and the other is more casual but both are on the pricey side. There is a room for the kids to enjoy in the shipyard. LEGO room. The cost of entry goes down to $13 per adult at 6:00p but that’s only because guided tours and the bottom of the ship tour close at that time. The ship closes at 8:00p,aydren
30,Great for History Buffs,"This was a very nice trip into the past. The Queen Mary has a wonderfully rich history as a luxury ocean liner (not a cruise ship) hosting celebrities and royals on its quick and many journeys between England and the U.S. it became a troop ship, the Grey Ghost that cleverly eluded enemy ships and subs. Because of its rich past, the historical aspects of the Queen Mary are its best assets. The current ship is in need of refurbishment so you have to use your imagination to see how glorious this ship might have been. The decks can be slippery so wear low heeled shoes or sneakers. The tours are great!! The guides are terrific. The food is a bit over priced but good. The Illusionist act was amazing. The hotel level had seen better days. Still worth the trip! Make sure to take the steam and steel tour for a trip to the deepest parts of the ship!",amgundry2018
30,Conference finale,"Attended a final team building exercise and cocktail at the Queen Mary but doing the treasure hunt and my team was First Place and members were rewarded QM Beer Can Coaties. The treasure hunt was good but can see many parts of the ship in sad shape as nobody had done any maintenance for a long time. The organizer was stingy on the finger food part as only grilled vegetables, cubed cheese and crackers were available to go with a very ordinary bar service. The overall experience is below my expectation.",archie852
50,History on Water,"Took a trip to the historic Queen Mary which I've always wanted to do, loved it. I love old war ship and this one was on my list to visit. Loved the decor but a bit pricey. Would visit again for sure.",Kelly B
40,Worth booking a superior room,"The first room we were offered was really horrible, tiny portholes and very tired and old-fashioned looking. It had lino outside and was clearly going to be very noisy. We then upgraded to a suite, and that was more like it! It was so large we couldn't even find the single room (ex maid's room!) and had to phone reception for instructions! THAT was what I had envisioned. I slept like a log, though my friend suffered noise from the next door suite. That was not the ship's fault though. We also enjoyed an excellent lunch on board.",Janecanaries
40,Experience the History,"Supposedly one of the most haunted places in the world, we of course had to take the ghost tour of the ship. Our guide told very compelling accounts of people who claimed to have seen spirits and apparitions in various places on the Queen Mary. I do like to listen to a good ghost story, and I found it very interesting that many people have experienced similar encounters throughout the years.Aside from the tour we took, the ship itself is awesome to explore. I enjoyed our venture down to the engine room and seeing the propeller from inside the ""propeller box"" underwater. It's crazy to imagine being on the ship when it was in use, especially during the war.",Aleena Luisier
40,Back in time,Stayed 1 night on the Queen Mary for a tradeshow. This place is unreal. Feel like you are back in time! Just be ready for the room to be also back in time.. nothing fancy in these rooms.. wifi works fine.. Bed comfortable.. Shower and bathroom is dated a bit but part of the charm.,FamilleBenoit
40,Something for everyone,"Visiting the Queen Mary is like going back in time. Everything about the ship is impressive, especially when you consider that it was built 90 years ago at the height of the Depression. There are a number of tours available. We opted for the Steam and Steel tour which takes you into the bowels of the ship to see the engines, generators and propellers of the ship. Clearly not a tour that everyone will appreciate. Unfortunately, a lot of what was in this area of the boat has been removed for safety or space reasons so you have to imagine what it looked like. Still, it was interesting and our guide was knowledgeable and eager to answer most questions about the boat (except for questions about the ghosts). There were kids on our tour who seemed bored but most of the adults enjoyed it. I preferred seeing the parts of the boat that the guests used especially old photographs of celebrities who graced the decks. Also interesting were the quarters used by the captain and crew. After the tour, you are allowed to wander. We found our way to the cabin where the captains steered the boat and there was a nice gentleman stationed there who also gave us more information about the QM. The Queen Mary is a throwback to a different generation and well worth a visit although you may want to consider choosing your tours. You can purchase a combine admission with the Aquarium of the Pacific which gives you a discount. The Aquarium is a ""must see"" and you can easily do both in the same day.",Susan L
50,Amazing Opportunity and Great Location,"If you are looking for a good place to spend the night(s) while visiting Southern California, especially the Long Beach area, you will not be disappointed with the Queen!After having stayed here over 20 years ago I was expecting a poorly maintained hunk of metal, but the current owners have done an amazing job of restoration and maintenance.This trip I was fortunate to have one of the larger rooms, much nicer than the small version.Spend time exploring the ship & enjoy.",zapprint
50,An incredible historical artefact,"This is a simply staggering thing to still exist - a glimpse of Britain’s former imperial glory and an understanding of a now outmoded form of transport and societal interaction. The guides are well informed and friendly and if someone could only come along and give it all a lick of paint and some proper care, this would be the world beating attraction it really ought to be. Go and visit!",malcolm79
20,Disappointed,"We knew this was an old ship, but the rooms are very small. The whole ship needs to be restored. Everything is at an angle or slanted. The lighting is terrible and the carpets need cleaned. The engine room area is very neat and it seems to have been restored to an acceptable condition.",rshkj
40,The Queen Mary,"They could not find our reservations at first Not Queen Marys fault seem that who ever my wife booked this through made some errors. The cabin we had was clean and comfortable, we took a tour through he bottom of the ship and engineering area tour guide was great.",cl_Wi
50,Historical and amazing!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. My dad sailed on her when he was young, so I enjoyed exploring and maybe repeating his steps. Yes the walls are thin so you can hear the neighbors conversations. I do wish the desk clerks would explain charges better. The workout room was locked but I think we paid a fee for daily use?? The engine tour was well worth it!",sjentzsch1
50,Had a Lovely meal in Churchills restaurant,We had a New Year's day meal in the churchill restaurant and food was excellent could have been hotter but was very enjoyable and the walk around the ship was nice to see how t was back in the days of a long gone era but also very enjoyable walk.,Steven M
50,Most interesting Place in Long Beach !,"Great for a Solo Visit with Family or Couples. Many interesting things to see on the old ship, some great food in one of the restaurants.

Most of the ship is open to explore, keep in mind it is a working hotel.Tips:- Consider a combo ticket to other area attractions, such as the Aquarium of the Pacific- Arrive early to book times on the multiple tour offerings- Dine on the ship or grab a drink, it will certainly feel authentic!",Michael M
50,An amazing piece of history!,"Downtown Long Beach is not very big and for a small city, you don’t have a shortage of fun places to see. Just a hop on the FREE Red Line bus service, we got off at the Queen Mary. As we walked closer to the ship, you can see that it is simply majestic! To get onboard you must buy a tour ticket. Depending on your time availability and budget, they have several tours to choose from. We took the First Class tour. Once onboard, you get brought back in time. Your first stop, the Promenade Deck. There you start your tours and peruse the shops. It would be advisable to wear comfortable shoes because the only way to check every corner of the ship is by walking along long hallways and climbing up and down stairs (lots of them). You get to go down below sea level to the boiler and engine rooms. You even get to see one of its propellers. You get to go up to the Wheel Well too. All in all, the package I had allowed me to tour the ship within 5 hours. The tour guides were pleasant and very knowledgeable. The fixtures and walls of the ship were magnificent, holding true to its Art Deco theme. The ship had a lot of stories to tell. If you’re a history and art enthusiast, it is easy to enjoy a visit to this place.",Cathy L
50,Queen Mary Stay,"We stayed overnight in a deluxe king suite. It’s worth it to have a room with portholes!The room was fairly spacious and the bed comfortable. While the amenities are not what you get in a Hilton or Marriott, you are on a cruise ship from days past!It was very enjoyable and the history of this ship is impressive. The tours are informative and well done!Lots of things to look at and read when you walk about. We spent 4 or 5 hours on a couple of tours, walking around on our own and having lunch from the coffee shop.Prices are a bit elevated, but not out of line compared to other tourist attractions.We had very good service from hotel staff and others on the ship-it was a really enjoyable experience. Recommend!!",Dianna D
50,So much history,"First of all, do not be naive... This is an old historic ship. It takes pride in being old and ghostly. So don’t come here expecting “room upgrades” and “luxury”. Again, it is an old historic ship. If you just need hotel for a night, stay somewhere else in the area: room are antique and dated, no fridge in room, there is absolutely no isolation so you can listen to one of your neighbors release gas all night and a couple next door have loud ehh... making love, which becomes very awkward when you are staying in a room with a kid.But, if you are here to experience history and what it was like back then, we’ll, upgraded somewhat to bring you all the comfort that they could while still keeping surroundings relatively untouched, come on board!I was here for the Strange Escapes events ghost hunting and attending lectures for three nights. It was so much fun. However, I know you probably won’t be there for that so absolutely do the daily tours they have. I did the first one and the second one: Glory Days Historical Tour and Haunted Encounters Tour. Each tour is 45 mins to 1 hour and cost $10. Both were simply fascinating! If you go, ask for Daniel. He was here doing tours for 13 years and he is amazing. I liked him so much, I had to make sure my second tour, which was Haunted Encounters, was with him. Because he was here that long and working late, he had many personal experiences which he will tell you about. Historical tour was so interesting. Absolutely must... with Daniel as your guide.I also did Illusions of the Past with Aiden Sinclair and I give it a 4. I was a bit bored. If you are into this stuff, go see Paranormal The Mind Reading MagicShow in Vegas at Bally’s. Now, that beats Aiden’s shoes by a long shot. Read TripAdvisor reviews for the Paranormal Mind Reading show in Vegas and you will see. The guy knew the name of our cat at home was Fat Cat and could guess any number between 1 and 99 you are thinking about. He must figured out all the inns and outs of the Matrix.So, head to The Queen Mary and enjoy your stay at this amazing historic ghostly ship.",AnnaWest24
50,Beautiful old ship,"If you are in Long Beach you simply have to see this ship, it’s magnificent. Take the tour down to the engine room, see the enormous propeller, stand on the bridge and imagine what steering this enormous ship would be like. I thoroughly enjoyed this attraction.",David B
50,More than expected,We attended the glory days tour. It was perfect to get to know the history of the ship. Guide was entertaining and knowledgeable.,ncrivera
40,Don't miss this floating hotel.,"Talk about stepping back in time. The history and stories of this incredible vessel are endless. Be sure to take a tour as you will miss much, but also watch the video and you will realize why this ship is so special. I might suggest that you bring a Kleenex too to dry your eyes during the video - it's moving!",illyman
40,Sunday Brunch is a fun event....then you can walk around the boat.,We went for brunch - must make a reservation. Took the 10am slot I recommend you do the same. Being the first one's in made a difference in the feel and beauty of the spacious ballroom and display of the food. The waitstaff was simply incredible. They are right there when you need them and are very free-wheeling with the mimosas. We had to slow them down...if our 3-year old was not with us we really would have gotten after it. The food was all very top notch with the exception of the oysters. They were not as fresh that day as I would have liked. The crab legs made for a good substitute. We also have brunch at Trump National GC in RPV and this is on par food and service-wise. Both are completely different from each other in terms of the surroundings and environment. I put them both on equal footing. One thing to note this is not inexpensive 2pp +4 year old with tip was $205.00. Trump's is about $20 less... After brunch you are able to wander the ship and it really is cool. The 20's deco architecture and natural woods make this place very unique. I found myself touching the walls and admiring the craftsmanship of this nearly 100 year old ship. We had a very nice experience wandering the halls if the ship.... We ran into a man who has been the piano player for many years (Andy) and he was just off his shift heading home. He chatted us up and noticed it was our first visit. For the next 30-minutes he gave a tour of the ship with history. I cannot express how grateful we were for that. The kindness he showed to us and our son will never be forgotten. I hope he sees this because he really did make a nice impact on us. We are now looking at staying over night on the ship for a fun and different night out.,John R
50,loved the ambience and history,I enjoyed the haunted tour and the Diana exhibit.I loved the ambience and history of the Ship. And drinks in the bar were awesome,kelly
40,Interesting,"Worth a visit, however, I do feel the ship was looking a little tired !! I think with the amount they charge for entry it should be brought up to date as if it was still in its 'spendour'. Visited the engine room which was very interesting, but this was at additional cost.",Suzanne G
20,Not worth the price,"The Queen Mary has seen its' better days as a tourist attraction. The ticket prices do not meet the standards of what one should expect at that price. We did not wish to do a guided tour, but you are still charged the same amount. Most of the ship is in run down condition and most of the interesting areas (The Bridge in particular) were closed off and not available for viewing during our visit.",Stephen O
10,"Impressive gift shop, but that's it","Luckily we were forewarned that the Queen Mary is disappointing, unfortunately it was worse than we had prepared ourselves for.There are various tickets to choose and we did go for the self-guided tour, although were surprised when we got to visiting the engine room that this had an additional charge. By that point we’d gone past caring for the ship and just left. There are also additional exhibits you can see, one about Prince Di and the other Churchill, but these didn’t interest us.Essentially though we paid to be let onboard, everywhere we could walk round was just the ship, no information, no direction and the decks were expanses of emptiness, looking tired and covered in rubbish.The American spirit kicked back in when you got to the vast gift shop and I must say the range of items on offer was truly impressive, ranging from your usual fridge magnet and snow globe, through to a stress ship (stress ball). If the experience had been better, maybe we would have snapped up more in here.I would not recommend this attraction.",louisj92
20,Way Overpriced,We decided to visit the Queen Mary while staying in Huntington Beach because it had been many years since we visited. We were shocked to find out the price was $46.!!!There are no options on tours and our first tour was terrible and we did not want to do our next scheduled tour. We did the most popular tour instead and were thankful we ended our visit with that. Not worth the price.,Cappie G
40,Historic piece of history worth the visit,"I visited with my family over the winter break, and found the Queen Mary to be amazing - it is like the ""fixed"" version of the Titanic. We took a couple of the tours of this gigantic ship, one of the history, and one of the mechanics - and both are well worth it, I would say you must take these tours. They have a couple okay restaurants on-board, and I am not sure how the ""hotel"" experience is. The ship is gigantic, so walking kind of at a random can be overwhelming, and without any audio tour sometimes it can be hard to discern the history behind what you are looking at. Definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area, but plan on doing a LOT of walking!",toddone1
40,Unique Experience,"Historic, legendary, iconic and timeless. This is a must see and experience when visiting Long Beach. This is time warping in grand fashion. It is literally jaded grandeur redefined as if you’re immersed in 1930’s Art Deco. Everything is to marvel at, especially hand laid wood veneers on an astonishing scale. The rooms are vintage as if you traveled back in time.",Russ Lacuata
20,Too expensive,We wanted to go aboard to have lunch-$46.00 per person to board ship 🛳- outrageous price just to walk the ship & lunch was extra charge. Clerk at counter was rude.No senior discount either . Disappointed 😞,Melanie S
50,Get the most for your money - touring at your own pace,"We took Mom&Dad to the Queen Mary as a Christmas present. Initially, we planned to stay overnight, but Mom was a little wigged out by the thought of the whole haunted/ghost aspect, so we opted out of that. We did not take advantage of the champagne brunch @ $79ea. We did not purchase the tour tickets in advance online because we noticed a convenience fee ($40 for all tours plus $6 convenience=$46). There is also a parking fee ($18 for the day I think).So, here is what we learned - keep in mind we prefer to go at our own pace and so were not particularly interested in any of the scheduled guided tours - that could change this experience. There were knowledgeable people in the helm and radio room that were happy to talk with us despite not being on a 'guided' tour.1-If you go to the ship to buy tickets, the tour package is $46 anyway (same as online in advance), BUT they do have some discounts. Military discount was $10 off each ticket with valid ID (this can be active/retired/dependent), they probably had other discounts too, but she said military was the 'best' one. (When you buy the tickets, you can sign up for guided tour times, but it sounded like many were 'booked up' as the people in front of us could not get to the tour they wanted until 1:45pm and we arrived at 10:30am. You may want to consider going the night before - maybe you could buy 'next day' tickets and reserve your guided tour times... not sure.)2-If you stay at the hotel, you have access to all 'self-guided' tour areas with no additional cost, including the 4D theater, the Engine room - everything - so if you have any inkling to stay overnight - that's a really good consideration.3-if you go for Sunday brunch, there is an option for no champagne also - which is $10 less (so $69). If you go for brunch - you also have access to all 'self-guided' tour areas with no additional cost (same as staying overnight). So, then really brunch is like $30, which isn't bad considering the amazing location and view! (If I went back, I would most likely do this.)4-if you end up not staying or doing Sunday brunch and just do the day-tour tickets, highly recommend going to the helm to the Observation Bar, ordering yourself a nice libation (I recommend Pimm's cup, albeit a little pricey) and go enjoy the view outside. The observation bar was featured in the film 'Being John Malkovich,' so it is fun to experience the bar itself. Take a great picture here or outside (with your libation) and then ask the great bartenders to validate your parking (brings you from an $18 parking charge to an $8 charge) and then ask for a 'to go' cup so you can continue to enjoy your cocktail while you wander throughout the ship.5-I'm glad we just did this with adults. I'm sure our teen boys would have enjoyed it, but not for the extended time we spent poking around.... reading everything we could find... checking out every level of the engine room.... talking extensively with the workers in the helm and radio rooms..... etc.6-there is a lot of the ship that can be experienced both inside and out, but take note that there are really uneven floors and stairs to get everywhere. Luckily, there are also very sturdy railings - so my Dad, even with two bad knees - did pretty well - we just took our time and he used the railings to make sure he was offloading as much weight when going up and down stairs as possible. There ARE elevators, but they only go to the main floors and will not get you everywhere you might want to see (that would require.... using stairs).",Tricia I

50,Historic,Totally enjoyed this visit. Ocean liner with a lot of history. You can do a tour or just walk around. We just explored on our own. Beautiful original wood plenty to see and the engine room is a engineering marvel. Fun day and we spent the night.,John P
50,Very well done ghost tour,We did the 8 pm one-hour ghost tour. It was very well done in that our guide didn’t oversell it. He gave us a very grounded approach and told great stories with a little deadpan humor that made it a very enjoyable experience. We walked quite a bit and covered a good portion of the ship. We were really glad we did it.,FEN_10
40,"A grand old ship of historical significance, worth seeing but has not been preserved well","First it should be noted that this fine old ship is now being used primarily as a hotel, and the needs of the hotel come first. It was a great ship, the height of glamour in its days when it was the fastest ocean liner in the world. However it is now decidedly rough round the edges.We did all three tours in early February, the first was the 'ghost' tour, which was given by a young man who desperately tried to make something interesting out of not very much. The one item he glossed over very quickly was the incident in the war when due to an error of navigational judgement the Queen Mary rammed the destroyer HMS Curacao slicing it in two and resulting in the deaths of over 320 sailors.The second tour was of the engine rooms and although the tour guide was exceptionally good, he was faced with doing a tour of the bottom of the ship saying 'this is where boiler number x was. this is where engine number x was. It was near the end of the tour before he was able to show us an engine, propeller shaft and the one remaining propeller. Everything else had to be ripped out when the ship was laid up in Long Beach, to ensure it could never be used again as a ship.The third tour was the 'Glamour Days' tour. The young man although word perfect on his script, really didn't know how to engage with his audience. Someone more experienced could have made this tour far more interesting instead it was an embarrassment for him and us.So overall the 'self guided tour', which we didn't do, would probably have been a better idea.The ship is definitely worth seeing because of its historical significance, but I'm sorry to say that overall it was something of a disappointment.",Alan R
40,Annual Highland Games,"We've been to the Queen Mary a number of times for the annual Highlands Games event in February, and stayed on the ship.The boat is a living historic museum!Rooms are small and obviously old, but they have a charm about them.The various on-board restaurants and bars are neat, offering plenty of options for a meal or cocktails.",Clan Bacon
20,You get what you pay for,stayed here while waiting to board a Carnival Cruise. This is an old ship in need of more renovation. The price was reasonable considering the area but you get what you py for.One night I had no hot water. The room temperature was either freezing or warm. The wall paper n the room was peeling.There was one outlet in the room with a power cube. There was no wifi in the room as you are down in the ship. It was convenient to go to the area for the cruise but it would have been just as easy to stay at a nicer place and take a cab over. The main bar area had excellent service. This was good but this former fine looking bar had four or five of the eats at the bar that were torn and in need of repair.The directions for getting around on the ship were not very good. There were a few elevators out of service that would have made getting around easier.the on board gym did look modern and clean,Paul S
40,A must see in Long Beach,I walked through the Queen Mary independently and did not take one of the tours. It was still totally worth it. So much history on display with good signage especially in the infirmary. My favorite part were the short films called Voices of Queen Mary. Wonderful!! I also enjoyed the information shared by the gentlemen in the navigation room about the methods of communication. The beauty of the ship has been maintained so it is easy to imagine its grandeur as an ocean liner.,notcarla
50,"She's a grand old lady, what's not to love?","Great ship, great tours, great gift shop, great history. Loved the artifacts from the film ""The Darkest Hour"". They nailed the war rooms as we've seen the real ones in London so well done. The 4-D film is a bit silly, not really even 3-D so the only effect is you get a bit wet and a poke in the back. Other than that it was a solid 7 hours of fun and I wish we'd had a bit more time so I could have stayed for dinner.",Baxterthetravelguy

10,Horrible customer service! Not willing to work with their customers when a mistake was made!,"I was so excited to stay here but the manager James is not willing to work with the guests!! I am here for my birthday and was looking forward to this stay but now it is ruined and I’m out 150! We originally reserved a reservation on hotels.com but then decided to book a new room, a full suite! And 100 more then the original room. We thought we canceled our original reservation, I even checked all my reservations before this trip and didn’t see it anymore listed.. when we checked in we were told I still had that room but if we called hotels.com they’d let us cancel without charge.. the front desk girl was super nice about it.. well I called hotels.com and they told me they had to talk to the hotel.. they get back on the phone and now tell me the hotel will still charge use for the night even if we cancel the room.. we talked to the manager James finally and he REFUSES to help us!You could tell I had been crying, telling him I don’t have the money for the extra room and we are still out here for a week.. (only one night here though thankfully) also that we are now in a more expensive room and spending a lot of money here with the tours and restaurants on the ship and he refuses to make any exception or help us! He also lied and told us that it was hotels.com that is charging us and up to them But they keep telling me that it is up to the Queen Mart and if the Queen Mary gives the ok I won’t be charged. They also told me that it is the Queen Mart that charges me because I did not pre pay for it . The hotel also claimed I was already charged but I see nothing on my bank account yet. I also have it on recording of hotels.com telling me that it is up to the Queen Mary to still charge us or not. I could understand if we didn’t show up at all, but this was an honest mistake and the fact they aren’t willing to do something to help us out!It is the Queen Mary that is not willing to work with a customer spending $100s there. If they truly cared about their customers they’d be willing to work with them and keep them satisfied.Also, I will be posting videos of this on my YouTube channel and this review everywhere! I want everyone to know how horrible the service is here!",Stephy D

20,Outdated Business Model Sinks the Ship,"I wanted to take my British cousins on a tour of the Queen Mary when they visited Long Beach. Went on-line to see tour choices and pricing. The website left me confused on how to book a basic tour without the many add ons. It turns out one must book a ""full passage"" - at $46 per person (including the service fee) - to board the ship and take a basic history tour. Yes, one can take other tours offered with your ""passage,"" but all we wanted was the history tour and perhaps have a meal while there. I thought this was a steep price to pay and decided not to book the tour. The Queen's pricing structure appears outdated (think cable TV) for offering a basic tour at a reasonable price. Instead, we had lunch across the bay which offered a panorama view of the ship.",Frank M
40,Pricey but so interesting,"We went here with a Go LA card, without that I wouldn't have felt that it was worth the money. It's about $50 to get on the boat and then more money for each tour and the 4d theater. We find history fascinating and this boat has so many stories to tell. We went on the haunted tour because we thought it would keep the kids more entertained, it was kinda dumb, but we did get the tour of the boat and some of the history. I can't understand how it functions as a real hotel, the rooms seem to be tiny, there's no pool and people are constantly touring in the hallways, but the history and the ship itself is incredible. we ended up missing the 4d show because the timing didn't work out with our tour. Also the elevators were messed up so we did the stairs alot and got tired and there were a ton of little bugs flying around which was kind of gross.",Tzivia R
10,Talk about overpriced!,"As a Brit who has recently moved to the area, how could I not visit this iconic ship? As you first see the ship you cannot help be impressed with its beauty - a piece of history. The parking was extortionate so we parked in the restaurant nearby and walked through the park along the waters edge.Walking to the ship takes you back to a long ago era / reminiscent of the Titanic. You can’t help but be blown away by its stature.Unfortunately you’re also blown away by the cost to have a tour. There were I believe 3 different tours which you can only book together for $47 each. No wonder the whole area was empty. We thought maybe we’d just go to the restaurant to have a coffee but you have to pay for the tour to get into the restaurant!!!! What a huge disappointment.I have to add that the area itself is a shambles with what looks like a mock Tudor village having been built and disbanded nearby. Not sure if it was believed that the Ship was built in the Tudor era - quite bizarre.Spending time on the other side of the harbour which is vibrant and packed with people, I think perhaps the owners need to think about reducing their prices to encourage visitors to see this amazing piece of history. It feels more liked it’s been docked there as a money many scheme.Meanwhile just spent the day in the Simi Valkey visiting the Ronald Reagan library. $29 for a whole day of fascination - now that’s value!!!",Justine S
10,Boring trip,"This site was included in our Go Card so we went to see it as we’d spend the day in Long Beach. We booked a Haunting tour but they put our time down as about 3 hrs from then. So we walked around the ship with nothing that special to look at, thinking of how we could stretch out the time until the tour started. About 1.5 hrs later we decided to leave as there was nothing much there to view. The signs for direction were really bad as well and there wasn’t anyone around we could ask for assistance.",Lucy

To hear the role the ship played in WWII was great too. They also had a replica of the war room used in the movie ""Darkest Hour"" which was so realistic!",Frank M

The only decent event is the annual Scottish Festival which draws huge crowds.,mdsaction
10,"Visit to tour, but DO NOT STAY ON BOARD OVERNIGHT","The ship itself was great, and very cool, however the estate rooms are hideous. We booked a mini suite (A008) and what a tremendous disappointment!!! Antique and nostalgic are just fine by us, but this room was just plain old and not maintained on any level: wall covering (not sure if it was wallpaper or not) was peeling off, stains on carpet and furniture, AC/Heat did not function properly (couldn't regulate temperature), electrical outlets so worn they would hardly hold the plugs in, finish on both bathtubs was peeling off, corrosion all around the tub drains as well as drain plugs, and little details such as furniture and cabinet hardware missing or not functional. Frankly, we left and stayed at the Hilton Long Beach. We didn't tell the front desk because when I asked the bellman if all the rooms were that way, he said ""yep, they're all this way"". We were supposed to stay there three nights. Instead, we stayed somewhere else three nights, all the while paying for the room on the Queen Mary as well!!! It was worth it...It's unfortunate because that experience could be so nice...apparently the ownership hasn't invested in restoring or maintaining the guest rooms",Scott S

Traditional ball room in the main hall and a stage with hip hop and contemporary outside on the stern.

The ship itself is full of beautiful paneling.",Denise O
20,Save your money and stay elsewhere,"Our family was really looking forward to staying on the Queen Mary. My sons have fascinations with large ships, especially the QM and Titanic so they were thrilled with the prospect of staying over for a few days during Christmas.The overall stay was extremely disappointing and not worth the price we paid. We arrived Christmas night and although busier than expected, it was not overwhelming, which was good. After we got checked in, we had the ""joy"" of trying to find our room with the horrible signage situation on the ship. If your staff is aware of the complete lack of signage then they should use the map to direct guests on the best way to get to their room. Lugging suitcases and two kids up and down stairs, through meandering hallways only to get lost is not my idea of fun. We were not the only ones as we ran into at least 10 other guests in the same situation.Once we get into our rooms, it was dirty. A Motel 8 is cleaner! There were disgusting stains on our carpet, crumbs everywhere, the bathroom sink, toilet and tub still had hair from the previous guest(s). The beds had no comforters which would have been nice considering the heat did not work! The room was bare bones, not even a hair dryer or a cup to rinse your mouth and not at all as advertised. Dingy wallpaper that was stained and ripping. No hangers in the closets either.Before dinner we walked the ship to get our bearings. Again, we got lost at least 5-6 times and tripped over ripped carpet. The ship could use some SERIOUS maintenance and a signage overhaul. I understand the is old and historical but historical doesn't not been bad maintenance for simple things like cleanliness or holes in the carpet.We tried to find all the Christmas events in hopes that it would make the time enjoyable....nope. Just some string lights down a hallway and on the mast. The ship inside wasn't even really decorated except for the main 2 halls and one hallway. They had one area for crafts, which from what I understand was a last minute booking for the company. And that was it. I would have been upset if I paid not as a hotel guest but general adminissions for this garbage of a tourist trap. It would have cost over $100 for our family if we did general adminission (not including $22 for parking).We went to Christmas dinner at the Chelsea Chower House, we made a reservation for 730pm several days in advance, we did not get called in until close to 8pm even asking about the reservation several times as the hostesses were also taking walk-ins and putting them into the mix. Not sure why a reservation takes a back seat to a walk-in, this was disappointing. By this point, we had some seriously hungry and cranky kids. Sat down finally and waited about another 15 mins for our waiter. Total bill for 2 burgers, 2 kids meals, a calamari appetizer with 2 soups and 4 sodas came to over $100!.Next day, we did not stay on the ship as the kid's were incredibly bored. All the tours would have cost $40 for each (wow, discounted rate for guests!) so we spent the day in Long Beach which was amazing and highly recommended.That night, went to sleep around 9pm with this aweful banging noise that happened every 2-3 seconds right outside our room. Sounded like a metal door was left open and the wind was taking it and hitting it againdt a metal railing. Called guest service and they did nothing about it. The banging did not stop until 3am, which was also the time I was finally able to go to sleep and the heat decided to turn on. We could not cool down the room at all.I would not recommend anyone to stay at this overpriced, dilapidated ""hotel"". Save your money and stay in a nicer hotel in Long Beach and take pictures from afar!",BonD
40,Historical bucketlist,We couldn't pass up on the chance to see this historical ship. Very cool to see inside this time period. The price was kinda high to get in. I didn't see any ghosts. One time visit was good enough. I only stayed just 2 hours because we had other things to see. I would recommend this to others who care about history but not for parents of young children.,lovinthatfood
10,Not a great start,"Check in was at 4.. got here early.l just to be safe. Wrong idea. Didn't get my room until 430. Monica in the front was nice at first but once I came back to the front desk to speak with someone else she jumped into the conversation and was really rude about it. Got the room for my 2 children, my fiancé and I by my boss. She couldn't pay for it because they needed to run the card the front desk said. Ok fine. I present my card. Room was for 150. I just checked my card. Almost $300! I understand that they need to make sure it's there but double the amount! I'm still here as I write this.. I hope the neighbors next door with about 7 people in that room quite down once we come back later tonight... you definitely have to pay for everything else on the boat even if you are staying in the hotel.. so far not relaxing at all. I'll update this tomorrow morning to see how it went...",Ricky C
50,Moving Experience,"We stayed here for 4 nights and thoroughly got overawed by the visit. At one point I was sure that I was being followed by a ghost and had a real shiver down the spine. Yes, as others have said the paints a bit chipped and the carpets need changed but all adds to the vintage feeling. A must do when visiting California. It’s about 50 minutes in an Uber from LA.",Boyd Y
40,Good tour of lovely old liner - expensive parking!!!!!,"As Brits, it was a lovely nostalgic tour of a wonderful old liner, once the pride of the fleet; yes, as others have pointed out, parts of the ship are worn and in need of TLC, but if you do a guided tour (we did the Glory Days) you get to see parts that otherwise are not open to the general public wandering around unescorted.I think our tickets were some $28 each, which seemed quite expensive, but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - in addition to the tour, we went down below to the old engine rooms (the view of the last remaining turbine underwater is awesome!), saw the bridge and the officers quarters, had a drink outside the coffee shop, and could have watched the film about the history of the ship - so there is plenty to keep you occupied whilst waiting for the timed tour. Our guide was excellent - informative and witty, only sorry I can't remember his name!Two gripes: I appreciate that the ship is now a fully operational working hotel, but it would have lovely to have seen a couple of the cabins on the guided tour - maybe a luxury class, and an 'economy' class for comparison - this would have made the tour complete for me.The other gripe is the extortionate cost of parking a car to visit the Queen Mary; the signage quoted lures you into thinking it is reasonable for 1 or 2 hours, but if you want to get the most out of a visit to the ship, then you need at least 3 hours, which is what we spent there - and got charged a ludicrous $18 for the privilege. Talk about ripping off the tourists?!However - if you know what to expect price-wise, don't hesitate to visit this wonderful old lady of the high seas!",JJ Whippet
50,Cool old ship,"We didn't pay to go in, we just parked in the carpark and had a good look. Didn't know the Russian sub was there too. It was interesting as well. Well worth a look. Up to you if you pay the tour fee to go up onto the ship or not. We were pushed for time and just have a good look over the whole Huntington Beach to Long Beach stretch.",Smithysfishing
50,Fun place for conference,Came here for a conference and it was a very unique experience. Loved the exhibits and the engine room is spectacular. Stopped by for happy hour at the bar and it had beautiful views,Meghan
50,Queen Mary Sunday Brunch,"This is by no means the cheapest Sunday brunch I’ve ever had but it certainly ranks as one of the best. I choose to do this for my 60th birthday. The setting is opulent and stunning a band plays in the background. The staff are courteous and polite, the food is wonderful, and extremely varied. The seafood is stunning, and I e cravings lovelyThe Cunard commandore ( pretend of course ) wanders the dinning room, all dressed up a very personable older gentleman who takes his role seriously, and is great fun. I’d recommend this brunch especially if you are celebrating",Margaret M
10,Not worth the trip,"After shelling out big bucks to park we walked to the entrance. Paid the entrance fee and just walked around a dry docked old ship. Not much to see. Drinks are expensive, can’t see the allure. Keep your hard earned money. Don’t recommend this at all.",Elena M
50,Start Up the Holiday,"We had family come stay with us over Thanksgiving Day and weekend. We planned a couple of different things as they are from out of State and have not been to our area. We made it a complete day trip and were able to get a combined trip over to the Aquarium of the Pacific. We took one of the small tours that had great information and we enjoyed the Family time together. We loved the fact that we were able to take the bus from the Queen Mary to the Aquarium and back to the Queen Mary. Were we had parked. There are different places to eat and lots of things to see here. We toured the engine room, the Princess Diana exhibit and the Christmas Decorations were fabulous. Weather was perfect too!",Christine N
10,“Queen Mary Christmas - SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Brought my wife here for the ""Queen Mary Christmas,"" which should be renamed ""Give us $52 to walk around an old docked boat and get us to charge you more for everything - oh, and parking is $20 too."" Frankly, I want my money back. Please, save your money and buy whoever you are going with one more present. You’ll be glad you did.Absolute tourist trap. If you're in the area, admire it from afar and head over to Disneyland or Knotts Berry Farm. Not worth a cent of what you're going to pay. Santa doesn't even have a real beard... obviously fake, the guy was shaping it while we peeked in for a quick photo (we were quickly shooed away)...Honestly, they should pay us to come here and get got. Ridiculous. I'm surprised they don't have someone walk around and charge you to take photos on your phone...",Phil C
50,Awesome Historical Ship Experience,"Love the Queen Mary! There are several tours to choose from and you can easily do several in a day. This ship has so much history as a luxury ocean liner in its heyday and also as a military ship. Beautiful art decor throughout the entire ship, nice restaurants, friendly staff, great views of Long Beach, and overall a very memorable experience. Have visited the Queen Mary several times over the years.",Yvette P
50,Well preserved ship with excellent guided tour!,"I have been to Long Beach a few times over the past few years visiting from the United Kingdom. I have always seen the Queen Mary on the horizon from the main areas in Long Beach, but have never paid a visit.During my latest visit to Long Beach in November 2018, I decided to finally walk over to the Queen Mary and pay her a visit and am I glad I finally did!It is approx $40 dollars per person to enter the Queen Mary (unless you are staying in the onboard hotel) which is quite expensive at first look, but totally worth it as the ticket includes quite a lot. The ticket included a 4D theatre located at the stern of the ship which has several choices of shows to choose from and it also includes the option of several different guided tours.I decided to go to the 4D theatre first which was quiet at the time I visited. The show was all about the history of the ship with some cool effects like water splashing at you etc. The show wasn’t too long but it was very interesting.After that, I walked around the rear of the ship and had a look at the internals and the one remaining propeller of the ship. At the time I visited, they were decorating the ship for Christmas so there were parts of the ship that were quite messy with boxes and Christmas decorations on the floor but didn’t really cause too much issue.After walking around the stern, I decided to go to the main promenade deck of the Queen Mary and booked a tour of the supposedly haunted areas of the ship. Most of the tours are included with the entrance fee, but you do still need to reserve a spot on the tours. Looking back now, I wish I went to the tour room on the main deck first to book several tours as by the time I went, there wasn’t many spaces left so could only get on one tour during the time I was there.The tour I went on was fantastic! The tour guide was very funny and he presented the tour with a lot of enthusiasm and involved the whole group. He gave information on the history of the areas we visited along with stories of ghost and spirit sightings in different areas right up to the present day. He took us right into the belly of the ship to areas not normally accessible.Overall I was very impressed with the Queen Mary and will definitely visit her again when I am next in Long Beach.I strongly recommend doing some of the guided tours as they are great fun.Just bear in mind that some of the tours access areas of the ship that can be challenging such as steep ladders and low ceilings.",traveladventures1988
50,A dream come true.,My spouse surprised me with a 5 night stay. Love the historical art deco feel. Lots of holiday activities for all ages. Restaurants have excellent meals.,Louanne H
50,Ghost Tour..Excellent!,"The ghost tour featured a good historic overview, a sense of QM's featured guests and voyages. The background of spirits that haunt the ship is ""chilling""...i thought quite authentic..You will visit many areas of the ships ..for those who enjoy how large engines function..this is a must!I old indoor pool was the creepiest for me!",mariaaba
40,Stayed on Ship and explored on our own,"We stayed two nights on the ship. The prices are comparable to the hotels in area so it is a more unique lodging option. The ship is run down and doesn't seem to be restored as it ages, but it is a cool piece of history and interesting to roam around. We stayed busy elsewhere during the days so we didn't do any of the tours on the ship. The Sir Winston is a fancy schmanzy restaurant at the top that we went to after checking in. We had not done our research but they were gracious enough to let us eat in our jeans and tenny shoes anyway. Very expensive, but worth it if you can splurge. The other restaurant on board had a wonderful breakfast deal and we ate well there the next morning. Good thing we did a lot of walking since we did eat well. :) Fun, unique place to stay.",LovesTheWest
50,Great day!,"I wasn’t too keen on doing this but this was the only reason we came to Long Beach. Started off by doing the “haunted tour” whereby you go to different parts of the ship where the most paranormal sightings have been recorded. Tour guide was TOM and he was just fantastic, so down to earth, informative, friendly, professional and lovely. This was such a great start. Really good tour.Then did the “glory days” which felt loooong. Dillon was our tour guide and while very informative I felt he was overcompensating his nerves with reciting facts. Perhaps as Tom was so great I was expecting someone with a bit more ease. Very interesting tour though.Ended up at the observation bar as we’d been walking almost 4 hours around the ship and the service was great. Free refills on fountain drinks too. Comfy chairs etc.Definitely recommend if you’re a history buff, or even if you’re not!",Suttsm0302
50,So much history,We spent almost 4 hours on the Queen Mary and loved every minute of it. The ship is a little tired but the history is fascinating. We enjoyed two escorted tours on the ship and were surprised at the information we learned. Stopped for drink in the cool Art Deco Bar. Definitely a must see if you are in Long Beach,mariaallen1
50,Queen Mary,"I didn't want to go in the QM originally, but I'm glad I did. We did the self guided tour, basically wandering around as we wanted, and it was fun. Most of the ship was open to visitors, with some exceptions, ( it is an active hotel), so we saw everything from the engine rooms below deck to the Captain's quarters and bridge way above. It was well worth the admission fee.",Ilga P
50,Glory Days Tour,"If you had to pick only one attraction to see in Long Beach, this should be the one. Included in your admission ticket is the choice of one tour. I chose the Glory Days Historical Tour and I am so glad I did. I highly recommend it. Dustin was our tour guide and he did a fantastic job. Dustin was so knowledgeable and made the tour very interesting. Our group was pretty large and everyone was engaged and asking questions. I loved the tour.",LTay1234
40,My husband's Dream!,"My husband wanted to go all the way to Long Beach just for this! He loved it! We went on two tours. A regular one and the haunted one. Even though we had three kids, the haunted tour was great for them. I thought that we went in enough rooms, but my husband wanted to see more. My favorite was seeing the Lego model and finding the cat! We were confused on what we bought. I thought our tickets were for two movies since we bought two tours, but I guess it was only for one movie.",msum_rose
10,Know Before You Go,"The Queen Mary is amazing. What isn't amazing is their web site. My family and I decided to visit the ship yesterday. In the past, we visited often, always just walking onboard and strolling around for free (and, in the process of doing so, spending money!!). Last time we were there, the only charges were for for tours and special exhibits. To be on the safe side, we scoured the website. There was no mention of fees to get on the boat itself. Long story short, we would have paid close to $150, something we weren't prepared to do. The family in the queue ahead of us also walked away from the ticket booth ticket less, as did a couple who were told they would have to pay $30 up front in order to walk on the ship and sit down at a restaurant. Very poor business tactics.",jesseliz08
50,"Something to look forward to, Private Dining aboard the Queen Mary","It has been awhile since we had a corporate meeting which is semi annual. A first for me to experience private dining in the Prince Charles Room and the elegant plush atmosphere made it quite interesting and to be waiting on by more than one server and waiter. The wine was a nice Cabernet Sauvignon with the main dishes a filet mignon while others had prime rib and some other equally tasteful entree. The dim lighting made it romantic while we could look out at the twinkling lights of the shoreline of Long Beach. This is not my every day destination, only a special occasion.",Whimsicalartist
50,History Preserved,"This beautifully preserved part of the Cunard Line, is a stunner. I have been two a few functions in their main ballroom, and even today, the architecture, the wood work and even light fixtures, are so gorgeous.

50,After Dark Paranormal Tour,I had a blast on my after dark tour. Jackie was awesome and super nice!For anyone wanting to go in October to the after hours tours - DON’T do it unless you’re already at the tour. The traffic congestion is terrible for the Dark Harbour. There is no lane for hotel or tour guests - so it took me an hour and half to cross the bridge and get to the entrance.The tour staff was great and let me join the tour already started since traffic was so bad (and dark harbors fault).Highly recommend the tour!,Kelsey W
10,Queen Mary Dark Harbor Parking Nightmare Experience,"My friends and I got tickets to the Queen Mary Saturday October 28th. We got there around 7:30pm and waited in line for parking for almost two hours. Once we finally got to the entrance where you pay for parking, they told us the lots were all full, and we needed to park at an alternate location 15 minutes away, then find our way back to the Queen Mary. This was after we waited for two hours to park. No signs, no notifications, no way out of the line. The line to get in was also massive, as they obviously over sold tickets for this night. What a horrible experience. Needless to say we didn’t go park and went straight home, our night was completely ruined. Don’t believe we will come back and will let everyone we know about this horrible experience.",Cody F

10,READ before you buy tickets!,"Review from yelp...went to the Queen Mary last Friday and had such a bad experience. I was traveling from the San Fernando Valley after work during rush hour. Not only did it take me two hours to get there because of normal rush hour traffic, but it started raining on the way there so it caused us to spend more time on the road. There was a party of 6 of us, so we had already invested a lot of time planning our trip for a day we were all available, so naturally we checked the Dark Harbor website on that day because we saw there was a chance of rain, and under the FAQ, it clearly says that rain or shine, Dark harbor would be open. We were relieved since we were already over half way there and actually were looking forward to the fact that there probably wouldn't be many people there! We finally arrived and once off the freeway, we waited another 45 minutes to get to the event parking, and guess what? We went in, and went straight out. Dark harbor had closed. We were all extremely disappointed, and pretty upset since the website promised they would be open. We had wasted over 3 hours getting to the event only to see in person that it was cancelled. I hadn't been to the dark harbor in over 3 years and I was really excited to be going again and seeing all the new changes. My whole party was very disheartened so the next day, i reached out via email on the Queen marry website. On Monday, i called Dark Harbor to complain about this, and I was told that they can either refund my ticket(on site meaning I would have to drive all the way down there again) or I could come on another day. They were not empathic at all to the situation, and were pretty cold to be honest. I figured maybe it's just the rep, so I asked her to speak with a manager or someone who could help me. She transferred me to a VM for a man named Doug who was someone important regarding events. I called him and left a brief summary on the call and I asked him to call me back. That was on Monday and it is now Thursday. I have reached out to the Dark Harbor now via email through their website, via twitter, via Facebook, via phone, and now via Yelp. Please do right on your part DH.UPDATESo I just got a message on FB fromSomeone names ashley Patterson who said she read my review on Yelp and gave me a link for a refund. If you read it on yelp, why are you responding to me via FB? Oh, because I can't respond to you. I am ever more irritated then before. Well, here is my response to your FB message..... Hello! Thanks for reaching out. I would still like to attend the dark harbor but it's doesn't make me feel good as a consumer to know that all you are willing to do is give me my money back. I was hoping for a better experience overall while attending the event. Is there anything else you can do? Surely you have the means to offer upgraded tickets or something? We already lost money and time going the first time. I was hoping to receive something in addition to my general ticket and fast pass ticket I have already purchased as a way to compensate me and do good on your part",Amanda M
50,Back to the past,It was amazing visiting Queen Mary and having the tour inside the boat.You go back in time as you see the antiques inside the boat along with the restaurants and the ballrooms.It is highly recommended.You should also visit the Lady Diana museum inside the boat.,Traveling with scarf
30,"Interesting Attraction, Execution Could Be Improved","An interesting attraction with relatively engaging tours. Finding your way about (just into the main part of the visit) is difficult and confusing for no good reason (i.e. signage needs to be better and more modern).I’m not convinced the tourist element of it is a cohesive experience at all and its layout is like that of a temporary attraction. For the length of time the ship has been in Long Beach, it should be so much better, modernised (the visitor experience) and streamlined.I think overall it’s lost in between its functions as hote, attraction and venue. Not really worth the money, but nonetheless an interesting time spent aboard.",Ross Fulton
40,Scotland’s finest,"Fascinating trip back in time to the 30s. The 4D film was entertaining, the tour was informative and about right duration wise.Would definitely recommend if you’re in the area.",Duvetdancer

50,Fabulous!,"If you’re into elegance of days past then this is the place for you. We spent just about all of our time aboard ship, ghost hunting in the wee hours, walking on the promenade deck, exploring the beauty of this historical landmark. It gets into your blood, this stately ship, with its polished wood and nicely appointed staterooms. We booked king harbor view and kept the porthole windows open all night. The view was incredible morning, sundown and night time. Didn’t want to leave. Will return of that I’m sure",Kerry B
30,Dark Harbor,It was an absolute pain to get in! Running out of parking! Having to take the shuttle! The surprise parking fee! Would've been nice to know all that before hand! But well worth the wait! There is so much work put into it! The mazes were very scary and I loved the fact there was a lot of booze here and there to calm my nerves! The 4d movie was good just wish it were longer! We didn't partake in all of the mazes due to the long wait time. But we enjoyed the heck out of it!,JenV
20,Hard to get to and parking not so fun,Worth coming for a special event at same location but not the greatest for just seeing the ship. The construction right now makes it hard to reach and many of the freeways were closed this weekend.,timg742
50,Very interesting and informative.,"We used our Go Los Angeles cards to visit the Queen Mary and both really enjoyed it. It was so interesting and you get a choose of which guided tour you’d like to do. We chose the Glory Days one and our tour guide, Dustin, was extremely knowledgable with the best sense of humour.We could have spent longer looking round the ship but we had a boat trip booked for later in the day. I’d like to go back if I ever visit California again so I could do one of the other tours.The dark Harbor Halloween event looked good too!",Danielle R

Our tourguide Fernando was lovely! And took us all to the ship’s most haunted places and was very helpful throughout the entire tour. At the Wine Store on board you can sip on a variety of wines and even take some to go to sip while touring the ship (which we did!) If you’re ever in California this is a must!",imargaretburton

40,Not your typical hotel,"If you love history, this is the place for you. It's not a modern hotel room, but true to period for the Queen Mary. It's like stepping back in time. We enjoyed our stay and found it to be very relaxing. The restaurants were a bit expensive, so we took the free transit into Long Beach for our evening meals. Not much going on in the evenings, which was again very relaxing. Looking forward to returning soon.",Lora D
40,Pay extra for the tours,I would definitely recommend paying extra to do the guided tours. The ship is easy to navigate around on your own with the maps but you get no history there's a little bit of signage but not enough to really understand the history on this beautiful vessel. It would be great for you to have a self-guided audio tour to learn more about the history. It is one of the huge recommendations I would give to make this attraction better. We did the haunted tour Cody was our tour guide and he was fantastic. Without having that tour I would have rated this attraction lower. Many areas are now closed to the public do you still get a good taste with the original wood and other items still intact. They have a small coffee shop into restaurants on site check for hours. Parking is paid I'm not sure how much it costed because I did walk there. I would recommend being able to do stairs. There are a lot of stairs in the engine room you are able to use elevators to get to each floor but you're not able to really explore without being able to do those stairs. I would recommend checking out the Queen Mary and if you're able to do work tour with Cody I would definitely tell you to do it he was fantastic easy-to-understand and able to answer so many questions not just about the Paranormal Activity but about the ship in general,JulieBandSteveB
50,"Beware, you will learn something here!","As a World War II history buff, this ship has incredible an story. The personalities that have been on board, wow.

40,Plan to go with children,"It has a lot points of interest. The Queen Mary has played many roles throughout her ollustrious career, and upon her Maiden Voyage in 1936, she was considered the grandest ocean liner ever built. During her heyday, many considered her the only civilized way to travel. With the outbreak of World War II she was transformed into a troopship nicknamed ""The Grey Ghost"". By the end of the war she had transported more than 800.000 troops, traveled more than 600.000 miles and played a significant role in many major Allied campaigns. Retired in 1967, she was purchased by the City of Long Beach and has remained an icon of the city for over 50 years.",Yarde-Buller
10,Terrible experience,I went on a guided haunted tour with seven of my friends and was humiliated by your tour guide. Before we started the tour I asked if there would be a washroom along the way. Knowing with my condition I could not last 2 hours without needing a washroom break. The tour guide straight up said no. I was shocked but quickly used the washroom before starting hoping I’d be able to last. About 45 min in I realized I really needed to go and spotted the oportunity as there was a public washroom on the way to our next stop. I quickly popped in was gone for maybe 1 min and rejoined the group. When I joined back up the tour guide lost it on me saying I was holding up the tour. I said sorry I just needed to pee and couldn’t hold it. I asked if he would have rather I pissed my pants and he said yes then told me I had to leave the group he came towards me so I stepped out into the hall and he abruptly slammed the door in my face. One of the people I was with came out to help try to find a way off the ship. With no direction and no idea where we were we walked up stairs and down some stairs and just literally didn’t know how to get out. At one point I slipped on some water that was on the floor and bashed up my knee so badly it’s swollen badly bruised and sore to walk on. It took us about 30 min to find our way out. I found an employee and asked to speak to the manager. She was nice enough and offered to reimburse us but we had purchased our tickets online and the friend with the cc was still stuck on the tour. We have been calling to talk to her all day but she’s always “out of the office”. The tour guide wanted to deny me of a basic human necesity to pee and when I chose to do it he humiliated me in front of the whole group then kicked me off the tour . Leaving me lost. I’m so upset I left in tears and in pain from my fall. I hope that to get compensation for this immediately this was a gross negligence on behalf of our guide.,Krystin R
40,Worth a visit - but buy combo ticket and park in Long Beach,"Bought the Combo ticket with the USS Iowa - great value, but don't expect to do both on one day if you are going to do everything, We split it over two days.We parked in Lot 7 in Long Beach for $5 and jumped on the free Passport bus, which gave us a short tour of Long Beach as an added bonus.Its very confusing when you get there as there are a lot of building works etc. Fortunately there is this great big 3 funnelled ship to keep you from getting lost.The staff were very helpful. The Engine room is worth spending a good amount of time in. We did the Glory days tour which gives access to some first class areas not available on the self guided tour.All in all a good visit.Only bad point is that the British Union Flag was being flown upside down.",erinon312
50,An Amazing Lady,"Despite the improvements being made to this regal ship, the tours are fun and interesting. The Sir Winston Restaurant is a beautiful art deco room with GREAT food and an impressive wine list.",Fearless730216
40,Must do!,"My husband and I toured the Queen Mary and absolutely loved it! If you like history at all, this is a must do. However, we got a First Class Pass, which included the Glory Days tour (I would recommend taking this tour only, as it gives you the history of the ship and you’ll see below the other things weren’t worth the extra price), the Steam and Steel tour (takes you down below into what is now mostly empty equipment/boiler rooms, which was pretty useless, and the only part with equipment in it you can see by visiting the museum part), and a 4D theater which was a video showing the history of the ship which we already learned from Glory Days tour. I also paid $10 more to see the Churchill exhibit, after being told at ticket purchase it was included in my pass (but it wasn’t), but the extra $10 wasn’t worth it. I would pay for the Glory Days tour, see what you want on your own for free, and call it a day. But it was very much worth the experience and history learned in Glory Days tour.",SevyLevy
50,Fun place,Been here a few times. Once for New Years and had a blast!!! 2 years ago went for the Christmas celebration with the family. It was a lot fo fun doing that and walking aorund the Queen Mary. Spent the night twice. Nice little rooms. Lots of history to learn about!!!,RLHINCA
40,It’s iconic,"The Queen MARY is definitely something to see. Iconic! A piece of history. If you want to understand this era and what travel was like, make sure to see the Queen Mary.Sir Winston’s restaurant is very good!",MerleAsper
40,Great Experience,"Had 3 nights on the Queen Mary before moving on. We really enjoyed it. The decor is fading but to be fair it is an old ship and they can't really bring it into the 21st century otherwise it would lose it's character. Our only complaint, or rather my wife's was that our aircon was faulty and couldn't be adjusted. The room was freezing cold. It wasn't a problem to me as I don't feel the cold but it did bother my wife. The maintenance staff did try to sort it but couldn't. One selfish gripe from me is the fact that they had an amateur radio station onboard and radio hams can arrange to use it. I am a radio ham (G0RFQ) but didn't know about this until the day before we left. Gutted!! All in all it was well worth the visit and a fantastic experience.",Trawdener
50,Haunted Encounters Tour,"Took the Haunted Encounters tour on 15th September at 8pm. Our tour guide was Cody, he was absolutely passionate, patient and amazing! Will definitely recommend the tour, we had a great experience!",rachelle311
50,A Quicki stop before getting on Carnival,We enjoyed our visit the Queen Mary in Long Beach while staying at the Maya Hotel just a short walk away.,BigdogAZ2014
30,Enjoyed it but...,Ticket staff were not very helpful when explaining the ticket options so we went for the cheapest - entry plus one tour. We only really wanted to hop on and wander round but you have to do at least one tour. Our tour guide Tom was wonderful and we really enjoyed looking in some of the first class rooms with him. We then found it difficult to find our way round - the route marking wasn’t clear. But eventually we got to the engine rooms and the highlight was seeing the rudder that has been exposed in situ under the ship.,Karen C
40,Been 45 years since I was here still cool,As a kid I lived in Southern California and it was 45 years ago I was on the ship. The interesting thing is I was on it 55 years ago when it was a working ship and my grandma was sailing on her. I still remember the horn sounding to leave the ship.. and thought I was going to England from New York... that was when family members could board and say goodby. Well this is still a fun event. Have to say kind of expensive but I was here for meetings all week and arrived on a Sunday and it was a FUN afternoon. Parking 18.00 really?,Bob G
50,Amazing history and wonderful tours and exhibits,"We spend the day on the boat and took all the tours offered on a vip pass. With a small break for lunch. This was so very well worth the cost and time. Totally enjoyed every bit of history and information. We were treated to having one of the chefs on the passenger ship and also a passenger on the ship. Tours were so fun and informative, full of history and animated and friendly tour guides. Only one thing to mention, please bring a sweater or such it was very cold on the ship. Would recommend to stay the day and enjoy all the exhibits the ship has to offer. The Princess Di exhibit was extensive. Loved it!!!",Misssuzan
40,Walked around and ate lunch,"Pretty good, moderately expensive food, Nice Views, great Fun! This old boat is a very interesting trip.",J Peter W
30,Expwnsive grand old dame of the sea,If you like history or art deco this is a long beach must see. Truly an amazing piece of history that has been preserved. But leave the kids at home if they are not interested... tours are pretty slow and quit frankly I think it is way overpriced. So waste of money if you are not really into it.,Kristin B
40,Like an older hotel,"Booked two nights stay in window suite. The room is large, clean with king size bed night stands and small table with chairs. The bathroom has a small tub and no plug. The ship overall needs attention to detail like carpet and renovations to accurate time period.",Kim G
50,Outstanding.,"A trip back in time to regal first class travel. This ship exudes pure quality and you can't help imagine what it was like to sail on her in her prime. Our tour guide was very informative and put his own personal touch into the tour. Well done James !! We has drinks in the bar overlooking long beach on a glorious day. This old lady is well worth a visit, it's history may well surprise you with the facts revealed.",andrew p
50,WHY STAY IN A HOTEL WHEN YOU CAN SLEEP ON THE QUEEN MARY?,"We had so much fun, we rented two cabins, my daughters actually had a "" suite"" ! it was like going back in time in the 40 ""s, the boat is the same at it was, you feel you are on a cruise and part of the boats. we stayed for 3 nights and had a lot of fun.the only negative point would be the very expensive parking price per day which was a bad surprise on the bill, I think it should be free for guests who stay more than one night.i wish they would open the original pool again :)",LAURENTBO19
50,We Loved visiting the Queen Marry.,"This is a must see for history buffs. The ship 🚢 is amazing with so many things to see and do. My daughters and I caught the Charles dickens ice sculpture event and that was quite the winter wonderland theat was created inside the pavilion next to the ship and in the village area they even had ice seating,",Kelley D
30,Disappointed,- I was expecting to see some original rooms from when the ship was sailing but there is none of this and original dining rooms ect. If your expecting this don’t bother visiting- There is not a lot to see on the ship I think it’s more of a hotel not for looking at this ship- Was good to take a few cool photos,Eat Fly Sleep Repeat
30,Great ship and story but poor coordination of tours,"We, as a family of 5, decided to tour the QM. Lots of history on this grand old ship and we looked forward to hearing and seeing it. This is not an inexpensive attraction. Each adult price with our tour selection was $37. Parking (which isn't cheap either, $18 per auto or $8 with restaurant validation, but the validation is for 3 hours only) is available but somewhat limited when the crowds are there.The ship is old and the weather decks are in a state of deterioration and ongoing repair. The main deck provided a great view of LB harbor and the city. We walked around below deck, self-guiding ourselves with the aid of the free ship pamphlet. Be advised: there is a lot of walking and negotiating stairways required to see the ship. The engineering spaces were impressive although some areas were very dirty and, as usual, some people just cannot stop discarding their water bottles, paper wrappers and other trash around the ship. Still, we did enjoy the pumps, turbines and supporting motors and steam generators.There isn't a ""just tour the ship"" option that we could find; each guided tour, presentation, or exhibit is a separate cost. We were scheduled for a complete ship tour which, as we were waiting in the Starboard Bar, was unceremoniously canceled. We did receive notice from a polite staff member who offered us the engine room tour or the Haunted tour. Since we had already self-toured the engineering spaces, we opted for the ghost stories tour.Our tour guide was well informed, polite and explained his points well. It just wasn't that interesting to us and midway through the tour, we got herded out to the main lobby due to a fire alarm. The alarm was a false one but the tour was cut short and wrapped up shortly thereafter. Also adding to the confusion and area access by the public was a filming crew onboard shooting a segment of ""SWAT"". We were not informed of this filming effort prior to purchasing our tours.As part of our purchase we also toured the display where the British cabinet and Churchill stayed underground in London during the blitz. There were also displays on the QM's numerous journeys around the world during WWII. We watched a short movie on aspects of the darkest hours of the early part of the war where Britain was under constant bombing by the Germans.The QM restaurants and bars are very expensive, even by CA standards. My single cocktail in the Starboard Bar was $12. Two glasses of champagne were $20. The hotel area of the ship was relatively clean and well kept. I can see the attraction of wanting to stay in one of the staterooms for an extended stay; it is indeed a unique hotel.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed at the attraction's pricing and disjointed coordination. But we improvised, overcame, adapted and did what we came to do. I will not say the QM shouldn't be part of your LB area fun, but I can't really rave about going there either.",lonestarlizard
50,Awesome experience,"My dad was on the Queen Mary in WW2 so seeing it was especially neat for me. The ghost tour was a really cool tour, you learn a lot about the folks who died while onboard. The first room they assigned us to stay in had no working a/c due to construction, but when we told the front desk that it wasn’t going to work for us they quickly gave us a complementary upgrade. The rooms aren’t soundproof at all so pack earplugs or something for white noise if that’s a problem for you. It’s definitely something to see, even if you choose not to spend the night.",SueA59
40,Neglected glory,"We stayed on the Queen Mary for our anniversary. In the morning, we went all over the ship from top to bottom. The less-visited decks of the ship show bad signs of decay - rust near the infirmary, decking rotting through, and some areas so damaged they are closed off - but the more-visited interior areas are richly appointed.We took one of the ghost tours and were very entertained; we also went down to the engine room for a good look around. It's a great ship, but definitely needs TLC.",snowythepyro
30,the ship,"to expensive for go in to explored the ship, we just taking some picture from ouside, around for awhile, and 18$ for parking an half hour",liarosse
40,A really nice old ship,We just looked at Queen Mary from the outside byt it was worth it. It´s really big and look really nice. There is also an old submarine next to the ship. There is free parking outside the ship for 30 minuters.,Karin S
50,Princess Diana Tour is a must,"My husband and I were married in the Chapel here in 2002 & we decided to come back whilst visiting California with our 15 year old this year.Unfortunately for is there was filming taking place on the day of our visit and we could t get to see the Observation Bar where we had our after wedding drinks and the chapel was cordoned off but I absolutely loved the Princess Diana self guided tour.I would recommend a guided tour to find out more about the history of this amazing ship but we didn’t book in advance, hence opting for the self guided tour.Very educational and for us obviously a very special place in our hearts.",Gill2602
50,Great Adventure!!!,"We took the 9:30PM tour and thoroughly enjoyed the adventure! The cost was $44 per person and the tour lasts two hours. We took along our 12 year old daughter who enjoyed it as well. Nothing too spooky for her but if you're going to bring your young child, be prepared for two hours of walking and entering some dark, dark creepy places. The didn't just focus on the hauntings but also the history of the ship. Our guide, ""Matt"" was very informative and seemed to genuinely care about the ship and her history.Did we see any ghosts? No, but there is definitely a presence felt in each haunted area we were taken to. (some more than others) We literally had a feeling of nausea and dizzyness overcome us in two areas in particular. (The engine and boiler rooms). Overall, it was a great adventure and a great opportunity to explore the ship's most inner secrets. I recommend booking a room (which we did and recorded flying orbs) and having dinner at the Chowder Bar before your the tour. We enjoyed every aspect of this mini-getaway!",Lisa M
50,Very Fun,You learn a lot of history going through the tour. It was pretty cool to feel like you were reliving an era. We did the package deal with the Aquarium.,Cindy S
40,Must visit,Queen Marry is a staple ol Long Beach’s turístico places must see. It is not free not even to get in and walk around. Expect to pay about $25.00 for one visit,Roberto M
50,Must see!,This boat is amazing! It even has rooms because it is also a hotel. Parkin is convenient and the area is fun to explore.,Josh B
40,"Such an interesting place to go, alot of history","If you love history this is the place to go, it is so grand and you feel like you have taken a step back in time. It is a bit pricey to get in and yes the price you pay is just for the ship, sorry. They do have a lot of things to see but they do charge you for everything usually, they have tours, exhibits, Halloween events, Easter, Winter, concerts on the grounds, conventions, etc. So all in all if you have the dough, its a nice place but if you don't you can pay for parking and just walk the grounds and take pictures, that's still cool",Maria A
20,Disappointed,"We went to Queen Mary, thinking we could go inside and eat lunch. Someone had told us we could do that. When we got there we ask to go into the restaurant. There was a charge of $30 or more just to go on board and then cost of food. We quickly decided we would skip the meal and seeing the interior of the ship. Enjoyed seeing the famous ship, but I cannot recommend the attraction.",Bill B
40,Fun & interesting,"A must see if you’re in Long Beach. If you like old movies, old houses, you’ll love walking around this old restored ship. Saw Princess Diana exhibit, tons of royal history, ephemera & clothes.",karen19752016
40,Paranormal Walk,We took my 16 year old niece and we all enjoyed the Paranormal Walk. We had Daniel leading the tour and he was funny and very informative. It was a lot of walking but we saw parts of the ship that were creepy even without the stories. Honesty there were places that just felt scary; like someone is watching you. I wish we could have seen the pool area but the boiler and engine rooms were AWESOME!,rubydevora
20,Not worth ot,"Came into this optimistic and interested in the history. Left disappointed. Signage is poor. Information for self guiding (no audio guide) is deficient. Parts under renovation which was not made clear up front. Very expensive for what you get. Parking also annoyingly pricy - $18 in addition to $35 for the admission. The parts that we could see were well preserved. If you really love old ships and the history maybe consider it, otherwise, meh.",Erin W
40,Different type of stay,"We stayed in a room (cabin) with 2 queen beds along with our 3 children (11,14 and 16). Luckily they get along together as it was pretty tight!The rooms are clean and spacious with decent facilities. The boat overall is a little tired looking but it is pretty old and the outside has just had a fresh lick of paint.The staff were very accommodating at looking after our bags after we checked out and wanted to explore Long Beach (there’s a free bus service that stops outside the Queen Mary)",Al-ban5
50,Surprise Opportunity,"On impulse, my Conference Mate and I decided to walk the short distance from out hotel to the Queen Mary to explore. We were treated to a very educational and beautiful tour. This ended up being an unexpected highlight of our time in Long Beach.",Bonnie H
40,Piece of history,Nice afternoon learning about history and the area. The area is nice to take a stroll and catch a bite to eat.,annapN7702ZW
50,Historic & Ghost Tours,We learned a very interesting history of The Queen Mary and all of the ghosts that are supposed to haunt the ship. The Historic Tour was very informative and the Haunted Encounters Tour was lots of fun. Will have to go back sometime to take the Paranormal Investigations Encounter on a weekend night.,sfsmith1
40,HUGE,I have been here before but I forgot just how immense the ship is. Food is fairly decent and nights on the deck are beautiful.,AdventureWriterMN
30,Not what I expected.,"We bought tickets for just the Glory Days tour online, as we had a grand child with limited attention span. The size of the ship is always impressive and the models of the ships were interesting. Our tour leader did his best to provided details of the ship's glory days, which probably wouldn't mean much to the younger crowd. In fact, I think most youngsters would find it boring. We visited a limited portion of the ship. I was expecting some cabins, the kitchen the bridge, etc .On our own we saw a movie that was interesting, and, of course, if we had taken more tours we would have seen more.",CalifCar
10,Queen Mary lost its beauty,"The offer online was very attractive but the reality is other ! The people at the Restaurant are very busy and do not take care of you at all, the food was regular and also no choice of table if you are going there alone. the visit on board is very poor and no one is available to guide you if you want to do a tour by your own. The beauty of the ship has been lost and I am very sad to see how this ship had become after years, I mean by that that everything looks like they are not very taking care of the jewel. Staff are busy and not friendly at all. The Diana Exposition is a very poor one and so disappointed. They really have to make this ship looks like it used to and not taking this attraction as only get your money for nothing !I do not recomendado that visit at all.",ginebrino123
40,Haunted Encounters Tour best part of visit,"Arrived at the dock ship entrance and it was confusing- no signs to find out where to go. Asked an employee and were directed up to fourth floor lobby.Once in lobby, again no signs directing tour traffic. Popped into one of the shops and asked where we should go for our tour tickets.Found the tour office, really not impressed with the folks working there. They were not helpful at all, and quite curt with me. Didn't even offer us a map so we were looking elsewhere for them. Turns out they had them all along, under the counter. Wasted a lot of time without a map, wandering and not knowing where we were.Thankfully we also booked the Haunted Encounters tour which was excellent. Sean was a fantastic guide, and really brought the stories and history of the ship alive. If it weren't for the Haunted Encounters tour we would have been pretty disappointed with our visit.We had purchased the Queen Mary/USS Iowa combination ticket, and when we arrived at the USS Iowa we found out that the tour office employees on the Queen Mary neglected to give us the tickets for the USS Iowa as they were supposed to do when we checked in there. Thankfully the USS Iowa ticket office let us pass.",gypsymamma
50,Spellbinding Tour Guide James,"Queen Mary is a great visit - or repeat visit. I highly recommend for both locals and visitors. BUT you can read all about that on other people's reviews. What I want to focus on here is JAMES - truly the BEST tour guide my family and I have ever experienced in our lives.We took a Queen Mary tour with James five years ago and we remembered it and him so well that we made sure to find out which tour he was giving and when - when we decided to return to the Queen Mary for another visit. This time we did the Glory Days Tour --- and once again, we were amazed by how captivating, inclusive, knowledgeable, and inspiring James is. Our group happened to include several folks with accessibility needs and James made sure they were met in a seamless and inclusive manner. It's hard to explain how and why his tours are so different from other guides - who are also good but no match in comparison to James. He uses his voice and hands to draw you in. I watched passersby stop and actually walk backwards in order to catch a few words of what he was saying. Also, our group ranged in age from 13 to 58 - and we all loved him.Here are some quotes from our group:""Super engaging and inclusive with everybody on the tour. Dedicated to making sure people learn and have a fun, positive experience.""""When he gives the tour, he makes it sound like he's giving it for the first time - like it still excites him.""""The best part is the way he presents himself.""""He uses theatricality, knowledge, and timing to draw you in and hold your attention.""",Cyntravelz
30,The Queen Mary Tours are OK,"The Queen Mary is amazing - size, technology for the era in which it was built and elegance in the first class area. The history is very interesting, especially that it was also a WWII troop transport carrying thousands of soldiers from the world to the war theaters in Europe and Asia. Quite a varied history. We bought the Grand Passport tickets package, included Glory Days, Haunted Encounters, Princess Diana Exhibit, Their Finest Hours (Churchill Exhibit). There was the Cunard line exhibit and the Queen Mary in Legos. The most interesting was the Glory Days. The guide was interesting and told a very good story of the QM. The Haunted Encounter just walked around and told stories about something that might have happened, sometime. Princess Diana had a few clothes, some memorabilia from Charles and his family. Not very interesting. The engine room was amazing. The size of the engines! WOW!The ship is under repair and it needs it. They finally received funding to fix it up.The restaurants are not worth the time. The best place, was the little market that serves Starbucks.",Begonia33
50,Adventure on The Mary,"Wow- what a sight! The Queen Mary offered free walk around after 6 pm. What we saw were mini model replicas of the ship’s design, historic photos and memorabilia of what items were used during its peak, the grand foyer, and scenic views. A mixed feeling of amazement with mystery due to its possible haunted history. Amazed that people can stay overnight and used as wedding locations! Great experience for the family!",andrealara1212
40,Must-see,"The Queen Mary offers different tours. It’s pricey, but there’s a lot to see and learn. We’ve spend hours on this ship.It may be a disappointment to some that the ship is not completely decorated.",Natascha F
50,More than just a cruise ship,There is for the tour part of the ship. There is also a hotel and restaurants available on site. There are many options for you to chose for your tour. You start with the basic tour and you add in the special attractions.As you was around the ship make sure you walk up and different decks. Even the hotel floors have things to see. You can also make your way outside and around the ship on other decks.Then make your way down to the engine room. This part keeps you going down winding thru the engine room. You will find yourself at two escalators that look like they have not been used in years. Take them up 2 flights and you will be able to venture outside the ship below the water line to view a propeller.We added on the Churchill exhibit which we learned more about the boat I had ever know.This is a must see in Long Beach.,Jeff D
30,Disappointment,"We spent on the ship for 1 night. The room was in the original style, but we could not sleep because it was cold in the room due to the strong air conditioning without the possibility of in-room control. The restaurant where the dinner was served was unassuming, no wooden trim on the walls, but cold white tiles. Breakfast is not included in the room rate.",Simonik169
50,Great piece of history with a haunted past,Great blast from the way past. You can choose to take two different types of tours of this ship. The history tour or the haunted tour. I’ve done both and well worth it. You can even spend the night on the ship as it is also a hotel. Great price when you combine tickets with Aquarium of the Pacific. Location is close to both and there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Great way to learn about the past and the way of life back then. Awesome vacation spot,Darin F
40,Family Tourist Visit,"Visited the Queen Mary in July with husband and 2 teen daughters. We bought tickets with combo pass of the aquarium of the pacific which we toured first. We arrived at the Queen Mary around 1pm and it was a little confusing. We were told to get in line at the ticket booth which did not make sense because we had our tickets. Apparently you need to pick which tour you want to participate in. We chose the haunted tour which wasn’t available until 3pm. We were able to tour the boat on our own and watch a 4D movie. There were two movies playing but it wasn’t clear if we could watch both or just one as the ticket lady marked all our tickets as having watched the 4D movie. The movie was good. We toured the engine room on our own but didn’t know much about what we were viewing. Gave up and went to the upper deck which meant leaving the boat , going outside to an elevator and traveling up to another floor. Another desk ticket person greeted us and checked off our tickets which I had no idea what that meant. Not sure if we were allowed to come back or once you leave an area your done. Anyway we checked out the promenade and observatory bar, also saw LEGO replica of the boat, saw titanic and Queen mary wooden replica which were cool. Lastly went on the haunted tour which our group was huge. At least 35 with young kids. The tour was OK. Basically just went to some areas on the boat and told stories of possible happenings with ghosts. The tour guide spoke as if he told the stories a hundred times. Kinda monotone. He did his little jokes to be funny but just didn’t seem genuine mostly like reading from a script. The young kids were bored half way thru and ended up talking a lot even when the guide was talking which made it hard to hear at times. Overall average tour and would have liked it better with a small group without kids who get bored easily. The Queen mary is cool in itself but really wished we would have did the classic history tour since we don’t know much about it. Will go back at some point in my life time and worth the visit.",Heather S
30,A little Underwhelmed,"Was a bit less exciting than expected. wanted to see more of the ship on the tours or have open doors to places we can explore on our own or see. Glad I went and the full package is definitely work the $ for a one-time is it but I wanted more of ""what is was like when . . . "" Should have a hotel guest room as part of the tour to see what standard guests stayed in while crossing the ocean. Have an unused ballroom set up so we can image the parties, etc. The haunted tour was lame - might of been the guide but the stories were not relatable when you're not in the room or the place it happens - which was 1/2 of the tour. Exhibits were nice to see and view at our leisure. Lunch in the Cafe was ok. Glad I went but won't go back - it's kinda a one trick pony!",290penny
50,An interesting look at the past,Really enjoyed glimpsing into the history of travel. The guides were well informed and enthusiastic. Renovation work is taking place on board.GoLA card only covers entry and one of the tours. It is $10 each for the other 3 tours/exhibitions so could work out expensive fir a family.,Judith v
50,Lots Of History,We visited July 7. We went on a tour of the boat. Saw many parts of the ship very glad we toured.We watched the movie that was on the top deck told stories from actual people who were on her during the war and also she took back to states war brides.There is a room that was Winston Churchills as he rode on her many times.Would recommend,dapmag3
30,Run down and musty,Came here for a reception. Views are pretty but the food was not great. The outside decks were fine but the ship's interior needs a major facelift. Historical should only really go so far!,MABM917
50,Awesome restaurant vrnue,Didn’t do the tour but dined in the restaurant. Top quality food. Fine dining. Outstanding service. Very unique vista. Do special occasions here!,anagorski
40,Interesting History,"After wandering around the vast ship, which housed at one point, over 16,000 military personnel during the Second World War, we took a guided tour and discovered we have missed many areas and stories. There was much fine wood, about 12 species, some of which are extinct. The preservation of the entire ship, which is still floating, is impressive. The engine room and the still functioning original observation lounge should not be missed. The ship is next door to the Carnival Cruise ship terminal, and in addition to the cruise business, there seems to be weddings and conventions going on. Despite the many events happening at the same time, we did not feel crowded. We did not stay in the hotel.",LG964
40,The Real Glam,"My family and I visited The Queen Mary on our drive from LA to San Diego. Being from Boston we are always interested in having at least one historical learning experience while on vacation. For us, this was it. We, also, are not a family who reads every plaque and looks at every picture while touring a museum or landmark. The Queen Mary offered a unique view of what Transatlantic travel used to be like for the rich and famous. Our guide, Daniel (aka Tiffany), moved us along and imparted much information and insight during the tour. We did the shortest tour which took us about 2 hours. There are longer versions which are more expensive, but probably not necessary. I think history buffs would LOVE this ship and for those who would like to pretend they are royalty or Hollywood stars for a few hours - this tour is for you!",Noreen S
50,The ship is,Now in very good shape. I really wish they still made cruise ships like this! The cost of admission is a little high and the parking should be free.,DrCraigD
20,Fourth of July,"I made a hotel reservation for my friend and I to stay on the Queen Mary for the evening of July 4th. While speaking with the reservation agent, I specifically asked if there would be people on board after 6PM other than hotel guests. I was told ""no"". Our first clue that wasn't the case came when we had to wait 45 minutes to park the car. We finally embarked, checked in, and went to our room all the while maneuvering around hordes of people. We got to our room, dropped our bags, and went to make a dinner reservation. The room itself was very quaint with polished wood everywhere. My traveling companion was delighted with the room and remarked ""It's much larger than I expected."" Anyway, when we attempted to make a dinner reservation, the only time available was during the firework display. No space had been set aside for hotel guests. We picked up a sandwich at one of the kiosks set up for the event after a 15 minute wait. In an attempt to escape the crowds, we thought we would visit an exhibition. Nope, that was an extra charge. Later we attempted to find a place to view the fireworks. None were available. Again, nothing had been set aside for hotel guests. Spying two ship's officers, I explained our dilemma. I was told that tickets are sold to board the ship for the day and fireworks only (direct contradiction to what the reservation agent had told me). One of the officers said that July 4th and New Year's Eve are the biggest money makers for the ship. The officers led us to a place on the steps so we could view the fireworks and gave us a voucher for a free breakfast. I thought the fireworks were spectacular (even though rock and roll music played through half the display). The next morning we went to brunch which was delicious. The atmosphere was serene, calm; a throughly enjoyable ending to an otherwise very stressful stay. My advice: if you have children save some money and buy tickets for the day only. Bring ear plugs for the little ones; the music is constantly blaring. Keep a close eye on them cause in the hordes of people and chaos, the could get away from you.",Joy S
30,Pricey!,"Pros: a good way to kill three hours, friendly staff, interesting historical information, a Starbucks on board, beautiful views of the ocean and Long BeachCons: expensive ($37 per person, $18 for parking, $4 for a bottle of water), the ship is not in excellent condition as there are several areas of disrepair",Julia G
30,The Queen Mary,"The Queen has seen better days. The City was remiss in allowing every operator to slack off on maintenance issues. It's a historical ship but needs about 250 million in repair work. At Sir Winstons, the food was good but on the expensive side. I have not stayed at the hotel so I won't comment on that. Take the tour, visit the active wireless radio room and watch out for the ghosts and see pictures of her in her WWII dressing and be thankful for her historic past.",BobandMargie G
10,The queen needs a lot of TLC as we say in the Real Estate Business,"We were there with a bit family group for a wedding. We stayed 2 nights most of our party stayed 3. Our room had lots of large paint chips on the bathtub and the drain area was so rusted I was afraid to put any weight near it for fear my foot could go through. The tub leaked onto the floor and the toilet flushed with a foot pedal that did not shut off unless you reached down with your hand and pulled it up. It was broken. The sink faucet was also very loose and hard to keep a consistant temperature. Lots of rust at the back of the toilet too, so again some concern there. The bed was OK, the furniture old and in disrepair. Windows didn't open and one was badly chipped. The place was also dirty and dusty. No excuse for that. I put pants and shorts on two different shelves and both came back dusty or dirty (white and black pants of course), We were in several other rooms including a grand suite for my sister-in-law and one the bride and groom got for their wedding night along with several mini suites. All were in the same state. Needed new carpets, bedding, furniture (chairs or couches), Tables were from the era but not taken care of so were cracked or just dirty looking. The wedding was in the back on the decks. Nice view, but just benches to sit on they covered. The deck getting back there had several loose boards and holes in boards that could have caused someone in heals not looking to stumble. I was quite surprised they didn't have them marked off (but there are a lot of them) or make us go another direction if there was one we could have taken. The bar area also needed cleanup and updating and a better bar tender. The dining room was in the best shape of any part of the ship, but then it probably had to be to be allowed to serve food. The food was average and the breakfast bar was lacking in enough room to allow good flow for patrons to serve themselves. They also had only one waffle maker so the line got quite long for it. They also do tours all day long so you are constantly getting groups of people through so you can't sit and relax on the deck or do a workout without feeling like you are in a fishbowl. It's one thing to preserve the nostalgia of the old girl but you can do so with decor and not have dilapidated furniture that looks like it came from Craigslist to furnish my son's first dorm room! TO bad they let her get in such disrepair. I don't see how they can charge as much as they do for rooms. I would rather stay at a Motel 6 than here again.",Cindy H
40,Checked Off Another Haunted Site!,"This place had been on my haunted places bucket list for a long time. My husband and I got the opportunity to come take a tour because we happened to be in town for a wedding one weekend. We only had enough time in the morning to take the Haunted Encounters tour before we had to rush back and change for the wedding.Our tour guide was so nice and a great storyteller (Rupert or Robert?). I felt bad for him because we had a family that brought an infant on the tour that he had to talk over as well as some people he had to talk over in various areas that weren’t in our group. You shouldn’t be allowed to take babies on this tour because they can’t possibly get anything from it, it takes away from our experience trying to hear him over your child, and there is a very difficult staircase that you navigate on the tour to the Cargo Hold that didn’t seem very safe to handle with a baby in your arms.Anyway, the tour is just under an hour and you get to see all different kinds of areas of the ship. I think it’s a good mash up of haunted stories, history, and presentation of the boat all in one so you get a little flavor of everything. After the tour you are free to roam the ship which I wish we had had the time to do. The tour feels like it just scratches the surface of this giant ship, so definitely leave time to explore on your own. The ghost stories were interesting but I was bummed not to experience anything while on the tour or capture any orbs or shadow figures, etc on camera. I definitely needed more time on the boat to really let the place sink in. My husband wants to come back to stay the night which would be a great way to really experience anything paranormal. I think I might have to work up the nerve though after the stories from the tour.",Christine S
50,A Piece of History,"The last time I was in Long Beach, I only saw the Queen Mary from afar. This time around, I actually paid the entrance fee and went aboard. I knew the ship was from the ""old days"" when sailing was (mostly) for the wealthy, so I was expecting to be a bit dazzled...I wasn't disappointed. The ship is decorated in the (then popular) Art Deco style, with gorgeous wood everywhere. The ship currently also functions as a hotel, so the three decks with cabins are off-limits to the general public, but there is still lots to see. One interesting aspect is that the Engine Room (which, of course, no one is allowed to see on a functioning cruise ship) has been turned into a space that one can walk through and see all of the original equipment ""up close and personal."" Signs at various points tell what one is looking at. An interesting item along the way is the quick walk that takes one outside the hull of the ship to look down at the only still-attached propeller (there were originally four) in a special tank. There are several tiers of ticket prices available; we took the ""basic"" level, which got us entry plus one special exhibit. We chose the Diana (as in Princess Diana) one. We were there for almost three hours and had to leave to get to our next destination, but were still unable to finish everything there is to see. There are guided tours available (I believe one pays more for these), but we felt we were able to take in most of the ship on our own. I'm sure the guided tour(s) fills in many aspects of the history of the ship, so folks who enjoy that will probably want to check that out.",Kurt M
50,Very Interesting Attraction,We visited the Queen Mary as a last minute stop off on the way to the airport. We joined a organised tour and it was fascinating to learn about the history of the great Ocean Liner. It is well worth a visit to look around this piece of Maritime history. If you can make time for this attraction. Great food in the cafe too.,COsbpcat
40,Guided Tour was great!!,"I've always seen the Queen Mary, but never knew its history, or toured it. We did the guided tour as for me if left to explore by myself I don't understand what I'm looking at, or miss all the information provided by the guide, My only complaint was that to get to tour the engine room you have to climb stairs up, walk, and climb down, which we have trouble doing, so we were directed to walk in the parking lot to the engine room, but the gate was locked, and we couldn't get the attendant's attention about 100 ft. away, Finally some workers saw us and opened the gate,",quasimoto559
50,Nostalgic Day Out,"Went for the day to see the ship and the Diana Tour. Easy to get to the location, parking was a bit tricky as the access road was closed due to road works so had to navigate through a no entry sign. Ship was better than I expected, engine room was quite special and the Observation Lounge was great for a drink and relax. Thought the Diana exhibition was a bit of a let down, as 80% the other royals. We selected this option with our ticket rather than the tour. In hindsight maybe the tour would have been better or an upgrade to our ticket to include both, there a gain all these places have a great way of getting money from you. Recommended",Laurel_265
40,Back in history,It’s a nice place to spend around 4 hours during your visit to Long beach. Very historic place but it’s recommended to take a guided tour to get all the information needed.,Jenan2000
50,Do not miss!,"One of the most relaxing places in southern California. This ship is beautiful, if only todays cruise ships had this much style and elegance.",tinaanddave2016
50,Recomeded,"I Read some reviews say it's free after six pm. This is probably true but if you come after six alot of the exhibit is closed. The engine room can only be seen before 6 and the 3D theater will be closed. The tour is 3 to 4 hours and definitely worth the money. After adding up the price of our tickets,If I would have had more time I probably would have just rented a suite and stay the night we could have explored the ship all day long and got to see everything for about the same price. The crew was very friendly and my family had a great time.",Steven S
50,A must see!,"This is the second time I've been on the ship, once when I was in jr. high the other at the end of June. The ship itself is beautiful and the history behind her is captivating. I love the old feel along with the elegance of the wood paneling and brass. It takes you back in time. We tried to stay here overnight but had too many in our party. There are a few tours to choose from that cost money such as the Ghost Tour and the Princess Diana but are well worth the money. We took the Diana exhibit and were shocked at the size of the collection which included dresses, pictures, hand written cards, photos , news articles, and other memorabilia. The are plenty of free tours as well as you can go up on deck or down in the engine room which was my favorite. OH! If you are taking a cruise on Carnival or another cruise ship then you can get in for free and get discounts on the tours as well. Don't miss your chance to take in a piece of history!",Rivvv2003
50,Great place to take visitors,This is a really great attraction to take visitors too. I loved learning the history of the ship. I took the history tour and the ghost tour- really enjoyed both. Just an FYI- it's lots of walking and lots of stairs.,pbj416
50,Checked off the bucket list!,"This is definitely the place for history lovers! We were driving through and decided to stopped and glad we did. We even got to look at a few rooms and picked the room that would work best for our family. The front desk was kind and helpful. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you are looking for posh stuff. It's a historical ship and is very old. That's the draw to the ship! We had fun exploring it and did the ghost tour on board. The tour is worth the money and was excellent! So much history and mystery behind the ship. We went in June and the weather was nice and cool and we opened our porthole and that kept us nice and comfortable. Service was sometimes slow on the ship but it made you slow down to enjoy what was around you. The hotel was a little overprice with the amenity fee, and parking fee. The rooms were old and tired looking but we can say we've stayed on the Queen Mary. Again, I would recommend it, if you are in for an adventure. I don't recommend it to people that are use to or wanting a Ritz Carlton or Waldorf hotel stay.",Floridatourist17
40,Fun,It is a nice place to visit walk around the chip see historic things not a place for the whole day I recommend 2-3 hours for this place,Tamer Henen
50,Historic,Fantastic piece of maritime history all in one place. Im sure the local Hollywood directors could amke a brilliant film about the story of this boat. A little expensive to visit at 32 dollars for a basic tour and access but it was worth it.,Paul C
10,FALSE ADVERTISING ON FOURTH OF JULY PACKAGE,"My wife and I,because I just had recent open heart surgery, wanted to do something that would be seamless for the 4th, and would provide reserved seating to the handicapped. Expense was not an issue.We bought the Queen Mary Hotels ""VIP Package"" for the 4th, which was to include our room, admission to all special parties, ""Welcome"" Champagne with hat and most importantly reserved seating, on the ""top deck"" for handicapped and VIP persons.There was no Top deck special seating and the 6' x 6' area marked ""ADA"" had 12 persons jammed inside, with NO SEATS ANYWHERE ! We had to stand with 12 people, one in a wheelchair, for over 2 hours in order to get a partially obstructed view of the fireworks.We paid over $250 for VIP treatment and got nothing in return.The Queen Mary and it's Management should be ashamed of their lack of treatment they showed to handicapped persons. Other than meeting ADA code by having its locations printed on the ships map, once the crowd started to form, there was NO management by QM personnel of these areas.I can only hope that someone more powerful than me, was offended yesterday and will hold the QM's managements feet to the fire on this matter.",RPVWilly
50,Free after 6 pm!!,We are staying at the Hotel 300 yards down but walked over after dinner since it was free. We were able to see some of Princess Diana exhibit walk around the top two desk and had some spectacular views of the Long Beach shoreline.,Samantha M
30,Always Fun and great Drinks,"Well worth a stop in for a drink when in Long Beach! Grew up there and have visited the boat for various reasons. Ghost tours, overnights, brunch, haunted house and just to get a drink!",Leanne J
40,Great bit of history and entertaining.,A last minute decision to take a look at the Queen Mary turned into a fun afternoon and dinner. From the history on the boat itself. The views over the water. The historic sections and information all over. Its actually quite impressive. Over 70 years old and now docked with a well priced and fully functional hotel on this old lady. Different restaurants catering from light snacks to full meals. A museum with actual titanic artefacts. Other interesting stops on the varuous decks on the boat. Also staff were very friendly and helpful from parking to waiting staff. Going after 6pm although some of the features are closed you save around $35 to $45 On entry as it's free after 6pm. Easy to get to with ample parking while we were there. Happy hour specials as well on offer. Even a good old ghost tour for those keen.,Grant S
50,Travel Back in Time,"Travel back in time aboard the Queen... I took a couple of tours and loved the information and showing of the general layout - then I wondered around like I owned the ship. The best self-tour is through the engine room in the bowels of the ship. It was amazing to go back in time and feel the majesty of the steel around you. One of the most haunted places on earth, it's a pretty fun outing. Check groupon first to save a little.",mafjord
30,Interesting but not a must do,I was on a business trip in the area and decided to pop over on a Thursday evening. Ship is interesting to walk through. We had drinks at the ship in a period style lounge. As expected- everything is old but it looked more shabby than antique. Drinks were good and reasonable. We toured for a bit on our own for about an hour. Good tip- if you go after 6pm admission is free. The on board shops close early but there are a couple restaurants open late. Neat to see but doubt I would go again. Hope that helps.,Lorie R
40,Definitely worth seeing and touring (self-guided option too),"The Queen Mary has a long and interesting history, so this is worth the stop and ticket fee for any maritime folks, history lovers, or the genuinely curious. The design style echoes back half a century and therefore provides a very ""retro"" feel as you wander about the ship. In permanent docking, it has become a hotel with some shops and restaurants too, though these are all Queen Mary specific options (don't think of chains or larger retailers). Part of purchasing a ticket includes a guided tour, which seemed like it could have been good (we opted not to do it). I'd put the price, both of the ticket and shops/restaurants, is comparable to a $$-$$$ ranking depending on how thrifty you are. We got aquarium tickets included (an option).",Patrick A

40,Grand old lady,"I toured the Queen Mary this week and it was nice to see something that was once considered so grand. I bought the upgrade ticket to see the Princess Diana gowns but was pleasantly surprised that there was so much more than the gowns.

50,AMAZING SHIP WITH ITS HISTORY,"If you ever make it to SoCal please be sure to come to Long Beach to the Queen Mary and visit this historic ship. Winston Churchill stayed here as well as many many others. I was able to witness when the QM2 arrived a few yrs ago, that was an awesome moment too. I highly recommend visiting!!",anne M
50,The Queen Mary never disappoints. Plus the food and view at the top is great.,"My second time at The Queen Mary and it's always a nice trip.The tour gives you a good peek of an era long gone but not forgotten, its history and how it looks and feels inside including the engine and boiler rooms. It can be a little creepy for those who are afraid of ghost stories.The restaurant at the top 'Sir Winston's' is just as nice and gives you and your date a good view of the Long Beach harbor while taking in some good steak and wine.",AlvinCeb
40,Even if you don't go in its worth a look,We didn't have a lot of time due to just travelling through Long beach but we did take the time to just drive up for a look at the Queen Mary in its dock. It is a very impressive ship and worth a look even if you don't take the actual tour. We also spoke to someone that had actually stayed on the ship which is now a hotel and they said it was great value for money and really quaint and nostalgic.,travellerm68
40,Glory Days tour,"We came to Long Beach with the intention of visiting the Queen Mary. We really enjoyed our visit. Our tour guide on the Glory Days tour was FANTASTIC! So knowledgeable and personable. If you’re up for learning about some history, this is a must!",kitkat014
50,Better value than expected,"Took the free 'Passport' shuttle bus provided by Long Beach Transit to the ship, which saved $18 on parking. It stopped right near the hotel and dropped us off near the valet parking. Watched the 4-D movie which was very entertaining with regard to the special effects. Joined the History Tour and also did some self guided exploration of the ship.Initially I had been afraid it would all be faded glory, with the ship having been moored there for so many years. But staff were very enthusiastic and the whole 'lady' looked antic-fresh. A big overall repaint job was about half way done - a big improvement, and I think they were even 'updating' the funnels to give the ship a fresh new look.",Bert V
50,Drinking in History,"My grandmother visited Her homeland via the Queen Mary in 1948, standing where she stood was marvelous. The ambience of the ships speaks a thousand languages of all the should it carried. Very much worth while the tour was informative but enjoyed just walking through the preserve majesty and especially the engine room. After the tour we had drinks in the lovely haunting bow lounge with a spectacular view of Long Beach, then ate at the American Restaurant on ship. I don't think I'l every tasted a better CA burger wit avocado and crispy chips. A lovely full afternoon, I'd do it again",Joye C
50,History lovers,"I really enjoyed my time on the Queen Mary. It holds so much History, I highly recommend going along on the guided tour. They have so many interesting stories about the history of the ship to share. There is a hotel aboard, I personally wouldn't want to sleep on the ship as that sounds a bit creepy TBH. The ship does have that eerie paranormal feel about it.",Kizzle83
50,IN A GREAT AREA OF LB,"Even if you don't want to stay here or take the tour, go down to the Harbor where this sits. Great area, all kinds of places to walk/bike. Go a little before sunset for a great experience. I went to Long Beach State, and this was one of our favorite places to hang out.",drdroad
50,A Right Royal Treat,"We loved our stay on the Queen Mary. Steeped in history, spirits of the drinking and paranormal type on this ship. The room was beautiful and authentic , go for a view over long beach which is stunning. Just watch out for the ghosts that will be around you. The staff were brilliant, and the restaurants were fabulous. Loved every minute of being aboard this fabulous ship.",Sirah2013
50,Lovely Lady still!,"Did my research before heading out and arrived with plan of attack in hand. Had a 25% off coupon so signed up for the Grand Passport tour package ( included all available tours and events). Totally enjoyed the info shared on the Glory Days Historical tour,thanks in LARGE part to our guide ,Capt. James. Did not think the Haunted Encounters tour was worth it,but was included in package. Took all day, going at an easy pace, to complete the many exhibits offers throughout the ship. Huge respect for those involved in saving this historic Lady!!",Sandi20170
10,Total rip off!,"I booked my trip to the Queen Mary a few weeks before my visit. I paid for the Grand Passport option at $45, which gave access to the Diana exhibition, the Ghosts and Legends tour, the Glory Days tour, the Haunted Encounters tour, the Titanic exhibition and the 4D theatre experience.On arrival I was informed that the Ghosts and Legends tour isn’t running for the foreseeable future, so that ticket was dumped. When booking online you are required to choose times for your tours, and the Ghosts and Legends tour I’d booked was my middle tour, so I had a lot of time to kill between the first and last tours. No alternative was offered.I took my first tour, then went to look for the Diana exhibition. As I arrived, I discovered that the normal $10 fee was being waived due to the royal wedding, so I’d wasted $10 paying for it in advance. Do I get a refund? Not likely. It was a pretty shambolic exhibition, with bits of Diana memorabilia jumbled in amongst letters and artefacts from other royals. There were some letters and a few bits of clothing that belonged to Diana, but also a collection of Diana dolls. Riveting. Oh, and no photos allowed for some reason, even though at the far superior exhibition of Diana’s clothing at Kensington Palace you are free to take photographs. Presumably this is to keep the public in the dark about the naffness of the QM exhibit.I decided to visit the Isolation Wards but was unable to access that area of the ship due to it being cordoned off for a wedding party. In fact there were large sections of the ship that were inaccessible for one reason or another.The 4D experience entailed sitting in a theatre watching a 3D film about the ship, and getting sprayed in the face with water. Hard to concentrate on a film when you’re bracing yourself for the next squirt.The best part of the ship was the engine room, which gave a real sense of the scale and power of the Queen Mary in her prime.I didn’t stay for my last timed tour as I’d been hanging around all day, negotiating lifts and the confusing floor plans, and quite frankly I’d had enough. All in all, the day was an expensive disappointment, I wouldn’t recommend it, and I particularly wouldn’t recommend booking online in advance as I was ripped off. I’ve tried contacting the Queen Mary but they’ve not responded, although they have read my message. They want your money, but they don’t care about your opinion.She’s a beautiful and historic ship and she deserves better, and so do the paying public.",Boo S

50,So cool!,"Okay, I am a history nut and have watched Titanic like 30 times and so many documentaries on Titanic and numerous other ship wrecks, so a historic ship in all its glory was a dream come true. So much history on board! I was a bit nervous coming into the Haunted Encounters tour, but I HIGHLY recommend it. I thought I got to see a lot more than the Glory Days tour, but I’d recommend both. We bought the biggest package so got to see all the exhibits. I would have been okay not seeing the Diana exhibit or Their Finest Hours, but they’re worth a visit if you have the time. I loved the small Titanic exhibit, of course. We spent the rest of the day exploring the ship on our own and went to upper decks to see the lifeboats and the WWII gun on deck. Make sure to find the Isolation Unit! The engine room was also super cool and the propeller at the bottom of the ship, but really neat. We finished off the day at the Observation Bar (I insisted on eating on the ship) for appetizers and a drink. Before we left, I used the bathroom that is supposedly haunted and has had numerous sightings, so I was nervous, but I made it out! Only drawback was the first class pool. It is closed for the foreseeable future, guide said maybe 3-5 years.",Ciera J
40,The history is incredible,"I’ve always wanted to stay here. The majority of this place is still original. Our room is big. It must have been a 1st class room at one time.

The Gallerina over reacted by yelling at me and making me delete the photo- a little over kill. Should have eaten there to get parking validated.

Overlook the city like you're docking there after days at sea, have a drink in the bar and have dinner in the restaurant and otherwise experience the elegance experienced by well-heeled thirties voyagers. It is a memorable experience, but because its several owners have experienced problems with maintenance, be sure you see it before it goes the way of Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose.",TraveLee073
50,Hotel with a lot of history.,"Our second stay onboard the RMS Queen Mary. Nice to see they have started to restore parts of the ship. Though teal flooring needs replacement on parts of the ship. Our room was fine, the room had a slope due to the design of the ship, can’t change the fact the ship was built in the 1930s. Good access to parts of the ship, though lots of the ship remain closed off which is a shame.Car parking is $22 a day.There is a Starbucks onboard, good as there are no kettles in the rooms.",Vfrphil
30,Interesting experience but a little run down,"We stayed on the Queen Mary for just a night to get a feeling of the old-time glamour. It was an experience but one night was quite enough. We walked through all exhibits that were free (there are other paid exhibits and tours that we didn’t do) and just generally wandered around. We had fun exploring and the clam chowder at the chowder house restaurant was good if not great. We didn’t like that it was quite cold and windy because much of the ship was open in some ways. The lighting all around the ship was also very dull and harsh... it would’ve been nice if they used a warm light and the old light fixtures. It looks a little like an old hospital with the bad lighting. All in all, it’s a fun experience for the old-time glamour but as a hotel and restaurant the ship has seen better days.",Turtlebackpack

50,Historical Tour of QM,"Fabulous guided tour of this ship-turned-museum. Gorgeous, stately and scandalous. Loved the gossipy stories, tall tales and architectural wonders. An amazing piece of time’s gone by.The Diana Exhibit was remarkable, extensive - overwhelming at times, and leaving summer 2018 - so see it while you can.",ATXHornsMom
50,Worth coming to see if you like a bit of history,"Being British ourselves it was something we felt we should do whilst visiting the Los Angeles area. This ship is proudly part of our Maritime heritage, though quite how she ended up being moored in California I do not know. Something to remember if you are coming to see her. She has been moored here for almost fifty years already, that in itself should tell you to expect her to be old and a little worn. That is much longer than she was even in service. The ship is almost ninety already.We took an uber from our airport hotel down to Long Beach, it took around thirty minutes and cost around thirty two dollars. We were flying back to the UK in the late afternoon so it was a good way of using the time, however if I were to do it again, I would have stayed on the ship the night before, because then I would not have had to pay entry to the ship, it would be included as a resident.It is impressive to see a ship like this, obviously she is no longer working, but she looks like a film prop, definitely from a bygone era. There was no queue to buy tickets, there are lifts available so getting around is easy enough for those with moderate mobility issues. I am unsure if she is actually afloat or just sat in water, you don't feel the ship move at all, but then it is in its own basin separate to the bay. With general admission you can take one additional tour. We opted for the haunted tour which took us mainly around the forward part of the ship, captains cabin, the creepy bow section and the area around the forward interior stairs and the pool, which we were not allowed to go into, but look through the doors. Lots of stories and a glimpse of the most haunted cabin on the ship from the corridor. Someone was actually coming out with cases as we passed by. The tour was around an hour and the guide was very into it so it was fun to do.After the tour you can walk at your leisure around most of the ship. Certain areas are off limits, but a lot is still accessible. Remember though it is also a hotel. There are facilities for weddings, indeed at least one was taking place the day of our trip. There are gift outlets, food and beverage areas and of course lots of information and pictures charting the history of her career. You could definitely imagine film stars on the decks back in the day. For me though my trip was to also face a fear of mine which is to do mostly with the area of a ship below the water line. I can't really bear the thought of the part of the ship you can't see, and it's a phobia I have had for as long as I can remember. So with my previous knowledge that you could actually go and see the only propeller still attached to the ship in situ in water, I faced this and I still found it quite sickening. I know it's not just me, I have read others suffer the same. Basically a giant box has been welded to the side of the ship and this allows you to walk out of the hull and around a tank of water which is eerily illuminated and inside this slightly murky tank is the prop shaft and propeller. Apparently the top of the prop is around eleven feet from the surface, but with refraction it looks much closer. The fact it is quite dark inside the propeller room does nothing to make it any less spooky. If you suffer the same weird phobia, it possibly won't cure you to see it, but it may help in a controlled environment.Uber pick up point outside which was easyily found. It is also right next door to the cruise terminal so makes for a handy stop off before or after a cruise. Go and see it, immerse yourself in the history of an age when travel was very different. Worth the entry in my opinion",TandWtraveller
50,Great experience,Toured the Queen Mary with my wife. Arrived at 10 a.m. and stayed until 4 p.m. After exploring on our own and walking the promenade deck we took an organized tour. Daniel was our tour guide and he did an outstanding job of explaining the history of the ship. After our tour we enjoyed lunch in the on board restaurant. After lunch we did so more exploring on our own including climbing down and around in the massive engine room Before leaving we experiened the Queen Mary story at the 4-D theater. Lots of great history and well worth the price of admission.,James H
10,Beware the parking scam,"The first half hour is free. But after that, you will be charged $18 for the entire day, regardless if you stay 31 minutes. There is no hourly or graduated fee. I had to enter to pick up a passenger from the Catalina ferry. Due to delays, I was not able to exit with my passenger until 40 minutes later. I was charged $18 for 40 minutes' parking. Never again!",tantrarubs

40,Fun afternoon - way to beat the heat,"Spent about 2-hours here with 9- and 12-year olds. Ate at Winston's and it was very good. Took a ghost tour that was well worth it. Ask how to get to the infirmary and engine room, that weren't on the tour. Huge models of many ships (Titanic, Lusitania, etc.) in the display room.",KCRidihalgh
40,The Old Girl,"Staying on a ship without heading out to sea can be fun. And the Queen Mary is a great place to do is. She’s a great ship but remember she’s old. The carpet has a lot of holes and duck tape is used to repair most of them. And the chairs in some of the bars look like they came from a yard sale. All of the restaurants here had very good food. And service here is awesome. If you are taking a cruise, the terminal is right next door.",Janet H
20,Waste of money.,"What a waste of money and time. While I understand the cost to maintain this ship must be exorbitant there was nothing here worth the cost of admission.The restaurant was closed, of which we were not informed when purchasing tickets even though we asked about lunch hours. We found a lounge area that was open, but the service was poor and food was nothing more than frozen pizza cooked in a microwave. Not to mention it was so cold we kept our coats on.The interior is tired and worn. The additional admission fee for a special exhibition was purely a waste of both time and money.I wish I could say something positive, but I think the Queen Mary has seen better days.",Gpage30
50,Truly a jewel,"From beginning to end, we had a lot of fun. The history of the ship was interesting. It was fun knowing about all the famous people that traveled an this ship. The 4D movie was good and I absolutely loved the short films that interviewed people who worked and traveled on the ship. You are free to wander around the ship. I highly recommend the ghost tour. While I enjoy history, this tour adds a bit of fun to the experience.",196LindaC
50,Imagine an ocean liner in the 30's!,"It's like walking back in time to stroll the halls of this ocean liner from the glamorous ocean liner days. We went after 6 pm when it was free to walk in, and there were enough historical photos with captions in the halls to give us an idea of the many eras of this ship. Was glad we stopped in before sunset for the view and the ambience.",EuroCarolyn

10,Waste of time and money,As a museum the ship is really poor.- big parts of the ship are permanently closed- the bridge was closed temporarily- the interior has nothing from the original ship- the guide didn’t do or say anything that brought life to the ship. Talked about irrelevant matters.- the whole museum is superficial and commercialDon’t waste your time going there,JoaAlm
40,A step into the past.,"A lover of both history and the Golden Age of Hollywood, it was a real treat to be able to tour the HMS Queen Mary, berthed in Long Beach California. From a 4D presentation, to the engine room, an original propeller, the delight of shopping in the main Piazza, and a cocktail in the art-deco bar, it was an enjoyable few hours on board. Some of the ship was not available to us but there was certainly enough to see on the ""limited tour."" We had made dinner reservations but still had to pay to actually go on the ship and so we paid the lesser of the two amounts. But if you are a lover of history or of how cruise ships looked back in the Golden Age of Hollywood, this is a tour you should not miss.",AlwaysPlanning-TRIP
40,Worth a couple of hours!,We didn’t plan to stop when we came to Long Beach but we are glad we did. The Princess Diana exhibit is great for the Di fan. The ship itself is great to wander around and experience.,MarkAndCathy
50,Great history on this historic ship,"I applaud the city of Long Beach for ""saving"" the Queen Mary and bringing her to their city. While there are many places that can be self toured at no cost, I highly recommend paying for a tour so you can get the wealth of knowledge from the tour guide. Before our tour started we stopped in a room that was showing some short video clips of people who had diversified or were passengers on the ship. Very interesting information from these clips. We also went down into the engine room and did a self-guided tour there as well.",Cindy E
40,Great tour of the historic ship,"I did not stay on the Queen Mary. My husband & I did a couple of tours on the ship. We did the Glory days tour and the Princess Diana exhibit. While it is free to wander around parts of the ship, I highly recommend going on a guided tour. The tour guide provided us with so much information about the ship. There was also a short movie clip available for you to watch. It was personal accounts of time on the ship told by soldiers, war brides, and previous employees. Very interesting!",Cindy E
50,Nice place to visit when in Long Beach,We actually attended a wedding on the Queen Mary last year. It was great to experience this once great lady of the sea.,Stuart S
50,Fun Getaway Trip!,"Checked in to the hotel around 3pm, then walked around the ship and even went on the haunted tour (only $10 per person). You could easily spend a few hours walking around. There are a variety of interesting, free exhibits around the different levels. The ship has a very interesting past, including service during World War II as the ""Grey Ghost"". We stayed the night in one of the Deluxe Staterooms (two twin beds)- very cool- like stepping back in time. Be sure to ask for an even-numbered room if you want the bay view (otherwise you'll be looking at the parking lot). We visited in March- and there was hardly anyone on the ship! It was like having the whole ship to ourselves! The room still has many of the original furniture, fixtures, and paneling. The only down-side is that the walls must be pretty thin, in that we could hear everything next door. The gift shops and restaurants are also nice. There is even Starbucks coffee available on board. BONUS- There is a free shuttle that can take you to downtown Long Beach area. You can hop on and off at different locations. We went to Seaport Village for appetizers and drinks at the Yard House for Happy Hour.",Kelly_LNap

10,Run down and disappointing,"Had high hopes for our visit but this was the worst ever use of $32pp! The public areas of the ship are in poor repair, we had expected to learn much more about life and standards on board ship and the ticket desk were not informative about closing time of attractions, resulting in us missing the last 4d show of the day.If you love ships and life at sea, don’t go as you will be heartbroken to see how this former grand ship is decaying.",SimonandSerena
40,Loved the Churchill exhibit!,We bought this extra attraction ticket when we bought our tickets to the aquarium. It was well worth it and I recommend that you look into doing the same. We saved so much money! We were too late for the tours so we opted for the Churchill exhibit and it was very interesting. You're able to explore all of the ship and there are a ton of cute shops. We plan on returning to stay at the hotel.,lisa_Utah
40,Be sure to get the shared attraction ticket!,"A really good morning spent on the Ship with the added benefit of the Churchill exhibition, currently available for an additional charge. Its easy to lose your bearings on the lower decks so don't forget to keep the map handy.

The food was great the entertainment was great the way everything was laid out in stages of different events on different levels of the ship I would love to do this again! The history on this was amazing! You can also rent a room on the ship basically like you would a hotel.,Dfergi2105
40,"""a lot to see and do""",Stayed one night and wasn't really sure to expect. Had drinks on observation deck and met great people. Ate at Sir Winstons and we were very pleased. Escargot was average but the duck was excellent. Booked the larger room and the room was even bigger than I thought it would be. The ship is huge and there are so many things to see you could wander for a while just to see them all.,RTinPV
50,Must see!,"I went by myself because although I had my son with me on the trip, he wasn't interested in going. I was attending meetings nearby so I couldn't go until the afternoon.By the time I got there all of the tours were sold out. But I did a self tour and it was fascinating. I even went home and bought books about it and read them. Make sure to try to see everything. I'm one of those people that likes to imagine what history was like. It was so easy to do while wandering around on the ship. The engine room is worth going to, it is a separate entrance so don't miss it. Also the history of the ship during WWII is told in that section and you can also go in this special tunnel to see one of the huge propellers still in the water. I loved it so much I ended up taking my wife on a modern cruise and loved it! This was one of Cary Grant's favorite things in the world. It is said he accepted and declined movie roles based on the schedule of the Queen Mary.",bizfamilyfun
40,Qwerky and fun,"Stayed overnight prior to a cruise and wished we had more time to enjoy the various attractions and tours offered onboard. Not the most modern facilities, but that is the appeal. The whole ship is a living, breathing museum and a testiment to the craftmanship of a bygone era. Quite a talking point when you mention you have stayed on the 'queen'. How often does that happen in modern hotels?",stevesalz
40,Old classic,"This was interesting to look on board. Lots of maintenance being done, lots needed still, old world classic timber and look of this once beautiful ship. We tried to book for a nights accomodation but after trying twice and on hold forever we never got through to anyone so we gave up. We did our own ‘tour’ $20 each as opposed to $45 each for a guided one, we had a good look around by ourselves without the often annoying guide and interaction with other people",simbiotik
30,Free after 6,We went after 6 and it was free. The ship is cool we got lost in the hotel. Since it was free there was not much guidance or people around. We had fun but lots of things weren’t open. It was neat to see for free though.,Javisdad
50,A slice of past luxury,It is amazing to be able to spend the day and night on the Queen Mary. When you walk up to the immense ship you step into another era.You are free to explore on your own or to take tours including the ghost tour. The staterooms have original inlaid wood and faucets that include hot or cold salt water!! The staff are engaging . Many choices of restaurants and a delicious breakfast buffet.My kind of cruise...it never leaves the dock.,sumacv
50,Excellent Rainy Day,Knowing the weather was going to be rain all day we came here. I was pleasantly surprised at how much of the ship you can explore on your own. You get to see even more of it on the paranormal tours. We did both the historical and paranormal activity tours. Our guides were both informative and entertaining. Lunch onboard was very good and reasonable priced. We spent 5 hours here and sure we didn't see it all.,Ken W
50,Always a treat!,"Having visited the Great Lady a number of time, it was a treat to be invited to the 50th Anniversary and opening of the Darkest Hour exhibit. The number one attraction in Long Beach is not to be missed. The guided tours are excellent and given by knowledgeable guides.",char1scott
40,Expensive,"We love historical attractions like this, with all the original decor and fittings on board. The Queen Mary would have been (& still is) a magnificent vessel. Royalty would have travelled in style at the time. There are lots of areas to explore, but quite a few areas blocked off also which was disappointing, considering the price of admission is quite expensive. You also have the option of doing a couple of guided tours, but again they come at extra cost. My husband and I definitely enjoyed our visit and tour; but our son thought it was pretty boring and monotonous; so perhaps not worth the splurge if you bring kids along. There was just one family friendly (& very short) movie on board that was enjoyable, and it was probably the highlight for our son.....pretty expensive highlight though. I think history buffs, nautically minded people, appreciators of architecture & Titanic fans would get a lot out of The Queen Mary.",Mishky1

50,"Time with the ""Queen""","We stayed 4 nights on the Queen Mary and very much enjoyed our stay. The staff was very willing to change 1 of our 2 rooms to another one to better suit our needs. We enjoyed seeing what has been preserved of the furnishings and decor of this once luxury ocean liner. I wish the previous owner/owners had preserved at least 1 of the original state rooms with all of the original furnishings. The Historical ""Glory Days"" guided tour was fantastic and I highly recommend it to all who visit even if only for a day. We enjoyed the 4-D movie and it along with the Churchill exhibit was extremely informative and also a must-see for any level of history buff. Don't miss the Sunday brunch if you are there on Sunday.",Peggy S

30,Under construction,"Part of a getaway weekend took the free Long Beach shuttle from the aquarium of the pacific, had lunch on board at the one restaurant open that day food was good but a little pricey,but made up for with the nice view of the small boat harbor and good service, the bar on board is not to be missed also. Wondered around on our own till our glory days tour( included with the cost of admission) you have to pick a assigned time for this when pu or exchange your ticket. Started on our own from top(upper deck) to bottom (engine room). Paul our tour guide was quite patient and easily heard, and supplied a abundance information current and history past. If your doing the aquarium also do it first. Queen Mary second you can walk around the ship til 10pm. Yhe tours stop at 4pm though I think, but the aquarium closes at 6",xjwhitewing
50,A great evening on the ship,"While in California, we stayed the night in Long Beach. Our view over the Harbour, we saw the Queen Mary. A majestic ship in its day. It is worthwhile walking around the ship. If you have time, have dinner at Sir Winstons. The beef Wellington is super.",Bruce T

40,BROUGHT BACK OLD MEMORIES,I used to watch the Queen Mary sail and be moored in the New York Harbor when I was a child in NY. I always wondered what it was like inside and I finally got to see it. It was like a time capsule. Better to stay there than to visit for a short time. They make enough money from the various tour and things they sell that the $25- admission charge is redundant .,Douglas D
30,quite fun,"We pre-booked our visit which is advisable and spent a leisurely day going round the ship. Despite assurances to the contrary, several of the ""speciality tours"" are repetitive but that did not spoil our day. A free shuttle to close to our hotel was a bonus",peter kaufmann
20,Worn out.,"We had several hours between the time we disembarked our ship and our flight time, so we decided to visit the Queen Mary. We paid the admission ($32 USD pp) and entered the ship, looking for a restaurant to have breakfast. We eventually found the Promenade restaurant. We ordered from the menu rather than eating at the buffet. The food was really disappointing. I had the chicken and waffles. The over cooked spinach overpowered the flavours, and the waffles were soggy. The chicken was undercooked. My partner ordered the eggs benny. The hollandaise tasted like it was from a package, and the potatoes were brown on the outside and raw on the inside. We brought this to the attention of the waiter who shrugged his shoulders and brought us our check - no discounts applied. We proceeded to the tour area where we were informed that the self-paced audio tour wasn’t available due to the renovations (badly needed), however we were not informed of this when we purchased our tickets from the ticket booth. We toured the Princess Diana exhibit, which I would rate as a 5 out of 10, the proceeded to the 4D theatre for the historical show. The 4D aspect is more annoying than entertaining. They spray water in your face, blow air on your neck and sweep your legs with an air hose. At this point we decided that our limited time in SoCal was too valuable to spend any more time at this pathetic exhibit, we retreated to our car to pay $8 US for parking, after having our ticket validated at the crappy restaurant. Without the validation, to would have cost $18 to park. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!",Bev S
50,Factually Intriguing,"Went here to have a look around this old girl, fascinating in the way that as soon as you step foot on her you feel like you are back in time. They have kept her true to the time she was still sailing the seas. I highly recommend taking the tours of the ship, not sure about the ""haunted"" stuff... I didn't feel jittery at all lol but the old antiquities you come across on her are amazing.If you dine in at one of the restaurants you can have your parking ticket stamped so you won't have to pay for parking also :)",Stacy R
50,Truly wonderful.,"What an amazing opportunity to see and stay onboard a real piece of history.The ship is genuinely an Art Deco marvel and exudes charm.We stayed in the Eisenhower suite and it was wonderful.The ship could do with new carpeting and decking in some areas, but given her age, it is quite remarkable that she is in such good shape.Dining in Churchills was top notch and F&B generally was strong.We walked out of a tour with the 'Staff Captain' who was ridiculous and disengenous at best, but did the late night ghost tour with a normal guide and it was such an interesting experience - highly recommend, if not for the ghost content, but for the opportunity to see 'behind the scenes'.I cannot recommend it enough, if you love ww2 / naval / Art Deco history, then you will love it - if you want a modern hotel stay and don't care about the former, then you may be dissapointed.",Madelaine G
30,OK,"Had to make a point of staying on the ""old girl"" while in Long Beach. Historic and quite enjoyable, although none of the olde worlde charm and charisma unfortunately exists any more. Far too commercialised and touristy for my tastes. Put in a very pokey cabin with no porthole. Cleaning standards could have been better, room dusty. No hot water one morning. A one or two night stay for the experience, but no more. Food and drink options limited and expensive, however, Sir Winstons restaurant superb. Reviewed seperatly.",Malcolm S
40,Very Enjoyable to Even Just Walk Around Inside,"We had one night before our cruise and wanted to stay at the Queen Mary but there were 5 of us and we needed 2 rooms, one for 3 people. They said they could not accommodate us so we stayed elsewhere. Morning of our cruise we asked about tours but they don't start until 11 so they suggested we just walk about the ship. That was fine with us and we felt we did see a lot. You can almost see the people of many years ago walking by on their way to dinner all dressed up in their finery. The model of the ship that was in a glass case was so surprising...be sure to walk around to the other side where you can actually see right into the ship and they show where the dining rooms were and the different class rooms, etc. Fascinating. I did take some pictures but I think the ones already on here are much better than mine.",Paddy2216
50,Definitely worth a visit to see this beautiful ship,"Before setting off on a cruise we decided we would have a tour of the Queen Mary and see how it was done in the heydays of the Atlantic crossings. We were not disappointed, what a beautiful ship, so pleased it has been declared a national monument. The tour was excellent, our guide was amusing and entertaining but still got the important information across.The engine room is very impressive and the walkways allow you to see a great deal of what gave this ship it's power to cross the Atlantic in record times. The way the propellers are displayed was particularly good.We also did the ghost tour which again was well done and takes you into some different parts of the ship to the general tour. Again the guide was very good. A well worth visit that took up most of the day. Highly recommended.",kayak22
50,Amazing,I bought a package but think I got ripped off as some of the things I was told I would receive were closed for the day and I blame Viator who sold it to me a few weeks back. The ship is huge and I am not sure I was able to see all of it. I went from about 10 and stayed till about 3 pm. I was given the hunted encounter tour by a gentlemen who kept it interesting and scary. The tour was made for families as they have another one which is a bit more adult themed. However some of the stories we were told were scary noatter your age. The 4d theatre showings were quite fun and you should do both the kids one and the history of the queen mary one. I also did the Winston Churchill exhibition which was very interesting and you could see all the things they used in the recent movie that came out about the PM.,sauditraveller

50,"Make sure you take the historical tour, its fascinating and the tour guide is a crack-up!","We stepped right off our Carnival Tour and walked across the parking lot and went onto the Queen Mary--well worth it! We were gone so long that when we went to get our parked car and pay for it, we didn't have to pay for it because they thought we were dropping people off for the next cruise and they waved us through--awesome! Anyway, the historical tour was really good and our tour guide was amazing and very funny! We also did the ghost tour and it was good too! Next time I come I want to stay on the Queen Mary, i didn't know until this time that it is a hotel as well as something wonderful to see! I really enjoyed it! I highly recommend it--especially right after a Carnival Cruise!",MelCS7
40,Love of ships,Last time I was on board the Queen Mary was as a child in the 80’s. If you love ships and the golden age of cruising this is a must. The Queen has gone through some hard times as a museum but the new lease owners are starting to bring her back to life. Many areas are either off limits or part of the hotel but you can still stroll the decks and explore many rooms. Guided tours of her history or haunted tours depart regularly throughout the day or just go solo and transport back in time. There are restaurants and a bar on board so you can stay all day and enjoy the ship and look across to Long Beach.,Islander1971mv
50,"If you like history, stop here","This ship is fascinating! It's a page right out of a history book. This is how travel was done before jets - luxury travel and also transport during WWII.With paid admission, there is a self guided tour with headsets. Since the ship was undergoing restorations, the headsets were not provided. The crew said the restorations closed parts of the ship and caused many of the directions narrated in the recorded tour to be obsolete. My partner and I were given a map with points of interest and we wandered the ship by ourselves. That option was fine for us, we loved exploring.There were other tours available for additional fees. We choose the ghost tour. Neither my partner or I are believers, but it was a great tour to see into some creepy parts of the ship. Our guide was very knowledgeable on all topics ship related.Like I mentioned earlier, the ship was undergoing restorations and it wasn't possible to see ALL of the ship. I'd definitely go back again sometime to check it out.",Beth T
50,Must see even if you don't like ships,Not a big fan of old ships BUT this one has so much history and stories to tell. Go to the movies and see them all. Take the Ghost tour. We were spooked. Many stories. The ship really is a living thing and holds many stories of many lives.,butterfly912
40,Beautiful historic landmark,"I took the Glory Days tour of the Queen Mary while we were staying at the hotel. The tour guide was very informative and interesting. This was a walking tour that lasted an hour. The tour was on 2 decks and there were a few stairs.The tour covered the history of the ship, and focuses on the first class areas. These rooms are beautiful and reflect the elegance of the best of trans-Atlantic travel in the 1930s.I also walked around myself, following the ship map approximating the audio tour. (The audio tour is not currently offered due to renovations.) Some areas of the ship that are not part of the hotel have not been maintained well - and look run down. Quite a few renovations are underway in these areas that will hopefully preserve this historic treasure.",Richard4188
50,Best Trip,"I saw this ship in a YouTube video, and I kind of wanted to go there because of the history that goes with it. I think around 2-3 years later, my parents were planning to go to the Long Beach Aquarium, and this ship happens to be near the location, so it was a great trip. I know the Queen Mary has a hotel also, but haven't stayed the night there yet. Maybe I'll consider it in the future.",tangjennifer3
40,Good Food & Drinks in Authentic Ship Setting,"We had dinner in Queen Ann room (delicious) - authentic ship setting with harbor views; and then drinks in the retro bar. In between, you walk through Queen Mary's shops and displays.No admission price for this (tour of entire ship does have admission price).",Spiffy4
40,History on the water,It was wonderful to spend time on the Queen Mary. We had a very nice lunch and then took one of the haunted tours. As you tour you can imagine how she must have looked in her glory days and what it must have been like to be a passenger. The next time we go we want to stay overnight. A definite piece of history,swtraveler15
50,Lots of activities. Great historic activity,Third time we have visited. Buy the passport and do all the tours. They are all fun. James is a great tour guide. Plan to spend 6 hours to do it all.,Christopher C
50,Absolutely a Go-To,"The only problem I have with the QM is the distances to walk. It's a long walk from the parking lot, and a long walk around the ship. So if walking is a problem, keep that in mind. Wheelchair friendly, of course, and service is good w/handicapped. The vistas are lovely and peaceful from the decks; the cabins shown on the tour are appropriately dated and sparkle. The ship's chapel is lovely for a wedding (I went to one there) so keep it in mind if you're planning a wedding. Sir Winstons (high-end dining) is superb.",LongBeachEnjoy
30,Step Back In Time,"First off, this is a relic ship with a ton of history, a living museum. We stayed one night in a Mini-suite ... bedroom with sitting room, two bathrooms. The portholes are operational which is a huge plus since the was no air conditioning other than directional tubes that blew air (hot or cool). All décor is art décor with original fixtures & furnishings. There is so much to explore & experience of past glamor day gone by that this grand ship has to offer & the history of this great ship is amazing. She is currently receiving a much needed restoration. Don't expect a 5star hotel but appreciate the grand stratus that this ship once had & all who sailed on her....a classic!!!!!! Do valet parking definitely!",dreamdestinations
10,As a place to stay its a tourist trap,No amenities rooms are dark and small and the front desk does not move very quickdon't get up to take an early shower they turn off the hot water at nightno where to hangout except the bar or a tour no pool lounge chairs etc,Nick B
40,Hauntingly fun time,"We slept aboard the Queen Mary in one of the state rooms. The room is very quaint with an ""antique"" bathroom. It's really fun to stay in such an authentic ""period"" cabin. Although the beds were small, they were comfortable. The haunted exhibits were really interesting.",Dana S
50,Pre cruise stay,"We spent two nights on the Queen Mary prior to a Carnival Cruise. We were intrigued by the history of the vessel. It was like stepping back in history. It is time-worn, but that is part of the charm. The furniture and fixtures are authentic to the time period. There are tours and activities to enjoy while on board. We particularly enjoyed the “haunted history tour”.",Peggy C
40,Cool History here!,"OK so its a boat...a HUGE boat! From the time you pull up to the parking lot until you walk off the gangway back to your car, you are struck by the enormity of this thing. Very cool tour!",Astros80
30,Looking sad,"I was looking forward to this stay but was disappointed on arrival. Th Queen Mary looks well past it's sell by date.It is certainly not an ideal hotel,threadbare carpets,missing a lot of paint . The bedroom was too hot without any way to turn the heat down,the eating places consisted of only one place as the rest were all closed.The food was quite expensive-approx.$100 for 2 (dinner) breakfast approx. $50 for 2.Food was good.as a museum it was interesting but not so good as a hotel as parties are being shown around all the time.All in all I enjoyed it as a novelty,my wife was not impressed at all.",DBXXX2015
40,Very interesting!,"We took a self guided tour on the Queen Mary and we were amazed at the size and good condition the ship was in. The historical information was extremely interesting. The pictures and furniture, the dishes and glassware.....WOW! A lot of star climbing, but there are elevators for those needing them. The engine tour was especially interesting and we spent most of our time there . We also stopped for lunch in the Promenade Cafe and the food was sooo good, especially the clam chowder soup. The Russian submarine looked like a toy next to the ship. The shops, the people, the food, all met or exceeded expectations! We wished we would have had more time to explore.",Cautiouseyes
20,Extremely Disappointing,"My husband and I are natives of Southern California, we both graduated from CSULB and have always loved the Queen Mary, in fact we were married on the QM. We have always loved the history and had a wonderful experience at our wedding, everyone stayed on the ship, enjoyed the piano bar and in general had a great time. In college we took tours of the ship and loved it. In December 2017 we went to see my mom who still lives in SoCal. We thought it would be enjoyable to take her and my aunt, both in their late 70's, on the tour and have lunch. To begin with the cost of the tickets was very expensive for a tour (a movie was to be included, more on that later), over $100 for the four of us, but we had such a great time in the past and none of us had been there in years so we decided to go ahead. We started with lunch which was good and it was a beautiful day so it was nice to sit and look out at the ocean. On our way to lunch we passed a tour group and the guide was so loud and obnoxious that we all commented that we hoped he would not be our guide (unfortunately he was). Our tour began at 1p and this is where everything deteriorated. The tour guide, although very knowledgable, was more interested in trying to be funny and make it about himself to a point of being obnoxious, so much so that 30 minutes into the tour we couldn't stand listening to him anymore that we left the group. He wasted a lot of time standing around and when he did begin to share some information about the history of the QM his tone and way of storytelling was so distracting that it was hard to listen to him. We were all so incredibly disappointed, we had really looked forward to it and for the money we spent it was definitely a huge let down. Because we left the tour early and didn't have anything else to do, we decided to go watch the movie we had been told about and that, was included in our price, about the QM. After receiving poor directions on how to get to the theater and not having good walkable access, especially for anyone who has trouble walking (both my mom and aunt do) we find out that a Sponge Bob movie was playing and it would be another 2 hours before the historical movie would be played. At this point everyone was so annoyed by our experience that we decided to leave. What was supposed to be a fun filled afternoon left us all very disappointed. Our 20 year wedding anniversary is coming up in 2019 and we had planned to have a reunion with our wedding party and family but are now seriously re-considering it. If the tour was that bad, what is everything else like? I hated to write this because as I stated in the beginning, I have always LOVED the Queen Mary, it holds a special place in my heart which is why this experience was so disappointing but someone needs to pay attention to what is happening on these tours because it is a huge disservice to anyone who does not know the history of the QM or is experiencing it for the first time.",Kelli G
40,On Board or On Land?,Prior to sailing on our Carnival Cruise we chose to stay a night in The Queen Mary Hotel that is located next door to the Carnival Pier. It was an easy transition from the parking lot at the Queen Mary to the Carnival high rise parking next door on sailing day. It was a unique experience to sleep in a stateroom of the early 1900s. I'm sure there were many upgrades to make it safe and comfortable but the porthole window and many fixtures were original. Food on board the Queen Mary was more than acceptable but priced somewhat high for my preference.,jrobertson46
30,"Great Ship, But Don't Take the Tours at Certain Times","We love touring classic/historic venues, so we thought the Queen Mary would have be awesome. For us it was simply OK, because too many of the public viewing areas were closed for private functions. We made the mistake of starting the tour at 4:15 PM on a Saturday. Literally every single public area that would normally be viewable was closed due to being occupied by wedding groups, corporate functions or whatever. We had a good tour guide, and he was apologetic for what we couldn't see, but literally we saw just a bunch of hallways and stairways. Don't bother taking a Queen Mary tour during busy times.On top of that disappointment, parking is outrageous if you are just there for a tour. $18 for about two hours. Not sure if the cost of drinks for food would have made up for the parking validation discount that they offered, but it probably wouldn't.",Fred3nPhx
50,nice tour,It was nice to see how this were in the past. They said they had ghost but I didn't see any. it made you feel like you were on a cruse.,Ann A
20,"Tour is nice, but not a great place to stay","We went and spent a night on the Queen Mary. It was not a great night. The walls are paper thin, and the beds are mediocre at best. On the plus side, the tour was very informative (however pricey) and fun. The restaurants on the Queen Mary are also pricey, but our meals were very good. I just would never spend another night sleeping on that ship.",salupm1
50,Awesome Tours,"We did both “The Glory Days” tour and “The Haunted Tour and thought both were good. The first one was “The Haunted Tour” and it was funny & a bit creepy. During one part the lady in front of me kept saying ”I feel something touching me.” Her partner wasn’t close by and no one was between us & there was a distance. The second tour, “The Glory Days” was awesome for the most part it was our Tour Guide James who made it so. He knew his stuff. His love for this beautiful ship showed and made the tour the best ship tour I’ve ever been on. Thank you The Queen Mary for keeping us entertained on a cold, rainy Monday!",janetthom
30,A bit disappointing,We booked to stay on this retired cruise ship for two nights. The cabins are cute as they’re a throwback to the 1930s. Be warned that quoted prices are for a room without a window we upgraded and were so glad we did as even the larger room was very small and stuffy . Don’t expect luxury either the fittings are very old and decrepit and it comes with a rather high price tag of £200+ per room . All in all I would not recommend staying here .,AverageMum2015
10,Tour of the Queen Mary,Way overpriced for just a tour and to make things worse they charge you an additional $18 just to park for a couple of hours. Save your money and go somewhere else. There is just not much to see here.,John I
50,Faaaaaantastic Experience and history,"I was very excited to be at the Famous Queen Mary, but we didn't have idea what about to expect.Was really a such pleasant experience, out bedroom was quite original, but very comfortable and clean, the view from the ship was incredible, all the crew was very nice and friendly, even explained to my son to use the Morse code. We did the tour and hear and feel all the history behind was amazing. Also interesting that in a certain way, Queen Mary will be survive for a long time.We plan to be back soon!",Beta J
20,Paranormal ship walk,"BUY YOUR TICKETS ON GOLDSTAR because they're $22 instead of $45! This two-hour tour was not even worth the $22, though. It is a lot of walking and a lot of stairs, so if you're elderly or have trouble walking and standing for long periods of time, this may not be the tour for you. Wear comfortable shoes! Now, the negatives: this tour is about walking up and down the ship's hallways (which you can do for free) while a guide tells you 4 or 5 stories about ghosts that were spotted in those locations (ex: ghost in white was seen here, moving on, ghost in white was seen here, moving on). You don't get to go inside any haunted rooms or even see the inside of a hotel room - just stand outside the door of both the Eisenhower suite and Churchill suite. Literally - you look at the door. You move from top floor to bottom floor (7 levels) of the ship. While it is labeled a ""paranormal"" walk, the ""paranormal"" activity comes from the tour guide turning off the lights, telling you to take pictures of mirrors, and going home and checking if any ghosts appeared in your photo. She/he proceeds to do this throughout every ""spot."" Many of the short stories of supposedly seen ghosts don't come with a ""spooky legend"" but just a speculation about who the ghost might have been and how they might have died. As a young adult who is scared of even the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland, this was a boring disappointment. Much of what is shown can be seen for free. You pay for the history of the ship... which can be found online (like who built what and who painted what). Also, much of the history is about older celebrities who once visited the ship and in my early 20s, I did not recognize a single name and therefore was not impressed. Definitely felt like an older, family activity! While the staff here is very kind, this tour is unnecessary and outdated. The ship itself is very old and dilapidated. It seriously needs a remodel which I hear is due next year (save the trip for then...). Overall, walking from top to bottom of the ship without any spooky stories or legends or ghost sightings or even a feeling of slight nervousness was simply beneficial for the exercise.",Bloomwink
40,Queen Mary and the Chill the December and January Event,"My 2 daughters and 3 grand-daughters (ages 8 and 11) drove to Long Beach to go to Chill next to the Queen Mary. Chill is an event for Dec and Jan Chill was $25.00 per person but you could also go on the queen Mary. I thought it was kind pricey . They had lots of sparkling lights Xmas music .They had inter tubes sliding down little hills, bicycle riding on ice. Ice skating, bumper boats on ice, Zip Lining. Lots of places to eat and things to see,",kwendorf
20,Old accommodation,"It sounded like a great idea to have the family stay onboard a cruise ship without the seasickness.The facilities are really old (not just old-fashioned). Beds creak, mattresses are lumpy and hallways are long and narrow.It's far away from everything. The SpongeBob show for kids is good, but the other historical activities are full (unless you are a true history buff o princess Di fan).",Elias Z
20,State room accomodation,Staying overnight in the Queen Mary sounded like a fun thing to do but it wasn’t that great. We opted for the more expensive staterooms with porthole view. Be aware though some of these rooms are under a promenade deck. We woke to the sounds of chairs and tables being dragged around above us.The ship is old so I guess it’s no surprise the rooms are too. In our room Plugs literally fell out of the electrical sockets and the enamel on our bath was half off making having a shower a hazard to your feet.The food on board wasn’t too bad though the fries we had were sea food flavoured.Stay for novelty factor and ask for starboard rooms as these face away from the dock and would be quieter. Staff were nice and friendly.,nmobile
40,Queen Mary,"We chose the $20 self-guided tour of the Queen Mary. We felt that was a little high, but we were there, so we figured we might as well. If I returned, I would probably pay for the guided tour, as it was hard to follow the map and get around on our own. I believe we missed quite a bit, as we got frustrated and decided to leave. The employees were nice and the areas were clean.",LauraandThomas
50,Dark harbor,Visited the Queen Mary for a great Halloween weekend! The mazes were amazing and the staff was great! The bars were easily accessible and the wait was quick! Definitely going again next year!,qvega
30,Dissappointing,"We attended a group dinner on the Queen Mary. Dinner was delicious, after they finally served me. They served everyone else at my table and went on to another table! I had to ask for my plate! We were hoping to be able to walk around and look at the boat but were never given the opportunity.",mcjrg1994
50,Wow!!,Didn’t get to have our champagne Sunday brunch on this trip as friends were poorly. But well worth it if you are thinking of it. We did however drive down to re look at this majestic ship. Free parking for 30 mins.,Sparkie154
50,Amazing tour guides,"Do the tours for sure. You get so much more info rather than walk around the ship lost. The ghost tour is fun, but use your imagination and have fun with it. The Queen Mary is a historical treasure, one not to miss. Checking my visit off my bucket list.",Michellelovesthebeac
50,Mindblown,"Wow. What can I say. A spectacular museum and fantastic historic guided tour. However I wish the group size was a lot smaller (about 10 people, not like 20-25)HIGHLY recommend going!",DocAsh59
30,Majestic Old Ship,"The Queen Mary has a great history. I personally like their haunted tour. I personally do not believe that the ship is haunted. But, you do get a great deal of insight to some accidents that have happened on this ship. I also really liked watching a film in their 4D theatre.",Henry P
40,Busy Place !,As tourist we didn’t do our homework very well - arrive at this attraction just at dark on 12/30 Saturday night - big event going on so Place was crazy - charging $20 to just park -,Bob S
40,......Excellent engineering for its time....,"The tour of the ship is fantastic, in size, grandeur and it’s quit an engineering marvel considering the time it was built.Food for thought is that, there were no computers at the time, but the accuracy and finesse of this machine is a wow experience.It has a rich history, ferrying Royalty, cruises, troops during the war.Most importantly is the method of decommissioning of this legend, it’s a hotel, Museum, shopping Centre, church, restaurant, pub, and an amusement park!Look out for the horn when you visit 😀",Stan Ngure
50,Great tourist attraction in Long Beach,I work there in the late 70s early 80s as a waitress and love to take people and show him the big ship. A piece of history and our wonderful tour site with a few great restaurants. Perkins rather steep so my suggestion is to take local City bus transportation,Linda M
40,A Christmas Staycation,"This is the second time we have stayed at The Queen Mary. We were given room A122 which had 2 portholes to look out of and was across from Chill. We heard nice music while the portholes were open and they had fireworks too. My boyfriend found out that they only had the fireworks on Sundays so I was glad I leaned out to view them as they were a little to the left of our window.Our room was connected to another room with children but they were not loud and with the TV on, didn't hear them enough to complain. The room was beautiful with a very Art Deco look with the wood and green fixtures. I'd be back more often if not for the high daily parking and resort fees but it was a nice two day stay Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and only 37 minutes away.",Krista W
20,Christmas trip,"Last year was our 1st trip at Christmas and we loved it. Not too many people and perfect weather. This year it was way over crowded. Not sure if the owners are brewing up business on purpose but it was overly crowded to say the least. We go to the ship every year for our anniversary in February and we were married on the ship in 2012. We have seen many changes in just those few years. Although it seems more commercialized we enjoy our getaways to Long Beach and the Queen Mary.This time was too much. There was blood on a bathroom towel, the bathroom tile was lifting from what looked like crooked flooring. We seem to have the rudest neighbors the last 3 or 4 stays (we know it's not the ships issue), and although we understand the attractions bring business there is just too much noise now and I mean WAY too much to relax and just enjoy.The parking was an utter fiasco and made no sense what so ever. As many times as we have stayed we have ALWAYS parked in the same area which we were directed to this time. There were about 10 cars parked there and a ""parking police"" kind of guy came whirling around to us, ""you can't park here, it's for Chill. To park here costs 27 dollars, if you stay I have to give you a ticket!"" And yes he said it that way and was rude. Even after explaining we did not know and that we have ALWAYS parked there. We were directed to a place right outside that area with about 20 spaces or the lot way far out. Luckily we found one.Let's just say the only reason I'm giving this trip 2 stars and not less is due to the fireworks on Sunday which were amazing and somewhat of a repreave for the ship. Folks these were literally right above us!Queen Mary has some work to do!",Melissa B
30,Decent attraction,The ship was pretty at night but boring once inside. It’s also a hotel but it smells stuffy so I don’t have a review for the hotel.,ruthie123
50,Majestic Lady,Wonderful representation of a bygone era. She was the fastest most luxurious ship built in her day. Nice to see her still around and maintained or years for future enjoyment.,CaptSunshine

40,beautiful ship but felt like waaay too much nickel and diming....,"I hadnt been to the Queen Mary in many years and-with an out of town visitor in tow-off we went last week. My impression was that she looked run down and clearly due for the renovations going on all over the ship. That being said, you are still charged the full amount of admission (for about 3/4 of the ship being avail to see) AND asked to pay for lots more while you are there. For an admission cost of over 30 dollars a person you would think they could include at least one of the exhibits (the Princess Diana one would have been nice) but nope...you have to dish out more cash to see that...or the Churchill exhibit or the ship gallery etc. There are several ""levels' of passports you can thus buy-and yes, the price keeps going up. We DID have the ""4-D"" movie included though=which was pretty cheesy what with water getting blown into your face and the seat shaking (for ""atmosphere"")The only tour we took-and that i liked btw-was the one about ghosts and legends. We were the only 2 on the tour and you do get to see/experience some rather isolated (and creepy looking) things as you hear the stories that go along with them. Go late when it's dark-it adds to the experience, definitely!Overall it was okay but I felt sorry for the old girl; she was once the height of glamour, speed and elegance on the seas but that has almost totally fallen away (although there are still beautiful rooms aboard to see) -and the ""for profit"" aspect has taken over..",5115
40,An Interesting Place to See,What an amazing boat this is with all the history it has. It looks huge as you begin to walk towards it. Once on it we purchased the audio tour which takes you around the boat telling you interesting facts along the way. I find stuff like this interesting so for me it was a great tour. It took over an hour to walk round and we also sat and had lunch in one of the restaurants on board. Really enjoyed this and I would recommend to others. If you do visit this make sure to go and view the propeller in the glass encased area. It's under the water still but looks astonishing.,leetaylor22041983
50,Many tours available,"There is plenty of parking available, but you must pay (I paid $18). Part of the ship is a hotel, parts are restaurants, and parts are set up for tours. I went for the historical tour. There are several other guided tours and, apparently, a self-guided tour. There is an all-day package if you are interested in spending the day taking the various different tours.",ransom007
40,The Queen,Spent a day exploring the Queen Mary. They offer several different options for tours we choose the full experience which includes 2 guided tours along with access to Diana’s exhibit and the titanic exhibit along with a 4d movieThe guided tours took an hour each and were very informativeThe ship has seen better days and they are all in the process of refurbishing with certain areas closed offThere is a lot of history here and I would recommend anyone with a day to spend to enjoy,Keith S
40,Very nice attraction,Stopped by for an overnight visit. The accommodations were great. There are many things to do on the ship from Ghost Tours to bars and restaurants to exhibits. There is s free shuttle from there to downtown. It is a bit pricey.,workingfortheweekend
40,Free after 6pm,Visit in the evening for drinks and exploring on your own. Just off the free passport bus so it's a cheap date! $7 draft beer seems fair to me,lobsterbacks
50,Dinner on the queen of the seas,Had an excellent meal in the Churchill restaurant. The service was excellent. A very good Bloody Mary. And a fabulous steak. Really enjoyed the whole experience. Not cheap but worth every penny.,Jon D
10,Tour the USS Iowa instead,"“Tour” is a misleading word to describe what we got! Most of the ship is apparently the hotel and is totally off limits to tours. The ship is undergoing some restoration so there was very little to see, basically the engine room and a few hallways. The audio tour wasn’t available but we still had to pay full price. We took the haunted tour of the ship as the one we wanted didn’t start for 21/2 hours. The guide was interesting and answered all questions, but he could have given the tour in the parking lot for all that we saw. We toured the USS Iowa earlier in the year and it was great! Go there instead.",dragginfly2
40,What an amazing opportunity to experience history,We had the opportunity to spend a couple of nights on The Queen Mary. Most of the ship has kept its charm as it has been renovated here and there but so much of the original interior has been kept in tact. Quirky but fully equipped staterooms offer a look into the past. Throughout the ship is tidbits of its history. We visited the engine room to see what made this ship the fastest of its time. They offered free guided tours on the ship. They had several places to dine. It is located right next door to the Carnival Cruise line's port so could be a great stay for either before or after a cruise. The city of Long Beach offers free bus shuttles to the local areas/restaurants.,allisond660
30,Catch a Good Guide,I think I got an awkward mix of a group of two and a guide who had an off tour. Seems like there’s great potential for learning but I missed out.,William B
40,Still the Queen Mary,"Been here various times over the past 45 years.The updates and rehab definately look good, but the back half is greatly lacking.They are in the process of building outdoor stage areas which kinda messes things up a bit",BBlkburn

50,Can spend as long as you want,"The ship itself is very interesting. You can do self-guided or pay extra for a guided tour. Either way, you can spend as much time as you like looking around. Great views of the City of Long Beach, marina, cruise ship port and ships coming into the port.",5tries
30,Cool to tour on own and no cost. Also free shuttle drops you off right by entrance,"Went to see the Queen Mary later in the day so there was no admission cost. Unfortunately, many area were close or blocked off. It still offered charm and a glimpse at the past. Glad I added this.",Rita G
20,Disappointed in prices,"When we dot there the parking was $18. I knew it was about $20pp to walk around so i stopped to ask a couple if it was worth it and they said no. We did not have to pay for parking as we exited within 5 mins. They give you up to a 1/2 hour for free so you can walk around and ask questions about tours, etc before you commit.",DonnaS
50,Date night,Went for my wifes birthday. Had dinner at Winstons. Great food & wine. Excellent service. Saw exhibit about the ship & how it helped during WW2. Then music & dancing to 40s music. Overall a wonderful evening.,Graydon H
20,Chaotic Expensive Disapointing,"We had a Groupon, so the damage was only $24 for two I hoped.But on top of that you have to pay $18 for parking! That is outrageous even for pricey California!There is no red line one could follow. We went back and forth on the ship, the ""map"" didn't help.It is also a ripoff because the standard price to get on board is $27 but they sell all the interesting rooms to private parties, so you can't go and visit them.The interior that you can see is interesting art deco.The 4D movie was OK too.But again: for the money you spend there is no value!",ThomasMBall
50,Historical Tour,Took the one hour historical tour of this grand ship.Learned a lot about the ship.Cody was a great guide.,Todd H
40,A Step back in time,"We were staying in nearby Carson and noted that the Queen Mary was close-by, so whilst not on our planned schedule we decided to visit before leaving LA. You can take a range of guided tours but we only had a couple if hours so elected to take the self-guided tour. The ship is now a floating hotel but there are many areas open to the public so we wandered the decks and took in the history. The vessel is in very original condition and whilst some areas are under repair and others are inaccessible, many of the key areas are worth a visit, including the engine room and a look down at one of the huge propellers. A real step-back in time.",Robert C
20,Disappointed,"My son is obsessed with the Titanic and the Queen Mary and other old big ships, and he watches videos about them nonstop on YouTube. He's never seen one in person, so we decided to surprise him with a visit to the Queen Mary while we were in California. I knew it would be an old ship and have dated decor and facilities, so I didn't expect much....but I was somehow still disappointed. I thought my son would enjoy the Titanic photos exhibit on the QM...but we arrived to find out the exhibit was closed for maintenance. So, we decided to go visit the bridge, which he wanted to see...but it was CLOSED for maintenance. So, we tried to get up on the bow (my son wanted to do the Leo DiCaprio ""king of the world"" thing, of course)....but access to the bow was CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE. It was like, are you kidding?? We paid full price for half of the attractions to be closed - ""sorry for any inconvenience"" signs taped up all over. And there is a ""4D"" theater on board, and you'd think they'd be showing some kind of ship-related show...? Nope - they alternate SpongeBob SquarePants and an episode of Planet Earth.So, honestly, the only thing my son really liked on board was the Queen Mary Lego model in one of the rooms. Which we didn't need to travel to California and pay admission to see. :/We didn't eat on board, but did buy some drinks from the Starbucks....which is barely a Starbucks. They serve Starbucks beverages....but that's as far as the brand goes for the little coffee shop.We were there during the time that they also have their ""haunted"" Halloween stuff - which is a haunted maze INSIDE parts of the ship, as well as a cheap-looking (but probably rather expensive) carnival-type amusement park setup right outside the ship. It was clear that THAT was the draw, and not the ship itself.It's my feeling that the QM could be an AWESOME attraction, with a little TLC. And maybe it is normally, and our timing was just really bad. But we all left disappointed, for sure.",mcqker
20,See the boat but don't eat anything!!!,It was amazing to walk among the past that this amazing ship holds. We were enthralled by the carvings and decor. Unfortunately we thought we would have a fancy dinner on the ship and it was some of the worst food we have ever eaten. I have been really trying to eat healthy and had decided to splurge on one extravagant meal on our visit...I wish I had eaten a hamburger somewhere rather than the swill I paid very good money for on the ship. I do not say this lightly...and I highly recommend you visit the ship. It is beautiful! Just I honestly spoke to a local tour guide about our experience and he said that unfortunately that is what he hears - it's so sad.,Sharon L
10,Disappointing,"Do not waste your time and money visiting the Queen Mary. There is just nothing interesting inside. You will pay $30 per adult and $20 per child to walk on the promenade, see a ship made of LEGO and visit the engine room. Nothing special.

50,Better than the Titanic: it did not sink,"A great hotel, tourist stop, and restaurants. You can even get married on this ship. Owned by the city of Long Beach. The first class cabins make you feel first class. Not cheap but worth every $.",johnsH7730QE
30,"Tour only: Greeters friendly, tourdesk and 4Dmovie employees couldn't be bothered, Daniël tour guide the best !","If this wasn't for the tourguide Daniël, with his magnificent voice and exceptionally good explenation of things to see, this was a major bummer. The three girls at the tour desk where chatting with each other when we entered. We stood at 1 yard from them, No hello, no I'll be right with you...nothing. After a minute of being ignored I said quite loudly ""Hello"" well, that annoyed one enough to snap a comment at me....okay we got the directions for the tour start and there the crowd grew and grew. we had our doubts but decided to wait and see and that was a lucky guess this time. Daniël the tourguide is wonderfull, attentative and made the trip worth the money of the tourticket. The 4D movie was okay. The parking price was ridiculous !! $ 18,00 for 2 - 3 hours. Outrages !",Dutchkathy

40,Bought the First Class Passport,"Paid $34 at the door for the First Class Passport. Less fees and more options at the door than buying ahead online. You can choose from several options for this passport. We chose the Glory Days tour, instead of the haunted tour and chose the Princess Diana exhibit instead of the Titanic exhibit since we had seen the Titanic exhibit before. On the Glory Days tour they stopped at 4 or 5 locations and gave history about the boat. It took about an hour. The passport we chose also came with a 4D movie, you can choose between Planet Earth and the Sponge Bob movie, we chose Planet Earth. It is a very short movie but is 4D. There is a short movie before the movie in the lobby near the theater about movies filmed on the Queen Mary. It is a little cramped as you need to stand in front of one of the small screens without blocking someone else from their screens as there are screens on both sides but they are down low instead of up high. It is a large, beautiful boat, undergoing some construction because of age. Really enjoyed the Princess Diana exhibit, had a lot more to it than was expecting. There are also several smaller galleries of model ships to view included with the passports. They recommend at least 3-4 hours for this passport. We spent about 4-5 hours on the boat. There is a lot to see.",Rebecca H
40,Dark Harbor Fright Night,"The Dark Harbor mazes have an eeriness that is unique all in its self because the Queen Mary is old and already gives off that vibe and smell. The mazes were pretty cool but the make up the staff wears is really very good and some are so into their characters that don't out of them. I was by myself on the mazes and psyched myself out. The part that scares is when you can't see whats coming or should I say what. There is always another corner to turn, a passage to go down and lots of the unknown. You can spend as much time as you need at the outside venue. Watching acts or just getting smashed with all of the cocktails that can be purchased. All of the extra eats and drinks get pricey very quickly. Cocktails are $10 to $13 each Milkshake was $9 and a chicken burrito was $10. A can of soda costs $5 and a bottled water was $3. There is lot's of fun to be had as long as you know it will cost you.",Tasazi H
30,It was okay,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn’t really find the Queen Mary worth the visit. The ship has some old time glamour, but generally has the feel of a commercialised amusement park now. The tour was interesting, but we never saw any of the guest rooms which we were hoping for. There was a lot of renovations going on too which is probably needed as some parts of the ship were in poor shape. Considering the price paid for entrance and parking, I was expecting this piece of history to have a more quaint feel without a garish looking Starbucks inside.",Andrew J
40,Queen Mary 2 night stay,"Loved this wonderful ship & I really enjoyed the original fixtures in our room. There were 4 different knobs to turn on the water to fill up the tub; 1 hot salt water, 1 cold salt water, 1 cold fresh water & 1 hot fresh water! They didn't have running water, but how neat to see the way it used to be. Our bed was comfortable & we had 2 chairs & a table.Our room was large & had 2 port holes that actually opened! Our wonderful view was of Long Beach across the bay. Don't forget to ask about the Red Bus. It is free and will take you from the Queen Mary to Long Beach and back.",thorselltours
30,The old Queen Mary,"Booked via See tickets and got a good deal but the paperwork wasn’t clear, we arrived at 9-30am and not much was open . We had a look round the Titanic display which was OK but would have been disappointed if we paid the $15 asking price . We went to the 4D theatre thinking it would be a film about the Queen Mary but it was a documentary about whales and the 3D glasses got splashed every time a whale swam by .Visited the engine rooms .The best part of the day was the guided tour , very informative and entertaining. Bit disappointed that a lot of the ship is off limits .",Geoff B

40,Ghost Tour Fun on the Grand Ole Lady,"We took the Ghost Tour and had an enjoyable time. The guide, dressed in period costume, was engaging and knowledgeable of the ships history, quirks and ghost tales.The ship itself is definitely aging but one can only imagine how grand she was in her heyday. The entire experience was worth the admission but if you are claustrophobic, I would not suggest touring the engine room as it is a busy place with piping, etc. on both sides of the walkway, as it was originally. However, the payoff in doing so is a peek at the last remaining prop.",Dennis M
10,Don't bother,"We had a stay on this on our tour with Great Rail Journeys, we were one of the lucky ones in our group as we were given our room as soon as we boarded at 12:30 but the majority of the group did not get their rooms until after 16:30 after a lot of going back and forward to the reception to complain, especially after other people coming on board were given rooms. Luckily our friends could leave their overnight bags in our room, so they did not have to carry them around with them. We still did not get our suitcases until everybody in our tour group were given rooms, this meant that we were all stuck on board paying extortionate prices for drinks while we waited.Once in our rooms there was no hot water to shower or bath in, after running it for over ten minutes there was some Luke warm water. I would not recommend this to anyone.",NorthStar718399

10,over priced and unhelpful,"On arrival had to wait 45 minutes to check in. Arrived in room at far end of ship, good size but modern and no better than a basic Travelodge. Paid 40 dollars extra and got one of the original style rooms. Beautiful and comfortable. Sadly adjoining room had a baby that cried constantly so poor nights sleep.The ship is beautiful and full of history. However despite being a guest you still have to pay for the tours and due works on the ship lots of places closed off. Also had to pay 25 dollars service fee for WiFi that didn't even work in the room.On arriving home I've discovered they have taken 4 different payments off my credit card. My bill, lunch after checking out - both fine but they have also taken 2 deposits on hold of different amounts. I've emailed them about this and nobody has had the decency to contact me.Such a beautiful ship. So sad that the people who run it have let it down.",nichola l

She was called The Grey Ghost ferrying soldiers over to fight in WWII and bring wounded soldiers and later wives back to America safe and sound. She was never fired on once and Hitler put a bounty on her. All hail the Queen!",Joanne J

40,Dark Harbor Review,"We had the opportunity to go and experience Dark Harbor. It was creepy, scary, and truly haunted. Knowing the Queen Mary is haunted, or at least that is what they say, having the Dark Harbor Halloween attraction is a great fit and was great fun. While the mazes on the ship were cramped and hot, they were spookier and felt more real, if that makes sense. I would definitely check it out, if you haven't ever or at least this year.",TBSoCal71
20,Overpriced & Disorganized,"My boyfriend and I bought tickets for the Queen Mary's Paranormal Shipwalk Tour for $44 each. The tickets indicated they included access to the 4D theater, with the last showing being at 7:00 p.m. There were multiple times listed on the ticket for the tour itself. At the top, the event was stated to start at 10:00 a.m., and at the bottom, it stated the tour started at 9:30 p.m. I called and clarified that the tour started at 9:30 p.m., and the person who took my call suggested we arrive a little early because of other events going on that might limit parking.We decided to have dinner at one of the ship's restaurants before the movie and the tour, so we arrived at 5:30 p.m. and were shocked to be told that parking was $40. The dollar amount for parking was not on the ticket or disclosed to me when I called. Their website indicates it is $8 to self-park with a restaurant validation. However, when we told the attendant that we were eating at the restaurant, we were charged $18 for parking and told that we had 3 hours to put the validation sticker on our car.We ate dinner at the Chelsea Chowder House. A burger and fries cost about $15 and was acceptable, but certainly not the best burger I've ever had.We returned to our car and placed our validation sticker and then made our way back to the boat to locate the theater. We were stopped at the door and told that, in order to go the theater, we had to have tickets to another event - the Dark Harbor. When I showed the security guard our tickets and that they plainly stated the theater was included in the cost, they sent us up to the tour check-in on the 4th floor to inquire further. There, we were told that the last showing for the theater was at 5:30 p.m., not 7:00 p.m. as printed on our tickets.So, then we had 2 1/2 hours to kill before our tour... We walked all over the boat (which is massive), although there is really not much else to do unless you have tickets to other events or are renting a hotel room. We spent a little time at a bar, and it was $4 for a cup of coffee and $3 for a coke.When the time finally came for our tour, we were surprised and disappointed over the size of our group - about 40 people. Luckily, our tour guide had a loud, booming voice, but it was still a lot of people to manage, especially since we were routed through other events going on and placed into small quarters at times.We went through the Titanic exhibit in the dark - literally. Another attendee asked why we were seeing the exhibit in the dark, and the tour guide indicated that he did not know where the lights were. This seems odd, given that the guide has worked on the ship for 11 years. I kept waiting for someone to trip or knock over a display case or something, with so many people in the pitch dark, using their cell phones as flash lights. It was impossible to view any of the exhibit.We then spent considerable time in the engine room, where my boyfriend and I did have experiences, although it is obviously difficult to investigate or ghost hunt with 40 people and several other loud events going on nearby.After that, we were walked up to the isolation room, which we were told security had accidentally locked. As a result, we were unable to participate in that portion of the tour. Again, we were disappointed, since that sounded like one of the most interesting rooms.We were walked past the most haunted room on the ship - B340 - and again, denied access. We couldn't go in the swimming pool area, which is also normally a part of the tour, because of construction. So basically, we paid over $100 to see one of the haunted locations and hear a few ghost stories by a stairway and in a social event room, and that was it. The total duration of the tour was about 1 1/2 hours.Afterwards, we watched the Ghost Adventures episode where the Queen Mary was investigated and discovered how much key information about the ship was left out of the tour. On the tour, we were told there were only 56 recorded deaths on board. We were told nothing about the Queen Mary's collision with a companion ship that killed 338 people.So, if you're going to visit the Queen Mary, I recommend, instead of taking a tour, doing your own research and then just visiting the boat in general. Be prepared to be gouged for parking or find another place to park nearby and walk over. It was suggested to me by a paranormal investigator friend to rent a hotel room there and do your own investigating - in the middle of the night, when the activity from the events has subsided for the evening.",DitzyDot
30,Vast Old Lady of the Sea from a Bygone Era,"Booked a space on the Glory Days Tour as part of my admission ticket. Our tour guide was really good and full of information about the ship and her colourful history. The ballroom remains largely in its original decor and is beautiful. Along with the main entrance on the ship both create a good impression of how the ship looked back in the day. Sadly, the self-guided audio tours were not available the day I visited. Which was a pity because there is more of the ship than was covered on the tour. What's left of the engine rooms is quite dark and can be a bit creepy. There's not actually much to see down below.",Iain M

30,Beautiful ship but bars and restaurants could be better!,"Entry to the Queen Mary is free after 6.00 pm and we had a good sightseeing walk around the 4 or so decks or at least the open parts before drinks and dinner. The ship is undergoing extensive renovation which id being done very well. The ship is very small compared to modern cruise ships and only comprises about 4 decks. Easy to get around and signage is good. had a glass of chardonnay in the art deco bar which was lovely but a bit dark. Service was below par as I had to approach a waiter to come and take our order even though the bar wasn't busy. Prices were high at $14 per glass for very average wine. Proceeded to dine at Sir Winstone's restaurant which again had been recently refurbished but in an excellent manner. Service was attentive although by quite mature waiters! Menu was extensive with several specials like filet mignon and chateaubriand. Starters around $10,mains from $40 and deserts $11 and below. We skipped starters and had beef wellington. Unfortunately this was average and overcooked - disappointing! I had bread pudding and my wife a selection of ice cream to finish. Nice bread whilst waiting with sorbet between courses and chocolate strawberries to finish. This was a classy establishment and a pity that there were only a few couples dining. Well worth splashing out for - our bill was $150 for 2 courses + 2 glasses of wine - pity about our choice of main course!",straightjohnbull

50,A great ship with much history,"This was one of the largest ships, and it is fascinating to see how gigantic she is.

It is very impressive to see.",484karlc
40,More interesting than I thought it was going to be,"Took my teenage daughter. Both of us had just walked off the helicopter at Island Helicopters nearby (see my review of their operation). We were looking to just go for a little walk before departing.At first, with the cost, I almost walked away. It's a little steep in my opinion (but then again, multiple operators of this ship have financially struggled with it over the past several decades, so all the entries are probably not even paying the maintenance fees).Once you're on board, you pretty much have free reign to go wherever you want. Part of the ship is a hotel which I did not stay at but I did check out some of the rooms. I would only stay here if I fully understood what the size of a cabin berth on a 100-year-old vessel is. Once again, each room in the entire operation is a maintenance nightmare so you should only expect an experience not luxury.I did enjoy all of the models of various ships on one of the decks. These are huge, cross-section models some perhaps 15 to 20 feet long. All of them outfitted and labeled meticulously with markers to allow you to understand all of the various levels in the rooms and features. I really enjoyed this part and in fact, had I more time, would've spent at least two hours reading through all of the histories of various ships.I did not have time to go into the for the theater. I think that perhaps is one of the highlights but I did not have time. I did however, enjoy going into the deep parts of the ship and seeing various engine rooms and inner workings of such a vessel. If the entry fee does not bother you, then I think this is a great way to spend 2 to 4 hours.",Ron O
10,Worst Customer Service Ever,"Upon arrival, we were put into a room that the phone nor the tv worked. Hector the maintenance guy was awesome and so polite. He couldn't get the tv fixed. So he recommended we move rooms. It was on level B...so needless to say it was a country mile walk back to the reception desk.Then they proceeded to put us in a smaller room where the air conditioning didn't work so we returned back to the desk where we asked for a manager. We were fet up with moving rooms and we wanted to make sure the next room we got had AC and the tv worked. The girl at the desk, Cody, she was rude and short. Almost to the point, where she made me feel like it was my fault and responsibility to report rooms that aren't up to livable standards.She then proceeded to tell me that the manager was on lunch and couldn't be bothered. I told her I needed another room and that if I had to come back I was going to get a full refund and leave because no one should have to move three times with luggage and four people to different rooms.The last room was fine. We were tired of moving so we made it work. I understand the ship is old but dang, I thought they would renovate it to meet today's standard.When we woke up the next morning we toured the ship. Tons of areas have been blocked off for construction so we didn't get to enjoy it all. Not to mention, when we went to leave a crane was blocking our parking lot. We made it out and learned that we were charged $38.00 to my credit card. 17$ for wifi and $22 for parking. I was irate. Was a major disappointment.",Stacey H
40,Princess Diana exhibit,"The Princess Diana exhibit was good. Seeing the gowns and tiaras she wore, especially on the tv specials the next day gave me goosebumps.

Folks of all ages paraded the decks in period costume and many dealers were selling the real clothing, hats and jewels. Food was excellent and the original decor fabulous. Rooms a little funky but totally in period. Each room had something different in furnishings, etc. One family member even stayed in a haunted room.",ClaudiusIV
20,Cool museum - horrid hotel,"Quite possibly the worse hotel I've ever stayed in. Visit the ship for the one hour museum like experience but be sure to leave. Check in was 20 minutes with two people in front of me - one person working the desk even as a large sold out conference arrived for check in. Predictable is preventable. Rooms are horrid. Dirty. Small. No internal room A/C control. My room is roughly 62 degrees and it's a typical perfect 85 degree LA day. Front desk says no temp controls in the rooms but they can bring extra blankets or engineers can turn temp up or down floor by floor. Shower knob fell off when I tried to turn it on. Chair in room appears filthy dirty, 100 years old ripped and looks like it was found in the dumpster. Curtains don't close. Windows don't close. Bed is same size as my suitcase and made for 1930's sized human. The food and beverage situation is non existent - basically have to cab or free shuttle off campus. No coffee in room or in site other than room service as far as I can tell. My fingers are tired of typing. Don't stay here if you can avoid in any way. So happy I'm only staying one night. Many of my colleagues are here for 4 nights. Ugh.",Nickwarner

50,Historic tour of the ship,"The Queen Mary's was retired from service in 1967 and looks it. It is being renovated, ie, the massive amounts of chipping and pealing paint is being scraped off and painted little by little, but a lot late. From a distance, tbe ship looks regal. From close up, it is sad. That being said, it is a historic ship with great memories. The rooms are large by cruise ship standards, and most of the original lights, fixtures, closets, etc. are original. Meaning older looking which may put some people off. The self directed walking tour takes you from Captain's quarters, to radio room, to uniforms, and much more. Decks are pretty barren with no lounge chairs, no pool. It does have great views of the harbor, coastline, and shipping rigs. Worth a one day visit.",frugalarnie
40,Great Time,"The tour is worth taking and it was really great to see and hear about the Queen Mary in person. Gotta stop off at the bar for a drink or a few.

50,"So Much History, Such a Beautiful Ship, Come Support the Grand Queen Mary!","The Queen Mary is one of the most storied ships in world history. Its story encompasses grandeur (one of the largest ships of her era), luxury and style (a floating museum of Art Déco, a passenger list incorporating royalty, war heroes, movie stars and all sorts of celebrities), and bravery (its service as a troop carrier during World War II is legendary). Now it is dry-docked in downtown Long Beach, serving as a museum and tourist attraction; it also hosts a hotel and several good restaurants (including the wonderful Sir Winston's Restaurant and Lounge). The Queen Mary is still a grand old gal, even though she's famously getting on in years and is getting ready for some heavy-duty refurbishments. Her history alone makes her worth a visit; she's a faded beauty, but still extraordinarily beautiful. Come soon for a stroll on her decks!",Russ_W_and_Kevin_E
50,What a wonderful time!,"My husband originally booked a room over Labor Day week-end. Once we were there, we heard some of the other patrons stating the inside rooms were very warm and very small. (Not sure what they were expecting, but it is a boat!) Anyway we decided to upgrade and get an outside cabin that was quaint; clean and the A/C worked fine-almost too much. Luckily we had the ""portholes"" in our room to open and let some warm air in. The bed was comfy and it was really a neat feeling being there and trying to image what it would have been like to traveled in those days. Definitely something to experience at least once. You definitely need to eat lunch and/or dinner in the restaurants, walk the decks, check out their shops and all the history that is abound on the ship; is just such a great experience. Just remember, this is a ship that has been around since 1936 and they are doing a great job at keeping her restored (and updated with modern day amenities), not a super luxury hotel...but definitely something to experience at least once in your lifetime! We are hoping to attend the Ghost Ship Event in October and maybe even to the New Years Eve party they throw every year.",4demama
50,You can explore a lot of this ship.,"You do not need to have reserved a room on the cruise ship to see a lot of what is on board. The part of the ship set up as a museum tells the story of the Queen Mary ship. But as you walk around this part of the ship, you can view the propeller which has been preserved - children are fascinated by its enormity. There are 2 exhibitions at the moment - Princess Diana and The Titanic. You can pay different ticket values dependent upon whether you wish to view one or both of the exhibitions. We saw the Titanic exhibition, which has some artefacts on display and lots of stories and facts to read. There is only one DVD that plays information about the Queen Mary which is interesting, but there are no seats here. Perhaps a few more DVD clips would be engaging, particularly for children. It was interesting to see how important this ship was during the Second World war and how crucial she was for Victory!",Lieselbee

I did wander around and enjoy the beauty of the ship, on my own. They have a couple of art & history exhibits going most of the time. They are also renovating it, so be patient with parking and some areas being off limits. I enjoyed my stay.",Mmelachat
50,A step back in time,"We had a 2 day stay in Los Angeles and opted for a trip to visit The Queen Mary.Allow enough time for the drive to Long Beach as it took us over an hour and a half from downtown LAThe signs to The Queen Mary are a little flakey in places as the ship is quite close to the main working docks area.Car Parking is very close to the ship and the ticket office is well signed.We opted for one of the timed guided tours but had enough time to wander through other parts of the ship covered by the tour. Check out the engine room if you've time as it gives you a real feel of what it must have been like to work down there back in the day.The guided tour was very friendly and numbers are limited to give everyone a good opportunity to see everything.The ship was undergoing some refurbishment during our trip so some areas were closed off.If you are into ships or history at all then visit this iconic ship, you won't be disappointed",jenx2468
20,Dirty rooms x3,"We came to long beach for our honeymoon and thought it would be wonderful to stay on such a historical landmark....unfortunately, we were wrong. We initially had a reservation for 6 nights and left after the first night to find a new hotel.In our first room, the bathroom floor still had hair on it, and the room was hot and stuffy. We found out that the air conditioning had been broken and the front reception was more than willing to move us to another room. When we arrived in the second room, not only was there hair in the sink, but the throw pillows were stained. We also discovered that the door chain was literally snapped (broken), and there was dinting in the door as if there had been a struggle. They again were more than willing to move us to another room. In our final room, there were long black hairs on the shower wall (I am blonde) and the toilet did not flush solid matter without extra effort (not a romantic experience on a honeymoon). At least we can say that we got a wonderful tour of the Queen Mary as we were lugging our luggage around the ship.When we went to the front desk to check out 5 days early, they did not inquire further about how they could improve the experience for future guest. We were disappointed by our one night stay, but even more disappointed by how little they cared about why a honeymooning couple would check out 5 days early. Clearly, they do not care about the comfort or well-being of their current or future guests.On a positive note, we did have wonderful service from the wait staff at the ""Chelsea Chowder House"". We would recommend walking around the boat and seeing the historical wonder, and maybe grabbing a bite to eat. We would not recommend staying abroad the Queen Mary!",kbennett19
50,Amazing history tour!,"We took the free Downtown Passport shuttle to the Queen Mary from our B&B on East Broadway. We booked the Glory Days Historical Tour and absolutely loved it! Our tour guide was very informative with a great sense of humor. The history and grandeur of this ship is amazing! After the tour, we continued to explore the engine room and check out the propeller. Certainly worth looking at!We took many amazing photos and finished off the day visiting the gift shops (reasonably priced). The Queen Mary was the highlight of our stay in Long Beach!",mitchandmichelle2017
40,History,"The QM is free after 6 pm, so during the summer months it is a great bargain! Parking will be validated if you spend $20 at the bar. Amazing historical ship. Kids and adults will find it interesting.",Gillian D
10,Disappointing,We had high hopes for this visit as our family spoke highly of it. Unfortunately many areas were closed off for maintenance and no employee informed us before we paid almost 30 dollars each to enter.,jrohara
50,memory maker,Very unique and very very fun. We really liked our room even with a bit of a slant. All was so nostalgia.,Kathryn P
30,Mrs,Was not impressed with our Queen Mary stay. We were subjected to Vacation club sellers as we arrived in reception. The walls in the cabins are paper thin and had to listen to the going ones in the neighbors cabins. The air con had one temperature and that was on freezing. Our repeated complaints were ignored. Hopefully the renovations going on will make lots of improvements as the concept has great appeal.,kim l
40,Glad I went,"I agree with the many reviewers who commented that this piece of history should not be missed. We had a nice lunch at Chelsea's Chowder House, then started the tour.I would give the efforts of the staff and the nostalgia of the ship a 5. However, we were very disappointed that we paid regular ticket price and several areas that would have been on the tour were blocked . This was due to the Art Deco Festival and other events.Otherwise, I recommend visiting The Queen Mary. Make sure you are rested and ready for plenty of walking and stairs - you can use the elevator but we enjoyed the interior staircase . Be sure to take time to sit and reminisce . Last , take home a souvenir - many of them are tasteful and reasonably priced.",Cindy C
50,Great experience.,Went here while we were in Anaheim. The Queen Mary shouldn't be missed on a visit to the L.A. area. We toured the ship and took in the 4D movie and the Titanic Exhibit. All excellent. There is a self-guided audio tour of the ship that is offered but unfortunately was not that day because of renovations that were going on. So we went without it. There are tours that are offered as well with a guide (with lots of information). The ship is a sight to see in all of it's majesty. Would highly recommend a visit to the Queen Mary. Make sure that you visit the radio room. Bill and Bill are wonderful!,scubamex
30,Nice but expensive,It was really interesting to see how luxurious this boat would have been almost 100 years ago. At our arrival we were a bit astonished by the entrance fee of 29 dollar. And to see everything the income price was 39. By checking on the website we were even more surprised to see that the income was free after 6 pm. We decided to come back a couple of hours later and we had also a nice self guided visit and had a good impression of the Queen Mary too !,NeleBertem
40,Sail the seas without getting sea sick,The Queen Mary offers a great opportunity to see a grand ocean liner and in all of its glory without setting to sea. The history and grandeur of the ship show how ocean cruising used to be.,buffalojim67
40,Highly recommended.,Great tour. Very knowledgeable tour guide. Do miss the self quided trip of all the model ships. Would highly recommend.,Pat K
50,Fun time exploring the ship,The Queen Mary is a must visit in Long Beach. My family and I had a great time exploring the ship and taking pictures. We took advantage of the free visit after 6 and just took our time exploring.,JimAtKSF
50,Grand old ship,I live so close but haven't been there since a 6th grade field trip. Wanted to see the princess Diana exhibit. Also did two guided tours. Great visit especially if you're interested in The Titanic or history. The bar and the restaurant were also great. Would recommend and I'm definitely going back.,nadine d
50,The Phantom of QM,"This is the twin of QM NY. I was an alone tourist in Long Beach that day. And I stayed on the game. I made the tourist. Snuggled by the personnel, walking through the famous swimming pool (why is it so famous? Discover it!), listening to the saloon history, stroke poses with cast, phantomed by Hostess' tell i let myself go in the history of Jews, wars, Churchill who travelled under nickname, cigars, hats, dresses, shops and 4D underwater movie with water on your body. It's good to become a tourist for one day. Great choice for all!!!",Gian Luca V
30,"Size of ship is amazing, but plan your visit right.","Tips to make the most of your stay:- Plan to be at the Queen Mary for at least half of your day. I would recommend eating on board at one of the restaurants.-Do a guided tour if you can as the self-guided tour without an audio guide is very confusing and doesn't really teach you much about the history of the ship.-Parking costs less if you eat on board the ship and have proof of receipt.The enormity of the Queen Mary is amazing as you approach. Even knowing what you are going to see, the size is hard to grasp. I purchased my ticket through the LA Go Card which gave you access to the ship with a map and one exhibit.Parking on the grounds was confusing even with cones up, but staff in the lots are very friendly. When you get your tickets, you are given a map, but the map was also unclear and I found myself wandering around the ship unsure of where I was supposed to go since most of some of the decks are part of the hotel.I had tickets to see the Diana exhibit which was supposed to open at 11 AM, but didn't open until 11:30. Since I had to leave by 11:45 due to my own scheduling, that really cut my time down. The exhibit has a lot of things that I didn't have time to look at and a handful of Diana's dresses which were really the highlight. I wish I had more time to explore.Parking costs $18 if you stay for more than an hour. I think if you follow my tips at the top, your experience will be good. I wish I had known about those things prior to going. While I enjoyed my visit, I could have enjoyed it more.",Christine
50,Spooky fun,"My friend and I went on a birthday chick trip and decided ghost busting on the Queen Mary was in order. We had a great time! The views toward Long Beach are pretty day and night. We took the 8:00 pm ghost tour, and I got pinched in an area of the boat where the engine are and where a guy (John?) was crushed in a door. I was standing by an escalator. I'll post a picture...of the escalator. I kept quiet about it because I don't like attention. Maybe a bug bit me, I don't know, but I got pinched. It's a good time and even interesting without ghosts. 👻",Luckylibrarian-Gluten Free 2019
50,Back in Time,"This was an amazing place to visit. Walking on all the uninhabited decks and levels was eerie... You could imagine the ghosts of former inhabitants roaming the ship. There are some parts which still house hotel accommadations for current guests...glad to see it is still used in this way .The gift shops on board were so of the time...they even still use the bar...which was so authentic.There was a Princess Diana exhibit, which was so amazing...from her dresses to the personal lives of the Royal Family...being an Anglophile my entire life...this was a real treat for me!",artistgirl1129
50,Romantic date with the hubby,Had an amazing night with my husband we spend the night in on of the rooms and service was amazing everything was so clean it was just perfect for our romantic night 👍,Julie D
50,A wealth of history,"It was a long time ago that my daughter and I visited the QM. We walked through the museum, looked at all the pictures, learned so much about history, all things I was never taught in school in Europe. This is a wonderful way to educate our younger and not so young generation about the QM and it's history. I suggest that everyone goes on a tour guided or self-guided at least once in their life time. Spend enough time (several hours) to make the most out of your stay on that ship and enjoy everything you get to see and learn. Many opportunities are offered: weddings, parties, etc. etc.",dythomson
10,"Poor value, wasted potential.","We visited the RMS Queen Mary as part of a combo package with the USS Iowa. This review in no way relates to the USS Iowa which was wonderful and well worth a visit.Our visit started badly when we were told that our tickets (with bar codes) had to be exchanged for Queen Mary tickets via a long queue. We were then offered our choice of tour at a time about four hours after our arrival. We chose the Glory Days tour because we were actually interested in the ship. We were then ushered onto the ship without a map (they had run out) and left trying to work out what we were supposed to do for four hours.There is currently lots of work going on aboard the ship which made navigation difficult with wooden walls blocking many routes. We also discovered that the bridge was closed, no audio tours were available, the staterooms were off limits due to functions and that the only place to buy food was the hideously expensive Sir Winston Churchill restaurant. We eventually discovered some exhibits in the bowels of the ship.Having exhausted the entertainment options with two hours to go until our tour, we decided to leave feeling very very ripped off. I'm sure our American cousins love the Diana tour, but we came to see a famous ship with an incredible history and received a shoddy experience in what is clearly mainly a hotel. My advice would be to do something more interesting and rewarding instead like visit the USS Iowa.",Darren_Brooks
40,Princess Diana Tour,"The history and information was thrilling, could have spent all day there! Next time I would take a guided tour to get the history of the boat.",Lisa K
50,Loved the history and the tour on the Queen Mary!,The tour staff and iMax staff were very friendly. The tour was fun and Daniel (our tour guide) was great. We had such a great day on the Queen Mary!,Melissa W
10,Queen Mary,"Enjoyed the visit for the most part... There's no doubt that this ship has her place in history and the engine room,QM Voices and certain beautifully preserved Art Deco detail were a must-see...However, some ""renovations"" sit uncomfortably with the original Art Deco and more care could be taken in renovating within the period style.A hugely upsetting experience within the Diana Exhibition.... We were enjoying browsing the exhibition, when out of the blue we were told we had to leave because the security girl had received ""complaints"" about our party. (As you enter the exhibition, all guests are told there is to be no photography of any kind... something we were all mindful of, and at no time did we attempt to take any photos).It turned out that my teenaged son had taken out his mobile phone to check the time... none of us had taken any photos, nor had any intention of doing so (I had not even touched my phone the whole way round) but we were made to feel like criminals and treated very shabbily. We are law-abiding citizens and were very shocked and upset to be addressed as miscreants and asked to leave. I'm afraid I found it very distressing.In fact at first I found the whole thing hard to believe and wondered if it was some kind of ""candid camera"" set-up...!Surely, if you are going to accuse guests of not complying with the rules, you should check that you are correct in your accusations... a thoroughly unpleasant experience, I'm afraid.",Jane W
40,Don't miss this Ship,This will really make you appreciate old craftmanship. It will be free after 6pm but you are on your own. Parking is $18. Worth the free walk around.Food and Lounge is kinda expensive. Might consider the Hotel next time.,Terry m
40,Nautical history,"We used the metro to get to Long Beach and then a shuttle bus, Uber may have been better option and not really walkable from town centre. The ship itself is amazing and you are taken back to the glory days of trans atlantic luxury travel. The place is disorganised, and combined with a lack of signage outside (like prices/option, entry) and inside (like directions to next place to visit), could have been much better. The tour didn't add much to the experience and accessed only one room not able to be seen self guided and too slow. Nice to have a small cafe on board. This is a great piece of history which needs some work to improve the experience (unless you like getting lost). They should also open up more of the ship and a few berths for inspection as well.",Grommet22
40,Great place to spend a couple of hours,My husband and I were in Long Beach and decided to take a trip out to the Queen Mary at 6 PM when admittance was free. It is a great place to spend a couple of hours exploring the ship and reading all the historic facts about it.,AmberHess1
50,Very historical,We took a personal tour after hours which is free we had an amazing time bought a bottle of wine and they have a beautiful bar as well this is a five-star location and they have plenty of hotel rooms as well you must check it out,Peter M
10,Boring and not worth the money to visit,"We spent $150 on tickets for a family of four, plus an additional $20 for parking, and found this not worth the money. The universal consensus was it was boring. There are very few things to see when you are on board and the extra exhibit we tried to tour was a joke. We chose the Titantic exhibit and all it consisted of was a room full of photos and the power was off in 2/3 of the exhibit!! It was difficult to find things on board and even more difficult to find someone to direct you.",Heather H
50,Awesome!,"We walked around the ship on our own for about an hour then took the Glory days tour. James was our tour guide and he was amazing! He was very knowledgeable and articulate. He made the tour interesting for our children by being very dramatic. ""This way my familyyyyyyyyy...""...you will understand after you take James's tour.",Leslie H
30,Entertaining if you're looking for something to do.,We visited the Queen Mary for the evening ghost tour they have. We went to the bar (not the resturaunt) to have a drink before our tour. The staff at the bar and tour check in left much to be desired. The boat could use some renovations. The carpet is worn badly and had a smell to it. They did mention during our tour that they will begin painting the boat soon. The ship has some exhibits onboard and those were very interesting to see. The tour guide was entertaining and fun. We didn't see or hear any ghosts but we did have fun.,C C
30,Good tour but renovations are in progress,We enjoyed touring the Queen Mary. We explored much of the ship before we took the history tour. It definitely is not a wow! attraction. They are starting renovations on the ship. So you may want to wait until these are completed. The special exhibit on Diana and the Royal Family was very good to see.,Donald C
30,Ok,"Interesting to see but not as ""wow"" as I thought it would be. The historic tour was good. The ghost tour was ok. The guide was good but basically there isn't anything paranormal here so they tell a few ""maybe"" stories but nothing scary. It's a nice stop. Don't spend the night.",HeidiBrookeKaelaKirk
40,Go after 6pm!,"I was happy we went after 6pm (based on our hotel recommendation) when it's free. The history is neat to see and, as a cruiser, it's amazing to see how ships still look so much a-like after 100 years. That said, the QM needs a little bit of work. It was confusing to know what you could or couldn't visit (still never found the bridge, despite following signs). The engine room visit is amazing, although there's not much in terms of descriptions. Maybe a guided tour would of helped. Didn't see much hand's-on things for the kids to do. More an adult visit.",Mathieu M
40,"Iconic, needs some TLC","This was one of my must-sees I had planned on a recent road trip. From the outside the ship is impressive. First on my list was seeing the Princess Diana exhibit. To start the exhibit, there was a lot of memorabilia, photographs and history of the royal family. You can spend a lot of time here if you want to look and read everything that is displayed. At the end of the exhibit Diana’s dresses were beautifully displayed. Most of the displays had a picture of her showing when she wore the dress. We choose the historic tour next. It lasts about an hour and tours a few parts of the ship, including the ballroom. The tour was filled with interesting history and facts about the ship. Unfortunately, all the hotel rooms were occupied so we didn’t see any staterooms. If you get a chance, take the self-guided tour through the engine rooms – this was very impressive. The tea room was closed so we went to the Starbuck’s on board and enjoyed our coffee/tea on the deck. Parking costs $18.00. The ship definitely needs some TLC (especially painting) but for me it was worth seeing this piece of history and imaging what it was like back in the day.",NancySeaside
40,Queen Mary Hotel,Absolutely love all the history of the ship and all the tours that are available..It's a beautiful old ship ...The rooms are clean and have lots of the original wood in them ..If you don't mind staying in some history with some updates you'll love it !! We like staying on the ship ..But.... my experience in trying to take a shower was not pleasing at all 😐👎🏻 !!If you don't mind a bath it's fine .I think for the price $$$ that we paid the shower should work or they should give you a heads up !!,Shellee B
30,Disappointing from the outside,"Had expected more of the QM. We specifically drove there to do one of the tours, but it all seems very old and not so well maintained. When we noticed the prices of the various tours (starting at US$ 29.95 per person) we figured not to take the chance and spent over US$ 120,-- for the four or us. All based on the appearance from the outside, it all looked a little worn down and old. On the other hand, it's always nice to be able to have seen some history, even if it's only from the outside.It looked like the hotel inside attracted quite some guests, although the bell boys on the outside of the hotel gave me the same feeling as the QM itself, not very well maintained. I suppose it could say a lot about the mentality inside, as a hotel manager I would take care that the staff on the outside wear fresh and well washed clothes, to me it did not appear as such.",ThomasEMM
50,A must see!,"I had the pleasure of hearing the Captain speak about this beautifully restored vessel. What a treat. The service was great, from the gift shop to the food. A must see!",HerminaR
40,"""Her"" History is Amazing!!!","We were looking for a family outing somewhere cooler and along the coast. The Queen Mary was suggested and so glad that we drove about an hour to get there away from the 100+ weather inland. There were five of us ages 19-70's and felt this was very interesting, especially since we all enjoy history. And the QUEEN sure has made some amazing history!!! She has played many roles throughout her illustrious career. For many years she was considered the grandest ocean liner ever built and many Hollywood stars made memories aboard ship. With the outbreak of WW 11 the QUEEN was transformed into a troop ship and transported more than 800,000 troops. Some slept on cots up to seven cots high!!! She retired in l967. Be sure to see the fun 3D movie and take a tour. Very interesting and we all learned so much.",48thAnniversary
50,A step back in history,"We spend the weekend aboard the Queen Mary, and it was great stepping back in time, with plenty of opportunities to immerse ourselves in the history and legends of the ship. Particularly nice was the forward Observation lounge, which we found ourselves enjoying several times over the weekend for everything from casual happy hour drinks to evening karaoke. Another stand-out is the nighttime shipwalk ghost tour, a longer experience, and in the dark of night really enhances the spooky stories... this was a lot of fun. Then there is an abundance of historical displays and original furnishings and decor that are wonderful to just stroll around and see in your own time (the audio tour was offline for construction, but there were information placards everywhere). We didn't have time to do everything in two days, so there is plenty to see and do aboard the Queen Mary!",SuzanneDinSF
40,Walking through history,"We took a tour of the immaculately preserved Queen Mary. Our guide, Doug, was knowledgeable and funny. It was incredible to see how the upper class traveled across the Atlantic in the 1930's. Doug took us throughout the ship, though the grand ballroom was certainly the highlight. We were not able to see the staterooms, as the ship is now open as a hotel.On the lower decks, you were able to take a self-guided tour through the engine room and see one of the massive propellers in a special tank made on the side of the ship. The tour also took you through the medical center, the quarantine unit and the open decks.The Queen Mary is a piece of history and an engineering marvel; history buffs and even modern day cruisers will enjoy learning about the history of what is now a favorite form of vacation.",Adam S
40,Great attraction for hotel guests,"If you are staying at the Queen Mary, all the many attractions are will worth it. Just walking around the ship is worth the ticket price. If you are not staying on the ship/hotel, the attractions seem pricey for what you get. I would have been a bit disappointed if I had paid full price for the tours.",Tucson M
30,Interesting,We visited as part of a package with Aquarium tickets. The 4D movie was interesting. There was also the choice of a Titanic or Princess Diana exhibit. There was not a guided tour available so we had to find the available locations on our own.,sharon m
50,Walk through history and then dine,"Great way to get a glimpse of times past when folks major method for crossing the oceans was a luxury liner. Rooms filled with displays and fantastic artifacts from a period now past. Restaurants and bars open, gift shop available, and a good view of the harbor.",Dagnytags
20,Princess Diana Exhibit at the Queen Mary,"I brought my mother to the Princess Diana Exhibit at the Queen Mary. We were both disappointed. There was a large amount of photography and memorabilia on other British royalty, but not much for Diana. Some of the pieces in honor of Diana were almost laughable. Like a dress that somebody made for their doll that was somewhat similar to one Princess Di wore. There was a small collection of her dresses near the end, but I was expecting more. I'm glad I purchased this with a Groupon. I would have felt ripped off paying full price. I was glad to be able to walk around the Queen Mary, a beautiful ship made in the days when quality mattered.",frichards000
50,Dining with the spirits,"I celebrated my birthday recently at Queen Mary’s Sir Winston & did “Dining with the Spirits” which included a 3-course superb dinner and a paranormal tour of the ship. Everything went very well from the planning stage to the final celebration. Karen Sellers & Michelle Mahurin were very helpful in planning the event & offered helpful suggestions (like doing the tour at 5pm instead of 7pm, since some guests had a long drive home). We had a photo shoot before the very informative tour. Our Tour Guide Tony took us to nooks & crannies in the Ship (not open to everyone), and had a very interesting story to tell at each stop. Dinner entree selection included vegetarian as well as steak, salmon & chicken – so there was something for all types of palates. Our servers were very attentive and even took pictures of the group. All-in-all a very memorable and wonderful experience – a great way to celebrate a happy occasion! Thank you Queen Mary!",erivere2017
40,Hands on history...,"This is a great visit especially if you have teenagers with inquisitive minds.. the tours are fun, but wandering the ship checking out what made it 'tick' was the real fun for us...",Kushbaum
40,Queen Mary not a ghost ship.....,"she is just a old girl who deserves love and attention. If you are only going for the ghosts, they may not show up.One time I stayed there, my daughter couldn't get to sleep (jet lag) and so I walked around with her in my arms trying to settle her. It wasnt until about 20mins later that I remembered the ship was ment to be haunted, and so like a coward I ran back to my room. I couldn't believe I'd forgotten. But I never experienced anything supernatural.",Monique S
30,Management has gotten lazy,"I loved the idea of staying aboard such an historic ship. What a great idea to turn it into a hotel.But holy smokes does it need attention. Carpets are worn thread bare, duct tape is used throughout for patching and the bars smell like the day after a New Years party.The rooms are pleasant and the staff attentive, but whoever manages this place needs to find a new gig. Someone needs to come in that gives a care.I'd bet the excuse is there's no money to make repairs. But if you look at the pricing of things throughout the hotel that argument falls flat.I get that it must cost a ton to keep this place up, but if you can't make repairs to the place, no one will spend a dime here and you might as well mothball it.Show some attention, show some passion and commitment and at least care about the place. The ship deserves much more than a dial it in kind of laziness.",Mike P
10,Don't get your hopes up.,"I usually try not to write a really bad review, but our afternoon on the Queen Mary demands this. We were prepared for an audio tour, which was not available. We were told we could do a self tour, but most of the ship was closed. The only restaurant available had Formica topped tables (not what one expects for a mid-range restaurant on the QM). We did have a guided tour later, but the leader was so into his memorized script that he was rude to anyone who asked questions. The desk clerk at the hotel part of the ship was equally as rude and condescending. We were treated like we had third class steerage.This COULD be a beautiful piece of history and culture, but the deferred maintenance (floors, decks, railings, paint, you name it --) has gone too far. That added to the attitude of the few staff we met makes this an easy one to cross off your list of things to do.",shayfree
40,Piece of History,"I attended a conference in Long Beach earlier this year and decided to have stroll on the vessel. Due to the conference admission was free, so I don't know how much they charge.The vessel itself is impressive, esp. the 16 ton anchor and chain or the old pictures and the miniature vessels on display.I would recommend to have a closer look at the Lego replica and maybe you can find the cat?

While waiting for our tour to start we were allowed to check out the ship ourselves. After the tour I realized that the only thing that we did see extra was the ballroom. So, don't waste your money! Tour it by yourself! You will save money and time!",n_scarlatescu
10,Vip is not that VIP,"We went to July 4th event. and got the VIP ticket, which is $50 extra. According to the website this extra $50 is for ""exclusive access to premium firework viewing."" But after we finished our dinner and head to VIP area at 8:45 (the firework start at 9), the guard dont let us in, said it is full. So have to stay at gerenal admission area. This is how they treat the VIP. We wasted extra $50 for doing nothing.All I want to say is, If you dont have that much space for VIP, dont sell that much VIP ticket.",Kwan N
40,Look around.,"The models are my favorite, tour fine, but this was once a ship that sailed and the floors, the walls, even the painting in the observatory room ( lounge) is original. Take your time, and look, imagine.",Ayse_7
40,"well worth visiting, but the quality of the tour guide will affect the experience","Our visit to the Queen Mary was an interesting one and we were glad that we decided to take the tour. The ship offers a variety of tours--haunted (heaven knows why), Princess Diana (seriously? What relevance does she have for a ship whose heyday occurred and ended before she was born?!), historical, and one or two others. We opted for the historical tour, which lasted for about an hour. The tour focused on a little bit of the ship's history and took us into a few areas that were not otherwise available to the general public. But it also completely neglected all coverage of things like what life was like for the crew or passengers' experiences on the ship. The tour did not cover much of the ship's physical space, leaving more questions than it provided answers. The art deco décor of the ship was lovely to see and we did learn about the ship and its history while there. Our tour guide was fun and good at his job; but for the price paid (which was not inconsequential for a one-hour tour), we were left wanting for more.",Hugh K
10,I want my money back,"Worst experience ever, 60 bucks to the trash can,all were closed due to a private event,so I paid 60 for enter the ship,use the elevator and that's all and don't forget the 18 dollars parking,waste of money,really I want my money back.",P1zuzu
30,Great for historical visit BUT.,Booked in for 5 days so we could visit all of LA region. Boat is fantastic and state rooms comfortable. But be aware..walls are thin and most rooms have adjoining doors which means you hear everything next door. You are charged parking at $15 per day hotel rate. Everything on board is expensive even at L.A. standards. Shops open at 9 and shut at 6 if they feel like it. Boat is used for weddings and conferences which is not good as you are not treated as a guest. Please note the sunday brunch is just a $60 PER HEAD BUFFET. Nothing else. It is packed but no queues for food. We were impressed with the boat but not the hotel experience. We drank at the bar on 2 occasions where line american guys sat swearing at each other at the bar. Sorry but now we have visited we would not return,wozzer1969
40,An Icon Comes to Life,"So glad we decided to go on the Queen Mary. First it was ""let's just see where she is"" and then you see here and say, I need to se more! We learned so much about here and the fight for supremecy on the ocean as the fastest luxury boat. For any engineer, someone who likes engines the tour into the engine rooms, seeing the anchor, seeing all the work and knowledge it took to run a steam engine boat with the size and needs to do so and the knowledge the workers had (no push button job with computers running it) was so worth seeing. The stories from the service men who used the Queen Mary during WW11 was very heartfelt. Walking the hallways and seeing the beautiful woodwork was so enjoyable. PLUS we caught the Princess Diana display with her dresses and so much more, that was a bonus!",Barbara C
40,A must-do in Long Beach,This cool tour of an icon boat is well worth your time. They also do special events from time to time.,Tony H
50,Worth Seeing this History,"The Queen Mary ship never seems to disappoint. From attending a wedding or out on a date, you can spend almost an entire day on the ship and explore its wonders.",Nas S
40,School Based Health Conf,"This was an amazing tour of one of our historical pieces in the U. S. Long Beach is lucky to have the Queen Mary. Lunch at Chelsea's Chowder on the ship was delicious. Our paid tour called ""Glory Days"" was well worth the time with a very knowledgeable guide.",Terri B
50,Worth the Effort,"I've visited the Queen Mary often over the past 10 years. The restaurants are excellent. The rooms are quaint, but a fun experience. They have excellent buffets. I would skip the ghost tour, it's pretty hokey. You can still explore the ship without going on the tour (minus the pool, unless they changed that). We always enjoy eating Thanksgiving dinner at Sir Winston's restaurant which, in my opinion, is worth the price.",Nattie J
50,Best thing in Long Beach,"Whether you're a history buff, a fan of ships, old Hollywood, the U.K., the paranormal, or all of the above The Queen Mary is a must-do! It is absolutely gorgeous! We stopped by in the late afternoon and it was free admission (check the website for times and dates). Only down side is we only had about an hour or two to explore the entire ship. We could have spent many more hours there! Entire family enjoyed it",Marchelle TV
40,Worth A Stop Just For The History Of This Great Ship,"We actually stayed on the Queen Mary and although I wrote that hotel stay up separately, I will say I did like staying in the Winston Churchill Suite. I heard a tour go by and they said all the suites were taken so they can't show you the bath knobs as there are 4 of them, 2 for salt water and 2 for fresh water. Of course, I witnessed that myself in my room. Too bad because I think the tours get cheated if all the suites are taken and if the 1st class lounge and smoking rooms have a party in them (which apparently they do most weekends). You can take a self guided tour through the ship so there is no extra fee but I think you may miss a lot since many areas are locked. Even with that, there are a lot of pictures and history signs posted throughout so you can see and read for your tour. We took a private self guided tour so that way I can have someone get us in to the areas I wanted to see unless they were being remodeled as the bridge was (which was a bummer - I wish they would list the place that are not open on the tours). The engine room is fascinating. So I think if you are in the area, it is worth the time to see the Queen Mary if you like history.(To Travel Is To Live)",JohnnyOxnard
10,Don't waste your money,"They used Princess Diana as a drawing card, knowing people would respond. The exhibit however has very little to do with her, and very few items. It is a hodgepodge of stuff from many members of the royal family. Mostly, it is bric-a-brac and tons of Diana dolls. Well, I guess you could go to a toy store if you wanted to see dolls. They have a few of her dresses, and pictures that everyone has seen a million times in various newspapers and magazines. It costs close to $30 to see this, and let's not forget the almost $20 for parking. It is a complete waste of money, as there is nothing to see her folks.",citygirl164
40,Be ready to break out the pocketbook,"What a nice place, nice hotel, nice restaurant, nice exhibits.What great history, Cunard Line, Queen Mary is its finest.The downers$18 parking if you stay over an hour!Pushy staff who aren't friendly, would not let my wife use the bathroom while I was on a phone in the parking lot. The acted like we were trying to getaway with something for free when we came to enjoy experience.Do you Want to go to just the restaurant and spend $150 in meals and drinks? That ain't happening either without some ridiculous policies about paid entry which i paid anyway. Get ready to be hassled over it.They could use some policy changes to be more customer centric. I don't mind spending for an experience but I do mind a dealing with a crusty customer service approach, thus why isn't getting a five star from me.",JimDeBerry
40,Interesting piece of history,"If you are a bit of a history buff you will enjoy visiting the Queen Mary. We rushed through our visit and spent most of our time at the Princess Diana exhibit in March. TO be honest I would be very interested in staying at the on board hotel to get a proper experience. Our short tour was enough to likely lure me back again someday, maybe even to stay the night and take in a ghost tour.",Oilerman
40,A little disappointed,Visited QM many years ago just after she opened as a hotel and was disappointed to see she was needing a lot of TLC. However when taking the tour the guide advised that they were to start a refurbishment programme soon. The QM is still impressive inside and the exhibitions are informative and give you a sense of the period she was built and the work she undertook during WW2.,AMSAS8
50,Beautifully kept piece of history,"This ship has so much to offer. It was part of the ocean liner race, part of WWII, and is now sitting docile in the port at Long Beach. We were able to see the quarters, the bridge, the engine room, and it's also opened to the water so we could see one of the propellers which are MASSIVE. There are plaques up throughout the ship telling history and ghost stories. There is also a room that has models of other ships and a cutaway of the Queen Mary herself.",Jessica R
20,A re-visit to the Grand Old Lady after 30 years,"We last came here 30 years ago when it was lovely and really good value for money. We were utterly disappointed this time. She needs either serious money spending on her to bring her up to scratch and safety - a lot of the decks were rotting, paint peeling, or she needs to go to a watery grave. The last time our entrance ticket allowed us to view the ballrooms and other rooms inside. This time, we only saw a very dingy corridor. The restaurants were totally overpriced, so we didn't eat here. Being a couple of people who love ships, we really wished we hadn't come. Wake up Long Beach, you still could have a very good attraction if only you were prepared to spend some money on this lady to bring her back up to scratch.",Amanda W
30,A Docked White Elephant?,"This is a pretty fun place to run around and see how people enjoyed themselves 70-80 years ago. It's a little ghostly though, since it's really aging. Especially ghostly is the engine room down in the bowels of the ship. Do spend some time there. The more alone you can be the more ghostly it feels. Spend some time learning how the engine system worked to propel the boat. You get a much different, and in some sense 'real', feel for the whole big ship by getting to know the engine room. Also get out on the top outside decks. There too you get a better feel of this one-time magnificent gem.It will be interesting to see what becomes of this attraction, since there is so much expensive repair needed to keep it capable of hosting people safely.",royaljay
40,The Queen Mary,"We where lucky as today was it free after three , so we did the tour by ourselves. It's big, we where there for hours and still didn't see everything. They have a Princess Di expo at the moment showing her clothes, cost $5.00 .We got there on the passport bus which is free and does a loop around the wharf/pier area and down town Long Beach. There was other tours which you got head phones ect not sure price?",Jenny
40,Bet this ship was fantastic in her glory days ...,"My husband and I visited the Queen Mary almost 33 years ago on our honeymoon. We were staying in Redondo Beach this time on a little vacation and decided to visit the Queen Mary again. Beautiful drive along the coast to get here. The ship has deteriorated a bit since we were last here, I guess that is to be expected. We enjoyed our history tour and checking out the ship again. This ship was total luxury in her glory days. Our tour guide made the tour interesting.",Jackie A
50,Can spend hours there! Worth every penny.,"What a fantastic visit! It is expensive but worth every penny. Really plan some time to go on each of the specific tours (ghost, history etc.). You can explore almost every aspect of the ship and it is incredible.",Ramona F
50,One of the top highlights from our vacation! Absolutely amazing!,"While vacationing with my family in California a couple of weeks ago, my father and I were excited to tour the Queen Mary. We share a love of ships and history and knew that we would greatly enjoy our visit. To say that we ""enjoyed"" our time on the Queen Mary would be the understatement of the year! We were short on time and were unable to take an official tour. Feeling a little overwhelmed and not sure where to begin, we ran into John (who works aboard the ship). He generously offered to show us around and explain the ship's rich history. He was so incredibly kind, informative and helpful that my father and I felt like we had won the lottery that day! When the time came for us to leave, neither of us wanted to disembark. We could have easily spent days aboard this magnificent vessel, just soaking up the grandeur and captivating history.My father and I will never forget that magical afternoon, and we'll be forever grateful that John shared his time and incredible wealth of knowledge with us. This is a memory that we will cherish forever. I would HIGHLY recommend everyone spend some time on the Queen Mary. You will not be disappointed!",Tara0702
50,Great visit,"Just done a visit to this amazing ship,it still has a great feeling of an era of luxury travel.tour was very interesting,our guide really made it.had lunch on board,which was very nice,tried the banana split,be aware it's huge.",holidaymaker1955
50,Great food and exhibits.,Worth the ticket price to take tours. Loved the submarine. We ate at one of the smaller restaurants on board the food was great.We spent the night and liked the whole experience.,SkinnyEddy
50,The Queen Mary,Visited the Queen Mary and did both the History tour and the Haunted tour as well. We had great tour guides and learned a ton of stuff as well as absorbed a lot of culture and history. You can purchase packages that include whale watching tours or a package that sends you to the USS Iowa. You can also go into the engine room and a setup of the GI transport days. My Grandpa went to North Africa on this old girl so it was fun for two more generations to see her. I recommend this for any age and almost any ability (lot of walking).,Mike G
40,Very cool look at days gon by,To see how the ship was built and the luxury of the ship wow. The tour that go's down to the engine are is the way to go. The guides know there stuff and its a grate way to spend the day they also do weddings,Dale W
40,Nice piece of history,"The company offers different levels of tours and stays. @34.00 per person plus parking we had expected more. I would call the experience ""tour lite"". So much more was possible.But I am glad we did it.",gary t
40,Surprised!,"I visited the Queen Mary only because I had a Go Card which included admission. I thought it would be a little dull and boring, but was pleasantly surprised that it was the secret hit of the day! The museum exhibits are interesting and well put together, especially the engine room, and give an interesting insight into what travel was like in a different era. The 4D Theater was a lot of fun, the food on board was great, and the haunted walking tour was cheesy fun. I could easily have spent more time here, except I had to get back to my hotel in Los Angeles. Definitely check the Queen Mary out!",VacationerGuy
10,Waste of money,"The ship appears to be on the verge of sinking. Half the ship is no longer open to the public,voice guidance is no longer available. The outside of the hull is rusting away. Don't waste your money.",Genodog
40,Watch your head or wear a helmet,Amazing ship.... we spent 2 nights and loved it. The room service was great and we did a haunted tour....fantastic tour guide...and directed us to a self guided engine room tour after....there are some cabinets right above the bed that you have to be super careful of!!! Or wear a helmet to bed!!But seriously...I would go back tomorrow.....great place,Billy B
50,A blast from the past,This was when some of the greatest ocean liners cruised the seas built hopefully if maintained to last for ever.beautiful wooden craftsmanship inside.,Felixstowe2016
40,Interesting - a significant piece of history.,"We wanted to tour the Queen Mary and arrived fairly early in the morning so the parking lot was virtually empty. Parking was $18 but if you have a meal at one of the restaurants, you get a validation to knock it down to $8.Got our admission, which with the senior's discount was reasonable and walked around. Lots of interesting things to see and do and of course, they have several gift shops. In one area, there are large, cutaway models of various other ocean liners, including the Titanic and Lusitania, which we found fascinating as the models are around 12 feet long!!We signed up for one of the tours and our guide put on a great tour, loaded with interesting facts and figures as well as delivering the info in an entertaining manner.Toured the engine room as well and if you're on the boat, this is a must.Excellent experience and the guide told us the hotel is booked up for every weekend for the following year.Just a great insight into the way people travelled before trans-oceanic flight was routine. Must've been something else.",Boone8
50,Interesting and fun,"We paid for 2 different tours - a ghost tour and a historical tour, both were absolutely brilliant and so interesting. The men who took the tours really made the tours as they really got into their stories. You got to see quite a lot, it was just unfortunate that on the ghost tours the pool was closed for refurbishment.",JHR1976
10,great hotel to see all the history from time gone by good food too,just stayed overnight was a nice experience enjoyed the time spent there. A lot of history about the ship and the journey it made,michelle s
50,Queen Mary Tour,While at Long Beach California my husband; grandson and I took a tour of the Queen Mary oceanliner/hotel....it was most interesting and the history is fascinating...there is a fee to board the vessel but it's not necessary to pay additionally for the tour but I highly recommend taking the tour because the history of the vessel was fascinating..it is a lot of walking and a lot of up and down stairs; it took approximately 60 to 90minutes but well worth it...and then your free to walk around the ship on your own....we then went and had lunch at the Charter Restaurant...food was very tasty; priced reasonably and the service was most pleasant...wear good walking shoes and don't dress too warm...we wound up in the bar to just look around and don't miss it...the room was beautiful and something out of a movie...it's also a hotel,eleanor v
40,Enjoyed touring the boat,"We had a great time walking around the boat,taking the tour, reading about the history, and viewing the lower level artifacts, it was very interesting. We had a drink and snack in the lounge - it is a very different experience that you should check out at least once.",Tara1976
30,Nice if you like boats and history,Huge boat with a lot of history. Good to stroll around and visit some of the restaurants and bars. You can also have guided tours if you want,Christophe L
40,"Engine Room pretty amazing, can't imagine what it was like","You can see the ship from downtown, but it is a hike (40+ minutes) to get there. $30 seems a little pricey for what was open, but I can imagine it is tough to keep this attraction running.Pretty cool experience to see what luxury liners were like in the 30's, 40's and 50's. I would give yourself at least 3-4 hours to get your moneys worth.",Slyke18
40,Getting tired,"Visited the Queen Mary at the start of our road trip and although it was very interesting particularly as it was built in my home town, the old lady is starting to look a tad tired and needs a bit of TLC. But worth a visit to see how the other half travelled in the day.",dannyscotland
50,Visited during our honeymoon. Loved it!,"I've been a fan of the Queen Mary ever since I saw it on Fact or Faked years ago! Me and my husband got married in England and spent our 3 week long honeymoon in the Los Angeles area. The Queen Mary was top of my list!!We had lunch here, did some of the audio tour and then the haunted encounters tour. I loved every second. I'm just so fascinated with the history of this ship, it was an amazing day for me.I'd definitely recommend this to my family and friends and would happily return!",tyrant_virus
10,Wish I could give a zero,"Arrived after traveling from Indiana to be told that we had no reservation. We showed our confirmation and were told ""oh well I can't look at future reservations"". We were arriving that day and it took her awhile to figure that out. After waiting 5 hours for our room which a queen bed was requested they sent my wife, my 7 month old daughter and myself to a room with a full bed. The room had one outlet and the outlets in the lamps did not work. The room was extremely hot and the thermostats did not work. We later found out that you had to call the desk to have them cool off the area you were in and we also found out later that the windows opened after previously being told they did not. When I attempted to get change for a $10 bill to purchase waters for my daughter to have clean water in her bottle I was told that the desk does not provide change and that she had just done a cash drop and could not help me. The next night the girl provided change without hesitation or questions. We were moved to a room with a king bed the next night and we were told by Dustin at the desk that we could stay in that room for our separate reservation also. The morning of our last night and next reservation we were told that we need to check out and that there was no reservation for us even though we had prepaid for the room. Most of the staff at the desk do not care to help people. Throughout our stay we saw people being told they would have to wait for their rooms hours after checkin began despite the morning manager telling us that they were at 50% occupancy the night before. I could continue with how bad the service is here but I think I have made my point, you should choose any other hotel but this one but after paying $2,800 for a conference that was here we decided to just deal with it. I hope our bad experience can doesn't happen to anyone else. The phot attached is of what I can assume is mold all around the top of the shower.",MCCampos765
40,An interesting look back in time,"I only took a day trip to the Queen Mary so, I can't comment on the hotel or restaurants but I enjoyed the experience very much. The ship is currently undergoing a major renovation so, not everything is open but, nevertheless I enjoyed touring the ship and learning the very intriguing history. There is no doubt I will return after renovations are complete and I will likely try the hotel.",pgr68
40,Conference Event,Costly but unique and very interesting group dinner with available tours. Grest for history buffs and just intrresting to see the landmark. Long Beach has a winner of a destination here. Definitely a place to see.,James L
40,The Queen Can Use Your Help!,"This Queen can use your help by visiting and seeing her attractions. Yes, she does need a coat of paint and her wood decking does need maintenance however I wouldn't let that deter you from experiencing her charms and history.At the time I saw her they had the Princess Diana exhibit and her spectacular dresses were on display. Made me appreciate how tall of a person the princess actually was and how she still intrigues us today 20 years after her death.",yuniced
20,Badly deteriorated,"At the present time, The Queen Mary 'Glory Days' tour is a waste of time and money. The entire front end of the ship, including the bridge and the brow, seems to be off-limits to touring. Long overdue upkeep and refurbishing of decking is occurring in some areas of the ship. Other badly deteriorated areas are waiting their turns at being renovated. The 'Glory Days' tour that I took on 3 May 2017 lasted barely an hour and made, at most, 5 stops along the way, 2 of them being in the spacious but empty 1st and 2nd class lounges. I sincerely hope that the entire ship can again be made an interesting and enjoyable adventure but for now, I recommend investing time and money in other attractions.",fudgemaker
40,Worth a visit to see this beautiful historic treasure.,We were cruising with NCL from Miami to Seattle through the Panama Canal on the Pearl. We did the Shore Excursion to Long Beach. The bus dropped us off and we were able for free to ride the Hop ON/Off Bus. We immediately got on to see the Queen Mary. Some of the exhibits and tours weren't available but just paying general admission gives you a feel for this amazing historic boat!Worth a visit.,patriciae648
10,outrageously expensive,"We had planned on having dinner at one of their restaurants but they wanted to charge us $30 per person just to walk on the ship. So we went elsewhere. I had visited the ship a couple of years ago for the same reason and they let us on the ship for no charge, I don't know when they changed their policy.",Keytothekingdom
30,Interesting onboard tour,I discovered the Queen Mary when I was riding the free shuttle. I had a free pass to go on but not much time. I saw as much as I could in 20 minutes and I found it interesting. However if I had not had the free pass it would not have been worth it to me as I've been on a cruise before. I didn't take a tour so I'm sure there was much I missed. I'm glad I went but I wouldn't have paid money to go.,Sara H
30,Interesting but expensive,"Self-guided tour not available, so we paid for a ghost tour. This was worthwhile just as an introduction to the different areas of the ship we wouldn't otherwise have seen. Interesting wander. Most of the cafes were closed when we were there and there was a lot of maintenance activity on the upper decks. For the experience we got I felt it was over-priced. Definitely make the effort to go to the engine room.",Natalie R
50,The Engine Room,"I highly recommend walking through the engine room. I only allowed myself half a day and I couldn't accomplish everything. I personally have a difficult time imagining what it was like to work in there, especially when the ship was still coal burning. The best part of the tour was the ability to go into the propeller box, a specially designed room outside of the ship that is lit in such a way that allows viewing of one drive shaft with the propeller used on the final voyage still attached.",FG32
20,Not a top SoCal attraction in my book!,"RUDE is a polite description of the woman in the ticket booth as we forked over $26 admission that included one tour. It had been difficult to say the least actually getting to the place (umpteen wrong turns despite having a gps) otherwise I would have walked away based on her nasty, condescending attitude. Luckily, our next encounter with the gentleman at the entrance was just the opposite. We had half an hour to kill before our “historic” tour and there wasn’t much to do while we waited. The tour had far too many people for a walking tour and therefore the people in the rear really couldn’t hear much. Our guide had a lot of info to impart, however he was not able to answer a number of questions that were asked and he never repeated the questions so that the entire group could understand what was being asked or answered (this is tour guide 101 stuff). One person in the group asked if there was a way to see what the rooms had been like but our guide took that to mean the current rooms and said no. After the tour ended we happened on signs to the engine room and upon exiting lo and behold there was a great display of the dining and room accommodations that would have existed for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class passengers; exactly what the tour participant had been asking about and what the guide should have directed us to. Overall I would say the ship needs a lot of sprucing up, the guides (at least ours) needs some basic tour guide training, and more info/signage/guide help is needed to direct guests to what is available to see when not on a tour. There is great history associated with this ship and it is a veritable treasure trove of Art Deco artwork, furnishings, and appointments, but overall I felt like it doesn’t shine thru. There is a Russian submarine adjacent to the QM but absolutely no signage to indicate its history, relevance, or accessibility. With $18 for parking added onto the admission fee this is NOT an attraction I would recommend for the price. A sad state of affairs for this once grand lady!",fincaran
20,It pains me to say it was a poor experience.,"It is very apparent they don't have the funds to upkeep the ship. It is interesting to see the ship and walk the decks, but is is such a shame that upkeep is not being done. This place has the potential to be something really special but falls short with the lack of maintenance.You have to strain to imagine the grandeur and the luxury which once existed here. There is supposed to be an audio tour, but when we arrived we were informed that it had not been offered for approximately 6 months. They said it was due to the fact that they had done some renovation and upgrades so the audio tour was no longer up to date. If they have been doing renovation and upgrade work then I would hate to see what things looked like before that. There was no evidence of any kind of restoration work going on anywhere so I assume what they told us was just a story.The 35 minute guided tour we took was pretty useless. We walked back and forth (Fore and Aft) three or four times during the tour but every time we got to the end of the ship the room we were going to see was ""in use"" for some kind of private event. So in 35 minutes the only room we saw the 3rd class lounge (a open room with worn out carpet and no furniture. We spent 85% of our time walking and literally standing outside of locked rooms in the stairwells with the tour guide describing what the room currently looks like and what it looked like years ago. To be fair the tour guide was nice and decent but there is no way this tour was worth paying for. Save your money and walk the ship yourself then go home and watch the history channel to see the rooms that you wouldn't have seen on the tour anyway.Other than the meal at Chelsea's Chowder House the whole experience was very disappointing.If you must visit, then I would recommend doing it asap. With what I saw, I can't imagine this attraction still being here in 10 or 15 years. I have heard rumors that the ship is not structurally sound and they don't have the money to address the issues. After being there that would not surprise me at all. They either don't have or haven't spent the money to even keep up the appearance of the ship.You start to wonder if the ship would have been better off being scrapped in the 60's instead of a long painful demise due to neglect.",Aaron3838
50,WHAT A TREAT AND PRIVILEGE,"What a privilege to be able to go aboard one of the most famous ships in history.There's alots to do and lots to see on board.We stayed in midtown/downtown, and got on the METRO line all the way down to Long Beach , travelling through Compton and other places. It was an hour on the train each way and it only cost $4 return!We are big Art Deco fans and the Queen Mary has one of the largest Art Deco collections in the world.You can tour just about every bit of the ship and I'd recommend spending about 2-3 hours on board. There's a couple of restaurants too (which aren't great) so you can spend even longer if you wish.Long Beach has a huge aquarium, lots of designer outlets, lots of shops and fund things to do, so get to the ship early in the morning and you'll have time after to do the other places.There's a free shuttle bus when you get off the train. Ask at the Tourist Information booth for info on the free shuttle bus which goes to the Queen Mary and the Aquarium and the other locations.If you find any of this info helpful, please give me a like.",cartagia
40,Great Breakfast in Cafe,"We enjoyed a very nice breakfast in a sunny room sitting in chairs that seemed original to the Queen Mary (which is a good thing). Very good service and historic atmosphere -- lots of shiny white subway tile. Oatmeal, pancakes, and eggs benedict were all great choices. Great experience.",sisterbay716
50,Great visit.,$30 each to visit this attraction but it is worth the money. There is a Starbucks on board which is great before the guided tour which is very informative. Buses will take you here across the bay free as it's quite a hike from downtown if you intend to walk and will return you free too.,Steven W
30,Love the history,"My mother and I recently toured the Queen Mary. We paid $10 each to walk around without being part of a tour group.As we didn't know anything about what we should see, we blindly walked around. I will say the ship is gorgeous and well preserved, but I wish they had at least provided us with a map.We did happen upon a room full of large models of the Queen Mary and other ships. Those were amazing. One side was the outside of the ship, and the other side was a cut out like a doll house. That alone was worth the entrance fee.I would recommend going as part of a tour. Don't go freestyle unless you know what you want to see.",Jennifer F
50,Do your own tour!!!,"I recommend taking a tour of the engine room and it's haunted! You can pay for a tour but if you ask for a map the friendly staff will fill you in a bit on history and the cool spots to possibly see some spooky things! My tip if you want to have fun but don't over do it, have a couple of drinks first at the bar, nothing too crazy, and then take the tour. You'll relax more lol",Donna C
40,Dinner and Tour,The conference I was at booked a night on the Queen Mary. We had dinner and went on the tours. One of the Tours was a Ghost Tour. We had a really good time. I would like to go back and stay on the Queen Mary at the hotel.,JRK1970
40,Ok! But definitely needs renovations.,"I admit I didn't stay for the tour. I pretty much walked the ship well before my specified tour time, and was tired of walking. Defintley needs some renovation and sprucing up. I spread somewhere just to go eat at the restaurant to get a feel of the place, but even to do that, you must purchase a ticket. $28 or so plus parking costs. And IMAX theatre was showing sponge bob? Really? I was there hoping to see a video about the ship. Needless to day, I didn't stick around for sponge bob.",maryrosevan
40,Interesting destination in Long Beach,"It's a nice tourist destination for Long Beach--I was there for a conference that spanned a few days. Once you can figure out how to sort out where everything is, it's a cool place, there are haunted history tours. Restaurants are nice but expensive, otherwise there is a Starbucks.",Eva901
40,Fun,What a cool experience to sleep on an old boat with this kind of history.My favorite winery has a tasting room on board as well.I ran around this floating museum all night like a little kid. It's not a business atmosphere or even romantic it's just plain fun! Learned so much about the history and just laid in bed that night imagining all the famous people from history that walked the decks and maybe even slept in my state room. Very very interesting stay.,Orie C
30,Just okay,Went on a tour and had dinner. The tour was okay but mostly held in the engine room so be prepared to climb a lot of stairs. I was hoping to see some of the living quarters but didn't get to. The meal was excellent.,Gate57
50,History Tour,Be sure to take the tour of the Queen Mary with James! There are several tours available with your stay. It is complimentary with an overnight stay. James the tour guide steals the show and is very knowledgeable! He dresses and acts the part! Loved our tour and hated to see it come to an end!,Smileymamaw

40,Long Live the Queen!,"My husband and I grew up in California, but had never been on the QM (I know, crazy – right?). We booked an overnight stay and the tour package with pretty low expectations. After all, she is an 80 year old ship and just how much fun can you have on a permanently docked vessel. Wow… were we surprised. The first thing that hits you as you come onboard is the overwhelming history of ship. From her glory days as a luxury liner to her service in World War II. Everywhere you turn there are photos and plaques explaining the fascinating details. (And that is without a tour!!) Next is the décor. If you like art-deco you will fall in love with QM. So much of the ship still has the original 1930’s art and furnishings (including our room). One of my favorite spots – the Observation Bar. The original art above the bar is mesmerizing and the staff were so friendly and fun. The food was wonderful and the tours were informative and entertaining (we took the haunted tour and I won’t tell you what we saw … that would spoil the fun). Can’t wait for our next visit. P.S. the only reason I gave her a 4 rating is because she is currently undergoing renovations and some areas were closed.",Lisa R
50,Graceful Lady!,"We were given the most wonderful opportunity to tour the Queen Mary docked in Long Beach by one of its Captains who was also its historian. From the moment you drive up to her, you are immediately smitten. We could completely understand when the Captain told us that he came for 3 months and remained for 17 years (so far). The Queen Mary draws you in and keeps you mesmerized. Just some statistics – she carried 2,139 passengers and a crew of 1,101. She was put into service in 1936 and came to Long Beach in 1967 and is considered a true ocean liner, not a cruise ship. She had 12 decks. 36 different kinds of wood from different regions of the British Empire were used in her public rooms and staterooms – six of which woods are extinct today. To give you some perspective – two Titanics could fit inside the Queen Mary. The ship serves as a tourist attraction featuring restaurants, a museum and a hotel. As part of the arrangement when she was sold to the City of Long Beach, much of the machinery, including one of the two engine rooms, three of the four propellers, and all of the boilers, were removed so that she could never be used again as an ocean liner.",Maggi713
40,This is majestic! Apr 2010,Another great majestic ship that I truly loved at first sight! The harbour is SO BIG at Long Beach and many ships and boats are there. This is certainly an amazing place to be to see the beautiful sunset view as well as the boats that were parked there.,Laxiaozi08200912
50,The Queen is still the Queen!,"I spent a night on the QM in 2015, and decided to do it again in 2016. 2016 was the 80th anniversary of the maiden voyage, and it turns out that the QM has spent more years docked in Long Beach than she spent sailing the North Atlantic.Spending a night on the QM is stepping back in history. You're not on some mega cruise ship, but you are in a past era. It's really a unique experience.Every cabin is different. Both times I have picked a harbor view deluxe cabin, and have been pleased with them. The rooms are comfortable, but equipped with the mandatory flat screen television and of course wireless internet.The hotel is clean, and the staff is very helpful.Sadly parts of the ship such as the lifeboats are beginning to deteriorate, and I understand plans for an overhaul are underway.Highly recommend!",davidfhale
20,Disappointed,"This is a difficult review to write for me. We decided to stay on the Queen Mary for one night after we flew into LA, before we traveled on to San Diego. We had pre-paid our reservation nod on arrival I was shocked that the overnight price for self-parking was 22.00. We checked in and the desk staff were kind and helpful. I had booked an hour massage and half-hour facial, which I was looking forward to after a long journey. While we waited and rested, we ordered some room service lunch. The shrimp chopped salad was delicious and plentiful and my husbands chicken ciabatta sandwich was fantastic. Here in starts my issues and why I was not pleased. First, the rooms are tired. On one hand it's fabulous staying in a room you know has been around for 80 years, yet you see the lack of care and maintenance. It's sad. Rust on the porthole windows, wood drying and cracking, aging without care. A bathroom with tiles falling off and those repaired patched together like a school child put them back on. It's sad.My husband toured the ship while I went to my spa appointment. He loved looking around but notice the same lack of care being taken in such a grand old lady as the Queen Mary.My spa appointment was not what I anticipated it to be nor worth the money paid. The massage therapist was odd. I felt very uncomfortable and the techniques used were strange, not what I have had in the past for a traditional massage. It took him forever and as some might appreciate that he went over the sixty minutes, he had not finished the massage. He spent way too much time on areas where they were just fine and not on the places that needed work. Because he ran over, my facial ran incredibly short and was nothing like it should have been. Our dinner reservation had to be changed but even with that adjustment, I did not receive the full facial. This is all made worse by the fact that Was charged a different price than what I had booked AND I was told I had to leave either a fifteen or eighteen percent tip. My bill was atrocious. Twice as much as I expected for such horrible service.Then comes dinner. Chelsea Chowder House is old and run down. It's dark, smelly and although the food is good, it is horribly overpriced and the same menu as room service.The husband says he is glad that we came and had the experience as it is obvious The Queen Mary will not be around much longer. Me, I would have just preferred an airport hotel with a free breakfast. It certainly was not worth the extra four hundred dollars we paid for food and the Spa. Kicking myself on that one. So very sad.",jmgile50
50,The Haunted Encounters Tour was Awesome!,The haunted encounters tours was excellent. Out tour guide Cody was terrific. Loved the historic elements to the tour as well. We took some time to explore the ship before our tour. The kids loved every minute of it.,Campbls
20,Why so expensive?,"Cool attraction but not worth the price per person, especially for children. Parking is also very expensive and it was a pain to get to. It is probably better if you are staying overnight here so you get better value for money.",AlanaN1111
30,She's a Treasure,Had one night. Loved the art deco original features. She must have been a fab ship in her time. When staying don't expect the Ritz. You are taking a trip back In time. Our 1st room given to us was extremely noisey. It was windowless with a dreadful drone. We asked to move which was no problem. Our 2nd room had a port hole and was roomy. Bed very comfy. Loads of room to move. Ask as many questions at reception as possible. There is lots to know. We were given no info about anything from our receptionist -we later heard a great wealth of info been given to other guests by a more helpful staff member.Take the tour. It's interesting.Also free bus to Long Beach just down from the ship.,Moo B
30,A mixed bag,"Parts of the ship are worth seeing as examples of opulence from a time gone by. Parts of the ship are in sad disrepair. The historical was led by a fellow whose style evoked mimicry from preschoolers and which at least two professional educators found crossed the line into weird. He also was much more focused on his presentation than he was on responding to his customers. The 4-D theatre was a rip-off -- a 15 minute film that had nothing to do with the Queen Mary and whose ""special effects"" were silly and a distraction from the content of the film.",Bruce H
30,Average experience,I visited Queen Mary together with my wife. Before the visit we had great expectations but were dissapointed.Of course the ship as it is is worth a visit and has its own interesting history. Walking around meeting several closed areas was waste of time.We joined the Haunted Tour expecting to see spooky places but it turned out to be ghost story telling.The highlight was the engine room which was well kept and interesting.,Steen123456789
30,Uninspiring.,"A relic of the past that looks like it. Interesting for ship buffs, but overall.... well, go see it, and judge for yourself. The Sunday brunch is worth a visit.",Eagleone1776
40,Surprisingly BIG,"Visited the Queen Mary on a recent trip to Long Beach. Impressive sight and bigger than I expected. You can feel the history and is worth the visit. Parking no problem. My only criticism is that from a distance, the liner appears a little neglected an perhaps needing a refresher coat of paint. This is one of the world's great historic ships and deserves to be kept pristine and perhaps better promoted.",GJ W
40,Historic experience,"The queen Mary is looking a little rough. Peeling paint, etc. Good news is there is restoration work in progress. Bad news for those who pay to tour are the audio tour was not working and some of the onboard experiences like the art gallery and princess Diana exhibit were closed. We did the glory days tour and had lunch in the Chelsea. Would plan on spending several hours.",mdgipsy
50,Me and my big sis,"Had a bite in the deck lounge, quite tasty appetizers, took in the haunted tour (booowhaaaaa!!)and just strolled around on deck, looking for Hercule Poirot!! Lovely!!!",BarbaraJHB
20,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this but from my initial call prior to visiting I wasn't that impressed. The agent on phone was not forthcoming with information. It was like pulling teeth. Once I arrived the ticket agent was not very helpful or personable. It took a woman from the entrance into the ship/hotel to explain what was required so back to ticket agent I went. She still wasn't very personable. I purchase my basic ticket and off I go on my self guided tour. There is no audio available. Just read your way through. I'm sure the guided tour (which I ran into) would offer more interesting information but cannot comment on that or the haunted tours. Everything seemed to be blocked off except the engine room and 4th deck (shopping). Overall I found it very disappointing. I did wander into the guest room areas just to see a bit more (but not much). I realize renovations are required on something as old as this ship but honestly, save your money. Best part of the visit was the uber drive. On a side note...I generally only leave positive recommendations but this one needed saying. If there was a family doing this it would be very expensive. I would check beforehand before going.",Karen M
50,Excellent,We had a New Year Branch 2016.It was extraordinary experience .Abandon of different dishes plus live music. Highly recommended.,regina b
30,"Nice Boat, bit of a rip off","We visited the Queen Mary April 1st, 2017. It a nice attraction, but a little pricey for what you get. $18 to park and $30 each to get in, which includes one guided tour. Try to get Justin if you take the history tour. He was amusing and seemed to enjoy his job.The self guided audio stuff didn't work on the day we were there, the Princess Diana exhibit was closed and there were not a lot of guided tours. The 4D movie was either an 8 minute Sponge Bob video and/or 15 minute Planet Earth video. We saw the latter, it was ok, not really a 3D movie so the effects were so so.There wasn't a lot to see, but am still happy that we went. Would rate it as OK. 6 out of 10. Maybe when everything is open it would get a 7.There was an amazing restaurant just before you get to the parking lot, called The Reef. We had short ribs and caesar salad. It was probably the best caesar salad I have had in years.We stayed at the Residence Inn Marriott Long Beach. This was a 20 minute walk from the ship. This hotel was very good and will be reviewed as well.I would recommend all three places mentioned in this review. Just do not expect an incredible excursion, it is slightly above average.",travellingman747
50,Interesting piece of history,"RMS Queen Mary, it is a historical attraction to visit, it has restaurants, a hotel, a museum, exhibitions and a gift shop, this was used from 1936 to 1967.They offer tours and are really nice and fun, sucah as the one that talks about the ghosts on the ship.As a part of history , it is really worth to take a visit here and the food is really good.",L G
40,Definitely worth a stop or a night over.,"Glad we stayed here and enjoyed the historical ambiance. Disappointed we could not get audio head sets to do the self guided tour since they were all broken. We arrived late on a delayed flight from New York so missed the regular and ghost tours so can not comment on that. It is worth a look see because it does take you back to another time. Lots going on...an anniversary party, a wedding and I believe a birthday bash.",Calmfr2
40,The History is very interesting and moving.,"We loved the history of the Queen Mary. It was fully occupied when we visited so we were not able to see the room accommodations. The ship is in stages of renovation and one tour and two exhibits were closed the day we visited. But even with that, it was a very interesting tour with James leading the way. Be sure to see the film of stories told by people who had traveled on the ship for different reasons, such as soldiers returning from WWII when the Queen was painted gray and used as a military transport, a Jewish man whose family was saved from Hitler's regime just before being rounded up for extermination. Also the British war brides who came to America as a large group. Fascinating. Lots of historical testimonies from people who were married on the ship, celebrated certain holidays there every year, had first dates there, etc. You feel the lives of so many who have been on her that it is a moving experience.",Bumblecreek2
40,Great piece of histroy,"Let me start by saying that there is a huge renovation going on right now (April 2017) so some parts of this ship are closed off (otherwise, I'd probably give a 5 star reivew). Regardless, there is still a lot to see on the ship - self exploration is fun as there are little info plaques sprinkled everywhere. It's also supposed to be one of the most haunted spots in America, so there is of course a haunted encounters tour! Even if you're not big on ghost stories, our great tour guide Sandy sprinkled in plenty of historical facts and anecdotes. The tour takes you into portions of the ship you would not normally get to access. Your tour ticket also gets you free access to the 4D theater there which was showing Spongebob or Planet Earth: Shallow Seas.",Angela O
50,"Special place to visit, a must.","I absolutely loved my visit aboard the Queen Mary! It's a tourist must. Very nostalgic and interesting, guided tours available although if you are on your own there is enough information around the ship if you take off on your own. Lots of staff walking around helping and informing you. There was a wedding on board during our visit and it looked stunning. We dined in the restaurant at night and the food was excellent. An all round enjoyable experience.",mandysneddon
40,I Love the QM,"I just love the Queen Mary. She has her ups and downs and I understand there has been some water damage with California's 2017 record rain storms. BUT, if you do nothing else, go aboard and walk the decks. Take a tour. Our QM is sooo full of history. If you're a history buff (at all) you gotta go!",Carol C
20,Not Worth the Money,"We visited here in while in SoCal for Spring Break. What a waste of money. $160 for 5 tickets, 2 of them were kids, 1 was a senior. They only gave the senior a money break, and then charged us ""ticket fees"" which basically ate up the only money break we got.We did the basic history tour, and our tour guide was great. However, I felt like all we were shown were the places you could spend money on the Queen Mary. The shopping area, the bar, the chapel where you can get married, the hotel area. Then we were left to explore on our own but everything was closed up, like the bridge, the pool room, and the audio tour. We saw the engine room and left. What a huge disappointment. I was here in the late 90's, and our tour was wonderful and full of so much more information - not to mention getting to see so much more of the ship. It was also irritating that the audio tour wasn't working, especially when no one informed us of that before we spent the money on the tickets. No information was given ahead of time to let us know of all the places on the ship that were closed for renovation.Which leads me to my last complaint - this ship needs some TLC and quickly. The paint is old, faded and chipping badly on the exterior. Inside feels old and worn down. The chapel for weddings was hideous - straight out of the 80's inside. I know renovating takes a lot of money, but they really need to do it or this ship is going to go to the scrap yard, which would be a tragedy. She's a beautiful old ship with so much history - she just needs some love.HOWEVER - we bought ""combo"" tickets to see both the Queen Mary and the USS Iowa, docked 7 miles away, and the Iowa was AWESOME. See my review of that!!",5280momma
50,Thanksgiving,Went to the Queen Mary for Thanksgiving and was not disappointed. There were many different dining options available. We ate in the grand ballroom table next to a harp player . And that was an ice sculpture that was massive. It was so romantic and the food was delicious. Really enjoyed it try this you won't be disappointed. Reservations highly recommended. A lot of people show up unprepared,Drnasadan
20,Under renovation,We were very disappointed in the Queen Mary. Much of the ship is not accessible due to major renovation in progress. Even the tour seem to be cut short and we were not allowed to go in many of the areas.,pheimer53
10,Waste of time and money,"I booked these tickets well in advance and there was no mention on the website of any restrictions (apart from the Diana experience). However when we got there at 10am we quickly found out that a lot of the points of interest were closed and even the audio tour was not available! We were told that we had to wait until 12.15pm for our tour, which would have been fine if we had the audio guide but without anything to see or do it was going to be a long 2+hrs!!. We complained to the ticket office who couldn't give us a refund. They told us that the audio tour was only a read-out of the plaques on the wall next to the numbers so we could go ahead and do it on our own. So we set off trying to follow the numbers and read the information. Try as we might, we couldn't find numbers 1 or 2 so we set off aimlessly wandering. The observation lounge was shut. The bridge was shut. The dining rooms were closed for a private function. We didn't even get to see a restored cabin or anything. There was just nothing to see apart from the engine room and a 'communications' room (where there was no information to read). We didn't get to see the pool and hardly any of the original features of the ship have been retained (it's lost the cinema) Funnily enough all the shops were not affected by the renovations!!On our wanderings we found plaque 7 for the audio tour (hurray!) but there was no written info. 30 minutes later we left after wandering around aimlessly not feeling like we learnt or saw anything. There would have been a further 1hr45 wait for our tour to start (we were told you could turn up 'anytime' but turns out they only have specific tour times).Being British, we were looking forwards to learning about this piece of British history. I have to say that the proud institution of Cunard and indeed British maritime heritage would be ashamed of the shambles of an attraction that the current management are running.A huge disappointment. Glad we managed to successfully turn other people away on the way to the ticket office and save their money and time.",Quaver_raver
40,dining experance,one of the best stakes I ever had. cooked at my table. the atmosphere is very special. along with the history makes a evening you won't forget,Ed H
30,Worthwhile experience,"We stayed one overnight on the Queen Mary and had a ball exploring the ship. Self guided tour weren't going on due to renovations but we leaned a lot from exploring on our own. The room of ship models was quite interesting.Our stateroom had a very comfortable bed with high quality linens. The view from the port holes was wonderful. Even though not everything worked like new,staying on the Queen Mary was a historic adventure!",Anne M
50,Incredible sights,"This is a one-of-a-kind attraction, a combination historic ship, hotel, and banquet/meeting facility. We visited on a weekday and it was not at all busy. There's a ton to explore on your own, or they had two guided tours available and I believe a longer tour to go looking for ghosts late at night. If you book a room there, you have pretty much the run of the ship, though tours cost extra. (When we went, the website said that you get an audio tour free and discounts on the guided tours if you are a hotel guest. But the audio tour was down and we got one guided tour at no cost.)I'm a skeptic so to me the Haunted Encounters tour was only slightly spooky, focusing on stories that were told to them by guest and staff, and occasionally debunking them.The only intimidating part was going to the bow of the ship, which was run-down and nearly pitch black. The first-class swimming pool was being repaired, so we couldn't see it, unfortunately.Our tour guide for the Glory Days tour was quirky, to say the least, and the spiel was a bit weird, focusing on details like the names of many types of obscure wood used on the ship. The highlight was visiting the Queen's Salon, formerly the first-class lounge, which was stunning. You can see a lot of the ship without booking a tour, but the tour is a good way to get some history.The engine room and general history exhibits, and a 4-D movie, are in the stern, and you have to exit the ship to get there. We were told that we could view a movie for free since we were hotel guests. We had only allotted an hour to the area, which was insufficient for us, since we have interest in history. The engine room was expansive and very interesting. Don't miss the doorway to the room where you can view the remaining propeller. It's huge! After the engine room comes the actual museum exhibits, which we had to kind of rush through due to time constraints.Food was on the expensive side and I wasn't impressed by it (we didn't eat at the fancy Sir Winston's or the famous Sunday brunch) but you're paying for location.If you're not staying here, I think the admission and tours can be a bit pricey. I think it would also be a challenging place for those with mobility problems, because the easiest (and I think in some cases the only) way to get around is often stairs. It's certainly not impossible (someone who used a wheelchair was on one of our tours) but it didn't seem very easy.We stayed the night and had an absolutely wonderful time on board. I think it's worth seeing, and if you are interested in art deco and/or ships and/or history, like I am, you should love it.",Loves_the_rails
50,Wonderful Piece of History,My son and I visited here while vacationing in the Los Angeles area. We did the afternoon Ghost Tour which was so much fun. We then explored the ship after eating lunch in the Chowder House which is excellent by the way. It was so cool exploring this iconic ship. Just seeing and feeling the history all around us was an amazing experience. This is a must see if in the LA area.,tedlong29
50,interesting,"We took the haunted tour of the ship. It was informative and quite fun. Got lots of interesting facts and saw parts of the ship that others might not see. The ship is now a hotel. The workmanship on it is beautiful. We didn't get to see a ghost,tho!",Cheri
30,Nice One time Visit,"The tour was interesting, but limited.Would have enjoyed seeing a current stateroom.I understand it is currently a hotel, but would think there would be one room available to see briefly.We also had tea upstairs in the Sun Deck Room.The atmosphere was disappointing, empty an not decorated at all.The food was mediocre.Staff was friendly and attentive",Italia2go
50,A 'must see' place,I'm a sucker for these kinds of attractions and the Queen is one of the best. It's getting old and there has lately been talks about it needing major repairs. I hope they find the money because it would be a shame to lose her.,Pat B
30,Overpriced Brunch,"Traveled 100 miles from Escondido for the Sunday brunch and was really disappointed. The food was fine, a good variety, and plenty of it. But for $130 plus tip (for 2) I was expecting more elegance and more sophisticated food choices. The Mexican bar was black beans, ground beef, taco makings, etc.; the Chinese was sweet and sour pork, fried rice; the Italian was 3 different kinds of pasta. If you are used to the grand dining rooms of today's modern ships, the low ceiling dining room was a shock - almost felt like a high school cafeteria. I could have saved the 200 mile round trip and had as good a brunch locally.",Keeper40
50,Excellent brunch,Brunch was lavish and the service outstanding. We then roamed around the ship for a while afterwards.,CKM1991
40,There's TWO SECTIONS to the Queen Mary,"I went to the Queen Mary after visiting the Aquarium. I wish that I skipped the Aquarium and went right to the QM. It's good for adults, not kids. There are TWO entrances, TWO sections to the QM. One is for the engine room area and the other is for the rest of the ship, the staterooms, the dining rooms, etc. I specifically asked the lady at the entrance to the engine area if there was anything else to see, because I wanted to see the staterooms and the fancy part of the ship the guests lived in. She said that there was nothing else, except for the sample guest rooms above the engine room. She insisted that was it. I asked her in different ways THREE TIMES!!!! My sister had been on the QM tour years ago and knew about the second entrance and took me outside to the second entrance. Unfortunately, we didn't leave ourselves enough time to see the fancy part of the ship. There was a tour of the ship that we were too tired to see because of all of the time we wasted at the Aquarium and we were just worn out. Skip the aquarium, schedule enough time for the QM tour, leave the kids at home, make sure you see both parts of the ship. The Engine part isn't good if you have bad knees. There are several staircases. My sister couldn't do the engine part but I could and I need a knee replacement. The engine part is really cool if you are at all mechanically wonky.",upstny
50,Never saw a ship so old!,"It was really eye opening to see this ship and learn the history. Takes a good 3 hours to see everything. Also, did the night tour to see into places you can't go on your own. Worth doing and sitting down for a drink.",Marie L
40,Imagine being at sea!,The Queen gives you the feeling that you are on her at sea. You can imagine women in long dresses and men in derbies walking the wide decks. We took the historic tour which was interesting but you spend a very long time standing...the whole tour. Many exhibits were closed due to repair along with the bridge and other outdoor areas. The repairs were also noisy. If you have never been there it is indeed worth going.,Mobleynshadow
30,Queen needs work.....,"Am rating the Queen down, as she needs work. The ship itself has a wide and fascinating history. But she has been neglected for the last 10 years or so...and it is showing.Sunday Brunch is still first class and delish. Have not stayed in the rooms for quite some time, so am unsure the condition. The art deco bar is still a great place to have drinks and admire the surroundings. The view on deck is still beautiful. The city of Long Beach has started repairs.",deleecox
40,Beautiful historic ship,"I was amazed at how beautiful the QM is. She is being overhauled and will someday be back to her grand self. Walking the decks and thinking of all the famous people who have been there was truly incredible.We had a twin room with a view of Long Beach. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was really neat. They have the original taps in the bath tub that show hot salt water and cold salt water as well as fresh. They no longer work but it was just another bit of history. The original air vents are still in use and are also an amazing bit of history.All the check in staff were extremely nice and obviously enjoy working on the ship. Have to give a major thanks to Monica who truly went the extra mile when she found out we didn't have hot water in our shower.Truly a ""one of a kind"" hotel.",Wendy V
50,Tour of the Queen Mary,We enjoyed our visit to the retired Queen Mary cruise ship in Long Beach. It was very interesting to see how first class passengers traveled across the Atlantic in the 1930s! Definitely a bygone era. We found the history of the ship very interesting. I would definitely recommend taking a guided tour but after that you have the freedom to walk around ship at your leisure. There is a Russian submarine next to the Queen Mary but unfortunately it is not open for tours at this time.,FMAB78
10,Save your money,"Be warned, this is a huge waste of time and money. The management is rude to their guests and the tour is a royal disappointment, charging much but delivering little.",4Bearcubs
40,2 night stay,stayed for 2 nights and was taken back in time. The ship is old but full of character and the state rooms are large. Breakfast for $18 is not worth the money but the experience is great,karen c
50,More history,"My husband and I cannot get enough history-this was not a disappointment. Went 8 years ago, but still a great memory.",Janetrn_78
40,Allow enough time to wander on your own before or after a tour,Given a choice of the tours offered I would opt for the Glory Days Historical Tour over the Haunted Encounters. Might have been different with another guide...Diana and the audio tours were unavailable during our visit. The history of the ship is amazing and I can only imagine how wonderful the whole experience will be once the renovations are complete. In the meantime take along an extra layer of clothing. Everything was wide open and chilly when we were there though the outside temps were pretty comfortable.,villasouth
40,Good for historical value,This ship is tired and it shows inside and out. But at the same time it reveals great glimpses into history. This was the grand lady of the sea back in the day. Must have been truly special to travel on her when she was in her prime,rightfoot
30,Beautiful ship to stay on for one night,"I made reservations for one evening stay aboard the Queen Mary for our 25th wedding anniversary. When making the reservation, I was told we were getting one of the larger rooms on the ship that had a separate sitting area. When we checked in, I went back to the desk to ask why our room was so small, no seating area and no view of the harbor. I was told it would cost me more for those items? That is what I was led to believe I was getting when making the reservation. The room was nice with all of the woodwork and original amenities. The ship was interesting to walk about, even though the majority of the areas we wanted to see were closed off for renovations. I did read in previous reviews that there were no coffee makers in the room which I did not think was a big deal, but there was also no coffee to be found until 6AM when the onboard Starbucks opened.Our room was across a very narrow hallway to another room. The ladies in there were so very noisy and had their TV turn up loudly until at least 3AM. They also had room service at one point where knocking on their door seemed like it was our door being knocked on. Be prepared for noise.They are in the process of doing a multi year, multi million dollar renovation so be prepared for dust and disruptions.We can say we stayed aboard the Queen Mary, though we will not again.",mustangjeanne
20,Needs updating!,"I knew before staying at the Queen Mary that it was a little less than a four star hotel (more like 3) and that the walls were a little thin. However, when comparing the cost with the other nice hotels in the area, I thought paying $179 per night for a king deluxe room with a view of the beautiful harbor was reasonable compared to the price of the other nice hotels in town (after all, it's the Queen Mary!) I booked for 4 nights and was told the total was $884. Didn't think to much about it at first- then did the math and found I was being charged $168 more than 179 x 4! I called and questioned why and was told there was an occupancy tax of $21.48 and a facilities fee of $16.95, in addition to a couple of other minor taxes. I knew they had some tours on board and exhibits, so I thought the additional charges may be for that. Nope! You still have to pay for the tours (half off so the historic tour is only $11). Also, the Princess Diana exhibit was closed as well as the Sir Winston Churchill restaurant. I felt a little disappointed and felt we should have been notified or gotten a discount. The ship is historic, but I feel it needs to be on a maintenance schedule so everything doesn't need to be closed down at the same time. Rugs should be replaced rather than being repaired with duck tape. I'm glad I saw it, but I don't think I'd go back, unless I got a free ticket to the Princess Diana exhibit, which was closed.",Roxane W
30,Sunday brunch,"Went to the queen Mary Sunday champagne brunch during the Christmas holiday season. It was packed. Amazing array of food, well organized, very festive. Lovely place for a girlfriend get together!",Mubina G
50,Great experience,"I didn't think the meal would be very good, but I went along for the experience of eating on the ship. We ate at Sir Winston's. You can't show up in jeans and a sweatshirt, but I wasn't dressed to the nines. Our meal was perfect! It is expensive, but the meal and walking around the ship after, was worth it.",Idahobeachgal
50,Great History,"We did the historical tour of the Queen Mary. How amazing it was to see the many amenities, learn about the different classes and learn the history of the ship. Our Tour Guide was simply excellent.",Robin W
50,Great fun historical venue,"Whether you have out of town guests or just want a fun place to visit and eat with friends, the Queen Mary still has charm, elegance, a great view of the city skyline, and some really good restaurants. Enjoy!",stredfield
50,Wonderful to tour history!,"Before debarking on a cruise my friend and I spent a few hours among the Queen Mary and it was definitely worth our time. We didn't take an audio or guided tour but instead were able to show ourselves around. There's many signage telling you tidbits of history here and there about the ship. We also had breakfast aboard and many of the staff are willing to tell you some more history about the ship. If you're into history or ships, I would definitely recommend adding this onto your itinerary.",BZornes
10,Trap,"I visited the ship in Feb and was not impressed with the service or management. We booked a audio tour and had to walk up the stairs as the elevators were not operational, this was a daunting task as I use a cane. Once on board we had to located the tour office without any assistance and were told that the tour had been cancelled as it was raining and the equipment was not being issued for the tour. To complicate matters we were told that we could not get a refund and had to argue with the supervisor in order to obtain it and they still wanted to charge a booking fee. Parking is not free and non refundable.",Maallatuq
40,Quick self guided tour,"The ship was lovely to walk around; however, we came when there was a Scottish festival, and the ship was full of people playing their bagpipes in preparation for the competition. One bagpipe player is enough to fill the air with music, fifteen constantly playing all around the ship was another story. Nevertheless, it was worth the ten dollars, and there is a lot of history to take in about the ship. Ideal for couples, but kids probably wouldn't appreciate the historical nature of the tour.",Stacie L
50,What a lovely experience,"We had a suite which was so quaint, plenty of room and so authentic. We ate at Sir Winston's, and the food and staff were excellent. Took the paranormal tour which was very interesting. Overall, a beautiful experience!",Jeanne B
50,Most amazing experience,"Took a tour into the depths of this fabulous oceanliner and saw things most people don't unless you take guided tours. I am a total history/antique fan, so this was a delight for me. Very large and you can go back for another trip through and still see new things you missed before. I will definitely go back. Docked right next to Carnival Cruiselines home port.",adventurewoman2011
50,Great experience,Stopped for a few days on the ship. Toured the ship with the headphones provided and can highly recommend.,goldbrew
30,"Fun visit, but most rooms were closed","We visited the ship during the Scottish festival. Parking was difficult because of this, and also made employees scarce. Because of this a lot of the rooms were blocked off and unable to see. It is unfortunate because its not a cheap place to visit. The history of this ship is great, just wish we could have seen more of it.",April C
20,"Good for Adults, 2 Hours MAX, but ROBBERY Parking and Expensive Entry!","We had LA Let's Go passes so we didn't pay the $27.00 each entry fee, but after doing it, I would value this attraction around $15 based on normal tourist activities. There really aren't many other ships left like this in the world that are moderately intact. The outside of the ship is the most impressive and you could see for free. For your entry charge you can walk around the ship which does have some admittedly cool ballrooms and areas, but because this is a functioning hotel, it is mixed in with modern furniture, modern TVs, etc. The giant LEGO ship was cool. The 1-hour ""Glory Days"" tour was a good 1-hour overview (lots of walking up and down stairs for those with mobility issues FYI). Disappointing we could not see a single guest room.Worst of all was when trying to exit after only being their 90 minutes - $18.00 parking charge. Mind you, this is a huge open area with tons of parking so they are clearly just price gauging the tourists. Quite the RIP-OFF.So, if you can get 1/2 price tickets and figure out how to not get screwed over by their parking sham, it is a decent way to spend a few hours.",usflyer
40,Golden age tour is well worth it!,"A charming old ship that takes you back in time. Impressive art deco styling. I'm glad we took a tour, to show us different parts. Our guide, James, was a great character. Be sure to go down to the engine area too. We also saw the 4-D movie, but beware, you might get wet!",BlueSpruce80
40,Great place to stay if you enjoy the history of the Seas,"Amazing to stay in such a historic Cruise, the up keep must be difficult and very expensive so in my opinion it wasn't great but acceptable.Maybe because of the time of the year there were not many people staying for that the lack of atmosphere.Worth the experience",zabala2016
30,A Great Ship to Visit but Visiting it is a Challenge,"The Queen Mary is a spectacle of 1930's ship technology and vividly displays the grace of different time. There are however, 2017 issues that need to be solved to help improve the visitor's experience. First is directional signs and parking. When entering the Queen Mary gate, there is an automated ticket machine where pulling the ticket is no big deal, then it gets interesting as there is no signage telling you where to park. This is compounded in the dark. We did see what looked like parking attendants in the distance but they did nothing to tell us where to go. As I passed them, I started to turn right but noticed some very faded arrows in the pavement indicating I should go the other way. Again, the parking attendants were talking with each other while one was engrossed with their phone. Seeing some cars up ahead, I followed them and found an open lot with spaces. Still the entire parking area is not lit well and needs upgrading. There is discount for parking if you eat at one of the restaurants. If you want to eat however, you will be paying a $20.00 per person admission fee for the ship itself. I am guessing that hotel guests won't pay this fee. Another improvement would be to post prices somewhere where they can be seen. I have visited the QM many times in the past. So, I looked for changes from over 5 years ago and not much has changed. We headed for the Chelsea Chowder Bar as it was the only open restaurant. We had a 45 minute wait and decided to take our self guided tour. Many parts of the ship were showing signs of wear but it also appeared that some maintenance was going on. I still marvel at the magnificent 1930's maritime technology as well as walking where such people as Winston Churchell, Bob Hope and many others trod. Our dinner was at the Chelsea was ok. We had the Fish & Chips and an Angus Burger as well as Guinness. The prices were a bit steep but then we enjoyed a marvelous view and decor of a former era",Richard B
50,Cool history stop,Was in the area for a music festival and decided to stop thru to check it out. Pretty interesting step back in time. Tours are available but we just strolled around on our own. Decent way to kill a lil time.,Skip Hicks
40,Wicked,"We didn't sleep on the Queen Mary, but we did take a quick tour throughout the ship. The air quality was not very good at all the afternoon we walked through. The ship itself sure has a lot of history for sure & we enjoyed taking a peek inside.",Brenda M
50,Great experience,"Our business association for innkeepers had a 3 day meeting on the Queen Mary. We weren't able to get a room, but we very much enjoyed the meetings and the hospitality onboard the Queen Mary. Will go back and stay some time.",MikeThrift
50,Place to visit definitely,"It's a jewel in a cruise line history. It is a hotel, a restaurant a monument. it is a Museum.you can see from the old engine room to the bridge, with decks and promenade to admire. I live on a new built cruise liners, but this gives you a goose bumps. I was thrilled to see the inside of the Queen Marry. I will not post photos, if you have a chance, go see it.",Edvin K
40,"A unique tour, and interesting dining experience.","My niece was absolutely set on seeing the Queen Mary and going on the paranormal tour. We did a little research and we just could not fit the 11:30pm tour on our schedule, so we opted to go during the day and seeing the Haunted tour. We purchased our tickets and checked in at the tour desk. Since we had about an hour before the tour, we opted to go to the Observation Lounge for a drink and snack before the event. First, we observed that there were not nearly enough chairs for the number of tables they had. So we had to go borrow chairs from other groups to be able get a seat. The server was a delight (I'm so sorry I can't remember her name), but she was the only server for more than 20 tables. She recommended the perfect beverages for a warm Saturday afternoon, and we ordered wings and nachos. Unfortunately, it took over 30 minutes for the wings and nachos to arrive - literally 5 minutes before our tour started. We wolfed them down, but it was really awkward. They should at least let you know how much time it takes to get food.The tour was definitely the highlight - I believe our tour guide's name was Dustin. What a great voice - what a great tour guide. Fabulous knowledge, great facts and stories - with the right balance between storyteller and historian.It was a lovely day - and we would recommend it to others. Getting around with a knee injury was a little bit of a challenge - LOTS of steps.",Nancy SC
50,An Ocean Voyage On the Shore,"The luxurious Queen Mary still captures the feeling of serene glamour of it's day. With careful attention to details, you'll find such historic charm used in its decorative aesthetic that simply no longer exists today. Note the extensive use of veneer from exotic woods found throughout the world or the brass handles on doorways. To truly understand the essense of what makes this ship so wonderful, you'll need to purchase tickets for the historic tour! Although, word to the wise - Skip out on the ghost tour, as it offers more laughs from its cheesiness than scares.",Thomas G
10,DIRTY!!! SEE PHOTOS,"We stayed One night,thank goodness. We complained that our room was dirty after booking in and were assured it would be cleaned by our return in the evening. All that had been done was they put Clean towels in bathroom. It was 11:00pm too tired to go back to reception.Complained on our departure the next morning, just given the brush off very rood",holiday149
50,Nice floating hotel,"the ship looks like a small mall form the inside, we got a tour, and our tour guide James was just outstanding, the way he talks and makes us laugh is just amazing. We would recommend the tour to get an overview of the amazing history this ship has been through.",HR8283
50,Art Deco masterpiece,Step back into another time to see traveling how it used to be. Showing age but worth a visit. The observation bar alone is worth your time. Various tours available for all tastes/budgets..Highly recommend.,travelgalAvon
30,Mixed feelings on year 5 of CHILL,"So it was quite the surprise at this years CHILL, no ice ! who wudda thunk that ! First 4 years were marvelous ice sculptures we all expected the same, and from the sound of it everyone did. No indication in the adds that it would be so radically changed. So when entering.. at first i thought what an amazing entrance to the ICE KINGDOM they had created a wonderful Alice extravagant entrance with fun little areas for entertainment plus some extremely good and friendly actors... but then... it was over.... no ice at all.. what a disappointment. Yes what they did was good ... but it wasn't CHILL , not the expectation... what will ya'll do next year now ? who knows but we'll all be a bit suspect. It's way better when you get an early bird, but we won't know what it is getting the early bird tickets... so may have to wait for a group on type deal i dunno. Still like the overall design they do on the exterior , it's still fun... but we so miss the ice : o (",northernk
10,Freezing Cold in Room,"I slept with all my clothes on and still couldn't get warm. When I complained, they said they updated the heating system! Since when, I asked. The receptionist smiled and t hen wouldn't refund my deposit when I wanted to leave before my departure date. Unacceptable to say the least. Do not stay there during a mild Southern California winter.",Kathryn H C
30,Winter time AC,"It is nice and gas great history. Great to say we have been here. However, it is very overpriced but you are paying for the name and luxury of saying you stayed here. Room was mediocre at best. Very worn. Central heating and the AC was perpetually on. Said something to the front desk and they didn't do anything other than say it is central heat for a bank of 15 rooms.if you have other options and I would only stay here to say I have been here but they have tours you can do without staying here.",Loretta A
40,A great piece of living history,"We did not stay at the hotel but spent four days as attendees of a small conference aboard the ship. While the property is past its prime and the food is just fine (for a ship), we were very impressed by the efforts put in to keep the history of the Queen Mary alive -- the self-guided tour is a MUST if you have two hours to spare. Highly informative, educational and entertaining at times.",djglobetrotting
50,Nice place to stay before the cruise,"I stayed here at the hotel. Though the rooms are dated, I guess it is on purpose. You feel the spirit of the time when Queen Mary was a cruise ship. You can feel how it was. Just walking around the ship is fine. It makes you feel back in 30s. I enjoyed the experience",AlisaPoly
40,Visit History,Decided at the last minute to visit this attraction since I was in the LA area and I wasn't disappointed. Took the Haunted History tour (included with the $32 ticket price) and saw parts of the ship not on the regular tour. The tour guide was knowledgeable and entertaining. There was also a self-guided audio tour (also included with the ticket) that enables you to take your time and view many features of this beautiful and classic part of our past. I had a drink and snack in the art deco bar and what was supposed to be a brief stop on my itinerary turned into several hours. I intend to go back and stay in the hotel and see a little more of the ship my next time in town. I highly recommend it.,Charles H
20,Shabby,The tour areas have got progressively shabbier over the years and the ship is probably on the cusp of being unrestorable.A lot of the areas are covered in seagull droppings and rust. Probably best to see it now before it's gone...,FullFonz
50,Educational,"We paid for a tour. We had a group of 20 or so. Our tour guide was very ""colorful."" He was nice and very funny. I would definitely recommend to others! A must see for the area!",Renee B
40,Worth a walk around,My husband's uncle had a room on the ship so we spent some time exploring it with him one afternoon. I really enjoyed doing so! The art deco aesthetic is just fabulous and I really felt the magic and history of it.,laurengineered
50,Well worth the stop,We spent a full day at the Queen Mary. We bought the Grand Passport and utilized all the services but the self guided audio. We just ran out of time between our tours. Fascinating history... so great if you are a history buff. The Haunted Encounters brought us to areas of the ship guest do not get to see unless doing this tour. Surprised they brought us below ship where safety features were lacking. Part of the ship is actually a hotel and we got to see some of the rooms. Not sure I would want to stay in them though.,Rita D
50,Legendary Liner,"I am an ocean liner fan and recently spent one night on the Queen Mary following a cruise. During my stay, I enjoyed touring the ship. The tour is very interesting, but the ship needs some work (the exterior desperately needs to be painted). Also, the dining options currently are very limited (the Promenade Cafe and Sir Winston's were closed). The shopping area recently has been improved. I am always thrilled to be aboard this ship!",Charles J
40,Historic Queen Mary,"We were able to visit the Queen Mary with our family for free, since they were staying the night on the ship. I don't know that I would have paid to come on board.It was fun being able to look around the ship and imagine the people who had been on board years ago.",Sunlady56
40,The Queen Mary,We enjoyed visiting the Queen Mary the morning before we left for a cruise out of San Pedro. There is an informative audio tour which makes the experience much more interesting. I was amazed that the Queen Mary had been used as a troop ship after WWII. There are many old photos of this era and also the many Hollywood starts who enjoyed voyages on the Queen Mary. We didn't use the hotel; it might be fun!,Karen S
40,Fun time for sure,Rooms are a bit small. We asked to be upgraded. It was $20. Well worth it. Rooms are fun and a total throwback. You can walk around and take tours if you are into that. Or just walk around and explore by yourself. There are free shuttles to and from the city. 92 north and south takes you back in forth.,Anastasi M

30,Historical Tour,"We took the historical tour of the Queen Mary. Fascinating to see the old,pictures, the wedding chapel, the salons for first class passengers. I would have been interested in seeing the second and third class areas but they were not on the tour. Interesting to see the ship but we found it rather pricey. ($56 for 2 senior tickets) .",roytan1947

40,Fun,Impressive ship. Couldn't see a cabin unfortunately. Quite a big ship. If you come for a conference you can get in for free for a self tour,JackTheTraveller
50,A must see for any history lover,"Please pay for the tours, you won't regret it. I did the Glory Days tour and the Ghost tour which were both fun and informative. We also stopped at the bar and enjoyed some great cocktails. Everything about this ship is insanely cool and if you enjoy visiting historical sites, this is a must do.I will definitely be returning someday for their famous brunch and maybe even a stay in their hotel.",Cryptic_Tourist
40,Great way to spend the day,"We spent several hours touring the Queen Mary and really enjoyed every minute. We took the audio self guided tour first. It was great to go at our ""own speed"" and be able to hear the narration. Then we took the ""Glory Days"" guided tour which took us to areas of the ship not on the guided tour. The guide also told many anecdotes about people and happenings during the ship's history. I thought the tour cost were very reasonable and they offer military and senior discounts. However, the cost to park, $18, is ridiculous. The ship does need some TLC, but renovations were being worked on in several areas when we were there.",js_mo_50

40,Interesting piece of history docked off Long Beach,"Like a replica of the Titanic from the film. They sailed during the same time period in history. Mahogany rails, beautiful furnishings, and grand staircases. Had a lunch here. My sister went up to the front and said she should scream I'm the king of the world like Leo. Very interesting to see the anchor room with the huge boiler. Actually eerie because there's this huge portion in the room where you look down meters into the ocean and finally you see this anchor. Professional staff for guides and good service at lunch. Beautiful views of the ocean from the ship deck.",mariedesjardins
50,A Glimps of the Past,"We spent a relaxing afternoon wandering the decks of the Queen Mary. We opted for the self tour using headphones, which was very informative. It spotlighted 10 areas of the ship on all floors and the outside decks. We also took a 1 hour guided history tour. How interesting that the ship was stripped during the World War ll to ferry the armed forces to Europe. After the war,16,000 troops were squeezed aboard to come home. After the war, they returned the luxurious decor and returned to moving guests back and forth to Europe. We had drinks and appetizers in The Observation Bar, good service and food. They were preparing for a wedding and New Years Eve Galas, so the ship was busy with workers setting up.We were disappointed that we couldn't actually see any of the staterooms, but we were told the hotel was sold out. The Princess Diana exhibit was also closed, which was also disappointing.All in all, we would recommend seeing this luxurious piece of history.",Bernadette H
50,A short visit.,Only had a couple of hours so my wife and I did a self walking tour. A beautiful ship with so much history. Definitely need to return to go on the guided tour.,Ronald F
20,Mixed Bag and over-priced,"The Glory Days tour was fun and informative. If you are a hotel guest ask for the discount. Tickets are then $11, not $30. Warning: You won't get this discount unless you ask for it.The Ghost Shipwalk is a scam. For $44 a person, you expect to hear good ghost stories from the ship's heyday. Nope. The tour guide kept asking us if we saw anything weird, and then going on how on other tours the guests said they saw ghosts and heard voices. The guide wanted us to supply the chills!What a crock!",Allison R
20,Disappointing,"I was in Long Beach specifically to see the Queen Mary. I had been warned it was in a sad state of disrepair. As much as it costs to visit it makes one wonder how that money is spent. All that said I am glad I took the tour as it is a piece of my family history, however, I will not visit again.",thisisridicul0us
50,Historical must-see,"We loved touring the Queen Mary during our short stay in Long Beach. We only took the Glory Days guided tour, and the Diana exhibit was closed, but we found it really interesting.

40,Piece of History,"LOOK FOR DISCOUNTED TICKETS/GROUPONS!We went to see this wonderful historic ship and take a tour over the weekend. We selected the basic ticket and the historic tour. Our guide, James, was interesting and spoke in such a way that captivated his listeners. Unfortunately, he did not provide as many factoids as I would have liked. This historic tour took you on a few levels of the ship and then we were able to wander most of the rest of the ship by ourselves. There were some parts that we didn't/couldn't see and I would assume that was because it was part of another tour for which you had to pay (i.e. the single remaining swimming pool). I thought the top level with the captain's quarters and information about what happened in those rooms was the most interesting. Those are the type of historical bits I find interesting.I was not interested in the haunted tour at all and found myself leery of certain parts of the ships, like the propeller room.",tink8009
30,History abound,"A very interesting attraction that is a museum , hotel restaurant and tour . This is a unique type of place full of history you can see and stay on board with very historic rooms. Several restaurant choices all on the ship . Guided tours available and gift shops for your shopping pleasure. Paid parking prices change based on events .",Russ V
20,The majestic ship looked sad and uncared for,The ship dominates Long Beach but is fast becoming an eye sore.

Started at the buffet which was great, but would recommend making a tour of all of the food stations before making your selections since there are too many choices.Ship tour was ok, but did not got to alot of the more interesting places. Public areas of the ship were very cold which made the visit not as enjoyable as it could have been.The overall condition of the ship could be improved, however, lots of peeling paint on the outside and saw many areas that could use sprucing up.",Richard R
50,Best bruch EVER,"Our tour included a visit/tour of the QM. Docent walked us around and provided background history on QM and how it served wartime efforts and eventually ended up at Long Beach. It is permanently docked and has hotel rooms, tours, and restaurant. We did tour then had that most elaborate brunch I've ever experienced: stations for means, salads, soups, seafood, desserts -- all to die for. Would definitely go back just for the buffet. This was the high bar measure that the rest of our eating experiences was compared to (and none stood up to it). Staff and servers were absolutely perfect as well.",offkilter2016
40,Let your imagination go so you can bring history back to life!,"I found it very helpful to read up on the history of the Queen Mary before going to Long Beach and participating on the tours. The tours were great but short, but gave my family additional intriguing information. The haunted tour was nothing to boast about - even though it is probably the best money maker for intrigued and curious minds.Beautiful ship, and a great place to stay, and beautiful photo spot.Wander at your own leisure and you can purchase the tour that allows you to go at your own pace with headphones - Highly suggest.I would consider this a whole day event so you can eat on the ship and enjoy their cuisine after wandering through the decks.Relax and let your imagination go to work.",maschiquita

40,A Great Liner,This is a very good look at a great ocean liner with a fabulous past in the world. It is certainly part of the heritage for the era that she sailed in. It is well worth the look especially if your a ship lover a lot of her original appearance is maintained and so one can get a feel for the grandeur of travelling aboard such a great liner and the times people would have had aboard her whilst she was in service. It is almost like a Titanic attraction with the exception that you can actually stay aboard her as she is a fully functioning hotel.,Enda C
40,Large group for lunch,"Short staffed for holiday meal- ran out of desserts.Ship full of history & tour quite interesting. Amazing facts & figures, esp during the war.It is now 'home' in Long Beach..a grand dame that guards the city & sits majestically in the harbor.I preferred the breakfast tour; smaller & food better.

10,Queen Mary New Years Eve Party,"What a horrible event. They oversold this event. Absolutely no place to sit in any of the venues to enjoy the entertainment. You had to pay hundreds of dollars extra to get a seat anywhere. People just walked aimlessly around the boat. People were sitting on stairs and on the floor in random places. Entertainment (live music and DJs) was basically either hip hop/Top 40 or salsa. Nothing geared to the 40's to 50's crowd. The one area that had a piano player was a small hole in wall room with only a couple of tables and no bar or food service. The other jazz type club was so packed they were turning people away. Bartenders were slow and poorly trained. There was absolutely no security at the coat check...the place they stored the coats was all open to the main ball room seating area in the back and coats were not even hung up. To add insult, two days before the event they offered a 25% off coupon code. Parking was $25. This was just a awful event....so bad I should sue to get my money back...it was that bad!!",general5star1962
40,Sunday brunch is awesome,"The brunch alone is worth coming here. We also had a short guided tour but it did not include many of the areas. There is not a lot of signage on the ship and even with a map, it is not easy to know what can be accessed. Perhaps it was more limited than usual because it was New Years Day and there had been a large celebration on board the day before.",WhisperedInsights
50,Fascinating ship with a lovely Sunday Brunch!,"I first visited this ship during a Scottish festival then watched a documentary about it's history on Smithsonian. Wow, it's really had a great life and I love walking the halls to get the feel of how things used to be during it's lifetime.The Champaign Sunday brunch is really nice. It's very elegant and impressive. Well worth a visit.",bonitadc

30,Worth visiting if you have the time but don't feel sad if you miss it,"The ship is huge but unfortunately most of the parts are closed and you can't actually see too much. Furthermore, they had run out of audio guides when we were there. The engine room tour in the bottom is the most interesting part of the ship and gives you an idea how the life has been on the ship earlier.",Titta K
10,Save your money,"We bought the package for the Aquarium and the Queen Mary. The Aquarium is great, but they don't tell you that you that you have to wait in another line at the Queen Mary to get a time for a tour which turned out to be 4 hours later from when we arrived at the Queen Mary. We found the ship to be in a poor state of repair with significant examples of metal and wood rot everywhere. Doors were locked and it was difficult to find the ways to get to the open areas. We had to hunt for access to the bridge. They make you get off the ship climb up and down other set of stairs to get to the engine room. The brochure showed a Diana exhibit but it was closed. We found trash on the floors in areas. We found chairs and other furniture just stacked in areas. We found dingy white carpet laying on one of the top decks. It seemed that with the locked doors that there were likely fire code violations. My recommendation is to save your money and skip it.",James K
50,MFS Queen Mary,"MFS stands for most fun ship EVER! Why? Me and my wife wanted to go over there for years. So, we went there with my nephew who is visiting for the week and once we got onboard it was fabulous! We got the First Class Passport and we booked the 4:15 history tour and the 6:30 Haunted Encounters Tour. The history tour covered most of the ship history like the 1st class dining room, smoking room, the children's playroom, bar, and the bridge. Horn blasts are typically about 2 hours to blow. At 6:30 during the encounters tour which included the paranormal walk and investigation. After the tours and the 4d theater my son can hardly sleep during the trip home. I can tell. It was fun!",Lyndon A
50,Great for history and food,"If you like history this is a must see. Things are still in their original decor. Had a very entertaining host, James. He could keep even the children's attention. The restaurant had very good tasting food and good service.",Raelene K
10,Did not enjoy the visit!,"Overall did not have a great experience. First of all the lady (her first name was Roxanne) at the ticket counter was quite rude. She was selling tickets. I realized she was busy, but she needs to learn how to be patient and be nice to customers. She displayed no interest in explaining anything about the ticket or how to plan the visit. I was really annoyed at her behaviour.There was a VERY long wait in line for the POLAR EXPRESS show. Someone should at least mention the wait times, so people can plan ahead. I saw lots of people leaving after waiting for a while.I think the staff needs more training to make these visits more memorable for tourists...",rajpriya99
40,Worthwhile venture into history,"We did the self-guided tour of the Queen Mary a few weeks ago that included the ""haunted tour"". It was enjoyable waling the decks and seeing the history associated with this grand vessel as we stepped back in time. The haunted tour was different but enjoyable and a bit of fun. I suppose depends on how liberal you want to let your mind run. Still a good experience overall",David N
40,Great stop lots to see,"Plenty of history and memorabilia. Wear those walking shoes and get your 10,000 steps on the ship alone. See first second and third class experiences. Head for the engine room and see the propeller box.We took the haunted encounters tour. Good storytelling from a very capable docent. Covered the most well-known ghost story spots - cool but would have been more memorable if we had been able to see more off best spots. Also swimming pool is closed for renovation - one of the most notorious spots for paranormal activity.Also would be cool if there was open viewing of the main salon. Too bad not the case.When in Long Beach doing touristy things this should be on the list.",TFamLLL
40,Fun day trip - take the History Tour to get the most out of your visit,"I really enjoyed my visit to the Queen Mary. The self-guided audio tour is a fun way to see the ship, and I was really impressed by the classic art deco interior and overall grandeur of the ship. A truly unique perspective into a bygone age. I also went on the ""history tour"", and the guide was very engaging and knowledgeable, and during the tour I got to see several of the ballrooms and salons, which are richly decorated with impressive artwork and murals. Finally, the Observation Bar is a fun place to round out the day with relaxing beverage will taking in the Long Beach Skyline. A few minor gripes, a visit is relatively pricey when you factor in parking ($18) and the cost of admission $25 (AAA discount helps a bit), and parts of the boat are showing signs of deterioration and could do with some TLC.",SM_burghound
40,Great historical place,"We booked on Groupon a two stay. The coupon included an interior room with king size bed and tour passport. The room walls are thin and you could hear the neighbors talking and tv. The ship history and paranormal tours were fun and informative. We were upgraded to an ocean view room while checking in at no additional charge. Great view of the Long Beach harbor and ocean. We ate breakfast and dinner at the on-board restaurant, Chelseas Chowder House. The food was good but over priced.I would recommend taking the time to see this historical ship whenever in the Long Beach California area.",UtahKoosh
40,"Great place to see the sunset, skyline and the ship!","This is a ship converted to tourist spot and hotel. You can get a admission ticket and go about your own way or get some tours.They have 2 guided tour options and a self audio tour. All of them sell out fast, so book in advance.The best spot is the deck, you can see the Long Beach skyline and enjoy sunset. Expect to spend half a day here.They have paid parking in the vicinity and they also have a Starbucks on board.",Kaj978
10,Chill Queen Mary has no chill,"I think my review will echo others below. Very disappointing. I took family here because we loved the ice sculptures in years past. I promised my 4 year old nice such fun only to find out that Alice was not an add on but a replacement. This was totally misleading and quite a disappointment. All the other activities were okay but not worth the price. Also, if you choose not to spend an extra $15 to avoid lines, expect your children to be disappointed and frustrated by the long lines. Lastly, they added a lot of extra activities that cost money, cocoa and stories, gingerbread houses, overpriced drinks. I definitely won't be going back.",Susan W
10,There were no ice sculptures and only one slide. This time you had to pay for ice skating along with the admission,"We came December 27th 2016 and we were getting ready for really cold trip, with all the ice sculptures we went into the dome looking for the ice sculptures. But they didn't have it. That was the reason why we went, instead they had this lame Alice in winterpoop thing that made no sense. We will never go back again. We payed for the admission already but we had to pay 15$ just for ice skating. If I summed this trip up in one word it would be: ""TRRRRRAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😡😨👎🏿💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 never go there people. This place is the worst now! I had the worst time of my good life, oops now it's my bad life. Get rekt m8",Daniel L
40,KB,"Went to Chill. Not worth the money. It was ok, but definitely to pricey for what there was.The Queen Mary which was included in the price of Chill was very good. I have done the tour before but never at Christmas. Several Christmas trees decorated in different themes on the Promenade deck. wonderful museum with great history and exhibits.",Kyle B
50,Great Old Lady,"It was fun to tour the old ship as well as stay in the hotel. Definitely worth a visit. Unfortunately the Lady Diana exhibit was closed when we were there, so I will have to go back again to see all her dresses. The visit the actual engine was amazing and to see the giant propeller.Take the ghost tour as you get to see parts of the ship you wouldn't normally.Also do stop for afternoon tea in The Tea Room!",BornToTravelBrit
30,Historical,A great piece of history although the hotel is a little run down. The tour is interesting but may not appeal to teenagers n young kids. The village is not much,Golfer26
50,Good stay,We stayed at the queen Mary hotel for two nights. Interesting experience. The unguided tour is included for hotel guests.,Amrkata
30,Historic/Sleepless,"The staff is super nice and helpful. The ship was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. The history here is fun to geek out on. I absolutely loved exploring the ship. The problem is the ship is like 70 years old. The walls are extremely thin. I spent most of my first nigh listening to my neighbors talk to their kids, while the kids were watching Spongebob. Yes, the walls are that thin. I found out the next day that this was the number one complaint of guests that stayed the night (hotel staff told me this!). And going out and about the next morning, I could tell by overhearing other's conversations, my wife and I's experience was not unique that nigh.I do suggest you check out the ship. I suggest you stay elsewhere, though, if you want to spend the night. (I loved the Hotel Maya, which was very close by). The rooms are too expensive to have to be sleepless all night. I suppose if you go to bed late, it's probably not much of a problem, but I don't, so it bothered me.",Antonio Anderso... R
40,Queen Mary & Princess Dianna,"Definitely worth the time. Definitely take a tour or you could get lost. We enjoyed the Princess Dianna exhibit, lots of Royal Family memorabilia.",amgrahek
50,I LOVED Alice in Winterland!,"Anyone who was disappointed with this year's Chill is just not realistic in expectation. First of all, the whole Alice in Winterland theme was done in spectacular fashion If you are a designer or event planner, or even have ever put on a theme party, you have to know how fabulously this was done. The rest of the Chill experience is fine for families with children to have fun. I am a big fan of the Queen Mary, so I considered it a plus to have access to the ship as well. The prices are not cheap, but you could go ahead and $100 if you want Disneyland.",86michealb
10,NOT CHILL!!! False Advertisement!,"I want to be clear, this review is for the 2016 Queen Mary Chill, Alice in Winterland., not the actual Queen Mary Ship, which is a beautiful piece of history.I am one of the many, many people upset by the corporate ""false advertisement""For those that have been to the Chill event in previous years and expect to see the beautiful ice sculptures DO NOT waste your money and time. They did without this year BUT kept the misleading name ""Chill"" instead you get to walk through an overly warm maze-like Alice in Wonderland scene made with fabric shape with background light. A complete disappointment, specially when my family and another family that went with us brought more people because we liked it so much last year. I do not buy the excuse that corporate wanted to do a more interactive experience for young children and older people (""because it was too cold before"") RIDICULOUS!!! My kids and all the people that I know and been before loved going into the sub-zero walk through, is the whole purpose of going to CHILL, if it was too cold for you... go walk downtown Disney. This was most likely an increase if price by the company that does the ice sculptures and corporate NOT wanting to negotiate. I hope they get all the money they wanted this year because next year if this does not go back to the ice sculptures, the event will be empty. Word is spreading... they will not be able to sell an event as ""Chill"" any longer.",Erica A
40,Interesting,We took the Queen Mary haunted tour and it was fun for all. The stories were great and the guide was great. I believe it could have been better with more stops on the tour as it was less than one hour. It was very interesting,Kelly B
20,Disapointed,"Long time since I have been here, and I was disappointed, as the price was raising and the only change had been the Lego Model of the vessel and a little in the engine room.Special when I have see the beautiful vessel ion Yokohama for 3 week's ago",kjell m
10,Terrible Experience,"My family and I went to see the 1930's built former luxury liner ship the 'Queen Mary' in Long Beach, CA two days ago. We bought three quided tour tickets for $93.00, and went inside to the fourth floor of the elevator as instructed.We were immediately told there was a fire on the ship (we could smell the smoke), they were canceling the tour, and everyone must get off the ship immediately.We were told to go back to the ticket booth to get re-issue tickets to come back anytime in the next year, wait around for a few hours to see if we could come on board (really?) or to get a refund if that wasn't possible. I am from Minnesota, with just one afternoon to do this. 99.99% not likely to ever be back, so a refund is the logical choice.After our group and maybe 20 others existed, we never saw any other groups or employees exit the ship. So that seemed weird, but 100% for sure, we did smell smoke when we got off the elevator.Anyway, at the ticket booth, they refused to refund the tickets I bought just 10 minutes earlier. REFUSED. After myself and others in the same situation became annoyed, the ticket both women CALLED SECURITY on us all. Security was kind enough to escort all us pissed off customers away. The couple next to us said they were from Australia, leaving the next day, and also wanted a refund. Nope!After some time arguing back and forth, the best we got from them was a small business card and told to go to their web site to leave feedback on their 'Feedback' page with our receipt number.So sell me a ticket I can't use, then refuse to refund? Ummm, ya...If you are in southern California, I would suggest NOT going on a Queen Mary tour.By the way, the Queen Mary is actually owned by the City of Long Beach. Nice job City of Long Beach!Now I never got on the ship, so the only thing I can really say about that is walking up to it. I guess I was a little disappointed as to how faded and rusty it looked on the outside. Didn't look majestic at all... but maybe the inside that I never got to see was something else? I'll never know.",Joe M
30,It was okay,Not as much to see as I thought. But I'm glad we did it. Certain parts of the ship really take you back in time.,Jac F.
50,Great View and Fun Time,"Had dinner at Sir Winston's last Fri nice view and Excellent Food with a varied menu. Very nice and varied wine list and specialty drinks. We also walked around the decks, went on a special tour and watched the Winter Wonderland event. Easy parking.",Patti O
30,The queen,Stayed the night. For it being older surprise there were bathrooms. It was one of those rhing to say i did it,Genavieve R
40,Historical and fun,"I took my teenage daughter to the Queen Mary to show her what the old cruise ships looked like in their splendor back then, we were on a cruise to Alaska two years ago. While the walkthrough was interesting, she was entranced by the Haunted Tour and the guide did a good job telling about paranormal activity and ghost stories on board the Queen Mary. She now wants to go back and spend the night and also take the Haunted Tour again in the dark.",888arthury
40,Interesting and historical,"My husband and I, along with a couple of friends, recently spent time in southern California. While there, we decided to spend a day touring the Queen Mary in Long Beach. The parking was convenient and not insanely overpriced. We browsed around on a self-guided tour. One of the most interesting exhibits is the Princess Diana exhibit which also includes a lot of artifacts and information from several generations of royals prior to Diana and after. There are also a few of Diana's dresses on display. This exhibit costs extra on top of your admission ticket but we felt it was worthwhile. The Queen Mary is not nearly as ""grand"" as I had expected and seems to be in need of some upkeep, including painting her exterior. My husband and I spent the night in a stateroom with portholes that open and overlook the lights of the Long Beach skyline.",Maui2014NMR
40,"Much loved, tired Queen","While in transit between our Long Beach hotel and the Cruise Terminal we took a very brief opportunity to visit this Queen of the ocean.Clearly passed her best but none the less still beautiful we walked the decks, peeped in to a couple of the larger state rooms and created a few photo opportunities.We'd have loved a little more time to grab a bite to eat on board and explore a little.Although clearly in need of a little love we'll definately be back if we travel to California again to say hello to this wonderful, atmospheric peice of Brit maritime history.",Steve J
50,Queen Mary Haunted Tour,We decided to take a tour of the Queen Mary as the ship looks amazing from far and the reviews were great. We took our 2 teenage kids to the Haunted Tour and they enjoyed it just as much. So much history and our tour guide Dustin was great! This is a must do if you are in the area. We stayed much longer than we expected because we wanted to check out everything!,mariagsanchez1
30,Just ok,"A little disappointed, the ship is looking abit shabby.It passed a couple of hours but really expected more. Everything needed a lick of paint and a lot of areas were closed off.Lovely views from the top deck",Mrsanon
50,A beautiful passenger ship,"Definitely worth visiting - if you are bit more interested in history and ships, you can easily spend 3-4 hours on the ship walking across decks & cabins many times. Guided & unguided walks available. When on unguided tour, take the audio guide with you - not only it will provide you with directions how to get to different parts of the ship but it will also explain a lot about the history (once it used to be the biggest and fastest passenger ship). A really impressive experience. Temporary shows & exhibitions are also available. Downside - parking is quite expensive ($5/hour).",MaGPL
30,For history or ship enthusiasts,"The Queen Mary was a good visit for the few hours we were there. The tour was OK, but fairly boring. The ship itself is starting to show its age and the visit in total does not really justify the entrance fee. If possible, use a ""grouped"" attraction card like GoCard where this is included in the package if you really want to go.",Henry M
40,Attended a conference here,I was glad to stay on the ship and enjoyed walking around the ship interior and exterior. The historical aspects and beauty of the halls make up for the old plumbing and thin walls in the rooms.,Jeff S
50,What a beautiful ship,If you are ever in the area and you are looking for a day trip this is it.It is absolutely beautiful and there is so much to look at. I would suggest you get on a guided tour first then wander around on your own after.I spent the whole day here and i loved it. Don't miss out on looking at the engine room.,TrevB150
50,A must see in Long Beach!,This is such a great piece of history that tells so many stories! It is absolutely amazing and something that you have to see. We also went to dinner at Sir Winstons which is in board.,JohnG011
50,Fabulous 2-night stay aboard,We stayed for 2 nights on the Queen Mary. Very comfortable accommodations. Warm & cozy. Dinner both nights was as ordered and delicious. Great sightseeing on-board and off.,antikbuff1952
50,the queen,stayed on the Queen Mary about 5 times is a neat place . it has gotten a little worn down over the years.stayed there to take a cruise very convenient,Kathy F
50,For brunch and more,"We have had brunch here a couple of time and the selections are amazing. The Harpist playing in the background is a nice fancy touch - you feel very elegant, and the bottomless Mimosas are the best! We have also come here for the Halloween and Winter excitements and they are always fun, but I recommend buying line hopper passes because it does get crowded.",Leslie K
30,Ehhh,I went with a friend of mine to visit on the way to the airport. It was just not my thing and I was bored.,Lisa C
50,Spend the day,"We went during the harbor Halloween thing and it was madness getting out of the parking lot. I really wanted to spend the night in the hotel part of the ship but do to poor reviews for October with the Harbor Fright we decided against it. The guided tours on the ship were good. The audio tour was good but we got lost and could not find help. Oh course we had mobility issues which put a damper on our audio tour. Upstairs downstairs back upstairs, seemed like poor planning for a guided tour. Saw very few markers for where we were supposed to go. They did have an accessible audio tour but we could not get it on our earphone sets. We ran out of time before we did the whole tour.",carribbeanmic
40,UNBELIEVABLE HISTORICAL VALUE !,"We started out our visit with a trip to the theater , People's historical recollections, and testimonials will set the stage and tug at your heart strings.I loved the Diana legacy of a princess (gowns were stunning)One thing we are still trying to understand is why we couldn't purchase tickets for Dark Harbour in Canada?We had to head straight to Queen Mary to purchase tickets as soon as we landed (super inconvenient )You may purchase tickets for any other tours online though ?",Madison S
50,A must see!,Went to Sunday brunch on board the Queen Mary. It's pricey $59.00 but just the experience is worth it. There is every imaginable food so everyone will be happy -even chicken fingers for kids. The food was good not the best but good. Unlimited Champagne and Orange Juice. After brunch we tour the ship a great experience and worth the time. They have escorted or audio tours or you can walk around on your own. The history of the ship is amazing!,MB Q
50,Brunch with a twist!,Went here at Queen Mary for brunch and they do have champagne brunch and buffet. The price is a bit high but the food was good and it was unlimited champagne too. After our brunch we went around the Queen Mary and looked around this massive ship. I realized that you can get lost in this ship now I can only imagine if you're in a bigger ship. It was a pretty good brunch and also a nice stroll after eating a lot. I would recommend this to friends and families.,Alaindl
50,GREAT EXPERIANCE,"Staying on the Queen was truely a great experiance it is like living in the past,Everything has been kept like original. If you want a holliday inn this is not for you, The beds are great staff great the food was good very relaxing if you want something different this is it, I recomend it for the great experiance",kay b
50,Great to walk back in time with an amazing history,Several audible tours available to see the entire ship. Nice to see a great ship restored to its former glory.,devnprt1
50,Cool place to explore!,"We recently went to the Queen Mary to explore this magnificent historical museum! The history on this ship is really interesting. My husband and I want to come and spend a night next time we're in California, it looks like it could be fun! We ate at one of the restaurants and it was good food, the service was great too. The only negative i have to say about the ship, is that it needs a paint job on the outside, it's kind of sad to see the need for that for such a magnificent vessel. They are restoring different areas of the ship which makes me happy to see, it is a beauty!! Go visit!",Michelle J
40,Ghost Hunting Tour,"The tour guide was excellent and held the attention of some 20 boy scouts plus parents for an informative and fun tour. The ship is historic and full of interesting exhibits and artifacts.There is more to see than can be done reasonably in a day trip with several guided tours and self tours available.In additional there are seasonal attractions for Halloween , Christmas etc. that occur both inside and outside the ship.",1959Ian
50,Anniversary aboard the Queen Mary,Our stay on the Queen Mary was all I could hope for. History and romance abound. So much fun! The staff was very friendly and helpful. This was a stay that I will not soon forget.,Casie W
50,beautiful ship,I spent the day on the beautiful ship starting with the Princess Diana tour which was wonderful! Next was the historical tour which was great. We also did the haunted tour which was fun! The tour guides were knowledgeable and funny! We also had a business dinner on the ship which was fabulous! I highly recommend a visit to see the Queen Mary!,spurtee1978
50,California trip,Not sure what to say she's a grand ol lady lots of history tied to this great ship I'm just glad someone saved this piece of history I didn't know she served such major factor in the war . But I guess you can find all this out now thanks to the internet but seeing it is better the history tour tell about her past you can also book a room it serves as a hotel now .we just visited it .The tour did not show us any of the state rooms s they were all booked so that was kind of disappointing but still something to see,Sam612014

40,Haunted tour and free roaming on an 80 year old legend,"This is a separate review from my hotel stay and sir winstons dinner and is only for the historical museum and tourist attraction aspect of the ship.The ship initially looks beautiful but close up you can see the years have not been kind with rust streaked, faded, peeling paint that seems to get worse towards the stern and this is the reason for 4/5.On board things are better and the ship carries a patina that only 80 years of service can give signifying that this is genuine history not just Disney-fied recreation - e.g. The original light fixtures, murals and frescos dotted around amongst the shops and corridors. The cabin re-creations and model ships gallery are amazing in their detail and the engine rooms and the propellor are a must see as are the bridge and observation bar - a must for a drink or two. The haunted tour was interesting with plenty of history and my wife even photographed the ghost of a woman in a swimming cap in the first class pool area. The warm cinnamon buns from the midships Starbucks were lovely.The staff, especially Robert our guide for the haunted tour, were all really friendly and helpful.Overall a must see if your in Long Beach as judging by her external condition and the oily water sloshing round the bottom of the engine room this grand octagenerian lady's time may be limited.",G_O_C479
50,She's a beautiful living monument,"We went for a tour, and focused on the new Princess Diana exhibit, as well as the Art of Winston Churchill exhibit. Both were beautiful exhibits, carefully orchestrated and very well documented. Don't miss this if you're in the Long Beach area.",RickThePick
40,Only good if you stay in the hotel.,"I live in the area and have been going to the Queen Mary for a long time. Recently they implemented a policy that charges you to get on the boat even if your going to a restaurant on the boat which is totally crazy. Save your money and go to the reef or Maya to eat until the queen Mary can come up with something reasonable. The tours and shops are great, but it's not good enough for a extra tax to step aboard.",Andre' T
40,Incredible!!🛳🛳,Our Tour Guide was excellent and very informative. The view from the sky deck was amazing and the inside of the ship is spectacular. I would highly recommend this attraction if you're into boats and like learning about history.,Jay D
40,Fantastic History,"I often walk (or run) by this amazing ship. It has to be the star of Long Beach. Do take a moment to at least walk past, but an on board visit will demonstrate a bygone life. The food on board is great!",Ian A
50,Stunning Look Back in Time!,"Just yesterday, a group of 34 of us, from my son's High School, journeyed a 4 hour drive to the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. My son's Theatre Co. will be performing, ""Titanic the Musical"" in December. We wanted the kids to get a real feel of a ship of this size and understand the excitement and tragedy of the cross Atlantic travels of the day.We had two tours scheduled for the day. First being a tour & general history of the Queen Mary. Our tour guide was Dustin and he did not disappoint! He was very knowledgable and dressed the part in Captains uniform and a handle bar mustache!Our 2nd tour was a 'haunted' tour (being so near Halloween, but this tour is available always). It was so cool! Our guide took ALL of us, 4 stories beneath the boat into dark & dusty corners...into the old, forgotten pool area, the creepy, creepy engine rooms and beyond. The kids LOVED it and got many photos and videos of questionable images?! The self guided tour with the head set, I would bypass, as it was confusing and hard to use. Better to just walk around, take in the smells & sites & read the placards and imagine your cross Atlantic voyage! Wear comfy shoes, it a LONG boat to walk steam to stern and many, many steps! Sleeping rooms aboard the ship as well as many eating establishments.",Krebsy724
30,Enjoyable but sad,"Visited the Queen Mary at Long Beach port yesterday. It's an impressive looking ship as you pull into the parking lot. It's a hotel and event venue plus they do tours for the public. You can have a drink, meal or coffee while you are there. Entry starts at $29.00 plus tax.As you approach the ship you hit by the neglected appearance, flaking paint and rust from years of neglect, a shame as it has to be a money spinner and they should reinvest.The tour was good and informative and it's done in small groups so you can ask questions and our guide was great. The condition inside the ship is not great either.Maybe I'm too fussy but I expected to see it in its former glory.Still worth a visit and I'm glad I went, just I expected old world charm and it wasn't there.",motorcar1
40,A Grand Old Gal,"As a South Bay native, I've always wanted to stay on board and was thrilled for my husband and I to be able to celebrate our anniversary here this weekend.The Queen retains a great deal of her sumptuous luxury, with the addition many modern amenities. Turning 80 this year (May 2016), small indications of her well lived life can be seen but rarely impair the experience.The staff have been delightful, helpful, and committed to furthering not only guests' experience, but also the best maintenance of this Queen of the Seas.",Tim R
40,Ageing beauty in need of a paint job.,"We arrived by cruise ship and docked right beside the Queen Mary, however, possibly as they were setting up for a big Halloween celebration, it was tough to find our way to the ship. She looks like she needs a paint job on the outside, but the inside is all teak decking and 32 different wood veneers. This makes for a dark, rich, days gone by feeling. We took a guided tour which was very informative regarding the previous lives of the ship from its launch, through WWII, to it's current life as a tour destination and hotel. The tour did take us down below decks to some of the stateroom corridors, now hotel, however, we did not get to see any of the suites or staterooms as they would have been originally fitted out, which is a shame. Lots of photographs of celebrities and movie stars around the ship. You can wander around on your own or take a headset tour - not sure what you get to see doing it that way. All in all a good attraction giving a look back at the golden days of passenger liners.",Onx23mm
30,Paranormal Activity Tour,"My sister and I bought ($80) tickets to take the Paranormal Activity Tour at the Queen Mary. We were so excited, our tour guide seemed very serious about the tour and whom we might encounter. We were all given some kind of device to detect spirits, we were also encourage to use our smart phone's recorder to capture any sounds our naked ears may have missed. The tour started at 11pm and went on till almost 3am. It was interesting but nothing I would recommend anyone to go out and spend $80 on. Needless to say our group did not capture any paranormal activity, we were disappointed. Save your money and go to dinner instead.",Love to Travel S
50,Luxury ocean liner!,"We enjoyed the Queen Mary very much. Definitely, this was the way to travel back then. We also did the Princess Diana exhibit. Plan to spend 6 to 7 hours, and wear comfortable shoes, as there are a few decks to visit and lots of stairs/steps to go form one deck to the next.",Victor H
50,Spectacular - worth a drive to Long Beach,"I would not recommend Long Beach for a holiday stay...however, I can highly recommend this attraction. The ship is awesome and there is a lot to see - everything is so ""intact"" and really reminds you of the golden era of ships.Unfortunately there is also a Starbucks in there, but well...there is a decent restaurant you can visit, too, and there is of course the hotel...Additionally, there is a princess Diana exhibition with all possible stuff about her and about the royal English family starting with queen Mary and ending with princess Kate...Book the guided tour and the Diana exhibition as you will get to see rooms otherwise not open to the public.Definitely worth a drive if you are on holidays in L.A. or San Diego...",Silvita
40,A Humbling Walk Through History,"We arrived around 9:30 A.M. So we went right in. We did the self guided tour and then the Historical Tour. Both very good. We had lunch in the Chelsea Chowder House. Food was good, the service---you get your table, your food and your check, don't complicate things like needing a water refill. The best part for us-the WWII history of the Queen Mary. Wow! What a gal!! Today She's 80...sitting silently in salt water...go see her before more time and erosion make an end of this Gritty, Glorious, Grand Lady!!",feltoneer
50,Beautiful and full of history,We enjoyed our tour of the Queen Mary. So amazing to see original construction. Love that you can stay on board to really experience the ship. Next time I would like to book there.,JLCCC1970
50,What a beautiful reminder,"We went here with friends and wandered the ship. She's beautiful and the historical info is well provided, non-obtrusive, a reminder of a harsher and yet more genteel time. We ate at the Chowder House which was delicious and had a gorgeous view. Great service, a little pricey as one would expect for a tourist attraction. All-in-all one of our favorite things we did in LA.",urgayle
50,Historically valueable,"The Queen Mary may look weathered on the outside, but the inside is gorgeous! Check in was easy and quick considering all the people waiting. Staff was friendly and helpful. The room was great, very clean. We had a king bed, it was comfortable and had plenty of pillows. Bathroom was small and tub narrow. Water pressure wasn't strong, but did the job just fine. Walls weren't as thin as I was expecting, so we only heard the people across the hall when the door was slammed. Outside noise was to be expected since we had the portholes open. The decor of the boat was beautiful. Wood and brass and smelled old, but not unpleasant (reminded me of one of my elderly relatives' homes). We didn't take any of the tours, just walked around and looked at everything ourselves. The history of being a cruise liner and then troop transport was interesting. Lots of original artwork and other items displayed. We ate dinner at the Chelsea Chowder House, the service and the food were very good. Had a nice view across the harbor to Long Beach. Drinks in the art deco lounge were good and not badly priced. Spent most of the evening out on the deck since the weather was really nice, and the dj inside had music going and people were dancing. Would definitely go back.",Lori S
30,With a visit if you have time to spare,"We purchased a First Class Passport. James who did The Glory Days tour was entertaining but the Haunted Encounters tour felt oversubscribed and was cramped for the dark, narrow spaces that we were taken to. It felt like we were just taken a back stage tour of the ship into storage areas. Even the ""haunted bedroom"" was effectively just as stripped back suite. My favourite part of the tour was the recollections of those who'd sailed on her and the stories of folks who she really meant something to as well as the stages of the different bedrooms, salon and dining areas. The 4D screening was excellent. The parts of the ship we saw showed how grand it would've been in its Glory Days. Quite nostalgic since I live not far from where she was built.",lainneyaq
50,Great day trip,"We enjoyed our time spent on the Queen Mary - we spent most of the day aboard exploring the whole ship. We thoroughly enjoyed the Historic tour with Danny. It does seem expensive, the admission fee parking, the cafés and especially the souvenir photographs. If you can get a good deal on a room here, which includes admission and parking, it may be worth visiting thia way. Overall, well worth a trip if you are in the area.",Matt B
50,This is a must,We bought a double tour passport and it was quite expensive but a good way to get a look around and be informed about the history and facilities on board. Some friend went for an 18 dollar breakfast and no tours and they also had a look around but without all the detail we got. The Winston Churchill special painting exhibition was also good and was available to all guests,grannye
50,Nostalgic,Its been many years since I was on board but I still treasure that memory dearly. we did eat at one of the restaurants and that was equally nostalgic. I still love dropping by the area just to see the majestic lady,John Goldsmith
10,What a shame,"We were very disappointed, the Queen Mary is a beautiful ship that has been neglected, we wish we had not bothered. The cost to visit was high and the condition of the ship is very poor, peeling paint, rotten floor boards, threadbare carpets, it is very sad this beautiful ship has been let go. The 4d theatre was bizarre why they even bother I'm not sure.",PhilG_11
40,A Legacy of History,We went with our toddler. We dined in their restaurant which was relatively okay. Service just needed improvement as my husband felt we were shortchanged by the food attendant. Food was okay. We also dined at their bar and for me it was a better and more enjoyable experience than the restaurant. The ambience was better and the food quite good. Service was also good and prompt. We did not go with the scheduled tours. It did look inviting and very informative so maybe we will come back for it since we obtained an annual pass. It was an amazing experience to be in something that was part of history.,Joanne R
20,Very expensive,"Right from the start I felt I was getting ripped off. The ticket booth implies you have to buy a guided tour as part of your entry. You don't. Use the free audio tour.The ship is very well presented and is interesting to look around. Where you can.It is also a hotel, conference centre and wedding venue, so lots of it are marked ""private"" etc. The audio tour is free and is interesting, telling you lots and pointing out interesting aspects of the ship and it's history.We bought the history tour. What a rip off. We learnt more form the audio tour than this and the guide was so over the top in his mannerisms and voice i suspected at one point he was actually on drugs.There is food and shopping available at the normal inflated pricing when they know they have you cornered. For the two of us, the tour and entry fee and parking came to over a hundred dollars. It's not worth it, get a book and read about it or just google the history of it.",Phil da Greek
40,Family Tour,"The kids, myself and my husband loved the haunted tour almost as much as the self guided one. We were there about 2 hours and had a blast taking ton's of pictures and learning so much about the ship and it's journeys. The only disappointment was that my daughter wanted to see the Diana exhibit but it is not included with the pass we purchased. We did not realize that at the time.",Cass S
50,An amazing stay and tour,"What would our last nights in LA be without visiting and staying on the Queen Mary. We weren't disappointed, what an amazing piece of history this is. You can feel the past as you walk her hallways and decks. Even better, we managed to get on the evening ghost tour. Even without the ghost stories, the history told was fascinating and our guide was just great. An enjoyable way of exploring the ship. Our stay was comfortable, although walls are thin (not the fault of the venue but how it was built). Everything was clean with good access to a bar and eating places onboard. Great way of spending a night.",MossCharm
40,Worth doing,We did the historic and haunted tours and both were great. It was quiet on a Monday and so there was lots of space to wander freely. Haunted tour was particularly fun but Dustin who did the historic tour was one of the best guides I've seen. Fun and knowledgable.,Paulrob75
40,A beautiful piece of history. Always love the stories.,We did a self tour and the Princess Dianna exhibit. Both were very interesting. Enjoyed lunch at the Chowder room restaurant.,Betsviews
40,Historical Importance,Old WW-II War Ship. Has Historical Importance. Ghost show was OK but you do get to know/ see some parts of the ship which you would not seen otherwise. All areas are NOT easily accessible with mobility issues visitors. Not worth staying for the night.,sorabh
50,Even if you just visit - do so.,If you don't have time to stay on board for a memorable night the ship is still well worth a visit.There are various tours you can take and all the history and nostalgia is great. The ship is still beautiful even if stationary.,TonyD33
50,A Great Piece of History,"Danny was our guide as we explored the ship. Cunard Line built the ship in 1936 in Scotland. In 1940 it was used as a war ship to transport troops. It was the fastest moving ships, so that even though the German submarines came after it, it always was able to get away. Air travel ended the ship's voyage. In 1967 it was sold to the city of Long Beach for $3,450,000. It took 4 years to turn it into a hotel (1971). It still has the original teak decks and is filled with art deco decoration.",Gloria F
50,Fun!,A cute little tourist attraction. Not far from the Aquarium of the Pacific so you could do both on the same day! Super fun for the kids and adults.,Elzajohanson
50,An interesting and great day...,"Loved this attraction!We spent the day on the ship (it's not a boat!) and done the self guided audio tour. At first I didn't think this was for me, yet really enjoyed the history and facts from the guided tour. You can do this at your own leisure which was great as wasn't rushed to see things and take it all in. We also attended the history tour which was approximately an hour tour with a rep who went into detail on the history, yet some of it was repeated from the audio.The Tea Room was closed so had lunch from Starbucks which was overpriced in my opinion, not sure if able to take your own food on, I am guessing so?The only regret was not staying on in one of the hotel rooms, I think this would have been a lovely experience.Overall, a good day out. It's just a shame it's not in England!",ELC2009
50,Definitely worth a visit,"Stay the night, take a tour, or just go and see her. She sits in Long Beach harbour, her sailing done after 131 transatlantic crossings.Great photographs at night too, as they light her up! Definitely worth your time to visit.",Stephen WA
40,Historic Cruising,"We visited on a day a Princess cruise ship was in town. The people we were with said you used to be able to just walk on and look around, but we were required to buy tickets for a tour. The tour was nice, but it would have been better to be able to just walk around on our own. (We could do that after but we were running out of time). I would still recommend it to see how cruising used to be.",MGums
40,Lots of History.,We really enjoyed our tour. Learned a lot about the ship I didn't know. My dad sailed on this ship during WW2. While it was a war ship. The only good part about the ghost was that you got to see parts of the ship you wouldn't see on the regular tour. The story's they told you were down right silly. This is why I score it a 4 instead a 5.,Donald B
40,Haunted tour,"It was interesting because it's a piece of history, and we learned a lot about how it was built, where it was built, and how it got to Long Beach. It's old and musty and I'm kind of glad we didn't stay there but it was a cool way to spend a few hours.",dlarocqu
50,Loved our visit to the Queen Mary and the Princess Diana Exhibit!,"We drove from N. CA specifically to see the Princess Diana Exhibit. Anyone w/any interest in Princess Diana and the Royal Family is sure to enjoy this exhibit. Much more to see than just her gowns and dresses. After viewing the exhibit on our own, we toured the ship on our own. It was fascinating to see how cruise travel was so many years ago. Everything was quite ""deluxe"" for first class passengers. We stopped into the forward bar for a drink and admired the beautiful original paintings and woodwork. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and helpful. There is a free tourist bus stop across the parking lot but we walked there very easily from the Maya Hotel and enjoyed the beautiful harbor views .FYI, we booked everything on line before we left home which made boarding and entry to the exhibit very smooth and efficient.",MontereyGirl47
10,Awful!,"The most tatty, miserable, awful place in we have ever stayed. And I am reviewing this as an hotel not an attraction.I appreciate many may have enjoyed their stay, but our experience was very, very disappointing. Cabin was cold with old air blowing from ceiling vent. When we called down to ask for this to be attended to we were told ""the engineer is on his lunch"" (only one?). After two hours he came up and said he would go away and fix it, however he only managed to turn it off. Beds hard with NO facilities in the room. We even had to request towels.Stained bath and basin with corrosion. Walls so thin ALL noise and conversation in next cabin could be heard. Where do I stop? Thank goodness we were only there for one night. Couldn't wait to leave and move on. Surprisingly (tongue in cheek) of the six other hotels we stayed in along the coast, this is the only one which hasn't sought our opinion on our stay.I could go on, but I think I have made my opinion clear. One final point though, even our drive up to the entrance was a let-down. Huge posters hung around the area of the ship's entrance advertising tours of the ship and other "" special"" attractions.Never, never again.",Brian H
30,Rustic with History,Feel free to walk around without anyone asking you if you need help ! Best part was the Starbucks ! We chose not to rent a room in the hotel I'm glad we chose not to we were never asked if we needed help or hello good morning nothing !,contreras1965
40,"History, leisure, and entertainment!","At least take a tour, but stay a night, if you can. My niece got married on the ship, so our family chose to stay a couple nights aboard. The wedding chapel and reception room were quaint and the atmosphere was magical. My niece had a vintage style theme (her dress, decor, etc), so it really felt like we time traveled. We had a two double bed room with two portholes that we had open most of the time (the weather was beautiful, there were no bugs, and we had the sound of barking seals wake us each day). We took the 8:00pm 'ghost tour'. We were a bit hesitant, because we're not a zombie-loving-please-scare-me type of family, but we enjoyed the tour immensely. Our guide included historical information and shared stories about parts of the ship that have had reports of 'ghosts' or strange occurrences. One part of the tour had props for the upcoming Halloween events, so I had my 10 year old daughter close her eyes for this brief part (it was stuff like dolls with 'blood' on them, handprints on the wall, etc... Not too gruesome, but enough to give a 10 year old bad dreams). The Passport shuttle has a pickup spot in the parking lot, so you have free access to all of Long Beach. While on the ship, we also visited the Harbor (whale watching cruise, aquarium, restaurants), went to the beach, and made a trip to the grocery store-all via the shuttle. We did not have a fridge or coffee maker in our room (probably why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5). Another guest told me you could ask for a fridge, but it was not mentioned by staff. The staff at the front desk, tour, gift shop, and especially the bellmen were very friendly and helpful.",juliathegr82
50,Grand Old Dame,"Loved staying on the big boat. Such a historical museum. Informative and entertaining exhibits all over the ship. Some free, some with admission fees. Do as much or as little as you can afford. We loved the true Art Deco theme throughout the ship. Our room had portholes that opened to views of Long Beach. The evening tour guide was great. The price was great, we'll be back.",jlwitaly
50,"80 Years of History! A ""Must Visit"".","We are from Central Florida and have cruised all over the world on the modern cruise ships. While on a trip to Hollywood, we made a special trip to Long Beach to visit the Queen Mary in her permanent berth in Long Beach. I am so glad we did!The ship showed the technology and design of the 1930s and immediately upon entering, we felt like we had gone back in time! The Promenade Deck was vintage 1930s with dark woods and brass showcasing the interior areas. The Sun Deck, still decked with the original teak decking, showed the unbelievable length of the ship when viewed from either the bow or the stern. An anti-aircraft gun still was in place on the bow, making her time as ""The Grey Ghost"", a WWII troop carrier, a reality. The bridge glistened with the original helm hardware. The radio room and ship's switchboard were an indicator of the technological advances that have occurred. Even the hull construction was immediately noticeable with the millions of rivets holding the plates together!Once in the ship, many tours are available or you can just walk the decks and enjoy. We took the audio tour, which lasted about 3 hours, but took us through the ship and provided historical reference as well as significance of the parts and pieces of the ship.It is obvious in many areas that time is taking its toll on the old ship, but the City is doing a very good job keeping it presentable. We thoroughly enjoyed our time on the ship and recommend this historical attraction for anyone who appreciates history or marine activities!",Steve O
50,Great place to visit,"A really good place to visit if in the Long Beach area, when we visited there was lots of construction on the roads so the sat nav was useless.Its an old ship and this is reflected in the exterior but then how many of us will look that good at 82 !The engine room and propellor are well worth spending some time looking at. There are also great views of the harbour .",alex965
50,Interesting,very interesting Great food had a lot of history and great visibility of area Would stay when i make my next visit,Vin R
30,OK Attraction,"The audio tour was very confusing, so i just returned the headset. I then did the history tour for a short time as it only appeared to entail walking along different models of the ship and other ships while listening to history facts. I then went on my own and walked around the ship to see what I wanted at my pace. Not overly impressed but glad I got the chance to see and check out the ship.",RonVermont
10,Terrible service,All I can say is don't expect to take the Ghost Tour at dark as it is only offered until 5 or 6. I advise to make sure there are no weddings while you stay there,moredrama
40,Hail to the queen,We stopped here on our way from LAX to see the queen. She is a grand old lady that could use a bit of sprucing up at least on the outside. The lines were way too long to take the tour so we just walked around. They do charge for parking which was a bit surprising. Worth the stop if you have never visited and are in the area.,rrw1759
50,Queen of Long Beach,Fantastic Sunday brunch followed by a guided tour of this majestic ship. Well worth the time whilst in Long Beach.,Norman E
40,Surprisingly interesting!,"I had various reports on the Queen Mary tours. Went anyway and both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. Not normally into this type of attraction however this could satisfy many people with different interests.The regular 'history' tour covers aspects from the luxury, times during the war, and a good walk through the engine areas.Food available which easily helps fill in half a day.",Peter B
50,"A Tribute to a Beautiful Princess, Diana","The guided tour of the Queen Mary was extremely interesting, then we visited the Princess Diana tribute exhibition which had many of her famous dresses, gowns and outfits on display, she was such a wonderful lady. We then did the self guided tour over the rest of the rest of the ship, the guide map was good and the information was available at the points of interest.",bollen57
50,Historical and fascinating ship,We had a wonderful tour of the Queen Mary. We opted for the guided Haunted Tour. Our guide was exceptional down to his handle bar mustache. He took us to several behind the scenes places including the place of impact and the pool. His stories and animation made this one of the best tours ever. Highly recommend visiting the Queen Mary.,Laurie B
40,Totally unique,"Well, if you're looking to stay somewhere in Long Beach for a couple of nights, look no further.We stayed two nights - probably enough, one night not enough really.In forty years of staying in hotels all round the world, I doubt we've ever stayed anywhere with so much to see and so much to talk about.Our deluxe cabin with king size bed and view over the city was a real surprise in terms of size - plenty of space, lots of room to accommodate all our luggage, slept with portholes open for fresh air so we didn't need the air con. Good bed and bedding.We ate at Sir Winston's. A fab venue, food not quite as wonderful as we anticipated but 10/10 for setting and 7/10 for food.We did the historical tour with Chris as docent, he was excellent. Exploring the ship alone was fun, especially the engine rooms.Why didn't I award five stars?The bathroom.It seriously needs a steam clean, around taps, overflow, tiled edges, back of door. Really not clean enough. I know this is old sanitary ware but I could get it looking better with an old toothbrush and some bleach, so come on housekeeping, try harder.But don't let that put you off this unique experience.",Chinahattie
30,Overpriced,"All of the tours for the Queen Mary, as a non hotel guest, includes an audio tour, which can take about an hour or more, at least 1 guided tour (prices vary, approx 1 hour each), and a 4D short movie (which has nothing to do with the ship)The cheapest tickets on the website is $27 each, they are $29 at the gate and then they add a $2 no reason charge so for 2 people it cost us $62.There is no where to park and walk so you're forced to use their parking. The parking is $18 or $8 if you have a meal there and get the parking validated. You only get the cheaper rate if you are there for 3 hours or LESS! And thats from when you enter not when you get it validated from...So because we went, had to wait 45 minutes for our tour, were apparently not allowed to start the audio tour till after that, had lunch (approx $50) and wine tasting ($16 flight of red) we were parked there for about 4 hours and they tried to charge us $18. I kept arguing with them and they ended up charging us only $5. Go me! Damn thieves.The ship itself is beautiful and has a fantastic history, the Lego ship is cool and there's also model cross sections of ships which was an interesting display as well. We had Kelly as our tour guide and she was very entertaining and knowledgeable. Some of the other staff on board, like the lady at the tour check in desk or the events coordinator were crabby cranky beings.Lunch at the bar was nice, little pricy for what is was but good. The wine tastings at Malibu wines were good, generous pours and a nice guy serving.",R0wi3
20,Expensive for the quality,"We thought we would have lunch on board, parking is $18 before any restaurant discount and you must purchase a tour to board the ship, $25-$35/person, if you are not staying in the hotel. While our tour guide did a very good job, the tour itself was limited to several decks and the ball room. No staterooms, other activity rooms, mechanical rooms, officers quarters, etc. The exterior of the ship is in need of some TLC as it looks very tired. The areas that we did visit were clean. We did have a nice lunch overlooking Long Beach and drinks at the Observation Bar, but add that to the price of admission and it became pricey",JOHN W
30,"Poorly maintained, submarine and ship","3 stars is generous and only for a true history buff that can look past the poor maintenance. There's actually two floating museums here: an old Soviet Foxtrot sub, and the Queen Mary. They're both HORRIBLY maintained. If you want to see either one, you might want to come quickly before they get closed due to safety violations. The rust is eating through many weight bearing structures and paint is just slapped on top as if that's going to solve the problem. It won't. Paying to see these relics is literally highway robbery because you've already invested so much just to drive this far, wait in a long line to get into parking, pay for parking, and then navigate poorly maintained and unpoliced lots to get to the ship. Ripoff. And highway robbery. If you're a BIG nautical history buff, then you'll find this to be highly average. If you're a true mariner, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're just coming for dinner, you might be upset.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
40,A Fun Option for Brunch or Cocktails,"I've been to the Queen Mary on a few occasions. The parking is a bit steep, but if you snag a bite on board, they'll pro-rate it.Once you board the ship, its like stepping back into the 1920's-40's.Just poking around the ship for a few hours is a lot of fun. There are several exhibits including rooms that have been kept true to period, and models of other passenger ships (Titanic/Normandie/etc)Cocktails on board were a good pour, this is obviously not a dive bar.The brunch was huge, and the champagne flowed generously.",Snellerelli
20,Poor and fairly expensive,"The ship is not in best of condition, I appreciate it costs a reasonable amount maintain the vessel, however, we purchased our tickets and then told the tour would take place over an hour away from when we arrived.We walked a couple of decks and then left. Disappointing having travelled a good distance to visit it.",Keith P
40,Step back in time,"I've been visiting the Queen Mary as a native of Long Beach since I was a little kid when I first saw the ""Poseidon Adventure"",!which was filmed on here in 1972.This is a beautiful 1930s Art Deco palace. It's not every day you get to roam on board a beautiful vintage, still floating, oceanliner built by the same company that owned and built the Titanic.There's a wonderful self guided tour and a guided tour and it is just a wonderful step back in time overall. Sunday morning they have a very good Sunday brunch. It's a little gypricey, but you at least get to be on board the ship and walk around and dine in the first class dining room, so that kind of makes up for the high price ($60)I've even spent the night and used electronic monitor and caught some EVP voices.As far as spending the night in the hotel, I would wait because they are renovating. I've done it twice already and I was very disappointed. They nickel and dime you, and they could've spent more attention to detail in the rooms, but maybe that's why they are renovating, because one of my reviews on Yelp reviews. In any event, I would wait come back in a year if you're wanting to spend the night.But there's a nice souvenir shop, and the ""observation bar"" is absolutely beautiful.The Queen Mary iis a good time ""if you like living in the past"" like I do.",Jonah O
40,"Time warp, with a dose of the paranormal",Fun to visit - the ship has many areas where historic architecture is preserved. Educational stuff appears in various places if you stroll around. There are also set tours. If you are into ghosts you will love this place - you can just feel the vibe as soon as you step on board. Be sure to have a drink at the lounge - great old world charm.,Katherine F
50,Holiday and Birthday treat,Being ex navy was interested in seeing this ship. The tours are worth going on and you can get a good sense of how people used to travel.I do wish they would put a lick of paint on the outside but apart from that no issues. The staff are friendly and helpful although they did confuse an old navy chap by not using port and starboard😊. Had 2 lovely days staying on the ship and definitely worth a visit.,Jag Man
50,Where did the Goose Go?,"I went to Long Beach as a kid seeing the Queen Mary for the first time, but at the time it was just an old boat to me, and my main piece of enjoyment was to see the Spruce Goose. It is a shame that it is no longer there, but as an adult, the boat holds more appeal, and is a wonderful tour if you enjoy that type of thing as I do.",WineDineandPlay
30,It was ok,"I think the room was a little overpriced. The place needs some refreshing done. There was a tile off the shower trim at the floor level, and just sitting there (you could at least glue it on). Also the inside of the shower seriously needed grout replacement. The bed was comfortable. It would help if you could figure out some kind of night light in the bathroom area on the inside stateroom ~ the overhead light was too much & nothing was too dark. It was a bare bones room. They had shampoo & conditioner, but no soap. Thank goodness the A/C did work. It did have a blow dryer, but seriously you need to install a lighted make-up mirror. No coffee pot, microwave or refrigerator. There is nothing really around where the ship is located, but there is a free bus (which runs frequently) to take you downtown or across the bridge to restaurants & shopping center.",Retiredlady46
40,Got Lost!,"We had a good time exploring the Queen Mary, but I wish we had skipped the headset tour and just wandered around on our own or had an actual human tour guide. Trying to follow the ""guide"" in the headset was difficult at best and the way didn't seem well marked. But when we just gave up and wandered on our own we found some pretty cool stuff. Be prepared for a lot of stairs...especially if you get lost!",Debi M
40,Vacationlady,"Only lost 1 star because of the parking and that is true of many places I long beach. We had 3 hours to visit (including lunch) because that was the only way to clear the parking charge. The visit was very nice for the time we had. Very historical, loved the films they ran about the folks who had historical accounts, very moving. Tours were expensive though I'm sure educational.",Eric A
30,Awful 2 star rooms!!,"Arrived on Friday to be near the port for our 7 day cruise. 1st room we checked into reeked of cigarettes, was run down and seriously needed a make over. We requested another room. When we walked into the 2nd room it had not been cleaned and was a wreck!! Not a good visual! The 3rd room was not much better, but, at that point it was clear none of the rooms were going to be any better. For $350 a new night I was extremely disappointed. The welcoming staff was unfriendly and seemed put out because we were unhappy with dirty smelly rooms. On a good note, the porters were great and the self guided tour of the engine was also nice. Overall, the Queen Mary needs a serious over haul!! Definitely will not stay there again for $350 a night!!",Sunshine191565
50,Sharing a piece of history with my middle school daughter,"An awesome experience. You can ask for an original room when booking and you truly feel like you are back in time at the height of old world luxury. I definitely recommend a night or two on board the Queen Mary with your children, or perhaps for a romantic getaway. A delightful gem.",Ironqween
50,Don't Miss it,Much to see on this restored cruise ship of yesteryear. Plan to spend most of a day. Wear comfortable shoes as there is lots of walking. The history tour was very interesting providing a glimpse into life aboard the ship both as a cruise passenger and during WW 2 when it was used to transport soldiers. The ghosttour was also interesting but we were disappointed that it didn't have any of the promised special effects. Lunch on the ship was very good . There is a self guided audio tour plenty of exhibits and shops. We spent about 5 hours and still didn't see many of the exhibits,iove2travel55
40,Living museum,"The QM is old and management is slack. Business must be hard to upkeep such a big ship. Yet it is the real thing, authentic and they have kept the atmosphere as much as possible. Ivernight parking is US$20 which is quite expensive. Not much to do nearby, have to drive to go to shops.",Trevorruth
40,Nice model ships with great detail on display in the museum.,"The Queen Mary had an area that has wonderful replicas of some beautiful ships. Some of these took more than 6 years to build and thousands of hours. The details are magnificent.If anything, I would recommend going and seeing it.The quick synopsis of that ship displayed is historically accurate and can teach a person a lot about the era of that ship which it surrounded and its history.I have seen many replicas of a variety of different things. I am always amazed when the detail AND the scaling is accurate.Very nicely done.If you have children that like Legos then come and look at the Queen Mary build by Legos. There are a few tables for the kids to play on and build their own Lego image as well.I gave it a 4 star because some areas like the decks and outside parts of this beautiful ship should be kept in better shape and should be restored better. You can tell the new coats of paint were just slapped on without proper sanding or prep work. For a ship that ran decades on the water and had this history behind it should deserve a little extra care and love. Being a tourist attraction and charges a healthy price for admission and has a lot of tourists, some of that money should be spent on better restorations and better workmanship.The buffet area has peeling paint on the ceiling with obvious dark patches that appear to be from a leak and now a mold build up. That should be restored as well.This once beautiful ship carried some amazing stars and hosted top parties. Clearly in its day a lot of care went into it and no expense was spared. The wood carvings and detail of the old elevators in its prime day must have been a show stopper. They should be resorted better.I think it is worth a visit for sure and I would go back.",BeataBallo
50,Homage to the Queen,"The Queen Mary is a beautiful ship steeped in history, and in an equally beautiful setting across from the Long Beach shoreline. If you choose to take a guided tour, you will learn about its service to the WW2 troops, and the luxury cruises after. Also, there are stories of ""ghost"" sightings onboard. The Queen is indeed beautiful. Don't miss it if you are coming to Long Beach.",Sonna E
50,Queen Mary,This history of this ship is impressive. I have went a couple of times and learn something new each time.,Nisla M
50,A Beautiful Reminder Of When Travel Was Luxurious,"I stayed on the Queen Mary for 4 nights to do a video shoot on the ship. We had upscale quarters that felt like we had stepped back in time into the heyday of transatlantic travel. The boat is in pristine shape and touring it is a pleasure. The ornate detail of the floors, walls, paintings and murals remind you of how the other half lived. It is grand and beautiful. There is also a great dinner murder mystery show that is very entertaining. I spent hours just walking the ship and enjoying the common areas. On a side note, Long Beach is a little ways from Hollywood but we still went and watched them film a TV show. The Queen Mary was a great experience.",ljackson97
40,Love the history,"We booked a night on the Queen Mary because of the historic nature of the ship. The room we had a an inside and for the cost was quite reasonable..but you must do your homework to get the best price.Once on the ship, you are free to tour the ship and look at the many famous people who have stayed on the ship, including my favorites, the Three Stooges.You can also sign up for tours of the ship such as the ghost tours, you can also have a drink in the bar of dinner in one of the restaurants but be prepared to pay for the pleasure.We brought on beer and walked around the ship with it. We also had our own dinner we brought on board.One thing is there isn't a lot of public parking so once you park your car, if you can find a spot, you are there for the night as they don't have in and out privileges. Guess they want you to park in the valet.",Brian D
50,So much history - loved it!,Few days in Long Beach and number one to do was the Queen Mary.Let's get the cons out of the way - I ordered tickets on line thinking we would avoid the lines - wrong. Was sent back from entrance to wait 15 minutes in line at the ticket booth to take my printed out ticket for another ticket.The price to park was not advertised on the site and it is a whopping $18. Eat at a restaurant and you can get a discount. Seems steep and wasn't happy about that additional expense. The surrounding area of the QM is not the best - needs a clean up.So onto the ship! East to follow signs and great audio tour that was included in our ticket. We decided on the history tour and the amazing JAMES did not disappoint! He was entertaining and best part of the tour - a strong voice! With 20+ people no one should have complained about not hearing him - strong and loud. He made us smile and have an excellent fact filled tour.We did the rest of our audio tour after our tour with James. Had a drink in the bar near the front of the ship.History at it's best! Happened to be the Art Deco weekend so interesting vendors and many visitors dressed up in period costume. Added to the while ambience of the ship.The Queen Mary is truly one of a kind and full of stories and adventures - loved being back in another era for 4 hours!,tber
50,Fancy ship,We took a tour of the ship. Our guide was quite out there and very animated. Making it an interesting experience to remember. All in all a fun time worth visiting. The woodwork and art everywhere through out the ship was beautiful.,Jonathon b
30,Average,"Nice and not bad. We enjoyed the stay and the staff was friendly, the food good and the view pleasant",dratihelps
50,Iconic ship,An excellent historic experience to board the Queen Mary - full of interesting information and good quality shops - highly recommended.,GRAHAMMMCFARLANE
30,History,If you are really bored go visit the Queen Mary. Docked across the bay from downtown Long Beach it is isolated from the rest of the city. There is free transportation to the site. The ship is a bit confusing to navigate on your own. Recommend a guided tour. The shops and restaurants are a bit pricey. But hey!! Give it a loom if you have time to spare,Joseph S
50,Its a big boat and a hotel,It is exactly what you think it would be. A large floating Hotel. English Style hotel on the water. We didn't stay but we took the tour. If you get a chance please go see it. Not bad for a west coast attraction. Even though England is in the east.. Go Sox!,sugarbear02134
50,A quirky alternative to modern hotels,We loved saying on the Queen Mary! We had a huge flight delay getting to LA & we greatly appreciated the help of Elizabeth Chavez who kept us up to date with our room reservations even though we arrived nearly a day and a half late. Parking facilities were excellent- you can easily drive in and out of the carpark with your room key. We were able to choose which style of room we stayed in - a modern room or the original wood room. We opted for the original - it may not want to everyone's tastes but we loved it- it captured the true grandeur of this old lady! Beds were comfy & room was spotless. Promenade deck was great- we had a Starbucks takeaway for breakfast (which was available onboard) in the morning sunshine. Exploring the ship is also a great advantage as you don't have to pay to see it! Wish we could have stayed longer.,SballNewry
50,A walk into the past,"My husbands grandmother sailed on the Queen Mary in 1938. It was amazing to walk the decks, see the areas of the ship where she and friends would have sat, had tea, meals and more. We have mementos from her voyage including a passenger list, final day dinner menu, and storage box! From the design, lots of Art Deco, to the variety of woods, marble, and little details this is like a walk back in history. Not only did it transport Hollywood stars, it was repurposed during WWII to transport troops to and from England, and at the end of the war bring war brides back to the US. This is a must see!!!P.S. - Our tour guide was awesome!!",cndirector1
40,Neat Historic Experience - Just Have to Mind your Head ;),"Walking through the Queen Mary is a real experience (my kids want to go back for the ghost tour).Very interesting all around, from the finishes to the different functions. It's a bit of a learning experience when you are distracted by the overall tour to not continuously trip on the thresholds (water barriers essentially but still a very neat opportunity.We didn't try to the overnight accommodations, but that might be interesting as well and based on a recommendation, used a car service to avoid the parking lot.",Travelbum2005
50,Dinner on the Queen Mary,"The boat is spectacular! we ate dinner there enjoying the decks, and the views. The food was wonderful and the little bit of history in just a short visit was so interesting.",Patti B
50,Excellent Family Activity,"Went with the family (adults, elementary-age child, and toddler) and we ALL enjoyed ourselves! We opted for the Haunted Tour--which took us down into the depths of the ship--and it was a lot of fun! Wear comfy shoes and expect to do a lot of walking--take your time and check out all the nooks and crannies.",celinap
50,Iconic site in Long Beach,"The Queen Mary is definitely worth a visit for first time visitors. Keep an eye their special events (e.g. Halloween, Scottish Festival, etc) and exhibitions which adds to the fun of visiting this floating museum and hotel.",LBK90802
20,Overpriced and very average,"I have to say the history and glamour of this ship is interesting, but it is easy to see how successive companies have failed to make this work. The present operators will also struggle.It is exceptionally over-priced requiring add on tour tickets to see most of the historical rooms of significance. It cost over $100 for our family of 3, and we really only walked along corridors and decks. How they can justify about $20 for parking is beyond me.Overall, interesting but a bit of a rip off",cphiggin
40,A living museum,"The Queen Mary was certainly one of the most significant ocean liners in history and the public are given an opportunity to explore on a self guided audio tour listening to guides that actually worked and travelled on board. The basic tour delivers an excellent opportunity to explore the entire ship at your leisure which should take at least two hours. There are several add ons including a ghost tour which doesn't really offer value other than visiting a few off limit areas including the 1st class pool and post office. A few visiting exhibitions offer an alternative to the main stream museum. At the time of my visit (August), the submarine was closed and certain small sections of the tour were closed for restoration but I don't feel this impacted my experience negatively. This is a must see in the Long Beach area.",NauticalVoyager
50,How they travelled back in the day,"Spent a few hours walking around this vast Liner now used as a Restaurant in Long Beach, it was great way to take you back to see how grandiosity was in them days. The food quality was average nothing special, bit on the pricey side but that aside nice to explore around the corridors and cabins and see how the other half travelled.",World Traveller
30,Ghost tour,We did the day time ghost tour and I found it to be not worth the money!!! It was suppose to be 1 hour and we were done in 50 minutes. We stopped in 5 or 6 areas of the ship and would hear an eerie story that was underwhelming in my opinion. If u have coupons for 50% off it may be worth it to u but do not pay full price as I did!!,Wendy526
50,great experience,"We went after 3 pm and it was free. Some of the exhibits were closed, vut we still had a great tim. Beautiful ship wit a lot of wonderful history. we had a really good tim",nanaf7
50,Wonderful !,I went by myself and rented the audio tour ( $5.00 ) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Relaxing and so much to see. I've lived in LA for 4 years and this was my first visit. I definitely will be back.,Ann R
50,Every visit to the Queen Mary is a good one,"We have stayed at the Queen several times for different events, Steampunk, Highland Games, etc., and every visit is wonderful. If you are going to come and can spend a little extra, I totally recommend getting one of the suites. Well worth the spend.",everythingceltic
40,Princess Diana exhibit,"Yesterday we took an hour or so out to visit the Queen Mary, specifically for the Princess Diana exhibit. The tickets are pricey but this was something we wanted to see. Lots of history and one-of-a-kind items to see. Enjoyable, but only if you like history or museum-type tours.",DMK
40,Nice ship,"The ship itself is beautiful and definitely good for for history buffs. I would caution that you will pay for both parking and tickets. We did both the self guided tour and the ghost tour. If you want to see the swimming pool, you have to go on the ghost tour. The audio equipment for the self guided tour can take a little tweaking. Our tour guide was another thing all together...he was so bad I wAnted to change, but was with a group of friends and family. Later we talked though and all of us felt the same. He should not be doing this job...he was horrible! I do not say that lightly. Everything else on the ship, including other staff were terrific! A man dressed like the captain saw us on the stairs and made a point of talking with us. The man in the ham radio room gave us a personal presentation. The gift shop had a wonderful selection. Overall, I would recommend the ship, but they need to remove the tour guide we had on the ghost tour. He is bitter and sarcastic. The into movie was really good. Also enjoyed the artwork of Churchill. The scale models of ships were informative.",Lisa S
30,Pretty ship,"We were fortunate enough to have a view of the ship from our hotel room. Also my walk around e waterfront to the lighthouse provided great views as well. However with at said, there are many great ships that come into Long Beach. With all the other things to do, not sure this is worth the visit compared to other attractions.",Grover R
40,"""NICE VIEW""",We have visited the Queen Mary twice and it was quite an adventure. They have a place that sells very thick milkshakes and other goodies.We toured the whole place and enjoyed sitting on the deck and enjoying the ocean view.,GUCCI415
20,"so so, average experience","Although kind of cool and the history was somewhat informative, it was just an average experience and overpriced for the value. Here are some things: 1. you pay $12-$18 to park PLUS the tour, 2. poor management of tickets...you had to wait in line for 20 minutes to purchase tickets with only a couple people working..and no kiosks or self serve stations, 3. the tour was I think about $36 a person which includes 2 guided tours, 4. the guided tours about 1 hour each were really not so good--the paranormal was just stories of possible paranormal activity (although the guide was good), 5. and they make you wait for your tour time and they are spaced about 30 minutes apart leaving you nothing to really do, 6. we went on the tour about 12:15, then decided to do the self guided tour only to be told they had run out of recorder guides (how does that happen only 3 hours after opening??), 7. the 4-d movie was lame and felt like an add on that didn't fit tour or ship.",royer91
50,The Grand Dame of ships!,Great experience to enjoy its history... It's a beautiful ship with lovely restaurants and shops. There's also a hotel where you can spend the night and many tours.,ArleneB435
50,A hotel on an ocean liner? Who knew?,"This famous ocean liner of the past will certainly be of interest to those who lived through WWII and the years immediately afterwards. But it should also be of interest to the younger generations who have an interest in history and who want to see the origins of today's amazing cruise ships.It has been lovingly restored to show visitors the way it was. We took the guided tour that takes you over much of the ship that is open to the public. The tour guide was well-informed and made the tour interesting. There are also ""self-guided"" tours and ghost tours but from everything we heard, the basic guided tour is the best. (There is also an exhibit of memorabilia and history involving Princess Diana if you have a family member or friend who recalls and loved Diana.) There is also a continuously running series of short documentaries -- much of it the old black-and-white newsreel footage of the bygone era that was the Queen Mary's heyday. Each segment focuses on one group of people who were involved with the QM such as the American soldiers who travelled to and from Europe on her during the war, the ""war brides"" that the QM brought back from Europe to the U.S. to be reunited with the American soldiers they had married while in England and elsewhere in Europe, or the crew members who served on the QM.You can have lunch and/or snacks, including what is available in a Starbucks coffee shop on board. There are also several gift shops featuring items of clothing, jewelry, children's books, mugs and glasses, etc. -- all of high quality.All in all, the experience was fun and informative and helped me remember my other experiences on ocean liners of that era. (I did travel on the QM, according to my parents, but I was too young to remember it.)",cmaxson1947
40,Grand Old Lady,"Just hopped on for an evening night cap. Was amazed at how beautiful this old boat was. And yes you can tell it's old. Considering that you can appreciate it's history. The bars are bars, nothing special. The views of Long Beach from the c Queen are fabulous.",Patty C
50,Great historic spot!,"The Queen Mary currently serves as a Hotel and event location. There is an adjoining picturesque shopping center for souveniers.The Queen Mary itself is quite lovely and a favorite for several restaurants, the Observation Bar and overall ambience.It is one of the best views of Long Beach.The ship is said to be haunted and there are several tours.Yes, the ship and tours would be ""boring"" to most teenagers, especially if they are not interested in history or know the historical importance of the ship and its many roles.The hotel rooms are spare by modern standards.Local Yacht Clubs choose the location as the site for many parties and ceremonies.I have used the venue for several international business meetings.",VictoriaTravelsToo
30,Average,Average experience - nothing super special or exciting. Our teenager did not like it at all - he said it was boring! Have to purchase a tour just to walk around - not worth the price in our opinion.,li_walk
30,Reception,We attended a reception on the deck of the Queen Mary. It was blazing hot but the views were good. We didn't take any tours and as the ships maiden voyage was in the 1930's you can imagine the ship had an overall run down appearance.,Waters4796
50,Worth a visit especially if you love history!,"I take people from out of town here because it really is a historic icon. The bar at the front of the ship is lovely (art deco-style) and the drinks are good. Parts of the ship seem run down which makes me sad because the history of this ship is incredible. We took an engineer friend down to the engine room which just blew him away! It's amazing what they did back then with what they had. We're so enamored of our technology these days, but their technology was mighty impressive! Oh, also we often go to Sir Winston's for Christmas dinner, not very many good restaurants are open on Christmas and Sir Winston's is great, plus it's a beautiful view at night looking at Long Beach.",joneskelley
50,A Titanic effect,"We went here to check the old ship and its design from the inside and found more than what we expected, this is one for all to see. A nice experience to tour the whole ship and the stories behind it. You wanna know? Visit the Queen Mary and find out yourself. It's a great experience. Thanks",joel matt romul... m
40,Nostalgia / History,"The Queen Mary is a piece of history that is quite fun to walk around in and explore. There are shops, historical displays, great ship models, and an excellent view of the Long Beach skyline.",jrg_LB
50,Tean,Well was a really good place to visit my kids had fun and learn a lot the best part is not having employees following you and telling kids to stop been kids,Norma E
40,Historic,"We were here for a business reception. Food (hors 'doevres) was delicious. But the real beauty of the ship is exploring the historic corridors and displays. Untouched from its historic 40s and 50s hey days, it is a step back in time to luxury travel across the Atlantic. The exhibit on Winston Churchill, who made numerous trips on the Queen Mary, was fascinating. His top hat from the Yalta conference is signed by himself, Stalin and Roosevelt. Wow!!! Very cool.",Lori P
10,Think twice,"I understand that they try to maintain the decor for a true 1930-40s experience but I've seen gas station bathrooms that looked better then theirs. The shower is a trickle, the sink had no stopper so anything you drop ends up in the sewer, and the toilet sprays water out. The biggest complaint from everyone that has stayed there is that the walls are so thin you can hear everything. And I do mean everything. If your neighbors decide to engage in adult type behavior you will have to listen to it all night. I was also able to hear both sides of a phone conversation and it was not on speakerphone. Most importantly ****Beware**** your credit card will be charged for the full length of your stay upon check in, in my case $975. Then at checkout your credit card will be charged AGAIN for the full length of your stay, in my case $975. and the first $975 will be refunded in 7-10 days. At the time of this writing it has been 9 days and I still have not received my $975 deposit. I think it's ridiculous that I have to be out of $1950 to stay there for 5 days. So be prepared to pay double your estimated hotel bill for the time you are there. It's a nice place to visit but I do NOT recommend staying there.",Chris M
30,Going down hill,"I visited the Queen Mary a few years ago and remember it being spectacular. Now, the tour only covers the rooms you can see with the audio tour and the first class ballroom and those are all very worn. This could be such a spectacular place if a little attention were put onto making the tour experience more unique from the audio tour and some of the displays were upgraded. We spent about four hours on the ship both in the tour and exploring on our own. Don't miss the engine room at the bow where there are some good displays and places to explore. Skip the tour and just get the audio. We also enjoyed the bar where drinks are reasonable and you can just bask in the historical feel. We also realized later that people were going straight onto the ship by going directly to restaurants and not paying the admission fee.",diinslc
50,INTERESTING VISIT TO QUEEN MARY,Takes about 1hr on metro from LA city centre on blue line then short bus ride to long beach where Queen Mary is moored. Very interesting guided tour of the ship which is huge-telling the history of the Queen Mary-you can tour around the ship at your leisure after the tour. Recommended for lunch the chelsea chowder house on board-good selection for $36 inc beer. Nice view of harbour if lucky to get window table. other attractions nearby if you have longer in area.,SIMON R
40,Definitely worth a visit,"We went for the 1st class ticket which included 2 tours and the audio headsets. We had lunch on board which was ok, the service was good. The Princess Diana exhibition was excellent with lots of interesting information about the whole royal family. The ghost tour wasn't that great but the tour guide certainly knew his information. The Alcatraz exhibition was also very interesting. The history of this magnificent ship, including her service during WW2 makes this a 'must see' tourist destination. Unfortunately we ran out of time for the audio tour. The gift shops have done great things to remember your visit.",Thelma B
50,Lovely day exploring this historical monument!,"We had a delightful day exploring this beautiful, historical ship. If walls could talk... Don't miss the engine room. We did the historical tour and it was well done and very good. Highly recommend!",Psyprof51
40,"Interesting, but getting worn","Interesting to walk the decks, but this big ship is expensive to maintain and that money doesn't seem to be there. Looking date and worn. One of the two elevators had been out of service for two weeks. Food is good; service is also good.",Emily R
50,Great Place for Date or Family,"Service, drinks, food are excellent. Hotel is awesome experience. Tours are fun and informative. Ship is amazing. We did the Paranormal Investigation, and THAT WAS FUN. The exterior is in need of a paint job, and there are cleaning and repair issues needed but overall - great place, value and character. Definitely going back.",DonSuttonLBCA
40,4th of July Fireworks on the Queen Mary,"Booked the VIP admission for the fireworks which were greatBut overpriced..I thought they were going to be discounted by 50%..Shoud have read the fine print. The Queen Mary was very interesting, but so much more for all the extra tours and very crowded. I would not pay $99 for the fireworks, but now we have seen the ship.",Q2528CGjoanb
40,Fantastic Piece of History,"If you are in this area it is an attraction well worth the time to visit. We had a great lunch in the restaurant, clam chowder and shrimp quesadilla's. They had chicken but not shrimp quesadilla's on the menu so the chef put this together special for us, it was very very good. Had a great tour guide and was able to see and learn about the Queen Mary and it's rich history. My only regret is that we did not have enough time to explore more of the ship on our own after the tour, so I would recommend 3 to 4 hours to really get to see this ship.",Tim M
50,We absolutely loved the tour and the price was really worth what you received.,"We bought our pass on the Go La site and we got a 20% discount. With our ticket we received the self guided audio tour, a ghost guided tour and a 4d movie. We stayed on the ship for probably 8 hours. We really enjoyed seeing a 20-30's era passenger ship.",Robert W
50,Quick walk after dining within Ship,"I can only review on just my walk exploration of this beautiful historic ship.After dinner, I was able to walk around with my young kids and wished we had more time.There are guided history, as well as paranormal tours offered at ground level before entrance into The Queen Mary. We dined at Chelsea restaurant up on the 3rd floor deck.This ship reminds me how it would be during the time of ""the Titanic"". There are artifacts and signs throughout the halls of the decks with insightful info on the ship's past. But the beauty and amazingness is walking around outdoors on top of the deck to view City of Long Beach and outlying areas, watch the boats and water activites passby.There were about 3 exclusive venues taking place arpund the boat at the time we visited. A wedding, graduation and birthday....some indoors and others on a separately closed off outdoor deck by a wooden gazebo. Great old historical feel atmosphere.",Alvinobambino
50,A step back in time,"Yes, she's 80. Yes, her glory days are behind her. But what a wonderful experience to stay on the Queen Mary and feel transformed back to the '30s. Oversized black and white photographs adorn the ship illustrating famous movie stars, politicians, and celebrities who traveled at sea. Several restaurants and bars provide meal options so you don't need to disembark. The self audio tour leads you up, down, and around to every corner of the ship. It's not a Hampton. It's not a Hilton. It's not supposed to be. Enjoy the experience!",JQuilter
40,"A long walk, but very worthwhile tour","We took the self-guided tour where they give you a player and headsets and you traverse the ship learning the history and seeing the different areas of the ship. You get to go in some surprising areas like the bridge and engine room (and even view one of the propellers) and the narration is very informative. The script is a bit out of date because some of the areas mentioned are no longer accessible for whatever reason and then you have to figure how to get around them in order to pick up the next stop on the tour. The Princess Diana exhibit is okay if you're a Diana or Royals fanatic, but it may bore you if you are not. They also had a Alcatraz exhibit, which seemed totally out of place for this tour, so we skipped it entirely.We are avid cruisers, so this tour had significance for us.",John S
50,Champagne Sunday Brunch,"The brunch is a self service buffet and the food is really good. Various sections but we couldn't visit each one because we'd simply had enough to eat.The brunch gives access to the rest of the ship and it's great. For me, the engine room was fascinating.Great way to spend a few hours and enjoy a wonderful brunch.",Moz01
20,"Once nice, now shabby.","The city of Long Beach should be ashamed of the condition of this ""attraction"". Bathrooms and much of the tour areas very dirty. Holes in wooden decking, trip hazards before you even get on the ship. Parking price is criminal. Military discount only available @ ticket office on pier location, then they charge $2.00 service fee for each ticket sold at that site. Better price available online with other discounts. My children had fun, but it was not a good value for the price. The water in the pool around the one remaining screw was so sorry you could barely see the exhibit. Signs and audio your need to be updated and improved. Audio tour did not function well, levels and signs related to the tour were poor at best. The grimey staging of the forward pool area due to use in a ""haunted"" type show made this less than impressive to see. Over all, I am left with this impression: Dirty, over priced, unsafe public owned attraction. Will not recommend.",Jonathan L
20,Historic Ship now 80,"The grand dame of the sea needs a lot of work! Paint is faded and blistering, teak decks are uneven and nasty looking. Fix this boat! Dined at Sir Winston's and had a terrible steak (not Prime, not even Choice!), For $139!",Chris R
40,The Queen,"We have stayed before and usually enjoy it. We did enjoy it this time as well but it does need a little up keep.Also, they billed us for parking when we didn't even have a car. They did take it off but if we had my looked that would have been an extra $40.00.It is right next to the port for Carnival so easy walking to get on a cruise.Also, free passport bus is right out front which takes you to town.",jntravlers
10,Unhappy,I already wrote I was very unhappy with the Queen Mary .Terrible service price is ridiculous. I will never recommend.,nonosmom
40,Was fun and a piece of history,"Really enjoyed the exhibit of being on the Queen Mary. We did beat his stork tour. The only downside was we were not able to get into any of the state rooms, as they are all rented as well as the ballroom because there was a function. I would've really been fun to do. Otherwise, it was a great time and I would recommend if you're in the Long Beach area.",PastorTrike
40,Nice Relaxing Vacation Day on the Queen Mary,"We spent over a week in the LA area and thought of going to Catalina. Unfortunately, the weather didn't look all that great so we spent a few hours on the Queen Mary. We did the historical tour with the enthusiastic Captain James.This is a pleasant diversion from any go-go day at the theme parks. Our son is 14, I'd be hesitant on kids under 8.Including lunch at Chelsea Chowder House, we spent 4 hours on the boat.",Bill C
50,A day event,We took the history tour . They take you all over the ship and tell you who sailed back in the old days how they had 1st class 2nd class and 3rd class passengers and how they were all treated different back then.The hotel rooms were all booked so we didn't get to see the different rooms.There is a fee to go on the ship you can save with triple A if you have it .,James L
40,Love the old lady,"We stayed onboard to celebrate an anniversary. The Queen Mary is great if you have any liking of history at all. You can spend hours just walking the decks and looking at pictures and displays. However, I recommend taking a tour, either guided or audio. Also the display of Lady Dianna's dresses and memoriabilia is well worth seeing. Also, there is a new display of about ten of Winston Churchill's paintings. Don't miss this.",Labonnevie_12
50,Not To Be Missed,"My third visit in 25 years and, although magnificent from a historic and engineering viewpoint, it's sad to see the decline in upkeep and maintenance. Entire areas of teak decking are rotting away and it's obvious they have not painted her in decades. Water stained ceilings and torn carpet abound inside. It really is a shame, because there is so much potential and I shudder to consider the condition of her hull below the waterline as she has not seen a drydock in almost 50 years. I only hope the current owners have the funds to change fix this situation before it's too late. The Diana exhibit was OK if you are into that sort of thing. The exhibit of huge liner models was much more interesting.",Jeff W
50,Must do!!!!,"Best tour ever! We were there for hours. Regular tour and haunted tour. Self.guided tour with digital players make it easy to go around. Such great history to see. Would love to spend the night in the hotel. Tons of stairs, better be in shape to investigate this huge ship. Will go back",blueeyed23

Our tour guide was funny, adapted his pace to kids and seniors, and had things to say that delighted all ages. Waiting outside in the heat in line for tickets was very bad, though. Be sure to budget time for the tedious repetition of explanations at the window for each group as they attempt to assess which tours they want to see and what is included in the arbitrary ""packages"" that the QM offers. Advice: go to the website and decide in advance. Our group of 6: 2 adults, 2 kids and 2 seniors got the gal at the window so confused herself that she initially ended up selling us 8 tickets. Thank goodness we stayed and corrected the error, and got the credit while she was still there and could quickly fix it. Meanwhile, the rest of us sat in a tiny patch of shade under a potted tree, wilting in the 80+ degree heat. Our whole group opted for the ship tour, the Alcatraz exhibit and a 4-D movie. As soon as we checked the tour and movie times, we decided to have lunch. Wow, terrific food and great service! Nice views of the downtown Long Beach coastline from the restaurant. Two of us (ladies) added admission to the Diana exhibit. Boy, was that a good decision. After the ship tour, the boys sat in the ship's lounge outside the shops, while we toured the many, many rooms and displays. As a 2nd generation Brit on my Mom's side, I wouldn't have missed the vast collection - photos and china to be expected, but the doll collection was stunning as were Diana's iconic gowns. After we joined the boys, it was off to the ""behind bars"" segment showcasing the inmates and guards that spent years on both sides of the bars of Alcatraz. Super place for pictures. Finally, we went to the 4-D theater. First, while waiting for the previous feature to end, we got to sit on upholstered benches and watch TV screens showing a montage of movie scenes that were filmed on the Queen Mary over the years. Terrific for a movie buff like me, but surprisingly lots of more recent movies included stars more familiar to the non-seniors in our group. Ah! finally the movie experience. Since it was included in the package, and we didn't want to wait an hour to see Planet Earth, we adults gamely agreed to see the Sponge Bob Square Pants 16 minute feature. Well, nothing about this film was boring! First we took our seats, put away electronics and were told not to put our feet on the seats in front of us. Best advice if you want to really get the full ""treatment."" Next, put on the 3-D glasses (which leaves you wondering, what IS the 4th dimension?) Not to worry, the cartoon begins with a trip through a porthole and into the deep blue sea - followed by real bubbles cascading down from the ceiling and a squirts of misted water in your face! So much fun to see ALL the adults giggle and shriek just as much as the kids. Not perhaps, for the tiny toddler, but very real seeming, especially as the seats vibrate, tickle the backs of your calves with light, flexible plastic ""fingers"" when the school of jellyfish surround you onscreen. That was delightfully scary. More bubbles and water near the end and very fast moving action. A very swift 16 minutes. Afterwards, the guide showed us one of the ship's propellers in the water visible from inside in a specially built room onboard. All in all about 3.5 hours and well worth it!",Linda D
30,All right,Ship isn't kept up on any floor beyond where hotel is...staff very unhelpful and hard to find. Did Ghost Tour and it was decent,greenies04
40,"Great old cruise liner, fascinating history and ocean views","I had been on the Queen Mary before but had never taken the formal tour of the ship. The tour was fascinating as we started in the bottom of the ship by the engine room and worked our way up to the top. We heard a lot of history of the ship being used for a military transport, saw much of the ornate architecture, visited private dining rooms and bars and viewed the ship from the outer decks. If I went again I would take the self guided tour with the audio headsets and spend lots of time looking at all the history, pictures, diagrams and features. Nice gift shop on board and coffee shop near by. We had a formal dinner in one of the dining rooms and the food and service was outstanding. NOT your typical old cruise ship.",in2travelling
50,Wedding,We went to a wedding on the Queen Mary. It was absolutely beautiful. The view from the deck is awesome. The seagulls will come close and eat out of your hand. Awesome experience.,ratfd
40,A lot cooler than I was expecting,Our room was very nice and still has the old charm of the ship when it was in service. Staff was friendly and you even get a free tour of it included with your stay. Very neat experience but like any other tourist attraction be prepared to overpay for any extras (particularly the on board restaurant). They do offer a free shuttle downtown which is super convenient also. Overall it was a just a cool experience.,Mitch H
50,TOURS AND EXHIBITIONS,"The two main tours (general and haunted) and tall the exhibitions were wonderful in every way. The 'ROYALS/QUEEN DIANA"" exhibition was great.",pj1945
50,"Variety, History, Mystery, and more","My daughters and I soaked in a history filled afternoon aboard the Queen Mary. Took in the Ghosts and Legends tour and it fulfilled our expectations. We also did the tour with the headphones/guided audio tour - learned quite a bit. Take your time and read the stories, absorb the mystique, have lunch and a cocktail in the Observation Bar & Art Deco Lounge. The servers were great and quality food. Do go on a sunny day for photo ops. Heads up on the parking fees...$25...ouch. It's SoCal so suck it up and pay it.",Montanagilmore
50,Classic,"Did a ghost exploration and and a wonderful breakfast buffet. It never get old....just sit, soak it in, listen, do not rush through anything.",doc0205
50,Absolutely breathtaking,There are almost no words to describe how absolutely amazing this ship is!! It's well worth the money to take any of the tours offered!! My boyfriend and I did the haunted ghost tour. Only one where you can see the pool area (definitely a 10+ on creep factor!!) Don't forget you have the ability to wonder around and explore the ship in all Her greatness!! Next time I'll be staying aboard because she also has rooms you can stay over in.,Jean L
40,Showing her wear,"We loved the history and romance of the ship. She tells wonderful stories. We enjoyed all the info in pictures, stories and film throughout the ship. Everyone had a great visit.However, she is in need of some TLC. While most areas are in great shape, if you look outside the main focus, the paint is shipping and faded, the wood needs replaced in many spots. I would hope that with more visitors this magnificent icon could do some refurbishment.",b5orange
50,Tour,What a great experience but be careful there is a lot of climbing of stairs and no alternative. The engine room is very deep and made one of our group quite claustrophobic. Tea with the Diana experience is fantastic,Carolg1956
30,Enjoyable enough,"I remember really enjoying this place as a kid. Seems like it's a lot less enjoyable as an adult, but it has nice views and is kept very clean.",Adam M
40,Took a couple tours on the Queen Mary.,"A few of us took a few tours on the Queen Mary, Glory Days Tour and Haunted Encounters Tour. Found both of them very informative and the tour guides were so good. Who knew so many movies had been filmed in various parts of the ship. Parking was good - lots of walking and stairs.We only spent a few hours there, however the history of it and checking out each available deck could take much longer. Easy to find.",Lorisreview
50,Tea and ghost tour,"I wanted to do something fun and fancy while in the area with our seven-year-old. She loved the tea and all of the food served (she ordered off of the children's menu). All of the food had a wonderful presentation and tasted good (lite tea). We decided to do the ghost tour, which gave a decent tour of the boat as well as some tidbits of the history of the ship. Overall a fun trip. Tip: take a taxi to avoid parking fees :)",Otg8rgrl02
50,Interesting!,Biggest ship we have ever seen...very interesting..just visited and walked around outside to museum area.,Gina M
30,Quirky Tour,"It was good to see this ship built in Glasgow at its home in Long Beach. There are various tours on offer and we did one that gave an overview of a couple of the decks including access to a couple of the function rooms. The tour guide was a bit of a character but his style started to annoy quickly. Worth a look if in Long Beach,",tartan_penguin
20,Historical site in Disrepair,This is a unique historical site unfortunately it is in disrepair. Staff also is lacking service skills and basic friendliness.,diamondbargal
40,Family Vacation 2016,"We purchased the one hour haunted ghost tour. The tour was ok, but a bit pricey for the one hour time limit. I would still rate the Queen Mary high due to your ability to explore areas on your own with I time limits.",Mark M
50,well worth a visit,Beautiful machine. Walk in the footsteps of Audrey Hepburn and Churchill. Plenty of original fittings.,emmachisett
40,Guided tour.,"Ok so you need a guided tour so that everything makes more sense, lots of things that are not written in the ship are explained. The 4D experience is fun, about 15 minutes long. We got there like at 5 and the audio tour was not available anymore so that was sad. It's pretty big so expect a lot of walking.",pllara16
30,Could be a lot better,"Our tickets included the haunted tour. When we arrived we we told out your would be an hour later than we booked online. They sent us to another part of the boat to pass some time and we were told told to arrive ten minutes before the tour start time. The tour guide showed up 20+ minutes late.Overall, the experience could be better with more organization and better access. The Queen Mary features a hotel in the staterooms and that might be a cool way to experience it.",Shivwits
50,"Great fun at the haunted tour, and overall amazing tour.","We took the haunted tour, along with the rest of the self guided tour. It has to be the closest thing to the Titanic there is. We crawled around in the engine room. We loved every inch of this ship. We could only imagine the parties, and royalties that have been on this ship. Next time we will book a room.",Scott W
50,The Royal Treatment!,I wished I could have spent the entire day on this ship - the historical walking tour - highly recommend it - Our docent ( I believe his name was James) clearly knows his facts and made our tour incredibly enjoyable! There are so many things to learn about this historical ship - fascinating!,reagangirl70
50,A step back in the past,"This ship is much larger than I imagined, being one and a half times the size of the Titanic. The guided tour is very interesting, but you also need to take more time to explore those areas with public access. The ship is also a working hotel, with very long corridors. They also have regular special exhibitions. Great views over Long Beach.",Alan L
40,Take a step back in time,"How wonderful to wonder this beautiful ship....the history was well put together and very informative. ..you must take,the haunted tour.....what great fun....loved it",tanamiller
40,woth paying for visiting,"Loved the visit to the Queen Mary. It is quite expensive but it was woth! Loved the LadyDi´s exhibitionn. I would have loved to see the inside of the rooms, chappel and other , not only through a window.",CynthiaGV
40,A Grand old Queen...,Loved the Queen Mary.. make sure you take the option to do both guided tours as the tour guides are knowledgeable and bring the history of the ship to life.,pookyandjo
50,Worth it,Definitely worth paying for the guided tours and behind the scenes action. This ship is so iconic and legendary and its magnitude will compound you.,SouthernPineapples
50,Memorable experience,We decided to go on a spare of the moment. Had no issues making a reservation within the next hour.We had a table next to the window. Gorgeous. Service was excellent. Good food. Definitely a memorable experience.,Kat4861
50,Restful Nights Sleep,We spent one night on this old nostalgic ship and had a great time. No problems what so ever with the room and service. We spent a lot of our time on board reading about the history of it.,Melvin H
50,Take a guided tour,The Queen Mary is huge and has a lot of history. Make sure to do the self guided tour or with a tour guide. We did the haunted tour and it was interesting to hear first hand stories from our guide. Plan to spend a few hours here so you can soak it all in.,missie1972
10,Terrible,Already posted in detail. Under no circumstances will I stay there again. Stay there only if like like rude personnel and rooms that stink.,Anthony W
50,Beautiful Place with Beautiful History,"Such a beautiful ship! Just looking at it across the harbor from our hotel room was thrilling. We spent an entire afternoon on this ship and could have stayed longer. The ship is stunning with its original woods and furnishings. It is kept as well as a ship that old and docked in a harbor can be. People were working on it, quietly touching things up and cleaning while we were there. It is rich in history and brings patriotism alive to hear and read about the people who have traveled on it for leisure as well as for war rescue purposes. There are wonderful displays throughout the ship. The crew is friendly and knowledgeable. We took the Haunted Tour in the afternoon. It was family oriented-history and ""sightings"" were shared as well as plenty of humor to tone any worry. Our tour guide, Robert was amazing. He was fun, easy, and watched out for every member of our party. He knew his stuff and you could ask him anything. I only wish we would have gotten a picture with him. Great way to spend the day. Well worth the time and money.",Heather W
50,A Great Attraction - The Majesty of this Great Ship!,"My wife and I toured the Queen Mary just recently and so enjoyed our visit! The ship is huge and we were told the fastest ship of its time. We took the self-paced, audio tour and found out a great deal about the ship. We were at the ship for about 4 or 5 hours but could have used an additional couple of hours to see more of the ship. There were alot of activities going on the ship that day that included a high school graduation and college graduation and a wedding. What a great setting for a wedding. We go a chance to see the ship from bow to stern and many of the different floors including 1st, 2nd and 3rd classes. My favorite area was the engine room. What massive engines and turbine and props. Just an enormous area to move such a big vessel. There was also a viewing area where you could see an actual prop attached to the ship. A 33 ton prop. There were 4 of them to move the ship forward. What a grand history this majestic maiden has. It was well worth the $56 that we spent on the admission. Go see this for sure!!!",BobbyRose
40,nice afternoon - do the afternoon tea !!!,"dd the princess Diana tour with tea, booked online and printed tickets but when we went to the tea room they didn't have our booking ... explained we didn't see this but they were happy to seat us as it was quiet but if busy then it may have been different .. warning to people if you book this ensure you book your tea slot.The whole ship is interesting and well worth the visit for a few hours.I would recommend you do the afternoon tea package - this was excellent for US standards of serving afternoon tea.The Diana exhibition was OK, wouldn't say it was great but all part of the ship visit.",perky88
40,A little frayed around the edges but her personality still shines through,"Had a fabulous day on the old Queen after getting off one of the new cunarders that docked not far from her. It was great to compare the old style of cruising with the new and it was good to see that the ship was buzzing with a lot of tourists doing the same. Although tired and frayed...it is disappointing to see her maintenance so badly neglected in certain areas, her big personality still shines through the off cheap money saving repairs that have been done. For instance some of the decking has been replaced not with teak planking as it would have been originally but plywood with painted lines where the calking would have been.It would be expensive keeping her up to her original standard and I applaud those who are trying to keep her as a going concern.A thoroughly recommended day out for anyone interested in ships.",roscoe39
40,Part of a package - not to bad,We had a package that allowed us to be admitted at a discount. Not sure i would have paid full price. You can take a guided tour (we did the historic one and had a very fun guide) or self guided. Take as long as you want. If you miss something on the tour you can go back.,Jrhender74
40,a glimpse into a more elegant era of travel,"I liked standing in the ballroom where the likes of Liberace and Frank Sinatra performed. I liked learning of the ship's history. I suggest taking a basic, one-hour tour. I liked looking at the historic photos on the wall. I didn't stay at the hotel or dine in the restaurant, so I cannot comment on those aspects. It might be a bit over-priced, but then again, I suppose it's expensive to keep the ship maintained.",Yodelman
30,Shabby area,"We had planned to take a tour but on arrival it wasn't clear where to buy tickets. When we did find the ticket booth the price was high for what you got. But strangely I would have paid more if I had been convinced it was going to be worth it. The area looked like a cheap amusement park, very tacky. Put us off so we decided against going aboard. I hope I am wrong about this and the ship is still as lovely. I think whoever owns the land adjacent should smarten it up.",Christine R
30,Needs a Lot of Work,"I enjoyed reading the stories and watching the videos of the history of the Queen Mary....BUT.... The ship is in desperate need of painting and updating...There needs to be cheaper places to eat on board (the day we were there...the buffet was $45.00 per person who can afford that??). As I am older and semi disabled, trying to get into the handicap parking was a nightmare and no staff to help. There is not enough benches or other seating for anyone to take a rest,,,even in the hotel lobby there was few chairs and they were all taken.When we went down into the engine room it was pitch black...people wandering around bumping into things...The staff had forgotten to turn on the lights (hubby went up and told them). The quaint English Village shops outside the ship are all closed..I was very disappointed.....It all just looks so neglected now......I remember when it was free to park, the village was full of shops and places to eat, and the Queen looked majestic",Susan B
20,NOT WORTH THE COST TO GET IN!,"Each time I visit Southern California I tell myself I should try and see the Queen Mary in Long Beach and each time, I decide just to stay in Orange County and see the sights there. This time I decided to take the drive to Long Beach which wasn't a bad drive. You just head north on the I-405 and take the I-710 heading South. Be careful though, there aren't too many signs to tell you how to get to the Queen Mary off of the I-710. Once you get there you learn that the cost of parking is tricky. If you stay less than 30 minutes the parking is free. If you stay from 30 minutes to 2 hours the parking is $5 and if you stay longer than 2 hours, the parking is $18. You heard me right, $18! Then you get hit with the cost to get in to see the Queen Mary. If you want to see any of their tours, they make sure they schedule you for a tour that starts more than 2 hours from when you buy the ticket. That way they know for sure they will be able to collect the $18 fee for parking. I selected two tours, The Glory Days Tour and the Haunted Encounters Tour and the total was $38. After spending two hours seeing the ship on my own which was boring as hell and then taking the two tours, I felt as though I was ripped off. There is very little to see on the ship and certainly not worth the $56 I paid. Each of the tours was one hour long which is about 45 minutes too long. The tour guides took a small amount of information and stretched it out as best they could to fill up the allotted time. I certainly can not see myself going back to see this attraction again. This is one of those times that once is enough, especially if you've been ""taken"". If you're hoping to see one of their ""ghosts"", good luck with that. No one in recent history has seen anything or heard anything.",jim30122
40,Group Tours & Dinner,"I am an event planner and can definitely recommend the Queen Mary & their staff for a fun filled activity for groups. We had a group of around 35 people who enjoyed the Commodore's presentation on the history of the Queen Mary followed by a ghost tour with the finale being dinner at the Chelsea Chowder House, overlooking Long Beach at night. A wonderful experience was had by all and the group was well entertained by the Queen's staff. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an interesting & fun thing to do while in Long Beach.",H C
30,Great history and well presented but service was awful,This was a disaster - we were checked in and then sent on wild goose chase to find our welcome pack. Disgraceful service - and the Americans expect 20% this was not worth any tips in the reception team.Fortunately we eat in the sir winston Churchill and wow what a treat.,Kev R
40,"Great tours, beautiful ship, needs refurbishing","When you get to the Queen Mary site, you have to get a parking ticket in order to go in. The first 30 min is free, but after that, you have to pay. Day parking is $18 on regular days and more for special events. Overnight parking for hotel guests is $20 per night. With restaurant validation, self-parking for up to 3 hours is $8 and valet is $15. Special event parking rates vary. So be sure you know what you want to do or else you will be paying more money for parking than you should.Once you find parking, you can walk a short distance to the ticket booth that is located towards the bow (front) of the ship in the parking lot. I recommend purchasing your tickets in advance online. The entrance to the ship is towards the center of the ship. You will see it because it is a tall vertical tower that has an elevator that takes you to the ship's entrance. Before you go up, you have to show the host(ess) you ticket. Once your ticket is validated, they will let you enter.You could tell that in her heyday, the Queen Mary was a beautiful sight to behold. I did notice that the outside of the ship needed a new paint job. It's beginning to look old and rusted like nobody wants to take care of her. You have the option of roaming the ship on your own, taking a self guided tour with an audio player, or taking a guided tour. We did both a self guided tour without the audio player and a guided tour. For the self guided tour, we basically walked the entire ship and took pictures from different parts of the ship. We were able to explore at our own pace and almost go to the all the parts of the ship that you would go on a guided tour. The bad thing is you don't get to hear the history of the ship or some interesting facts that you would get on a guided tour. If you plan on doing the self guided audio tour, go to level 2 (R deck). There are signs for you to follow that lead you to the pick up area. There you can pick up the headset for the self guided tour. You will have to leave your photo id. If you are going for a guided tour, you will need to go to level 4 which is the Promenade deck.We did the Paranormal Shipwalk Tour at 9:30pm. They recommend ages 16 and over but on our tour there were some kids about 9-10 years old. It was fine at first, but then they kept interrupting the tour guide and it became annoying. So if you bring younger kids on the tour, please let them know that if they want to ask questions do not interrupt the tour guide. They will ask if you have any questions. For our tour, they told us to wait in the main hall which has some seats and tables for you to relax in. They ask that you arrive 5 minutes before your scheduled tour time. The tour guide showed up and scanned our tickets and we were on our way. Our tour covered a bit of history of the ship, the pool area where some sightings have occurred, the engine room, an area outside where sightings of Sir Winston Churchill have happened, the Officers' quarters, the bridge (where the steering wheels for the ship are located), the radio room (actual volunteers are working here), and the rudders of the ship. The tour was late at night so it was a bit creepy walking around a huge ship with nobody around except the people in your group. Some of the spaces that you have to walk through are very tight and small. After all, this is an old ship and back then they know about being ADA compliant. So if you would like to take this tour, realize that you will have to walk in some places. I would take this tour again. It was fun, creepy, and informative at the same time.There is plenty to do while on board this magnificent ship. You have several dining options as well as several tour guide options. They also have combination tickets for the Queen Mary and other attractions nearby.

50,Unique and Mystifying,"The opportunity to take a private executive tour will have you thinking twice!! This tour lasted approx. 3.5 HRS and starts midnight. Plan to wear loose fitting clothes and sneakers. .. First, the ship has had numerous deaths (employees and guest). Second, if you are a non believer or disbeliever in regards to ghosts or spirits.....think twice. I can assure you that beliefs do change. There are certain areas of the ship that had to be blocked off..due to spirit unrest!!! This area is off limits to general public. The history, employees of the company and antiquity all tie together the Ships Personality!!! The Stories are Real!!!!",Windman69
50,A Magnificent Ship,"We are very proud of our British heritage in the Queen Mary. She is a magnificent ship with amazing stories to tell. Our visit did not disappoint. She is clean and welcoming with all her grandeur in place. The tourist elements have not spoilt her, the dining options and gift shops and even the take home photos are very well done. Thank you Long Beach for looking after her so well.",Redcetera
40,So much fun!,"I've heard quite a few stories about the Queen Mary and could not pass up the opportunity of visiting the ship during my trip! Once I stepped foot on it, I felt like I was living the life of those who had the walked through those decks in the past. I learned that it's not only a ship for you to explore in but it's also a hotel and restaurant! There's plenty of interactive things to do when going around it and lots to learn from. If you're ever in Long Beach, this place is something you must visit!",Mac L
40,USA Tour,As we were staying on the ship we were able to do the self guide audio tour for free. This was an interesting tour round the ship giving you all the information you needed. Before we started we had our photographs taken and at the end we could purchase these in a souvenir album for $35. A worthwhile memory of our trip..,Linda S
50,All aboard!! Sail back in time.,Wow!Step on board and you transfer back in time. It was like being on the ship In the 1930's when it took voyage. I'm glad to see the queen live and well for people to enjoy and be amazed off the history it portrays. If your going to long beach this is a must see excursion. I'm not going to go into too much detail because you need to see it in person. If you have extra time you can book a night stay to really experience the ship. I would recommend to look up the history off the ship before you go so you can see what you want to do ahead off time.,Rich K
40,Viewed from the Dockside,"After our visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific we didn't have the time to ""do a tour"" of the QM and opted to just try to get close enough for a photo of the grand old lady. We were delighted to arrive at the parking lot to discover that the facility offered free parking for a short while for visitors such as us. We were able to get our pics and left happy. If circumstances permit, we'll aim for a visit (if not stay) in the future.",Alan P
40,Lots to do,"The Queen Mary is not only a hotel but it offers activities to keep you entertained for a day. Don't miss out on the restaurants, great food.",Yorka V
50,Take a trip back in time on this old lady of the seas,We were in Long Beach for a conference and forced to play tourist for a day so we went to tour the Queen. Wow what a trip into the past this was. They had a great series of historical short movies of people that had been on or affected by the ship over the past and we learned a lot of it's history from that. We got to freely walk around many parts of the ship and learned a lot from the audio tour that is included with the cost of the tour. Then we got to go into one of the engine rooms. WOW is all I can say to that. If you are a lover of all things mechanical as I am. That alone made it worth the price. Incredible .All in all a fine way to spend a portion of your day in Long Beach. I highly recommend this,suptheusa
50,Once again,"Another amazing cruise on the Queen Mary. We spent 3 nights on a cruise to nowhere .Our room was a mini suite with two bathrooms, two television's, two beds and the classic style and feel of many years gone by. We enjoyed room service more than once. The Sunday CHAMPAGNE Brunch was incredible. Sir Winston's was gourmet in a sense of being completely sent back to a time that was of legend. My wife and I can't wait to do it all over again.",ClassicCouple
30,NICE PLACE TO REMEMBER THE TITANIC STORY!,"Interesting place to compare the luxury, class, etc between the old transatlantic ships and the actual ""floating hotels"" crowded with children, miscellaneous person without class and drunk people!",Wankenne
50,Queen Mary Sunday Brunch Great Brunch!,After hearing about the Queen Mary Sunday Brunch for Years we finally had opportunity to go to the buffet.It is an excellent buffet with all the bells and whistles.Held in the Grand Salon the buffet presentation is of an glamour era gone by.There many different types of stationsSo this buffet does not disappoint the guests dining there.There is a photographer before you go in to brunch. Take the photo with your party. It's a great souvenir especially if you are the photographer and are rarely in the photos when traveling.,Sandy W
40,Interesting history,"We took the guided tour and found it excellent. After the tour we explored on our own. The ship can be confusing getting around so take your time, don't give up and ask directions if necessary. It is easy to spend 3-4 hours there. In the rear of the ship is a movie no really related to the ship but interesting just the same. There also is a Alcatraz exhibit that is interesting. Be prepared for a lot of walking and stair climbing.",hfdad
50,My Experience on The Majestic Queen Mary,"My Tour on The Queen Mary was rather Enjoyable. My Tour guide was the same James as was in this persons tour. James does a wonderful job as Tour guide. I also find the manner in which he gives his tour Which is the Art Deco Tour to be very informative and Absolute Delight. I would be Proud to have a person like James in my employment if I were the owner of the ship. There are Three guided Tours Offered on Ship 1. Art Deco, 2 ww2 and of course Ghosts and legends. If your into ghosts that's the tour is for you o a Soviet era Foxtrot class Diesel power Submarine that you can tour as well however this tour is self guided. but not to worry there is a recording of a gentleman in each compartment explaining every thing and I found it very interesting and worth a visit. If your hungry there are several places which you can choose. I highly encourage you to visit this wonderful ship of a bygone era. James is such a Delight I just don't know what this persons problem was. but Their loss i Guss. The Queen Mary has a Facebook page so be sure to check it out there is always a fun event coming up so be sure to like the page so you to can get in on the deals and special offers and Dare I say it GIVEAWAYS!!!!!!!!! .",Timothy G
50,A surprisingly great day out.,"We were in Long Beach with no plans so decided to visit the Queen Mary. We spent 4.5 hours there doing the audio tour plus a guided historical tour. We ate in the nostalgic Observatory Bar and soaked up the sun on one of the decks as if we were real passengers. It was a fabulous day for adults.... Kids might not get the historical significance. She is an amazing ship, obviously loved by those who work there. I wish we'd known it wasn't too expensive to stay there and we definately would have.",Shezza20132013
50,It was an amazing night!,"We spend a night in the Queen Mary and we enjoyed it a LOT! We are in awe! We joined the 2 hours paranormal tour and our tour guide Tony was so funny. I told my husband that I like him, he makes the tour fun instead of being creepy. We will be back this time next year!",Charmaine S
50,Amazing Piece of History!,"We spent one night here for my husband's birthday. We ate at Sir Winston's, walked around the beautiful ship, had a DELICIOUS drink on the observation deck...we played like we were tourists! It was a very memorable birthday!",Fay T
50,Queen Mary fun day.,"Very interesting and fun day on the Queen must include a stop at the Wireless Radio Room. It is the only live exhibit on the Queen. It is manned by volunteers from the Long Beach Amateur Association who are full of fun facts about the Queen Mary, her wireless radios and other miscellaneous tidbits of information.",BigBill45
40,Interesting tour,"As many times as I have been to Long Beach, I have not explored the Queen Mary until now, Take one of the tour packages if you are interested in the history of it. They accept AAA also. Plan for a full day on the boat to get the most out of it, if you are doing a package. They also offer self audio, but that is also included in First class package. I did not stay in the hotel, but got to tour one of the larger suites. Big room, but it was a suite.They have a free bus called the Passport that will take you from Queen Mary, aquarium and village section and convention area. The regular bus lines in the area are for a nominal fee.Beautiful views!",purpletmc
50,Great Afternoon Tea British Style!!!,"As a Scot, it was great to come half way around the world and see the Queen Mary (built in Scotland) looking fabulous and luxurious as if she had just set sail all those years ago.She is a classy ocean liner in the current days of cruise ships and still felt current.We had afternoon tea and it was fabulous, amazing service and the selection of cakes and sandwiches was great!! The loose leaf teas were also excellent.This ocean liner got us set for our cruise!!!",GavJ442014
40,Neat place,"Did the haunted tour ($60) for 2. Kinda neat we were really hoping to see more stuff, like a actual hotel room to see if we would ever stay there. Very cool art deco look. Not much else to do but walk around",JodieC25
50,"I'm not scared, it's just dark!","1st, wear comfortable shoes and try to not carry a bunch of stuff (jackets, bags, etc.) The passages on the Queen are often narrow and steep. This boat is HUGE and you are walking for the entire 2 hours, but it is completely worth getting to see parts of the boat that you can't get to without the tour. My favorite is the extremely spooky 1st class pool and the prop box. Our guide did a great job and at some point, there were people turning on the lights on their phones, not because they were scared, of course, but just because it was too dark to see ;)",vnboyd
50,Fascinating!,"We enjoyed the historical tour of the Queen Mary, and the audio portion as well. (Why aren't these combined)? They also have a ghost tour we did not take, and a display of Princess Diana artifacts we didn't spend time on, having just traveled to London. The ship was so beautiful and we enjoyed exploring each area of this bygone era ship and spent more than a few hours here. Definitely a must see.",vjeric
50,Scary good!,Haunted or historical is the two tour choices. The historical tour might be a little better. Either choice will not disappoint. The ship is amazing and the tour is worth the price. Watch for all ghost during your tour. Its scary good!,Mic Loc
50,Somewhere In Time,"Awesome stay! If you get the chance stay on the Queen Mary. Beautiful staterooms, wonderful customer service and great fun! If you cannot stay, then go and take a tour (Princess Diana tour, Historic Tours or the Ghost tour) all awesome. Or maybe just have dinner, really great restaurants!",Arleemah
50,Enjoy the History,Great place to visit. Great history. There are many events and tours available so check their website for neat opportunities.,Stacy M
30,Okay,"Went to the Queen Mary to have lunch at the chowder house. Food was very good as was the service but very expensive. We did not take a paid tour but walked around a bit after we had eaten. It was interesting to look around but I think I'd have been disappointed to have paid money for a tour. If we hadn't had the kids with us, one of the evening ghost tours would have been a lot of fun though.",Jaymarti
50,Planned visit,"Brilliant tour we did self guided tour, there were different packages to do this suited us, it took about 4 hrs for us to follow the audio around, my only criticism would be you have to pay to park so that was an extra $18 on top of the ticket price! That said it was great to see such a vessel that holds so much history!!",karen123308
40,See a Bygone Era,"My wife (fiancée at the time) were checking out wedding venues and decided to pay a visit to the Queen Mary on a whim. While not the venue for us, we had a blast taking in the Art Deco decor and history of the golden age of ocean travel. Would be a fun place to spend an evening. Certainly a good way to kill a few hours.",GaribaldiCU
50,Ghost Tour was fun,Beautiful cruise ship! We went on the ghost tour and our tour guide was amazing! The ship has been wonderfully maintained and gives off a classic vibe. A definite must see if you are in the area. Just be prepared to spend quite a bit since parking is crazy expensive and the tour runs about $30 per person.,Acooper200611
50,Hail the Queen,Great ocean liner of a bygone era!!! Great old ship that has history of service on Trans-Atlantic routes and even acted as a troop transport during the war. Now floating museum and very interesting and luxurious piece of history. Great old photos and displays everywhere. Wood paneling and crystal chandeliers are magnificent. Each deck has new things to see and explore. Worth trip and is ez to get to from anywhere in LA.,Thomas P
30,"Fun for special events, and the food is ok","I've been here for the halloween event which is always fun and scary (though usually packed). I've also been here to dinner and to eat on the water is really nice, but the food could be better.",Kara L
30,Interesting historic ship,"Interesting piece of history in sunny Long Beach. The ship had several different tours to participate in, along with an excellent audio tour. The engine room was interesting and you could see the actual propeller in the water from one area on display. The model gallery shows cut away versions of many famous ships, including the Titanic. Several gift shops are available with souvenirs from all different price points.",GSLKTS
40,Big Beautiful Ship,The Queen Mary is big and beautiful and has so much history. The stories of the people who sailed on her are interesting and at the same time makes you wonder if they are still aboard? They keep the ship very clean and it is wonderful to just walk around and take in the surrounding views.,iamtariann
30,Nice to see but a bit disappointing,We were a bit disappointed. The ship needs quite a bit of TLC. Glad we visited and nice to hear some of the history but the owners really need to spend a bit of money on it. If they did it could be a really good place to visit or stay,489Mike
50,Interesting and Treat for History Buffs,"Visited the Queen Mary for an entire afternoon. The attraction is both a floating ""museum"" and a working hotel. The ship has a Wyndham hotel within it where you can stay over night for an on-board experience. For this reason, I think it is kind of confusing where to enter and in which areas you should walk around on deck. The short answer is feel comfortable walking around any area of ship that's not locked. Once you park, go directly to the middle of the ship to the external elevator and then go to 4th floor/ main deck. It is from here that you can check in for tours and ask questions of the attendants and shops clerks. There is a bar and couple of cafes for snacks. The ship is permanently docked no longer has an engine and there is a theatre and engineer room exhibit at the back of the ship that was a favorite for family and children. I enjoyed the history tour which pointed out rooms and furnishings that were original to the cruise ship and gave a nice background on the Queen Mary's usage in wartime. Would recommend a visit.",Toby-Likes-Travel
50,wonderful historic visit.,The Queen Mary is an elegant lady with lots of history. The areas open to the public were well kept and most had retained a lot of their original décor. The Observation Bar was great with a wonderful happy hour. We stayed two nights in one of their rooms which was nice to see how the ocean liners were for passenger rooms 80 years ago You felt like you had gone back in time.We took a couple of the tours which were great. We had the Breakfast Buffett which was not bad at all. We are glad we did it.,TravelinShaz
20,A pricey look at history decaying,"You pay a huge price for a tour but are only shown maybe 1/4 of the ship. You must pay for another tour to see other parts of the ship. The tours and pricing were confusing and the staff couldn't seem to explain it to us. We waited an hour for our tour to start never realizing we could have been wandering around seeing some areas that are open to stroll through and not on the tour. That info. plus a map would have helped a lot. We never even saw any restaurants. Maybe we would have eaten there if we knew where the restaurants were (but that would have been another huge expenses I'm sure).The place looked so tired and creepy. Not in a fun ghost tour way (we didn't go on the ghost tour) but in a sad and run down way. What a shame or should I say sham. Oh, and don't forget to bring money to pay for parking when you leave too!!!",scopeclan
50,A step back in time,"The Queen Mary is a simple ship compared to today's ocean cruise ships, but it gives a great look at another era. Great bar too.",Molly H
40,Fun Time,My fiance and I had a nice day here. We couldn't give it 5 stars because the tour was a little confusing and we felt like we were missing parts of the ship that would have been nice to see. We enjoyed the Haunted Encounters tour but wished it included more scary stories. We also felt that it was a little overpriced. Wear tennis shoes and comfy clothes as it is a long day with lots of walking. We would visit again.,MComley
40,Queen Mary visit,"Stayed the night and ate at bistro on the ship. It was fun to take tours and explore the ship, but our stay was quite expensive. Lots of taxes placed on our room before we even walked in. $50 in taxes and fees before our room charge which seemed excessive. Lunch was expensive with soup bowl $10, and house salad $13. Breakfast buffet was a good moderate choice. Overall it was a fun experience to do once and check it off our bucket list 😊",Patsy W

The man in the radio room entertained my brother in law who is a ham operator and enjoyed the conversation. Very friendly gentleman with lots of information.,Calgal39
50,A beautiful old lady of the sea,A real history lesson is what you get when you step on board Queen Mary. She must have been a vision of splendor when she was built but sadly showing her age now. The tour guides have a wealth information about the history of the ship and it's different duties over time including being used for transporting troops during WWII. Definitely worth a look.,Craig H
50,Traveled in time,"Traveled with my 16 year old daughter and her friend. We loved this attraction, we went on board for a late lunch and it was like time travelling. As soon as you stepped on board it was like another world, the staff are dressed to enhance the vision and it was purely amazing. My daughter and I share the love of old historical sites and this was no disappointment, I would have loved to go on one of their haunted tours or the princess museum but we were short on time and could not, maybe next time. The food was great, and a good excuse to get on board such an amazingly huge iconic ship.",Jessica499
30,Has Went Downhill Over the Years,"The owners have let this wonderful attraction go downhill as the year have passed. The ship needs a lot of work to bring it back to what it once was. I have heard of plans to refurbish it totally and hope that happens. It is still a fun place to stop and have a drink on a nice day. I have never stayed in the hotel portion, but hear the rooms are not all that great.",PatrickLongBeach
40,Stepping back in time,"We left a modern cruise liner and boarded the 'Mary' stepping way back in time ! This is a floating history lesson ! Comparisons between the then and now so all so obvious, decks and public spaces were extremely large (spaces filled by extra cabins on modern day cruise ships). We had a suite once used by Churchill (?) 2 baths, room enough for a football match ! Food we found was disappointing but OK. Had a 5 hour ghost tour.... will never forget that, our host was passionate about his pastime interest , his ship and his friends of the past. Very informative tours of a great ship with a remarkable history.",Ian B
50,Queen Mary haunted tour,"Very Good tourThe Haunted Encounters Tour is a daytime ticket that includes an introductory film, a fast-paced guided tour of many parts of the ocean liner that are haunted from the engine room to staterooms, with lots of subjective stories of ghost experiences on the ship and a special effects display in the first-class pool area. However we went when the effects of the tour where under construction… so we had a more authentic tour.. First our tour guide was awesome.. Very creepy all on his own. Very were informed, very eloquent. We had the opportunity to into the ship's haunted areas feel the resident psychic vive. For which we felt the tour went at a good pace and covered different areas of the ship than the daytime tour. Within minutes we felt the creepy feeling what someone is watching… Our pictures come out with orbs and distorted. Again if you want to get freaked out.. great tour.. Ask for Daniel.. ...",losjedis1

40,Huge piece of history,A chance to relive the history of our grandparents. Numerous permanent and temporary exhibits. Some places do show certain amount of wear but that is to be expected. Numerous reenactments on special days - probably the most reasonable to visit at those dates if you have the flexibility.If you are at all interested in mechanical stuff be sure to visit the engine area - entrance is from the other side,indreva

The self guided tour was confusing, the glory days tour was just a snippet of the boat history. The haunted tour was amazing/ showing the swimming pool, and sharing some ghost encounter stories. Beautiful views from outside the ship. Plan to spend a whole day here. The Passport bus stops right on the property.",AmieMo
40,tour an amazing old luxury liner,"I did the basic, non guided tour with non of the add-ons as it was an evening event for me. I was in town for business and this was walking distance from my hotel but appeared to be plenty of parking. This ship is visible from all over the waterfront and I have admired it from afar many times and was so glad I finally had the opportunity to get on-board. Part of it is a hotel, has a restaurant, bar, halls for proms and such ( prom going on the night I visited), but other than that you are free to wander the ship as you please. Has a model room showing the different luxury liners and cut aways of some of the famous ones like the titanic. I am a boat person and really enjoyed the tour and the views of long beach at night. Quite a bit of climbing stairs and walking, so may not be the best if you arent very mobile.",David J
40,lot of history,"We used our LA GO card to go aboard. We parked by the Aquarium($8) and rode a free shuttle over otherwise parking new the ship was @ 20.00. So see both eat at either and see if the shuttle is free. we are going on the QEII next year and wanted to see and learn about how Cunard treated its riders. It was eye opening how back then the classes were treated so differently. It also is a tour where James explained how once you come aboard you are family forever. The tour takes you through the ship and tells about it regal and wartime crossings. There are two places to eat on board, the whole tour including engine room is 2-3 hours easy.",tctommy
30,Good experiance for a couple of nights,It was great to experience the feel of the old ship.You need to remember it is an old ship and that you are experiencing the look and feel of that era. Rooms are smaller than modern hotels and the sound proofing is non-existent.Some of the staff did not offer the level of service I would have expected leaving us to find a lot out ourselves about the facilities.Great to see a bit of the past and the audio tour is good if you like to find the history of the vessel.,Stuart M
30,"Historical features, Musty rooms","We were anxious to stay in this historic vessel, and looked forward to a memorable adventure. However, when we arrived in our stateroom, it was musty, dingy, and tiny.Fortunately, we didn't have to spend much time inside our room. We explored the nooks and crannies of the ship, and enjoyed the decor and views on the decks. The architectural features were nostalgic and elegant.",Julie D

20,Smoke and Mirrors.,"We thought that it might be a little bit fun to stay in this little piece of history. A night on an ocean liner from the 1930's seemed to be a lovely idea. But, unfortunately the truth is a little bit different.From the outset, whilst parking the car, through to the actual room, the intention seems to be to part you from your hard earned cash.The whole point of the hotel is to give you that feeling of being on a luxury liner from that period in history. But the ship looks and feels like it has had no attention paid to it since then. It is looking old and tired and in desperate need of a refurbishment. From the rooms to the public areas, everything seems tired and uncared for. The carpets are worn, and the beautiful wood panelling has lost its shine.The family suite that we stayed in was clean, but the toilet decided that it would flush continually for about 40 minutes at a time. And the fixtures and fittings seem to be held together with sticky tape. The tv only seemed to get the weather channel. It was a slice of history, but a slice that hasn't been looked after.The tours were interesting, although the Diana exhibition wasn't so much about her as the royal family as a whole. Possibly more interesting.The ghost tour was interesting, less from the point of view of the ghosts and more from the point that we got to see areas of the ship that were normally closed. An example of this was the swimming pool. A beautiful structure deep in the bowels of the ship, displayed with low lighting, possibly to give the effect of the eeriness, but more likely to stop you seeing clearly that there had been no attempt to look after the pool since the ship was docked there.One other little bug bear was that half the tours were closed, including the rotting Russian submarine outside that seemed to need as much attention as the ship.Finally, a lot of the beautiful areas such as the Grand Ballroom are closed to even the hotel guests as they are set aside for functions alone. You we left to eat at the somewhat overpriced restaurants. The one we ate in was alright. Not even worth a review here. Neither bad nor good.All in all, we were quite disappointed by the whole experience. Everything seems to be trying to give the illusion of being on a liner of that era, without the class and luxury that the ship once had. A poor old lady that is slowly rotting away on the quayside. In desperate need of attention and being covered in layers of paint to cover up the decay. And displayed with smoke and mirrors to distract the attention from this.Worth a tour? Maybe. Worth the stay? No. I can tick this off the list, but very very disappointed.",andrewanddiane
40,This review is for the hotel,"The hotel is so charming with a lot of history, The rooms are small and outdated. They are just so dark, I feel a bit claustrophobic at times. I guess we are used to taking cruises and staying on suites with balconies. The bedding and decor is lackluster. They could use an update while still keeping with the asthetic of the ship. The staff here is very friendly and it's very fun to walk around the ship and explore. The staff in the restaurants are very friendly and prompt also. All in all, I would recommend this hotel as an overnight stay. BE WARNED: they get you with the parking fee's. Please do try the bar for live entertainment also on weekends.",Dollpower
40,Spooky,"2 adults 1-10 year old. My wife has been so eager to go due to the supernatural nature of the ship and away we went! We went on a Saturday morning, and since it was in January, the overcast and coolness of the weather added to the effect of the visitation of the ship. We arrived before noon, so there was still ample amount of parking and is secluded from other attractions in the area, which from what I saw there is a lot. Please allow 2-3 hours maybe more if you plan on visually inspecting the ship and its history, but also remember this is an active hotel and there are people staying at the location. There are headsets that coordinate with portions of the ship if you want a oral guide on your tour and I am pretty sure there also tour guides but I did not look into that. There are historical placards located throughout the ship and reading them takes you back into time when the ship was sailing through the ocean. If you have young children, they might get a little bored and tired with the walking, as our ten year old became a little exhausted, but there are places to sit, views to look out onto, and small snack bar offering coffee, fruit, chips, and goodies. There is a night tour, which we want to go back and do. There is also a Russian sub in the same water way but we did not tour that. We will definitely go back and do the night visit soon. Thank you for reading.",Danimal3474
40,"Off one cruise ship, then on to another!","We took a full guided tour of the Queen Mary. The tour guide was a bit ""different"" (perhaps a retired Marine Corps Sergeant), but he was very informative and entertaining.What I especially liked about the exhibit, was that you could walk virtually anywhere on the ship. We spend 2.5 hours just walking around and admiring ocean travel from a past time.The 4D theatre was OK, if you don't mind getting squirted with water a few times, but this was expected and was fun.Before we went back to the Hotel Maya by Doubletree, we had a drink each in the forward bar on the Promenade deck. I had a Gin and Tonic, and my partner had a rum and Coke. $22.00 USD!!! A bit steep, and the service was slow.Overall, I would recommend this attraction to anyone in the Long Beach area.",JetJock_YHZ

40,Fun getaway,"My mom and I came to stay the night for a girl's birthday celebration. We were quickly welcomed onto the ship at 11 a.m. and were immediately able to check into our room. For only $25, we got an upgraded view, as well as free parking because we booked on Groupon. In addition, we received two free tours as well as free tickets to the Diana exhibit. The room was clean, but not deep cleaned. While the bathroom is smaller than an average hotel, it was much bigger than the bathrooms on modern cruise ships. The room was long with plenty of storage space, wood paneling throughout, and a very comfortable bed. It really felt like you were stepping back in time 60 years. There are tons of things to stay busy all day without leaving the ship.",RoLayne A
40,Historic!,We didn't know what to expect other than it being a historic ship. The rooms are large in side compared to a modern cruise ship but small compared to a hotel. The toilets flush funny as they look like they're (along with other fixtures) the original ones. The bed was comfy and had a flat screen TV... Walls are super thin so you do hear your neighbors which was a bit odd. Parking was $20 per night which I think should have been included in the $15/day resort fee. Internet and self-guided tour are included in the resort fee.,Findley123104
10,HORRIBLE,"The Queen Mary wants your money, nothing else. For such a beautiful, historic ship, one would think this place would not be such a tourist trap. To do anything of substance on the ship, plan on paying an additional fee, on top of the entrance fee you already paid. Extremely overpriced. Food is tasteless.

10,Ghost tour - a real disappointment,Visited the Queen Mary on our recent trip to the area with our daughter. We went on the ghosts tour and was so disappointed. My husband and I did this tour 12 years ago where it was full of history and stories. It has changed and not for the better. Now it is an attraction that is trying to use small pieces of history for pure entertainment similar to a haunted house. Even at that it was poor. Host trying to make you jump and the second staff member was similar to a member of the Adam's family. Completely disappointed with this tour. This will be one of two reviews I write. The quality of each (this one poor) needed to be highlighted separately.,TravelCrew9801

His descriptive narrations made one feel that they were living back in the time when this ship was in its glory. They have done a nice job in maintaining this beautiful ship.

30,Great Ship/ Confusion,"First be advised that the parking is $18 but on line it says that if you visit one of the eateries and get it validated you get $10 off. This is only if you leave before 3 hours, I didn't know and had to pay $18. We bought a First Class ticket which came to about $52 which included the Submarine Scorpion tour. This tour is closed for renevations. Their are some 4 places to grab something to eat and drink. Only the Chelsea was open, the others were closed. I enjoyed the ship , touring on my own with my wife. We did the Haunting tour which lasts about a 1/2 hour and it was fun..",Charlie V
50,A Great Family Experience,"We finally took the time to see this fun attraction. While the ship itself lacked the historical luxurious decor for which it gained it's original fame, the videos and illustrations aboard the ship were informative and enjoyable. Children would especially appreciate the room which contains a Legos model of the ship. To see the ship without taking one of the show tours would be a huge mistake. We participated in ""Ghosts and Legends"", a 20 minute ghost tour that was great fun for kids, parents, and grand parents. I would love to experience it again, this time with my grand children.",Marlene M
30,A Fading Beauty,"We fortunately found a discount for tickets in a hotel magazine, so we paid a fair price. We chose the Glory Days tour and our tour guide was very interesting and informative. It would have been nice to have seen inside the rooms, and the pool in its original form. After our tour, we explored the upper decks. Unfortunately the ship needs some serious money and tlc, it's such a shame to see a once majestic ship in decline.",letspackupandgo
50,A Beautiful Ship - an Informative Tour,We took the day pass with a general tour. Ship is beautiful and so full of history. Would love to return and take the ghost tour. Did not time right to try any of the restaurants.,Debbie F
30,Interesting but overpriced,"Mildly disappointing. The ship itself was interesting to see, but the price and parking fees made this a poor value. Our tour guide was somewhat odd--probably more suited to giving the ghost tour. The staff was not very helpful and the directions were generally inadequate. The 4-D movie was different, but not great. I wish we could have seen more of the inside of the rooms.",wvbuckeye
30,"Fun to try once, bur bring ear plugs!","It is an iconic location right in Long Beach. We stayed there while we attended a convention. The rooms are nice but there is no consistency. One room may be fabulous art deco ""wow we are on a ship"" and the next one is a blah redone attempt at a modern remodel. Of course everyone wants the ""good"" rooms and the staff is skilled at feigning ignorance on the room types. HUGE TIP: bring ear plugs! There are vents on every door and the ship is VERY noisy! When we complained on the second day, they explained the ship's construction and offered us complimentary ear plugs. It would have been nice if they had mentioned that on check in. The location looks close, but one has to either drive to everything else in long beach or take the ""free"" shuttle which is not timed that well. All In all, it was fun to try once, but we would never stay there again.",George C
30,Took some friends there,I took some friends to the Queen Mary for a day of site seeing. I forgot how big the ship is and how old it is. If you have never been on the ship then go.,Marshall M
10,Skip This Skiff,"Like many another, I came to visit because I'd been on the ship when I was a kid. She was beautiful then. She is not now. Badly maintained, its like a floating fleabag hotel. One nice part is the Churchill Bar for an over priced drink. Speaking prices, the only way in is to book a tour, the tour prices are $30-35/head, slight discount for oldies and kids to 11. Cost us $90 for three people. For that money they could buy a bucket of paint and some Lemon Pledge. Skip this, keep your memories safe.",talkcineman
40,Historic stay,"My husband and I got engaged on the Queen Mary, spent our wedding night on the Queen Mary and it made perfect sense for us to come back for our 10th Anniversary. We booked a nice room with a king-sized bed and a lovely view if Long Beach, had an amazing dinner at Sir Winston's, used the nice little weight room, listened in on the various tour guides. It was great except for one thing - the metal walls. They transmit sound REALLY well. I woke up to the indepth discussion of what plan under Obama care the women in the next room were considering and they weren't speaking that loudly. My advice, take a white noise machine or earplugs so you can enjoy your sleep and don't say or anything that you don't want your neighbours to know about. And enjoy!",astorin
50,Sunday Brunch,"Went on an excellent guided tour here a cupple years ago, and revisited here Feb.7th, 2016 for their Sunday Champaign Brunch. The Grand Dining Room is Beautiful, the servers were VERY attentive of each tables needs, and the food was excellent!",tom_from_nm1969
50,Amazing memories,Went for Brunch last year and came back a few more times. Great service. Great food. Worth every penny,Rmanu67
30,Interesting step back in time,"The self-guided audio tour gave us all the information we needed, and we liked being able to set our own pace. The ship is in serious need of cosmetic repairs. It sadly looked shabby.",familyof4SoCal
50,must see,2016 sees the 80th Anniversary of this great ship the tour is $ 36 but well worth it as there is nothing to match the experience it is like going back to 1930s amazing a must see,frank f
30,Old Boat worth a look,We was waiting for our cruise to depart so we wondered around this old cruise liner which they have turned into a hotel and exhibit it was worth looking at if you have time to kill nice area too,reeceyb
40,Free Pass to See Her,"We cruised out of this port and were allowed free access to see the Queen Mary. We are history nerds and we really enjoyed the floating-museum! It was fun to compare it to our modern Carnival Cruise Line Ship! We stayed on board for a while, took lots of pictures and loved the view!",its5oclocksumwhere
30,'Historic' Stay!,"The Queen Mary is steeped in history. One can't argue with that and it's assuredly deserving of a wander/tour. I stayed here for three nights so I have some thoughts. For starters, it's a trek to get to and from anything else as it's across the bay. So you end up spending money on Uber/taxis or parking to go back and forth from Downtown LBC. Secondly, the rooms are somewhat small and the bathrooms have a funk to them. Understood, as it's a really old ship. The walls are quite thin as well. So if you're looking for 'luxury' then look elsewhere.HOWEVER, overall it's a really cool place to see and wander around and scope out the history behind the place. The Observation Bar is a nice place to grab a drink and look out over the bay as well, so I recommend that.All told, I'm glad I stayed there but I don't know if I'd stay there again but would definitely come back for one of their tours!",Tyskyr
40,Great experience,The ship was very interesting and shows a great view of Long Beach. Great tours including the haunted tour that goes way below deck. Only down side is I thought it was kinda pricy and they charge a different rate for each tour. Try to check a deal on Groupon!,Pamela B
30,Very cool to see,A great piece of history. A bit aged but that's why it's permanently docked.A good way to experience this method of travel without actually doing itWell done and reflects a significant part of history.,TAMAN1951
40,Enjoyed the Ship,"We recently took the self guided tour and really enjoyed it! We enjoy tours that involve a bit of history and a bit of walking around, so this was right up our alley.The self guided tour enabled us to set our own pace and check out things on our own.The give you a headset that you can stop and start as you choose we really enjoyed it.We enjoyed lunch in one of the restaurants..The Tea Room. And we both discussed what fun it would be to come back and spend a night on board and take another tour. Maybe one of the spookier evening tours.",Mark B
20,So sad and So EXPENSIVE,"Taking my elderly mother here was a complete waste of the $100 it cost. Yup! That's 2 tickets for our own self guided tour and the $18 for parking! Unbelievable! The place was pretty dead. A lot of the exhibits were gone or being ""redone"". There wasn't even a sample ""cabin"" to see. Quite a disappointment. Sorry I went. The Princess Di exhibit was mildly interesting.",XManNL
50,Mos review,"What an experience! I sailed on the queen Mary 53 years ago so for my 75th birthday, my daughter took me here--high tea and the whole experience. The ship is beautiful--the food excellent--our room exquisite with all the original fixtures, etc. the only negative was the noise at night. They have weddings Friday and Saturday night SO request to be away from the party. Noise",Maureen D
30,Overnight Stay,"We were returning from a 4 day Mexico and had such a great time, decided to extend with a night on The Queen Mary. We doubled the price of our room by getting a suite which was like sleeping in a museum. I thought I might have enjoyed it but it just left me feeling unsettled and didn't have a great night's sleep. Didn't hang around for breakfast.",John P
50,A NEAT WAY TO SPEND A WEEKEND,"My husband and I were in California on a business trip/anniversary celebration and I decided it would be a neat surprise to book a room on the Queen Mary. The price was good but the pictures of the room they showed were deceiving. The room was tiny and alot of the ship was needing repair work. It is such a lovely piece of history and the sight of rust and peeling paint was disappointing. Still, had a walk through the past while exploring the ship.",Dianne E
30,Huge disappointment in my eyes!,"Let me start by saying they charge $18 just to park in their lot which is outrageous!!! The admission is $36 per person to board the ship and wander around and that cost does not cover the Princess Diana exhibit either. The Queen Mary was dark, musty smelling, rusty, paint peeling and falling off the ceilings and walls and I thought she was depressing!! She had very long, wood paneled halls with bad lighting and no ventilation. I don't know what the hotel rooms looked like but, if they were like the rest of the ship, I would not pay to stay there. Unless you really want to see her, I cannot recommend spending that kind of money to visit. I was greatly disappointed.",dachydads
10,Overpriced and commercial,"This is a hotel and a wedding venue. There is a nice room with models of ships but it is really expensive to o buy a ticket. To me, not worth it.",Doglover3336
40,Worn ship with a lot of potential,"I'm sure this is mentioned in several reviews, but the wonderful Queen Mary is worn down and can use some repairs. I never stayed in the hotel but made a visit to walk the ship, see the Princess Diana exhibit, and take the ghost attraction.It was a good feeling being on a ship so old and getting a feel of the once amazing Queen Mary. There is not much to do but the ghost attractions. That was fun (Depending on the people in your group) with a mix of cheesy props and yet the interior of an old ship rusting away. Was not expecting to explore the bottom of the ship. It is dark and can get fast at times when the tour guide runs off and expect you to follow. I give the review an average rating just because the expectations will wear off quickly as you find yourself waiting for your attraction time with nothing to do but take photos of the Carnival cruise ship parked next door. However, if you are a history geek like me, this must be on the bucket list.",moking89
30,Good thing to do before you go to airport to embark on your red eye,It was good. Ship was a little run down. Great for history buffs. Had an amazing Princess Diana exhibit.,ungemcat
40,Nostalgic old ship,"Well worn but lots of class for the ship itself. However, I was given so much misinformation by different employees I was very frustrated and they really didn't seem to care. Best thing was the paranormal night tour. It's worth staying on the ship just for that",Jetskijo
40,Stay at home cruise,"As mentioned in my review is Sir Winston's, we stayed on the Queen Mary for an event. It is truly an experience that cannot be duplicated because of the ship itself. Wonderfully preserved and run by Wyndom, you could be on an Atlantic crossing with movie stars of yesteryear. Rooms a spacious and retain all of the deco charm from when she was built",mfp21
40,Entertaining History,I finally came here last year to see the Diana Exhibit and decided to check out the rest of The Queen Mary as well. I wish I had more time to look around and read all of the details that were provided in the captions but the crowd I was with had limited patience. There is so much history to read about and you would need a few hours to read it all but my favorite part was going down to the boiler room at the bottom and wandering through that maze-like section. You get to see all of the components that go in to getting a boat of that size to move along in the ocean and it's really impressive when you consider when it was made. I would go to check it out again. Side note: There is a fee for parking so be prepared to pay for that.,Tamara V
50,Trip Back In Time!,"This was an amazing afternoon, honestly felt like we were living in history! The ship is so well preserved, lovely and quiet, got lost and honestly could feel the ghosts around us. Such a unique experience, would recommend it highly!",AngLanePhil
50,Historic,"Want the boat all to yourself? Go in the middle of the day in the middle of the week. The place is empty, which means the service is terrific. Buy $10 worth of food to have parking reduced by $10.",LV_Lee
40,Historical MUST SEE!,"The Queen Mary really is a must see for any visitor from around the world and any visitor from the USA. The history of this ship is amazing. Yes it is a bit expensive to buy a ticket But - you will not be disappointed if you're a history buff.If you take the time to read all of the display notes and see all of the pictures and artifacts it really is a wonderful tour. The ship has been used to carry people from Europe to the USA; as a military ship during WWII and now as a tourist site.Also if you saw the movie Titanic, the Queen Mary will give you a very good idea about how it must have been to sink such a massive ship.From an architectural standpoint the ship is gorgeous - to see how the wealthy dined, danced and enjoyed the ship is so interesting.I think the shoppes on board are just ok - they could be improved.Food options are also just ok.Staying on board is a blast. The rooms are unique and original. We stayed in a family room and it was so interesting to see how the room was built - beautiful wood and the ship doors, windows, sinks are all original. The tub has a fixture that lists salt water as one option. Of course now that is not available but it's fun to think about it.See the Queen Mary when in Long Beach! One of my Must See points of interest in Long Beach.",Tatabooboobax
40,Historic but pricey,"My family loved exploring the ship. It is very well maintained and a site to see. However, you have to not only pay for parking, but if you want access to certain locations (all of the good spots) you have to book a tour. They have evening tours, haunted tours, and you can even book a hotel room on the ship! There are a couple of spots to grab a bite to eat and a drink on board. Just be prepared to pay.",6Liddells
50,5* attraction 3* breakfast,"5* as an attraction3* as a breakfastLike that nice old lady from the story books.. She may have lost her wealth, youth and popularity, but she has not and will not lose class and grace, and more than makes up for it in legend. Not many ships can tell such stories, especially ones you can actually walk into today with a stroller and have breakfast in!What I enjoyed the most is the authenticity of the experience just walking into the ship, the woodwork, the decor, even the furnishings.. Just like stepping into another era that we had only heard of.. They had posters all around telling you about the history of the ship, fascinating stuff.. I really felt like a child being taken to a cool museum. It is LONGER than the height of the Eiffel Tower, and twice the height of the great pyramid of Giza and Washington monument! It is HIGHER than the height of niagra falls.. WHATT!!?Getting there was tough, parking is extortionate, we were lucky we took an Uber cool transport service, thus avoiding parking.. Also because we were having breakfast we didn't need to pay the entrance fee, but missed out on the tours..The breakfast was a 3* at best, but it was nice of them to make you fresh eggs on request, and our waiter Lupe was such a nice guy and gave us 5* service (& caused no fiasco).. The view was breathtaking, and a walk on the deck is all it takes to make this a lifetime memory. Wether you choose the breakfast or the tour, it is well worth the visit.Such a shame these legendary sites can't seem to upkeep fitting standards to match their magnificence, does it really have to be one or the other!? One wonders how long she can stay afloat by relying mainly on her past..",Mamdoh B
30,Buffet breakfast- average,"Popped here for breakfast, bit underwhelming to be honest. Not a huge choice on the buffet. Coffee ok, waffle machine fun. Lots of flies around the whole ship.",Dinah B

50,Fun day trip - especially when weather is nice,"I always love visiting the Queen Mary. Totally amazed at some of the rooms (hospital, barber, etc.) that were on board back in the day - and SO small, not sure how people fit in some areas. Lovely nostalgia - clothing, table settings, wood and brass work. I've never eaten on board but there are several restaurants - you can walk around yourself or take a tour. Tours are always great because you learn a lot more than you do just venturing on your own.",Leslie
20,"Overpriced, run down, and expensive.","Very convenient to the Port if you're taking a Carnival Cruise but $350 for one night? You can get a whole cruise for that! The rooms are old, dated, and the beds are hard. Our hair dryer actually spit fire at my hair! The food in the restaurant was terrible and the service was worse. You can take a self-guided tour if you're staying there, but if you've seen it once, you're really just staying there for convenience after that.",Sandie M
50,Great afternoon,This is the ship that carried my father to the USA so I've wanted to visit for many years. The boat is well maintained and easily toured. The history and excitement of the time when the high seas were regal come alive. Well worth a visit. The included submarine visit is an excellent visit as well.,Gl0bal_guru
50,Amazing,"The ship is amazing, a tour or self exploration will reveal much spirit from the Queen.It's beyond words, something you have to experience to understand, it's a feeling when you are there.... and I am not a touchy feely type, but there is something moving aboard the Queen Mary.",Bree B
50,Interesting Tour,"We got a combo ticket from the Aquarium as we really wanted to do both attractions.Whilst it was quite pricey for the Queen Mary add on we felt after visiting it was actually good value. It was a really enjoyable self tour with the audio guide as we strolled across the decks to places we didn't think we would get it see.Also included was the choice of a history tour, ghost tour, world war tour and a few others which are at specific times. We decided not to take the guided tour option as we were pretty tired even with this felt the ticket price offered value for money.",BusTravBHD
50,The Gilded Age of Ocean Travel,"I you ever wondered how ""the other half"" lived (read royalty, movie stars and celebrities), a day aboard the Queen Mary takes you back to the mid-1930's. You can see the glamour, because although the original furnishings are gone, the sumptuous wood paneling, frescos, ceilings. fireplaces and art deco details remain. I was planning to also visit the Aquarium of the Pacific, but got so caught up in ""feeling"" the history of this great ocean liner, I spent six hours on board. After the intriguing one hour overview tour, I wandered at my own pace, had a drink in the cocktail lounge reserved for first class passengers, strolled the enclosed promenade and visited every permitted cranny of the ship. A bite of lunch and then a couple hours touring the extensive exhibit of the Royal Family and Princess Diana (including some of her clothing). If you have the time, a day ""aboard"" is a great ""trip.""",chestnuthouse
50,The Queen always impresses...,My first trip to the Queen Mary was in 1974. I was impressed then and I am still impressed today. Love to take our friends and family to experience her splendor and ambiance.,smiles57
50,Great historical fun!,"My 8 year old son and I went to the Queen Mary, his first time and my umpteenth time. Parking was a breeze, zipped right in! When we first boarded the ship we went straight up to the tour office to get our timing right. After that we freely walked around seeing the many sites. We really enjoyed the Lego replica of the Queen Mary!! Stopped for Starbucks, me an ices coffee and him a yummy hot chocolate! Plenty of time to use one of the many clean bathrooms before our Haunted Tour. Our docent was very nice and informative. Our tour was scary and we had eerie feelings through the tour. Our pictures show a person behind us which wasn't there. So creepy! We lived our souvenir photo book, I think worth the $30! Planning our next trip to do the Ghosts and Legends Tour!!",lisa c
50,Queen Mary calisthenics,"Countless times I have flown over the Queen Mary, a beautiful ship sitting in the harbor at Long Beach. Her commanding lines and eloquent beauty are profound as you cross the bridge to the port.This truly is as close to walking on the deck of the RMS Titanic that you can ever achieve. The beauty of her covered decks hold many stories through the years she served with pristine honor. One could only imagine the love stories, the excitement of a 4 day journey across the Atlantic and arriving into New York Harbor, or the fear that nearly 780,000 young men felt as they steamed east to go fight in Europe.No sub could catch her ( except for the movie assault the queen ) during World War Two.If I had a time machine I would go back and take cruises on many of these famous liners, just to enjoy what travel truly was in the old days.I've included a bunch of Photos from the iPhone and encourage you to take a few hours to walk her decks if you ever visit Long Beach.Semper Fi Mitchell",TacoBelljr
40,Like a time travel,Visiting the Queen Mary is like going back some years and see how a trip like this looked 80 years ago. The boat is huge with several floors and amazing stuff to see. The radio station still works. If possible try to chat a bit with the Captain. Some interesting recent histories to hear.,Marcelo
20,Way overpriced,"How disappointing! All we wanted to do was wander around on the decks on our own, alas, we were told that even the least expensive admission includes one guided tour and one movie. A movie, mind you that had nothing to do with the history of the ship.. one of the choices was Spongebob Squarepants. Weird! So our least expensive option was a ticket which cost $29 per person. Ouch. Since we already paid for it we went ahead and took the tour, there was a choice of two tours, the history tour or the ghost tour. We chose the history tour. Our tour guide, who called himself ""Captain James"", seemed to know his stuff but his presentation was very annoying, he told his stories as if trying to impress a bunch of kindergarteners. There are a few exhibits which can be explored on one's own but they were not great, for example, the World War II exhibit only consisted of a few pictures on the wall. The posted walking tour was not well sign posted at all and there was no guide book available for purchase. The bathrooms on board smelled as if they had been cleaned with the same dirty rag since the heyday of the ship. Oh, the privilege of parking the car in the only available parking lot cost another $18. Eighteen dollars!! So, between the admission and the parking, that's just about $80 for two people, and in this reviewer's opinion, a total waste of money.",justtourists

He made everything more interesting because of his humor and gift for engaging his audience!

30,A paranormal enthusiast's dream!,"The ship is filled with pieces of interesting history and plaques showing various ghost sightings. For fans of the paranormal, this ship is a dream!We did the self-guided audio tour to learn more about the various areas around the ship and found the tour to be confusing and not overly interesting. We also booked the Haunted Encounters tour. The tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable but we felt he spent too much time talking about irrelevant stories. It would have been nice to see more areas of the ship during this tour and hear stories about these other areas. The Haunted Encounters tour did take us into some restricted areas including the inside of the bow of the ship as well as the first class pool area which has not been used since 1967. Overall the ship is pretty creepy and filled with many accounts of ghost encounters.The following day, we purchased tickers to the Princess Diana Exhibit. There is a decent collection of royal history in this exhibit but we felt it wasn't overly interesting the way it was laid out and presented. I would not recommend this exhibit.",dancinggeek
30,Disappointing,"Nautical history is an interest and we have wanted to see the Queen Mary since we sailed on its more recent namesake 10 years ago. I have to say the wait was't worth it. Much of the ship is fairly dilapidated. It is a bit like the hotel in Disney World's Tower of Terror. Oddly the most impressive room on the ship isn't on the audio tour. We snooped around and finally found the first class dining room, which is an Art Deco marvel. We took the ghost tour, a bit silly, but affords a chance to see one of the huge boiler rooms at the bottom of the ship. I like ships and in the end am glad l went but the tour could have been a lot better.",phillyshrink

He was so polished, yet approachable and full of facts and trivia while we took our tour. He took us to private areas and even to see a hotel cabin on the ship. The art, light fixtures and wood carvings on the ship are absolutely breathtaking and not to be missed. Be sure and do the entire tour which includes the bridge, engine room and submerged rudder.We were lucky that the Princess Diana exhibit was there, the dresses and items on display were gorgeous.We had lunch at the Chelsea Chowder House and Bar.

50,Queen Mary dinning is no gimmic !,"We had dinner at QM. At first I thought it was a tourist trap. Much to my surprise it was excellent. I had surf and turf. One of the best and I came after eating at various noted eateries. My rating is strictly for the food.Now the rest of the stuff I give grades that range between F and C-.The place is a fire hazard. We walked into dead ends several times after an 8pm dinner. No signs to guide you; hit and miss situation. There was one person at one of the many doors who pointed the direction toward some distance away, but nothing nothing else. We had to try several doors before one opened. On the way out, it was worse. It is dangerous. We spent half an hour to get out that is after asking 3 different people, also visitors. One also as confused and eventually followed us down to get to the parking lot. Lack of signage is no excuse. The parking lot is huge and wisely I didn't drive. Took a taxi and the driver knew to deposit us at the entrance. Had I gone there on my own I wouldn't know where the entrance is. The bellmen is the most unfriendly folks around. They get D-. The other services is barely passable at C-Would I return for another meal? No. The hazards outweigh the good food.

We do suggest buying your tickets on line, and printing the 2 page ship map.My father crossed the Atlantic on his way to Europe during WWII.

We found this out while trying to enter. They sent us back all the way across the lot to get the QM ticket. Only 2 windows open. My wife was in line for 20 minutes and hardly moved. I happened to corral a manager leaving the booth, and upon complaining strongly, he went back in and got me a ticket. This is the most ridiculous ticketing/re-ticketing process I have ever seen. Several folks were upset. Be advised.",dinerdon
20,DINING WITH THE SPIRITS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"We had been thinking about doing this for some time so we were excited to finally make the 'leap' and sign up. The timings all sounded reasonable(2 hr supper and 2 hr tour) so we were looking forward to an evening of fine dining and ghostly experiences. I'll put my food comments under Sir Winston's, but the executive summary: food was over salted, steak was tough and the apple pie dessert,?we had to ask for a knife to get through it. Ungood!We were delayed for our seating for supper but finished the meal early. The bad news was we then had to wait 45 minutes so the non-dining tour participants could join us. Not only did that extend the evening beyond reasonableness (is that a word?), but it made the group so big that if you got near the back, the tour was a complete bust as you could not see or hear our guide.Our tour guide was personable, engaging and a lot of fun. He had many stories of paranormal activity and some great anecdotes about the ship's history. I enjoyed most of the event although I did feel it was a 1 1/2 hour tour crammed into what was about 3 hours. If the extra time had been action packed ghostly revelations, that would have been fine; regrettably much of the extra time was a result of 'herding' the large group through the tiny corridors.Teeny tiny point of contention. We were told we were going to walk about 3-4 miles during the tour. Given that the ship is just over 1000 ft long (.19 miles) and 12 decks, we would have had to have walked the ship front to back about 8-10 times going from top to bottom several more. Sounds good but it is indeed a stretch. Maybe, just maybe a mile(and that's counting the hike in from the parking lot!)We understand the need to turn a profit, but the substandard meal, long, unnecessary wait after supper for more 'revenue' participants and the large, semi-unwieldy group, really detracted. All resulting in a less than positive experience that we would not recommend to others unless they had just won the PowerBall and had cash to burn.",SenorGancho
50,Good Tour,"This was an interesting tour, well conducted with knowledgeable guides. It was time well spent to learn the history of this beautiful ship, and to envision people embarking on an adventure on this elegant ocean liner.",EIIen
50,Haunted History,"This was my second visit to the Queen Mary, this time with my 18 year old daughter. We did the haunted tour (not the one with the flashing lights and screaming, but the history tour) and LOVED IT. Our tour guide was great, and I loved hearing all the back stories.",Kris R
40,The Ship is Grand,"The ship is a throw back to the past. The areas are beautiful but I think there should be an exemption for having to use the fluorescent lightbulbs. Great Art Deco is ruined by them. The observation deck bar is a great place to watch the harbor. When we left, we asked a porter for a cab and he called probably the OLDEST private sedan in town to take us to the World Cruise Port. The car was filthy and smelly. The porter should be ashamed. I would rather a yellow cab! I wouldn't suggest staying there but I would definitely visit. Hotel walls are very thin as many reviews state. The rooms are big but the bathroom was in rough shape. Loose tiles on the floors and lots of caulk that needs to be replaced and redone.",Bintheloop
40,Interesting Historic Tour,Our group of 6 enjoyed the 1 hour tour of the Queen Mary on 1/3/16. This is an informative introduction to the Queen Mary not only as luxury ocean liner but also her important military troop transport role during WWII. Much of the ship is in it's original form so be sure to bring a camera for great photo ops. This is a walking tour and portions of it do require stair climbing. My only issue is that there were many interruptions during narrations as it is also a hotel and guests roam freely about without regard to the tour. Overall a good experience.,Joe Albanese
50,Tea Room visit,"We love having Tea so much at the Tea House, we even had our Daughter's Birthday party here. They were so accommodating :) Super friendly staff ...",Lumadonajp
20,well past her prime,We drove down from Glendale to have lunch in the tea room. We had a reservation. We sat around almost a half hour because our server hadn't arrived. Then we left. Just as well. Dumpy and expensive.,lchicagolaw
50,We Found The Queen Mary by accident!,"We took a ride to Long Beach today just to see what there was to do! We saw the signs for Cruise Ship Terminal and Queen Mary!! So we went, we found the ticket booth got some tickets and explored this awesome cruise liner from back in the day! We also got to see the Princess Diana exhibit which was done really well! Glad we found Queen Mary!",Bridgeporter
50,take the haunted tour,You can walk around for free. You can have a drink at the bar. I recommend taking a tour. We took the haunted tour because we wanted to see the pool. Very worth while,michael m m
40,We thought we'd finish in two hours!,"Plan on four to five hours to do justice to this museum. We went for the Princess Diana exhibit, which turned out to be disappointing. The emphasis was more on the royals, and less on Di.Be that as it may, the tour of the Queen Mary was really interesting. We skipped the guided tour, and took the audio tour. It was interesting to see the ""golden age"" of ocean travel - ""Downton Abbey"" fans will really be interested in this tour.",Mike D
30,seen better days,"Such an exciting experience when I went as a child, now as an adult the poor Queen is slipping into disrepair. I hope that they can keep her up to her regal standards. It's a nice outing now but she needs some love.",hortonms
30,Cool to see old ship,"The Queen Mary has seen better days, but its still exciting to see all the pics of stars and the look at all the Cunard line models of ships. In its hey day this was THE boat to be on. Our room was cozy and we slept great.",TexasTransplant888
50,A Visit to the Elegance of Ship Travel long ago,"Having sailed on a couple of the ""Queens"", I was anxious to visit one of the most famous now made into a floating hotel, restaurant, sightseeing attraction. We visited there in early December when they had their ""Chill"" exhibit, a fun place for families with rides, outdoor attractions and an ice sculpture story of the Christmas Carol where you were provided parkas to withstand the 9 degree temperature as you walked around the ice story. The Queen itself had a wonderful exhibit on Princess Di's dresses but more importantly an extensive collection of memorabilia of the royal family dating back to the beginning of the 20th Century. I could have spent hours there. We had a light lunch in one of the restaurants, saw a 3 D movie of an abridged Polar Express with effects - very cute. We did not take a formal tour with guide as we did not have time but everyone seemed to enjoy the tales as they were taken around.",markarnar
50,Most popular in Long Beach,The history about the Queen Mary is really interesting. Specially with the rumor to be a hunted place.,Emily H
30,Queen Mary,Historic ship was that set for the scrapyard. Long Beach bought it and is advertised as a place to go. Hotel rooms are available by the Wyndham. Price is fair for walking around. Real glad I did not buy the 100$ package for New Years Eve. Overall experience was okay. The Queen Mary needs much more renovation. The boat needs more lights. The overall look of the ship was unclean. Just a thought but they could have actors playing famous clients and showing the boat during it's heyday. We are in Hollywood the land of stars and starlets. Did not feel like it was being utilized to it's full potential.,Terryan1
40,Worth a visit,"We had the pleasure of staying overnight two nights. This review is in regard to the Queen Mary portion not our stay.During our time on the Queen Mary we took the Ghosts and Legends tour which gives you history besides the stories of the ghosts. Sandy our tour guide was entertaining and made it fun. While aboard the ship we also took the Glory Days tour. James our tour guide was a hoot and made the tour entertaining. Some of the info was repeated in both tours. There is also an audio tour which we did not do and regret.The Queen Mary has so much history to it that the tours barely cover it. In the 48 hours we were aboard I felt we just skimmed the surface of the Queen Mary's secrets. Would love to have spent more time on the ship as it is a fascinating piece of history.At first our boys(12,9 8) were a bit hesitant but I think overall they enjoyed their time on the Queen Mary.",rwheeler
50,Mystery Ship & Ghost Stories!,"The Queen Mary is a very interesting ship, full of history, mystery and stories. You can rent a room on the Queen Mary. It has a couple of restaurants and bar aboard the ship. There is also ghost tours. The Queen Mary held many events such as the Dark Harbor on Halloween full of scary mazes and ghosts. There are also other conventions, New Years Eve dining and many more activities aboard this history rich ship.",soko y

40,Cool old Ship,The last time I went was for a party at night and it was fun to wander around the decks and look at the city at night. I would like to do a ghost tour someday. I have done the haunted shipwreck a few times and loved it.,Moxie_Grrl
40,Touring the Queen Mary,Our guide was most helpful and interesting. The information he shared was helpful in appreciating the full scope of the ship.,Gracy K
50,God save the QUEEN.,"My wife and I spent 3 nights on this NOBLE ship during the end of December 2015. We found the experience more than wonderful!! It took a comfortable day to just learn the history of the ship. If you are staying on the ship then the history tours are included. It was like sailing inside a history book. The rooms were comfortable but still decorated to be from the 1930's. Clean but old (but that added to the experience). We found that the food on the ship was also very good, but could also be pricey depending on taste. Parking was on site and upon check in you are given a pass card to use for using the lot at no charge. The valet service was WONDERFUL. Very helpful. The entire staff was A+++.The location of the ship is perfect for visits to the Long Beach area. There is a shuttle bus (that is FREE) for service to everything Long Beach has to offer.This was a wonderful stop if you want to get away from the typical Disney experience of LA.",Alan M
30,A sad experience,The ship is more of a 3rd class hotel and conference center than the ocean liner experience. Areas were closed off so we did not see the dining and ballroom facilities and/or staterooms and cabins used by the different classes of its glory years. The best part was the audio tour. But the ship is (understandably) in very sad shape. Go early to avoid crowds and make the most of the experience.,19Markham
30,Rather disappointing and not worth the price.,"Four of us were spending a couple of days in Los Angeles and were looking for usomething touristy to do. We came across an ad for tours of the Queen Mary and decided to take the tour. While we appreciated the history of the ship, we had expected more grandeur -- more the likes of Titanic. Alas, no crystal chandeliers, shiny brass railings or Art Deco light fixtures. Very little artwork or other decorative features. Instead we found a dated, rather drab old ship. The tour guide could have made up for these lacks with juicy stories about things that happened on the ship, what celebrities did on the ship, behind the scenes stories, etc., but, other than a superficial description and history of the ship and mentioning the names of a few celebrities who have stayed on the ship, our tour guide thought we would be interested in hearing what other tourists have said or done while taking a tour of the ship. (Really? Who cares?) We were also disappointed that more of the ship was not made available to us on the tour. We never saw a stateroom, the engine room, the kitchen. In short, we were disappointed and felt that the tour was not worth the $25 admission. The most interesting thing we saw were the hand-crafted, cross-sectioned models of various cruise ships.",ADBinNJ
40,Beautiful Ship,"Group of 8 family members did the Ghost Dinner and tour. It was a 2 hour dinner followed by a 2 hour Ghost tour. The dinner began at 7:00 and we were all very pleased with the food and service. Unfortunately after finishing the meal at 8:30, we had to wait until 9:30 for the tour to start, at which point others, that had not attended the dinner, joined the group. There was some repetition, in that we had talked with the tour guide over our meal, but heard the some of the same info later during the tour. It was great seeing the interior of the ship and hearing about it's history. The tour was drawn out longer than we would have liked, too much time was spent standing in one place at each ghost sighting location while the tour guide talked. Hard to just stand around after a big meal at 10:00 - 11:00 p.m. May be better to eat dinner on the boat on your own, then just do the ghost tour or another tour separately.",Nancy O
50,"A wee bit of the old days, but in great fun for the night or weekend!","Makes a great day trip, but I like to spend the night on board. Rooms are nice, service is good, shopping and entertainment are awesome! Enjoy a night in the old days!!",PeterLorenzo
50,Tour & Breakfast,"The tour was terrific, given by the captain. A lot of interesting facts & gave us so much info regarding life in the times of its heyday.That it was a soldier transport ship was intriguingly interesting.The food wasn't very good--eggs cold & runny, bacon greasy & coffee cold. Buffet line was long--should have had a setup with lines on both sides.It was NY Eve day & I'm sure they had a lot of evening prep. Over scheduling bus trips can work at times..but this wasn't the day to do it.I will not have a good memory of this tour.",Chocoholicjr
30,British icon abroad,This beautiful ship has been saved but sadly starting to show her age. Whilst most of the exhibits are a little worn ( a reflection of the age) the ship tour right down to the propellers is most interesting and enjoyable. Definitely worth a visit .,Woody838

30,Reduced price if you dine in ship,"Visited the ship on Sunday and booked a table for the champagne brunch. Mentioned this when we were purchasing our ""Royal Passport"" which gave us both the tour of the ship and the Princess Diana exhibition and found out that we received a discount rate on entry and only paid a reduced price for the Princess Diana exhibition. This info is not published anywhere - so make sure you take advantage of it.",2AussieGirls
50,Step back in time,"Staying in a deluxe ocean view room , great to look out at night & see the lights of long beach . There is so much to see on the boat , you could spend hours walking around reading about the past of the boat . Heaps of food places to eat or jump on the free bus to long beach .",SJDW2011
50,Best Accomodations Ever!,"My husband and I could not love this place more! We have stayed in close to a hundred different hotels in our lifetime so far and this was the most unique place to stay. Our room was luxurious with two portholes, a king bed, a large bathtub and plenty of space. The decor was incredible.We booked online through a discount website. Had we booked through the Queen Mary site we would have paid at least $20 more. Our room rate was about $60 plus a $15 facility fee which includes a free audio tour, then an additional $20 for parking. We paid less than $100 for one nights accommodation on this historic ocean liner. We thought this was a steal!We were like two kids in a candy store wandering the ship freely for 3.5 hours with our audio tour guide and enjoying all the museum exhibits. It was a blast to the past. We loved every minute of it and wanted more. Best of all, we basically had the whole ship to ourselves! It was evening in the low season and we saw only a handful of other guests wandering the ship. 80% of the time, it was just the two of us and it was romantic. We will visit again to relive these wonderful memories we made.Thank you Queen Mary.",Chris
30,Still Pretty Neat,"Visiting the Queen Mary as a kid was a bit more exciting, but then, what isn't? Even though the ship has undergone endless remodels and (sadly) modernizations for comfort and tourist interest, it's still a pretty cool piece of history. To this day I get a little freaked out knowing I'm quite a few feet underwater while in certain spots of the ship which adds to the fun of taking the tours.",KamranNezami
50,"Great History, Fun for Everyone","We've always wanted to visit the Queen Mary, it was my daughters birthday, and this is what she wanted to do. We did the Haunted Encounters tour, the Ghosts and Legends tour, and the Paranormal Investigation tour. All tours were fantastic, the guides for the day time tours were outstanding, and Matt was a great host for the paranormal tour at night. I could go on and on, but I would highly recommend these tours. The prices are great, plus, once you are on the boat you can do a self guided tour and get the headphones and explore the boat on your own.",Jeffrey_03

50,A fine place to visit for the holidays,"Visited the Queen Mary during the Christmas holiday season. Enjoyed the numerous trees, heard music and singing of Christmas Carols. It may have been associated with a wedding that was in progress but it was very festive. The decorations were especially nice. The historical movie is also quite interesting and has various segments that seem to have interest for different focus areas.",Tim_the_Enchanter417

40,"Lovely bit of history, restaurant mediocre, service average","As a frequent cruiser, I was fascinated by this historic ship. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas. We had dinner at Chelsea's Chowder House. The food was just okay, and we were disappointed that many of the items that appear on the online menu were not available. Waiter was friendly but not particularly attentive. After dinner, getting a taxi took a long time, and there seemed to be no system - one of the inside personnel called for the taxi but when it drove up, anyone standing outside could have hailed it. I'm glad to have visited the ship but probably wouldn't go again, certainly not to Chelsea's.",debshinder

The retired Queen Mary has many surprises for the stout of hart, no scary d'cats should attend!

Better yet, book yourself overnight to fully enjoy the squeaks and groans during your stay. Book months in advance for this exciting opportunity!",Jackie K

40,The Haunted Queen,"We bring our friends here to experience the history of the Queen Mary and they are also excited to know about the ghosts on the Queen. We actually paid for the haunted tour, which took us to the most popular paranormal sightings, which included the swimming pool. However, Hollywood, with its fancy lights, sound effects and smoke made the attraction seem like a side show carnival. It took away from the history and disrespected any ghosts that might be lingering. We had cocktails at the bar and walked around the ship which was beautiful. All in all it was a good time.",JuanitaB0nita
10,What happened to sightseeing???,"Why is EVERYTHING A tourist trap? While visiting San Diego I thought it would be cool to visit, quote, ""1 of the most haunted places in America"". The drive was 2 hours, roughly, in crazy California traffic. Reading online, I believe the cost was approximately $25 bucks a person. Steep but I thought FINE, get some ghostly pics and get off the boat. The entire drive, the thought of paying $50 bucks to take some pics plagued me until I pulled in and saw parking was $20. No way.......It's too bad that it costs $70 bucks to take a few pics in an American landmark.",Shane S
30,Cruise without leaving port!,"A great boutique hotel! I've done a modern cruise, and it makes you appreciate how luxurious the Queen Mary really was! Wood everywhere, and generously-sized rooms for shipboard accommodation. We had two sinks, one in the bathroom and one in the hall. Rooms are well appointed, with flat-screen TV. Tub and shower larger than some hotels. The vintage toilet took a little getting used to, as you have to hold the lever until it finishes flushing. Bed was quite comfortable, and it it felt decadent to order breakfast in bed from room service, one morning we were there. (Please note that you must leave room service trays in the hall when through. The maids who straighten your room do not take the trays and dishes away.) The hotel service desk is either understaffed or sometimes not manned, so be warned. We tried calling after 10 to ask about ear plugs and no one answered.About those ear plugs... We didn't have a problem with noise from other rooms on the ship or folks in the hall. No, the issue was the OVERWHELMINGLY LOUD MUSIC from the ""Chill"" attraction and ""Victorian Village"" on the dockside. The dome was apparently set up with ice sculptures with attached attractions and rides, and there was INTOLERABLY LOUD MUSIC UNTIL MIDNIGHT on Friday. If you were out on the deck, you could feel it in your bones, and could barely hear yourself talk. Being inside with the porthole closed muffled it somewhat, but it was still pretty loud. Saturday mercifully stopped at 10 pm. I understand that Friday was some sort of private party at ""Chill"" that had no consideration for people who might be trying to sleep or relax. I can only hope the Queen does something about their noisy neighbors. Don't they have noise ordnances at the Port of Long Beach? Guess not.The ship is magnificent, and we enjoyed both the ""Glory Days"" historical tour and the Princess Di exhibit. The Princess Di exhibit actually starts with Queen Mary herself, and goes all the way to Kate and William, and gives a great overview of the whole Royal family, with lots of commemorative items, personal items, newspapers, etc. Wallace Simpson has a whole room, including her lingerie! Kate Middleton's iconic blue dress is here! Even some of Princess Grace of Monaco's dresses are here. My husband enjoyed the exhibit as well, as there was a lot of historical material on the Windsors, not just Princess Di things. We did not do any ghost stuff; ghosts are overdone and hokey.The restaurants are great, and the staff attentive at all of them. Yes, they tend toward pricey, but you are paying for atmosphere. If you want more budget food on the ship, there is a Starbucks.We flew into Long Beach Airport and took a taxi to the ship (just over $30, probably cheaper with Uber). From there, we used the free bus to the Long Beach waterfront for the aquarium, shops and restaurants, etc.I urge you to pretend you are sailing on The Queen. It will give you a sense of the gracious travel of the era. We dressed up appropriately to tour and dine on two of our three days, and enjoyed the fantasy.",Jilara
40,Thanksgiving travel,The ship is beautiful for its age. The tours are wonderful and informative. We got there too late for the traditional tour so did the audio tour which was very good. Loved the room. It was spacious and comfortable,paortho
40,"Pricey, historic gateaway","A historic ship well worth a visit. Consider a visit before Halloween, as the ship is all decked out and along with it's reputation for being haunted, offers quite a thrill. Many bars and restaurants to choose from, all with killer views of downtown LB.",Sam S
50,Unique Encounter,"We took the ""Paranormal Investigations"" tour. We started our adventure at 11:00pm and it ended between 2:30 - 3:00 am. I recommend getting a room at the Queen Mary for the night since it does get out so late. During the tour we had the opportunity to be hands-on with tour provided paranormal detection equipment, to capture evidence of any paranormal activity. I especially liked the hand held rods which I found very intriguing when I used them. Even though we didn't hear any disembodied voices during the tour, we ran our personal smart phone recordings and video camera to see if we may have caught something upon arriving home. I have not yet listen and view what we may have captured. Our guide, Matt, was very knowledgable and experienced, and eager to answer any questions and offer any assistance. He was a lot of fun and took us to parts of the ship not accessible otherwise. I don't really watch the paranormal shows on TV, and basically am not into this sort of thing, but the night proved to be very fun and a truly unique encounter. So glad I went!",Maria F
20,Not what it used to be,"Recent management is trying, but as it appears, not hard enough. The ship is poorly maintained and the food choices are sub par for the price. Lobby bar was closed and or relocated the last time I was there. This was a hidden on board jewel. food and beverage management has no idea what they're doing!The little village which is just adjacent to the ship, still empty. Long Beach and lessee are always promising a revitalized deal. yeah right. I'll believe it when I see it. Maybe they'll put more outlet stores there because, that's what we need. NOT!",Able
40,Nice piece of history,"We did not do a formal tour, preferring to walk through the ship at our own pace. We topped of the visit with a couple of beverages and snacks in the lounge overlooking the bow of the ship. We enjoyed relaxing where people were traveling first class many years ago. This was an interesting experience even though we did not pay for a somewhat expensive tour",Boat-Captain
40,Fun an interesting; but tours are a waste of time,"Fun to walk around this old cruise ship. Lots of history. But the live tours are poor. We found the audio tour to be a much better experience. Of course, they claim the ship is haunted, but the ghost tour is cheesy theatrics designed to startle and spook you. The history tour was equally poor. Go of the history of the ship and use the audio tour.",Mark B
20,Expensive but some aspects are interesting,"The Queen Mary is interesting but a bit of a financial rip off. High price for parking. A transaction fee for booking your tickets, never mind the entry price.We went in early December and many of the places to eat were closed, which was a disappointment.The ghostly tour was pretty naff - nothing factual at all. Just trying to scare you and pretty much all conducted in the dark, so in spite being told it was a chance to see the boiler room, you can't actually see anything.I've been the Royal Yacht Britannia in Edinburgh and they focus on delivering a high quality visitor experience. The Queen Mary seems to be just trying to get as much cash out of you as possible.",Jilly1970
40,The Queen in Port ...,"The Queen Mary is permanently berthed in her Long Beach resting port and adds a great dimension to the attractions of the city. Over the years we've toured her, gone to parties aboard, spent the night in the ship's hotel, had dinner and just dropped in for snacks & drinks. Plenty to do & the experience is marvelous. Fun for all ages! ...",David B L
50,Go back into our history,"We went on 3 tours plus walked the ship. The tours were: Diana: Legacy of a Princess; The Glory Days Historical and Ghost and Legends.All 3 were amazing and enlightening. I loved learning more about the history of the Queen Mary, U.S. History as well as Princess Diana.",gmeredith
30,Fantastic piece of history,"This is the real cruise ship that has a great story. Imagine a museum you can stay overnight on! There are models of a lot of the classic cruise ships, exhibits to show the history of it's lives as not only a luxury liner but also as a troop transport during WWII. There are shops, restaurants, a coffee shop and gorgeous staterooms. Check it out online and book your stay! Please note that it does need restoration on the exterior - when you pull up, you'll expect the inside to be rough too but the restaurants, guest suites and shops are pristine.",thizizliz
40,A Great Walk Through History,"The tours are wonderful. The WW2 and the Ghost tour are two of my favorites. The food experiences are good, not great. One is more cafe style and good for families. Sir Winston's is fine dining and had great wine choices but not fabulous. The Observation Bar is difficult to get served in but a great place to sit and wait to be served.",Sandy C
40,A very different hotel,"We stayed here as a way of trying a different place to stay. It was very interesting. The use of period correct hardware (faucets & such) is pretty neat! Be aware that there is an extra charge for parking and ""facilities"". If you have never stayed here I would try at least one night. Everything worked, the bed was comfortable.",one_aceracer
40,elegant relic of another age,"We opted for a guided tour, which allowed us entry into locked areas. I recommend this. The guide also knew a lot of the old gal's history, which enriched our experience. The Art Deco decor of the ship is often very beautiful, particularly in the public areas for first class passengers. Alas, since it is also a hotel, we did not get to see suites or rooms themselves.",Mary M

50,Good Historical Trip!,"We were berthed at the San Pedro pier on our Princess cruise and planned this visit while on shore. We caught a cab to The Queen Mary ($30 each way) and when we arrived the doorman asked if we were 'checking in'. I replied we were off the Princess ship and had come for a visit and we were told to show our cabin card for the ship and we would get on free! Had researched extensively prior to the visit and hadn't learned this, which was a pleasant surprize. We took the Historical Tour, friends took the Haunted Tour, and we all enjoyed both tours. Prices had somehow also been reduced from $31 to $10, so another bonus for our converted Canadian dollars. The fellow who conducted our tour was enthusiastic and knowledgeable and advised us how to catch the free shuttle to Long Beach afterwards, and which stop to get off at to find a place for lunch. Overall, a very worthwhile visit and kudos to the City of Long Beach to make this piece of history a permanent fixture. Be sure to allow enough time to wander the ship. We didn't eat there, but there were numerous options to eat.",Cheryl F
40,Better than I thought,"Guides that care. A ship bigger than the titanic and has so much of its original charm and items. The website is confusing and how to get around the boat at times but my geeky family stayed over 3 hours. Ate lunch at promenade,service was great, food is just fine.",summerfunteacher
50,Historically Amazing,"This was my first visit to the Queen Mary. We booked a package tour that came with two tours of the ghost varsity. I didn't find the first tour particularly entertaining for someone in my age group, but it would be awesome for families with children. Our second tour was lead by an amazing gentleman who was a former sea captain himself with Princess cruise lines. This gentleman was very informative, and provided a wealth of information to anyone that asked questions. I'd love to take another one of his tours on the Queen Mary.",Blyons2000
40,A trip into history!,I love how the ship has been restored but wish they would go further and open up even more of it to tourists.We were lucky to have stayed a night probably like 15 years ago and it has improved since then.This ship is a piece of history and you should go visit and bring your children while it is available.Hopefully the SS United States will be restored and wind up in a similar situation so we can all see her in her splendor of yesteryear.,Sapphire Ed
30,It wouldn't take much.....,"To make this a perfect experience! The structure is there, a perfect, historical and well maintained piece of our history. The side attractions are fabulous! Sir Winston's an unsurpassed dining experience. One problem, and it reared it's ugly head all day......no directions telling us where to go or how to get there. No problem you say, just ask an employee ???? Not one employee we asked knew how to direct y'all.....that would have been bad enough in itself, but on 3 of the occasions we were sent off in the wrong direction. When the tours start at specific times, it is nerve racking to be wandering around lost. This is not even mentioning how much walking this venue requires naturally. I wouldn't have missed the ""Queen Mary Chill"" and the ""ice world"" ""historical tour"" and "" Sir Winstons"" for anything ! It would just be nice to know where we're headed",Bsuttie
40,What a ship,"Next to the Titanic, this is probably one of the most famous cruise ships. Great opportunities for photographs of the exterior of the ship. The Russian sub ""Scorpion"" is right along side the Queen, but it is temporarily closed for repairs. Nice place to visit.",Oldguitarmike
50,The best tour guide ever!,"Went on two tours on the Queen Mary. Expecting to be informed regarding the history of the ""Glory Days"" of the ship, we were pleasantly surprised to be taken on an amazing adventure by James. He was extremely knowledgeable. But, with his voice (you just have to hear it!), he engaged all on the tour, children and grandparents. He took is on an adventure and was so animated, I almost felt as if I were truly on a cruise.When you go, you may want to request James. He truly made the trip to the Queen Mary a very memorable event. James with the ""Glory Days"" tour on The Queen Mary.",4margare
50,"enjoyed tour, great tour guide","We visited the queen Mary in late October. our group did the historical tour and enjoyed it very much. the tour guide (James) was knowledgeable , passionate and entertaining. We are still talking about the enjoyable tour. thanks James for a fun afternoon",nancy p p
50,Amazing trip back into time!,"Our trip to the Queen Mary consisted of a King room and the paranormal tour. This was the first time I had ever been on any type of ship. The room was very comfortable, and roomy but I was to short to see the harbor thru the porthole windows. It had the smallest tub I have ever seen but it was very functional for showers. The woodwork is fantastic. To sit outside at the bar at night and see the lights from the deck of the ship was just amazing. The paranormal tour took us to places that the general public is not allowed. Didn't see any ghost, LOL, but a great trip back in time.........",Rwade2015
50,What a Wonderful Ship!,"First I have to say I was torn about whether to book rooms here. The reviews seemed to be all over the board. I'd say it just depends on whether you want a comfortable, modern room; a chain hotel right in town or -whether you want an experience of a lifetime. Four of us booked 2 cabins for 3 nights on the Queen Mary. We're all SO glad we did. It was an experience I know none of us will every forget. The feeling of being part of history is wonderful. I can still see the long corridors in my mind when I think about our stay. We could have spent the entire time roaming around the ship and never even going into town.",Patricia B
50,Art Deco and magical trip back to the past!,"The RMS Queen Mary is definitely a bright standing piece off the 20th century’s history, larger than the Titanic, it is a ship that still displays the luxury of its time and that is full of moving history. Nowadays the Queen Mary is permanently docked at Long Beach California and it hosts an interesting museum with a couple of guided tours, both highly recommendable. It is also home of a floating Hotel, I haven’t had the chance to stay there, but as a museum it’s worth the visit. This is a perfect family friendly environment, reserve at least 3-4 hours to properly enjoy it, it has a lot to see, both walking on your own and by taking the tours.",Francisco H
40,Humongous Ship with lovely historical tales,"Stayed in long beach for 5 days and visit my i queen Mary was during one evening, regular tours conducted by decoratively attired guides is fascinating, it's nice to do so if you are an enthusiast about ships and there history et. Specially a ship like this with lavish decks, lobbies, lounges and added to it are shops and restaurants. Good to spend a quite evening walking inside deck after deck surrounded by antiques and some nice stories which took place du mh it's elaborate times.. 5min by taxi from pine avenue cost $10 one way...Rohan Jayamanna",Gavin2009
50,Awesome ship,My wife and I visited the Queen Mary while on a short vacation to Long Beach and it was amazing. The history of this ship is just awesome. The Lady Diana tour was very emotional and brought back good memories. A must see tour of the entire ship for all.,Dawna D
50,Paranormal Shipwalk,"We didn't really find anything scary about the Shipwalk. The tour guide was good, explained all the history of the queen mary and what happen in certain locations. It's a little expensive. But worth it if you want to learn more about the ship.",Cristina A
50,What a night!,We stayed over night here in a delux cabin. You really feel like you are on one of the best cruise liner of days gone by .... almost like Titanic in the film! And the restaurant is superb!,Roger G
40,Beautiful Historic Hotel,Stayed here on our wedding night. It's a beautiful old ship with a truly classic feel. There are some little things that come with historic hotels (like small rooms and old plumbing) but the staff was wonderful and everything was beautiful. I can't wait to come back for an anniversary.,AuntJeanne
50,2 days on queen Mary,"Very nice experience, a historical landmark....interesting with good restaurant and bar...working around the ship is a unique experience.Considering the age of the ship, you must be a little tolarant with the details...rooms ...ect its not a luxirios hotel anymore...nice but dont expect to much.",alexanderwag
20,What a shame,"A once grand old ship turned into a travel lodge. Had a really poor experience there with some rude staff, a bar closed by 11pm, shower that doesn't work in the morning, room service that never arrived. The ship's notoriety still brings it business but it needs to seriously improve.",rdeeming
40,The Old Queen is a fantastic experience.,"We love to take guests visiting us in Long Beach to the Queen Mary. Be sure to check out the hanging flags in the city of Long Beach which keeps you informed of special shows on the Queen Mary. However, if there is no particular special showing, it is still so worth the visit. I love the feeling of being transfixed to the yesteryear and what it must have been like to sail the high sea on this luxury liner. The history of this old ship is so interesting and the little shops make for an interesting day or half day tour.",Parislvr
50,Old time Charm,"If you love history then the Queen Mary is a must. This lady of the sea is now 80 years old but still desplays the elegance of bygone days. Some tours are included in your standard ticket and additional guided tours can be purchased on board. It is easy to spend a full day on the ship. I took the metro from Hollywood to Long Beach (only cost $1.75 each way) then there is free bus service around the Long Beach area, this takes you to the Queen Mary. Good value for money well worth the visit.",Debra H
40,Historic tour recommended,"Very interesting historic tour with many photo opportunities, she was built in Scotland in the 30's to last.",Windsurfer2000
50,What a fantastic experience!,"My wife and I visited the Queen Mary last week and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Our guide, Roy, was absolutely delightful and extremely knowledgable. There is so much history to absorb. We spent about 5 hours on board and didn't know where the time went! The only slight sticking point was the parking is $18 but if you have a meal in the restaurant on board you you can get $10 taken off but only if your visit is less than 3 hours long!!! We hadn't read the small print so we were disappointed but we did not let this spoil our overall experience. It's worth a visit if you are in the area.",trevcant
50,What a Pleasant Surprise!,"We didn't start out to visit the Queen Mary. We planned to visit the aquarium in Long Beach but after seeing the huge crowds waiting to get in there was no way. We drove around and found ourselves at the Queen Mary. I had visited it several times years ago but wasn't sure my teenage son would like it. We signed up for a tour (partially so we could get on the ship) and had lunch. Lunch was very nice, good food, a great waiter, and an amazing view of Long Beach and the harbor. We took the ""Ghosts & Legends"" tour which was a complete surprise and we loved it! You go down to the boiler rooms and visit the ""haunted"" places throughout the ship on the way…but it was our tour guide, Daniel, who made it so fun! I definitely recommend it! Note: Parking is $18 (!) for the day. If you have your ticket validated at one of the restaurants, it goes down to $8 and they have AAA, etc. discounts.",ckg88
40,Historic,"It's fun to see something as old and classy as the Queen Mary.Beautiful bar, interesting photos and history of the ship.",cherkhan
40,Worth a visit,Enjoyed the traveling exhibitions...lots of places to explore and there is a somewhat physically-demanding ship tour. Many places to relax and watch the seagulls. Hotel stays are quiet...but ask for a room closer to the reception desk for more lavish and comfortable accommodation as well as better disabled access.,twinsaround
50,A Long Beach Tresure,"The Queen Mary is a great way to step back in history to what ships were like and after you visit the Queen Mary, you can go to The Aquarium of the Pacific or any of many restaurants nearby",cmesign4u
40,Great tour of the beautiful ship,"We bought a groupon for two of the ""haunted"" tours. Both were very well, but the 30 minute ghosts with a haunted house like adventure was really well done. You don't get to see a lot of the ship unless you buy one of these tours. I was quite impressed and my 13yr old son loved it! Next time we will likely book a room and stay the night.",Jamie B
40,Wish i could have treavelled on her !,Great visit- excellent informative and friendly tour guide- just an amazing vessel -true British quality if you could afford it.,petert27
50,What a great tour !,"We toured the Queen Mary with the historical tour . If you go try to have JAMES as your guide. He is OUTSTANDING ! He is not your ""average"" tour guide at all. This tour meant a lot seeing where family had traveled years ago and James made their traveling come to life as in comparison to what it would be like today. Thank you JAMES !",gak909
40,Nice for a drink and sightseeing,"if you are not into history very much and not eager to spend 25$ for the ticket just go there for a drink or breakfast and you can explore the ship on your own for free. Good for couple of hours, not much more to do in Long Beach anyway. However there are many good affordable restaurants.",LolaSweden
50,A ghostly good time!,We chose the special King Harbor View room and it was beautiful! The woodwork was amazing and the view of the Long Beach skyline out the portholes was breathtaking. There were thunder storms over the ocean and the lightning added to the wonderful and kinda creepy abiance of this grand old ship! The food is good at the on board restaurants but bring your plastic... they are very pricy!,Doozer2015
50,Going back in time,"If there is any way you have time to do it, watch the movie Titanic a few days BEFORE you visit the Queen Mary. We just happened to do it and it will change the way you view the QM. The ships are both from the same era and are very similar in many ways. We still had the movie images fresh in our minds and when we walked aboard the QM, it was like stepping right into the movie. Very cool!!! We took the self guided tour and just explored the ship. As previously mentioned, the signs don't give great directions and you may end up somewhere that is not part of the tour just like we did. That was even better as we got to see extra areas of the ship that we wouldn't have otherwise seen. There is lots to see and you can spend even more time if you wish since the restaurant is open to the public and you can rent rooms like a functioning hotel, although I expect that would be quite pricey.",Luv2travel_RS
40,Fun for ocean liner history buffs and as a special treat,"A bunch of my female friends and I went to have dinner on the Queen Mary when we were at a conference in Long Beach as a ""last night of the conference"" treat. The free shuttle bus from downtown is a bit confusing, but DON'T try to walk down here, it would be long and treacherous! You just might have to ask the driver to tell you when you finally get to the stop like we did! We went to the cheapest option, the Cafe, and the food was not bad but not stellar, and as predicted rather overpriced. It is the atmosphere and wandering around the ship that is the big attraction here. Oh, the Queen Mary sparkling wine was fun at dinner, made us all feel festive. Not exactly fine champagne but we could pretend, right? You can meander around on a self-guided tour, linger on a deck if you like, just soak in the atmosphere. We stumbled upon a little room where they were playing oral history interviews with people who had traveled on the ship during or after WWII, the stories were very moving (Jewish immigrant escaping Germany, American soldiers coming home, etc.) It is a fun thing to do if you have a few hours in Long Beach. Might be fun to stay overnight on the ship, too, as it is a hotel, but none of us did this. There was also a huge sort of tacky carnival going on right next to the ship, but we did not venture there. It looked pretty scary, but then it was a week before Halloween!",Betty B
30,Could be better,The ship is fascinating; the tour disappointing.A large pre WW 2 ship. Worth seeing but....The tour guide went on talking endlessly with trivia that cut into our time to see most of the ship. He complained that we were walking too slowly. Nonsense.All of us wanted to see guest rooms and the excuse that on the prior night all rooms were booked and none cleaned at 1215 did not make sense.We toured the rest of the ship by ourselves. The maintenance of the ship was poor and that was tragic. Ships need care or they disintegrate.Few signs about where to go. No one who could answer question.Only one pathetic place to eat.,steve3970
40,The Queen of Long Beach,"Went on a tour with family around this beautiful and large ship. The price was a little expensive for the condition of the ship, but worth it for the history. The style is in Art Deco, which is my favorite. The ship needs to be refurbished to its original state, but it is still in good condition. We did a historical tour and it was very informative. Plus, our tour guide was very lively, funny, and nice. I loved going into the main ballroom and imagining how it might of been in its heyday. I recommend this tour if you enjoy history. I also loved the exhibit with all the model ships from the Queen Mary to The Titanic. The models are large of each ship and cut in half so you can see what they looked like inside. Again, it's a fun time for the history buff and highly recommend.",Katie B
40,Be prepared to walk!,"The tour may be expensive, but if you package it with the Aquarium visit, this might be a good deal. Be forewarned that even if you buy the combo ticket at the Aquarium, you must still go to the ticket booth to get a ticket to visit the Queen Mary. We opted to visit the Princess Diana exhibit and self-tour. I felt that it was probably a better idea to get a guided tour instead. While they do provide a guide map, you were on your own to visit the ship and signs and/or explanations were rare to find. We probably lost a lot of time wandering around to get our bearings. The ship is beautiful, but is still needing a lot of repairs and updating. The exhibit of the rooms were indeed interesting, but we came upon it by chance as we walked through the dungeons of the boiler room.",PepperNewJersey
30,Expensive and be prepared for lots of exercise.,"I didn't think it was worth paying over $65 (2 people) for parking, admission and a bottle of water to walk around the hot large ship. The self-guided tour was not organized to see areas on the same deck in order. Instead we went up and down levels forward and aft plus the signage was lacking. I did like the exhibit showing the inside rooms of the ship as it was used.",Brenda B
50,If only I could age so well.....,"Not only does this wonderful old lady of the seas have so many past lives, she is now on display for all to visit and, if you're lucky enough, to spend a night on board.Ghost stories, an exhibition of not only Diana's clothes but British history, tours - both guided or audio - and so much more. The boiler room is colossal and eerie but worth the walk to get to it.And then there's the magnificent Sunday champagne brunch - complete with a harpist! More food than one could possibly eat (but do give it a go!) and your champagne glass is as bottomless as your plate. Held in the original First Class dining room, thus is a treat not to miss.Allow hours to wander this lovely lady and absorb every piece of her history, her art work, her beauty.",Melinda B
30,Grand Old Lady,"The RMS Queen Mary is showing her age. Construction started in 1930 and because of depression was not completed until 1936. The Queen Mary sailed from 1936 to 1967 when she was retired and eventually docked in Long Beach. After sailing for 30 years and sitting at a dock 48 years, the deterioration is evident. The ship’s tour/museum at midship has obviously been modified for visitors but remaining portions of the stern area are gutted and left unfinished. One would expect after 48 years the project should have showed more progress. The hotel area of the ship has a lot of the original charm but lacks the elegance it once had. The rooms are totally original however many of the mechanisms are no longer functional and the furnishings are showing their age. The dining experience is a step above “diner quality” and service is barely average. The ship’s tours are a bit pricey, but the Paranormal Tour did render some results. Yes, my skeptical wife did see her first paranormal apparition in the form of a large black mass that moved through the swimming pool area during our tour. For the remainder of that night my wife heard noises in our bedroom suite that sounded like someone was moving items in the room. I, on the other hand slept like a log. Hotel parking is available at dockside on the pier you pay as you leave. If you are staying overnight parking is free. Parking is also free if you are taking the late night Paranormal Tour. This is only because there is nobody in the toll booth at 1:30am.",Richard D
30,Was OK but sort of a disappointment overall,I took the public transportation to the Queen Mary and entrance was quite expensive and was disappointed to find that the tea room was closed except for Thursday Friday Saturday. I could see the whole traction within 30 to 40 minutes and felt was not the best attraction. I actually took a cruise on the Queen Mary two which was much grander and has much more art and opulence compared to this hotel. I don't think I will return anytime soon. I did not think it would be a good hotel choice either. It's not in the best location for Long Beach.,lindagK1722BF
20,Looks old and tired and needs a refurb on the outside,Looked so old and tired we decided not even to go onboard as it was so off-putting especially with a rusty tatty old Russian submarine next to it.,gazaroonie
50,Loved it.,"Loved the history, take your time, stay a night or two. Pretend you are sailing on the old Grand Dame. Enjoy the audio tour, historic tour and the princess Diane exhibit. The food was great.",Terisa C
50,Afternoon Off,"Took the afternoon off to go to the Queen Mary for a tour. We paid for the history tour. Our tour guide was very entertaining and explained things with passion. There are other tours you can go on but we didn't have time. This wasn't on my ""bucket list"" but i really enjoyed getting to see it.",John D
40,Great historical site at Long Beach Harbor,"The Queen Mary, a behemoth Art Deco cruise ship, is located at Long Beach harbor and is worth touring to anyone visiting the area. Various tours are available to learn more about the ship. I would recommend leaving some time to explore after the tour as well. During various seasons, the QM has special events; for example, right now there are evening ghost tours and it appears that there will be a Christmas themed tour as well. There are several little gift shops for making purchases and several restaurants and bars that are open to the public. There are uneven decks and stairs, so comfortable walking shoes are advised. Also, young children will not be interested in this attraction. I would recommend visiting the QM to anyone visiting the area, especially those with an interest in the glory days of cruise ships.",Mary A
40,Interesting and historical,"The only downside to staying the night on this ship is it has VERY thin walls, I mean THIN. You can hear your neighbors talking! Awkward. So maybe ask to be put in a part of the ship where nobody else is at if you are a really light sleeper (which I am). Otherwise it is a great photo op. Parking is $20.00/night and restaurants are a close drive nearby. The ship is supposed to be haunted which is pretty fun for the kids too.",DeeDeeF71
40,Long boat on a long beach,A majestic craft that has seen better days. It was rather sad to see this once great ship so needing a makeover. It needs painting from top to bottom to restore it to it's former glory. It should take your breath away not make you sigh with disappointment. It is however a great piece of history in dock at Longbeach. Worth a visit but it could be so much more.,Sky051
50,Love this ship!,"My father came across the Atlantic on the Queen Mary in the 1950's so we have a special connection. When you board her, you are taken back to a different time. The wood work is amazing and the size is just shorter the Titanic. We usually have dinner at the Promenade Cafe which is priced between 15-30pp. They have the usual food groups, burgers, pasta, salads, deserts. Sir Winstons upstairs is fine dining and more expensive but the steaks are very good. If it's your first time on the ship, go with the tour guide to get all of the history. Otherwise, the self-guided tour is fine and takes a few hours. Don't miss the engine room and the prop viewing room where you can see one of the giant props still attached and hoping to turn again. If you stay in the hotel, the staterooms are small but comfortable. I recommend getting the suite and doing it right. There are various events throughout the year at the Queen Mary so check the website to see what is happening during your visit. I tried the Halloween event Dark Harbor last week and I would avoid it from now on. Expensive parking, extremely long lines and wait times 1.5 hours for the monster mazes, extra fees for the rides on top of admission, $20 parking, overcrowded is an understatement. Aside from that, I have always had a great experience at the Queen Mary. The ghost tour is great and so is visiting the submarine. I visit her about once a month.",SouthernCalMan
50,Interesting tour,The Queen Mary is full of history! We had a tour of the ship and a history lesson. The location is beautiful as well as the ship and there is even a ghost story if you are into that kind of thing.,Jodi L
50,historical site.,I actually stayed onboard so can't rate it as a day tourist. I love this ship. The exhibits are good as is the tour. The bar is fabulous.,728joanns
40,Walk around and have some food,They have a few restaurants and they also have a bar. Its good to walk around and get your appetite up and then go eat and maybe drinks after.,MikeMImages
40,taste of the old days,We booked a historical tour online so we wouldn't be shut out. The tour was worth the money with all the info we got. You can walk around on your own and see all the stuff we saw on the tour but it was nice to get all the added info. You get to go into a first class suite and see how the privileged traveled in those days.This ship was used to take 1000's of U.S. soldiers to Europe during WW II. It was totally refitted for this purpose and when the war was over the ship was fitted again for passengers.There is a restaurant on board that has good food and a good size menu selection. I had a hamburger and it was very good.,waikoloa01
40,Must see for out of town guests,"Was disappointed that you now have to purchase an entry ticket if not a guest of the hotel. Was always fun to wander the halls, have a drink in the bar, and browse the shops. Now they make you pay to do that.",David R
30,Just OK for a quick walk-around,"Disclaimer - we did not take any tours (the two we wanted to see were the Historical Tour and the Haunted Tour) so we just paid general admission and walked around, but for that, it was just meh. Not very exciting. If we had taken a tour (which would have been more money, of course) we might have felt differently, so take this review for what it's worth.",BenVerona
20,"Nice staff, run down environment, decent food","The blush fell off this rose long ago. A fairly interesting historical visit, but bleak. My wife actually enjoyed the engine room. Good tour guide, food and service reasonable, parking a joke. Since we stayed slightly more than three hours we lost our parking validation. All of it. Not prorated. Voided. Tacking on the full $18 upon leaving, ignoring our validation, was unacceptable.",zzuBzzuBTn
40,Nautical nostalgia at its best,"Its great to see such a historic and beautiful ship being preserved and put to good use , I used to work in Shipbuilding so for me this was a great day out and to see the craftsmanship which went into the building and outfitting of this ship was amazing.The guide we had was also great , he gave us a real insight into the way it was to travel on this ship in its heyday .",brian_purtle
50,"Go during Dark Harbor in October! 3 mazes are on the already haunted boat, included in the entry fee. Rooms small","Love the old boat! Attended a beautiful wedding in the beatiful Art Deco ballroom once, was one of the neatest locations for a wedding. Hotel rooms are small which is what you'd expect on the historic vessel, but some people forget that that is part of the experience. I love the haunted house in October-get the fast pass if you do otherwise you will stand in ridiculous lines- the upgrade is worth every penny! Love it how there is a maze in the boiler room and where old pool was, even more spooky as it is supposed to be already haunted.",Timothy V
30,Beautiful History at a Premium Price,"The Queen Mary is an icon in CA. It's an Art Deco-era ship that is the Grande Dame of its genre. The beauty that went into crafting this ship is evident everywhere, from the fine wood used for floors, walls and ceilings, to the embellishments typical of the era, including polished columns and brass railings and sensuously curved ogees.I love history and particularly this era of history, which spans the 1930s to 1960s. I wanted to immerse myself in all of it, but that's difficult to do, unless you are lodging there. Parking is extra, tours are extra, food and beverages are expensive...they get you coming and going.My husband and I booked a self tour with a haunted guided tour. We did the haunted tour first, and we were disappointed by the lack of frights. Then we took the self-guided tour, which we ended abruptly due to my bad knee preventing any more flights of stairs (and there were LOTS of those). In total we were there 3 hours (including lunch) and that felt rushed.All in all, I'm glad we went to see this attraction but really? The excessive cost? Too much for too little in return. And kids are likely to be bored long before the end of any tour.",Candace M
40,Long beach,"IT was good to see the queen Mary as my cousin came to America on her when he was 6 month old,the ship is used as a hotel with a restaurant and a couple of bars,there is also a princess Diana exhibition on board,for food we went to legends in long beach the food was out this world",karen g
40,A Step Back In Time,"Well we missed the Catalina Express boat and needed to kill some time. We thought why not the Queen Mary. We opted not to go on the tour so our tickets were just $15 each and it turns out you get to use them dollar for dollar at the restaurant. We walked around the ship and then headed to the restaurant for some appetizers and drinks. In the end by using our $15 tickets our meal ended up being less than $5 before tip. Don't forget to have your ticket validated to get your parking discount too.It was a great way to kill some time, take in some history and have a bite to eat with friends.",jeff s
50,Amazing Halloween Experience,The Queen Mary's Dark Harbor event gets better each year. Friends and I have went multiple times but this years event has been the best. If you're looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday night this is to place to be in October. Get there early!,storm3644
10,Beware the Dark Harbor,"I participate in many Halloween activities and attractions in the course of a season,and I can say, without question, thatThe Queen Mary Dark Harbor is the worst.They don't limit ticket sales, so the crowdsare enormous, and they don't control thehuman traffic flow, so you can be guaranteed very long waits, with a minimumof actual maze/show time.On top of that, there are a lot of extra charges for shows, (other than the mazes), and ""Fast Pass"" upgrades for the mazes,that they spring on you.Save your money and precious time,and stay away from this one.",Trent W
40,Excellent Place for a Sunday Brunch,"Our second time on the QM. Have Valet parking or Self Parking, Our reservation was ready.No waiting time. Buffet was very nice. Not really high end. But very wide in variety. Offer Salad station, Seafood station, meats, desserts, eggs, etc.All staff very friendly.Need to work on maintenance of the place, and cleanliness in bathrooms.",GustavoOrtegaJ
50,Totally Worth The Trip To Long Beach,The Queen Mary is well worth the trip to Long Beach. There is lots and lots of walking so wear comfortable shoes. This ship offers up many interesting facets that will satisfy anyone that loves history. There is currently a Lady Diana exhibit going on that is an additional charge. We spent over 7 hours exploring the ship and probably would have spent more time if our energy didn't fade.,CherylMerrill
20,Over priced!,"Visited with the family for a ghost tour. Got the ""first class horror tour"" and I thought it was a waste of money. The only scary thing was the fact that I paid over $125 dollars for this...",beca-travels
50,Very nice nostalgic tour of a great old ship,"We had a Groupon for the tour and that made it a very good value. Unfortunately we had tried to cram too much into our day (Iowa and Segway) and were a few minuted late for the last tour of the day. But we were able to latch onto the end of another, and got another full tour, just different than we had booked. Well worth the time to see.",2Tig
50,"A truly WONDERFUL,not to be missed highlight of our 1st time California vacation","An AMAZING experience... especially for but not in any way limited to cruise ship buffs, nautical historians, fans of the 1930's and art deco, or the British Royal connection. We had a wonderful time in each and EVERY aspect of out overnight stay on the Queen Mary.As a major fan and amateur buff on cruiseships - especially of the Cunard line and of the Golden age of transatlantic travel, seeing, being on, touring, and then actually staying over night on the Queen Mary was a major personal bucket list accomplishment.From the drive up to this great lady - seeing her come into view from the highway- brought true excitement and goose bumps. It was a dream come true - seeing the towering narrow slicing bow, the smoke funnels, rigging, etc., etc., etc. Then to realize the dream that we would be staying on board overnight, and getting to explore and tour all areas of the ship for a full day was an experience not to be missed.We parked and were received at the main entrance, directed to the check-in desk - all in great manner and efficiency. Our check-in was handled extremely well, and as requested we were upgraded to two amazing suite cabins - ours - truly a suite with foyer, kitchen, full dining room, living room, separate bedroom, period bathroom, and wonderful porthole views overlooking Long Beach.After dropping off our luggage and exploring the room, we did a brief walk around the main areas, along several of the deck promenades, the wonderful period shops, paneled hallways, amazing perspective of the noticeably dramatic curve of the floor as it bends from bow to stern. We discovered information on the daily behind-the-scenes tour and immediately booked the next one available, and to our luck and surprised we were the only people to sign-up and book this tour time period - so ended up have a totally private and exclusive tour of the great liner, her history, and amazing secret areas not viewed but the general walk-on walk off passengers.If you have the opportunity...don't miss taking the guided tour of the ship - not to be missed. Our guide and the tour proved to be one of THE highlights of our entire trip.An additionally superior highlight was a dinner that we booked at the ships on-board top rated restaurant 'Sir Winstons'... again one of the best dining highlights we have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The atmosphere was superior, the service impeccable, the food superb - even for some who is not a steak fan, I ordered the prime rib... one of THE BEST meals i have ever eaten - the view -out across the bay and to the lights of Long Beach perfect, romantic, and setting the tone for a full shipboard experience.Our only regret... We had to catch an early morning ferry to Catalina Island (certainly worth the day trip) so had to get up at 4:30 AM to checkout and depart the ship.I would have loved to to stay on board and explore another full day at least, and maybe stay an extra night.If you ever have the opportunity to visit, tour, or even stay aboard this great classic ship- do not hesitate to do so.I only hope that we can return and do the same again some day soon.",brianwickens407
50,Ate at the resturant,The burger I had was huge. I could hardly get my mouth around it. We also walked around the ship looking at the memorabilia. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommend.,Kelly S
50,Amazing stay,We stayed one night at this ship hotel and must say it was wonderful. The whole history the rooms and the decor was Amazing. The food was OK walking the ship was like walking back in time.,Dave M
50,Lovely old girl!,"we loved our stay on the Queen Mary, lots of old features still present such as taps and bathroom fittings and mirrors and lights from the original boat still in the cabins, great views over to long beach. We only stayed one night but a very memorial one as you can do a self guided tour free of charge and wonder around and think about all the many people which have stayed on this historical ship. the bar is great lovely cocktails and amazing original features such as painted murals and cast aluminium fittings. If you want a hotel with no character in which you could be staying anywhere in the world don't visit howeever if you are after staying on a real piece of history not altered much I would highly recommend the Queen Mary - we loved it!!Staff were very helpful when we had to have a case delivered to the boat - even though we had left they kept it safe for us until we where able to pick up- Thank you!!",ClareArent
30,Wear comfy shoes,We went to Sunday brunch on the queen Mary...it was awesome! Champagne just keeps coming again and again. There is a station for just about everything. It's well worth the money for this brunch!We walked the boat afterwards. It was a good day.,K Vuksanovich
30,Interesting bit of history,"Probably would mean more to a history buff than someone who was just passing some time. To me, it's just a boat that only rich folks could afford.",Bryant W
40,CGCS,Visiting the Queen Mary was a wonderful experience to historic value of the visit was amazing. This ship is amazing in all it's glory in the restoration of it to the way it was back then is incredible the craftsmanship the amazing size of it and just the classiness a bit special work you could imagine just being back in the 30s on the ship traveling across the ocean! All the different rooms and on the deck on the galleys on the whole way if it was quite good experience definitely royalty first class the ship well worth history is amazing. Well worth the trip well worth taking in the Queen Mary!,JDufay
50,Just ..... Amazing,"She's old, and has been about a bit, but what elegance she has and stories she could tell! This was a wonderful experience. The guide was very knowledgeable, and amusing. We spent a lot of time on board and saw so much. Well worth it.",WFG2804
50,A must see,"What a beautiful ship, with lots of interesting facts and stories. So glad I went to see this. The history is great and they also do extra things like they have a Halloween special but I was just to early for it.",willos1
40,Interesting visit,"Well worth a trip to visit the Queen Mary, there is an area dedicated to Princess Diana, please be there before 5 if you wish to see it.",bluebluebells
40,very cool dining experience,"very cool experience, food was very good, service was great.very glad we decided to have dinner, it was an awesome experience.",SandraK464
50,A piece of history!,"My daughter and I took the audio tour of the ship and the Princess Di exhibit. We took our time, and I don't think we missed an inch of the ship that was available for us to see. It is an amazing ship with an amazing history. We ate an appetizer in the bar/restaurant and it was good and reasonably priced. There was a lot of walking and going up and down steps. I think it would be fun to attend an event or spend the night on The Queen Mary.",K C
50,Tour the Queen Mary - you'll be happy that you did!,"We drove to the Queen Mary after landing in CA and thought we'd just grab a few pictures and go - and that's what we did. Luckily for me, my hubby expressed an interest in returning to take the tour, and we did on our last day in CA - it was incredible!!! I fell in love with the Queen Mary...so much so that when we got home we looked into staying overnight on the QM during our next visit, as well as investigating cruises offered on the QM2 and Queen Elizabeth. Wow, what an experience it must have been back in the heyday...I can only image and hope one day to experience a piece of the grandeur!",barbarapoetx
40,Queen Mary Paranormal Ghost Walk was cool,"This ship is bigger than the Titanic and its open to the public for dinner, hotel accommodation and ghost walks.I chose the ghost walk, which I loved. The upper levels are still in mint condition but the lower levels are under lock and key, old dark and rusty. This is the area they use for the ghost walks. The guide was very knowledgeable and had a good sense of humor. When you walk round the haunted areas you have a heavy pressure feeling around you. The old swimming pool and diving board area is very creepy.A must see in Long Beach. 8/10",BRIAN S
50,Amazing Ship ! -- Amazing History !,"Queen Mary Ship - Long Beach, California. What an awesome display of history! We began our adventure with looking around the ship ourselves, Followed by the guided tour. This ship was amazing & so well kept and upgraded as needed. The tour included viewing various rooms & displays. We Toured the engine room & museum area. A time line explained the ship's history. On the ""bridge"" we viewed original navigation equipment & communication devices. Original radios were seen. The ship's bar was old decor & beautiful. We enjoyed a beer seated at the window where we watched the very humorous/entertaining seagulls. The main ballroom was ornate with the very impressive tall ceilings. Our visit to the Queen Mary was such an enjoyment, we walked around the ship over 4 -1/2 hours.",Linda W
50,Amazing Dark Harbor !,"We booked over Internet the Queen Mary Dark Harbor and it was an fantastic evening. Next day we booked the normal Queen Mary visit and it was even more impressive. There is a free bus shuttle from long beach town, check the stops on Internet or share a cab, the parking at the Queen Mary is too expensive (18-20 dollars).",G C
50,Interesting tour,"We arrived bought our tour tickets and immediately headed for the Promenade Café.The service here was excellent. We had just arrived from New Jersey and the waiter had several tips for us that were very helpful. Lunch was delicious.The tour was the haunted historical tour. No ghosts, just stories about what other visitors had claimed to see and hear. We also got to see the engine room and prop, a state room, and the pool. We also heard a lot of historical information and our guide Matt was very knowledgeable.I would highly recommend a trip here.",sraso
20,Queen Mary's Dark Harbor Halloween attraction not so great,"Although we had heard about this Halloween event at the Queen Mary in Long Beach for years, this is the first year we have attended & were disappointed.The line just to enter the grounds stretched for a mile or more & the lines for each maze/attraction inside were even worse. It is ridiculous to stand in line for 2 hours in order to experience 2 minutes in a maze. Almost every maze/attraction was like that.The entertainment on the live stages was uniformly terrible. Who is booking these acts? And do they actually watch the acts before hiring them? Really lame & boring.The long waits (literally several hours) for each maze/attraction could be alleviated somewhat by offering music or some other form of entertainment to pass the time better, but for most attractions, none of this was provided, making the long waits seem interminable.Also, the costumed characters that were hired to roam the grounds & scare people seemed very bored & totally uninterested in their jobs. A little more effort & enthusiasm would go a long way here!This is not an even that we will revisit in future years...",Evan B
30,Nice to be able to see,"Docked at the Long Beach Harbor are two interesting vessels to check out, the Queen Mary and the Scorpion Submarine. The Queen Mary was used as a luxury cruise ship for years before being retired to this area to become a floating luxury hotel and fine dining establishment. In order to board, tickets needed to be purchased for one of the many available shows, or planning on eating. We just wanted to take a look at the interior furnishings, but it was pointed out by one of my companions it probably looked no different than any other cruise ship she’d been on. The Scorpion Submarine was a captured Soviet vessel which normally could be toured, but it was currently closed for maintenance. A small nearby building was where tickets were purchased to gain entry to the submarine, as well as other souvenirs. Both of these are interesting pieces of history which should be visited when the opportunity presents itself.",Dave M
50,Interesting historical tour!,"I took my 9 year old grandson, for his first visit to the Queen Mary. We were privileged to be able to tour the Queen Mary for the 70th Anniversary to the end of World War II and we took the historical tour.On the day of our tour, the California Historical Group organized displays of items and told brief stories from the time when the Queen Mary was used during World War II and was labeled the Grey Ghost. These men and women, while dressed in period clothing, kept everyone completely captivated during their speeches of what “they” did during WWII, from military personnel, home makers, nurses and more. The displays they had were wonderful!We learned what areas of the ship were used for the hospital during her service, the fact that she was the first luxury liner to have her own kosher kitchen, some of the dignitaries who sailed on her and just how many men and women she carried home from service during WWII.And for those of you who will be asking, yes, the Queen Mary is haunted. In the 165 photos I took while on the ship, I caught orbs in roughly 60 of the 165 photos! So make sure to take your time, take lots and lots of photos and you too may catch spirit orbs in your photos! Let's see if you can see them in some of these photos!Be prepared. Wear good walking shoes because the Queen Mary is quite large, and you will need to do a lot of walking to see all the wonderful art deco pieces, the beautiful artwork and all the little “hidden” treasures on board. I would suggest taking a tour, and then after the tour is completed, explore the ship on your own. You may be amazed at what you can find your own while on board! Be sure to make it to the propeller room at the very bottom of the ship, that in itself is worth the trip!",charlottesl
50,Great 2 nights,Fantastic experience. Food lovely and a wide choice even if a little expensive. The tour around the ship was excellent.,mrsnobbyali
50,Queen Mary - Long Beach gem,"The Queen Mary is Long Beach's gem. You can see if from Shoreline Village, the restaurants at the Pike and the Aquarium. We've stayed on board once several years ago but heard they've update some of the guest rooms. We also like the brunch but due to the expense, only save it for special occasions or holidays. It's fun to stroll the many decks and even go down below. Not sure how accessible the entire boat is because we use the stairs.",lkstumm
50,Great place to stay.,My daughter and I stayed here for one night and the accommodations were nice. We went to Disneyland and it was not a far distance.,Carrie L

50,The Queen Mary in Long Beach CA Overnight stay.,"Over night stay on board the historic Queen Mary in Long Beach California. A real step back in time to a bygone age of elegance. The ship exudes class, and although some of it's splendour is showing signs of fading, this does not detract from the sense of history, and luxury for which this was the forerunner. I note that some reviews have commented that it is dated and threadbare, but they are missing the point; this is a piece of history well worth preserving. The Rooms retain many of the original features, and yes, there are some signs of wear and tear but who cares if you are staying in such a beautiful and important setting as this! But be warned, the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything from the adjoining rooms! :-) The staff are very well turned out, unobtrusive and efficient; nothing seems to be too much trouble. The guided tour conducted by the Ship's commodore is both informative and very moving. There is a good range of on board restaurants ranging from Fine dining in Winston's through to a breakfast coffee bar. Advance booking for the Oyster Bar or Winston's is advised; they are not cheap but you will not be disapointed! Early evening cocktails on the sun deck are a must and a stroll on the promenade deck in the evening sun is just glorious! Good selection of on board shops stock quality products; which is a welcome change from the usual poor quality tat offered elsewhere.The Queen Mary exists only because of the generosity of the visitors and receives no government funding so visit, stay, and eat to keep this grand old dame of the seas.",Gingoblin
50,Experience History,"The Queen Mary is an experience worth having. It truly feels like visiting history, stepping back in time to see how people lived and traveled back then. It is HUGE and requires a lot of walking and stair climbing, so wear comfortable shoes. Some areas are a bit slippery - the ship is kept impeccably clean and thousands upon thousands of feet have made the wood decks well worn so walk with caution and awareness. The grand rooms are breathtaking. Everywhere you look, there are ornate details worth admiring.",AfrobellaBlog
50,Company customer appreciation event - success !!,"We used the venue for a customer appreciation event. The staff was very helpful, the food very good and the accommodations quite nice. The ability to wander about the ship and explore to your hearts content was an added bonus. There is a grand ballroom that was perfect for dancing and socializing.",B-ManSVT
40,Great but could have been excellent...,"For most of my adult life, I have wanted to tour the ocean liner Queen Mary currently on display in Long Beach California. Well, now that I have done it, allow me to point out the good, the bad and the ugly.Overall, it was amazing. An outstanding value for $31.00 a ticket (Groupon discounts available) The exterior of the ship, decks, bridge and many other areas were close to the way they were when the ship still sailed. On board restaurants, at least the one we ate in, The Promenade Cafe were good. Service was quick, staff polite and food very good.The guided tour was a bit theatrical and superficial only showing cabins decks and ball rooms. But, the self tour after that where they allow you to roam the ship as long as you like was MUCH better!Allow me to preface with what I think is an out and out insult to the ship, it's builders and those who sailed on her, the so called ""Ghost Tour"" and the damage to the ship from removing and altering many areas to accommodate this insulting, totally fake and beyond cheesey waste of time.That being said, I would take the historical tour again but still say the self guided tour afterward is the best. If you are a true fan of these grand ships, you will be able to go down into the After Engine Room, but not the boiler room as far as I could tell, where most everything is intact and looks ready for operation.And, you will find a new area where the forward engine room was ripped out (what a total mistake on the part of the operators) This area has been many things but is now being made into a museum. Here you will find many items from the ships past and two rather amazing things, the ""Prop Box"" and the steering gear room. Both are amazing and worth finding, that all I'll say about them.In conclusion, even though many areas of the ship have been striped or are in disrepair, everything else make it a worth while trip. Just don't do the ghost crap, it will be a major disappointment.",Bob F
50,No ghosts but lots of fun,"The Paranormal ghost tour of the Queen Mary was fun, but be prepared to walk. We saw parts of the ship not normally accessible and learned a bit of the Queen Mary's history. Although we visited the hot spits for ghosts, no such luck that night..but it was a fun way to learn and get exercise.",BlondieOriginal2014
40,Grand old queen,This is a step back in time as to what sea travel would have been like in the thirtys and before world war 2 She must have been a grand lady in the day . Good restaurants on board this ship,Stan Y
30,Make RESERVATIONS Prior to Going!,We didn't make prior reservations and found ourselves with only one type of tour available unless we wanted to wait a couple of hours. It was the haunted tour. They warned us. Our 12 year old ran out at the first stop when the special effects started. We did a free self guided walking tour while our kid snapped out of his shell shock. Lots of walking but very interesting for the parents. Not so much for the kid.,Bounderoo
40,Piece of history,"Let me start by saying this is cool. Stay at the hotel and tour the ship, you are staying on a piece of history and it's going to be one of the most unique stays you have had.",Fernando J
50,Historically amazing!,"It's so cool to step on the Queen Mary and know that you are walking on history! It's a nice ship in good condition and it's so interesting to hear the backstory of the Mary.We signed up for the 30 minute ""Ghosts & Legends"" interactive tour. If the rating was based off of the tour itself, I would say maybe a 3 star. It's a little cheesy (good for kids I guess) but as two twenty something adults we wish we would have done something different.The announcer or ""tour guide"" sounded bored and like he didn't want to be there. The acting wasn't awesome, but I guess he's not hired to be an actor.I was kind of expecting to learn about each ghost or hear people's experiences, but it's basically a dark walk through - fake-out of ""scary"" moments. We were experiencing the ""paranormal"" in a haunted house sort of way.I do think the historical facts behind the tour and learning about the ship was cool though. And at the end you end up on the top of the ship outside and that's an awesome place to be.",Taylor P
30,Old Queen,Apart from been able to hear everything in the cabin next door you can hear everything in the corridors and the plumbing is very noisy. I would recommend visiting the old relic but there is no reason to stay on-board - it is not a cruise,kevxxxx
30,Not as good second time around,"I'm really a person who sees the glass half full but taking my over 18 year olds to the Queen was a bit of a disappointment.First I will say I was here 10 years or so ago and the tour was fantastic. Got to see some First Class Staterooms, the infamous pool, the boiler room and the ballrooms. This time around the pool is off limits, ballroom off limits and no real map of how to navigate through the old gal.We spent a lot of $$ and I really think they need a new direction and some interactive tours to really take you through the experience.Was really a non event to me and I wish I could have taken my older adult children on my first sojourn.",CanadaRockiesgirl
50,Classic Beauty,"Hubby arranged a birthday weekend for us last year, and we had a wonderful time. The ship is in constant renovations due to its age, but it's still the same majestic classic beauty that it is. We loved the tours and had fun getting lost while exploring. The staff was very attentive to our needs. Had a wonderful time.",Lynn M
10,What a sad end for a regal boat,"We had really been looking forward to seeing the Queen Mary, but were so disappointed to see it being so poorly managed as an attraction. Problems started when we tried to purchase tickets online. The website is unnecessarily flashy and sensationalistic - cheap looking, plus incredibly confusing and simply would not work to purchase tickets ahead. We tried for days and the concierge at our hotel had no luck, either. When we tried to call we just got a recording directing us to the website. When we arrived we found the information posted on the ticket booth to be equally confusing and the ticket agent did not give us clear information on our options. Basically, the ""packages"" are designed to gouge as much money out of you as possible, forcing you to see things you don't want to see in order to see things you do. It cost us $33 per person just for an hour long history tour. This included a half hour ghost tour that we had no interest in and did NOT include the Princess Diana exhibit that we did. The Princess Diana exhibit was a separate $29 charge per person. And this did not include the $18 parking fee! The ghost tour was a complete sham. Basically you were walked for a half hour through unlit and unrefurbished halls in the bowels of the ship, where occasionally some lights flashed and eerie sounds were heard. That was it -- no stories, not even interesting dialog from the bored guide. The history tour took you to exactly one room that was not open to the general public anyway and, for an hour long tour, the guide provided a very small amount of real information and a lot of really cheesy attempts at jokes. So sad, given that this ship has a truly fascinating and serious history. My son and husband felt that the free engine room was the most interesting offering, but were in hysterics at the poor signage provided -- every word capitalized, random commas thrown in everywhere, and sentences that were impossible to parse. Lunch provided a nice view, but, as with everything else, was way overpriced and of mediocre quality. Think $15 hamburgers barely a cut above McDonalds. And the entire cafe reeked of cooking oil. So much more could be done to preserve and communicate the history of this vessel and the times it functioned in. We wouldn't mind the high prices if you got a quality product. But this was a poorly done ripoff.",AHNack
20,Major disappointment.,"I was looking forward to staying on the Queen but it took 45 min. after our arrival to get A/C. The next morning we had no hot water and were told it was a system wide problem. However, after 90 min. Richard showed up and we had hot water. I had called a manager who was supposedly busy with another patron with the same problem and was told I would get a call back with some accommodation for doing without. No call came.$20 for parking and a ""facilities fee"" of $15 were automatically added to our bill. Cheap and petty.",ghinga
40,A remarkable experience,"I had the first class passport and enjoyed both guided tours. I also enjoyed searching through the ship on my own, especially exploring the engine room. It is a pricey attraction, however, when you add the parking and tour prices. They also had a beautiful exhibit featuring Princess Diana, but they wanted a separate entry fee. All in all, a delightful day filled with history.",John V
30,Was disappointed,"Was disappointed you had to buy an expensive ticket (like $45 each) just to walk through the Queen Mary - last time I was in California, it was free.Dock area also had a German submarine attraction - I was not impressed.Parking free for about 30 minutes, then outrageous after that,",flpattie
50,The experience and the ship were bigger than the Titanic,Spectacular! Make sure and take one of the tours that will guide you in your experience. The guides are very knowledgeable and complement the tour,TopfoodieD
50,Must do the haunted tour if you are with kids,"We had a baby and three 5 to 8 years old kids. The baby did not have a clue what was happening. To the kids, the haunted tour was very authentic and it scared them! They loved it. There was also a room where they spent an hour with legos.We adults also had a good time learning about the rich history of the ship.We probably should have booked a room and spent more time on board the ship. Entry fees were not cheap.",waijgjy
50,Regal and old world glamour,It was such a beautiful and regal ship that contained so much history and former glamour. I highly suggest this tour and would love to see it again.,babsrunning
40,Excellent hotel and attraction,"Hotel onboard is operated by Wyndom Hotels, and service is excellent. Great restaurants on board also. Prices are slightly higher than surrounding hotels.Room is great, good beds and temperature.Superb attraction is an audio tour of the ship that takes you from bridge to the screws and the engine room. Free to registered guests. Very cool!!!Exterior os ship is getting in need of maintenance, you can see the evidence of the salt air environment getting to the exterior surfaces.Parking is relatively expensive, $18 per day, but ship itself is free and tours can be done even if not a guest for a fee.But if you ever wanted to see how folks lived in the 1930's and during the War, it is a magnificent attraction.",xpmeagle
50,Historic Floating Working Hotel With and Amazing View.,"A MUST SEE when in Long Beach. Full of all kinds of cruise, marine and military history. Full working hotel with suites once frequented by many celebrities and dignitaries from around the world. Quite a scenic from the ship to the Long Beach shoreline. Doubles as a museum with artifacts dating back about 100 years or so.",Eric B
40,Postive,"The staff were competent, through and well-educated. I felt protected and that I was part of history. However, what I enjoyed was the film /cinema room regarding people who once traveled on the Queen.",Julie O
40,fab,saw this for the 1st time back in 1980 was very impressed then and still am. Saw them filming on board and mum had her picture taken in the directors chair lol cheeky,acaHampshireUk
50,well worth it,"Was dubious due to the cost but went for it, had a really interesting guide who had very interesting gestures to describe what live was like for the rich and famous travellers back in the day, you tour all around the ship and get to see an example of the rooms you can actually book and stay on since it is a working hotel.",Dave T
50,Very convenient close to the cruise line,"Had a great stay on the Queen Mary, our room was not going to be ready till later that day as we arrived very early, they offered u an upgrade and it was very nice, they have a few tours to go on, we attend the audio tour which is a self gueided tour which we enjoyed very much! The beds were comfortable and the two bath rooms was a plus for us as there were three of us, Me and my two boys,, Service was excellent staff very nice and meals were very good, Breakfast Buffett was excellent! rooms were average and price was good",lorriemoore
30,Crowded,"Bought the ticket through Goldstar.... $10. Good deal~The Parking - $20???? Really? The admission ticket is not cheap already, give us a break on the parking please!No separate line for WILL CALL..... wait more than 30 minutes. (arrived at 5pm). Another 30 minutes wait just to get to pick up the parka. :(It is cold inside but with the excitement & posing for picture after picture.... don't feel the cold anymore!! :DThe Ice Kingdom is way smaller than I thought..... finished it within 30 minutes. Refused to leave.... let's check out all the sculpture one more time and take more pictures!!!Beautiful ice sculpture~ Very impressive!!The food is not cheap at all.Glad I checked out this event at least once.",ILoveFoodComa
50,Visit a Vintage Vessel (or Two)!,"OK, let me give you some figures based on my own experiences. The aircraft carrier I lived on was 1070 feet long, and QM is 1018 feet long. The carrier I lived on had 10 decks (floors), and the QM has 12 floors? The carrier I lived on was 270 feet wide, and the QM was 118 feet wide. The carrier I lived on displaced 80,000 tons, the QM displaced 80,000 tons. So basically, except for width (needed to land aircraft) you have a ship of roughly the same dimensions. But what a difference in style! The Art Deco, brass, fixtures, panelling. Never had that aboard my floating airport! Never had the high class chow either! Advice here, parking is $18, but you can get a chunk of that back by getting your parking stub validated at one of the restaurants on the ship. We decided on the first class historical tour in combination with the USS Iowa Battleship tour $36 per person). It was great! Very 1930s as well as very nautical. Just our cup of tea. Oh, and speaking of,tea, we had the Windsor Tea experience in the Tea Room ($32 per person, open 11-4). My British wife thought it was superb, authentically British and not a U.S. Imitation. She particularly loved the quality of the scones! Enjoy!",etweeden
50,CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK...,I knew very little of the ship and its history prior to my arrival. I was enamored with its rich history and nostalgic look. You can't help but feel you've been transported into the 30s onboard a great ocean liner fit for royalty.,kamanojk
50,Wonderful day spent on the Queen Mary,Plenty to do and see on the big ship. They have a tour guide named Keith. His knowledge of the history of the ship is excellent and he has a way of making the tour fun. He was my tour guide last year and I hope when I return he'll still be there.,Linda B
30,Aboard the Queen Mary,"Booked two tours on the ship and dined at The Promenade restaurant. Lunch was very good. As a vegetarian, it was limited choice but the spinach wrap I did order was delicious.As for the tours, the QM is a huge ship. Wear comfortable shoes and allow at least half a day if you want to see as much as possible. I did not think the history tour was worth it. You could probably get just as much from the self-guided tour with audio and reading about the ship on your own. The tour only covered parts of deck 4. It was very hot and some areas have no open windows. Take water!We also took the haunted tour - no special effects. This one did go to lower decks and included a visit to a famous haunted stateroom no longer used. However, we were left at the engineering section (after visiting the boiler room) on our own and had to find our way back to the main part of the ship with what ended up being some difficulty. Lots of guess work and wrong turns, which was annoying given we were very hot and tired. This could prove difficult for some individuals. Signage could be better.All in all it was worth the visit. Don't miss the officers quarters and bridge. We nearly didn't include seeing because of the heat and exhaustion, but I'm so glad we climbed those stairs. It was almost better than the history tour and probably should be added to it.Also, the sun deck has some lovely rest spots to enjoy the view.",VonneSolis
40,The Queen Mary,Still one of the old Grand Dames of boats. It is located in the heart of piers with fairly confusing turns depending on how you approach it. Just follow the signs and you will get there. Paid parking and plenty of it. Events abound in the area.,Umbear
50,Cool ghost tour,"A lot of cool history here and a great Halloween gig that start Oct 1st, the Queen Mary has something for everyone. Great day trip-$18 parking though",Rebecca J
20,:-(,I expected a unique experience but not this. So the rooms are not updated which is a shame for what you spend to stay there. Also there was a fake fire alarm at 2am that no one told the guest what was going on.,SRob254
50,Historical ship complete with ghosts.,"We found ourselves in awe looking at this huge ship in person. The pictures do it no justice. On board you feel like your on the set of a titanic movie. We took the ghost tour and boy it creeped us out. During the tour it felt like we were being watched. And the trip down to the basement of the ship complete with its rustic smells definitely made the trip worth while. Though it's pricey ticket wise, I must say it was worth it to be able to see this beautiful ship.",Torres Consulti... F
50,Great Brunch,My husband and I did the Champagne Brunch there on Sunday. The food and service were wonderful! With brunch you can walk the ship on a self tour. Or pay 10.00 now for a guided tour.,Karen and Bill I
40,Drinks and appetizers at the Queen,I took the water taxi to the Queen Mary. We had to pay $15 to enter but u can use that on drinks or food. We went to the Obervation bar which is lovely and Art Deco style. We had a couple of drinks and some food and checked out the great view. Fun!!,annehafner
50,Historic place,"Nice tours, both historical and haunted available and in different languages. Prince Diana exhibition going on, great collection. Russian submarine also available.",Arnaldo V
50,The Queen Mary - well worth a visit,"My husband and I dropped our 2 Teenage daughters at Disneyland and headed to The Queen Mary at Long Beach.We decided to buy the 1st Class Pass which gave us 2 tours (1 Haunted & 1 Historical) also access to the Princess Diana Memorabilia room.Both tours were great - The Haunted tour was very Theatrical and quite jumpy at times, but done really well, took you down to the engine rooms and areas not covered on the main tour, not suitable for wheelchairs as lots of uneven flooring.The Historical Tour was really interesting and made even more so by the guide and covered areas also not available if you are not on a tour.We had afternoon Tea also on board and we were both very pleasantly surprised with the presentation and selection.An added bonus was the temporary ""Princess Diana Memorabilia display"" which was very well displayed and extremely interesting for anyone who enjoys Royal History.We were both surprised how long we spent on Board the Ship, it is very much a full day if you want to enjoy it at leisure.We both agreed next time we would stay overnight on-board :)",suzie.w@live.com.au
50,Great Museum,"Gotta see this! It is worth the price, it is a great museum, go to every level, the best ones for us were the bowels of the ship, dark and spooky, the guides were silly cute at making it spooky, but the whole experience was great. Highly recommend.",S M
50,Very pleasant experience,Recently got married stood our first night as a married couple here. Very pleasant experience. Loved the tour included!,Patricio M
20,Not haunted but too noisy,Stayed overnight here and what a mistake. Sure there's a lot of history on the ship but I would highly recommend staying elsewhere and visiting it for the day instead. The walls are paper thin and you hear everyone who's room is adjacent to yours as if they are in your room. Plus the halls to enter the rooms are three feet away from the beds so all you hear is foot traffic and talking all night. The beds are old and warn out. What you are paying for is the nostalgia. It is not worth it!,Gary L
50,The beautiful Queen Mary,"I really like the Queen Mary. It is a sight to behold. Lavishly decadent with old craftsmanship. Beautiful wood flooring, and so many nooks and crannies to explore. Grandeur in scale. Looking down from the top deck makes you appreciate just how humongous the ship really is. It is a nice, weeping view of Long Beach and the ocean from the top. Definitely an attraction to see if you have time and enjoy a little piece of history.",Ivan M
40,The Queen of the Seas,Great informative and interesting visit to this amazing ship.Our tour guide an old navy war veteran was absolutely fantastic. Obviously loved his work and really knew his stuff. Had some great tales about passengers and crew and told us the history of the Ship. Could have listened to him all day and been taken back to glamorous days of transatlantic travel.,SaxonA380
50,An amazing journey into the past.,"I have done this tour before and it still is an amazing journey into the past, You need several hours to fully appreciate the Queen, Take the guided tour into the history of her then do the self guided audio tour. The parking can be a bit hexy, but if you get your ticket validated on board it cuts it by half, bonus. Captain James was our tour guide, what a fun and hugely informative guy. Get the Go LA card and you'll save heaps..",John M
40,Take a walk on a old classic cruise ship with a lot of history.,Visit the Queen Mary if you want to walk back in time or if you love a nautical experience. I found this to be a fascinating visit.,Eric682014
50,Step back in Time,Loved going on the ship and taking the tour. We did not used the headsets as my husband was uncomfortable in leaving his driver's license with them. We all enjoyed the tour. My son and husband loved going to the engine room. Looks like we finally get to go on a cruise.,Trece95
40,Fun day,The tour guides were full of personality ( we did the Ghosts tour and the Haunted tour). I thoroughly enjoyed the history and information that was shared with us.,Kelly R
40,Interesting slice of history,Definitely well worth seeing. Our tour guide was chock full of good information about the history of this ship. I'd love to get back and actually spend a night or two in the hotel!,Rob H
50,Main point in LOng Beach,"I ended up not going inside because of the high prices for halloween, but just by looking from the city and pier is beautiful. I regret, so if you have an opportunity go inside, and look for the history about it. Awesome",EstelaAltoe
50,Beautiful Queen Mary,Experienced the Captain's Tour of the Queen Mary and thoroughly enjoyed it. It would be very interesting to stay in one of the hotel rooms aboard. Just standing in the ballroom and imagining the passengers from the past was breathtaking.,Jopohawk
50,Grand old queen still has IT,"Arriving by water taxi sure gives you a truly amazing impression of the Queen Mary's size and style.arriving in front of her to be met by a concierge felt odd. After paying for a tour we returned to the""front door"" to be shown the lift and given directions to the guide.After the obligatory photo shoot we set off on our 1 hour ghost tour. We were shown into many locked off areas and told many eerie stories.It is fantastic to see so much of the ship restored so beautifully!A great tour over a grand old lady of the sea",WayneR2233
40,A Step Back in Time,"We visited the Queen Mary a few times and wanted to spend more time looking into the history and enjoying the ship. This time we stayed 5 nights on the Queen Mary and it felt as though we stepped back in time and were a part of another era. A very elegant one. We took the guided ghost tour and then decided to do another self-guided tour ourselves. Both were very good and we saw a lot of the ship and heard many interesting stories. A few times during the night there seemed to be a few incidents that could've been a ghostly encounter, but I'm not sure I really believe it's haunted!",Lynne S
50,lovely experience would heartily recommend.,My children had a wonderful time.It was interesting to see the equipment used. They especially liked going up on the bridge where the captain used to be and enjoyed speaking to the radio room staff.,NYCMOMof4
50,Grand Dame of ships still impresses.,"If you are a history buff and like to take in an amazing brunch. Reserve your seats at the Sunday Champagne Brunch then amble about the ship to your heart's content. There is virtually no place you cannot go and it is like stepping back in time to the grand days of sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. The ships still has the ambiance of the days when royalty and those of high society lived their lives of luxury. There are guided tours of course, but I highly recommend the brunch then take your own time to enjoy the feel of the grand dame herself. After walking abut for some time, grab a spot of tea in the tea room for a upscale and relaxing experience.",GVWStonegate
40,A Royal Day on The Queen Mary,"You cannot just arrive at the Queen Mary & view the interior without purchasing tour tickets, staying at the hotel or having a reservation at one of the restaurants. We purchased the Royal Passport package with the self-guided audio tour & Princess Diana exhibit. We also had a reservation at The Tea Room. (Tip: by purchasing our tickets at the box office we received a AAA discount that is not available online.) We really enjoyed doing the self-guided tour as we could go at our own pace, stop & start & felt we saw everything we wanted to. We ran into some others that were on the guided tour & they felt they were rushed, couldn't keep up & missed things they wanted to see. If anyone in your party is disabled please note that there are some areas of this ship that are only reachable by a series of stairs such as the bridge, radio room, officer's quarters & engine room. The ship is beautiful & fascinating. There is so much history to it. We also loved seeing the engine room where they shot The Poseidon Adventure. Lunch at The Tea Room was delicious & relaxing with a great sea view. They serve full tea service & sandwiches & salads. There are quick bite options & multiple sit down restaurants. While some may only have or want to spend a few hours there, we spent the whole day & will return again.",FrontRowCenter
40,museum,"Humongous boat, was nice to visit this place during summer with the sun out and the history about this ship it was a pleasant surprise",abitibi21
30,Kind of a letdown,"My wife and I were bored this morning, so we decided to see one of the local attractions that we have never got around to seeing. We flipped a coin between The Queen Mary and the Aquarium of the Pacific. The Queen Mary won.The pros -- very friendly staff- ship is well kept for being nearly 80 years old- some very cool parts of the ship, such as the engine room and the captain's/engineer's/steward's rooms- beautiful and informative Princess Diana exhibit- outstanding views of downtown Long BeachThe cons -- not nearly enough exhibits and information regarding the ship. With the exception of the above mentioned exhibits, there is not a whole lot of information regarding the ship.- too many areas blocked off and/or closed for maintenance- expensive for what you get and the sister exhibit, which is a Russian submarine, was closed as wellOverall, it was a nice morning with my wife and son, but we all felt the aquarium would have been a better choice. The ship is a very cool piece of history that they could do so much more with.",Nick S
50,kids loved it,had some time before the cruise so rather then wait in a long line we took a tour. Kids had a blast and it was wonderful for them to learn all the history,Thess W
50,So much to explore!,"I took a tour in July; I ended up on the paranormal themed tour and surprisingly, I really enjoyed it! It was a fun way to explore the ship and hear more about its history. This seems like a good activity for families or couples or just by yourself. I appreciated that you are welcome to explore the ship after the tour and that the bar and restaurant area are open to the public. Kudos to Long Beach for doing such a nice job with the historic ship.",Megan R
50,Brunch of the Queen Mary,"On many occasions I have had Sunday Brunch on the Queen Mary and it is a wonderful experience, especiall since I am often by myself. I feel like travelling back in time and even after many visits I still find the ship fascinating. The harpist in the enormous dining room is enchanting.",Antonia Riley
20,Not Really Worth Your Money,This ship is a piece of history which is ok but it's not maintained well it needs to be renovated. I think this ship is really haunted because the way it looks if you want to get killed by a ghost come here.,Raju S
40,Queen Mary - Stately Old Lady of the Atlantic,"Well worth a visit if you are near Long Beach. This ""old lady of the oceans"" is very interesting and has been well preserved showing how the rich traveled during the mid 1900s.",qldflyer
40,Don't forget your walking shoes!,"Visiting the Queen Mary was a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday. I bought us tickets for the Haunted First-Class Passport online. Parking is $18. You can validate parking if you eat at the one the restaurants, but of course we forgot to do this! The first tour we did lasted half an hour and was the Ghost and Legends Tour. They take you to some of the most haunted locations and put on a little show. I kept waiting to see if characters would jump out at us but luckily that never happened. We then had drinks and food at the Observation Bar. Our second tour was an hour (Haunted Encounters). We then spent a lot of time walking all over the ship. It's a great place to visit at least once. The tour package was $31 a person and included the two tours, admission on the ship, submarine tour (submarine was closed), and an audio tour (we opted not to do this). I would like to go back and do some of the night tours.",Melinda W
40,A Little Slice of History,"We loved our stay aboard the Queen Mary. Yes, the walls are very thin and you can hear your neighbors and people in the hall very clearly. My wife was a little put off by the out-dated bathroom fixtures but I thought it was cool. I mean it's suppose to be old, isn't that the point? Our room was at least twice as large as what we had on our last Royal Caribbean cruise. We had a king bed, a nice sitting area and a TV that we didn't even turn on.We enjoyed the audio tour and got to see the Satin Dolls perform some WWII era songs and there was a fly over by some vintage aircraft. Enjoyable!We had dinner at Chelsea which was very good and later did one of the ghost tours which was a tad disappointing. We were in a large group and couldn't always hear what our guide was saying. The ghosts didn't cooperate either.All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful.Overall it was a great experience and we're glad we spent the night.",ABFine
40,So neat!,This exceeded my expectations. The hotel accommodations were can't likely likely wear when the ship was in use as the liner. The shops up on the next level where very touristy but the observation bar was beautiful. The princess Diana exhibit was very interesting with her dresses and memorabilia from throughout her life. I would've liked to have done the audio tour but I didn't have time. The staff was only so-so friendly but we only dealt with them a minimum amount of times. Didn't have any ghostly encounters and that's just fine by me!!!,Tierney D
50,A visit for your bucket list,"Take the audio tour to spend time exploring the ship. Great historical site, unique experience. Excellent meal at Chowders. Have an evening drink on the Observation deck for a nice view of Long Beach. However, our hotel room on board was disappointing for the price. Even though they were clean, the bedspread and carpet looked dismal. And the room was dark and dreary. (Might have been luck of the draw.)",Kay O
30,price hike,the mary used to be a good choice on what you would spend for the experiencenow the 30 and parking is just a little stiffthose who stay and do the whole adventure great but not a just visit anymore,Don M
50,Queen Mary,A really nice place to visti or stay. The ship is like going back in time to the 1930's. She is very clean and well maintained. Food is excellent as is the service. Parking is a bit expensive but the resturants will validate your parking ticket.,Scott M
50,Majestic and historical must-see!,"Even though modern cruise ships are much larger, the Queen Mary still has a larger than life personality when you are up close. The best part about this cruise ship is that you will never get sea sick. The registration desk is manned by a most courteous crew. They will check you in and help you with any question you have whether it's about the Queen Mary or surround Long Beach area. Walking down the hall to your room is just like being on a standard cruise ship with the almost infinite hallway to the bow and to the stern. The Queen Mary crew has done a fantastic job of keeping the ship just like it was back in the 1930's through the 1950's, from authentic polished wood paneling, original artwork, Art Deco style, and operable portholes.The Deluxe Stateroom (with either a king bed or two twin beds) was once the preferred choice for first-class travelers when the ship was in operation. Starboard side rooms have a view of Rainbow Harbor. Standard amenities include: operable portholes, 32"" LCD flat screen TV with satellite and Pay-Per-View movies, Wi-Fi, hairdryer, iron/ironing board, authentic Art Deco mirror and original built-in storage/closets. The bathroom, with its original fixtures, is much roomier than a standard cruise ship.After dinner, it was time to explore the ship. It's a great time to do some window shopping and get some great pictures without the crowds of tourists. As night fell, the fog started to roll in, providing that eerie, haunting feeling that many come to experience at the Queen Mary. From the sun deck, you can see the Rainbow Bridge in the harbor lit up as well as the Long Beach skyline.A foggy morning loomed over Long Beach, CA, as the sun tried its best to break through the marine layer. In order to get our day started, coffee was definitely needed to awaken our weary eyes. Midship Marketplace is located on the port side of the Promenade Deck. They served Starbucks coffee products along with pastries, bagels, breakfast sandwiches, yogurt parfaits, oatmeal, and more. Decorative accents like colors, design themes, and use of the Greek key pattern on the counter and floor tile pay homage to the former Midships Bar and Lounge located in this very space. Iced Caramel Macchiato, Mocha Frappuccino, strawberry danish, and blueberry muffin were on the menu for our light breakfast. We sat at a table right outside on the Promenade Deck and watch as the fog continued to roll in on the port side.After breakfast, it was time to take a walk outside on the Sun Deck. The marine layer was starting to burn off and the Long Beach skyline began to appear along with the marina, Parker's Lighthouse, and the Long Beach Convention Center with its oceanic mural of the Pacific Ocean. Juvenile sea gulls were taking in the view as well from the handrails. It was time to head back to the room for a little rest before our ship tour.Commodore Everette Hoard led our ship tour of the Queen Mary. The construction of the Queen Mary started in December 1930 at John Brown Shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland. After a delayed construction, due to the Great Depression, the R.M.S. Queen Mary launched on her maiden voyage on May 27, 1936. She became the most popular Atlantic liner of the late 1930s from Southampton, England to New York with a stop in Cherbourg, France. The ship was stocked with 50,000 pounds of meat, 20,000 pounds of poultry, 17,000 pounds of fish, 9,000 pounds of bacon and ham, 2,000 pounds of sausage, 14,500 bottles of wine, 20,000 bottles of beer, 6,000 gallons of draught, 4,000 pounds of coffee and tea, 25,000 packages of cigarettes, 5,000 cigars, 21,000 tablecloths, 91,000 napkins, 16,000 pieces of cutlery, 200,000 pieces of crockery, and 100,000 pieces of china and glassware.In March 1940, the Queen Mary was drafted as a troopship sailing around the globe delivering supplies and men during the course of World War II. Her service lasted six long years. In July 1947, the Queen Mary resumed passenger service along with the Queen Elizabeth.By the late 1960s, transatlantic liners were showing a great decline in passengers due to the increasing popularity of jet travel for intercontinental transportation. In May 1967, Cunard Lines announced that the Queen Mary would be retired and sold. The City of Long Beach submitted the highest bid of $3,450,000. She made her final 39-day journey from Southampton, England and arrived in Long Beach, CA on December 9, 1967. Construction began to convert the passenger liner into a floating hotel, tourist attraction, and a special events venue. The Queen Mary opened to the public in May 1971.On the Promenade Deck, above the Centerline Boutique, is a decorative Frieze; a highly sculpted band, plaster reinforced and pressure-wax treated to make it look like it was sculpted from ivory. It is just one of the modern examples of the Art Deco style found on the Queen Mary.So much more that I can't fit in this review! You'll have to check it out yourself! :)",OCFoodDiva
50,Real experience,"It is a day experience. There is so many things to discover on board and to learn.The Glory Day tour, Audio tours and the Haunted encounters are really worth the visit.Spending a night over there must be an awesome experience !",Diane P
40,Great Tour Guide,We enjoyed touring the ship on our own but wanted more so we purchased a guided tour. We had an outstanding guide who really made the experience come to life. His voice could go from high to low in great dramatic fashion as he took us back in time of the ships good old days. He made the day!!,TSCClovis_Ca_
50,LOVED THE QUEEN MARY,Just loved being able to get onboard.. to enjoy 'tea' FABULOUS FOOD and EXCELLENT service !!! DEVINE ;-),Mormongylpsymaomma
40,Nice hotel...,"... with very nice tours and atmosphere. Thin walls, you can here the neighbors, and no aircon (as it is an old ship...). Very nice staff.",Franzi M
50,Ghost Tour was fun!,"A group of girls went down to the Queen Mary for their ghost tour. It was a lot of fun, you get to see practically every part of the ship. Dinner was also delicious.",Nellie M
40,Only had lunch but very impressive,"Very impressive, met some friends here for lunch and it was superb, lots of people watching and relaxing, nice!",Haveadeal
50,Had an amazing time,"Visited two years ago but never stayed overnight. This time we did for two nights and what an amazing ship. I was worried as read a lot of negative feedback about it, but it is what it is, an old ship with history and not a 5* hotel. Service was excellent, room service the same and had a lovely evening meal aboard. Did the ghost tour as all tours were discounted for overnight stays. Hope one day to return.",AnnaMarie-Glos
50,Historic,Must see this beautiful vessel is part of history so is great fun to be part of it that keep it in great shape it is good time spent and the view is stunning,Casa Roa
50,Super interesting hotel,"Great hotel! You really feel immersed in 1936 when the ship made its first crossing to New York. It was amazing to see the ship be almost original to its time period. You can walk around the different decks and see and feel the history. The tours of the ship were great too! My mom and I did a Glory Days tour with James - he is phenomenal! This hotel is truly an experience.The rooms and bathrooms are old, but historical, and very comfortable. The food on ship is good, but very expensive. There is free city bus that comes directly to the Queen Mary and goes to the Shoreline Village (which is a great place to eat and walk around). The bus is great because there is no other food in the area, except on the ship or at Shoreline Village or the Pike.",Ashley W
50,Wear comfortable shoes!,"I used groupon to get the Passport tour which was supposed to include the Russian sub tour, but that exhibit was closed, even though you still have to pay full price for the passport, which should have been reduced while it was closed. Anyway, the passport also includes the historical tour, a theatrical ghost tour, the Princess Diana tour and the audio tour. We stayed at the Mary's hotel and I'm glad we didn't listen to the concierge, who told us that the audio tour (which you get for free anyway as a hotel guest) was pretty much useless since you could follow the marked map to see everything and it had placards explaining the same thing you hear on the audio. WRONG!The historical tour was very interesting, but much shorter than we expected. Some of the historical tour overlaps with the audio tour, but in the end both would be best to do if you can; more on the audio in a bit.The Princess Diana would have been better named The House of Windsor tour. Yes, there were some Princess Diana memorabilia, but she was not the primary focus. The whole family was the primary focus and most of that was on the Windsor women, except for a brief stint on Lady Bowles, which probably suits the Windors just fine.Housed there are letters from the Queen Consort Mary (not a real queen as Queen Elizabeth II is), the woman the ship is named for, her husband, her children, her grandchildren and even great-grandchildren, Princes William and Harry. There are newspaper articles, photographs, objects they've used, dresses the women (Diana and Kate) and even little Prince George has worn! I really am not a Princess Diana fan, but the letters and such were fascinating and who can't enjoy seeing children's clothing, especially that of a future king!To my surprise, the majority of the Diana visitors were British! I kid you not. I'm not sure if we visited on a special day for them, or something, but I was really surprised that most were British.There are two haunted tours. The passport provides you with the more cheesy theatrical tour. I mean, it was fun, and the guys cracked me up, but I really wanted the more historical haunted tour. Oh well, you can't win them all. The one benefit you get with the haunted tour is that you get to see one of the indoor pools that you never see on the other tours. Granted, you don't get to see it too well, but you get to see it.Finally, the audio tour was amazing! However, fair warning. The walking up and down the stairs the many MANY times required may not suit everyone. Definitely wear comfortable shoes and if you have trouble walking, it may suit you better to pick the places yourself.You can get a map of the ship at the front desk (or even at the official site too) that shows the stops the audio tour takes you to. There are signs that mark each stop by number. The audio tour has each stop recorded separately, so you can decide the best order for yourself to avoid going up and down the same stairs over and over again. Though if you do it this way, you may walk the length of the ship a number of times.Anyway, I cannot stress enough that if you do all tours in a single day, it's a lot of walking. Many of you won't have a problem, but us older folks and those not very fit may have problems.Oh and bring your own sack lunch. You can carry it around and there are plenty of tables to sit at along the decks and even a former lounge near the front desk of the A deck.",magnoliasouth
50,A great place to experience history beauty,The Queen Mary for years has been one of the places I took visitors. She is a beautiful ship and very interesting to explore. The history and exhibits and tours make for a great day. Cap it off with an expensive drink in the Observation Bar and the day is complete. The ship is so special to us that we got married on the Queen Mary. Having your wedding there is as good as it can get.,Bill G
30,Visited as a local,"We used a Groupon, which is the best deal for visiting. I wish it had helped with the parking though, as the parking price is obscene. With the Groupon, we got the audio tour and guided history tour, both of which were great, and the ghosts tour which, as expected, was very hokey. We only went on it because it was included in admission. The tour guide for the ghost tour was apathetic and the whole thing was ridiculous and boring. Waste of time.",AB4415
50,A must see!,Wonderful! We took both the Historical tour and the Ghosts and Legends tour. Both are very good. James was our tour guide for the Historical tour and he was great. Spent 6 hours on the ship and could have stayed longer. Make sure to go down to the engine room. You must go outside the ship to enter it. You can see the one propeller that is attached to the hull of the ship. You can get lunch onboard at the Cafe but it is expensive. Go to the small coffee shop on the promenade deck where you can get cheaper food.,JAW06098
20,A Royal Screw--Not Talkin' About the Engine or Propeller,"The City of Long Beach owns the QM, but leases it out to another company that runs the facility. $18 parking greets you for every drive in and out of the QM parking lot. Ouch! I was a day-guest. And, after having toured the ""free tour"" areas of the ship, I can honestly say I would not stay at the hotel under it's current ownership. The ship is in horrible condition. The maintenance crews, most-likely NOT marine maintenance crews, have done a slap-dash job of patching up glorious teak decks with T-111 plywood (cringe). The painting of the ship looks to have been done with a broom. The varnish-work on the railings dull, grainy and not prepped properly before successive coats of varnish have been applied. The deck furnishings are horrible. The bright-work on the inside of the ship is poorly maintained, and the outside bright-work forgotten long ago. The management company uses this ship as an event venue for numerous parking-lot festivals, and they offer a tour of the ship with each ticket sold to these events. The ship is, therefore, overrun with tour and event attendees. I was recently one of those event attendees who found out first-hand that the QM Management is problemmatic. Though I paid $200 for four tickets to a recent event that included what was represented as ""a tour of the ship,"" Management denied my party admittance to their guided tour; instead, we were offered the free self-guided tour. Ouch, again! If you are looking for a quiet, elegant, and upscale historic experience, the QM is not for you.",Karen7275
40,Several options make sure you get the most suitable,"We had several options as well as the self guided tour. Now if you want to do several options be aware of time. The self guided tour was excellent but took us nearly 2 hours, we really enjoyed it and were very surprised at it in terms of length and quality. The additional options of a history tour and ghost tour I am sure will be just as good.The sting in the tail is the 18 dollars car park, use the passport free bus if you can.",joep735
40,A piece of history!,We got a free self guided audio tour of this wonderful ship as part of our stay onboard for 2 nights recently. The hand held interactive unit is brilliant and it takes you to every corner of the ship including the engine room and propeller. The ship does however need some TLC to keep her in the condition she deserves...the paint on the hull is very poor and some of the decks need attention.,ggm_devon
40,As close as the Titanic you can experience.,"Amazing ship. The guided tour is for kids, based on a phantoms story. Better get the self guided tour, and explore the innards of this epoch liner, feel like the Titanic.",MaxMotoring V
40,Buy a ticket on Groupon,"We were hesitant because we were afraid it wouldn't be worth the price and the parking fee. While in line we quickly found a great deal on Groupon. We had a ticket for the history tour, ghost tour and Princess Diana walk through area. We really enjoyed everything! Unlike other reviews, I found the employees to be friendly, informative and helpful.",We-Eat-And-Travel93
50,very fun historic place,this is a great place to go on a date to have a drink up on the top the views are great and its a really neat place to see.,ceford
40,The ghost of Old style luxury,"We were here over the holidays, which was great as they have a huge tent set up next door with ice rink and snowland/fairlyland/northpole. WE also spent the night on board which is a one of kind deal, so we blew some bucks. All in all very glad we went as it made a nice holiday memory. It is pricey however, so not something I'd do over and over again, but still very nice experience and lovely rooms of old, though the ice feature can be done without spending the night on board.. but.. overall glad we did both.. and they often have special deals if you buy both at the same time.",sayyestolife
30,Nice ship But Terrible Service,"I was really disappointed in the works at queen mary as the workers at the ticket desk were very very rude. I did however enjoy walking around the ship on my own. We were going to do the history tour of the ship because the ghost tour tickets were sold out. The history tour was a joke, the tour guide had a bland personality and the tour itself was dumb. So we left that to go see if we could swap our tickets for the ghost tour because the tour guide didn't even check to see who even had a ticket! Random people were going into our tour at first. The lady at the desk was super rude her first comment was ""WEREN'T YOU JUST HERE FOR HELP"" in a rude rude voice and then she blamed us for the tour not being good and for buying the wrong ticket. I made a vlog video for my youtube channel about the tour if you want to check it out it will be up soon my channel is Lyssy Noel on youtube. But i mean she ship itself is nice and all but the audio tour, and history tour aren't worth your money. I'm not sure about the ghost tour. I suggest if you're going to go on this ship to just really walk around on your own instead of buying a tour ! Also the workers at the restaurant are super nice and the food was good :)",Lyssy N
30,A beautiful ship sadly run down,"This is clearly a wonderful ship with lots of history, and to make it accessible as a sort of museum is a nice idea, but unfortunately the reality does not quite match the hype. While the elegance of the structure can still be experienced and enjoyed the somewhat cheap fast-food atmosphere of the place is hard to overlook. More like a Coney Island ""attraction"" than a classy ocean liner.",Hamburgguy47
10,Avoid July 4th on the Queen Mary,"I bought three VIP tickets ($300) to the July 4th celebration and was extremely disappointed. The VIP tickets provided no additional value that I could tell - All we did was walk around the ship which was interesting, but we could have paid $20 each for that privilege. We couldn't get a seat at the restaurant and when I asked if there we other choices, I was told no. So I was surprised to find a booth selling bad fried chicken, which was was extremely overpriced. In addition, there were no chairs anywhere. No place to sit, so after we walked around the ship for about 30 minutes, that was it - we left. It was disorganized and I felt like I was attending some cheap, smelly country fair with bad food, no service and stinky air due to the enormous grill on the boardwalk outside the ship. Come on people, this was amateur hour for which we were charged $300.",JoanIrvington
40,nice restoration,Was here for a reception in the main ballroom. Lovely room with nice furnishings and décor. Food was great too.,qallisong
30,"Unfriendly staff, awesome ship",I am a tourist and I expect people to be helpful. The staff was not. The ship is amazing on her own..recommend the self tour where you can wander on your own. You see more than the tour which was painfully slow to me.,Maureen P
50,The Queen Mary,Loved being able to spend a few days on The Queen Mary and to look around the ship and see the workings of the ship. The view from the ship was awesome. So glad I was able to take advantage of being on this historic ship.,Jerry1128
50,The Queen Mary,We were keen to see this ship and we were not disappointed. We made an early start and had lovely tea and scones to begin with. We toured around the ship and saw everything that was available to see. To round off our visit we enjoyed cocktails in the Art Deco Bar,littlemillie
50,Must to stay overnight,"This is the way to go, if you are visiting the Queen Mary, staying on the ship. Wow, what a great experience. I have now stayed on the queen twice, and it is definitely a nice time. So much to see , so many places to hang and chill. There is also a free bus shuttle to the shoreline village, and in the summer time, a boat shuttle for $1.00 /person. The ship is pretty much original, which is way cool. just think, one day people use to sail on this Majesty. Amazing!",taminica
50,The Queen Mary Review,"I was there for dinner but took a personal tour of the accessible areas, lots of history in a big boat. Recommend to go if you are in the Long Beach, CA area.",aghyba

40,Fun!,"This ship was a fun time! We chose to just walk around by ourselves & boy was it spooky! We loved the whole ""haunted"" feel of it!",Madyson P
40,Back in Time,I was visiting my brother who lives in Long Beach and wanted to go to the Queen Mary for High Tea. The staff was very accommodating and responded pleasantly to my sister-in-law's request for a change in her order ..forget what the change was..Could definitely be a romantic afternoon. Walking around the ship was enjoyable and free.Nice afternoon trip at a slow pace,Redtupelo
30,"Interesting History, Outrageous Cost","This ship is undoubtedly a piece of nautical history and worth consideration if you are in the area. I had an interesting guided tour by a very knowledgable tour guide. After the tour ended we had open access to the different areas of the ship, including the engine room, which was extremely cool.My main complaint is the cost. The tour's list price is over $30/person and parking is $18, which is highway robbery for a couple hours considering you're paying for admission to the attraction. I'm glad I saw it but I wouldn't do it again.",Mike Kowalczyk
30,Quaint Queen,Much better 10 years ago. Good. Interesting. Needs money spent on it in order to maintain iconic status. Needs a good paint job on the outside.,Nathalie E
50,Historic ship did not disappoint.,"The Queen Mary is an historic, grand ship used for both pleasure and during WW1 as a wartime ship. My husband & I dined in the Churchill Restaurant while visiting Long Beach California. The food was exceptional with attentive wait staff. The view of the harbor, water, other boats coming and going was lovely. The restaurant had a Old World historical décor and very elegant. I wished we had arrived earlier in the day to allow more time to tour this grand old ship.",gapeach1027
50,Queen Mary in Long Beach Ca.,The Queen Mary is truly magnificent! We took the self guided tour and it took 2 hours. There are several tours to choose from. I was most inspired by all the original wood and the smoke stacks. The pictures they took were very cute but a little pricey of course. We went on a Wednesday and it was not crowded. My only regret was that we didn't get there earlier to rest between flights of stairs. Check Groupon also.,Sandra P
40,Lots of cool history,"If your into history or seeing what it was like to travel in the early 1900, then this is a cool place! The craftsmanship is awesome. They just don't make things like her anymore. Cool ship and cool tours, I would like to come back and stay at the hotel. Bar is really cool, parking is expensive, not sure why they need to charge you, you are going to pay for the tour, so you should park for free.",John L
50,Museum On Water!!!,"I don’t know if am scared of ships or what but when I saw “The Queen Mary” as a museum, I said I must do the tour. Its all interesting inside and they kept it in the original shape.You can admire from the rooms until the machine storage. Also they have 1 or 2 walk around groups about ghost and facts that happened back in the days on board.You can walk around by yourself if you want to take some good pictures and also part of the ship is a real hotel where you can stay over the night. The fee is really affordable and I suggest to visit it if you are in Long Beach, CA.",Deviljho Black
50,Queen Mary visit,"Excellent visit, had dinner aboard the Queen Mary everything was perfect !Very historical would come back again !",Misty K
50,A Long Beach Must Do,This is a must visit for all. The ship takes you back in history. The beauty of the ship is amazing.Make sure to take the tours. They are really worth the money. This is a must visit for visitors of all ages.,Valerie R
40,Bring your gloves!,"We bought tickets through Gold Star. What a deal. Totally worth $13.95. I don't know if I would have paid the $20 per adult. PLUS $20 to park. If you are gonna pay $20 to park, you should make a day of it and also visit the Queen Mary and eat lunch on the ship.As for the actual event. 4 stars! My son (7) loved it. We didn't upgrade for the tubing or ice skating. He was happy with the slide that was inside the dome. My daughter (3) did NOT like the cold at all.Pros:- Super cool ice art! Colored ice and lights inside each sculpture- 2 Free ice slides inside the dome.- lots of cool set ups for pictures- they have parkas for you, Adult XL - Child XS- Every year is a different theme/storyCons:- regular door price is $$-Parking is $20- outside food and activities are extra and $$TIPS:* Gloves are a MUST* Do NOT wear flip flops, sandals, heals , or any open toed shoes* Cover up. You don't want too much of the parka touching your bare skin. Who knows how many people have been wearing it.* Wear Pants* Try and come early in the day (opens at 10am)* Bundle up the little ones: hat that covers their ears, mittens, scarf to cover their face and neckWe have gone 3 times, and we will probably go more!",Tuesday T
40,historical treat,"Started with brunch, then went on tour given by an ""experienced"" Captain. The tales he shared injected life into the historical facts. Enjoyed going back in time!",Virginia F
40,Great attraction and pretty unique!,"Visited here late afternoon early evening and it was a great time to go - no crowds, had the ship pretty much to myself (apart from the hotel guests of course!). Well worth the admission fee - I would thoroughly recommend you spend a couple of hours wandering round this old lady. An amazing slice of history!",777pj777
50,"Romantic stay, great views, amazing piece of history","We stayed overnight, and had a room where the portholes looked out over the port/Long Beach. What a view! The self guided tour is a must. It will easily take a few hours, esp. if you read all there is. It is quite an amazing story, and very interesting. We didn't eat on board, but there are several different restaurants (which looked great), although most require reservations. You can drop a fair amount of cash here, but for a special night, it'd be worth it.One caveat - while there are elevators, they are not easily accessible to all areas of the ship. If you are not able to take stairs (wheelchair or stroller), you may find it difficult to access all areas of the tour.",dgfurman
20,Disappointing,"We decided to visit the Queen Mary as my daughters a fascinated with the Titanic. We thought they would enjoy seeing an old fashion historical Ocean liner.My family and I visited the Queen Mary on June 26, 2015. We purchased the basic tour that included the self guided tour and one additional one. We choose the haunted tour. My family consisted of my husband and I plus our 3 daughters ages 9, 9, and 7. Our first disappointment was to find out there were no headsets available. We were told to check back in an hour and go on ahead and explore. The ladies handling these headsets, didn't seem to care that they were out. When we came back in an hour, luckily we were able to get the headsets. What a difference in the tour. We enjoyed the information and learned a lot. Without these headsets, wandering the ship is useless.Our second disappointment was in the haunted tour. It was too scary for our girls. I wish the person who sold the tickets would of advised us. (Considering we purchased 3 tickets for children and were asked the ages, some advice would of been appreciated.. other than it is ok) We had know idea what we were getting ourselves into.There are many areas of the ship that are discussed on the audio tapes that you can't get too such as the pool or ball room. It would of been great to see these. Parking was pricey and overall the tickets for 5 was $115. In hind sight, we would of skipped this.Oh... when you go to pick up your headsets, they want you to take a picture and then try to sell you a very expensive package.There is a ""Starbucks"" snack bar with over priced snacks. I don't believe they offered a full ""Starbucks"" menu.Very disappointing. Wish we had skipped this tour.",Victoria S
50,Love the QUEEN MARY,"I have been there 4 times and counting. What a wonderful trip thru history. It is so beautiful. I love the restaurant...so beautiful at sunset and the food amazing. Most importantly, I love the ghost tours...what fun! It truly is a beautiful, educational and just delightful experience...not to be missed!",magsterky
40,Great western terrier dog show,Great place to stay - so convenient - lost of history - such a great bus (free) to take you into long beach - staff very accommodating - Starbucks on the ship for morning coffee .. Not a luxury hotel but a unique experience -- lots of different size rooms for any number in party !!! Thank you for a bother memorable stay !,Pamlowe
30,Good if You Have Never Seen It,"A visit to Long Beach with some friends started with checking out the Queen Mary via the internet. The website is very “Madison Avenue,” touting assorted tours and events but it’s really designed to set up a room reservation to stay in the on board hotel.The tour descriptions have enticing names and not much else. Lots of ‘haunted’ or ‘ghost’ themed options. We were looking for a more informative historic tour, but I was unable to tell from the website exactly what tour went where. The website is not helpful in deciding which tour will actually cover the things you really want to see.The website also included prices for the various tours, which turned out to be just an approximate number. More on that later.Finding the ship was not hard, signs direct you from the 710 freeway right into the parking area for the Queen Mary and the Soviet submarine docked directly adjacent to her. Signs announcing a $15 parking fee were placed on the automated ticket device that opens the gate to allow you to enter the lot, but we were charged $18 AFTER a “partial validation” given at one of the restaurants on board.The day we toured the ship, the “Passport” we purchased was to include the Soviet submarine as well, but it was not available for viewing so we were given admission to the Princess Diana exhibit instead. Small signs taped to the ticket sales windows announced a $2 fee for all ticket purchases, so the $31 ticket price given on the website grew to $32 - the posted price for the tickets at the Queen Mary, plus the $2 fee and taxes. We spent $70 for two tickets that included two tours (and the Princess Diana exhibit).I don't really mind the price so much as the nettling little bumps and additions along the way. Very bush league. Incidentally, there is no way to purchase admission to the ship without purchasing at least one tour or exhibit. You can’t just get on board and stroll around (well, actually you can, but you have paid for a guided tour for the privilege).The ship itself is nicely preserved and - in as much as possible - nicely taken care of despite the salt air and constant tourist traffic. There is a nostalgic sense of time standing still amid all the art deco glass and fine woodwork. A nice set of cutaway scale models depicting historic sunken vessels - the Lusitania, the Normandy and the Titanic - along with some scale replicas of other Cunard vessels, lines one forward corridor. There is also a replica of the ship created entirely from Lego building blocks - not something that we choose to investigate.After some aimless wandering, we checked in for our tour (we skipped the haunted tour and opted for the tour titled ‘Glory Days’) The check in area is amidship in the ‘Main Hall’. We found people queuing up here with puzzled looks holding the tickets that they were sold on the dock. A group of kids behind some desks were scanning the tickets and directing people to have their picture taken against a background for later purchase. Our tickets would not scan, and the attendant just told us to go get in line at the holding area. We skipped the photo.We joined about fifteen other people and a guide who walked us about the ship in largely the public spaces (hotel guests and those not on tours are weaving in and out of the areas you are viewing with your guide). From time to time, he opened a door and allowed us into some non-public areas, all the while sharing tidbits of history and factual information about the ship and it’s history. He was very knowledgable and encouraged questions, delivering a polished presentation with humor and skill.All in all, the walking tour lasted about forty five minutes. We enjoyed ourselves on the tour and picked up some details about the ship and it’s fascinating history, but we will probably not return to the Queen Mary for some time to come. It’s just not worth it.Two people purchasing a couple of tours and parking could rack up about $100 for a couple of hours of entertainment. I hold the opinion that this attraction lacks value and is deceptive in it’s approach. I should mention that I have viewed the ship a few times over the years since it’s opening in Long Beach back in nineteen sixty nine. It is still basically the same - which is good. I am put off by the goofy ticket pricing - not being able to really know where the tours are gong - and the Barnum and Bailey marketing stance intended to draw people in to see something “new.” I think they should look up the definition of “historic.”",John C
40,A lot of history,Very. Interesting historic place said to be haunted but I never seeing anything out of the ordinary if you are in long beach go to se it,VictoriaD2

50,History,"It is history, it reminds us of how crossing the oceans used to be. It will be good to always bring your children to see history in reality.",WWglobal
50,"Good breakfast, interesting history","We went there with a group of 9 people for brunch, before 8 of us left on a cruise. We enjoyed the food and got to see the ship models, gift shop, and much of the ship before we left for our cruise. A great experience! Loved the July Fourth decor when we returned!!!",Lynn498
40,"A grand ol ship, take her as you see her..a piece of history","As we have sailed on the Queen Mary ll, we thought it fitting to take a drive down to Long Beach while we were staying in Anaheim to see The Queen Mary. Once we actually found how to get to where the attraction was located it was alright but that took a bit of driving around as the signage wasn't great. We did a tour combo package of Haunted Encounters followed by the Ghosts and Legends tour. If you got over the corniness of the tours there was a lot of cool history and each tour took you in different areas of the ship. I enjoyed getting a feel for what the ship would have been like in its heyday with all the beautiful wood that was used and the way it was fitted out. Give yourself time to walk through the whole ship as well as the exhibits as it is quite an interesting piece of history. Some say she looks a bit old but she is, so take her as you see her... an admire her as an interesting piece of history. An added note if you are planning to see The Diana Exhibit keep in mind that it there is a cost and is not included in the tours that are offered. Guess I didn't research enough before going so prepared I was not prepared to pay more money although I understand it is very good as well as it not only contains some of Diana's things but a good deal about the Royal family as well. Once you have finished your tour of the Queen the Russian Scorpion submarine is worth a walk through.",LAURA MAE K
40,Great nostalgic evening,"This is a brilliant evening out. Refined dining, food was great, wines excellent. Go early to have a look around the ship. We went to Winstons Restaurant on the top sun deck. Views were brilliant.Waiter service is good, food was served quickly. And no complaints from us at all.",Beachbabe38
10,An Iconic Attraction ruined by an Aweful Tour Guide,"My family of 4 looked forward to visiting the Queen Mary and Scorpion submarine as part of our SoCal vacation. Years earlier my wife had taken this tour and had fond memories. However when we arrived at 9:45, the ticket booth was closed until 10:00 when the attraction opens (why no pre-sales???). We also learned the Soviet submarine was closed (no reason given, but based on the listing and constant water being pumped out, it’s no surprise in hindsight). So after walking around the Queen Mary for an hour (enjoyable to explore the main deck on our own and view the ship models), it was time for our first tour.As often is the case, a tour guide can make all the difference… and James made a poor situation unbearable! He thought people would be entertained by his cadence and style of speaking. It was a strange mash-up of Morgan Freeman, Steven A. Smith and Dr. Suess that served no purpose and had no relation to the history of the Queen Mary. In short – IT WAS AWEFUL!!!!! My wife dropped out after 5 minutes, my 10 year old shortly after. They listened in with a later tour and learned more in 15 minutes than I did in 75 minutes with James.It was so disappointing (and there didn’t appear to be anything else to do) that we left right away. There is a better way to spend your time and money in SoCal (family of 4 = $150+ after fees and parking). Don’t take the chance that James wastes your time.",Jeff E
30,4th of july!,Went for the small fest they put on for the 4th not a lot of things for the kids food was great and the view amazing we loved the nostalgic ship patina and all its quite a sight you really step back in time walking thru its corridors the best part of the trip was the fireworks display best seat in the house kids loved it,julio_valdez83
10,Dirty and Disappointing,"I visited the Queen Mary back in 1990 and my memory is of a tourist attraction steeped in history, how things have changed. It is now more of a location for 'events' rather than event itself. The directions on the audio guide were poor but at least the commentary was interesting. The Ghost Tour was hilarious....I laughingly asked my wife when she thought the hull would begin to leak.... yep... 2 minutes later the hull began to leak!The key eye-catching items in the wheelhouse were the empty fast-food cups and containers on the surfaces and floor. I mentioned this to a number of staff who were disinterested and made excuses. We asked for a Customer Satisfaction Questionnaire, of course they have no such thing.... The old adage remains.... 'No questionnaire...No care'.I had wanted to visit the Scorpion Soviet Submarine.... It was closed.... Independence Day weekend.... Sunday 5 July and part of a major attraction is closed for the day!!The visit was neither worth the time nor the money. The old girl is clearly unloved and a vehicle for quick money grabbing. Steer clear. Go to Hearst Castle near San Simeon up the coast, tourism how it should be done.Not sure what Diana has to do with the Queen Mary..... Cult of celebrity I guess.Really sorry I returned after 25 years, to such a disappointment. A sad and neglected ship.",Dinks60
50,Step back in time,"I fell in love with the Queen Mary as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. Though she needs some tender loving care, our stay on the ship was memorable. We toured the ship and enjoyed hearing the tales and stories of the Queen Mary's past, of the celebrities that sailed upon her, and the ghosts rumored to haunt the majestic ship. We stayed the night on the ship. The room was larger than I'd expected with amenities we are used to having. I enjoyed my stay on board and the experience of a paranormal tour into the depths of the ship. I would go back again.",LissaJx619
30,A little bit of nostalgia,The Queen Mary is a nice ship to visit but entry is quite expensive which would have been fine if the headsets had worked and signage had been better. One of the staff directed us to the bridge which is well worth a look but I doubt if we'd have found it without guidance. A little disappointed!,Kathryn G
20,Bad Hotel. Bad customer service . Bad stay and we will not return,"wow! I was surprised. You would think this was the greatest hotel in the world, Wrong. The rooms were hard to find . way to much walking, our toilet seat was missing the lights were hanging off the wall the ice machine was not working. And when we complained at the front desk we still could NOT get any service. BAD STAY and we will NOT return again. We expected better from a Disneyland affiliate",poeskeconstruction
40,DIANA LEGACY OF A PRINCESS EXHIBIT AT THE QUEEN MARY,"The late Princess Diana defined a generation, and I visited the DIANA LEGACY OF A PRINCESS at the Queen Mary today. If you admired this lady, be sure to visit the exhibit before it ends. It's well worth your time.I hadn't been to the QUEEN MARY in years so I was up for an adventure. The Queen Mary regularly has exhibitions so it was great to have a chance to see Princess Diana Memorabilia.I saw on their website that parking was $18 so I took the metro to Long Beach and took the free Passport bus to the Queen Mary. The ticket line was long and slow moving. I think people had problems deciding one which ticket option to buy--The First Class Tour, The Royal Tour, the combo ticket with the submarine or the USS IOWA and so on.It wasn't clear where the entrance was. The entrance I found I thought might only be to the hotel. I walked a few steps to my right and a man rushed over to me warning me ""this is a restricted area."" I had entered ""restricted airspace"" yet so his comment took me aback and actually put me on edge for the rest of my visit. I was steps away from the entrance so he could have politely asked if I was looking for the entrance. what is top secret at the Queen Mary that it has restricted areas (rather than closed to the public areas)My next problem was finding the Princess Diana Exhibit. Signage is poor. I was told to go to Level 4 and take the stairs up. Really, anytime I saw someone in a hallway, I wondered if that was a restricted area. The location was not clear but I did find the exhibit.The exhibit is an Anglophile's dream as a good portion of the exhibit is really dealing with British royalty of the 20th Century. Learn about the monarchy after Queen Victoria. A great deal concentrated on coronations and the various royal weddings of the children of Queen Elizabeth. It was truly a remarkable journey. A major problem was there just was too much to see and again signage was poor. Not all items were marked and many things were on the bottom shelves of display cases making them hard to see. I ended up spending an hour watching a video explaining the planning of the weddings of Charles and Diana and Andrew and Sarah along with Elizabeth's marriage to Phillip. Her parents' marriage and the marriage of her daughter Anne.The exhibit continued on into several rooms and finally several of Diana's gowns were on display. The displays were not marked or numbered but you could get a large laminated sheet and try to match the dress in the picture with the dress on display. It was not a convenient way to organize an exhibition but it was fascinating.I saw so much Diana memorabilia and was disappointed that the gift shop didn't have much on Diana beyond books and some pricey knick-knacks. A big disappointment on that level.I spent so much time at the exhibit that I did not have time to get the audio tour for the ship. I decided to walk around with out the audio tour. The map included in the brochure was not easy to follow. I wanted to get a drink and a snack but there only appeared to be fine dining, One restaurant named after Winston Churchill had $48 entrees!As far as the QUEEN MARY is concerned, it is a lovely piece of history. You'll feel like you are back in the liner's heyday of the 1930's and 1940's. It has a feel of history to it and the views of Long Beach and the harbor are stunning. This may not be a great place for kids unless they have an interest in history. It's very much a step back in time.There are shops on the 4th level. Again, not as a I remembered when there were some British shops like Harrod's. It's worth a visit if you are a history buff.",Jackbear
40,Ocean liner the way it used to be,"We went for the Diana Exhibit, which is really Edward VII through the present. Takes about two hours. Admission to the Diana Exhibit includes the self-guided tour. (Extra for guided tour.) The Diana exhibit includes dresses, newspaper articles, pictures and various artifacts. Most interesting (and sad) was her hair dressing schedule for one month. That hair did not do itself.The tour of the ship is interesting. Used as a troop ship in WWII, and there are lots of remembrances about that.",SoCalTraveler91356
40,Still looking for ghosts,"I love the Queen Mary. We try to get there every few years for a staycation. It's close to home, but feels like a million miles away. The walls in the rooms are thin. The restaurants are very good. We love the brunch in the Grand Ballroom. The self guided tour lets you explore the ship at your own pace.We're still looking for ghosts.",Rhonda K
40,Impressive History,"My boyfriend and I visited the Queen Mary on a day off. He's a big fan of the paranormal, so we got the Haunted First Class Passport tour package.It started with the ""Ghosts and Legends"" tour. This tour is basically a 1/2 hour walk through a ""haunted house"" inside the ship. It's not very scary at all, totally safe for little kids and such. You've got two tour guides (who are also actors) taking you through a few of the supposedly haunted areas of the ship like the 1st class swimming pool and the boiler room. There are moments of almost complete darkness, some strobe lights, and some special effects. It was a fun way to spend 1/2 hour :)After that we'd hoped to eat at the Chowder House, but it was closed...open for dinner only, oops!. So we went to the Promenade Cafe. This was a good restaurant, lots of floor space, nice views, casual, great for families. And the food was delicious, nothing fancy, just good food.Then we picked up our audio packs for the self-guided tour. For those who are not tech-savvy, be sure to listen to the Introduction to learn how to use your device. You will need to know how to pause, ask for repeated directions, or skip ahead to another tour section. Trust me. The ship is very large, and sometimes there was a long way to go between points-of-interest.We explored everything from the top deck down to the propeller below the water line. We're both fairly healthy/average, and visiting all 21 points on tour took us about 2.5 hours.The audio features interviews with people who worked on the ship, wartime passengers, and Holocaust survivors. These personal stories were, IMO, the best part of the tour. They made us realize the significance of this ship and her history.We ended our day with the Haunted Encounters tour. This tour focused on specific paranormal events that had taken place on the ship: the ""personalities"" of the ghosts, the locations of sightings and other encounters, and also some history regarding the many deaths that occurred on the ship. You get to see some really interesting places that are ""off the beaten path"", such as the hold, the prow, and one of the supposedly haunted hotel rooms. For that reason I'd really recommend this tour even if you're not into supernatural stuff.Overall we had a great time. I've given 4/5 because some parts of the self-guided tour were not well-marked, and because of that we had to backtrack several times because we got lost. Also I think that the Queen Mary is currently more hotel/conference/event center than museum. I know they're trying to get funding for some repairs and a museum makeover, and I hope they're able to pull it off because the ship is definitely worth saving and deserves a more engaging, streamlined presentation of her history.If you're in Long Beach, this is a must see!",Megan O
40,"Superb chance to ""stay"" in history.","Our stateroom was roomy and quiet. The vessel itself was of great interest offering haunted tours, self-directed tours and a Princess of Wales exhibition [Princess Diana]. Ensure you have ample time to take in this wonderful place.",Garry T
20,Meh...,"This place was not the best use of time or money. We took the self guided audio tour and spent way too much time getting lost and backtracking due to lack of signage. The staff was all business like, not very personable. The area where you check out and return the audio equipment was way too small. Customers were bumping into each other and shuffling around. The ship itself is a little shabby, which is disappointing considering her history. We also took a guides tour which gained us access to some areas not on the self guided tour. The tour guide was 5 minutes late to start the tour even though we were instructed to arrive 10 minutes early. Overall it was a disappointing experience... And the topper was we were charged $18 for parking...ouch! Will not be back and will probably not recommend this attraction to friends.",D_Kudlo
20,Down and out in Long Beach,This old lady has seen better days. Maybe it's the salt air but seriously she needs a makeover in a big way.,CruiserDeluxe
50,Queen Mary Adventure,We held a conference on the ship and I can not explain how supportive and gracious the cater/event planners (Valle and Mandy) were. Their entire crew made us feel like royalty and took care of so many little details to make our event a success. Everyone loved hearing the Captain tell us about the history of the ship and how she came to be in Long Beach. We didn't want to leave! Maybe I'll come back and live there after I leave this earth with some of the other eternal passengers...,allyd1961
50,Luxury from a bygone era,"What can you say about a ""must do - once in a lifetime experience""? However if you are looking for current day 5 star luxury then look elsewhere BUT if you want to know what luxury was like in yesteryear - then you've gotta go!!Whether it's top tour the ship, stay the night, eat in a fine dining restaurant or even have a group celebration - this former ""Queen of the Seas"" can provide it all for you.",Gus S
10,Awful,"I'm grateful this tour was included as part of a groupon as I'd have been pretty bummed paying full price.Lame is probably the best word to describe this 'tour'. The tour is 30 mins. 10 mins of this is watching a video. We were then led to the swimming pool where they played some spooky music, flashed some lights and then for the scariest part of all they flickered a light in what looked like the changing area off the pool.Then off to the boiler room with a few fake cobwebs hanging from ceiling. Our guides pretended the elevator was broken and pretended to have a discussion which was as fake as their ghosts. The boiler room was dark so we saw nothing but I did feel a blast of air on my legs which I think was meant to be spooky.Prior to starting the tour they warned of loud noises. The loud noises were the guide closing the door and the guide raising his voice in an attempt to shock us.It's such a pity as they have everything they need to make this a good tour but it lacks any atmosphere or professionalism.If you get a groupon why not but otherwise I'd probably give it a miss.",Sharon R
50,"Queen Mary, interesting and educational",My wife and I had a chance to see this exhibit while on a business trip in the area. I am very happy we took the time to see this piece of history. Amazing what this ship went through in her history. The restaurant was very good for lunch.Worth the time.,Ken T
40,It depends....,"Bear with me.This was our first stop in Long Beach...we just HAD to come here...mostly because I am a Royal Family Junkie (I admit it) and was drawn to the Diana exhibit. I assured my husband we would see the rest of the boat, so he came along for the ride.I am not one of those that likes to go on a walking tour with the group. One, I'm short, and I never can see everything. Two, I swear I have ADD, and I get fidgety three minutes into a stop. Get the tour guide talking about something I could care less about and I go nuts...so I purchase the audio tour.Wait, let me go in order.We did the Diana exhibit. Now, I appreciate them calling it that as there is a large Diana exhibit - dresses, personal effects, and the like, but it is very important to note that it is actually a whole Royal Family exhibit from Queen Mary downwards to today. Personal effects, souvenirs, letters, newspapers...not the typical museum stuff. Pieces of wedding cake from royal weddings! Crazy stuff....even my husband who just ""came along"" truly enjoyed the ""Diana"" exhibit.Then we picked up the audio tour headsets. Talk about post tour euphoria crashing and burning. Now, my husband and I aren't stupid people....but honestly, we couldn't get past stop 3 on the audio tour. The map is minimal, so you have to rely on the audio directions, which of course refer to starboard, aft, port..and honestly, by then you have no idea where the front of the ship is, where is starboard, and where is the sign that says stop 3....oh, we just gave up and explored on our own. I'm sure we missed stuff, but medication needs to be offered for those people taking the audio tour.",drpclarke
20,Very Costly to Visit,We turned around after discovering that a basis self-guided tour would cost $32 per person. The ship is desperately in need of a paint job.,Avatar888
40,A great experience. Bring your own WIFI hotspot,"I highly recommend this hotel mainly because of the vibe. This is a piece of history, and it feels like something right out of the movie Titanic. The price for the rooms were quite reasonable, but I dont like paying $14 a day for WIFI",Percy J
40,Nice day of Fun in the Sun,"The ship is large for the ""olden"" days. I love the pictures they have up from its heydays. There are nice places to eat and drink as you wander around and daydream of what it must have been like to sail on her. We have never stayed overnight in the rooms, but you don't need to, to enjoy the boat and area.",xiggyx
50,Beautiful ship,Make sure to do the ghost tour. Have a flashlight on your phone for the boiler room. The flash on my phone was not strong enough to take a picture of the haunted pool room.,tahoe-mom
50,Not your typical hotel stay ....,"We spend the night onboard with my mother and two teenage girls. It was fun. There was a ghost tour (that the kids loved) and dinner was excellent. Our suite was not a rehabbed room and it had very thin walls. My mother's room was in a ""new"" room and they didn't have that problem. All in all, for a hotel stay, it was comfortable, reasonably priced and different :)",chicachiquita
50,Great family afternoon,A great step back in time.This is fun and informative. It is quite a walk though so brig your energy.Kids and parents alike are drawn to the Queen Mary. Looking at times past and dreaming of being part of it.,MrsO_5

50,HOPE TO RETURN!,"My late husband and I stayed aboard THE QUEEN MARY. What an experience! This was a few years back, but I have nothing but pleasant memories of our wonderful night.",tigilau
50,A nod to the Queen,"This ship is larger than life! I never understood the fascination with her, but we spent some time investigating her. It is maintained as a historical icon and is beautiful. You can almost hear the music and see the history unfold on her decks. A must-see!",FatandSassy
50,Majestic Lady of the Ocean,"Great concept accommodation, with excellent maritime history. The self guided tour is a must, especially for nautica buffs. The Art Deco Bar is a marvellous reminder of an elegant time for ocean liners.",JillyatSea
40,An old lady of the sea,"The Queen Mary ocean liner is apparently still floating, even though she is permanently moored in Long Beach. I did two different tours and saw a lot of the ship, from the Wheelhouse with all its brass controls to the Engine Room, full of huge machinery. There are many large public rooms with lots of period features in wood, etc. All very interesting and with good guides who supply lots of interesting facts. There are also places to eat onboard so half a day or more can easily pass. The ship is located slightly out-of-the way, but is well signposted.",MMcbey
50,Queen Mary nuff said,"History, scenic views, paranormal tour, food, bars, rooms to sleep in, banquet halls, just too much to list. A must see while in Long Beach.",Antonio5280
30,Worth the visit and the Russian Submarine is a must,"Worth the visit and check out the Russian Submarine while you are there. Parking is expensive and the attraction is not cheap either, but for a unique experience make sure you visit the Scorpion (B-427) she is moored next to the Queen Mary and was a Project 641 diesel-electric attack submarine of the Soviet Navy. The ""B"" in her designation stands for большая. Commissioned in 1971, the submarine operated with the Russian Pacific Fleet until decommissioning in 1994, she sailed into Long Beach under her own power.",SurfCityUSA123
40,Worthwhile break from my beloved family,"While in LA to visit family, came to Long Beach to visit the Queen Mary because I am a history buff as well as have a lifelong interest in the paranormal. I took the Metro here because I try to save my hard earned money on doing things interesting and fun instead of wasting money on expensive car rentals and parking. I was told about a free local bus called the PAssport from one of the employees at the quirky restaurant I dined in but he could not tell me where it stopped and I did not even know about it, so I decided to hoof it from the corner of Pine and Ocean. Looks closer than it is. Took me 45 minutes to get here going over the bridge and maneuvering a couple of sets of steep stairs but I was able to get a view of Mary from the other side of the bay as well as meet some Australian tourists and skateboarders! After a bit of huffing and puffing, I finally made it to her Majesty. The ticket agent did not inform me about the ghost tours or Diana's exhibit, so I just got a no frills ticket to go in and wander about this Titanic like masterpiece. The Russian submarine was closed yesterday, but growing up during the Cold War, I was NOT going to see it anyway! I ended up going on a short paranormal tour anyway and the tour guides were kind of freaky and funny. It did not scare me out of my pants, but I found it entertaining! Upon entering I went to the right side of this ship/hotel and found the history and exhibit etched on her walls and behind glass. Really enjoyed viewing and reading about the original suites. People were sure small back then! I did see the anchor and the engine room, but I did not meander long down in these dingy dark bowels because it was just metal..The second floor is mostly the hotel, but as long as you are not loud and obnoxious, you are welcome to walk around. Looked like the movie..Titanic! There is an interesting gift shop here that sells vintage toys like jacks and slinkies but I bought some candy and a few other knickknacks. The upper parts of the ship offer the visitor the most. That is where the restaurants are, a couple of other gift shops exist, the tours meet, and you can finally sit down!! Plus you can go outside on the deck and imagine what it was like to be on this ship when it really did sail. I liked looking at the small replica of the ship and learning about its different compartments. After going from top to bottom, being completely exhausted from all the walking and learning about this beautiful one of a kind masterpice, I left my Mother (Mary was my deceased mother's name)! And I sure did take the free Passport back to downtown Long Beach! I highly recommend coming here> IT is pricey but well worth it...",Marta E
30,Neat historical activity,"We did the self-guided tour while waiting to board our cruise ship--it was free. My husband and I and our teenage daughter found it interesting. Wish you could have entered more of the ""rooms"". There was an Easter brunch going on which looked very nice. Cool history and the engine room was particularily informative.",Cappygirl12
40,Interesting history,"Long beach is a beautiful place but even the most sun loving people need to take a break out of the sun. The Queen Mary is an interesting place to get some history in during your vacation. We took the haunted tour, the historical tour and the Princess Diana exhibit. The tours were interesting and the kids did well as they were not too long but almost a perfect length. The adult women really found the Princess Diana exhibit to be informative and fun. However, unless your child is particularly interested in the British Royalty. .. I would skip it and save the money. There is a lot of reading. There is a Starbucks aboard and a restaurant but we didn't visit the restaurant.",hutchens74
50,Queen Mary Boat,"Mid to late 90s, was sent out to Huntington Beach to work. I don't like the Calf people, but did enjoy this boat. We did this on a SAT or SUN. Took the tour and learned about the ghosts. I felt erie at one of the doorways, then they said a Navy man (i think) got squished in the doorway he died. Then yes, very erie around the pool deck area. Not filled with water, but they said you could see wet foot prints and giggles there. Wish we could have stayed the night and had a meal there. :( Maybe next time?",USAEnglishPrincess
30,Mixed bag,Free museum area run-down and it looks like rest of the ship may be also. Just visited the museum while waiting to board our cruiseship at an adjacent location.Self-guided tour of engine room really worthwhile. Continue on to see the beautiful propeller. Be very careful not to get lost in the bowels of the ship.,Sharron M
40,Fun afternoon touring the Queen Mary,"We bought a Groupon that included two guided tours for our family of 5. When we got to the ticket booth, admission to the Russian submarine was closed (we didn't even know that was included) so they substituted the Princess Diana exhibit instead. We went on the ""haunted"" guided tour and a historic one as well. Although the haunted one was a bit hokey, we loved it. We had a great tour guide who set the tone for some fun and made it interesting as well. Our historic tour guide was very informative and friendly. We all (we have 14, 12, and 10 year old kids) enjoyed each of the tours as well as the Princess Diana exhibit. I would recommend a visit to any of the tours of the Queen Mary.",kurin
20,Do regular tours over paranormal,"We did a paranormal night tour with my family, including four teens, and it wasn't very interesting. The tour was boring and it would have been fun to do a normal tour with history instead of ghost stories. Very attractive boat, worth seeing, but not the paranormal tours.",luvmy3kids
50,amazing trip back in time,"We stayed on the QM for only one night, but it was an amazing experience. We were able to do the haunted encounters tour and see the Princess Di collection in addition to wandering around the boat just taking in the history. The staterooms are the actual staterooms of first class passengers from the days of is glory. I will try to stay there on my next trip to Long Beach.",Gitmobound

50,Queen Mary attraction in Long Beach,Had dinner with friends at Queen Mary in Long Beach. Great views of the harbor/waterfront. The food was good and the service was excellent. Plenty of (chargeable) parking right in front of Queen Mary.,Jerald F
50,The whole family loved the Queen Mary,"I was excited to go but my kids thought it might be like homework on our trip to Anaheim but they (and the hubby) loved it after getting there. I had bought a groupon and was surprised it included the self guided audio tour, the general tour and a ghost tour. The ghost tour was really fun. The man described it as the jungle cruise meets the haunted mansion in Disneyland and it was a good comparison. It was much bigger than the Titanic and although it wasn't LA's history, the history of the ship is really interesting.",Cansnow S
10,Didn't see it,"One of the main reasons for visiting Long Beach on our tour of the West Coast was to see the Queen Mary. We got the free shuttle bus to it but found the boat had been taken over for a tattoo exhibition called Ink and Iron. We had wrongly made the assumption that this attraction was open virtually year round to the public and hadn't bothered to check the website when we would have found out.I'm not sure why they hold events like this on the ship, especially when there are so many convention halls at Long Beach. I'm sure we would not have been the only people to have turned up to be disappointed. I would have thought it would have been a key attraction for visitors from cruise ships so it's worth checking on the QM website if visiting this attraction is important to you.",KeithmT
50,Great Tour and Exhibits,"When booking online I didn't reserve the exhibits and tour times that we wanted, but when we arrived, the staff was very accommodating in changing these for us. Could have spent all day at the Diana exhibit! Our tour guide, Dan, was very entertaining and knowledgeable about the history of the ship - a lot more information than on the self-guided tour. The lunch in the Promenade Cafe was very nice. Also, don't miss the Russian submarine!",Shirleeee
40,Paul and kathy,Great ship with rich history .yes she is a little run down and bath almost Victorian but it's a unique opportunity to see a grand old lady which safely carried a million us soldiers to uk without protection using her high speed and resourceful crew.Churchill signed d day order on her and we recommend the history tour.Only complaint was when we boarded we were told our cabin faced car park as used booking com so invited to pay 50 per cent more for cabin facing the sea .I strongly suspect they tell everyone that!!churhill restaraunt very good .Cabin was comfortable albeit old style furniture and lights etc but that is part of her charm .If you want a modern hotel don't stay but do the ships tour .,Isabella C
50,A 'Must See' when you visit Long Beach,"We had another cruise stop-over at San Pedro and decided on this occasion to visit the Queen Mary at Long Beach. The attraction was made even more enjoyable by the fact that cruisers could use their stateroom cards to obtain free admission to all but the special exhibitions within. Anyone who has a passion in cruising or art deco designs will have an excellent time in wandering around the open and closed promenade decks, the radio room, the wedding chapel, the bridge and the forward and aft areas. Perhaps take in a meal, or snack or drink - check out the ship's website. The souvenirs in the shops are also awesome. Highly recommended.",Stuart L
50,"Best exhibit on the Queen Mary -"" Diana ""","Diana Exhibit not only has some of Diana, but the whole English history of the royal family. It was superbly exhibited...There is a special on Groupon right now.....it was well worth it and the Engine tour.",powersusa
20,Not Very Good Audio Tours,"I went here with my family on a long weekend, and we were kind of disappointed. We had booked an audio tour, and half of our guides broke or had some kind of problem in the first five minutes. Different rooms on the ship were hard to find and were poorly labeled on the map. Unless you are a person who's really into old ships and taking bad audio tours, I would skip visiting.",syd02030
40,"A Tour around the Queen Mary, Long Beach","There were no queues for boarding the Queen Mary when we visited in May. There was an self guided audio tour which took us a while to get to grips with but once we sorted it out it was fine. The instructions to get to the next place were sometimes a bit complicated but again we used the stop, start buttons. The ship was really interesting and we could have spent more time but we were on a tight schedule and had to miss the Ghost and Legends ""adventure"". We were told about the free "" Passport"" buses which we used to get to the Queen Mary. Well worth the price of the ticket which we bought on line.",james r
20,The Queen Mary should be give the deep 6!,"Maybe you are a history buff and would enjoy the tour but I have been on the QM on and off since it first came to Long Beach in the early 70's. Sure, there are interesting things and facts about the ship but do not stay at the hotel. The ship always seems to be in a state of change and never stable. They do / did have a great bar near the bridge of the ship but you just cannot go on board to enjoy a drink. You have to pay. This is a pricey visit and I would be satisfied to take pictures outside and pass on the rest.",Bill C
10,THE QUEEN MARY LONGBEACH CALIFORNIA BE WARNED !!!,After finishing Route 66 in Santa Monica which I recommend anybody to do it is fantastic with all pre booked hotels no problems however this all changedwhen arriving at the QUEEN MARY again pre booked we found according to the staff that the ship had been built lopsided I.e the De Luxe cabins which I booked were on the side overlooking the excessively priced car park not ideal but we could have a Standard room overlooking the water front a better option but no refund!!There are no facilities I.e tea/coffee kettle or water unless you again pay exorbitant cabin service charges.On going into our room it was in need of light bulbs and was not very clean I have been in a two star hotel better the this . The ship was grand once but now is looking worn out and gives the impression that it is being milked to death with no hint of any money being reinvested. The staff are miserable the service is poor the food is average the manager if there is one cannot be seen when I asked who owns the ship thestaff would not say strange because somebody must pay their wages? This was a VERY EXPENSIVE mistake which I regret . DO NOT UNDERESTIMATEHOW BAD IT IS AND HOW EXPENSIVE. P.S there is one trick they missed you get a hairdryer and the ice machine in the corridor IS FREE WOW!!!! so you can make your own water.,Pat p
50,Stunning! A must do.,"After coming back from a day trip to Catalina Island, my wife and I decided to check out the ""old girl"".Parking was easy, and by having the ticket validated at the restaurant, it only cost $8.The concierge staff at the entry were super helpful. We paid $15 each to get in, but the big bonus was that when we had a meal, this cost of entry went toward the meal.We self toured from bow to stern. Wow, wow, wow.After exploring the ship, and looking in the gift shops we went to the Promenade Cafe for a meal. My wife had the Quesadilla and a glass of bubbles and I had the patty melt. and soda (I was driving) and the total cost was $43.33 including taxes, of which the $30 entry fee was deducted. Very, very reasonable for a meal and sightseeing of a majestic old lady of the sea.Seriously - this is a must do when in LA. A proper guided tour is now on our list, so that we get all of the history.",Steve A

40,I love old cruise ships and took the tour,I have visited the Queen Mary many times over 30 years. I love this old ship. I am glad the a finally putting some money refreshing this fantastic ship! It is worth a visit!,NitroDog
20,Heartbreaking!,"My husband and I spent our first anniversary on the Queen Mary in May of 1982. At that time the ship was majestic, and the weekend we spent there was like a fairy tale. But after 33 years, we were horrified to discover that she has become run down and appears neglected, to say the least.At the end of May this year, we thought it would be fun to kick off a visit back home on the Queen Mary. We didn't even stay the three nights we reserved. We made it through two nights, but if it had been convenient, we would've left after one.Maybe if a visitor doesn't know what the Queen Mary was like before, they'll be ok with its condition. I'm sorry to say that my husband and I were not.",Mary C

40,Interesting Piece of Maritime History.,"Combined ticket for the Queen Mary and the Scorpian Submarine. $35 including tax for the Royal Ticket which also included two guided tours of the ship. We decided to do the Ghosts and Legends hour long tour in the morning, followed by the 1/2hour special effects Ghost Tour which was good fun and our guides hammed it up, making it good fun. Boy tours were informative and interesting.The audio guide was useful and included in the ticket price.Thee is a lot of walking up and down stairs around the ship, which should be considered when looking at visiting this venue.There are shops selling an assortment of branded souvineers. Bar, restaurant and even a Starbucks.Thoroughly enjoyable afternoon out.",RJC6464
50,Wonderful experience,The Queen Mary is an experience unto itself and dinner on the Queen Mary is not to be missed if at all possible. The view from the dining room across the harbor is really lovely. The food and service are excellent.,david a
40,Worth a visit!,"There are lots of different tours on the Queen Mary, but you can take a self-guided tour and see many interesting things. We just walked around and found miniature replicas of the ship, and other famous ships, found our way into the engine room, and saw beautiful salons. The Queen Mary could use some maintenance, but the fact that things are old and worn adds to the charm. It is used today for lots of events, proms, weddings, etc., and we got to peak into some of the rooms while they were setting up, and it was fun to see how beautiful and charming the salons are. You could spend as must as several hours, or you can see some highlights in an hour.",Roberta R
50,Need more time than you realise,Had a fantastic day on The Queen Mary but still didn't see it all. Took the historical tour which was very interesting and just loved the Art Deco bar and cocktails. Money well spent,CherylMcCrae

I wish they had more options for the haunted tour, my son would have loved that, but the limited times didn't work with our schedule. Still the basic tour was fun and rich with history. I think it would be a fun place to stay on our next visit to California!",Kelly Y
50,California road trip,"Brilliant! I saw the Queen Mary in 1968 not long after she arrived in Long Beach as a young seaman and I never thought I would get the opportunity to stay on her. It was a good value experience much cheaper than expected. All the staff were so helpful arranged a small bus tour of Hollywood and Beverley hills for us. Altogether a great experience to walk the decks where so many famous people had walked and to sample the luxuries. When we stayed on board the Los Angeles Art Deco society were holding their annual ball Wow! it was like stepping back in time everyone in period costume and the quayside lined with classic cars. If you're going to LA this is a must do! Try and check in advance when the Art Deco society will be there, just the icing on the cake!",Trevor V

We had a great time, ate well, and spent a fulfilling day at the Queen Mary.",John S
50,Awesome boat full of history,"We took a 2 hour paranormal tour on the Queen Mary after dinner one night and it was terrific. The history of the ship is discussed in detail plus you are taking into areas not open to the general public. Well worth the money and time! (And no, we didn't see anything paranormal on our tour.)",Lisa H
40,A unique experience sleeping on the Queen Mary.,I loved the authentic sleeping quarters and the Princess Diana exhibit. I was so excited to sleep aboard the Queen Mary (a floating hotel). My husband and I were in a Suite and enjoyed it's spaciousness and history. The tours and Princess Diana exhibit were great!,Heather M
30,Mixed feelings on customer service,"Two of us got tickets for the Diana exhibition while two of us got tickets for the tour. The tour started at 5pm, so we all walked around until it was time. However, it turned out the Diana exhibition closed at 5pm. No information about this when we bought the tickets an hour earlier, no information on the posters or doors. When we complained about this at customer service onborad, we were offered a paper form to fill out, and that was it. As we were leaving the country the next day, we were not able to come back. In the end we had to ask to be allowed to do the tour instead. I was surprised we had to ask!The tour was good. The guide had lots of information, and made a show out of it. Not a bad word about the tour at all.As we left the ship, we went back to the ticketing to let them know once again that we were disappointed not to be able to see the exhibition we wanted to. The lady were sweet and understanding, she made a note of what we said and she even offered to refund our tickets even if this was not what we asked for nor expected. I am sure if she had been on customer service onboard she would have offered us the tour as we missed out of the exhibition, and that would have been it for us.We see now that the times for the exhibition is available on the website - thank you for updating your information! And thank you to the lady who made an effort to make a very disappointing visit better.",PixieTinkie
40,"Interesting, long visit","This is an interesting attraction. Note that entry options are somewhat confusing, with the guided tours versus self-tour. Did not do a guided tour but can't imagine we missed much. Took us over 2.5 hours to walk entirety of ship (with self audio tour). Certainly interesting.",wwstraveler
40,Depends what your looking for,"The Queen Mary is known for being a historical attraction. If your looking for history, it has it. But the overpriced parking and food are a downside. I have seen the Princess Diana Exhibit which I found interesting and been to the Halloween attraction which is also fun but overcrowded. It is nice to spend an afternoon there but find parking on the street and eat in downtown Long Beach afterwards, it will be more pleasant.",silyay
40,new experience,"It was a great place ro visit for one time. It was big ship really. Alot of things to see of that ship history. you ll find on board some resturants, shops and a hotel. Dont miss the horror journey inside the ship it was a great walking trip inside the ship.",Ahmad T
30,"Nice, but disorganized. Nice, but old.","Yes, you can see that I was not 100% satisfied with this vist. We stayed on the boat for an avernight stay. The roome was a 2 room suite, very chic, but very old. Woul need some refresh. We alsovisited the Princess Diana exhibition on the boat, but found it more like a private collection than an actual exhibition deserving this title. Finally, we mede the tour of the boat with audioguide. This tour could have been extremely interesting, but ended up being just OK because it made us walked from an extremity of the boat to the other, and then come back to square one at the end...could use a reshuffling to make it more pleasant.",Montreal_explorators
20,Very disappointed,"I had visited this attraction some 20 years ago already once and was quite amazed then. This time I was very disappointed.first and foremost, they do have a self guided tour. that's a plus. however, one whole deck was not available to visit, and the self guided tour kept on guiding us to the closed area and we were unable to find the entry... only later we leaned that one whole deck was closed.2nd, the bridge was closed due to the rain.3rd, we had to visit the engine room first, as that was to be closed at 3 pm (for whatever reason...) and reopen again at 5 pm.so the guided tour could not be used in the right sequence, making it a bit difficult to find the correct narrative.4th, the full price of 29$ for the tour, with some areas closed, is beyond what is offered. many other areas on the promenade deck were also not visible (windows covered) as they were also being remodeled.on top of the 29$ entry per person, we had to pay 18$ for parking. a total rip off - sorry. very disappointed",59Impala
50,Long Live the Queen,"They have done a remarkable job of preserving this historic ship close to how it appeared in its sailing days while making it comfortable for today's use. Our stateroom had modern heating and cooling which you adjusted using the original air vents. The bathroom retained the original cast iron tub.Room rates are high on the weekend. If you can stay midweek it will cost about half as much. Also, look for HUGE discounts if you are a government employee. This is a once-in-a-lifetime historical experience. Book the best room you can afford.",Mike H
40,How things once were,"This is like stepping back in time. The ship was retired from active service back in 1967, so coming up 50 years since it was last on the ocean. The cafe is good, I was very pleased with both the food and the service. outer decks offer good views back to Longbeach. Great seeing some of the opulent detail of the rooms and common areas. The audio tour definitely worthwhile and I definitely recommend the submarine as uour half price add on tour",Albywon
40,All Hail the Queen,Like stepping back in time to another era this was a great experience. Bring your walking shoes and a jacket as some areas are chilly inside the ship. The audio tour was helpful and we also added the Princess Diana tour. Lunch in their cafe was very good.,EdIsaacs
40,Piece of Nautical history and apparently haunted,They have special events and a wonderful Sunday brunch in a beautifully appointed room...you can walk around and see some of the artifacts and collections of memorabiliaYou can also catch an amazing view of the Long Beach shoreline and shops...beautiful during the day and amazing at night!!!,Charlaine M
30,"Do it once, not twice","I used a coupon for half price tickets, would not have paid full price for this. Included was either the submarine tour or the ghost tour. We chose the ghost tour which was not convincing. Special effects were so-so. Only good thing was that you get to see the pool which otherwise is not accessible. We did not get to see the rooms. The boat is slowly decaying. We could not see the whole exhibit at the end since they were working on some things and half of it was closed. Parking was EXPENSIVE ($18) and there is no other place to park.",mielvert
30,a little dated,"we visited and walked all over the ship, the paint is peeling badly, and the decks are rotting, attempts are being made to repair parts of the ship but the rust seems to be winning, the entrance fee allows you entry but then there is another fee for the tour ora fee for the headsets to walk alone, it was a pretty quiet place and visitors were sparse, we did venture into the hotel corridors and did get to see a cabin which was still in the period but with a few modern facilities, it seemed gloomy and nothing much was happening there, i wouldn't bother staying in the hotel and once seen the ship is done, interesting but nothing to get over excited about",steptoe88
20,Queen Mary Tour,"A very poor value for a lot of your money. $18 to park,$25p/p admission ,$5p/p for audio tour.Started with lunch onboard at promenade deck cafe.mediocre food at fine food prices.Butmuch more then that the smell of smoke and fried food was overpowering. Altogether a distinctlyUnpleasant dining experience. Now for the audio tour ,4 adults usually pretty good at readingmaps,this was impossible to find your way. They had us running from deck to deck instead ofFinishing one. Exactly 1/2way through 2 of our headsets stopped working ,we went to exchangethem ,as would seem only right and were told that they had no more,so I asked for a refund forThose 2 and this is a quote . This happens all the time so we don't give refunds,it must be a ghost.As for the rest of the ship -flaking paint and general poor upkeep. I always wanted to see the QueenBut you would be better off to just look. Expensive day and a feeling you got cheated.",461gary
30,Big Ship (and some history),"Used a Living Social offer and got half-off of two tickets. Probably worth that amount, We chose the guided historical tour verses the haunted tour. It was included with the passport ticket we got for the tour. You probably can save the money and do the self-guided tour. Plan to spend a couple of hours wandering the decks. It was a beautiful day in Long Beach so we spent a lot of time on the upper deck in the ocean breeze.",Darren H
30,Meh,"Didn't get a chance to go inside, and none of the folks at the door acted as if they wanted to let me in to look around. So mostly what I noticed was the paint peeling on the outside of the ship. Makes me wonder what the inside looks like.",Jennifer B

50,Excellent!!,We spent a lovely 4 hours exploring the Queen Mary and having lunch there. The history is so very interesting and the views from the decks. Loved the time there!,797judithw
50,Superb view and thrilling ghost stories,It was nice to know the history of Queen Mary and it's even more thrilling to learn about its facts and sone ghost stories. the ghost stories attraction is fun as it made it even more realistic with the chilly sounds and visual effects.,Roxy B
40,Queen mary,"We knew the ship was here, saw it on our trip last sept. When we went to DisneyLand. It was very good and informative. Did the self guided tour on some venues as well as the guided tour with an older well informed enthusiastic gentlemen.A very good venue for younger and mature people. Enjoyed it.",Tweetyferg
50,Back in Time!,We had a great time here. We did the ghost tour--well done! The women did the Diana tour which is more than just Diana. Lots of actual dresses. The food was good and only slightly expensive. The rooms/ cabins are big but not much in them.,mageith
50,"Queen Mary ship, Long Beach California","Tour attractions, took the historic passport which included Ghost and haunted legend show & Glory days tour inclusive of Scorpio - the submarine visit. The tour guide especially for the Glory days was excellent. Very informative. The ship is still in very good condition and well maintained and the history is another story! It was a lovely trip steeped in history and glory. The restaurant Promonade, on the ship had a good menu! The Ghost and haunted tour was ok, graphics good but I felt it was a bit of a let down but still enjoyable.",Lakshmi M
30,Sad to see this once great liner starting to rot away,"It must be so expensive to try and maintain this ageing liner as she slowly starts to rot and rust away. A lot of the fixtures have been stripped away and replaced with fittings and furniture for conferences and weddings as the owners grapple with trying squee every last dollar from her. Her dignity has gone, but underneath there are still some remnants of her past glory. Sad in a way to see but for a while longer she sits there serene and steady until it is time to say goodbye or bon voyage forever",CheshireDave33
40,"""History everywhere you wander""","We went specifically for the Princess Diana exhibit and found it to be very well done, although it was really more of a ""Royal Family"" exhibit. It was not too crowded and we could spend as much time as we wished wandering around the rooms, reading or watching the mini videos. We also toured the ship and found it to be interesting as well. We did not do any of the guided tours although we encountered several and the guides appeared to be lively and animated. If you enjoy history, this is a nice way to spend an afternoon.",lhpbsf
40,A little bit of history,"We bought tickets that included two different tours, which gave a good overall view of what life was like when the Queen Mary was the last word in luxury travel. It is now operated as a museum and a hotel but unfortunately we were unable to see any of the guest rooms as the hotel was fully booked, which was a bit disappointing. Between the morning and afternoon tours we had time to get lunch in one of the dining rooms, which was surprisingly good value for money. This attraction is probably best suited to the older traveller who remembers when the Queen Mary was actually still sailing between the UK and New York.",CCB53
40,A grand old ship,"I visited this property, because I'm highly educated in history, and have always loved things like ships, trains, airplanes, tanks, etc. It is a hotel, but I was just there for the day. Tickets are not cheap, but you can spend all day exploring. I saw the bridge, officers quarters, radio room, engine room, salons, etc. And there are decent places to eat on board. If you stay at the hotel, there are special programs, like the ""haunted tour"" that you can partake. It was a special experience, but you have to be history and seafaring buff to make the most of it.",Lance K
40,Definitely neat!,Definitely recommend the tours and even the Princess Diana thing was cool. The tour guide was well knowledgeable and the history is just amazing when you go and see some of the actually rooms of the crew.There's also a Russian Submarine docked next to the Queen Mary worth a look too.,E_moRtal_1
50,Very interesting and Historic,There are several kinds of tours available and you can explore some on your own. Fun place to spend a few hours.,Bob980
50,Great Experience,"This place was great to see (we did not stay there)!!! The two things I loved the best were (1) You could tour the place on your own & there was NO ONE pushing you in any direction or to buy any souvenirs & (2) the engine rooms were awesome to see. I am sure it is all what you are into, but it was very cool to see. They even still have one of the propeller's underwater that you can see right along with all the shafts, controls, everything. Very neat!!!!!!!",Elizabeth
30,Awesome Piece of History,"We enjoyed this tour. We did the self audio tour and found it very factual but not very organized. There needed to be a brochure that said ""Start Here."" and there needed to be better signage, ""This way to location 6."" In fact, the associates that give you the head set will tell you not to go in numerical order but start on the top deck and work down. All I can say, it was an event to find the Engine Room! All in all, if you are resourceful this is a must do tour but pricey...",13phillytraveller
50,Awesome and eerie,"I'm a history buff and my friends knew it, so one night during my visit they suggested we visit The Queen Mary. We didn't go on any fancy tour, or even eat there - we just went to soak in the history and I thought it was awesome. Being able to see into some of the restored cabins was really great and gave a good ""feel"" for what it would have been like to travel on this ship. It was eerie, though. More than once I looked over my shoulder thinking someone was coming up behind me and there was no one there. Nice contribution to my pack of ""things that go bump in the night"" stories.",Sheila C
10,Unethical practices,"We recently had an educator's conference at the Queen Mary. I don't suggest staying as the rooms are simply not that good...but if you do stay, be sure to check your bill as they will charge you for erroneous items in hopes that you will pay. In my case, it was bottled water that I did not use. I learned of the charge after I returned home. After a few inquiries to my colleagues, it was found that they did the same to others in our reservation block. When confronted the hotel about this ""ghost"" charge, they denied any wrong doing and would not remove the charge. Never, never, again.",Charles B
50,Very interesting tour and nice meal,"We had eaten on the Queen Mary before but never taken the tour. The tour was fascinating. Lots of ghost stories and given how dark some of the hallways were it was pretty creepy. The rooms were interesting, very well preserved. It was kind of like walking back in time. My understanding is that you can actually stay on the ship although we didn't do that. I can't remember if we had to pay for the tour (I should have done this review sooner. :()There is a very nice fairly pricey restaurant on board (we didn't eat there this time but as I recall, the food and service were very good).",Mary Ellen W
10,SPARE YOURSELF! DON'T GO!!!,"July 4th 2014 my mother was visiting so we decided to go to the Queen Mary for the festivities and fireworks. We paid extra for the ""VIP"" pass. It was a total waste of money, a huge disappointment and the worst 4th of July I've ever had. The VIP pass supposedly gave better access to see the fireworks. Unfortunately families of employees were allowed to stand on a special bridge which almost totally blocked our view. There was almost no seating available in the VIP section and security was extremely rude and absolutely refused to help. One security guard told us they were way understaffed for the amount of people but the ship administrators were too cheap to staff appropriately. There were no food vendors in the VIP section so you had to leave that section to buy very expensive food and go up or down stairs each way. One of the restaurants ran out of food so had to close early. There was no organization upon entering the ship. We wandered around for an hour trying to find the entrance. There were only 2 elevators and we waited for over 1/2 an hour without being able to use it. My mother has difficulty using the stairs and I was 1 month post op from major abdominal surgury. There was no staff around to provide any assistance.When we went to leave, it was mass chaos again. We had taken a bus from a satellite parking garage. The bus line was totally unorganized and unmarked. People didn't know which line to get into. The line was at least two blocks long and 6-8 people thick but other people were allowed to cut the line and get on the bus before people who had been waiting for a long time. Again the security was very rude and had no clue how to handle the crowd except by using force and foul language. Terrible no good very bad July 4th. DON'T GO!! Sit on the banks with a blanket and picnic basket for free and you will have much better time.",stephcastle
40,Visited during cruise ship stop,"Long Beach was one of our ports of call during our 7 day Princess cruise along the California Coast. Admission was free (or included) because we were from the cruise ship that docked here for the day. We showed our cruise card and we walked in. If we wanted to do a tour with a tour guide then that would have been extra money. Honestly, I don’t see a need to pay for a tour guide. Highly recommend seeing the Queen Mary, especially since the admission was included with our cruise.",2thdoc73
40,Wondefull place,A journey in history in a very pleasant park. Lot of places to park your car and a great experience .,Mario G
50,The Old Queen!!,"A must-see attraction in Long Beach and one we were lucky to stay on! Stayed on board for 4 nights and loved every moment. Not pristine by any standard but then its over 80 years old! Period charm in spades and a courteous staff and helpful management. Lots of features and most in working condition, sadly no pool which I was disappointed to find was not available but the new gym was a welcome find and well equipped cool and quiet! Food was excellent and the waiting staff polite and welcoming. Superb value for money as it is priced as a 3* hotel not the 5* it once was in its heyday as a floating palace.Probably a three night stay is what you'd need but we were very happy with our period bathroom and features in the stateroom...we also found out we were in the epicenter of the most haunted part of the ship so that made it kind of cool too! We didn't see anything but the fire alarm at 5am one morning was a bit suspicious!! If you get the chance you must stay on board--you will not regret it! The views from the ship are stunning and breakfast with a view of Long Beach is one to stay in the mind for a lifetime. The Bar at the front of the ship is cool and totally Art Deco glamorous and you can imagine how the first class passengers must have loved it.",neilmorris75
30,Promenade Cafe on the Queen Mary,"I was part of a party of six, each of us trying a different dish - fish tacos (good, but spicy), BBQ Chicken salad (way too much chipotle, had to return it), Reuben sandwich (good, but fries were soggy), Cobb Salad (okay, but not great), Club Sandwich (not even toasted, so-so), but...the HAMBURGER! Here is your best bet for the bucks. None of the entrees were cheap so go with the Hamburger! Be sure you validate your parking (saves $10).The 4th floor was fun to experience. And, after all, you are on the Queen Mary!",jandas2

50,Take the Haunted Encounters Tour,"We visited the Queen Mary in late March, when the weather was beautiful and after Spring Break crowds.We arrived in the late afternoon and only had time for one tour, so we chose the Haunted Encounters tour. It's advertised as an hour long but this tour started a little late and ended about 10 minutes early, perhaps it was a long day for the guide? In any event the tour was well attended and very informative. The guide was funny yet had fascinating stories to tell. If you have time take the self audio tour and learn lots of fascinating facts about the ship.",Wanda F

10,Glory Days Tour - The Guide never showed up,"We booked our tour online and were really looking forward to it as we were unable to do the tour the year before due to time constraints.The day of the tour, we showed up 5 minutes early at the designated meeting spot. After waiting for 10 minutes, we asked the girl at the ticketing counter if perhaps we had made a mistake and were meeting at the wrong place. She asked us what tour we were waiting for. We told her and she informed us the tour was not taking place. We assured her that we had bought tickets in advance and showed her our booking slip. She told us it wasn't happening that day. Bear in mind, we had been standing by her desk for 10 minutes already and she had said nothing to us. She didn't bother to ask what we were doing there. And she had no explanation as to why the tour that we had booked, was not taking place. We asked for a refund and wanted to put in a complaint and she said she would forward our complaint, but that she couldn't issue a refund.A few days after our return home, I received an email 'Refund Application Status' from the tour company. They stated:""Unfortunately we are unable to offer you a refund. As stated at the time of purchase and printed on all of our tickets, it is our policy that all ticket sales are nontransferable and nonrefundable."" They then offered us two 'passport tickets' which are valid for 2 years. Firstly, from what I can see, they don't cover the tour we paid for and secondly, what if we have no plans to return? So I called the number they gave. I called again and again and again and no one ever answered in accounts. I tried 5 times. I eventually gave up. I think it is disgusting that the tour guide never showed and no explanation or apology was offered. And then to be told that the tickets are non-refundable? Unforgivable.",RachaelAdams
50,A Look Back in Time,"The Queen Mary is an incredible ship with a history as grand as the lady herself. My first father-in-law Ole Brundt was a voyager on the Queen Mary. He sailed from his home land of Denmark over to America to live out his dreams.In addition, the ship is reported to be haunted so it has an added attraction for those who believe in ghosts!",ErikaLynSmith
40,A neat stop,I wish we would have stayed a night in the converted hotel! We just didn't feel comfortable making that call without seeing it first.

They were very friendly and helpful.,Polar_Opposites

50,"Yes, it's bigger than Titanic","For anyone even casually interested in maritime history and the great ocean liners of the early 20th century, the Queen Mary is a dream! It's the only one of the liners to have survived to the present day and is well worth an extended visit.One boards via the promenade deck, an expansive walkway running the length of the ship, and is immediately thrown back in time. If you've elected to do the audio tour, you'll be taken around in a somewhat illogical and circuitous path, but the information does enhance the experience, so I'd say it's still recommended (and it's included in the price of admission). You would also have a great experience simply boarding and wandering around, but wouldn't get as much of the history.I signed up for the Haunted tour of the ship, which is apparently usually a rather kitschy affair involving special effects. The effects were down for maintenance the day of my visit, so our knowledgeable and wry guide improvised in a most amusing fashion. Still, the effect had me looking cautiously over my should once we were set free to explore on our own once again, especially in the cavernous and largely abandoned engine rooms.This place is pristine, and clearly well-kept by passionate people. Yes, you will walk quite a lot, and my iPhone told me I climbed the equivalent of 30 flights of stairs. It's absolutely worth the effort.As a hotel, I might have my reservations about making a reservation. As an historic site, the rooms I saw were not very modern, and the furnishings were, in general, a bit tired. Still, I might stay a night some day for the novelty, and perhaps to catch a whiff of Winston Churchill's ghostly cigar...",Evan F
40,Nice attraction,"I've visited the Queen Mary on several occasions throughout the years. Their Halloween party was a lot of fun, we stayed overnight at the hotel, & most recently attended their NYE party. It's definitely a place to checkout if you're in the area - a lot of the original settings of the ship is still in place. I plan to go back someday for one of their paranormal tours :)",Abbey130
30,Be prepared to walk,"Fun day trip. Interesting to see the ship. Would have like to have seen more of it though. It seems like most of it now is hotel rooms and updated restaurants.

It was worth the price just to look at the creepy pool.",naturelover718

40,A Sight To See!,"It was enjoyable and the kids had fun. It was great to see the stories and artifacts from the era. Dislike how expensive the parking was ($15) for two to three hours on board. Also I don't recommend a ""self-guided"" tour. I am sure we missed something.We paid extra to see the Russian Submarine, and my son (7) LOVED this! It was worth it for sure.",dmmw11

10,Over Priced,Would not recommend this unless you have $100 to throw away. No signage to tell you which way to go on the tour. Everything is worn out and in need of repairs. Such a shame a grand ship with all the stories it can tell and no one to speak for her,John L
50,Loved this ship!,"My husband had to pry me out of this ship with a crow bar. The ship itself is a little older, and that's what makes it so beautiful. We were lucky enough to have a cabin with some original woods and fixtures. This thing is huge, one day is not enough. You will need to be mindful of noise, as there's no soundproofing. The novelty of eating on the ship was a definite for me, though eating on it every day you stay (seriously, you're going to need a huge memory card and at least 2 days to explore) can be a little much. The propeller room is eerie and impressive.",brendyb75

The guide was very knowledgeable about the ship and life at sea. It was quite impressive to see all of the art deco touches - from the decor to the fixtures and reliefs.

50,Remarkable Dinner and Visit!,"Eating dinner on the Queen Mary for a special occasion with a special friend was quite remarkable! The atmosphere was unique. I have to admit I felt a little like we were walking on the deck of the movie set for the ""Titanic"" as we made our way to the restaurant.Eating in the restaurant was delicious, fantastic, friendly, romantic. The waiters were wonderful. The menu was amazing. Yes, it was pricey, but that made it extra special. And afterwards we walked around the ship in the dark, looking at every nook and cranny.",Ted A
40,A fine afternoon afloat.,"The four of us went especially to see the Bob Hope display. We did two of the ship's tours also. We even walked throught the Princess Diana tribute. The tours were interesting. They had some memorabilia from when TQM was a WWII troup carrier. Both of the tour guides were friendly and informative.We had lucked out and gotten coupons on Groupon for the admission and tours. But would have enjoyed it even if we hadn't.One of the more interesting things, was while on the tour that was themed after the 'haunted ship' my camera changed settings. It changed to a setting that I didn't know/remember that it had. The setting made it so that the photos had a dark 'frame' around each photo.Aside from that, we had a good time.",RAMspeed
40,You gotta stay here at least once,"I booked a couple of nights on the Queen Mary around Christmas time for a mini family getaway. It was me, my husband and our four children ranging in age from 8 to 14.First of all, it was hard to get rooms with that number of kids because most of the affordable rooms only have two twin beds. Our first night we had three double rooms - one was on a different floor and was a handicap accommodating room and was the only room we could get that did not have twin beds. The other two rooms were in the center of the ship, each with two twin beds. These two rooms were extremely rustic. My kids were afraid of the toilets and the ancient fixtures and cabinets. I found it totally charming.My only complaint (which I did bring to their attention) was the temperature in the rooms. We were roasting. I asked for help with it and after the second visit by the engineer, they were still unable to fix the problem. They were very generous and upgraded our rooms and moved us. The newer rooms were not quite as rustic, but we had portholes that looked out front of the ship and that was awesome.There are a lot of attractions to enjoy while you are there. I took someone's advice and did the audio tour first. It was excellent and took you all over the ship and even down into the engine room. It was really worth it - and came free with the room reservations.We also got discount tickets from the room reservation. My husband took the younger kids to the Russian Submarine and they really enjoyed it. I took my older kids to the Princess Diana exhibit, which was fun but glad we only had to pay half price. We did not get a discount for Chill, so we did not go to that despite the pleading from the children. It was fun to look out over it anyway.The food on the ship was good - not amazing - and was twice what you would pay elsewhere. We struggled to provide breakfast since we didn't want to blow all our money in their restaurants. We took the short drive over to the mainland to eat - which was worth it. There are no mini fridges in the rooms, by the way. With your room key you can come and go from the pay parking lot without having to pay each time.I have already recommended The Queen Mary to others. It is the type of place you should go at least once. It is living history at it's finest. And I would suggest staying on board for the full experience.",Tasiadoo

40,Worth the visit,"It was wonderful to be able to see a piece of history. The ship, for a ship fro the late 1930's, was beautiful. We took the basic historical tour and then wandered around the ship for another hour. Be sure to go down to the engine room and up to the bridge. Both are things that you rarely get to see on a ship. We were very impressed after wandering through the engine room with the size of the equipment and the actual magnitude of that area.",Barb D
50,Fascinating,"We visited the ship during the Scots festival on President's Day weekend. Although the tours were limited due to the festival, we were still able to walk through the ship and explore on our own.

40,Beautiful Piece of History!,"What a beautiful piece of History! I am so glad that they have preserved it and done so much to keep the memories alive! We had just disembarked the Carnival Imagination and decided to wander over to visit the old Queen Mary. It's been close to 25 years since I had last visited and having been just about 10 years old at the time, I don't remember much about it, so I was in for a real treat!History came alive, from the moment we stepped aboard the massive giant. With beautiful models of the Queen Mary, Titanic and other nautical marvels, the story of the cruise liners of the day really came alive. We wandered through the ship, marveled with the kids about the Children's Playroom, and read about the history of this cruise liner turned battleship. I do wish that there was more to read about the history of the ship, as you wander through.But the creme de la creme of the experience, for me at least, was the Princess Diana exhibit! I was able to take my sweet little girl and allow her to experience the wonder and majesty of such a beautiful woman, whom I had grown to idolize from early childhood. She was a true Princess. I was able to show my little girl all the amazing charities she helped, the beautiful dresses that she wore and how much she was adored, both in England and abroad. We spent hours wandering, reading, ogling and awing over all that Princess Diana was. Such a priceless experience with my own little princess. We even picked up a darling little paper doll book with Princess Di dresses for her to play with on the long drive home.We ended a wonderful time at the Queen Mary with a visit to the Promenade Cafe where we enjoyed one of the most wonderful burgers I have ever tasted and hands down, the best clam chowder I have ever had!I highly suggest this attraction to anyone who finds themselves in the Long Beach area. There is a charge for parking, but you can get it validated at the restaurant and it's only about $7 for three hours. There is an admission charge to the Queen Mary, but by showing your sail & sign card, you will receive FREE admission while your Carnival Ship is in port. The food is expensive, but well, well worth its weight in gold! There are a variety of tours and I suggest that, if you have the time, you pay a little extra for one, or more, of these fun tours. This was great for everyone in our group, from my senior in-laws to my youngest daughter, at eleven years old.",Stephanie S
50,Fantastic surprise,"A few years back I missed a connecting flight in LA and had an extra day to fill. Having heard about the Queen Mary I headed to Long Beach to see what it was like. The first sight of this ship is breathtaking with its grandeur and class. But when you walk into the entry foyer you are instantly transported back to another time. The ship oozes character and class and you easily imagine yourself amongst the excitement of passengers of the day boarding. The rest of the day was spent exploring the displays and tours, as well as enjoying a fabulous lunch. I found myself wishing the ship would simply sail away from the port! I've since been back twice and regard this attractions as one of the most favourite surprises I've stumbled upon in years of travel. Highly recommend a visit for nostalgia buffs.",Tom P
50,History at its BEST !!,"The history about this grand ship is truly amazing. Just take a walk on the deck and look out. See and read all what she has to offer her guests. If you can.... Spend the night. Even thought I no longer live in Long Beach, I still take time to visit this grand ship.",Joseph T
50,Take a tour and plan on 3-4 hours,We had a day and a half in the LA area before leaving on a cruiseand we really wanted to see the Queen Mary as I have always been fascinated by ocean liners. Since we got to the ship near the end of the day we were only able to take the Glory Days tour at 4:15. The tour guide was very friendly and informative. I wish we had had more time to see all the exhibits as we could have easily spent another 2-3 hours on the ship taking the self-guided tour.,Specman728
30,Queen Mary loads of character but she's an old girl!,"Loved the character of the ship and the history that goes with it. Room was clean and the bed and linens were comfy. I was disappointed in the bathroom as it really could have used a facelift from the original fittings. There is no noise barrier with your next door neighbour and we we could hear every word said. The outdoor park is a festival park and while loads of fun, it is impossible to settle down and sleep at night when the music is playing. A beautiful setting nonetheless.",EveMcGuire
30,Plenty of history but lots more work to be done,After reading the all the details on the website we decided to stay for two nights on the Queen Mary before flying home. She really was a grand old ship - you can almost feel what it would have been like on the first voyages. We did a tour and learnt a lot but then we went and got headphones and wandered around by ourselves. The room for the propeller is a great idea - go and see. Lots of info on both luxury cruises and the war effort. Our room was originally a vey small inside room with single beds (rather claustrophobic) but after speaking to reception we upgraded to a double bed room with a porthole - much better. The rooms have all the original fittings even in the bathrooms. Bed was comfortable and linen was good. We wandered up to have drinks in the Art Deco bar at night before dinner. She is an old ship and seems to have a lot of work going on but there is still heaps more to do to get her back into a good condition. Nice to walk around on the decks at night and enjoy the views. Not so nice when some fool breaks the fire sprinkler at 1.00 in the morning and sets the alarm off. Lucky for us it wasn't a real fire as we couldn't get out on the deck as the fire doors closed and we were stuck! Staff were busy trying to stop the water flow down the hall and not worried about us. Eventually just went back to our room but the alarm kept going off for a few more hours. Not a good nights sleep that night! We were given a discount the next morning when leaving due to the problem so that was nice. But wouldn't recommend staying on board - just go for the day and have meals there. All tours are extra even when staying on board and the parking is extra as well. Spend a day and enjoy wandering through history.,Lyndy J
30,Not a great place for those with physical limitations.,"While I had fun with the portions of the ship I was able to see, it was very difficult with my knee and back problems to get around after a while. There are no elevators in the attraction portion of the ship, so you have to brave it on foot. There were ramps in some parts, but that really only helps those in wheelchairs, and only for certain portions where the museum exhibits are. We had a lot more fun visiting the ""Chill"" ice sculpture and slide event. That was fun, but only for a short period as you can't be in there too long. The staff provides you with a parka regardless of how you are dressed and that's only available during winter.",Juan S
40,Interesting floating history.,"I've never been on a cruise, only sailboats. I don't know a lot about history, but a friend came to visit when I lived in Long Beach and wanted to see the Queen Mary. It was great! To see the ballrooms and cabins as they were in this early 1900s cruise ship was amazing. Also, the engines that drove her - truly amazing. Well worth the fee and a pleasant, interesting afternoon. Would do it again.",jeremiah54
40,Valentine's Day Event,We went to the Scots Festival but the main part of the ship was closed due to the event. Have to return at another time and will be paying to see the ship when it is open fully. Don't go during an event. Check their event calender before going. Want to stay on ship sometime and will let know.,waller1234
40,A great place to spend the day,"The Queen Mary is a beautiful, historic ship. The exhibits throughout the ship a well done. There are several places to eat and shop.",cheryl6800
30,One Time is Enough,Good for a one time experience. Very pricey tickets and parking.Very expensive drinks and food.You are paying for the view and to see the ship...which can use some maintenance and improvement in the audio tour. The hand piece for 3 out of the 4 of us failed 1/2 way through.,sealodgeg9
40,The Queen Mary,"i love the queen Mary because it is history and you go away thinking about how traveling on it during it's era was a big deal.! It still feels luxurious! However to go to dine their is off putting because without a lot of people, it feels like a deserted ship!",Joan E
30,Something to do.,Queen Mary is nice if you have not ever been on a ship. It is old not very clean. You can walk all over it for a price. Pretty to look at. Great view from the deck.,Emmaling
40,A look into a past era!,"The Queen Mary enjoyed a wonderful, rich life as a true luxury liner, prior to ending her last voyage in Long Beach.The ship has been restored to her past beauty and allow 'passengers' to truly see the richness of her past.Take time to enjoy a most enjoyable repast at Sir Winston's. This fine dining restaurant is no only beautiful it offers a menu of wonderful selections for your enjoyment.",JHodgecal
50,Dinner/Show,Attended the dinner show here for my grandparents anniversary. The entire family (children too) were engaged and had a great time!,Deanna W
50,Spend a Day at the Queen Mary,"If you love history, you need to tour the Queen Mary ship, located in Long Beach Harbor. You will step back into an elegant part of our history where cruise ships offer first class amenities like rose-colored mirrors so that even if you were sea sick, you looked great. The Art Deco decorations through the ship harken back to a nostalgic time.",vikinggal
40,Very interesting tour of Queen Mary in lovely location,"We opted for the combo ticket with the Aquarium of the Pacific and then used the free headphones to tour the Queen Mary.Very nice audio tour although you need to pay attention to the instructions, since most require you to walk quite a distance, and go up and down many stairs (not for disabled or in poor health).The place for the headphones is way on the stern (back) of the ship, up stairs then down stairs, and unfortunately you have to return to the same location to return the headphones. By then I had had enough stairs, so my husband returned both our sets and toured the last stops which was the engine room, which was down many more stairs...he said ""good choice not to go there""...But other than that it was a very nice self guided tour.The open at 10, and every two hours they blow their very loud horns, so be prepared tor that.There is a hotel, and quite a number of restaurants in the ship, and in general it is well cared for.Would recommend this on a trip to the Los Angeles area.",ODtravelers
40,Cool sight.,"It's awesome if you're into historical (and haunted) stuff! I'm not a big fan of ghosts, but my family sure did have a good time!!",Madyson P
20,Disappointing,As a Glaswegian I looked forward to seeing one of the great ships that were built on the Clyde. Looks like this won't last much longer before it rusts away. Do they do any maintenance at all?We were informed that there was a 20 minute wait for the restaurant. Turned out to be over one hour 30 minutes so we wasted time and missed the Princess Diana exhibit. Restaurant was freezing and food mediocre. Toilets were definitely not up to standard. To cap it all they were selling US navy hats. This is a British ship. Nuff said,UnaH6
40,Hauntingly Nice on the Queen,"Was down at the beach and wanted to stay in the LAX area to catch an early flight and found the Queen Mary. We were a little concerned about the size the rooms may be and just basic services but as it turned out we stayed a 2nd night. Rooms are elegant, we were on A level with a King and adjoining room with a twin. Restaurants and bars were great food and service. The bonus is the charm of the boat and her history. We even decided to go on a paranormal investigation until 2am and did have a few unexplained noises and shadows. The walls are a little thin but otherwise a really great experience.",Mark Z
40,A 'Royal' experience,"We enjoyed our visit to the ‘Diana - Legacy of a Princess’ on board the Queen Mary at Long Beach.I thought I knew a great deal about British Royalty, but the exhibition included items which I had never seen before. It included memorabilia from all Royals from King George V to Prince William and Catherine and Prince George. Diana's dresses were amazing and shown in large glass cabinets.The lady at the ticket office was helpful and most of the ship was accessible in my wheelchair - the tiny 1930's lifts were amazing! Sadly, the tea rooms were closed the day we visited, but it was interesting to eat lunch in such an historic restaurant. It was good to journey along the decks and view the decor of this old vessel and conjure up conversations from years past. It is such a shame that the paint is peeling from the outside of the ship and it is in need of some TLC. I feel that the City of Long Beach should be advertising this attraction more. It was difficult to find out if this exhibition was still there, and the signage when you arrived at the Quay was non-existent.",Janet C
50,"Queen Mary, a Local's perspective","The Queen Mary is an excellent place to go to see a nice piece of history, have a good meal, or go to the Art Deco Bar for a drink in the evening. It stirs the imagination. We go to Sir Winstons, the formal restaurant, for anniversaries or birthday events. The food is excellent. There are also many good events planned around the ship annually. As others have noted, the ship is very old and in need of maintenance. The City of Long Beach is not doing it's job in maintaining the ship, so more visitors and more comments put pressure to keep her from fading away.",Christopher M
50,Well Worth It!!,"I'm a huge fan of the paranormal, so the Queen Mary was a definite to do. I was a little disappointed in the haunted aspect, but I didn't do any of those tours.I did enjoy the history aspect of the ship though. It was so cool to walk up and down the halls and see what it would have been like to be a passenger. My little cousin wasn't too horribly excited at first, but I was telling him what I knew and he got more excited as we got closer.Several of us opted to take a tour of the Scorpion. That was also cool to see and read about.",Chelsea

40,Stately history and interesting time.,"We had just completed a 15 day Panama cruise from Fort Lauterdale and so it was very interesting to compare the current Island Princess to this stately old vessel. We lucked out and managed to get free admission because the Queen Elizabeth was docked nearby and it was celebration time. We started at the rear of the ship with the displays and worked our way down to the engine room. While we were there we met up with a lady passenger from the Queen Elizabeth whose father worked as a stoker on the Queen Mary many years ago, so that made some interesting conversation. After completing the engine room we made it to the Hotel and the upper decks. After spending about 3 1/2 hours we needed to move on so we did not get to finish the complete tour. Given the opportunity we would like to stay in the hotel and finish touring.",CloseONE
40,Queen Mary and Chill,"We came here around 1 pm on New Years Eve and stayed until the 4 pm. We paid about $40 per person for Chill, Queen Mary and Haunted Tour plus the parking fee. We took the 1:30 haunted tour, walked around the ship for an hour and then went to Chill. I thought our tour guide for the Haunted Tour was excellent, personable with a good sense of humor. There were some ghost stories online as well that he didn't mention. My engineer husband really enjoyed walking around the boiler room and electrical areas. There is also a small exhibit which has a cross section of the ship. We did get to walk around the ship for a bit but had to be off by 3 pm. We liked that although we did get lost a bit.I thought there would be more to Chill. The Ice Kingdom was nice with the ice scultures and ice slides, but unless you are going to be skating or sliding for a while, it is not worth the cost. I can understand that all food would be at an additional cost, but even the outside rides were additional money as well which I felt was unneccesary. We spent about an hour in Chill. If you have kids who want to skate or slide, it is okay, but not for adults who do neither.The good: haunted tour and Queen Mary classic ship, Ice Kingdom.The bad: additional charges for parking and rides at Chill.",angeleyes27
40,Back in tome,Spend the night if you can! Our room was much more spacious than I expected for an interior room. Beds were comfy and I can imagine traveling decades ago on a vessel like this. Amazing that there is so much storage space in the room - better than my college dorm room in the '70's! Had dinner and drinks on board. A bit pricey - but food was good. Try the chowder! We loved the Diana exhibit. The self guided tour was a bit confusing but provided a lot of details. I noticed some folks just sitting and listening to the narrative.,Deborah T
40,It's History!,"I've visited the Queen probably a half dozen times and at least 4 of those were as a guest in the hotel. Is it a 5 star hotel? No. Is it old? Yes. I knew all that going in. I don't expect it to smell brand new, It sits in the water! Some rooms are a bit small and some a bit larger and all, so far, seem unique. The only issue I really had was a couple stays ago the Wi-Fi wasn't very good in the room but I will stay there again, for sure. The first time I saw the Queen was in New York in 1964. My late father made sure we saw it. He was on the gray ghost, during WWII.",Ron V
40,"Fun, but happy we got discounted tickets","I was very excited to go and view the Queen Mary as I like to cruise and had never been on an older ship like this one. It did not disappoint. I don;t think I would like to stay on it as a hotel, but it was good for a visit. Prices at the gate are expensive for what you get, but we were able to get a deal for 5$ admission. 15$ for parking is outrageous though.",Mike S
40,Impressive Ship,Went on a weekday so we avoided the long lines. It seemed a bit expensive but we included the Russian submarine in the package.The tour was quite interesting and detailed. The guide was quite informative and willing to answer all questions and also some facts which are not well known. We saw the hotel which seemed like a great place for a weekend getaway.The tour of the submarine was very interesting. It is self guided so you get to spend as much times as you want looking at the ship and how life was spent in the confines of such a small area. Not for the claustrophobic.All in all an interesting day and worth the money.,Harlan R
50,Plan to spend the day.,"If you want to see everything that is here, I would plan to spend most of the day. There is a lot of information to read, see, and hear about. It was a great way to spend the day since we had to be close to the airport just in case.",Adam B
50,Enjoyable sights!,"A must see also a Hotel on Board! lovely sightseeing must if you are out to Long Beach, California. Restaurant, hotel, tours, and so much to do there.",Buncy Pagely
40,Great old ship,The Queen Mary is an interesting old ship with lots of history. It is decked out in Art Deco style from 1936 but also portions display later years. The Bob Hope display is really awesome. Take the audio tour as it is well done.,Chiefly1
40,much better than i expected,"while in ca to attend the rose bowl parade, we decided to make a side trip to spend the night on the queen mary. i dont really know what i was expecting, but it far exceeded my expectations. we arrived at check in time and had to wait a couple of hours to get our cabin. while we were waiting we had a drink at one of the bar's on board, very reasonable and ok for a glass of wine! when we finally got to our room it was pretty neat. the room was big and the bathroom had faucets for sea water or fresh water. the clawfoot tub was much narrower than ones today, maybe the folks were skinnier in those days. two in our party went for the ghost tour that night. they said it was a joke. we all did the lady di exhibit and it was amazing. it took a couple of hours to go through and i could have spent more time there. the next morning we had the breakfast buffet and the service was outstanding. the food was ok, but we were allowed to order off the menu as well, and that food was very good. we then did a tour of the ship which made the entire experience worth it. we then toured a russian submarine which was next to the ship. the package that we got included our room, breakfast, lady di exhibit, and the ship tour, and the submarine tour. all in all it was a great experiencer. oh, yes the gift shops had everything half price. got some nice adult t shirts for $10. i would recommend this to others. it was really interesting how the rich traveled back in the day!",vetmom22
50,OH MY...A Flash back in time....incredible,"We toured the Queen Mary and what an experience it was. The history, the stories and just the Awe of being on this vessel is mind blowing. Just amazing this majestic creation is still around. The QM has hotel rooms, restaurants and exhibits which is second to none. So Cool.....you can spend a whole day there sight seeing. Worth the time.....",Tom F
50,Fine Restaurants/Great Historic Time Piece,"From the moment you step unto The Queen Mary, you sense a great time in history. It's as if is a time capsule, preserving a moment of history between England and The United States. They have two fine restaurants, both offer excellent food. If you care for a drink, you can visit the Observation Bar. Sitting at the bar, you can imagine the splendor and beauty that many, many, of the rich and famous people that have sat in the spot that you are sitting on. A must go to place for historical and fine dining value.",Wandlust
20,So little for so much,Over all i would not go again there is no free parking if you stay more than two hours it will be 15 dollars. If you buy your ticket at the ticket booth there at the Queen Mary they will charge you a 2 dollar service fee per ticket which is already costing you around 30 dollars. the tours were nice the guides had a lot of knowledge of the ship the historical tour lasted around 30 mins which seems kind of short to me. I also did the ghost and legends tour which happened to be down during the time i went but they still do the tour at the same price even tho you don't get the entire tour.,Blas C
40,Worthwhile,"While it is a little touristy, it was worth seeing to imagine how cruising was different from today. It was interesting to see the rich and famous who made the voyage.We had lunch in the casual restaurant looking out at the water. The food was good, but the restaurant didn't have the feel of the period, which would have been nicer. Much of the ship does retain the period decor.",Lee F
50,Queen Mary,We had been On a cruise and before flying back east we stayed an extra day and visited the Queen Mary. We walked around and marveled at the great beauty of this old ship. I loved going through the Diana Exhibit too. Wish I had more time to do the ghost tour!,Lisa S
50,A memorable experience,"Just love stepping back in history to the time when ships were like palaces. I would have love to travel on a vessel like the Queen Mary. It's sad, we became too rushed that air is our main means of travel.",Ellen J
50,Third year for self tour of Mary and the Chill Attraction,"Well year three for Chill and the Mary.... First the Mary ... found a lot of things on board somehow either missed or were added from previous years... interesting to read some reviews on here... not sure what these people expect... yeah they could redo the ship to look like it did originally but would you really want to stay in those conditions either... the rooms are better now than they were then really, at least the ones that are operational... Was disappointed that all the shops were closed and under renovation... this could make some of the complainers happier with new shops and new bobbles, but it concerns me that no authenticity is lost in this remodel. In any case, still love the ship...Now regarding parking as i do every year i must complain about the mandatory 20 dollar parking cost, it's outrageous and they know you don't have any real choice since no alternative parking outside of the Mary is realistic.CHILL.... awesome as always... this was the last day.. a rainy day i might add... for this years event... but still enjoyed CHILL.. some of the outdoor parts were under water on this day but people were still skating.. and nice thing on last days gift shop was highly discounted. The ice sculptures were tweaked as they were every year and the Queen Mary with it's ice slides noticed was completely redesigned.... over all just a great yearly event thank you.One more thing... the responders from the Queen Mary on here are great suggest people read their comments... they have an amazing ability to respond positively to the most negative comments while making their points lol... they also manage to focus on any positives you say while completely ignoring anything negative a reviewer says... nice job QM responders ! you do you job well on trip advisor.",northernk
40,Had a great time!,"My husband and I really enjoyed Queen Mary as we arrived to a very glorious and beautiful ship. We used our LAGoPass to zip through the line and made our way up to the ship. It was a very interesting audio narrative tour that you do at your own pace. It will take you all across the ship (some almost go back and forth quickly) so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. It allows you to pause if you feel like exploring other parts of the ship. It was a bit awkward at times because you would sometimes get lost as directions weren't always clear. Usually takes about an hour and a half. We also stayed for lunch, and really enjoyed ourselves. Reasonably priced, and good service. There’s lots of neat exhibits to do. We did the Ghosts and Legends Tour, which takes you below deck and into the boiler room (in complete darkness) and engine rooms etc. They make a bit of a show out of it. I was creeped out at a few parts (probably because we were 50 ft. below sea at one point) but it was fun and really neat none-the-less. They’ve got all sorts of nice shops and plenty to see. We were there for a few hours. As an admirer of luxurious ships (Titanic), I enjoyed myself but I could see how it might not be totally appealing for everyone.",Jennifer R
50,A MUST PLACE TO VISIT IN LONG BEACH,"First of all, don't pay full price but get a BOGO from Groupon on line to save money on admission. Once you've accomplished that just enjoy your trip through time on board The Queen Mary. The tour through the ship gives you a great history lesson but the high light for us was Princess Diana exhibit. It is there for a limited time so go soon!!",JoAnne W
30,A ho hum attraction....,"We came to the Long Beach area specifically to see the Queen Mary attraction. From a distance the QM looks so regal. I love the history of this ship, read about it and you'll want to see her! Since my visit there today I can't get it out of my mind. The visit to the QM was so disappointing. We chose the self directed tour and it was like visiting an abandoned ship. First, they need some volunteers who could show you around, point out the highlights of the ship. The vibe of the attraction is lacking in energy. The ship looks tired, I imagine it costs a fortune to upgrade the ship, but, the attraction needs something, like some enthusiastic volunteers to make you feel good about spending $30 for a few hours aboard this regal ship. I feel shortchanged. We had planned to have lunch aboard her, but the restaurant was empty and it just didn't look like a place I'd want to have lunch. It has so much potential and the tour could be so much more fun.",Barbara Jayne M
30,Skip the audio tour,"The audio tour is the worst. The information is interesting but the directions they give are terrible and you'll spend the whole time wandering up and down stairs trying to find your way to the next stop. They should give you a medal for finding the last stop on the tour (the propeller - very impressive btw).Also, we found ourselves standing right near the foghorn when it went off without warning at 3pm. Needless to say we nearly had a heart attack. We later found a tiny sign saying when it's scheduled blast times are. Small children and the elderly beware.",Amanda K
50,Take a tour,"We signed up for a tour, but had several hours to wander about in public area. Our tour was about the QM being a group ship during WW2 other tours included ghost tours. Took about 1 1/2 hours 0ur tour guide was very informative ( a past ship captain) and he involved the entire group in his questions. Great guide",Barbara B
50,Spend the Night,"Having sailed on one of the QE2's last transatlantic crossings, we wanted to see the Queen Mary. A magnificent ship, the tour can take several hours. We got a deal on an outside cabin and spent the night. Had dinner at Churchills and breakfast on the promenade deck.",Mzznlink
10,Don't waste your time,"It starts with a drive into the Port of Long Beach, dodging semi's, changing lanes and navigating the ""working"" side of the LA freeway network. ""Boy, this had better be good"" I'm thinking. She looks impressive from the outside. Once you get in the peeling paint, smell of cooking, broken lifeboats and general dilapidation starts to dawn. The day we visited more of the ship was closed off than available. Trying to order a coffee and morning tea was a fiasco. This ship experience is the complete opposite to the USS Midway experience. A real shame, our biggest disappointment on a three week tour of California.",ScottandLorna
30,Don't think the Queen would sail in this ship,"Despite the fact you are seeing a bit of history, I felt it was a real let down. I've seen a lot of historical places and some how this does not have the aura. It just seems like a run down ""boat"". The past glories of the is ship are missing. It's just oh hum. Perhaps, on a special tour it would be great but in May it was just missing the feeling of a regal, exotic, special ship. There were Ball rooms that were just storing furniture. How disappointing! Non of the suites were open to see what they looked like. It was easy to get lost because signage was so bad. All in all I didn't think it was worth the time and money. They are need a really good curator that loves that ship and the era!",Grandmaleslie
50,A truly big Ship!,"When in L.A. make sure you visit the Queen Mary. You need the better part of a half Day for this.It will set you back many Years when this type of travel was truly a Luxury!We had our visit in the Spring of 1988 and it included the Spruce Goose, however this attraction is no longer there.",JAK007
30,Its a boat!,We went onto the boat for a walk around. Once on board you could spend ages in there going through every detail but I think you are better placed (assuming you are not a history buff) to just stroll around the top decks and enjoy the view and the atmosphere. Its very quaint and enjoyable.,Steven W
50,Ghost tour was a blast!,Really enjoyed the ship and history. Had a great guide for the ghost tour. Even got a spooky picture! Would do it again!,DonMcKay
50,Beautiful ship...Confusing tour...Check for packages online,"Having sailed on the new Queen Mary 2, which is one of the most beautiful ships afloat, I was curious to tour the original. Before you go, visit their website and review the numerous packages they offer. There are a lot of options and it can be very confusing if you wait and try to do it at the busy ticket booth. You can also purchase online and save time. Special discounts such as military are only available at the booth. You can tour the Queen Mary, the Russian submarine Scorpion, the USS Iowa (which is docked about 7 miles away), and do several special exhibits such as Princess Diana, Ghosts of the Queen Mary and so on. You get a no-charge audio device at the point where you board the ship. I recommend it as it tells you a lot about the ship and gives you some aid in finding your way around the ship. The ship is an active hotel, so it can be very difficult ""navigating"" around the ship to do the tour. There is not much logic to the tour and you enter and exit at several different points. Even if you get lost, you will find lots of interesting spots on the ship and you can key any any audio site as you reach it. Be sure to visit the shops area where tourist and guest can shop and eat at several stores, restaurants and cafes. I enjoyed the tour but did go the wrong way several times. There are a lot of stairs but you can backtrack to the main elevators in the lobby to get to most decks (but not the engine room). Best advice is plan ahead. Not a good attraction to visit on the spur of the moment. Parking is in addition to the entry fee. Entry fee varies based on package you pick.",Tennessee50plus
40,Free tickets with Chill!,Basically if you visit the winter wonderland called CHILL on the docks in front of the QM then you get a free entry pass onto the boat for a walk around.Once on board you could spend ages in there going through every detail but I think you are better placed (assuming you are not a history buff) to just stroll around the top decks and enjoy the view and the atmosphere. Its very quaint and enjoyable even for kids who can run around a bit.,Sidji
50,Chill at Queen Mary,"My daughter (11) and I went to see this. Pricewise, I was expecting a $100 day, and it was about 1/2 that. The ice sculptures are maintained in a enclosed area that is sub-freezing. Words can describe the temperatures, but words cannot describe the ice sculptures. They have to be seen to be appreciated. There is a vast number of them. They are huge. From giant Surfing Santa sculptures to fairy tale castles and, of course, an ice sculpture of the bow of the Queen Mary. The ice is beautifully colored and enchantingly lit. Truly stunning. Afterwards we got a hot chocolate for her and a coffee for me, $3 each (I expected to pay $5 and that is one reason I avoid attractions like this). The sledding runs are a kick in the pants, don't miss them just because you are an adult. There are 2, one with sled tubes and the one through the ice sculpture of the Queen Mary's bow. We enjoyed the little ice rink even though it is small, cramped, crowded and the surface of the ice was poorly maintained, but it was included in the entry fee. There is also a carnival type ride in the middle but that costs extra. We did not eat there, which no doubt saved us a lot of money, but the food looked great.",LBGrandBanks
10,A huge rip off. A total waste of time and money.,The ship is in poor shape. The tour is garbage; the worst that I have ever encountered. The rip you off at every stage- eg $15 to park + $29 just to see the ship + $2 extra fee because they can. The tour is totally disorganized. There is no signage. You cannot tell what deck yiu are on. My mistake- not to check Trip Advisor before going. The audio guides are placed poorly at the far aft end of the ship and you have to walk up and down banks of stairs to get and return them. Recommend it to people you hate.,whisper123
20,New Years Eve,"We went to the event with high expectations. When we purchased our tickets, we were told it was black tie. We were taken aback on our arrival when we saw people dressed in everything from black tie to gym attire. We asked as we were checking in and were told that it is supposed to be black tie, but they didn't want to offend those showing up dressed otherwise. Well, I was offended. Once we made it through the crowd to get on board, out friends checked their coats. When they went back later to get them, they found the racks had fallen over, losing all the tags in the process. We went to get dinner in the grand buffet. We were seated, but could never get any of the staff to even get us some water. After chasing down someone clearing a table, we finally got some water, but forget any refills during the entire dinner. The food was average buffet food, definitely not worth the price. When getting desert, someone ahead of me took the last piece of cheesecake. I asked if there was anymore. The attendant said she would check and came back saying that was all they had. running out wouldn't have bothered me, but as we left, weasel the buffet line on the other side of the dining room and saw it had stacks of cheesecake. As far as the bars go, we tried four different ones during the night and the least amount of time to wait for a drink was thirty minutes, even in the VIP only areas. One person commented this would be a great place for an AA meeting because you'll never get a drink. The only good thing was the fireworks show was spectacular. While I can say I have rung in the new year on the Queen Mary, it was a major disappointment and definitely wasn't worth the price.",FinzA1A
40,Interesting glimpse into past,"Enjoyed boarding Queen Mary and browsing shops (which are moving very soon.) Banquet meal was fun as held in ship's ballroom, but food was only okay, not great.",MO8ball
30,Queen Mary,"Interesting tour to see this old ship but was expecting a little bit more. Would have loved to look more below deck, to see the old cabins from 1st to 3rd class. The guide was amusing and easy to listen to. We had afternoon tea in one of the restaurants and it was delicious.",Birgittaswe
40,Solemn,"I visited QM with my family. Before that we went to see the Russian Scorpio. It's an awful awkward thing, presented as if the Russians were threatening the world with that. (See my comments to Scorpio).QM is different. Before buying the tickets think if you really need all those options. We bought a full ticket but used one third.It's a hotel, souvenir shops, place to see and enjoy the harbor, learn some history. You may take an audio guide and be on your own or have an organized trip with a guide. It's very long and you never notice the time, especially if you're with kids.Go and see it.",Kamo P
30,Interesting Way to Spend a Few Hours,"Worth the time to see if you have time. Took the ferry over so it was a pleasant trip given the beautiful weather. This ship actually has a very significant history of transporting soldiers during the war but I didn't see any exhibits on this. There is a Princess Diana exhibit with some of her gowns, and a smaller exhibit with Princess Katherine's maternity clothes from Baby George. Lots of historical clippings on the Royals. Some people stay on the ship as a hotel but I have no interest--it's very yester-year.",Angela0607
20,New Years Eve on the Queen Mary,We waited in line in freezing weather despite paying the extra $ for 1st class treatment. ($199 each!) They should have put up a large tent with heaters. We also never knew exactly what was paid for and what wasn't. Various crew we asked didn't know either. There was no where to sit and eat or be comfortable. Reservations were needed for the restaurants (we never read this or knew about it). The crew was not particularly friendly or welcoming or helpful. The fireworks were very good and extensive at midnight. I would not recommend this or attend again unless it was FREE!,Beth M
50,Some Ghosts and a Singapore Sling,"So while on a work trip, I had some time to the sights in Long Beach. What should I want to do but visit a Haunted Ship! I decided to take the free shuttle that roams around Long Beach. It was mostly full of the Elderly and it got me to where I was going which was great. I bought my tickets for the ghost tour and decided to make my way aboard. Before the tour started, I was asked to pose for pictures with props (these were made available for purchase later). The tour guides were great and very knowledgeable about the Queen Mary's History. No Spoilers, but there was a point where we were made to walk through (hopefully) fake spider webs which wigged me out a bit, but hey, that comes with the territory when seeking out the paranormal on a ship. I definitely recommend the tour. Afterwards, I visited the gift shop and spent way too much money on sparkly bird statues. I then decided to get a drink at the bar. The bartender made a fabulous Singapore sling after which I walked around for a bit before departing. Over all I spent about 3 hours aboard. Something fun to do if you've got some time and some cash.",Sarikagoesplaces

50,Winter getaway,"We were in southern California the week after thanksgiving and enjoyed the uncrowded sights, including the Queen Mary. In about 3 hours we took a tour (with only 3 other people!) and had the run of the ship with the self'guided audio tour. It was a windy cool day after a rain, but as a guide reminded us, the Queen Mary was built for this type of weather. Even the parking was easy.",love-2-travel6319
30,If you like screaming badly manored children,"And their equally classless parents, then this is your place. Nice old boat very charming. However any chance of taking in the nostalgia of times gone by, where people dressed up and had class, is not to be. 99.9% of the folks should be in steerage and stay there!",westlinn
40,Passing by,"I was going over the weekend to take a cruise, which need to wait a couple hours for start boarding, next to it walking distance was Queen Mary, so we decide to stop by, after paying for the entrance we start walking all over the place, interesting place, but to get to see some other exhibitsYou must pay separate.. Overall pretty cool place to see.",cintuchi
20,Very expensive/not a lot to see,"The ship has seen better days. Paint was peeling, railings were rusting, shops did not look like they get a lot of business. Tickets were way over priced for simply being able to walk around a couple of floors.",95678
10,Queen Mary New Year's Eve is a waste of money!,"First of all, I presented my ID to a few of the staff at the entrance and no one looked at it. One women even said, ""I don't care about your age, just that you paid.""We bought the general admission tickets ($99 each). The place was so overcrowded with NOWHERE to sit (unless you paid $100 for a small ottoman to sit on), and the attractions were awful. No one really knew where to go or what to do, and lots of people were turned away at the event rooms because they were filled to capacity.QM will tell you ""Well, you were warned that this event sells out every year."" Whether or not 100% of tickets were sold has nothing to do with providing enough space and available attractions for the people that purchase them. If you have 50,000 people (random number), then the event should accommodate this. Nothing is included. Food is separate, seating is separate, parking is $20. This is the price of a Disneyland ticket for half the time and a fraction of the space.And they give the same standard reply on all bad reviews. This event is a rip-off. This was my first and last time. Don't waste your money!",Rosaria M
10,New Years Eve Party 2014,The worst experience ever. Staff was not informative at all about the event and as a result not helpful and gave incorrect information. I would give it zero stars if I could. Would not go back as it was a waste.,Camilla w
40,Review of CHILL and Queen Mary,"This review includes the CHILL experience because that's the main reason we went. Very fun day with kids in tow. The best part were the ice slides, because the line wasn't long my kids went over and over again. The Ice Kingdom was just ok, I was expecting more. The ice sculptures were amazing I guess I just wanted more of them. We didn't get to ice skate because the line was ridiculously long. Even after leaving the CHILL area and touring the Queen Mary the line was still too long to wait in. Now on the Queen Mary herself. This is a fantastic historic ship. We did the self guided tour and it took us a few hours to do the entire ship. Tip: If you want to get to the engine room go down to level R, walk off the ship, hang a left and then walk across the walkway and through the doors.",NTC214
20,NOT ADA COMPLIANT,"Went to Queen Mary ship with young kids and 79 y/o grandpa. We asked the bellhop on front door whether they provide wheelchair. He said, ""yes go to 3rd floor. So we went to 3rd floor and asked the bellhop there and was directed to the front desk. Fell in line to the front only to be told that they do not have wheelchair and to ask security in the first floor. I asked the front desk how come the employees are not aware of where to get a wheelchair and was just given a shoulder shrug.Once inside the ship, there is no clear directions on what to see. There are no posted signs as to where to start the self guided tour. The management should have prepared for the influx of visitors as it is Christmas break. They should have trained the staff on what to answer. This is California, they should be ready to provide wheelchairs to those in need.There are also no signs in the parking exit where people who has cash or use credit card can leave to get the line moving.We have been to several ships-turned-museum where one can really appreciate the splendor of the ship. Where there is organized chaos so people can really get their money's worth and truly enjoy the outing and learn about the attraction.My kids like going to museums but this is the first time they left without learning about what made queen Mary special.Total waste of time and money.",Jennifer D

40,Ghosts and Legends Tours,"The Ghosts and Legends Tours are a grouped together when you buy a ticket, and it is well worth it. The first one tells you the story behind the ""haunting"" and the second is a special effects treat.

40,The Aging Queen,"I am an ocean liner enthusiast, therefore, to me, the RMS Queen Mary is the Holy Grail of destinations! The RMS Queen Mary is one of the last remaining ocean liners from the golden age of ocean liners! It is very rare for these ocean liners to be kept up as well as the Queen Mary has been over the years. That being said, there are some negatives to this destination.Firstly, if you have difficulty walking around, this is not the destination for you! A visit to the Queen Mary requires ALOT OF WALKING! There are many walkways and stairs in this old vessel! If you want to see everything there is to see, then you should be prepared to WALK!!!Secondly, this ship was built for Northern Atlantic crossings and, therefore, does not have air conditioning. While coastal Californian weather is known to be comfortable, inside the ship, it can get rather warm. Please dress accordingly.Finally, in order to fully appreciate this visit, you must think, while you are there, of what this ship was like in its glory days. Today, I am afraid, it is full of souvenir shops and the glitz and glamour of this once beautiful ship have faded away to reveal an aging queen. Do not get me wrong, this ship is a wonderful example of art deco architecture and the golden age of ocean liners. I should say, I have recently read that the owners of the hotel have recently taken steps to fix the above mentioned issues. I urge the city of Long Beach to continue to protect and preserve one of their few (and most well known) landmarks!",Andy T T
30,A Disappointment!,"We may have hit this on a bad day (a Monday) but the liner looked rather down at heel and a bit scruffy, definitely in need of refurbishment. The entrance fee (plus parking) was rather high considering not all state rooms were open. I'm glad I've seen it and definitely got the feel of the size and old grandeur of the ship but overall was rather disappointed. The saving grace was the Diana Exhibition. This was not just about Diana but the Royal Family as a whole. We saw more Royal Family memorabilia than we have ever seen in England and the whole exhibition was really good.",ruth44421
40,The Lady needs some work,Although this treasure clearly needs some work - I did truly enjoy my visit - by pass the childish tours unless you are traveling with kids - and spend the day roaming the halls and decks of this amazing ship. The shops are truly unique and amazing - I found a family coat of arms in the Scottish shop and the Tea Shop was full of amazing and beautiful tea items. I had lunch in the Tea Room where they were happy to accomodate my dietary needs - Gluten Free - and introduced me to an amazing Chai Tea!,Travelgenie1963
50,A trip back in History,"I was able to walk around the ship and enjoy the pictures, antiques and ambiance. I was unable to get an escorted tour, but I would highly recommend it as there is a lot on the ship for history buffs.",kaberk

You have the view of all of long beach port and city from any table in the restaurant, The food is one of the best British cuisine in Los Angeles. The beef wellington is delicious and its made to order and cook to your taste. The mix from the bar are exquisite. This whole ship makes you feel like you are in the titanic. Its just an amazing ship with many places to go and spend the whole day or night. Its great for romantic couples dinners or first dates.",Therealtrue
40,Fun,I have rented rooms so many times on the Queen Mary to watch the fireworks great place to watch friendly atmosphere just good fun and when you're done you go to your room. Moved out of state came back I'll have to check and see if they're still doing that good memories.,Carmen G
40,History in the Harbor,"With a few hours to kill in Long Beach, I thought I would take a tour of the Queen Mary, and was glad I did. This place has so much history. Took a tour and the guide really knew his stuff.Tip - do the Queen Mary exhibit in the stern first and grab a guided audio tour. It adds to the experience when you tour later.",OziDiver
50,Ghosts!!!,"I'm an amature ghost hunter, so obviously I was gonna bring some equipment. I went on one of the ghost tours and I convinced the tour guide to let me use my equipment. First we used a ghost box (a hacked AM/FM radio with a voice recorder) in the first class pool. We heard the words child, drown, and Anna, which I'm presuming was the child's name. The boiler room was probably the creepiest part, and as soon as I entered I wanted to leave right away. Anyway, the ship was very cool. It had lots of cool history, and after my experience I'm starting to believe the ship really is haunted. Will definitely return.",Ellen R
30,"Nice ship and submarine, long ticket line, $20 parking!","We went there for a short visit. I made a mistake not buying a ticket online. To buy the ship tour ticket I had to wait an hour in a line in 86F direct sunlight. If we visited only the submarine we there was not line - you could buy the ticket at the gift shop at the entrance to the submarine.The ship was nice and well kept. I would have even spent the night there has I known about it before we reserved some other hotel. The elevators inside the ship are used for hotel use and there is a elevator tower outside the ship, which is always full of people you never get to get in. With our infant in a stroller we had to climb down the stairs.The parking charge of $20 is outrages. No where it was mentioned and we learned the price when we were leaving the property. This is ridiculous given the tours are sold just above this price. It may be justified if you are car pooling but for a two people with an infant it made no sense to us.",RanilB5
40,winter wonderland,"We went to wonderland event. We slid on tubes, and on the ice slide. We also ice skated but the ice was bumpy and grooved. very difficult to sake on. the ice sculptures were amazing.",Dyan C
20,Chill: Disappointed :(,"I got a groupon at $20 for this Christmas event and took along myself and two kids. I found the whole thing poorly organised and somewhat tacky. The ice kingdom was spectacular but it sounded bigger and better in the advertisement when we went inside it was small, slides were also small and lines were long, unless you purchased a pricey ELF pass. Took my kids ice skating which was included in ticket cost, had to stand in line for a long time and then they charge for the little helper penguin for the smaller kids. All in all I found this event poor. They also had an original ride from Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch at the event but again it came with a cost, as did parking, at $20 I thought this was pretty steep. I understand that a portion of the cost goes towards the upkeep of the QM but I felt this event was pricey even after buying discounted tickets, I don't think I got my money's worth that's for sure. Santa closed for a while so my kids were upset about that also. The highlight of the night was seeing the Queen Mary from the outside, but we had little time to go inside and there was confusion about what we could see inside anyway with our ticket. I think I'll give it a miss next year.",Sciems14
40,Knowledgable Guide,"We went to the Queen Mary for supper and a guided tour as a part of a conference we were on in Long Beach. Our dinner was excellent, and the guided tour afterwards was very interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, and was able to answer all of our questions. He did a great job making the ghost stories come alive, without being overly dramatic. We all learned a lot about the ships history that night, and enjoyed walking through the old halls, imaging what it used to be like when it sailed the ocean!",AlbertaBound0
50,I love this place,"I have been coming to to Queen Mary since I was small. It just gets better every time. This time we got the Haunted Tour and the Princess Diana tour.

30,Spooky not at all.,Ok being a medium clairvoyant I was so pumped up to do the paranormal tour $75 11-3am tour. Well what a great disappointment felt jilted not even did we see some fakery going on (security guard helping) but finding the recorder with the girls voice was a bonus. Don't get me wrong it was good to see the whole ship but I think there has been no action from the ghosts who live on there for along time dormant. We had fantastic spiritual evidience in our room on deck 4. maybe we should of brought all those people in there. We do have some photos with faces and full body but we are making sure there real enough.The TV didn't work in our room the water taps did not work and freaking freezing when we first arrive.... but cameras and money went missing but later found.... rude staff and a very long walk to our room only one elevator. The ship is old it has history and what a better way to catch a cruise the next day. Food very expensive so take the free bus passport bus into town.,bigmamma53

50,Really terrific history,"I was skeptical about this, but I actually spent about 4 hours on the boat and really enjoyed being able to just walk around and experience it. The 1-hour tour was also excellent, though -- manageable number of people and a really good guide. The Russian sub is also fun. This looks like it would be a tourist trap, but it really isn't and is quite an amazing story. Reasonable price, too.",BuzzieFamily

We had a great time, walking around the venerable old ship, taking in the history, and enjoying a nice meal at Chelsea's, overlooking the lights of Long Beach. We capped it off with the Paranormal Ship Walk (my wife is really into that stuff). All in all, a fun evening!",Murray S
40,CHILL 2014 At The Queen Mary,"Though it still needs a lot of work in both upkeep and organization, you can tell the folks who now own the Queen Mary are trying hard to breathe new life into this grand old ship. We attended this year's CHILL festival on November 29, and found it to be much better organized than 2013. There are more carnival style rides and themed food stands this year, plus the addition of bar area dubbed ""The Beach Bar,"" with a real sand castle depicting Santa and friends. The Beach Bar also featured The Tiki Dollz, a song and dance group reminiscent of the 1940's girl groups. The Tiki Dollz later played on the stage outside the Dome where the ice sculptures are kept - though they were dubbed The Satin Dollz this time, and they were great. More benches and fire pits were added to the stage area, giving it a homey feel - though I feel the fire pits will be removed in the future due to liability concerns, which is a shame. The inside of the dome, where the ice sculptures are kept, is also better organized this year. The lines weren't very long, for either the Ice Kingdom ice sculptures or the ice tubing. We went right into the Ice Kingdom without a long wait, which made for a more pleasant experience. This year's ice sculpture depicted a surfing Santa, with waves and sand made of ice. There were also sculptures of a traditional Santa visiting a house, the Queen Mary with a series of ice slides, several Nativity scenes, and a return of the Ice Queen from last year. All of the sculptures were quite beautiful. Because it was not too busy we were able to better enjoy the Ice Kingdom.The entertainment continued on board the Queen Mary itself, though it was badly organized. It was advertised that there would be Christmas Caroling along the promenade, but we later found out the caroling wouldn't be held until later in December. No where on the web site nor the ship was this stated - we had to find out from guest relations after we waited for the Carolers to appear and they did not show up. We also waited for the Lifeboat demonstration, but that too was cancelled with no notice either on the website or the ship - we had to find out by asking guest relations. It would have been nice if there was a sign or announcement somewhere - anywhere - stating the cancellations of the demonstrations and the lack of caroling. Like I said: it's clear the Queen Mary is working hard to become a premier destination, but it still has a long ways to go.All in all it was an enjoyable visit, though a little costly. Some complain about the high cost of parking, but it's to be expected. I've been to hotels for a dinner and parking is $35 or more. Kudos to the Queen Mary for working hard to improve its offerings - I expect great things in the future.",Stephanie L
50,QUeen Mary,"As a historian, I particularly love having the Queen Mary as a Long Beach fixture. I have been on it many times for various events and for touring the ship. A particularly moving event was when the new Queen Mary II came to say hello to Mama and they tooted at each other. There were thousands of people all along the bluffs to witness the event. The Queen is stately and has lovely staterooms and banquet rooms. It is a fabulous piece of history to be enjoyed today.",hugomom
40,Observation Deck,Check out the observation deck on the Queen Mary. Cocktails are around $12 but the view is nice. You need to buy a ticket to any of their attractions or prepay $15 per person to get to the deck. This amount is applied to whatever bill you rack up at the bar.,ST. J

Rides, events, food in a small town setting. Jumpers, swings, ice skating, and an inner tube ride down a slope! There is an Ice Kingdom with everything made of ice but the line was so long we didn't get in to see it. The food is high priced. The shows are entertaining. Prepare for long lines. Parking is really high! Better to include everything in a package deal. I brought young kids and teens. Everyone had a good time.",teresa w
40,Historical,"We had a very nice stay at The Queen Mary mid November when my husband and I visited for my Grandmother's funeral. We decided to stay there because it was affordable in comparison to other Long Beach hotels. We both really enjoyed our stay due to the ship's historical background.Some of the positives was that it offered a good variety of restaurants and bars along with plenty of events and activities to choose from while on the ship. The ship is across a large shipping container yard (forgot proper name) on one side, and on the other you can view all of downtown Long beach. There is a bus that comes every ten minutes to pick up guests to take them downtown. You can also get on a boat I beleive to do the same thing. There are a few types of tour packages and one is automatically included with your stay as well as charged to your room which is the audio tour. The ship is basically a museum with rooms. We also liked our room and we were given a queen that had two windows which looked out to the water and city at no extra charge. The rooms and most interior areas of the ship have been kept and maintained in their original conditions. We appreciated that, but at the same time, I personally would have preferred updated toilets. Overall it was a beautiful area, safe, and we loved the outside decks. The staff is also very friendly.",Ruckj

The art deco décor puts you back in time. I was stoked to hear that you can spend the night here, something that is now on my bucket list! I watched the Ghost Adventures episode where they filmed on the Queen Mary and we were allowed to wander around, as long as we didn't disturb guests. It was a night I'll always remember and I definitely plan to return!",arienne410
40,Veterans Day Attraction,"The Queen Mary offered free admission to their ship and Russian sub on Veteran's Day and took advantage of it. The ship tour was extremely interesting and the Captain was entertaining and very informative of the history of the ship. Lots of exhibits, such as the Bob Hope Exhibit and Princess Diana. They also had a ghost tour onboard, which might be a little scary for younger kids but worth the tour. Beautiful ship and you can also tour at your leisure with audible headphones. The ship also serves as a hotel and you can stay in their rooms, very well kept and comfortable. They also have a gigantic Champagne Sunday Brunch. Would love to explore the possibility of staying there as many celebrities in the past have stayed there as well. Full of history, including Military and to present day. Be prepared to spend a full day. There are various shops, restrooms and eating establishments, as well as a fine dining restaurant noted for its seafood. Would definitely recommend.",rmybuffy

50,What a Majestic Ship!,"Our family purchased the Haunted First-Class Passports and toured the Queen Mary just a few days before Halloween. It was an awesome adventure! It pretty much scared the pants off of our 11 and 7 year old kids, but they loved it!The grand old ship is rich with history and elegance.During War II the Queen Mary's was transformed into a troopship. She was painted grey and dubbed the ""Grey Ghost"".Many famous people have sailed on the Queen Mary including Hollywood legends Bob Hope and Clark Gable. Also, royalty like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The most exciting passenger to travel on it as far as our family is concerned was my husband's grandfather when he came to America for the first time in the late 1940's.If you are in the Long Beach area, the Queen Mary is a definite must see!",Kay M
50,A Wonderful Experience,"We loved the Queen Mary, where we spent a night last June. My 4 year old son pronounced it ""better than Disneyland,"" and it cost about $140 for the night. We had two twin beds and our son cuddled up. The room was a wonder, with beautiful paneling and interesting compartments all over. It was so cunning and charming. The entire experience felt like a trip back in time. We wandered the ship, marveling, and didn't have time for any tours--so we didn't see the swimming pools or any of the other off-limits sections--and it was great fun. We had cocktails in a fabulous art deco bar--recommended, despite the TVs--ate lunch in a pretty lunchroom up at the front, and had dinner in a long, narrow restaurant. The food was decent but the ambiance so much fun. We also really enjoyed the fussy little shops in the arcade, where you can get great souvenirs, books, jewelry, and more. Overall it truly felt like a break from SoCal. Convenient to the Aquarium, and proximate to harbor tours. Special tip: We asked the staff to call us a car to get us to the airport and they hooked us up with a great driver who got us there at a reasonable cost.",KatyMike
50,Amazing,"I dot think that I would like this excursion but I did, we only went here as we were picking up a car at Long Beach Airport - but I am so glad we detoured. I really enjoyed our guide's tour, I hadn't realised how special this ship was, especially as it had been used in the war to carry (I think) 16000 troops - and that it was the fastest ship ever. I though it was also weird that the tour had been running longer than the ship has sailed!You could do the tour and then had free reign to walk around most areas.Very enlightening",Love To Travel
50,"Fright Harbor, awesome","Ship was eery and real, amazing to see how old this boat is, we went to Fright Harbor, it was so scary better than universal and cheaper, definitely recommend",Christina L
40,We enjoyed seeing this grand old Lady.,"We caught the free ""Passport"" red shuttle bus from the Long Beach and walked to the ticket office for the Queen Mary. We bought a few tickets, one for the Ghosts & Legends tour, The Glory Days tour and the Scorpion Russian submarine too. The submarine was great, we were the only ones going through at the time, and so took our time exploring all the nooks and crannies, sitting at the dining table and playing with the periscope. Next, on board the Queen Mary, we had two amazing guides take us through the tours (especially the Glory Days guy who was totally hilarious in his delivery on info, talk about living the part!). We got to see the first class cabins (with twin bathrooms) and dining room(famous for The Godfather among other films), and I think the ballroom too. I really recommend doing this tour if you want to get a better picture of the feel for the era. We're glad we came.",suerayAustralia
30,Queen Mary is not scary,"i hate scary anything! not a fan of horror movies, haunted mazes, etc! because i get easily scared! but this tour was not that scary. nor that interesting. not because the queen mary isn't interesting, but i felt playing up the haunted aspect of the ship is a desperate grasp at marketing. i went on a haunted new orleans tour several years ago, that i surprisingly enjoyed. so i expected something similar. but this felt a bit contrived. maybe because there was so much suffering and torture in new orleans that the hauntedness felt more intense. i felt like the queen mary is interesting historically and I didn't get to know a lot of things about it on this tour that I would've liked to know because they were so focused on trying to call up ghosts. on hindsight, i would've just gone on a history tour.",Van N
40,Ghostly Elegance,"I'd seen the Queen Mary featured on several ghost-hunting TV shows but had no idea that it was an actual hotel until a client of mine asked me to book him a room onboard. After mentioning this to my husband, he was sold and insisted that we spend a night on board the old ship during our weeklong stay in Southern California. It wasn't a hard sell.We arrived mid afternoon and found parking easily. Staff were very helpful in directing us where to go to board and check in. We found our stateroom easily, thanks to the map provided and directions from the employee who checked us in. The room was clean and larger than expected.My family set out to explore the ship and were pleasantly surprised that a self guided audio tour was included. We were most impressed by the fact that we could tour the ship and see areas not usually available such as the engine room, along with detailed historical information. Even my two teenagers were kept intrigued by areas like the isolation chamber, bridge and more.We dined at the Promenade Café and found the service and food to be excellent and reasonably priced. After dinner, we strolled the decks, sightseeing and exploring, while waiting for our Paranormal ship walk tour to begin. The tour was incredible! Tristan was a very pleasant, informative guide. My husband and I are interested in the paranormal and were both pleased that the tour was not full of special effects and fake knocks or taps. While nothing ghostly happened outright, we all learned a lot and explored some eerie areas of the ship. I will highly recommend this tour to my clients.",TravelAgentRobin
40,"Go for a meal, then have a look around","We had a short time frame for dinner so we purchased the obligatory $15 per person voucher that is redeemable at any of the restaurants on the ship. It was fun to see the large photographs on the walls showing all of the famous people who sailed on the ship and get a feel for it as a period piece. What was luxury in the hay day of this ship is not what we expect of our cruise ships today. We ate at the Chowder House ( not it's real name, but the word Chowder is in the name)which is the mid-price range restaurant. There are 3 restaurants. One is family style, and the other is more upscale. Our meal was delicious. The ginger grouper was top notch, as was our waiter.",Julie S
30,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to visiting the Queen Mary. We took one of the guided tours, which really only took us to the main area and explained a little about the history of the ship and what it was like as a cruise liner. I was more interested in seeing some of the inner workings of the ship and seeing an original stateroom. We enjoyed some of the views from the decks, and also lunch at the cafe, which was expensive but enjoyable.",zanzibar138
40,Aristocratic,"While its not a place I can spend all day at, it is worthy coming to see. There are often special events here and those are great experiences. If you want to do something special, it's a great place to host a party. We did that for my parents a few years ago for a major anniversary. The staff were very helpful and it turned out great.",am08540
20,What have they done to you?,"10 years since our last visit to QM. Boy what a difference. We love this old ship its a joy to ealk around a feel the many phases of her history.However ...Gone is is care and reverence to this old lady of the sea and in has come a cheapened commercial money making trashy experience (actually not so cheap!).We arrived the day after a halloween party night with deconstructing fairground and main walkway littered with broken glass, old sofas, rubbish and plastic cable ties. What a shambles.The onboard Starbucks is about as brand aligned as micky mouse in a museum and the defacing of ship walls with tacky halloween messages in luminous paint was just the pits.If you dont want her, hand her back.",Linda N
40,"Fascinating, although pricey","As a regular cruiser, I found touring the Queen Mary fascinating. It is amazing what was on a ship built in the 1930s and the wood and workmanship on the boat.I paid extra to see the Princess Diana exhibit, which was interesting. I enjoyed seeing her clothes. However, I am not sure I would want to see the exhibit again.I liked that you could walk around the ship at leisure and see areas usually not open, like the captain's quarters and the engine room. However, I am not sure if it was because of the Halloween mazes going on, but the ship could use some better signs and explanation.I took the history tour and my guide was informative and gave us enough time to see the rooms he was talking about. However, I wish we saw more of the ship.I ate in the Promenade Cafe and the food and service was good. You also get a discount on parking.At $35 plus parking the Queen Mary was pricey but very enjoyable.",CatsandShoes11
30,Intriging - service needs work!,"We went for a wedding and decided to stay in one of the state rooms. The room was pleasantly nice for being on such and old vessel but a bit pricy. They charge a 17.00 parking fee and a 14.95 charge for upkeep plus tax's and surcharges, totaled almost 80.00 extra. I had reserved the stay n play to get late check out, and was advised they were sold out at check in.This is one area they need to work on, the front desk was RUDE! We were there when they had the Holloween tours and was very busy but still no excuse! Depending on who you got to help you, depended on the level of service you received. We had a huge group and asked if we could all be put in the same area, which to no vail happend! The reception was very nice, had a great bartender, the food was really good but again, rude servers.....There was a homecomming dance next to us, so the bathrooms were packed and could not use, went looking for another and popped into the seafood restaurant just to ask where the nearest one we could use and got another RUDE jerk saying we couldn't use his bathroom......and we were asked to leave or be seated. We were told the following day, that if you were loud in your room you would be fined 250.00 and kicked off the boat....four of us were in a room and we got a loud knock on our wall, so beware! I understand if someone is disturbing your sleep, so we immediately left and went to bed. This rule is nowhere mentioned, so keep it in mind. You must take the time to do the audio tour, so much history. we only got to 2 areas and took 3 hours, there is a total of 17. I'm glad we were able to stay, check off the list and would like to go back and finish the tour......bottom line, is the Customer Service....NOT Impressed! Especially for a 300.00 night!",Dee W

50,Exhibits at Queen Mary,"The Diana Exhibit was more than expected! It is the history of the Royal families. Ramona, the person behind the desk to welcome you, is very knowledgeable and friendly. The displays are in detail starting with King George V and Queen Mary all the way to present Wills and Kate and Lil' George! There were newspaper clippings, plates, cups, clothing articles, pins, detailed stories about the houses/castles where the royal families live. Audio TV's were showing newsreel highlights, as well as many many glass cases of various items. Men and women will both enjoy this exhibit if you like history, like we do!",powersusa
30,Dark Harbor visit-Anticipation vs Reality,"Finally got up the courage to visit the ""Dark Harbor"" Halloween Event put on down at the Queen Mary in Long Beach. I was intrigued that the haunts were on the ship itself. In fact there were about 6-7 haunted mazes, but only two went onto the ship. We went mid-Oct, on a Sunday night hoping to avoid some crowds, but waits were still 30-45 min for most mazes. Glad we used the Amazon Local coupon, however if you have the cash, front of line tickets are always the way to go.Overall was a little disappointed by the event. They had very few ""scarers"" jumping out at you and the production value of the mazes was only so so. The best mazes were on the ship simply for the scare that it could really be haunted! but after doing a 45 min wait for one of the ship mazes, we werent ready to do it again for the second one.There is live music and dancing entertainment and fair like food and such. Port o Potty restrooms. Parking was $25 and there are really no other options. Keep that in mind when planning your Halloween fun. That ups the cost significantly. Carpooling recommended!I am glad i tried it out, but for someone who scares easily, i may keep my scare attempts closer to home.",jenandallthethings
40,The Queen Mary,"I wasn't sure about touring the Queen Mary. It is just a ship, but we went anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. Take the ghost tour into the boiler rooms. It was hooked but really kind of fun. You could wander all over the ship which was also very nice. We didn't see anywhere we couldn't go. The price was maybe a little high at $33, but we added the aquarium for $10 dollars more and that made the price not too bad. If you are in Long Brach I'd say you should go.",kskkgd
40,"History, Atmosphere and Food by the ocean... Why not","I have been on the old girl many times over the last 20 years and I always seem to have a good time. The many tours are interesting if you are a history buff, they offer a wide variety of restaurants from buffet on up to suite and tie. If you can stay in one of the original staterooms it is a real pleasure waking up and looking out your porthole onto the Long Beach skyline. The overall ship is a little rough around the edges but remember she is over 70 years old and the staff tries to update as much as possible. The observation lounge is great for drinks and has a patio.",Peter L
50,Queen Mary - Long Beach,"Visiting this was one of the highlights of the California trip, made extra special by the addition of a great exhibit of Diana memorabilia. We picked a fabulous time to go, no crowds at all no waiting in line, and plenty of parking. We had planned to do the USS Iowa in the same day but spent too long on the Queen Mary. It would have been really cool to spend a night here - maybe another trip. It was a fabulous experience, and great to see this ship so well maintained. We did a self guided tour and the headsets were not always working well, but we managed. It might have been worth while to pay a little extra and be guided by an expert. I am from England and had to hold myself back from spending too much money on English candy!",DiveFanDeb
40,Still a delight.,"this was our first visit in years - since the redo, the hotel, the champagne breakfast - and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The brunch was very good and the service great. We would really consider staying here if that awful beast Carnival cruise ship was parked directly in front. The comparison is striking.",LAHust
50,Grand Old Lady!!,"My husband was the one who really wanted to go to see The Queen Mary but am I glad I went too - had a great day exploring and listening in wonder to the wonderful narrative from our hosts and the self guided tour. We had the pleasure of being guided around the ship for the Historical Tour by Mr Roy Sorge, a lovely gentleman full of amazing stories of the ship mixed with personal experiences and a little dusting of mild humour!! I can honestly say he made our visit exceptional and if you have the opportunity to join him, you absolutely must!! He had such a wonderful manner about him, telling the children on the tour, stories and then gently asking them questions - just enough to keep them completely engaged!! He brought along colour copies of nautical symbols which he handed out and explained the use of them in both war and peace times - absolutely fascinating!! He really made the tour come alive especially in the areas you wouldn't normally get to see like the Queens Salon - his narrative was so detailed I could actually imagine being there and seeing everything he was describing. I don't think there is anything about the ship he doesn't know and his passion is very evident - simply wonderful!! Our second tour was a ghostly experience into the depths of the ship, was fun and our hosts Daniel and I'm sorry I forgot the other guy's name made it very entertaining and again really made our visit excellent!!! If you have a half day to kill in Long Beach - go see this wonderful piece of history!!",Snowbabies1
40,"The Queen Mary, Long Beach",An imposing sight as one approaches on the free Passport bus. It is not a short trip from Downtown to the Queen Mary - about 20 mins. She is in front of you with gangways and elevators (on shore) but not suitable for those with limited mobility - lots of stairs and you have to cover some of them 4 times! There are notices placed before you purchase tickets. Having the Audio tour collection at the beginning instead of going to the far end and then having to return to begin seems disorganised. The actual tour and vessel are living history and it is good to see her being used as a hotel as well as a tourist attraction. The audio tour is great except in the noisy areas around the air conditioning exhausts - maybe including warning to listen before moving off may help. Being on board reminded of a cruise on a similar wooden decked ship of English vintage some time ago. A really well worth it tour nd one can do it at their own pace. The Russian submarine was a bonus.,IJtraveller
50,Amazing,"What a fantastic day. The ship was amazing, beautiful Art Deco furnishings and décor a real reminder of how luxury travel used to be. The history of this ship is vast as is the ship itself. We did one of the tours and then explored the rest of ship ourselves. We were there for 5 hours but could have spent longer. Be aware that you cannot get to all areas of the ship and some are only accessible on the tours so do check if there are particular areas you want to see. The tour was good but a little theatrical and we would have preferred to cover more with less dramatics, however everyone is different and some people probably love it. Somewhere we would definitely like to come back to and perhaps even stay in the on board hotel.",Susie_Stevie
50,A Trip Into History,"We ended up staying overnight in the Queen Elizabeth suite. The room we had paid for downstairs was not ready when we went to check in so they bumped us up. We did the tour and wandered the other parts of the ship. It was so much fun to have the extra time to walk back in history and taking the time to read the plaques on the walls and the descriptions of the photographs. The art work, the lighting, the 57 types of wood they used-you never quite knew what you would see around the next corner. The food was very good and you could find choices in all price ranges, I had read a few reviews before we got there and several were complaining about that-it really was not an issue. Everyone on the ship was very helpful. My husband went on the sub tour and found it very interesting. We had been told that Long Beach was quaint-it's not quaint-it's a city. Driving through the LA traffic is still worth the trip! It's great for all ages.",Mya
30,Good,"A beautiful ship with great Art Deco pieces. We did the audio tour which meant starting at one end of ship, then having to go to other end via steps, venue was being set up for a big Halloween event, ending up back at the start area again via all the steps to see the engine room. I think this was just to drop the audio kit back.However did enjoy the tour, surprised how big the ship is. Some interesting facts. Went to the Diana exhibition which was good.Liked seeing the isolation room and the promenade deck.Did enjoy it but wouldn't visit again.",colcall
40,Great place to visit for history buff,"Stayed at the Queen Mary for one night recently and were completely thrilled with the experience. Love the complimentary guided tour, and got a fascinating history about the ship. Dinner was one of the best seafood meal Ive ever had. The service was excellent. Drinks after dinner at the Art Deco Observation Lounge was beautiful experience. The stateroom was large, and the bathroom quite huge. The whole ship is filled with lovely woodwork and stunning art deco artwork and other historical displays. Its really an Art Deco Museum as well as a hotel.",Russ Lacuata
50,QM Tour and Spruce Goose,If you ever happen in the Long Beach Ca area you can spend a great afternoon touring the Queen Mary and the legendary Spruce Goose next door. Can't recommend the hotel one way or the other but the history of the boat is dramatic. We went there in hopes of reviewing birth records for the 50's and were able to tour the dispensary. All in it was a great experience and would highly recommend it to couples and family alike.,will r
40,Day Tripping on the Queen Mary,"Last time my daughter and I were visiting L.A., freinds suggested we visit The Queen Mary. Spending the day on the liner with a trio of teens on the retro liner was fun. The public spaces were amazing. The tour of the ship was interesting. My own kid bonked part way through ""Haunted Ship"" tour and we had to take the emergency exit. Was it that scarry? Probably not, but you need to know your own kid. Food was expensive in the cafeteria and meh. Not sure how I would feel about having all the day trippers about if I was paying to stay on the ship. It would have been amazing to see the ship in her prime, but would love to have a chance to stay over night some time.",ElleAyeJay

50,Great way to spend a day,"Surprisingly relaxing Sunday at the Queen Mary. We purchased the Haunted First-Class Passport package* which includes two guided tours, audio tour, Russian submarine, and general admission.Note: Tours are scheduled for you depending on your arrival time. Your specific tour times are printed onto your tickets. They have limited space per tour, so it's first come, first serve as far as times go.Haunted Encounters Tour - historically rich tour that includes visiting the local haunt spots around the ship.Ghosts & Legends - A cheesy, but fun walk-through ""haunted house"" that goes around the ship. You get to visit some interesting rooms, such as the now defunct First-Class swimming pool. Tour guide was funny.Audio Tour is great and you can spend quite a long time listening to all of the information. I suggest stopping in the gift shop (outside) first to see the Russian Sub (10 minutes) before going onto the ship proper.We enjoyed drinks at the bar and a yummy lunch. It really can be a lovely, leisurely day if you take your time to explore, eat, drink and relax.* I believe there is a Groupon still available right now ; )",Katherine S
40,A Fun Walk Through History,"My grandfather was an airplane mechanic in WWII and came home from England on board the Queen Mary at the end of the war. For as long as I can remember, he had a newspaper picture of the Queen Mary loaded down with soldiers hanging on the wall. He could point out where on the ship he was standing, though there were too many men to really pick out his face among them.So: when my sisters and I decided to do a roadtrip in Southern California earlier this Fall, a visit to the Queen Mary was definitely making the list. We had an amazing visit and it was one of our favorite activities on the whole vacation.The ship is huge--larger than the Titanic. And it is still in amazing shape, with a lot of original fixtures! We took the audio tour (self-guided) which was very informative. It does require a lot of walking as it takes you all around the different levels of the ship and the whole length of it more than once. There are many stairs. Along the way, the audio guide tells you about the ship's original purpose as a mail & passenger ship and also about the war years when she was painted grey and used for ferrying troops around the world. Both aspects of the story are quite interesting. We also took one of the guided tours. We had a choice between a ""haunted"" tour or a ""historic"" tour and chose the historic tour. Our tour guide was really quite odd, and had a strange manner of speaking, but he was very knowledgable and kept the tour interesting. It took about an hour.We spent a lot more time on the ship than we thought we would, because it was so fun to explore. We also stopped in for a drink at the historic Observation Bar right at the front of the boat. It's a gorgeously decorated art-deco materpeice and a great spot for a gin martini. After all our exploring, we stopped in at the Promenade Cafe. This is probably the most afordable of the many restaurants on board (most are very pricy). We had a great meal with wonderful ocean views. My sisters and I shared a bottle of Queen Mary Sparkling Wine with our lunch which was a fun treat.The Queen Mary is also a functioning hotel, but we did not get to see any of the rooms. I would consider staying on board next time life brings me to Long Beach. I recommend this attraction for anyone interested in history, WWII, or ships in general. It was especially fun for us because we had such a personal connection with the ship since it brought our grandfather home from war.",JilliePepper
50,Unique Historic Opportunity Awaits,"You don't have to attend a special event or pay for a special tour to enjoy this beauty. Following our Sunday brunch in the dining room, we spent a couple hours walking around the ship, reading the information signs and taking in the environment. Several big surprises, including the machine gun! Who would have guessed this ship was used for a troop transport at one time. The whole ghost thing is an underlying theme to the ship and there are small signs posted throughout where guests have experienced various ghost encounters. Pretty cool. The shops are nice and the Art Deco bar up front is beautiful. The condition of most of the ship is great, but outside on the decks in some areas, rust is taking over as is floorboard rot and deterioration. However, I would recommend a visit to anyone who appreciates history. You don't have to be a ship and sailing geek to appreciate the time on board.",Tim O
30,"Interesting and informative, but could be so much better.","We visited Long Beach, and the Queen Mary, whilst staying in LA. We took the blue line metro from Downtown LA to Long Beach, which took about an hour and cost only $1.75.We were aware of a shuttle bus that runs from near the metro station down to the quay side where the ship is docked, but we chose to walk down. This turned out to be a bad decision as it was a lot further than we expected and the route is not very pedestrian friendly, or well sign posted. Take the shuttle!Once down there, we purchased our ‘Queens Passport’ tickets which included the self guided audio tour, along with an hour long ‘historical’ guided tour, and the ‘Ghosts and Legends’ tour. The two guided tours were booked for specific times. Also bundled in was a tour of the Russian submarine located next to the Queen Mary.Our guide for the first tour was an ex captain of the ship, a distinguished gentleman who was obviously very proud of his subject and keen to share stories and anecdotes, as well as more factual information. We were lucky to have him as our guide. We then had time for a quick drink in the beautiful art deco surroundings of the Observatory Bar, before collecting our audio guides.The content of the audio tour was informative and interesting, although I found the narration a bit irritating and cheesy (apparently spoken by a former Captains assistant). It covered some areas that we had already seen on the guided tour and some that we hadn’t, so it’s probably worth doing both. I was disappointed by the standard of the exhibits at the end of the tour. Reconstructed cabins of different classes, along with other items of memorabilia and comments from passengers who had sailed onboard were interesting, but were relegated to a dark, dingy, hard to find area that was really quite depressing.The Ghosts and Legends tour takes you through some of the areas of the ship that are supposedly haunted, or have reported paranormal activity. This is more of an experience than an informative tour, with our dour and monotone guide helping to add an air of anticipation and foreboding to the proceedings. The tour lasted about 30mins, and despite being a bit hammy, was actually quite well done, with atmospheric lighting, mist, sound effects and a few frights! Good fun.We had time for another drink in the bar, and were unfortunately served by a man who was downright rude and should not be working in customer service. His general attitude could not have been worse.Finally, we explored the Russian submarine. This is basically a walk through from one end of the sub to the other accompanied by narration piped through speakers. The actor doing the voice over was appalling and put on a hideous, cringe worthy Russian accent - I’d love to know why they didn’t just use a Russian! If you are not terribly mobile, or claustrophobic, you might struggle with the small spaces and tight passageways.I was also surprised to find some of the dining facilities closed. We visited midweek and it was fairly quiet, so i can understand why, but I think it should be mentioned on the website.In all we had an enjoyable visit. The Queen Mary has a unique and varied past, and it was interesting and enjoyable to hear about it, and imagine how it would have been to travel on board. For that reason she is definitely worth a visit. It is just a shame that some areas failed to live up to expectations, and I didn’t feel that she is being given the star treatment she deserves.",SuperTim69

50,Christened by royalty and a Queen forever in our hearts,"Eighty years ago on September 26, 1934, Her Majesty Queen Mary announced to over 200,000 onlookers, ""I am happy to name this ship the Queen Mary. I wish success to her and all who sail in her.""The massive giant previously known as Job #534 then rumbled down the shipyard slipway to begin what would become an extraordinary 31 years of active service. After permanently docked in 1967, she has for decades served as a hotel, museum and venue to countless events.I've been aboard several times and attended many functions hosted at her location. Late night parties, 4th of July fireworks, Dark Harbor, food festivals, midnight ghost hunting, Sunday Brunch, drinks at the Observation Bar, and romantic dinners at Sir Winston's and, of course, exploring the ship itself AND I still haven't finished everything there is to offer! She and I will most definitely have a long lasting relationship.In my opinion, the Queen Mary and her sister ship of that bygone era are unparalleled models of what a transatlantic luxury ocean liner is, was, and ever will be. Back when a ship looked like a ship. Her sleek structure and lines were made perfectly to slice through the ocean surface. Combined with her graceful and refined beauty her power and speed put her at the top of her class winning the Blue Riband award in 1936. I'll pass on the overstuffed multilevel floating hotels they call ships today. Comparing a record breaking Olympic swimmer to a fat kid in an inner tube is just simply insulting. Give me black and white riveted steel with bright funnels jutting skyward marking its strength any day of the week.I highly recommend visiting in the daytime and evening as the two carry very different vibes. In the daylight hours explore her colossal structure, admire her original artwork and art deco design, and learn about her past. She's up there in age and her lipstick may be askew here and there but if you're able to look beyond the minor imperfections, I assure you that you'll be amazed with the legend, adventures, tragedies, and history that lives within her steel walls.If you take the time to listen, she'll gladly to you her story.A perfect evening would include dinner at Sir Winston's followed by a nightcap at the Observation Bar. The restaurant's food and service are impeccable. Five stars all around. The OB, formerly the 1st class lounge, is art deco at its finest. The painting, Royal Jubilee Week, is still proudly and prominently displayed behind the bar.Stroll her teak wood deck under the stars where she takes on a quiet elegance. Lights twinkle in the sky above and along the serene coastline. Surrounding beauty both aboard and afar needs no words.Keep in mind the Queen Mary's structure, fixtures, and all her original artwork are at the mercy of a harsh coastal environment. This is not a temperature and climate controlled museum. Ongoing maintenance, refurbishment, and preservation is a perpetual necessity. I wouldn't even be able to imagine what the upkeep costs entail. Point being, parking fees and charges associated with the Queen Mary go towards a worth while cause. Just get your parking ticket validated or show a restaurant receipt for a discounted rate. Also, attending any QM signature event now allows you to board the ship free of charge. Making sure her makeup is presentable and her diamonds are shiny is not a cheap task.As for me, in the future I plan to try out things I haven't yet experienced. Stay overnight in the hotel. Toast in the New Year with the New Year's Celebration. Travel back in time and attend the Art Deco Festival. And yet again this still wouldn't fill my dance card with the Queen. There's so much to do and experience. I recently became an annual member which allows myself and a few guests free admission, free parking, tickets to events, and hotel/restaurant discounts. I'm glad to show my support and without question the card will get used frequently.In parting, I raise my glass and say:Thank you for your service in times of peace and during war.Thank you for being a continuous gracious host.Thank you for the smiles and memories you help create for those that cross your gangway.Thank you for your classic beauty that turns my head for one last look every single time I visit.So until we say hello once again...Cheers, Ol' girl !!",Joseph B
50,Awesome to see,"We did a groupon deal, with the submarine. Great deal to do both. We did the Haunted version of the tours, it was fun!",tiffany w
40,A Cruise back in time,"I'm cruising on the Star Princess and we stopped in Long Beach, right next to the Queen Mary. I decided to walk over to check it out (no charge when you show your cruise card.)What a beautiful ship. She's older now, and in some disrepair, but she's still beautiful. She must have been incredible in her hay day. There is so much wood. You get a real sense of luxury, pampering, and excellence.If you get a chance, tour the Queen Mary. She's an amazing ship.",212kathis
50,Fantastic,"Wow what history, we stayed there for one nite very nice roomsMeals are quite cheap, take a tour very interestingThe bar is incredible with its old décorGenerally a must too see",woody724
40,Dark Harbor at The Queen Mary,"I went to the Queen Mary in October for the Dark Harbor event. We got the general admission for $24. The price for parking was $20. We were searched and then showed are tickets so we could enter. Before you go in, you can take a commemorative photo that will cost $20 for the package. The first maze we saw was the Voodoo Village, the wait was an hour, but it was worth. Next we went to the Circus maze, we only waited 20 minutes for this one and it was great too. Then we went to the Deadrise maze, we waited 20 minutes and enjoyed this one too. We got in line for the Soulmate maze, this is one of the mazes that actually goes through the ship, the wait was an hour. The Soulmate maze was just OK. Next was the line for the Submerged maze, this one also goes through the ship, the wait was 45 minutes and it was just OK. The last maze was the B340 maze, the wait was an hour, and I think this one was my favorite. The food sold there is basically like carnival food, although it is a bit pricey. $13 for a turkey leg. Make sure to use the bathroom before you get there, they have porter potties. I would recommend going during the week, because it would probably be less busy. Tickets can be upgraded there for front(fright) of the line passes, but they sell out quick. All in all a fright filled and fun experience.",Nia E
50,One of the greatest ship,"If you are visiting LA or the area you must visit the Queen Mary! You can buy guided tour tickets or just walk around tickets. We bought the latter (combined with the submarine ticket) and wasn't disappointed! This ship is enourmous and beautiful! You can walk around the board, go inside, or up to the bridge and even go down to the engine area! If you always wanted to know what was like travelling on the Titanic or on similar ships this ship will make your dreams come true!",Gábor
50,Amazing place,"A place to enjoy the mysterious of an old ship where you can enjoy the view of the bay in Long Beach.I give 5 starts because the ship is very well conserved after so many years, there are many activities to do, launch brunch, juts walk, the tour; but unfortunately I should give less if include the place where the old ship os located.The area is desolated, I guess there is not too much visitors but the area close to the Hotel except for the tourist that embark on a cruise, nobody go there, I will suggest more investment from the Queen Mary or the local authorities to improve the surrounding area.",muertesss
50,Pricey Tour But No Regrets,"I grew up in So. Cal. and have been gone for over 35 years and I FINALLY toured the Queen Mary. Minimum admission is $27/adult which includes 1 tour and access to the various decks, on-board gift shops and restaurants. We took the historical tour and our guide was so animated it was comical. All the hotel rooms were booked solid so we didn't get to see one. I would love to stay the night! They also have a ghost tour.",HowellPartyof5
40,Still a good adventure,You should put this on your bucket list. Its historic and fun. The ship and the hotel have seen better days but its so much fun to stay there and the food at the restaurants are really good. You also get the benefit of getting tucked in by a mysterious entity in the middle of the night....jk.,Remy87
20,Wish someone else helped me.,"It's the time of the year where you don't mind the hairs sticking up on the back of your neck from the creepy things we encounter so what better way than to visit the Queen Mary. I've been on the ship before when I was younger and I remember having a hard time sleeping from the creeps she gave me so I wanted to take my girlfriend to experience the same chills. Upon arriving there was traffic backed up from the exits of the freeway and they directed us away from the ship and I got lost, I did a loop and came back to the same parking and then they let me in, got VIP parking and made our way to the ticket booth. (THIS IS WHERE IT GETS STRANGE...not in a good way) as we're waiting to get tickets to the ghost encounters I get to this very angry lady at the ticket booth and since there were ghouls walking around I assumed she was in character... But she was really just yelling at customers and making comments to make them feel stupid. It was my turn and after her shouting and banging on the glass for the next person in line I asked about the ghost enounters and she said ""You really don't want to do that because there's a lot of stairs its a lot of walking and they're allowed to touch you"" my girlfriend was freaked out about that and she left us no choice but to buy the haunted harbor tickets which we didn't want but she had out. We didn't have fun waiting an hour and a half to walk in a 5 minute maze and not once be scared by any of the people in costume... But the corn dog was good... Oh well- bought some tickets to the ship walk/ lets see how that goes-",donovan d
20,Not great,Ask for your AAA discount when you get your tickets. I was so glad to get the $10 discount because it really isn't worth what they are charging. It's very confusing how to get around and it's basically empty with a few rooms set up the way they were. We did not do the audio tour and maybe that would have helped. Save your money and just take a picture of the exterior because there isn't much to take a picture of on board. Huge disaapointment.,srjpJohnsonCity
50,Super day out,"We bought tickets online and found a promotion code for 20% off which made 2 first class tickets $49 in total.We did the ghost tour which was very good and also had a historical tour with the ticket but the only time they could fit us on that tour was 4.30pm so we didn't bother with that.You get an audio guide which takes you around the ship, really good.Several bars and cafes for food and drink. Recommend the Tearooms which is near the Princess Diana exhibition, service was amazing and the setting so luxurious.Great day out. Parking is $15.",Morley2105
40,Amazing piece of history,"Took my family to the hotel for the night. Part of the room is a free walking tour. My daughters, 8 and 11, found each aspect of the tour very interesting. My husband, who is interested in all things related to military history, was also intrigued. It was so cool to see the original place settings, furnishings and art from the ship. It was neat to learn how the ship was used in several different ways and see the amazing infrastructure in place that in many ways is not so different that what you would find in a more modern vessel. We spent a solid 90 minutes exploring the ship. Great exercise too.",Queenofc
40,One of the great liners - free 30 minute stop,This great old ship is a joy to see. We didn't have time to go inside but just seeing it from the parking lot was amazing. Our tour bus driver pointed out that there is free 30 minute parking in the lot adjacent to the ship and so she pulled in to let everyone off for a picture stop. If you are touring the area by car and have limited time this is a good way to get up close to this ship. Hopefully next time I will be able to tour it.,trainfan2000
40,Enjoyable and fun,"Visited the Queen Mary whilst at Long Beach. Although it was a little expensive, it was still an enjoyable experience. We bought a combined ticket to go and explore the Russian submarine too. Lots to do on the Queen Mary. We were given a guided tour by a very knowledgeable tour guide, who also happened to have great sense of humour. Also visited the Princess Diana and Bob Hope exhibitions, these were vey interesting. The we went on the submarine which was an awesome experience, but it is very small, much smaller than you would expect. But enjoyable all the same. Lovely little boat ride across from Long Beach too.",dougall45
30,"Overpriced, but still fun.","We visited here for a good Halloween experience after already booking Universal's annual event. The tickets and fast past were over priced for the 6 mazes and even though the scaring was fantastic, it was ridiculous to have to pay more for extras inside the attraction. All inclusive should be the key! Seems to be more concerned about profit, but we can't deny the fun.",DAJT
10,"The Queen Mary, a big disappointment...","Today we went out to the Queen Mary, we thought we would be seeing a grand old dame of the sea, take a trip back in time to get a glimpse of how the rich lived in a more opulent era. It was a big disappointment. We were late for the tour and there was an hour wait until the next tour. So we decided to take ourselves for a look around. For $17 each we went aboard. Apart from the entrance, there is not a lot of her grandeur left to see. The rooms are all closed off, there were no hands on deck, there were no clear signs to explain where you were, shops selling cartoon products. I think whom ever is in charge of running the tourism operation on this piece of history needs to rethink their approach. The decks set up with deck chairs, staff in the shops in period costumes, staterooms opened up to be seen and perhaps an area that displayed how it was when used as a troop ship in WW2. If any of that was there, then that just proves how there are no clear signs posted. When we arrived at the entrance of the boat, we were sent back 300 metres to purchase our tickets that could have been sold from the entrance. The ticket salesman had no recommendations on what tour to even take.The best thing about the trip out was the bus driver who stopped and waited a few minutes for us to get to the bus as we were with our elderly mum. More than happy to pay to go on and have a look, we imagine the upkeep would be rather costly, and the shuttle bus out there was free. But it just didn't live up to expectations.",Mel F
30,skip the ghost tour - really,"That defines cheese. (The final effect has some promise, but it terribly underplayed for what it could have been.) Not cheap when combined with the Iowa - make sure they give you a ticket or you will drive from one to the other and then face confusion. Your audio companion is rather charming, though you don't really get a sense of what life would have been like aboard her in the 30's-50's. Partly due to its still being a going hotel, so make allowances. You might do better on one of the docent lead tours / I did only the audio. Quite a bit of walking as one goes from one end of the ship to the other - mind your time if you plan something afterwards. I would have tried one of the ship's cafes but needed to make the Iowa! Billed as the most luxurious ship afloat in its day, you don't quite get a sense of that / it isn't (an one suspects wasn't) the Titantic or any of its sister ships. Faster yes, not fitted as well. It is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon - so maybe a 3.5 but for price and that silly preamble performance (some in the group loved it, however).",scott r
30,Princess Diana Exhibit on the Queen Mary,"I am a die hard Princess Diana fan. I did not feel this exhibit was worth the $33 price tag. Most of the exhibit is newspaper articles, collectors items, and commorative memorabilia. Many items in the exhibit are replicas. You had to read carefully to determine which things actually belonged to the royal family and which things were There were many hand written notes by Diana and the dresses they haare well maintained. It is a good history lesson on the royal family and it is a good collection of news clippings and videos. Just thought it was a bit pricey.",makTexas
30,Visiting after a cruise,"The three stars is because of a problem and poor customer service when we arrived. 6 of us walked over from a cruise ship and asked if we could check our luggage (we had called ahead of time and were told we could) so that we could tour the attraction while we waited for a shuttle a few hours later. After giving our luggage to the bellhop, we then walked across the parking lot to buy tickets - about $250.00 for all of us. We really enjoyed the attraction itself and found that the 3 hours we had allotted was not enough time as we were rushing at the end. While we were waiting for our shuttle to arrive, we noticed other people coming from the cruise ship and being told they could tour the Queen Mary FOR FREE. We asked the new bellhop on duty and this was confirmed. We asked why we had not been told that and asked for our money back. We had to go across the parking lot again and wait for a manager who finally did refund our money.",bcs819
50,Well worth a visit,"Walking onto the Queen Mary is definitely taking a step back into time. We did not stay in the accommodations but if I return, I plan on getting the full experience. We did not arrive in time for the guided tour (which I would do next time), so we did a self-guided tour. I couldn't get enough of all the amazing historic features.We did, however, dine in the fine dining restaurant, Sir Winstons. It was a true treat, from beginning to end. Food was excellent but the service was stellar...white glove...just perfect.",Terry J
50,I love the Queen Mary with all my heart!,"My fiancé and I have just come home from our 3rd trip here this year, and as usual The Queen Mary does not disappoint. We have always been so happy with our stays here.Our room during this last visit was A147, and it was lovely. Clean, great view of Long Beach, and just all around wonderful.We always spend a majority of our time walking around the ship, we could never tire of wandering around The Queen Mary! She is magnificent ship. You can feel her history while you explore her decks.I have on more than one occasion seen negative reviews on Yelp and other sites, saying the ship is not what people hoped it would be, or complaints about the rooms being ""outdated"", and several other unpleasant things being said about this beautiful ship, and I'd like to remind you folks who say these things, the Queen Mary is an old ship, if you want completely modern, go elsewhere. If you want to stay here, you should respect the fact this ship has been through many, many years, and she may be a little tired, but she is still incredible. Not every aspect of the Queen Mary is what modern people view as luxury, yet, in my eyes it is more luxurious than any other hotel I have ever stayed at. I would always chose this ship over the most modern hotel. The old feel is what makes The Queen Mary a magical place.Anyway, the Queen Mary has my heart, she is absolutely gorgeous, and I can not wait for my next visit! Thank you to the whole crew aboard the ship for always making us feel welcome, and for caring for this ship so well!Oh and I almost forgot, the Haunted Encounters tour, lead by tour guide, Paul, was absolutely wonderful! Paul was really nice, and informative!",ifsogirl26
50,A great place to visit if you like history.,"Well worth visiting just for the day, lots of organised tours which are very interesting. Great views of Long Beach.",Anna22091956
50,Heaven for a history buff!,"I did two seperate tours of this beautiful ship while staying at Hotel Maya just down the street. If you are a person who loves ships and nautical history, this has to be on your bucket list! Fantastic guide for one tour, self paced tour for the other.",James C
40,A Glimpse Back in Time,"This is so much better than you might imagine. Wandering around the wooden decks, taking the self guided tour and exploring the ship from top to bottom was really interesting. And perfect for people who want the freedom to wander and explore on their own. Seeing the well restored captains quarters, the bridge, and engine were all fascinating. You are free to touch whatever is within arms reach and feel close to the history of this remarkable ship.Lunch in the Tea Room was surprising good - simple sandwiches on fresh bread were excellent.I did not stay here and walking down the hallways, the carpet was worn and it did not appear as clean and well maintained as one might hope for.I saw and overheard the guided tours, which look like they would take a lot longer, a lot more information and a little less freedom.The Princess Diana exhibit could have been retitled A Brief History of Royalty in the News. Since this was as much about Diana as the royal family tree. Much information was conveyed via newspaper covers, photos and memorabilia leading up to viewing the royal dresses (and an even larger collection of doll- wearing-replicas). It was actually a great exhibit, really interesting and it would be easy to spend 2 hours in this single exhibit. NOTE: the room is very cold to preserve the fabrics - everyone was shivering - so bring a warm sweater!",Terri S
40,Go with the guided tour,"A friend and I visited this historic ship and decided to just do the ""self-guided"" tour...big mistake! We ended up wandering around trying to figure out how to get out of the place! It's a beautiful ship but doesn't mean much without someone to give you some background information.",Karla S
50,Historic boat,Wonderful experience. I went on ghost and legends tour. Guide took us all around. I cant believe that inside the boat has such a huge swimming pool. It was awesome!!,AchiL18
30,Pay extra for the guided tour,Interesting ship with lots of history. A little pricey for what you get. Spring for the guided tour to at least get more information than you can by going it alone.,gwen450
40,Historic Hotel,"Stayed here for four nights, rooms were spacious with lots of historical artefacts and fixtures. Did the tour of the ship which was included in the stay and was very informative. Staff were so helpful. Definitely worth a visit. Handy free bus to downtown Long Beach ran all day.",Johnnyfee
50,An afternoon trip,"We visited the queen Mary during our stay at long beach, we visited the princess Diana experience while on the ship and I thoroughly enjoyed this. We explored the ship and then went to the tea rooms and had afternoon tea which was good value for money and was delicious. The waiters in the tea room were excellent and very attentive. This attraction did seem slightly steep in price but we were very glad that we had the chance to do this",Dianamichelle1
50,A Step Back in Time,"Staying on the Queen Mary takes you right back to the days of the elegant ocean liners. The accommodation is not luxurious by today's standards but is very comfortable and authentic. Very little has been changed. The restaurant is excellent - very good food and service. The service at breakfast was poor, very slow, and the food was cold when it arrived. This is a romantic hotel most suitable for couples and would be lovely for a wedding.",Suzanne B
50,AWESOME,The Sunday brunch is spectacular but really for adults for the price. I honestly could not think of one thing that I wanted that was not available. The ship itself and the tour is amazing. You truly get a feel of what it was like living back when she was steaming across the Atlantic. Wonderful experience.,sasnks
20,"Queen Mary, Long Beach, Ca","So disappointed! The Queen has been left unpainted and ravished by the sun over the years she's been here. We got our tickets after waiting an age at the kiosk, ticket prices 27 $ each and extra tickets needed to go into any of the 'attractions' which is this case was Princess Diana's dresses. Then when we finally got to the level whereby you pick up your audio guide you had to produce photo I'd before they would let you have one!! how utterly ridiculous is that!! You can't in without a ticket then they won't give you the audio!!! The ship is majorly in need of a massive spruce up and paint job they are not even doing justice to her original condition. The loos are also not good. There's also a ""Royal Wedding Chapel"" on board! There was an exhibition about Bob Hope ""American treasure"" ( he's British by the way!) which was ok but not fascinating. All in all I would not recommend this, far better to stay home and visit Brittainia in Leith, Edinburgh - now THAT is worth a visit!",J H
50,Majestic old Queen,"Wonderful experience. Lunch was fantastic and the size of the ship stunned me. The staff etc, were great and polite.... fantastic experience.",Philip L
50,Must see family friendly historic day trip,"Make plans to see this attraction which includes the Russian Scorpion sub you can tour before heading into the Queen Mary. The food, gift shops, ghost tours, listening tours and photo ops are worth the time and ticket fee. Enjoy !",palenakamikale
30,Nice boat but the self guided tour isn't great,We liked the boat and it's history.Didn't like the self guided tour as it was hard to hear in parts of ths ship and asked you to go to point 17 without telling you where point 17 was located.,Steve K
30,24 hours in the past,"As expected the boat was BIG and Beautiful, But run as a hotel. The signage was poor which made it difficult to find our way around. Elevators are very small and as there are no service sized elevators Red Caps used the same facilities which meant crowded elevators or long waits. Signage in the elevators was especially poor. Had a great dinner and drinks at the Chowder House with excellent staff but was disappointed with the breakfast buffet even though it was large the food was sub standard. Our family room was spacious and interesting full of antiques including port holes that opened but we nearly froze in the night since there are no comfort controls in the room.",Kim B
30,Queen Mary visit,"We did the haunted package which is a bit expensive but truly enjoyed the tours inside & out the huge ship. Our guide was very nice, giving us a balance of scary & helpful advise throughout.Do try to wear comfortable shoes coz there are some element of surprise fast to short runnings in between.",eTaka
40,Our first visit made us want to return and stay on board overnight,"We wanted to visit a part of history while in the area. The ship is beautiful....especially considering when it was built and service she provided during the war. We did the ghost tours while on board and preferred the one that provided more history and stories vs the one that was supposed to scare you (which was more like visiting a haunted house at an amusement park). We enjoyed a nice lunch in the restaurant and am pleased to say exceeded our expectations. We often expect, when going to an attraction, the food services are average or below. ...but the four of us all said it was better than we expected, reasonably prices and plenty to choose from.",David C
40,Still get great feeling of being on a historic ship,"Queen Mary is huge and impressive. Many rooms are open and cafe's even working. Could have better written descriptions around. Run as a hotel and my daughter liked staying there. In good shape and well worth seeing. Located in Long Beach it is near city, restaurants and a beautiful seaside shopping area.",richard s
10,Dont waste your hard earned money,"Visited this museum paid around sixty bucks for tickets and fifteen for the parking. What we got to see was just ship and the engine room. There are much better places to see a galley or a cruise(in historical perspective) out there in California. If you need to see other exhibits then pay more. Most of the areas were inaccessible or converted to restaurants. In our 11 day of California trip, visiting this ship was the only wrong decision we made.",montymishra
50,Queen Mary,"Interesting and a good history lesson. Ship is small compared to modern cruise liners. Ghost stories and exhibit could frighten small children. Fast food OK for the visit, did not try the main restaurant. Wedding ballroom and catering was superior. Some shopping in a small mall aboard the boat. Engine room especially interesting. Long Beach skyline is a bonus where we ate on deck.",JimHoover

We were there many years ago and all I remember getting to see was some of the troop rooms from war days and the engine room. The hotel area was off limits.

50,She's STILL the Queen!,"When visiting Long Beach, everyone should always take time to visit the Queen Mary. It is a ship from the past, there really is nothing else like it in the world. My parents actually sailed to Europe on the Queen Mary before she was brought to live in Long Beach. I have had many good times over the years...I had my high school prom there, not to mention numerous Christmas parties for work, as well as pleasure visits to explore this one of a kind ship/museum. The tours are great, and there is a little village right next to the Queen Mary with other cool things to explore ... a Russian Sub lives here, too! Great fun for ALL. The hotel is fun to stay at, too.",Yesship

Good cusine and variety.",Melanie K
30,Very poor staff experience,"I've been to the Queen Mary many times because I love the ship. However my friends and I recently went to a rock concert there that was very poorly managed, and I've had similar experiences in the past. The staff was not trained properly and the signage for the event was virtually non-existent. This led to a lot of unnecessary aggravation--for example, we stood in line for a long time for our will-call ticket, only to find out it was the wrong line and we needed to be in a different (also long) line. A simple sign would have straightened that out. When we got our tickets, we were told to get wristbands for the event. However, when we went to the line to get those, the person was called away and told us airily to ""go up and get"" the wristbands outside the event. Well, we did not know exactly where the event was on this large ship. And neither did the many other people suddenly fumbling around, not knowing where to go. Again, signage would have helped. We wandered around the ship until we finally stumbled onto where we needed to be and again lined up. Only by accident, almost, because of poor information. We finally got into the event, only to discover it was much smaller than we expected. We were told numerous bands were playing. Well, only one band AT A TIME was playing, with a long delay in between. You could not get any food because if you left the area, you had to walk all the way back around the ship to get back in. Even though we had wristbands. All in all, it was pretty annoying and I wouldn't return. A shame, really, because I love this ship and in the past I've been one of its biggest fans.",Marla F
40,A majestic ship,"I was disappointed with this liner. We had to wait until 4pm for our room to be ready, some members of our party had to wait longer. Although the room was a lovely old cabin sumptuously decorated it lacked basics like tea or coffee making facilities, a fridge, a safe and only providing onekey. They also charged for WiFi access $9.95, the only hotel on our holiday to do so.",1xmaturecouple
50,Awesome Restaurant,"I stayed on the Queen Mary for 3 nights. It is now a Hilton Hotel. The cabins are small as you would expect on a former cruise ship but very luxurious. There is real wood all over the cabin, not seen on the cruise ships they are building today. They have a number of restaurants on the ship and I ate at the same one twice. I can't recall the name of it but they cook your meal on a cart right beside your table. I had steak cooked in a garlic butter that was to die for. Of course you pay for all this pampering but when you are on vacation you expect to spend money.",Gail H
30,Not for kids,"I took my eight-year-old and he was quite bored, however, there were a lot of people in period costume going on guided tours and I'm sure it was wonderful for them. For the rest of us ordinary folk, it's quite overpriced - $27 for an adult just to walk onto the ship and not see any of the exhibits.",Leslie S
30,"Faded, neglected grandure.","Went see this famous Clyde built ship and was very saddened.It is in serious need of a paint job and the outside of the ship looks neglected.Only one restaurant open for lunch and the food and service were acceptable but nothing more.I was only able to tour the upper decks which was effectively free as the admissions cost is deducted from the food bill.The ship look neglected and the positioning of tacky stalls, red telephone boxes and ludicrous wedding chapel have cheapened and degraded this once proud ship.The bridge looks great and the fog horn at noon a surprise, especially if you under it.For the prices charged it is rather a disappointment and the locating of the Russian submarine next to it is madness.$17 to park reduced to $ 7 if you have a meal. $15 to get on board to upper decks only and refundable against a meal.Glad I went but unlikely to ever return. It needs a refit to make it as glamorous as it was was.",Binman62
10,Very Disappointing,We arrived at 4:30 pm and purchased tickets for the self-guided audio tour of the ship. When we arrived at the audio station we were informed it was too late to do the audio tour but could wander around the ship on our own. Without the audio it was not worth the money. We saw a nice Bob Hope exhibit aboard the ship but could make no connection between Bob Hope and the Queen Mary. Perhaps the audio would have explained it better.,pmnoyes
30,Definitely Worth Checking Out,"I was a little worried about visiting the Queen Mary before my trip because of the reviews I read. Some were good some not so good. But the disturbing part is how passive aggressive the ""Commodore"" tends to be towards most negativity. No review should be called ""odd"".These are your customers and just reading how you respond to them makes me laugh. I'm sure I'll get some backlash for saying that as well. Anyways, I bought the Aquarium Combo ticket that came with the self guided tour and a Ghosts and Legends tour. The self guided tour was pretty nice, informative, I would have liked a few more facts but it was still enjoyable. I'm not sure how people got lost because it literally gives you directions. I wasn't pleased that my device was warning me that it's battery was low, it made me concerned about how long it was going to live. (Luckily, it didn't die). The Ghosts and Legends tour didn't disappoint me because I knew ahead of time that it wasn't going to be amazing. Our guides were quite lovely though so it wasn't a complete waste.",MissRAD
50,Historical Ambience,"If you love Princess Di and the British empire, this is a must visit. And it was an experience to view the submarine. next time i would love to stay at the hotel too.",Nazia Q
40,An honor to come aboard,"The ship was very interesting and a ton of history. Sure there are some dark and possibly difficult area to navigate in the engine room but hands down the coolest old ship. I have been on 15 cruises and love ships but don't expect it to be a modern day cruise ship. The restaurant food is decent but pricey. The Princess Dianna exhibit was worth seeing and a lot to see. Okay, the exterior of the ship could use a new paint job to make this famous ship look great again but I'm sure it's not cheap keeping this exhibits budget above water.",Magnum9797
50,Champagne Brunch,A fantastic brunch experience with attentive staff and loads of food options.The ambiance in the large art-deco style dining room is superb and the whole family enjoyed the experience. Be sure to explore the ship afterwards and visit to bar at the back of the ship for a cocktail or two.We will definitely return.,NockyR
40,Birthday,"Loved it, quiet , Bar Drinks were great, people friendly, food good, tours good, over all decor of the ship thums up so much fabulous history. Just a great get away for husbands birthday.",Cora A
40,Never leave shore great fun,Step back in time for a drink and ocean views... a great way to break up the week. The Churchill is a great dining place...,bobcrisp
40,Quite a lot to do,"I am a history buff so visiting this ocean liner was something I wanted to do anyway but I was surprised by how much there was to do here. Though you can drive around to Long Beach if you want to find more restaurants and such, there is one on board, plus a café. There is a bar in the prow (we jokingly called it 10 Forward because of the décor). There are tours, including a rather silly ghost tour that was fun anyway, and a museum. Not least, the room we had was original so the decorative elements were marvelous. With the Cobra Submarine next to it, we didn't end up leaving for the city though we spent the better part of two days there.The only warnings I have are that the inboard rooms are newer so don't have the same charm as the rooms nearer the hull and that the walls are PAPER thin. We could hear every breath and zipper in the room next door. After a sleepless few hours of trying to ignore the neighbors, my roommate asked them to please let us get some sleep in a totally normal, unraised tone of voice. The room next door went silent. It's like they're in the same room as you. Also the beds are quite small so tall men, be warned.Other than that, it was a really fun bit of history with far more to see than I'd expected for what is really a hotel.",EmmaSeattle
40,Queen Mary Visit,We took a self guided tour of the ship. It was all that we expected and then some. We stopped in the main lounge and enjoyed a libation. there are several gift shops that have many ships mementos for sale. One can also book a room on this glorius ship to enjoy it's many venues. There is also a wedding chapel if one needs to get married.,Chester D
50,Interesting tours!,"A trip back into the past glory of trans-Atlantic travel! The elegance of the ship has been well maintained and restored. There are many different types of tours to really get a feel of what it must have been like to travel on board. Also, special exhibits about Princess Diana and Bob Hope made the visit very worthwhile.",CarolNJID
10,Not worth it.,"Until Long Beach spends some money on fixing things like rugs (lumpy), the rails (not attached to the wall in places) and hiring more staff, they will lose the ship just because no one cares.",Carol S
50,Grand old lady with art deco flair,"We stayed 2 nights on the Queen Mary and while there took the various tours on offer - wonderful to hear about the history of the ship, and enjoyed the Princess Diana exhibition also. A well presented exhibition. You are able to wander around the whole ship exploring the various decks etcReally enjoyed the original art deco fixtures and fittings.The Observation Bar is well worth a visit to enjoy the ambience, music, and their happy hours which are 4-7pm.Highly recommended as a visit not to be missed if you are in Long Beach.",Noelene B
30,A Bit of History,"I took my 11 yr. old nephew with me to the Queen Mary. We bought the ""Historic First Class Passport"" which got us entrance to the Queen Mary, The Foxtrot Submarine, and the Ghost & Legends show.The Pros:-Having the opportunity to go into a real sub-The audio tour of the Queen Mary; go at your own pace, easy to use & fact filled-Being able to wander around the ship on our own-An informative ""Historical Glory Days Tour""The Cons:-The ""Historical Glory Days Tour"" is very informative but not for children under 14, it is too long and not age appropriate.-The ghost show was terrible. I have been in elementary school haunted houses that were better than this. I learned more about the ""ghosts"" by reading signs on the walls than I did from the tour.-There are no water fountains so bring your own water or be prepared to buy some.-You will not see the inside of a stateroom unless you stay at the hotel.I would definitely recommend going since it is an iconic part of our history, but I wouldn't take little kids.",kickdiva1
50,Reliving Historical Posh Times,"I am a local who would recommend this as the first thing to do in Long Beach. Just walking aboard the ship feels like magic. I love walking in the footsteps of the famous people who were there before me. The artwork on the walls tells the whole story. A fine evening would be to stay in the Hotel and have cocktails in the Art Deco lounge and then head on up to Sir. Winston's for one of the finest meals you will ever have as long as you order the Beef Wellington and Lobster Salad. Ask for a window table, make a reservation and dress well as Sir Winston did. The Ship is old time fabulous...go visit the Queen!",PeggyChism
40,Exploring the Queen Mary,"We have visited the Queen Mary on numerous occasions. First, we enjoy dining on the Queen Mary and also having drinks at the bars. We like the views from some of the restaurants.We also like exploring the boat; learning more about the history of he Queen Mary, and browsing through the shops.We have enjoyed going to New Years Eve parties on the Queen Mary. There is lively dancing and the fireworks at midnight are a nice touch to celebrate the New Year.We have also stayed on the Queen Mary for several nights. We liked the feel of staying on the boat, but the smaller bathroom size and rooms, has met we now stay else where in Long Beach. It was still fun to do it at least once and be able to explore the Queen Mary when the day visitors had departed. It was also fun to watch from the Queen Mary the loading and unloading of a passenger ship that departs from about the same area.Parking is at a fee lot by the Queen Mary.",mini
50,Days gone by!,"Lucky enough to spend my 40th Birthday in the Restaurant of the Queen Mary Long Beach. It was quite odd to be walking on the decks and seeing the pictures of the rich and famous who had walked the very same decks. There are good tours here but we chose to have dinner in the restaurant. This was a treat and an experience I shall never have again. The service was fist class, a little too formal for my tastes, however it was the way of the restaurant, The food was exquisite - as was the wine. This was good value for money considering the venue and menu content.I went in 2003 so cant say what it would be like now but I would say it will still have consistent good service.........",Caroline S
30,A nice attraction but a long walk,"It's a trip back in time to see how the first cruise liners were built and furnished. However could not get to see any of the cabins or state rooms. A lot of walking and plenty of stairs to go up and down. A nice way to spend a couple of hours, but it's not got everyone.",22tangotwo
50,Fun afternoon,Loved the tour of the Queen Mary Ship. We had a fabulous tour guide. He was full of interesting information. It was a pretty amazing ship and tour. Would definitely take another tour there. They offer two other haunted tours.,Nedlbbi
10,Ghost Tour....,"I paid for 2 ghost tours for the 8pm August 6th tour. I was rather disappointed with the tour. I was hoping for more stories/history and we got long dowsing (sp?) rod sessions. Too long. There were quite a few members of our group that were so bored they would wander off or go sit elsewhere due to the length of these sessions. If I would've known we would only be getting 30 minutes of history out of a 2 hour tour I definitely would not have taken the tour. Also, our guide, although a very nice young man, needs to attend to his personal hygiene as his body odor was particularly pungent. I would like to get my money back if possible or at least half. It was awful. I loved the ship and it's beauty, but the ghost tour needs help....After reading the horrible reviews of the ghost tours, sounds like The Queen Mary has a ""oops sorry your tour sucked, but we hope to see you in the future"" answer to all the negative reviews....I probably can kiss all my money goodbye.I have also sent 2 e-mails to the attractions department of the Queen Mary and have not heard anything back from them.Awesome customer service . NOT!",Whooptink
50,what an amazing experience sailing in the past,"I really loved the visit to the Queen Mary. There was a party arranged on it and we had the chance to visit the whole ship during the "" hunted tour"" . It was fascinating and pretty scary!!!. Our guide was really good. good",Anna p
50,Last of the Line,"Yes, it's old, and yes, it could perhaps have been better in places, but the fact is that if you want to see how the 'upper class' travelled before World War 2 then this is the only place to see it. Modern cruise ships are full of fake wood and shiny plastic - this lovely ship is full of the real thing, and styled in the most fantastic art deco. The engine room is a monument to past technologies, and the bars a monument to a time when style really mattered. If you're in the area, it's a must see.",vsu419
50,Fantastic piece of preserved history,"Spent half a day on the ship starting off with the ghost tour, hosted by Bill who had an excellent dry sense of humour and view on paranormal activity. We then went on to do the self guided audio tour which I found to be very informative. The ship still captures it's past really well and hasn't completely succumbed to just being turned into a money making venture that has no sparkle. Would recommend highly if in the area and represents great value for money if combined with another local attraction.",Taffydog06
20,Mixed review,"I have stayed here w/family & hotel experience was fun. However, just took a friend & we purchased the ""Best Value"" tour package. The WWII war ship tour was very interesting and worth while. BUT, the Ghost tour was a farce and I feel possibly dangerous at times having you walk through very dark halls, etc. I feel some of the areas (pool/engine room) would be fun to see in brighter light & should be a part of a regular tour. My largest complaint was PARKING! By the time we did the tour & a little shopping (restaurant is only place validating) we ran about 1/2 hr over the parking limit and had to pay an outrageously high fee to exist. I felt totally taken advantage of! No wonder they have not succeeded as an attraction for locals. I can understand high parking if you are there more than a couple of days to discourage cruise people parking, but not when you've been there an afternoon!",Mary S
40,Well worth a visit,We spent a lovely afternoon visiting this ship and had a wonderful experience just walking round. After taking a cruise on a modern cruise liner its intersting to see how things were years ago. If you have the chance don't miss the ghost tour.,Dave W
40,Stay home and Take a Cruise,"Take a cruise on the Queen Mary in Long Beach California while it is tied up at the dock. You sleep in one of the original state rooms just as the wealthy passengers did 70 years ago. There are fine restaurants on board, many interesting shops, and a wealth of tours available led by expert guides.It is almost like being on a short cruise. We stayed one night and two full days. We were kept busy the whole time and didn't even take half of the available tours. Tea in the beautiful tearoom is fun. The restaurants are priced from moderate to very expensive, depending on your taste.There is ample parking for guests. You can explore the gigantic ship alone if you do not want to pay for tours. Most tours are half price for guests taking a room for at least one night.The experience is suitable for couples or families with children. There is lots to see and do for children as well as adults. Ghost tours of the ship at night are fun. Lots of history about World War II as well.",bokertov1
20,Take charge of your own enjoyment of this ship,"The Queen Mary has a really interesting past that makes the stop worth your while...take into account the stepping back in time, to soak in the history may assist the poorly managed attraction. Our family came from various parts of the U.S. to celebrate the wedding of two very special people. The ship management truly frustrated the wedding couple, as little help to accommodate all their planning for the big day. Very difficult to transport the wedding decor, with no carts or help from the crew. Wedding suite was not included in the package for the couple as stated - adding a large expense to their day. Fire evacuation - not once, but twice, the ships fire alarms were engaged, evacuation of ship followed, one of the two occurred at 1:30 a.m. Lovely way to rest peacefully following the busy wedding day. If you search YouTube, you'll find the fire alarm goes off frequently. One would think management could do something to prevent such pranks from occurring so often. Accommodations were a minimum, not so comfy beds, along with LOUD noise from rolling carts from the crew all night long, as well as loud neighbors with little sound barrie between rooms.The wedding couple had a beautiful wedding due to the couples planning, . I recommend not using the location for your Big Day - look around for a place that will relieve the stress, not add to it. Save the QM for a short day visit only.",IowaGuiness
30,So so,"Ok spot to visit to say you were there, but nothing great. We were there for an event that included hundreds of people. Therefore, the food was buffet style, nothing great. Hot food wasn't hot enough. Again, take the tour of this historic ship to say you did it, but nothing too earth shattering.",karrhr
50,The elegant old lady of the Atlantic,"So nice to immerse yourself in the history of the gracious old lady! Well worth a visit and enjoyed by young and old alike. Walking the promenade deck and imagining the soldiers off to war, crammed in like sardines. amazing floating history.",andybags
40,Experience the fantastic voyage of a Queen,Yes you feel like going back in time to enjoy the luxury and splendor of those days gone by. this was the era of the rich and wealthy.,hsplain
40,Fun Morning Trip,"You can't believe the history of this ship. If you want to know how different things were not so long ago, pay close attention to the detail of the decor and size of rooms/halls. Nice view from the top deck and if you are lucky, Carnival will have the Imagination or Inspiration in port. These are both older Carnival ships, but not much bigger than the Queen Mary. Nice way to spend the morning in Long Beach. Cost of admission for standard Passport Tour is $29. Parking is extra and so is food/beverage purchased aboard. I wish we would have stayed the night aboard and enjoyed a room there. Next time. Cheers.",Spectre13
50,Once in a lifetime...you must see Queen Mary,"I'd heard about the Queen Mary ever since I was a child. I never get down to Long Beach, and hadn't thought about planning a trip just to see it. But, while in Long Beach for Ed Parker Jr.'s Martial Arts Hall of Fame Master's Ceremony, I HAD TO see the Queen Mary. I'm so glad I did. The cheapest way to go, without taking a tour, is to buy a $15 dining voucher, which gets you on the ship. Then, the $15 is applied to your food bill. We ate at the Observation Bar. I had a Singapore Sling, some Cajun Spiced Edamame, and Vegetarian Egg Rolls. EXCELLENT! Then, went on a self-tour of the ship. If I were to ever go back, I think I'd go on the haunted tour.",dbrgdmn
50,This is the spot to visit,"This is the spot to visit, take a tour and eat or drink on board. the ship is haunted and a friend saw a ghost when she worked there",BuenoOrNot
40,Lots of history aboard,"We really enjoyed our time aboard the Queen Mary. The ship carries with it a boat load of history and you could easily spend a day looking around. The decor throughout takes you back to an age gone by. There is also the opportunity to grab some excellent photos of the Long Beach area from the top deck. In addition, be sure to include a trip to the engine room - simply amazing.We did take the Ghosts and Gouls tour which lasted about 40 minutes. The guy that hosted it did an excellent job however it wasn't all that scary - that being said, my partner begged to differ!",KiwiTraveller85
50,Ghost Cat!,"Since I'm a resident of Long Beach, I've been visiting the old Queen since I was a kid, but this was the first time I've taken the paranormal tour. This was the Paranormal Shipwalk Tour that is available at 8:00 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. My husband and I have gone on all kinds of ghost tours all around the country; to be honest, we've never seen anything paranormal, so I had pretty low expectations here. We really wanted to see places on the Queen Mary that visitors typically don't get to see, and we certainly did that. We got to the belly of the ship, including the bow, where it was close to being claustrophobic. As we were heading there, another lady and I both heard a cat's meow. I jokingly said, ""Ghost cat!"" Our guide asked if I'd heard a cat and then proceeded to talk about the ghost cat that had been sighted and heard over the years right where we were. Talk about creepy! Going to the boiler room and through door 13 where a young fireman was crushed to death by the closing door, were interestingly creepy as well. We also went into the pool room where wet footprints have been known to appear, even though there is no water in the pool (didn't happen with us), and we also went to an area where a stateroom supposedly had so much paranormal activity, Queen Mary officials no longer allow people to stay there. No ghostly activity for us. Except for ghost cat, there wasn't any other other-world activity that we saw. But I wasn't disappointed, because I got to see so many places on the ship that I had never seen before, and I got to hear cool ghost stories by our tour guide, whose name I can't remember, unfortunately. I think this is worthwhile, especially if you can find a discount with Groupon or Living Social. Say ""hi"" to ghost cat for me!",patty49er
40,Lots of history on this liner!,"We stayed on board the Queen Mary before our cruise after spending a week in Anaheim. The shuttle ride down was very good & we arrived fresh, ready for a day of exploring. The front desk staff were great & we found our room with no trouble at all. Very art deco, which was beautiful. We knew full well that this wasn't going to be a modern room, but it had everything we needed. Didn't eat at the main restaurant (too expensive) just had dinner & breakfast at the cafe. Both suited our needs well. Visited the gift shop for some souvenirs & went on a ghost tour of the ship. We found it to be very interesting & we did see some parts of the ship that you cannot otherwise access. Others have said that it was corny & unorganised but, maybe because we were hotel guests, we thought it was great. The tour itself was small but our guide was terrific & we had all of our questions answered. The indoor pool was fantastic also. This is a great place to stay before going on a cruise from Long Beach & would do it all again in a headbeat! Oh the art deco bar was a treat & loved having cocktails there.",MW1958
50,Wonderful,"Affordable (we did the Passport for 25.00 which lets you see everything on the ship (and the submarine) except the Princess Diana exhibit; right down to the propeller still in water. The floors that have the hotel on it are beautifully done in wood and everything is very nice and upgraded. We did the self guided tour so we could take as long as we wanted, and we had a great time.",Donna H
50,Honeymoon on the Queen,"granted this goes back a few years but we wanted to do something different so we honeymooned on the Queen Mary. We drove in from out of state and arrived at about 1:30am. The area had some light fog and it was eerily quiet so this definately added to the ambiance. When we checked in to our stateroom, we turned the tv on and a local LA station was playing silent Charlie Chaplan movies. The ""ghost tour"" was ok but the big attactrion was relaxing on and walking around the grand ship and feeling the nastalgia of an era gone by. the ship was big for its day but not anything like the monster cruise ships that currently sail. Enjoy the visit and relax in yesterday.",John W
30,Corny Tours with Wannabe Actors,"We had about a 10 minute wait to get our tickets. Only three windows were open and the people manning them were very slow. The first tour was given by a man who spoke in a monotone in order to set a scary mood for the Ghost Tour.. It was a half hour tour through dark passages, fog, and things hanging from the ceiling, that were supposed to be spiders. The tour was about 25 minutes too long. We broke for a pricy lunch and then took what was called ""The Glory Tour."" This was an hour walking tour with another very dramatic guide. We did visit a ballroom, and a suite, among other things. The history of the ship was very interesting.This visit is not handicapped accessible. There are many areas that cannot be reached without walking many stairs. the Engine Room, in particular, is one of these places. We were told there were 15 steps, but there were actually 37. We did find most of the staff to be cordial and friendly.",BigApple1
40,Interesting ship but poorly run,"I enjoyed my visit to the Queen Mary. There is just so much history and it is interesting to walk through such an old ship. I purchased the package that included the submarine tour, the self-guided headphone tour, a guided tour, and a choice of either the ghost tour or the glory days World War II tour (I chose the ghost tour).It was very disorganized and difficult to figure out where to go to even start the tour and obtain the headphones. The $15 parking fee was also ridiculously high. I arrived about one in the afternoon and I think I should have been told that it was a little late to do all of those tours and give them sufficient time before 6 o'clock closing.Having said all that, the ship is magnificent and truly fun and interesting to visit. I had to rush through the headphone tour in order to make my guided tour, meaning I cut off parts of the renovation and quickly move through the ship. It was an interesting narration, done by an officer who served aboard the ship during its heyday.tOn the other hand, the guided tour was quite a disappointment. My guide was a flamboyant mix of a circus ringmaster and an evangelical tent preacher. I believe he was more interested in hearing himself talk and go through his shenanigans than actually tell us interesting things about the ship. He told us nothing that I did not hear on the headphone tour.I thoroughly enjoyed the ghost tour. It was not so much of a tour as it was a planned theatrical show in the guise of a tour. Part of the purchase deal when the ship move to Long Beach was that it would never be used as a luxury liner, so they removed all of the boilers. It was this now empty area that was the focus of the ghost tour. Theatrically presented by our tour guide, who put on a mock-ghoulish persona. I found the entire presentation to be quite amusing and entertaining, plus we got to see parts of the ship not open to other tours such as the indoor abandoned swimming pool.Afterwards, I stopped to have an overpriced cocktail at the ships bar. I paid $12 for a Moscow Mule which would be four or five dollars anywhere else.If I were to do it again, I would not waste my time with a guided tour. Give yourself adequate time with the self-guided headphone tour and you will see everything and get a far more informative and entertaining, enlightening visit.",Mark M
40,First time I've been there in many years,"I was visiting my daughter in SoCal and we combined visits to the Queen Mary and Aquarium of the Pacific for a nice time in Long Beach. It had been years since I had been to the Queen Mary, but it has certainly been well-maintained. We purchased tickets to the Princess Diana exhibit that was there during our visit and it was very, very good. While I'm not a royal family-""groupie"", I have always enjoyed following the British monarchy, including years past. The exhibit started with information on George V and his wife, Mary and came forward to the newest heir, Prince George. There were many of Diana's dresses on display and a very interesting exhibit of the dresses, including the winning bids, from the Christie's auction held in 1997. It was interesting to note that the auction happened only several months before her death. Although the charity auction was considered very successful, it made one wonder how much more would have been raised had the event been scheduled a few months later. Probably an astronomical figure.Because we took so much time in the exhibit, we didn't get to see as much of the ship as we would like to. But, we have already planned another trip back - along with my husband, to enjoy their fine restaurant and to learn more about the Queen Mary. A really nice way to spend a beautiful day by the water.",Cheri S
40,The Queen has Something for Everyone,"Over the years, my husband and I have visited and stayed at the Queen Mary. Given that we live in Long Beach, it has become a tourist stop for our out of town friends and family visitors. Recently, we purchased 4 first class passport tickets through Amazon Local for $45 which is a great savings given that each ticket is $30.95. The tickets included a tour of the Russian submarine (not PC given the current conflict), an audio tour and a choice of the WWII or the ""The Glory Days"", and the Ghosts and Legends Tour. We climbed rapidly through the submarine (interesting but requires agility) and then chose the Glory Days tour which was quite enjoyable with a charismatic guide. The Ghost tour required more disclaimers since it was more than ""campy"" and the young woman had the loudest screams in her attempt to scare the group. The only interesting part was seeing the first class pool and part of the engine rooms. The remainder of our visit was more enjoyable with a wonderful dinner at the Chelsea restaurant and walking the upper decks during sunset.",sherrieseg
40,Historic Ship,"When we arrived in the late afternoon, there was a long line. There was only one ticket window open. We had to wait awhile. The person at the window was not very pleasant. She seemed not happy to be working there. There are several floors. If you have trouble with stairs or uneven floors, you may have some trouble navigating the ship. The self guided tour was nice. We walked at our own pace. We stopped at the bar to have a drink after the tour. The service was slow and once again the employees seemed like they wanted to be anywhere, but at work. The history of the ship was very interesting. The Queen Mary is worth the trip if you don't mind grumpy workers.",SanFranciscoMom
30,Ghost tour,The ghost tour was pretty corny for my 15 year old daughter and me. Low tech special effects made us giggle and the guide was very dramatic. I think this tour would be great for little boys and their dads.,Pam H
40,overall,"The attraction was clean very interesting and enjoyable by our family- 2 kids 13 & 15- the ghost tour although ""chessy"" was fun & entertaining & that is what it is all about. The lay out of the tour was terrible- to jump around from place to place and floor to floor- it seems from a tourist point of view & trying to read a map of a very large ship - the self quided tour could have ""flowed"" much better. There was one customer service attendent at the ""main"" question/inforamtion booth that was TERRIBLE- we all have bads days & maybe that day was hers & unlucky for me & my family- Rebbeca should not be in customer service, she was very short, rude and quite condisending. We did enjoy our outing and would return if given the opportunity again.",Emmie N
50,A good piece of cruising history - bigger than the Titanic!,"I was looking for a good place to try out for dinner and somehow ended out here. I didn't fancy the dinner but got curious about how the staff and other guests I overheard that were hyping up the paranormal activity happening on the ship/hotel.Tristan, our guide, was quite knowledgeable about the topic, got to the supposedly first class section of the ship down to the bottom of its belly, with some facts, creepy stories and stunts with a dousing rod and fancy light and/or camera tricks.Kudos to the Lady in the White Dress, Jackie, John and in loving memory of those who perished when the boat hit and sank almost 400 people of the Curacao.",LodRose
20,Do not pay for the tour. Only takes you around perimeter of ship other than the engine room.,"Advertising as the Diana Exhibition is misleading because it is more about the royal family than Diana. Lots of her dresses were not even original dresses and were replicas put on dolls. It was freezing in that area as well. Very disappointing if you want to see Diana memorabilia.As for the tour, we opted for the audio tour and were very disappointed. We kept running into other people who were lost, confused and did not know which was to go. There were no views of the cabins on the ship on the tour we went on, unless of course, we were too confused to find them. The staff were not informed or just didn't care about answering our questions. No help at all. We left early so wasn't worth the $15 parking plus the tour prices.",RMFOX222
30,Full of History,"The Skinny:Parking- $15 for the day, $7 w/ restaurant validation, if you are there after 1AM no chargeDecor- Art Deco, worn downRestrooms- updated and cleanService- friendlyIn order to roam the ship, you need to have purchased a ticket to a show, or buy a $15 dining credit per person which the restaurant will then credit your receipt. There are interactive maps that you can look at the different parts of the ship. There is a great gallery of Queen Mary history to look at and tours available if you want an in depth history. The ship is old and really is showing her age. It is pretty cool to walk on the decks and imagine what she might have been like at sea.The Princess Diana tour is great if you like her. My favorite was the dress section. You can easily spend 2-3hours depending if you read every placard available.The Ghost Walk Paranormal experience starts at 11pm on Friday and Saturday. The group size is limited to 25 and this tour is 3 HOURS. If you are at all skeptical, do not go on this tour or you will be super irritated. Lots of walking, no cell service and dimly lit areas.",melobeam
20,Dining with the spirits,"My daughter and I were in L.A. visiting from Florida and decided to do the combo ghost tour with dinner in Sir Winstons restaurant. We arrived for the dinner and we were escorted past beautiful tables with ocean views to a back room behind a curtain where they had folding tables set up with a window overlooking the parking lot! We were seated with 6 other people and then for at least an hour we had bread before our meal started. The soup was about the best, my daughters steak was covered in sauce she didn't like, and my chicken was dry. Then after the meal we were taken out on deck and clumped into another large group of 30 or more people for the tour. The ship has a fascinating history which makes the tour worth taking, but the ""ghostly"" areas are just dark unrestored areas of the ship and having 50 people with you it's not likely you'll be very spooked! I wouldn't recommend spending the money for the dinner, skip it and do the tour.",Kim T
40,Fun day trip,"Queen Mary is a fun place to spend a day roaming through the ship, looking out onto the water and Long Beach, and enjoying a nice dinner or beverage. I've never paid for the tour since you can see so much on your own, but I'm sure it'd be interesting.",NickyLabo
50,Did the day tour as well as the evening Paranormal tour,"Went to the grand ol' lady on two different occasions. First visit was for the evening Paranormal Ghost Hunting Tour. This was beyond great. I watch and follow all the these reality shows and this was like being part of them. The tour host/guide Matt was very knowledgeable about the ship and the Paranormal. I personally had some experiences - though you may or may not have any when/if you visit. You get to go to many parts of the ship that are not normally opening nor accessible to the general public of hotel guests. Matt even encourages you to take and use your own ghost hunting equipmentThe second visit was a few days later to visit during the day. The guided tour wasn't too bad. The start was a bit of a faff as the guide spent the better part of 20 minutes telling us about a single photo being displayed. I zoned out very quickly. He was very knowledgeable about the boat and all its statistic so don't be afraid to ask questions. There are some parts of the ship that are really starting to show its age and lack of maintenance. I'm glad I did both day and night tours and would highly recommend to others, especially if your into the Paranormal",Robert H
50,Must visit if you are in california,"Well preserved museum great experience if you are adore Diana you would love this place, it runs down the memory lane and you can really feel the beautiful out fits of Diana and feel her bouquet, the ballrooms were so beautiful loved the tea room, felt like Royal!",Shanika V

50,The Queen Mary,"If you have a chance, this is a must see! This ship has been restored and is absolutely beautiful.The Ghost Tour is kind of cheesy but still fun. :)",Amy B
50,Very well preserved!,"What a beautiful ship! I felt like I was sailing in the 1930's (although the ship is premanently docked) I didn't have the pleasure of seeing any of the 'hotel' accomodations, but the salon, the bar (extremely ornate) and the deck were amazing.",AZgigi
40,Amazing visit,"My wife and I toured this historic ship and had lunch on board. After lunch, we walked along the old historic wooden hallways, and in a way, took you back in time, and you felt what it must have been like back then….It is hard to envision that this ship actually contributed in the war effort and transported thousands of troops overseas.The interior of the ship has been pretty well preserved and had that “old look feeling.” Looking over her rails reminded me of the movie “Titanic.”The ship had a lot of sentimental memorabilia throughout the ship, which we got a kick out of seeing. Overall, our experience aboard this ship was wonderful and we enjoyed ourselves.Since 1929, there was talk about replacing the Cunard’s aging ships, the Mauretania, Aquitania, and Berengaria with a new pair of super ocean liners.In 1930, this 1,000 foot ship began her life known only as ""Hull Number 534"", when the first keel plate was laid at the John Brown shipyard in Clyde, Scotland.• Legend has it that the board of directors at Cunard decided to name the ship the Queen Victoria, which would have been in keeping with the tradition of Cunard ships having the ""ia"" suffix (Mauretania, Aquitania and Berengeria). As per protocol, legend states that the Cunard directors went to ask King George his blessing of the ship's proposed name saying, ""We have decided to name our new ship after England's greatest Queen,"" meaning Queen Victoria, the King's Grandmother. Upon which the King is reported to have stated, ""My wife (Queen Mary) will be delighted that you are naming the ship after her. And so, the legend goes…From 1931-1934, the Great Depression held up the Queen Mary’s construction, but despite suffering economic setbacks, the Cunard Line spared no expense in completing the build. The building of the Queen Mary becomes a groundbreaking technological achievement.On May 27, 1936, the Queen Mary made her maiden voyage.For the next 3 years the Queen Mary hosted the world’s rich and famous across the Atlantic including the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, David Niven, and Sir Winston Churchill, to name just a few.Unparalleled extravagance and forward-thinking technology make the Queen Mary popular with British Royalty, Hollywood celebrities and dignitaries, raising the bar for luxury travel and ultimately becoming the grandest ocean liner ever built.Considered by the upper-class to be the only civilized way to travel, she held the record for the fastest-ever North Atlantic crossing.In 1939, when WWII started, the luxury travel ceased and she was transformed into a troopship and known as ""The Grey Ghost.” Her passenger capacity was increased from 2,410 to 5,500. At end of WWII, the ship had carried more than 800,000 troops, traveled more than 600,000 miles and played a significant role in virtually every major Allied campaign.On October 2, 1942, The Queen Mary collides with British light cruiser Curacoa. Seventy tons of cement is used to temporarily patch the bow in Gourock, Scotland.In 1946, when the war ended, she transported more than 22,000 war brides and their children to the United States and Canada (she made 13 voyages) and was known as the ""Bride and Baby Voyages.""In July, 1947, the Queen Mary was refurbished and resumed her elegant cruises, maintaining weekly service between Southampton, Cherbourg, and New York.Late 1950s, the Queen Mary dominated the transatlantic passenger transportation market until the dawn of the jet age.Early 1960’s, transatlantic cruises were falling out of fashion as more people gravitated towards air travel, which was becoming affordable for the masses. The Queen Mary was aging and though still among the most popular transatlantic liners, was operating at a loss.In 1963, the ship began a series of occasional cruises, first to the Canary Islands and later to the Bahamas.In 1967, she was withdrawn from service after more than 1,000 transatlantic crossings and was sold for $3.45 million to the city of Long Beach, California, for use as a maritime museum and hotel.On December 9, 1967, she made her final voyage to Long Beach and was permanently docked and soon became the luxury hotel that she is today. Reborn as a hotel and attraction, the Queen Mary has become a Southern California historic landmark, offering people an opportunity to step back in time and experience the grand days of ocean liner travel.On September 30, 1992, the Walt Disney Company gives up lease on the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose property. The Port of Long Beach becomes operator of property, and looks for new operator. “Hotel Queen Mary closes.”On February 26, 1993, the Queen Mary reopens to the public with self-guided and guided ""Captain's Tour"" resumes. Most restaurants and Sunday Brunch are back.",Holdtheair

50,Historical,"I go to the Queen Mary several times a year. There are lots of events and things to do. The latest event was the Princess Diana exhibit which we attended followed by afternoon tea in the adjoining restaurant.We've attended Art Deco events on this Art Deco ship. The Art Deco rooms are gorgeous, particularly The Queen's Salon. Many consider it for their wedding venue. Will try Winston's Restaurant sometime.",ClassyJewel
50,Loved it!,Would love to come back. Only stayed one night before cruise ship. It was really handy because Long Beach cruises depart a 100 yards or so from the Queen Mary's dock. The room we had was a standard double which was huge! the bathroom was beautifully and sympathetically tiled and fitted out. Art deco lights etc really were lovely. It was very pleasant to walk the decks after a lovely breakfast. Worth the money.,Jotravelnut21
10,Tourist trap!,A complete rip off! Everything that could have been remotely interesting on board was either extra charge or closed to the public. The only thing available in abundance was overpriced gift shops. We really felt cheated. Admittance and parking was $150 for a family of five. It should have been no more than $25 all together. Stay away!,Gunn Iren
10,Miserable,"We went to the Queen Mary 4th of July event with high hopes. The description made it sound like a trip back in time to enjoy the past decades. I am amazed at how a description can be accurate yet miss so much! What they don't say is that there is NO seating. Literally, no where to sit! You end up walking around in circles the entire day (12hours), or sitting on the floor somewhere. Even the shows don't have seating! We finally decided to get something to eat at one of the restaurants so we could relax for a bit and sit down, and we ended up waiting for a table for THREE HOURS. Apparently people were lingering ""longer than expected."" I wonder why...perhaps it was because there was NO WHERE ELSE TO SIT! Save yourself the drive, the time and the money and DON'T GO!!!!",misnmik .
30,good for a few hours - if you like this type of history,Been a few time and good to pass some time . Not the greatest just average. I would skip the food there other places near by. Its ok for folks who like boats but would not spend more than a few hours.the fire works on the week end are a treat and can be seen by near by locations shore line lite house park or at queen Mary.,food e
20,"Paid a great deal for an odd, disquieting experience","Not a cheap afternoon.Arrived early afternoon on July 3. The ticket area is not clearly marked so as we came off of the parking lot we made the (erroneous) assumption that tickets were purchased under the big maroon awning. We purchased the Scorpion submarine tickets independently and then discovered there was a main ticket booth. At no time did the gentleman who sold us tickets ask us if we were here to see anything else and when we purchased tickets for the Queen Mary they would not take any money off of the pricing even though we had our receipt in hand (chalk it up to a $16 error on our parts). We waited a long time to purchase tickets and there were only three couples ahead of us. This should have been our tip-off for the entire experience. Walking to the stern of the ship to pick up our audio guides we discover an overset employee surrounded by headsets making the announcement that he would be with us when he could. There were less than a dozen people waiting (four groups) and we wondered what he would do if it were actually crowded. The ship itself was delightful though many parts were closed off or inaccessible as they prepared for the next day's 4th of July festivities. We missed our tour by less than three minutes (still before the appointed tour time but as we did not get our tickets scanned prior to the 'start' time we could not join the end of the tour we were, in fact, on time for) and headed up for tea. We were told that they closed in ten minutes and they would no longer seat us and walked away. By this point we were $66 in for two people and then paid $15 to exit the parking area.If you go, go early. Plan on 2-3 hours. Be VERY early if you want to take a timed tour. Be prepared to wait. Look for the ticket booth situated in the parking lot.",reaneyweather
40,Visit for the history and ship itself,"This review is for the ship itself, separate review for the hotel. My boyfriend who is a big naval history guy, loved exploring the ship. We got to access the ship since we were staying on board so I can't speak to price for value. It was fun exploring all the nooks and crannies in our own. We did take the ghost and legends tour, primarily because he wanted to see the engine rooms and the pool. The tour is like a mini-haunted house with lots of kisch. It wood be nice if they had a paper brochure explaining where all if the cool places and historic pictures on board were. You really only get the details if you take the audio tour.The restaurants are on the expensive side, especially if your staying on board. My favorite place was the bar/lounge and they have live music on Sat nights.",EuropeCosmicTravel
10,Disappointing 4th of July event,"The Queen Mary itself is a beautiful ship. Walking around in the ship is cool. However, the 4th of July All-American event was a tremendous letdown. It was cheap, unpleasant, overcrowded and a bit of a waste.The website advertised that there would be different areas of the ship set up as different historical eras - a speakeasy, a carnival, etc. That sounded great in theory. What it meant in reality is that there were a handful of very overcrowded rooms with costumed dancers or performers that came out every so often. The performers were excellent, but there was nothing there that made you feel as though you were in the 1930s, etc. The 1910's carnival = one guy dressed as a barker (very good, but working alone) and the same sort of booths you find at the OC Fair. The ""60's beach party"" was a room with some beach balls and tribute bands. The 80s area was downright pathetic - a dark space with a small checkerboard dance floor and a few cutouts of Nintendo characters.There were three other areas that were VIP - more $$. Tours? Sorry, that's going to be more $$. Basically, your $40 let you walk around an overcrowded ship.It cost a lot of moolah to get on the ship, and then the food and drinks were outrageously priced. I spent $4 on a slice of pizza and it was cold, undercooked and absolutely unpalatable. I didn't bother returning it because the line was 30 people deep.Some of the staff was really helpful; some of the people were very cold. On my way in, someone grabbed my arm (that was in a bandage) and immediately stamped it - hey, staff member, is there any reason you couldn't have asked or let me know what you wanted, instead of grabbing my limbs? Bathrooms were filthy and some of them didn't have toilet paper or towels.The fireworks were spectacular but I feel as though I could have just sat on the beach or across in Downtown Long Beach and seen them with less of a crowd and less money out of pocket.",283Anonymous
30,"Nice hotel, rude staff","We stayed for just one night as a stop off on our way up the coast.The ship is an impressive sight in the docks of Long Beach, inside parts are tatty and old but then anything modern would look silly given the history. We have a deluxe room and it was spacious and comfortable, with lots of old bits and bobs to make it feel authentic.We had a good look around and enjoyed it's history before having a drink in the promenade bar.The staff were over worked and too ages to serve us ignoring us for ten minutes before rudely asking what we would like and then snatching my money from me. Not the service you expect in USA and as such a tip was not forthcoming.Comfortable nights sleep and would recommend a stay perhaps for just a night or two as anymore could become tedious.",GrandTour401233
40,Fireworks awesome but hold on to your wallet.,"First off, I love the Queen Mary. She is beautiful and it is always fun to go aboard. With that said we decided to go to see fireworks on the Fourth from her deck and enjoy the history. We arrived early parking was plentiful, we got tickets and reserved the ghosts and legends tour for later in the day. Lots going on and a huge crowd all over the ship by 3pm. The ghost tour was full and as we were led into the bowels of the ship I was fascinated by the historic corridors of the once proud ocean liner. Apparently the guide was in a hurry and we were rushed along. That in itself was forgivable but the lights and constant noises of fake apparitions were so over the top it was laughable. The guide did not seem to know any of the history of the ship beyond the ghost stories he had told countless times. Cool to see the shops interior would have been nice to actually see it not the put on lighting and projected phantasms. The events and entertainment on board was ok. The burlesque dancers were probably the best. The Katie Perry tribute singer was probably the worst but all entertaining enough. The fireworks themselves were awesome. However, the crowds were kinda overwhelming and even though we went to claim ourselves a spot on the deck almost four hours before the fireworks, the crowds were such that the shorter members of our party still had trouble seeing them. There was no where to sit and everything was extremely expensive (hamburgers $15, very small almost raw piece of pizza was $6, sodas were $4) none of which I minded but not a cheap day with family and friends by any means. Also could somebody, and I am looking at you Long Beach, do something about the grand old lady's paint and either tear down or develop the area surrounding the Queen. Those ""sea port village"" buildings have been empty since the Spruce Goose left town. It's sad our history is left to decay.",kryptoknightxxx
10,All American 4th of July Event,"Yesterday my wife and I attended the All American 4th of July event at the Queen Mary. Although there was a veteran’s bike tour event at 11AM and an opening flag ceremony at 11:30AM, the majority of activities for the general public started at noon. Numerous events were scheduled up to a fireworks display at 9PM. So, for anyone that wanted to make a day of it and get their monies worth it would be a 10 hour day on the Queen Mary.We arrived around 3ish and made our way onto the ship. The crowd ranged from babies in strollers to couples in their 70’s. As we made our way slowly around the ship I noticed there were probably 6 seats for every 500 people. I estimate several thousand people were in attendance.There were several small temporary food stations on the outer portion of some of the decks. The food was severely sub-standard for any venue, even more so for a place like the Queen Mary. The food must have been prepared in a central kitchen and then transported to the outer food stations and kept only luke warm. Frankly I would not be surprised if some people became ill from bacterial growth due to storage conditions.There were 3 full bars open to the general public that I was aware of: The Observation Bar, The Tiki Bar and the bar inside The Chelsea Chowder House. There were temporary bar stations near the temporary food stations but their selections were limited. We tried to get a second round of beverages at The Observation Bar but were turned away as that bar was at capacity. We made our way to the bar at The Chelsea Chowder House and had some drinks in there. About 7PM we tried to get a table for dinner (remember, this event goes until 10PM) at The Chelsea and we were told they were no longer taking names for dinner seating. It’s not like there were dozens of people waiting for a table, so what kind of planning is that? I asked the bartender if we could order food to eat in the bar and he stated they do not serve food in the bar. I’ve never been in a restaurant that didn’t serve their own food in their bar.We eventually ended up at The Observation Bar since they were still serving food. The menu was basically hot dogs and hamburgers. We both opted for the $16 bacon cheeseburger. Now, I didn’t expect this to be a gourmet quality burger but what we received was terrible (photo attached). The bun was appeared to be a week old, removing the bun bottom and banging the edge of the bun against the table caused no damage to shape of the bun. The cheese had long ago dried solid on the meat, which was dark in color and dried out. I expect the burger was made sometime that morning and stored away.I don’t know if this the first year the Queen Mary has had this event, but I know they have had plenty of large events in the past and I am surprised at the poor quality of preparation they had for handling crowds of this size (especially for an event that last this many hours).",Ed R
20,Beer in a Bucket of Ice Does Not a TIKI BAR Make!,"Bought the Deluxe VIP pass to the Fourth of July celebration to ""Step back in time aboard the Queen Mary [to] celebrate a century of Americana"" Newspaper and on-line advertisements promising music of the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 80s sounded interesting. Lists of food vendors and ""lounges"" sounded like fun. We went to the ""Pizza Pit"", found a young man standing behind an empty table. No sign of pizza. Went to the ""Route 66 Diner"", ditto. Young person standing behind empty table. 21/2 hours later, food did show up but is was packaged in single serving portions and had obviously been prepared in an off-site kitchen. While strolling the Promenade Deck, we could see families crouching along the rails; parents were handing out sad looking bits of cheeseburgers to their tots. There were far to few places to sit. We decided to cheer ourselves up with a visit to the ""Tiki Bar"" We found a folding table with a bucket of ice sitting on it, bottles of beer shoved into ice.The music was even more disappointing. All the music was electronic, over amplified rock version of whatever era was advertised. Did not see one live musician. They may have been playing the songs of the advertised eras, maybe the lyrics, but couldn't tell because amps were turned up to 11.Very sad. Feeling ripped-off.",Diana V
10,Our tour guide didn't care and we got lost because no one wanted to help,"THIS WAS AN AWFUL TOUR. ""The ghost tour"" is a haunted house directed by employees that don't want to do their job. The ship was beautiful but the tour was AWFUL.",Hreiher
50,Homecoming,I love staying aboard the Queen Mary. She is so nostalgic and all the people who work there are friendly and nice. They are like family and I always feel as if I have come home. I love the rooms because they make me feel as if I have transported through time into The Queen's heyday of the 30's and 40's. It is a very special place for me.We come every February for the Scottish Festival and stay the whole weekend. I am hoping to come for our anniversary again.,Jackie B
50,Golden Era,This is a fantastic experience. Walking along the ships corridors still in almost original condition was amazing. Did a guided tour with a guide that had an excellent knowledge of the history and workings of this old beauty. Also did a self-guided tour and just wandered through the hallways and took in as much history as possible. The engine room and preserved propeller exhibit is well worth seeing. Also did the submarine walk-through next to the Queen Mary. This gave us a great insight to what the men went through in that era,Mark H
50,Have tea on the Queen!,"Our family reunion took us to Long Beach and the Queen Mary, who retired to Long Beach in 1967. A white-uniformed ""Captain"" took us on a tour of this luxurious ship which housed celebrities and military personnel in her long career.Today you can stay overnight in the 4.5 star hotel on board.We didn't do that, but my husband and I took our daughter and her two girls (9 & 6) for tea in the white tablecloth room with elegant waiters. Scones, caviar, clotted cream, petit fours with tea and wine. There is a Little Royal Tea for children.At present there is an exhibition of royalty, including Princess Diana's dresses.Very enjoyable!",ndegan
50,"Fun, nostalgia, experience, memorable.",We stayed on board for one night before flying out to Sydney. Very memorable. We had the Eisenhower suite which is almost totally original. Massive space and real good fun. Really gave the feeling of travelling in olden first class style. We ate at the Winston Churchill restaurant and enjoyed the self guided tour also. A true memorable highly recommended experience.,ozdivergt
50,Not To Be Missed,"A wonderful trip back in history. Excellent tour of the entire ship, including the amazing engine room. I would also highly recommend staying on board for a complete experience. The rooms are almost entirely authentic with some minor concessions for modern convenience.. Just be aware you will be staying in an 80 year room.",Bill A
40,A trip back in time,The rooms were clean and the tours helped set the stage for us to imagine what it might have been to stay here (minus the ocean movements). We found the food / meal service more like a fast food place- so that spoiled the charm and we didn't stick around to eat. The boat guide was the opposite- very engaging and very conscious of the era he wanted us to imagine.,Gay T
40,Queen Mary,"The Queen Mary is a good tour. However, plan on spending most of the day. The part of the ship that serves as a hotel is kind of interesting and I think it would be fun to spend one night aboard. I wouldn't want to spend more than one night due to how small the rooms look. All things considered, if you visit Long Beach, you should really plan on spending a day looking at the Queen Mary.",Cowboykw
40,Back in Time,Enjoyed thinking about the years my parents enjoyed the ship. Great staff. Room was nice but old fashioned. Missed the modern touch. Great visit. May do this again...,bpi45
30,Historical night tour,We went on the historical night tour at 8:30 on a Saturday night. The tour guide did his best to show us a good time but then he took us to public areas there were guests not on our tour talking over our tour guide which resulted in our guide to yell just so we could all hear him. There were two weddings going on so he couldn't take us to many areas. Sad really as we were very excited to see the queen mary. I don't think we got the most out of our tour but the things we did get to see was very interesting. Just wish we had gone on a different day.,babysnoopy154400wsh
50,Queen Mary is a great Tour Experience,"Definitely have comfortable shoes on and try to see all you can. There is so much to see and so much history to learn about her. Did you know that the Queen Mary is a larger vessel than the Titanic? The Queen Mary had so many duties including military. It is just an amazing boat. Stay the night in the hotel, or spend a week there if you can. It's close to everything and what a way to vacation!",i l
40,ENJOY A TRIP BACK IN TIME,"We had lunch on the ship and wandered around afterwards. Buy a voucher for $15 to allow entrance to the ship (there are guided tours that you can purchase also) but can use the voucher towards a meal. We ate at the Promenade restaurant which was the cheaper of the two offered for lunch. It was very pleasant and the food/service were quite good. Apparently there is a self-guided tour that we could have picked up but didn't find out about until later. It's lovely to see the brass and woodwork of the old fittings on the QM - kind of a trip back in time. We had a wheelchair for my mother and some of the decks are difficult to access, requiring a few steps up or down but we managed and enjoyed our afternoon.",LindaWanderer2013

I had visited the Queen when in town visiting a relative about 26 years ago. the Queen is the same, lots of history on it...probably not as appreciated by current and future generations as past. The area has also changed with the departure of the Spruce Goose, the little shops between the two have all closed up. Dinner was good and we were able to wander around some of the decks. It provides a good view of the harbor and downtown Long Beach and waterfront.",bills83au

I did #2 and was quite happy. You could easily spend a few hours checking out the ship.,lucycan
40,Dinner & Dancing,"We were on the Queen Mary for a conference event. We had the Grand Ballroom and there was a really good band playing big band music. The food I had was good, but I was disappointed the selection did not include any gluten free options except raw vegetables and dip and skewers with tomatoes and mozzerella. Probably not the Queen Mary's fault, probably was the company sponsoring it, but still disappointing as we hadn't eaten dinner prior to coming. Luckily we had some chips & salsa in the Queen Mary's lounge prior to the event. Held us over until we could pick up some In N Out Burger. We walked around the ship before the event started and I really enjoyed walking the decks of the ship and seeing the historical pictures. Also loved looking in the shops, particularly the Scottish shop and the one with all of the Queen Mary merchandise. Picked up a couple things for myself and something to take home to my son. I'd love to stay on here for a night someday. Hopefully I will get the chance.",Buffy24

If you scare easily, don't spend the night on board.",Bev B
20,Average,"We stayed in the Queen Mary as part of a tour of the West Coast. We were only there for one night which was more than enough! We had an enjoyable couple of hours exploring the ship and eating in the Promenade restaurant. The problems began when we went back to our room. The walls are so thin that we could hear every word our neighbours on both sides said. Then later on a fight started out in one of the neighbouring rooms. I called security a number of times only to be told it was being dealt with by the duty manager. This went on for a while, once the fight was over people stood talking outside our room for a number of hours. We had to leave at 7am for a connecting journey so I had hardly any sleep. When we checked out we were not asked how our stay had been or if everything had been ok. Generally really disappointed in the whole experience. Only wanted to visit as my family had travelled on the Queen Mary a number of times.",loopylou157
40,"Unique Experience, Nice Diversion in Long Beach","We took visiting family here and enjoyed the afternoon. You can walk the deck and engine room on your own for free. We also did the paid Ghost Tour, the ""apparitions"" are pretty chessy but because the ship was a real operating ship with a history, made the ghost stories seem more real and the kids found it scary. The tour also took us down to the bowels of the ship in boilder room and to the inside hull, which was interesting for us adults. For the price, it was worth a visit.We stayed on board to watch the sunset and have dinner at the casual restaurant and the food was surprisingly decent. Would take other LA visitors here.",LuvtoSafari
40,Good tour of the Queen Mary,"The Queen Mary tour is an audio tour that takes you throughout the boat giving various information about each section that you are in. It is narrated by an ""assistant"" of the captain and is informative. The ghost tour is cheesy yet fun and okay for kids. If you go during the week it is not terribly crowded so you can see everything without a problem in about four hours or less.",Daisy
30,The Queen was OK,We stayed one night and we did enjoy the history of the ship but the rooms were average. It was fun to have done it once but we probably won't go back.,Bobby R

40,Sunday Brunch,"Visiting the Queen Mary is always interesting due to its colorful history. Part of that history is visiting the dining room. On Sundays, the Queen Mary offers a Sunday Brunch in the main dining room. Parking is fine and the ship is a short walk from the parking lot, which costs $7.00. Brunch is pretty good, fairly standard as brunch goes. There is good variety, a couple carving stations and custom crepes for desert. Bottomless champagne is a nice touch. The cost is a bit high, coming in at $50.00 per person. After brunch you're allowed to roam the ship to work off the extra calories.",Flint5oh
30,Tours are expensive,"The tours are way over priced you cannot purchase a single tour you must buy a ""package"",. A typical tourist attraction--gift shops and more gift shops",cadmanrich
40,"Pricey, but worth it if you can find a discount","I visited the Queen Mary earlier this week while I was visiting Long Beach and my friends were at work. I used the Groupon discount to see the Princess Diana exhibit for half price. This was a nice exhibit, but only partially had to do with Princess Di, so it was a bit misleading. There were a few of her dresses, but the majority of the information was about the royal family in general, beginning with Queen Mary toward the beginning of the twentieth century. I felt like if I had spent the regular price of the ticket (close to $30), I would have been unhappy. I spent awhile reading all the information carefully, and spent about an hour and a half in this exhibit. I noticed that most weren't reading, and just looking, so they probably finished in less than an hour.I wanted to learn more about the ship in general after the royal family exhibit, so I did the ""Glory Days"" tour, which was added on for another $9. They had other options that you could add on too, like the ghost tour. I had Bradford as a tour guide, and he was very good. His stories made the history of the Queen Mary come alive.I used the Long Beach bus system to get to the ship, which was awesome! Very adorable, and the drivers were very helpful with guiding the tourists. The Passport bus route, which goes to the ship and the aquarium is free.",MGM1123
40,Enjoyable Time,"We vacationed in LA for a week and decided to take the half hour drive down to Long Beach to visit the Queen Mary. We arrived about 9:30am on a Sunday and didn't realize the ship doesn't open until 10am. We opted for the self guided tour and the Ghosts and Legends tour as it was a one price deal for around $28.00.The Queen Mary was once a touristy cruise ship but when WWII started, it became a troop carrier ship to Europe once carrying 16,000 soldiers.Hitler even had a bounty on her and offered a reward if anyone could sink it. After the war it went back to being a cruise ship until 1967. There's several levels to explore, from the bridge all the way down to the engine room. Parts of the ship aren't in the best condition but this isn't a modern day cruise ship. The ship is a floating hotel too and also has a bar/restaurant and a few gift shops in which some aren't related to buying souvenirs from the ship but rather jewelry, Chinese trinkets and other items.The Ghosts and Legends tours was a great time. We do not believe in ghosts but wanted to do this 35 minute guided tour as it takes you down deep into the ships old boiler room (boilers removed long ago) and a visit to the ships indoor pool. It first begins with a short video presentation then you follow your guide to the indoor pool and they try and scare you. Next is the boiler room and...well I won't give away any more. You have to just go do it. It's worth it just to see parts of the ship not normally open to the public. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour and recommend it.We had an enjoyable time exploring this bit of history. You can easily spend half a day or more here. We've cruised on modern day cruise ships several times and still liked being on this ship.The Carnival cruise terminal is actually located just in the rear of the Queen Mary. The only thing I'd wish they would do is have a restored passenger room available for viewing. I'd love to see how the ship's rooms used to look like. If your in LA or anywhere in the area I recommend checking out the historic Queen Mary.",Aerowing
50,Fascinating history lesson!,"We took the ghost tour of the below-decks area formerly housing the boilers - WOW! The ship is in amazing condition and it was so interesting to hear about its history and see the beautiful lobbies and salons. We noticed that the $15 parking charge is reduced by $8 with a restaurant validation, so we had lunch in the dining room and really enjoyed looking out at the lovely view from our table.",keepdancin
50,WONDERFUL DAY filled with History !!!,"We visited the Battleship Iowa, the Scorpion Submarine and the Queen Mary in one FULL day...(if you have children, it would be WAY too much). Our experiences were terrific. The staff is professional and enthusiastic - I am enclosing a picture of our tour guide, James - he was perfect... He seemed to enjoy teaching us about this wonderful vessel. The ship is maintained in grand shape and I felt like we were going back in time. The wedding chapel is ideal for a small wedding and we saw one that was set-up outside. There are many restaurants/pubs that serve good food and drinks. We enjoyed walking through the old stateroom floors (today it is a functioning hotel). Go, enjoy a piece of history when we were happy to be in a slower time.",Patricia W
50,Must-see Attraction in LA Harbor,"We thoroughly enjoyed our day aboard the Queen Mary! We opted for the Passport, which included the Ghost Tour, Guided Tour, and Audio Tour, which was way too much to do in one day. We should have opted for just the Guided Tour with the docent. (Although comprehensive, the Audio Tour is difficult to follow, and we had trouble following the directions to each stop; the audio-players were often troublesome, too.) Nonetheless, we had a wonderful time exploring this marvel of nautical engineering from bow to stern, imagining the vessel in its glory days, ferrying queens and movie stars and soldiers to and fro across the Atlantic. We particularly enjoyed seeing the old equipment on the Bridge and marveling at the massive engines and propeller in the Engine Room. We also enjoyed a good lunch at a reasonable price in The Promenade Cafe; afterward, we browsed the various shops. Next time we visit LA Harbor, we will book a night or two in one of the state rooms and enjoy a Guided Tour of the Grand Dame. Highly recommended!",Patricia M
40,Dtay,Good place something different to do for our short honeymoon very romantic. Very quiet. The Russian submarine scorpion was not worth it since I'm a American submariner I guess there's nothing better than American. The Queen Mary overall a great experience. Like spending the night in a museum.,Dante C
50,A Trip Back in Time To The Glorious Days of Atlantic Crossings,"We were at a business conference, staying at the Hyatt Regency, and looking at the Queen Mary. We decided we must take a tour, and we were happy we did. It was really great. We had a rental car, and it was just a short drive (less than two miles...some friends walked and took a shuttle back). You pay $15 for parking, but it goes down to $7 if you have anything at one of the restaurants or bar. They have a variety of admissions. We opted for a self-tour with nothing else included, and were able to see everything we wanted to in the space of about 2.5 hours, including a stop for drinks and some really nice kettle chips at the gloriously Art Deco Observation Deck bar with its nice mural. Great vintage cocktails! Friendly service as well. We started at the top, touring the Bridge and Captains Quarters, the worked down to the Promenade Deck and the Observation Deck bar, then kept descending decks, seeing the glorious ballroom where they serve Sunday brunch, the stateroom halls (people were checking in throughout), the exhibit area showing the ship through the decades, with many pictures of the dignitaries, stars, etc. The WW II exhibit area was very compelling. The we went to the Prop Room (wow on the props!), the electrical room and the engine room. You come away with a great sense of the elegance of the era it sailed in, including the incredible conversion to a massive troop ship in WWII. This is a very definite ""don't miss""! Well worth the visit, and truly memorable. Right underneath it is a Soviet Era Scorpion submarine that can also be toured.",Conseiller99
40,Interesting visit...!,"Made a quick visit during a recent stay in Long Beach. She's not lost her elegance and she's still a grand old lady. Particularly interested in the ghost tour, but concerned to see it described as 'weak'?Can't understand why people complain about queues? They are inevitable at attractions such as this! We didn't have to wait as we arrived early, walked straight in! Enjoyed a pleasant breakfast in one of the restaurants. Buffet style and surprisingly good!Spent the next few hours just wandering around the ship wherever we wanted which was great. All areas well presented and plenty of information around if you need it. Asked a maid cheekily for a quick look inside one of the unoccupied bedrooms which was very politely declined! Would love to stay overnight....Well worth a visit, will go again next time I'm in the area as we didn't have too much time when we were there.",Nokia33103310
50,dinner on the Queen Mary,we had a very large party and I was amazed that our service was good. I enjoyed my meal. We went to the bar afterwards. The ship was very nice. The wood floors were recently polished I think because they were very slippery - I had to be very careful to not fall down!,WendyW2
50,Great Long Beach Landmark,The Sunday brunch is by far the best in all of Southern California. Take a tour of the ship and appreciate it's history.,jdsinger6758
50,"Quick, free stop for photo opportunity.","We did not tour the ship itself, just stopped for photos. FREE 30 MINUTE PARKING, just follow the signs to the property then counter clockwise around the cruise ship building and park in the flat lot within sight of the ship. Great photo op for The Queen Mary, Russian submarine, Catalina cruisers and harbor. Use the restroom, grab a drink, back to the car and out in 30 minutes. The parking attendant scanned our ticket and waved goodbye.",ruzz2112
40,Scottish Engineering and Workmanship at it's Best!!,"We stayed aboard the Queen Mary (now a hotel) on a recent visit to the Pacific Coast. It was like stepping back in time. The cabin washuge compared to modern cruise ships,with r eal wardrobes! The bathroom had the original shower fixtures -with an option to have a cold saltwater shower! (fortunately these are no longer in operation!) The museum part was extremely interesting and comprehensive; apart from seeing how the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cabins and dining rooms were set out, there was the chance to view the engine rooms. The exhibits were well presented. During the war the ship was used to transport soldiers and there was a very interesting section about this time in her working life. I was also very impressed with the Deco look throughout the ship- 56 different types of wood used in the finish-from all parts of the British Empire at the time. The dining room is the largest room ever to be built on a ship-seating over 800 diners! The walls are festooned with old black and white images of the famous people to have sailed in her-David Niven even doing a highland fling. As well as being a floating hotel, it is used for conferences-a dance one while we were there; and can also be used for weddings on the sundeck.It certainly made us proud to be Scottish!",lindahazlie
30,Go for the History... not to sleep,"beautiful ship, great food in the restaurants. Starbucks on board!but the stateroom walls are PAPER thin so it sounds like the neighbors are in the rm with you!! Add a screaming baby to the mix and .... well lets just say you better bring some earplugs!!!Also they really need to add some lounge chairs to the massive deck space to bring back that cruise ship feeling!! Much more could be done to make grand old ship a better place to be!",402dougw
50,It's an experience.,This is one of the place that you have to visit when you visit Southern California. Great place to spend the day.,Naveenwicks
40,Queen mary fun for kids,"The Queen Mary is a bit past it's prime but still worth a visit. Grab a bite on the queen and stroll around. Little kids will enjoy just climbing all over everything while adults will enjoy the views, history and any one of the exhibits from Princess Diana to the haunted hotel. We went for breakfast this past weekend and spent a few hours with our five year old exploring the ship. He loved it!",701LongBeach
50,Fun afternoon,"We went expecting to spend an hour or so touring the ship and wound up spending 4 hours. We did the self-guided tour with audio and had lunch in the Promenade Cafe mid-day. After lunch we roamed around the upper decks which had great views and more audio tour stops. We then did the Ghosts and Legends tour which was included in our Passport/Aquarium package - it was a little cheesy but entertaining. Fun, self-paced afternoon.",Stacy W
30,Waiting for the cruise,"We arrived at the Long Beach Cruise Terminal quite early in the morning and had a couple of hours to wait to board the ship. I had read that the Queen Mary was also there and thought we might check it out. We discovered that it was VERY close - just a few hundred feet - so after checking in at the cruise desk, we walked over to look. We were reading the information about tickets and tours, when the lady asked if we were here to board the cruise. She said that you could enter for free with your cruise card, so we walked right in. We were able to walk all over the ship and see the beautiful old parts. Had a cup of coffee in the Starbucks on board. The brunch that they were serving was $30+. Overall, a good way to spend the extra time. Yes, the ship has seen better days, but it was a nice walk through the past - and didn't cost anything.",cedar4604
30,Time for a facelift!,"We were in this area over 10 years ago and I don't think there's been any improvements since then. This beautiful ship is looking very tired and in dire need of a new paint job. In its present condition, it won't bring in the tourists much longer.",JeanYHZ
40,Nice to see,"Very nice tour experience. Not great, better than average. We did the haunted tour experience with our young children, and it was pretty cheesy as expected but fine overall. The ship was nice, and there were several opportunities for history exploration. There is a banquet hall with a primitive ship locator showing its course across the Atlantic. This was really neat, and the room itself was my favorite. Overall, worth the effort but I enjoyed the USS Iowa far more. The attached Scorpion (Russian submarine) was equally nice, but not stellar. The gift shop had a lot of stuff with hammers and sickles if your wardrobe lacks that proletariat communist flavor.Perhaps more exciting than the haunted ghost tour was actually getting to the ship by travelling the 405 highway (the busiest and most congested freeway in the US according to the geniuses who write for Wikipedia) down to Long Beach. This high-octane, higher-speed, near-death, NASCAR experience was far scarier (and cheaper) than the haunted tour. It was a 'comprehensive' experience. Overall, very nice to see. The staff was excellent at both places, and the haunted tour guides were quite funny.",jolleyzoo
20,Hidden fees,"This place has a lot of hidden charges that they don't mention. Parking fee was $17 for self service, valet was $20. On top there is a $9.95 booking fee plus a $15 service fee. It is a ship; however, the bathroom was very old school. The toilet does not flush properly. The towels were worn out. If you are in for a historical experience it is a good place. I hated the fact there were lots of fees that they didn't mention.",Dylan201
40,"Great tour, POOR ticketing experience!!","Toured the Queen Mary this past March with my wife and daughter. Very frustrated at the ridiculously long line to get tickets. The line stretched back so 30 yards, and it took almost 45 minutes to get through the lone and get on he the ship. Given that March is no high tourist season, I can't imagine the wait to get on altering the summer! When I went up to the ship entrance, the girl at that ticket window and the two gentleman staring off into the parking lot (nothing to do) explained tha the one and only option is to wait in the line at the far end of the parking lot. We LOVED the ship, would like to come back, but won't be taking things to chance to get tickets next time. The crew of the Queen Mary needs to examine their molasses slow ticketing and make some adjustments!",Mikrich76
40,Queen Mary historically worth visit,Give yourself 2-3 hours to wander around the ship & for the Princess Diana display. This is actually a wonderful history lesion from King George V & Queen Mary through to Princess Diana.Main restaurants not available at lunch. Ran out of time to see Russian submarine.,2011Margaret08
50,Very informative and nostalgic.,"We opted for the evening historical tour which was only $12 a head. Our guide was a mine of information, delivered in a very informal style which held our attention. We toured the grand public rooms which are triumphs of Art Deco style and obviously the height of luxury in their day when travelling the Atlantic was done in true style.Although it would have been interesting to see a stateroom, this was not possible as every room was occupied by hotel guests. Nevertheless, this was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",PBY54
10,Waste of time,"Terrible organisation. There was only one person in the ticket office and a long line waiting. Some people seemed to be having difficulties with online pre-purchases and the line got longer and longer. 30 minutes wait in the sun to get a ticket was no joke......and we were only fifth in the line when we joined it.Was it worth the wait? No. The tour route was poorly signed, the lifts did not work properly, and there was not a lot to see. The ship is trying to fulfill too many purposes: hotel, restaurants, functions and tour. It is not organising the tour at all well. Avoid is my recommendation.",TowerTwo
50,Excellent,While in long beach i visited the queen mary it is a magnificent ship a must if you are in the area. Great food and Service.,Spinksy7
40,A high point of our honeymoon,"We stayed one night on board as part of our honeymoon and were simply blown away by the whole experience. I'm a big fan of Art Deco and my wife is a fan of Princess Diana, so it ticked both of those boxes. For me the design and architecture was superb, I ran out of disk space on the camera! The exhibition was interesting and not 100% Diana, thankfully.Dining was good at lunch and for the evening we dined in Winston's. Food was wonderful and the service even better. We have friends locally, who joined us for cocktails - great selection, good service and reasonably priced.Memories to cherish. Thank you.",modwolf63
40,Impressive structure,"We happened to be in Long Beach while our daughter was working so we decided to see the Queen Mary. I was glad we did. I was overwhelmed with the structure just walking up to it from the parking lot. We did the audio tape tour, which they have just started to use. The hand held remote was a little touchy. The directions from one stop to another were given quite quickly, so it took us a while to discover the easiest way for us to manipulate it. The tour was complete and full of interesting facts and took us from the Captain's wheel to the propeller room. We also took the Ghost tour, which was not up to par with the quality of the ship's tour. We had lunch in the Promenade Café. It was a beautiful setting. Good service. Good Food.",Carol765
50,Still a classy attraction,I hadn't been to the Queen Mary in decades but it is still a great place to spend the day. We especially enjoyed their ghost tour -- don't miss that. The food on board is great!,Karen K
30,Good as a visitor Poor as a hotel guest,"Pros: As a hotel guest you can roam the ship anytime you want, you can go in and out the ship as you please.good views, very historicDowntown trolley stops in front of the ship , so we didn't have to use our car going to the waterfront/pike.Staff friendlyCons: sleep not comfortable due to very thin walls, I can clearly hear nearby guess talk in the middle of the night, guess arguing lost finding there rooms,we ourselves were lost finding our room despite the receptionist giving orders because the rooms and hallways look all the same..no clear signs for directions, the cleaning stuff we asked for directions didn't give us enough help,some unable to respond in English. Recommending that the management place big ,clear signs were rooms located at the reception area.Parking fee was expensive ($17/self parking 4 20 for valet) even for hotel guestThey should have just added the fees ( wi-fi, etc) to the room rate.Just make sense to see clearly how much I'm paying when I book a room. Seemed like its a cheap stay but when you add all the fees, the cheapest room can be $150/nightCell phone signal is lost in the rooms, so I cannot use my phoneIf I don't want to eat in the ship restaurants,there are no No walking distance restaurants or stores in the vicinity. We had to commute for that, I used Restaurant Hunter app again ( google play) to search for restos in the area, mostly in the waterfront and downtown area. Overall I guess its okay to see it once for historical reasons but not a place for returning guess. Other places to see and spend money elsewhere.",Trina S

40,Good Luncheon Venue,"Salads, sea food and service - the three Esses for the Queen Mary. Recommend lunch. Stay away from the incredibly weak ""Ghost Tour"".",jrjojo
40,Princess Diana Exhibit,"We visited the Queen Mary primarily for the Princess Diana Exhibit. The exhibit was excellent and included many, many items and documents relating to Diana and the royal family. There were many of Diana's personal items and writings. We spent several hours in the exhibit and could have spent much more. We also toured the ship and found it quite interesting.",Jim D
40,Skip the guided Tours,"The Queen Mary is a ocean liner the really gives you a sense of what ocean voyages were like at the peak during the 1950's. We thought the guided tours would tell us something of the history of the ship and the people who traveled on her, but they're a waste of time and money. The Glory Days tour takes you through a couple of the main rooms but was guided by a clown who kept on talking in a weird voice thinking that this would make the tour more ""entertaining"". But the grand old ship is its own attraction doesn't need a buffoon to describe the the ship going up and down in the waves using an absurdly theatrical tone of voice. Just get the audio tour and explore the ship ,on your own, and enjoy one of the restaurants while you're there.",nexxen_11
30,A Classic Icon,When I was a little my family and I would always gaze across the bay at The Queen Mary as we were loading onto the Catalina Express getting ready to go camping. I always wanted to explore the ship. As an adult I was able to make this happen. You can tell that the Queen was once very Majestic. I really enjoyed learning of her history and seeing photographs of all the Military and Famous people who both were able to appreciate her. As one might imagine at this point in time The Queen Mary is a bit run down but she is also extremely old. I enjoyed the views of the harbor from the deck and wish that I would have had more time to just enjoy relaxing in the sun.,KRL32
40,Corny but fun,"My sister and I went on the queen Mary haunted tour, and had funThe history of the vessel was interesting but the tour was very corny. The fake ghost noises and the lights was funny.once in this lifetime was enough for me. I wished that we could of toured more of the ship and seen some rooms.",amand l
50,Nothing Like It,"Should you want an experience that can take you back 60 years, this is what you need to do! The Sunday brunch is held in the arte deco ballroom (food is terrific although the waiters have far too much to do and there can be a delay in getting items you request), but the food is varied and excellent. Also, you can walk around the entire ship (the round portholes are a special draw to me) afterward and walk off what you ate, viewing the well-labeled historic photos on display. Assorted gift shops, and stop at the Observation Bar to feel like a first class passenger in 1940. Truly unique.",Joybagg
10,Horribly run down !,My family and I have been visiting the Queen Marry ship every since its been in Ling Beach . I haven't been to the ship in about 6 years . We use to go every time I went to California but gave missed a few years . This time I found it to be a horrible faded out rust bucket . The ship looks like it us ready for the bone yard . I can't believe the way it has been let go . It was always a highlite of our vacation to take myself and our kids on the ship . This time I had my son inlaws and grand kids for the first time there and could not believe the condition of the ship . Then 30 dollars to board her ! No way maybe 10 and I would have done it . I really miss the grand ship she was because now she is nothing but an old rusty faded out tub .,Fuznuts
10,Terrible Experience,"My wife was really excited to see this ship from inside and it was mainly because she loves the movie Titanic. She pictured the ship with comparable beauty and elegance.But this ship is no where close of being a luxury ship in decor. The ""haunted"" show was terrible where they take you to the engine room and try to scare you. As surprising as it will sound but you can see the entire ship in 20 minutes because most of the ship is just corridors of rooms after rooms. Just think of an ordinary hotel where there is a small lobby, couple of restaurants and the rest are just rooms.The captain's room and some other rooms on the deck level were good and gives you an opportunity to imagine the life on the ship.I think the ticket prices are way over-priced for the experience. It would have been ok for $10 ticket but not $30.I can understand that some people have a connection with the ship since it was commissioned in WWII to carry thousands of troupes and seeing the ship that carried their father or grand father during the war would be different experience.But for a tourist couple like us, it felt like waste of money and time. In my opinion, if you are from out of town then skip this attraction since LA has lot more to offer.",AG201341162
50,The 'glory days' Queen Mary,"I was relieved to hear that the Queen Mary has been placed on the USA's Register of Historic Places. Having just visited Las Vegas where history comes second place to popularity and 'old' means 1980s, I knew that this great monument to 20th Century ingenuity remains in safe hands.We first visited the ship in 1999 and did not take a guided tour. I lamented this decision for the next decade as I did not see the famous public lounges and dining room.Taking the opportunity of a 10-hour layover at LAX, we hired a car and drove down to Long Beach and promptly purchase tickets for the 3.30pm 'Glory Days' Tour. Our guide, James, was faultlessly presented and we looked forward to hearing stories of the rich and famous who had patronised the Queen in the 30s,40s and 50s.Unfortunately the hour long tour was disappointing. James' commentary would be best suited to a school group and sadly failed to illuminate his charges with the wonder of this great ship. He delivered a well drilled badinage of eye rolling, hand gesticulation and corny banter.Other than walking down one of the 1st class corridors toward hotel reception, we saw nothing more than a general admission ticket provided.Our disappointment was bridged when a knowledgable gentleman advised us to take the elevator to R level and quietly view the famous dining room by sneaking in an unlocked door..... We did the same at the Promenade Deck to glimpse the Grand Salon.My advice is to 'freelance' on general admission ticket as no one will stop you entering the 'hotel' area from Promenade deck.My advice to the Administration of this great attraction; please respect the Queen Mary and her visitors with tours worthy of the ship's creation and history and the public's intelligence.",KevinK594

I've stayed in the hotel once, eaten at all the restaurants at least once, and been to a wedding, a banquet, and a conference. They also have periodic interesting museum type displays, such as Princess Diana's dresses. It is especially appealing if you like the art deco style, even though it's a bit run down around the edge. Also - don't miss the Russian submarine right next door. There are fees for tours, but if you go just for dinner or drinks you only pay for parking.",yaloobloo

On your way back from the QM, you could stop here for a stroll by the beach and yacht club or grab a meal at one of the many venues. Certainly plan 3 hours to visit the QM, and longer if you plan on taking a tour or having a meal aboard of course. You can also stroll on your own and still find helpful historical information. You may decide to stay on the QM - it has a very nice spa/hotel. I suggest looking into their website.",LaPuce1228

For the past year, it has also housed an exhibit of Princess Diana, her clothes, the china and fineries of the British aristocracy. Parts of the ship are open to roam around in and take in. There are also spectacular views of the oil islands and the shoreline of Long Beach from various terraces. The ship has restaurants and bars with interesting menus for visitors to have lunch. Sir Winston is an elegant dinner place that serves more formal options.",Evelina62
40,Cool place!,"Fun to explore, has lots of history of the history buff, fun info for kids on boats (with old submarine next door!), live music at nights, restaurants and hotel accomodations for a date night out!",Gamze G
40,A little bit of history & art deco,"It's pretty cool to see the insides of a cruise ship- especially one with so many wonderful art deco features. But it still feels pretty old. It's a great place to take kids and there is a ghost tour. I highly recommend the art deco bar as a place to take visitors. If you say you are going for a meal, then sometimes you can sneak in without paying admission and still walk around many of the exhibit areas- definitely the decks. For history or art deco buffs, staying at the ship's hotel is a unique adventure.",MyWineAdvisor
30,Do take the guided tour,"The Queen Mary is a classic must-do if you come to LB, and the way to it for any first-timer is by taking the guided tour. No spoilers, but it is a hair-raising experience. Lots of history and great views.",AdrianaSibaja
30,The Queen has lost some of her lustre but she is still Afloat,"On a business trip to the Long Beach community, I was staying at the Residence Inn, down the road from this long time attraction. As a kid, I visited this attraction with my family when Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose was also featured next to the Queen Mary. I believe the Spruce Goose has been moved to the Pacific Northwest. .At that time I found the whole attraction both exciting and interesting. From the nearby closed English Village, this attraction looks a bit dated and weathered. Though is must cost $$$ to maintain this vessel. I found the rear engine rooms the most interesting during this visit. I had lunch on board one it's many dining establishments and the food was average and service was poor. I visited during a weekday so the attraction was not crowded. I noticed there was a wedding being set up on the ship as well as a outdoor reception. Still, if you are large ship buff or interested in it's rich history then this might be the attraction for you.",SeminarTrekker
40,Afternoon Tea,"Nicely served scones and cream (not clotted), but tea served in a pot. Helpful staff, nice location in the ship. A bit pricey.",jane_turner53
50,A tick off my bucket list,"This was on my bucket list and I was extremely lucky to get the chance to go on a guided tour. My husband and I toured California as part of a Thomas Cook tour for our silver wedding, ten years in saving but worth every penny. The visit to the Queen Mary was a highlight. We were shown around by the Captain and it lived up and surpassed all my expectations. It was vast and we spent quite a few hours exploring especially round the engine rooms. One word to sum it up Amazing",yorkierose67
40,Nice tour of a grand ship,"This is for people who enjoy history. The ship is nice but could use a little fixing up in the common areas if you are there staying. You can walk around the whole ship self guided or with a tour. The engine room is neat and seeing the propeller in the water was very cool. The ghost tour has video or something but it was broken but they let us take a different tour. Good staff. I would go back but not dying to. It is worth a trip to see it. The bar has some of the best decor as far as seeing it in all its glory. The gift shop was way over priced, more than Disney type prices.",Michael H
40,Great History,"This will keep you occupied for hours. Do the WWII tour & the Ghost Tour, then do the audio tour. All worth the time and effort. Warning there are a lot of stairs when you are navigating all the tours. We walked throughout the ship at least 6-7x during the 4 hours we were on the ship and our thighs ached for 3 days afterwards - mind you we are in good shape, too. Enjoy!",Maria G
50,Great stay,"Had a wonderful one night stay on the Queen Mary. My stateroom was B311. Very vintage and cozy. The big plus, was that there were two operative portholes that allowed fresh air in. Nice views of the bay and the city. Had lunch and drinks onboard. Everything was great!",sdcruiser52
40,"Elegance, history and fun","I put off touring the Queen Mary for 3 years but after my day there I would say if you like history and elegance take this tour. Remember to ask for senior citizen rate. I also had toured the submarine previously so they accommodated me and let me take the Ghost tour, the WW II tour and the Glory Day tour for $30. Each was unique and dealt with different aspects but each eas well worth the time. For this you can also pick up the self guided audio tour but I much more enjoy the individual tour guides. On the WW II tour the young man told us additional stories he had picked up from WWII vets who had taken his tour. The ghost tours are not scary but a 10""yr old freaked out and quit the tour so know your children before taking it. I loved the elegance still present on the ship. I regret never having stayed in the hotel but it is still a deal if you want a unique experience. The shuttle called the Passport will take you there from various spots around the harbor for,free. Please don't wait like I did. I gave it only 4 stars since it was hard to find a cheaper place to catch a snack in between tours. Be aware you must be able to use stairs to take tours",101NDTraveler2013
40,We did two guided tours,"We did two guided tours, both of which were interesting, informative and well worth the time & cost. We were able to go from the very top to the very bottom of the ship an the very back to the front. We saw the engine room, all the way to the wheel house and almost everything in between. If we ever go again, I'd get the audio.",E N
50,A Great Time for Tweens and Teens!,"After reading other reviews, I was cautious about touring the Queen Mary when I took my 13-year old son and 14-year-old daughter during our Spring Break the first week in April. Our ticket included a self-guided tour of the ship and two tours. We went to the Ghosts and Legends show/tour (1/2 hour) and took the Haunted tour (1 hour). Exploring the ship on your own during the self-guided tour is very cool and you can move at your kid's pace. My teens really liked imagining they were old-time travelers. The day we were there was beautiful and not crowded at all. The Ghost and Legends was more show than tour, though they do take you into some parts of the ship. It was interesting (you see the indoor pool) and the guys who performed it were funny, but deadpan, speaking in Hitchcock-style voices. We then went on the Haunted tour. It was amazing! Our tour guide, Armando, was wonderful--super knowledgeable! There were only 6 people (us three and a 10-year old boy, a father and an energetic grandfather were the others) in our group (which I understand was small, so that made it seem even more special). Our guide answered any and all questions, and really tailored the tour to our particular interests about the Queen Mary's history. You really get to see a lot of the ship on this tour. We felt like it was designed especially for us--even if it's what everyone gets! It gets pretty spooky down in the bottom of the ship's boiler room and you can really feel what it must have been like back in the 1930s. One weird thing happened while on our tour: while passing through a narrow passage way (it was nice to have extra personal light on our cell phones--it's that dark) a huge door smoothly opened just as we walked by as if someone was coming in or out!! The father from the other group, who was bringing up the rear, saw it too, tried to close it, but it opened again. When we all got out of the passageway, the man asked us if we saw the door open? We had!! Armando said that in all his years touring that had never happened before! My kids we're thrilled! Later we had coffee/hot chocolate and sandwiches on the deck and talked all about our tour and the ship. The Queen Mary may not be in the shape she was in her prime, but the architecture is still fantastic (all art deco) and fun to explore. This is a great day trip for a family. We had way more fun than we thought we would.",KaiHanaMama
30,A faded Old Lady.,"This was the last tour we did before flying home, and though I am glad we went to see the QM, it was sad to see her in such a tatty state. She is obviously used as an hotel, and we did get in to see the Churchill Suite (used by him during WW II), as it was unoccupied that day, but I would advise anyone wanting to stay there that the room was rather jaded. We did both the Ghosts & Legends, and the History tours. The G&L tour was informative, but too theatrical on behalf of the guide.....she scared off one young boy at the first exhibit! If you can listen with tongue in cheek then the history of the ""ghosts"" make a good story, and it was interesting to see the small size of the then indoor swimming pool, and also the bowels of the ship. The History tour was ok. We were short on time so did not explore as much as we would have liked, but what we saw was enough. The attached Russian submarine was a revelation in how to cram lots of things into a small space and a good add-on to the ticket, though not a good place to go if you are claustrophobic!",Louis and Judi L
30,"Certainly historically cool, but very run down and pricey","Meh.....can I score a 2.5 stars?That's about the best I can say. They have turned the once elegant lady into a tacky, tattered shadow of her former self. No attempt seems to have been made to keep her clean and polished. We were told at the ticket booth that our admission included a free tour, so we thought why not? When we joined the tour group, we found that it had no historical significance whatsoever, but was a truly ridiculous ""Ghosts and Legends"" tour. Pure crap. We left the tour and returned to the booth. If we wanted the historical tour, we had to pay $5 more per person. More for the truth than made up crap? Whatever. You can also ""self-guide"" through certain areas of the ship which is what we ended up doing. It is cool to use your imagination as you stroll the sundeck and stand beneath the gargantuan smokestacks. Some interesting info on plaques about the ship's use to transport troops during wartime. Overall, not worth the price, but it was a sunny day and we were headed back to LAX.",BolingbrookKaren
20,Expensive and not worth the money,"We were really looking forward to this part of our trip to Long Beach but what a disappointment. Instead of the glory of a luxury ocean liner we were reduced to trailing around a lot of empty decks with no ghost of the glamour of cruising in one of the world's most luxurious liners. A faint trace of the glory days was visible in the one bar that was not closed for a function (why do these places think it acceptable to charge the full fee to visitors and then close off half of the attraction because of functions!) we had booked to go on the 'ghost' tour as we had children with us but in the event they decided that it was to scary and when we asked if we could change this for entrance to the Princess Diana exhibition we were told that we would have to pay and extra $16 each although the original difference between our tickets and one allowing entrance to the exhibition was approx $5!All in all a crashing disappointment, I advise spending your hard earned money elsewhere.",HillWalkerCanterbury
10,Disappointing,"I was with a group of coworkers. I wanted to do the traditional tour of the ship, but others were interested in the Ghosts and Legends tour, so that's what we did. The Queen Mary has been docked in Long Beach for nearly 50 years now, and it shows. The Ghosts/Legends tour took us down to the bowels of the ship. It was dirty (Solo cups from the bar, Doritos bags, candy wrappers, etc), and there were unused furnishings/pictures just kind of thrown in the corner. It really took away from the historical aspects of the ship. The tour guide was mediocre at best. He took us to a 'haunted state room' and it was an empty shell of a room. It could have been any room on the ship, nothing special there. We spent a fair amount of time in the bar afterwards. It was neat to be able to go outside on the deck of the bar, but the drinks were extremely overpriced. The QM is owned by the City of Long Beach, and with cutbacks, etc, it shows a great deal of neglect. Lots of touristy shops on board too. I'm glad to have visited, but it was overpriced and unimpressive...very sad.",Liz N
20,$15 to park ! ?,"This review is for the Russian sub on display at the Queen Mary . I had originally planned to tour the Queen Mary and the Russian sub , but the cost to do both was higher than I wanted to spend , on top of that , If I parked for more than 1 hour, the parking fee was $15 ! The cost to tour the sub was $15 and parking was $5 . But , come on City of Long Beach , $ 15 for the privilege of spending more money in your city ...not again for me ! On top of that , the booths , attractionslooks and the inside of the sub were all run down and in need of a major face - lift .",pizzalover270
40,"Love being on a Cruise, Be here on a Cruise hotel","Haunted Hotel is what i would name it as. Yes you heard it right... The Queen Mary is a beautiful ship converted into a hotel and it is haunted. RMS Queen Mary has tours to offer and you can go around the ship with a guide. It has various things to offer from The Ghost and Legends Tour to the World War II tour. Near to the ship, you also have a russian submarine called scorpion. you can do both of these tour which is fun and exciting if you are a cruise person and love paranormal activities - lolP.S. - there are no paranormal activities here but guest have reported of such activities in certain area of the ship.",Ashlesh
50,An exciting history lesson,I went to the Queen Mary mostly because I heard it was haunted. The Ghost and Legends Tour is a lot of fun but keep in mind they have a few simulated scares so small children may be frightened. Guests are able to wander throughout the ship without a tour guide so it is very easy to spend an entire day there. If you enjoy learning about history and like ghost stories this tour is for you.,StephanyQuintal
30,Not really worth the $,The Queen Mary tour was not worth it. We spent 100 dollars for a family of four. I would not recommend it unless you're an avid historical ship fan.,Rania G
40,Those were the days of travel.,"We went there with the metro to long beach from union station. Then there is a free shuttle to the ship. wonderful,what a way to travel in those days. had a drink at the bar, pity the barman was miserable. views from the ship are very nice.",234Joost234
20,Ghosts and Legends Tour was disappointing,"Maybe it's just that my expectations were high, but I was really disappointed with this tour. We did the ""Ghosts and Legends"" tour, as opposed to the Haunted tour -- the website is a little confusing with all the different tours available -- and we did the combination with the Aquarium Tour. ""Ghosts and Legends"" was an interactive tour that's supposed to be scary. Our tour guide was lifeless, monotone and almost robotic like. It might have been that that's the way he was instructed to play the part, or it might have been that he's given the tour so many times he's bored out of his skull. In any event, instead of scaring us, it almost put us to sleep. The best part was seeing the boiler room which was 36ft below sea level and you go to the bottom and look up. It's daunting thinking about the men who used to shovel coal into the boilers. When a boiler would overheat it would explode and burn a man to death, pealing off his skin instantly. What a horrible job.There was a self-guided audio tour looked more interesting. If you're a steamship buff, this is probably a better way to explore the ship.",Kate0206
30,Get a First Class Ticket,"We should've read the advice about getting the First Class ticket. Our admission included the Ghosts and Legends tour, but lacked the self guided audio tour or even better yet, the guided tour option. The Ghosts and Legends tour was cheesy but fun, taking you into the depths of the old ship, including the first class pool and down to the boiler room. After that, we were left to wander the ship and explore on our own. Definitely worth the extra money to get the tour!",Genius09
50,You can touch history,"This is worth the trip and a visit however I think the parking is outrageous. 17.00 to park!!!!??? Also I got there 1 hr before they closed and paid that much for parking. The Bar is cool, and it was great just to walk the the decks. I didnt like how there was so many desolate spots but it might have been since they were closing. if you are in the area it is worth the visit, how often would you be able to set foot on a ship that is as close to the Titanic that you can get.",JayR1984
50,Go see the Princess Diana Exhibit,If you are one of those people that love the British Royals you gotta stop and see this exhibit! We have been to see the ship before so this time we went just to see the Diana exhibit and it was awesome! We spent 3 hours just looking at all the details of this exhibit! This is one of those places that depending on your interest level you could spend all day checking out the ship with the self guide headsets ... or most of a day reading and taking in all the details of Diana.After the Diana exhibit we wondered around the different decks which of course have great views of Long Beach. We also wondered down some halls to see what it might be like to stay there since it is a hotel too - not sure I would stay the night but I can't judge what I didn't do. It just seems a little cramped and not a lot to do on the ship after the tour areas close at the end of the day.,ItchyFeet
40,Queen Mary a Must,"If you like ships and/or cruises, then a visit to the Queen Mary is a must. It is really interesting to see this older ship and how the rich crossed the Atlantic. Be sure to get the 'First Class' ticket and take the 'Ghost & Legends' tour and the 'Glory First Class' tour. Plus, the ticket includes a self-guided audio tour. Wear sneakers and be ready to walk and climb stairs (great exercise day). Also at the sight is a Russian submarine to tour. There are restaurants on the ship. And if you have the time, you can even stay overnight in one of the cabins.",Roger S
40,A Unique Journey into British History,"There are several options regarding ticket prices providing admission to varying combinations of attractions to include a special exhibit dealing with Princess Diana. The basic admission is $25 although there are a few discounted rates for military, etc. We opted for the combination ticket for $42 which gave you the basic admission to both the the ship and the nearby Aquarium of the Pacific. We considered touring the optional Princess Diana exhibit, however, passed as we learned that a single admission was a rather excessive $16.95. A 30-minute ""Ghost Tour"" did come with the basic admission. Although perhaps a bit too theatrical, it was interesting to tour the lower levels of the ship that are not otherwise accessible. You will be walking down several levels of stairs, so if stairs are a problem you may want to pass. There is an elevator that will take you back up after the tour.The basic tour is a self-guided one, however, you can rent an audio phone which takes you through the ship by predetermined stops. Do not miss the tour at the rear if the ship on the ""D"" Deck/Wharf which tours the engine room, WW II exhibits and examples of the different classes of guest room interiors. Allow at least 3 hours to see all of the decks and exhibits, although it may take somewhat longer based on your interest. Be prepared to hand over $15.00 for parking on your way out. Somewhat expensive in my opinion. Recommend the tour if you are visiting Long Beach.",Terry B
30,Twilight Tour- Interesting But Not Amazing,We booked the Twilight Tour as something to do to avoid traffic after picking up my wife's mom at the airport. The tour and the boat were generally interesting but nothing I'd go way out of my way too see. Our guide was extraordinarily knowledgeable about the boat and naval history in general. It was fun to find out later that my wife's grandparents had sailed on the Queen Mary when they immigrated from South Africa to the US. I am a big history buff but the Queen Mary just wasn't over the top for me.,TheSpeis
40,Lovely to see and explore!,We spent a very pleasant rainy afternoon aboard the Queen Mary exploring and loved the art deco bar. The ship had a lovely atmosphere and it was easy to imagine how luxurious it must have been in its day. There were some interesting little shops to browse and plenty of souvenirs to buy if you so wished. We had considered booking accommodation but decided against it and were glad as it was showing its age somewhat. The service in the bar was good and we took the opportunity to peep inside some of the salons and the wedding chapel. It was interesting to visit the engine rooms and to see the exhibitions on board.,Christine S
40,Great History Here!,Wouldn't want to stay but loved seeing the ship and imagining the events that took place there. Definitely worth seeing.,LOWA191968
40,Fun place for a visit,"We were part of a convention that used the Queen Mary for an evening event. There are several larger salons that were used for presentations, while the shops and the ship itself were interesting to see. The Queen Mary is from an earlier time, but is still an impressive ship.",SnowDude
50,Special Experience,"6 of us from a Long Beach business conference decided to go to High Tea on the upper deck of the Queen Mary. Actually it was the girls idea. But 4 of us guys decided to tag along.I'm sure it was a combination of the good company, ambiance and mystique of the old ship mixed with the quality of the food and service but we all had a great time. The ship is truly something to see and the High Tea service was a treat. We were all pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the food offerings and the tea choices, not to mention the very friendly and efficient service. It was all first class. She is an old lady and does show some of her age but a trip to the Queen Mary is a unique and very enjoyable experience. By the way, at just $15.00 per person (Tea and food), High Tea is a fantastic bargain. Go with friends.",O2006
20,Tired and unattended,"I expected to go back in time, I didn't expect a new fancy hotel. As a previous guest years ago I ""knew"" what it was like to stay there. However what I didn't expect was to spend nearly $300. 00 for 1 night in a room that smelled like mildew, the comforter was stained heavily with yellow stains and regardless of asking the front desk the people in the room adjacent continued to argue until late into the night. Upon arrival, the clerk at the desk was nice and offered an upgrade for only $60 more, but the room she described sounded like it had a sitting area, not a separate bedroom with a twin bed, something that was totally unnecessary for a retired couple with no children. We just accepted the upgrade and have chosen to never return. There was a huge crew of people all over the ship preparing for the launch of some kind of new yogurt so many of the areas were off limits for the entire time we were there. And the ""launch"" of this product wasn't even for 24 hours. The staff seemed disinterested in attending to the needs of us as this product was front and center stage. I will not be returning, which is sad. A little bit of housekeeping and attention is all it would take to get this place back to what it used to be.",cdawncrane
40,MAJESTIC OLD HOTEL PRESERVED IN LONG BEACH HARBOR,"Once the largest passenger ship in the world and the choice of kings for transatlantic travel, this ship has been in Long Beach since its decommissioning in 1967. Long Beach bought the ship to spruce up its harbor and this works very nicely! The ship serves as a hotel and the 2 guests we spoke to said it was comfortable and enjoyable. We walked all the floors we were able to get to and found the ship a little in need of sprucing up. The carpets looked old in parts for example. The gift shops are nice enough but not special. One attraction that is interesting is the Princess Diana exhibit of robes she wore and other memorabilia of her tragically shortened life. This is an add on but is worth it for someone who has a special interest in Diana's life and the life of royalty in England. Another attraction is the ghost tour that cuts through the boiler room among other areas of the ship. It is a little hokie but I still kind of enjoyed it.",cmschw@comcast.net
50,Hotel with class,"We stayed on the Queen Mary, there for a meeting. It was so elegant and different than any place we've ever stayed before. The meeting rooms are so elegant and the story behind the ship made it fun to explore! Rooms not huge but very nice and charming. You can't beat their Sunday brunch!",typqueen
50,..Indeed a Grand Lady of The Sea.,"..Well worth the admission cost to be able to walk and explore such a piece history, esp to be made more aware of her WW2 role. To walk the broad timbered decks, allowed ones imagination to conjure up sights and sounds of by gone times.The observation lounge great place for a drink to soak up more atmosphere.",JohnandDeanna
50,Very Exciting!,Was so excited to stay on this old cruise liner from the 30's! Was so cool. great price. fun exploring the ship. Vending machine's awesome haha.. The rooms are really nice.. Not very soundproof though between our room and the next but didn't really care. Can't wait to stay there again in April 14.,Mel L
50,Still Amazing After All these Years,"We attended a formal dinner event in the Grand Salon a few weeks ago and all I could think about is how amazing and ""grand"" the Queen is after all of these years. The venue and setting were perfect and the room was regal. The band made the room come alive. The wait and bar staff were great i.e. when I asked for the sauce on the side for my husband's salmon they complied (I think that means the entrees were not already platted and under the warmer). We had a great evening and hope to be back.The only drawback I can think of is the price of parking.",Quitobaby
40,Historical boat with nice atmosphere,"We had dinner at the Churchill restaurant, nice and classy but expensive. Great for a nostalgic or romantic evening.",pommybattler
40,Superb Ghost Tour and Service,"First, let me start with the ticketing agent, she was very accommodating, there were 8 people in our group(mostly seniors) but we only paid half, we got a big big discount. We purchased the general admission with royal package that includes the exhibit about Princess Diana. I was the only one who was interested in the haunted history of the ship so I got the extra ghost tour.I've done several ghost tours and this is one of the best! We visited different parts of the ship that are considered ""haunted."" It's cinematic with lights and sound effects, which make it more creepy. If have enough time I would have done the Ghost Passport Tour.",psydz
40,"Fun, both times",Been aboard the ship twice.... once for the Princess Diana exhibit which was very good and packed with memorabilia not only from Diana but the royal family including Duchess Kate...... I can still clearly see Diana in some of those iconic gowns. The second visit was for the Haunted Tour which proved to be a lot of fun. Our guide had a theatrical background which added another element to the tour. The boat is steeped in history. Being aboard is like a wistful step back in time to the gracious days of travel. Definitely worth going to see.,Year_of_Tiger
50,Cafe,"Table at window beautiful view of bay. Chipotle patty melt, chicken Chinese salad was great. Good service",Joyce J
50,Awesome,"To go aboard this magnificent ship was a treat. The audio tour is a must, it took us 2.5 hours and we didn't read everything by any stretch. One can only imagine how wonderful it must have been in its heyday, certainly there is enough to get an idea.",Tanglewild
50,Perfect lazy day just strolling the ship....,Went here by myself while a friend registered for classes. Honestly I really enjoyed it. Didn't need to park as I was dropped off so can't complain there. I used a Groupon.....so worth it. Highly recommend. It came with two tours the Diana exhibit and the self guided plus the submarine tour. I didn't get to see it all (roughly 4 hours spent on the ship). Ghost tour was fun and exciting. The legends tour done by James was great. James is a excellent tour guide and recommend u ask for his tours. I can't fault the queen mary because for me it was just so exciting to see and hear the history of this magnificent ship. The staff were all really nice and helpful. It was clean and believe me checked out everything I could while on the self guided so no smells or trash were I roamed. The ship felt so empty in parts(probably due to the time of year and day) that I could snoop around and that was exciting. Diana exhibit was so special. What really got me were some of the outfits I remember her wearing when I was a little girl and seeing them on the news or in magazines....but now they were right in front of me. Overall would love to go back with friends and maybe even stay the evening.,Travelfanalicia
30,Looking a bit sad these days,This old lady was once the greatest ocean going liner but time has certainly taken its toll. I acknowledge that it would cost many millions to get her back to her former glory and that the money simply isn't there but I felt a little sad that she has fallen into this poor state.I enjoyed the visit as a nostalgic experience but I really couldn't recommend it as an attraction unless you happen to be in the area with some time to kill. I also think that they could reduce the cost of going onboard which seems expensive for what there is on offer.,UKcritic
40,Food was excellent,"On the evening of New Year's day, there were over 300 in my group who enjoyed a great meal on board the Queen Mary. We were chaperones & members of a high school marching band who had performed in the Tournament of Roses Parade that morning and finally were able to relax and enjoy a little down time. The dinner was held in the Windsor/Grand Salons which included a dance floor. Although only a few of the students danced, the dance floor was very large and they had a DJ on stage at one end.The meal we had was very good. I thought it was the perfect amount of food: actual 'portion' sizes of salad, chicken & vegetables. Just the right amount to be able to eat every delicious bite & not waste any like at many restaurants. Only the desert was a little much (unless you are a choco-holic!). There were two pieces of the most decadent chocolate fudge brownie you've ever seen. It was hard to eat more than one.After the meal, we were able to walk around the ship. None of the shops were open during our visit, but it was interesting to see what this old ship must have been like during it's heyday. The décor of the ship is beautiful. The view of Long Beach at night was spectacular also. I think it would be fun to spend a night or two on board.",3-SLB
50,Very enjoyable visit,"I have spent a couple of hours visiting the ship together with a friend. It was really nice, the ship is really huge. If you get tired, you can relax at one of the on-board cafes.",Adrian L
40,Nice place to visit,I liked to have the opportunity to see this ship that is part of the history of the world but needs to have more maintenance to keep it pretty.,Alberto M
50,Day on The Queen Mary,"We spent almost the whole day on this cruise ship, which has such a lot of history attached to it. From the carrying of the troops in the 2nd World war, to being a cruise ship. Fascinating historical tour, right down to the ships propeller and engine room Included in our tour was an old Russian submarine which is moored beside the Queen Mary- The Scorpion. Another fascinating tour of interest, especially being able to tour it from one end to the other. Complete with torpedo's, and notices warning you not to touch anything as it's still in working order!We bought food and drinks from a coffee shop on board, which were excellent.The only gripe I have is the confusion and high price for parking, which you only find out about when you leave!",Munchkin8
30,Just Ordinary,"An old ship that you can see some of the rooms in made into a hotel and you can have a decent, but expensive brunch (around $40 per person or more.",Chris S
50,Loved the bar and the room and the food,I loved the whole thing. From the front desk staff to the restaurant food and the bar. The boutique had a fabulous purse that people ask me about all of the time. The history was amazing too. Just felt great to be there.,Julie C
30,Parking Fee Warning,"I am living in a motorhome and driving around the country seeing as much of America as I can. Having taken two Atlantic crossings on the Queen Elizabeth 2, I have an interest in old ships, so drove in from the state park where I was staying to tour the Queen Mary.Ticket pricing is confusing. Apparently, I could not simply purchase an audio tour of just the Queen Mary, and I ended up buying a ticket for both that ship and the next-door submarine, which I never used. The ticket lady kept saying that this was the most popular ""passport"" when I asked about an audio tour of just QM. (I told her I just wanted ticket options and they should call them tickets, not passports.) I suspect there was another ticket available, but it was very confusing. I still don't know what options were available and what I should have paid.Most upsetting was finding out that motorhome parking costs $40 after I had parked and left my vehicle. There was nothing about parking costs on the website, nor nothing outside of the parking lot about costs, or even just inside the lot. (I drove back after I left and looked for it.) Apparently, there was a small sign somewhere in the parking lot, but I could not find it. Car parking is $15, and I understand my vehicle takes up space allotted for two cars, but I would like to be notified about this cost BEFORE driving 40 miles, not after I parked and asked about costs!! I complained to management and they were very apologetic and offered to reduce my parking fee to $30, but this was not the point. This should be clearly posted and listed on the web site, not hidden. They did only charge me $15 as I left, but my whole point was not to get cheap parking, but to insist on clear signage and notification about costs. I have not been charged for two+ vehicles anywhere else in the 34 states I have traveled in.On a positive note, I really did enjoy the audio self-guided tour of this marvelous old ship. I already knew a lot about its history, but it was great to see this ship in person, so to speak. I could see similarities in the later Cunard ships that was interesting. Worth visiting in spite of poor customer service.",J B
30,"QUEEN MARY, CHARMING BUT DATED","We celebrated my birthday with the Sunday Champagne Brunch and stayed the night in one of the suites. The setting for the brunch was the best part of the ship, the rooms and rest were dated reflecting the age of the ship but the beds were comfortable. The management needs to be more organised i.e. After waiting till after 5pm for our suite, we found out the hard way that our sofa bed was broken so they gave us 2 rollaways which took till 6pm+. The broken sofa was reflected in the system when we reported this to the front desk and should have been rectified long ago, as the maid was not aware when we asked her to make up the sofa bed. Overall, over-priced and a somewhat disappointing stay. The free shuttle by the city to downtown Long Beach was the other highlight !",rodger646
20,The worst place to be,"If you need a depressing day with low class people and pricy too.This is THE place with a costly parking 20usd and attraction for more , keep your money and avoid this attraction to go in downtown long beach to enjoy a SUNNY stroll on the beach of this city",THENAPOLI
20,Queen Mary at Long Beach,"We visited the QM. Nice to see, but not more than that. We only have seen limited places of the QM, i.e. dining rooms, corridors, machine room. Further an exposition of Diana was visited. Great view on the sky line of LA!Overall the price/quality ratio was bad; much too high price.",Ruud S
20,Currently onboard in room M132 what a disappointment!!!!,"As I write this review , I am currently onboard in our room M132. Let's start by saying I am typing this on a iPhone so excuse the fat fingers and grammar it's a monumental effort to type a review on such a small device. Also let me say that I am well travelled as well as my family and never once have I left a review on a travel site but my stay was so disheartening that I feel compelled to keep others from wasting their money. We are here to spend the night 2 adults 2 children ages 2 and 10 and attend the chill park. I feel I am paying Starwoods category five prices for motel six quality.Below Is a outline of our stay.We arrive pull up to valet and are taken to check-in in a fast and friendly manner with luggage in tow. Good job!Front desk staff are happy and inform us about all of the splendor of the good ship Queen Mary. The kind of fake reassurance that signals unpleasant things to come. Our front desk lady tells us that we should upgrade our room to a king since we will have more room and that a roll away bed can be had for 15 dollars. We upgrade the room,sign up for the roll away and proceed to let the fun begin. She also tells us we will need to purchase one more ticket to the chill park since only two are included in the package and the baby is free but 10 year old needs a ticket . No problem we are excited and the kids become even more excite when they take their picture for the VIP pass and print out a credit card type pass. With VIP written on it. Kids think they are special and everyone is happy. But really the VIP pass gets you nothing as we learn later!Next we depart the lobby and head to our room. This is a old ship and I spent years at sea when I was in the Navy so it is neat to see all the sights and sounds. The ship has a noticeable few degree list to the ports side no big deal for a sailor but for those not use to it it could get annoying. We arrive at our room down a rundown hallway (you have to keep in mind the age of the ship but at least they could try and fix it up a little) and enter with the bell boy to stow our stuff. Change into warm cloths and head for the chill park. Because of our hurry to get to the much hyped and highly anticipated park we overlooked checking out the room. More to come on that later.Off we go to chill with high expectations. Only to find out that it is a complete let down. Chill is simply a county fair with ice cubes. A event that can be fully experienced in about three hours and that doesn't warrant VIP passes or a overnight stay on a rundown vessel. The three big draws at chill are the frozen ice room, ice slide , and ice skating. Other then that the kids will get board after a few hours.The ice slide is about 50 foot long and entails standing in line for over a hour to slide down five times. Yep VIP means nothing stand in line get your tube and slide down five times. Thanks for coming and thanks for waiting. The two year old couldn't ride because she was under 45"" and the ten year old said it was pretty lame. Also everything requires a waiver which is cool I get it, but at least if you are willing to sign a waiver there shouldn't be a height requirement. My two year old skis at mammoth and big bear on bunny slopes that are five times the length but yet a 15 foot high 50 foot long ice tube slide is to dangerous to ride with a adult according to the staff. So while I stood in line with the ten year old for a hour mom had to occupy the two year old. Not a lot to do inside the dome orOutside for a two year old. You can only look at gum drops and fake snow for so long when your two.Can't comment on the skating because we couldn't get tickets. Yet again VIP means nothing. But the way the skating works is in time blocks starts every hour for a hour. Yet again a waiver and no admission for the two year old. All the tickets were sold out except for the last session and it was just not worth keeping the kids up until 10 for a hour of skating. So we called it a nightThe frozen room is nothing more then ice sculptures and a ice slide that is about 20 feet long. You get a stinky community parka to wear with broken zippers and even if you are wearing your own still have to wear theirs. Great craftsman ship and a lot detail but with the temperature at 7 degrees you tend to walk fast and look quickly.The rest of the park is food trailers and a jump house. The food that my wife and kids got looked good and they said was awesome but I wasn't hungry at the time so I didn't eat opting to grab something on the ship. Big mistake!!!! Once they finished eating we headed back to the room so the kids could shower and get ready for bed.Back at the room we finally have time to look around . The bathroom is neat but dated , with a saltwater flush toilet that leaks when you flush it. A tub that looks like someone used it to soak car parts in that does not have a stopper and isPatched with epoxy because the enamel is chipped and worn down. Yep I got pictures of that to if your Interested. A real challenge when you need to give a two year old a bath before bed and have to use one of your two allotted washcloths as a stopper. A shower that doesn't work and makes a bird bath look like a spa. I swear you can't make this stuff up and I will produce pictures to prove it. Oh and the best part two towels and two wash cloths for four people.Now onto the bed it is a great big king size bed , but with linen that I would equate to motel six or a homeless shelter. I don't know how comfortable the bed is because as a true gentleman I am sleeping on the roll away so the wife and kids can sleep better. That and the fact that the rollaway is a death trap. More on the roll away later!The tv is a new flat panel lg with basic cable but not the basic cable that is clear, more like the kind of basic cable you would get circa 1980 when it first came out and you would watch it with the snow effect because your mom and dad refused to pay for tv because TV is free. You know the kind with the lines and snow.Moving on to the roll away bed. Something that I think has been onboard since Winston Churchill took one of his five voyages onboard. It started out that the ten year old was going to sleep on it. Until it fell over when he laid on it. It's the kind of bed that forms around you not the memory foam type but the worn down mattress type. Almost navy or prison issue about four inches thick with springs that poke you. So after rescuing the ten year old from the bed . I took one for the team and manned up to sleep on it. The linens are again homeless shelter in nature. To alleviate it from falling apart in the middle of the night I removed the mattress and put it on the floor. Yes that's right I a grown man am sleeping on the floor in a 250 dollar a night hotel room on a four inch thick mattress with springs poking my back. Thanks city of long beach good times , good times.Ok so finally get everyone kid wise settled and decide to order room service dessert. No menu call front desk instead of delivering a menu was told oh we have one at the front desk you can come get it. No problem for front deck , issue for me. So I go get it, and figure it will give me a chance to talk with someone about the quality of the room. I arrive at front desk and am greeted with a ok here you go one room service menu. This place is so low rent that the menu is a 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper triple folded . Then I am told by the front desk oh but if I were you I wouldn't order food it's pretty nasty. I say ok it's for desserts for the kids and I will try and sneak away and eat since I'd didn't eat at the chill park. Then I ask about the quality of room and roll away bed and am told and I quote well sir it's a old ship and you should have booked a better room. After which he takes out a binder with pictures of the rooms and says this is what our other rooms look like. Hey jerk off I am college educated and pretty smart don't show me pictures of rooms taken in 1980 and tell me to book a better room. The total lack of respect goes hand in hand with this , has been rundown scam of a hotel. After being talked to like a toddler for ten minutes I finish the conversation with a thank you I will just dispute the charges with American Express and walk away.So back to the room I go listing to port a few degrees much like everything else at this hotel.I drop off the menu to the wife and tell her I am going to go look for something to eat only order dessert as the front desk guy says food is nasty and head off at 845 to find food.My first stop is the promenade grill. Which leaves me standing in its foyer for ten minutes with no one in sight to seat me. Finally I give up as well as two other guest after waiting ten minutes. I decide to go to one of the other restaurants as I leave finally a hostess shows up and says I can seat you. I said thanks but I will go some place else the other two guest as well made the same decision. It's hard to want to eat at a place that is half empty and ignores you.Next I find myself at the chowder house with the same two other guest and yes ladies and gentleman same thing stand around for ten minutes and finally someone shows up. The lady seats the party of two and returns five minutes later to seat me. A party of one I am seated in the back corner where I am promptly forgotten . Finally as I am starving and ready to leave a waiter shows up and takes my drink order, returns with a coke and some bread and informs me that my waiter will be back to take my order. Are you kidding me. So ten more minutes go by and finally the guy shows up. I ask how the shrimp po boy is he tells me not that good and suggest the crab cake sliders. I ask about the sides he tells me to get the onion rings and I say ok sounds good. Twenty minutes later out pops the crab cake sliders . Have pictures of the most pathetic crab cakes ever conveniently served not on bread but a hot dog bun cut in thirds if you would like that as well. 16 bucks for some soggy crab mush on a hot dog bun with onion rings so nasty that you can't eat them. It was like they fried them let them sit in the window and get cold and them re fried them to heat them back up. So by this point I am hungry and force myself to finish the crab sliders just not to go to bed hungry but couldn't even force myself to eat the onion rings. The waiter comes back to give me a refill for the first time since i sat down. my glass stayed empty for over 30 minutes and I ask do you always serve the crab cakes on a hotdog bun cut in thirds. He says yeah I don't know what happened it use to be on a different bread but not this is what we do. His is nice and offers to get me something else asks about why I didn't eat the onion rings and wants to apologize. I tell him it's not his fault he didn't cook it and he tells me most of the food he serves in his opinion is not that edible. I will give queen Mary one thing at least the employees are honest. It's almost like they feel sorry for the guest. I pay yep I will dispute that too with American Express. And have one more chore to do before I crawl on my mat on the floor and wait for tomorrow to come so we can leave.I have to get a bag we forgot from the car so i make my way down to the valet and on e I arrive hand him my ticket he ask if I will be returning I say I just need the car so I can get a bag out. He walks away and hands me the key. I ask are you going to get the car he points and say it's over there you can get it yourself. Are you yet again kidding me. So I walk to the car to get the bag it's not that far but come on. I return to give the keys back and finally after a ten minute wait someone shows up and takes them.I return to the room where I am greeted by why wife who outlines a room service experience that is lack luster how you screw up ice cream I don't know and crawl on my mat on the floor to type this review.I will say this the ship historically is a neat and interesting item. But staying on her is a joke, just come for the day see the ship and leave don't spend the night. Don't eat here and don't plan a over night visit with the chill park. I would say you could come here and spend a few hours on the ship a few hours at the chill park and then head home and be just as happy an save 300 dollars. Shame on you city of long beach and shame of the hotel operator. This is 2014 and you could at least spend a few dollars making the rooms up to date or better yet keep the crappy rooms and spend the money on teaching your cooks how to cook and employees how to deal with customers. The room can be bad jus call it historically accurate and have great service and food and no one will care. I also would invite the hotel manager to spend a night in room m132 on a mattress on the floor and see how he or she feels about the queen Mary afterwards",Traveller91915
20,Big disappointment.,We arrived after travelling quite a long way. We made our way to ticket booth. Read the many signs for yours and visits to other things. Finally got to front and then was confronted by other options which were not mentioned and a big consideration. Like the tour we wanted was only on in 4 hrs time and at that same time as the other tour. Very confusing. If I have to ask or be told info is not clear. We paid 60 dollars but could not make the tours as they clashed. One tour was slow and very distracting. Repetitive and only tour host was happy. The self tour what a joke. We were directed from the booth to the hotel sent up to 4th floor. To be told to go somewhere else. And back. And back. Wasted time with poor instructions and poor information and staff knowledge. The ticket was loaded with an extra charge but could not advise why I had to pay over the ticket price. A shrug was all I got. Plus playing for tours I didn't use wasn't fair. Hey dinner in cafe would be good right? Poor service. Had to request to order waited over 35 mins. Disappointed and not really recommended. Staff need training signage needs organising and tour needs to flow so much better. Cut the extra expensive useless tours. Open the gift shop when it says it will be open and be more aware that visitors need to be treated better in the cafe.,BerkshireTawny
30,Tours Are Uneven - difficult for handicapped,"We took three tours today. I will describe each - as each was different. We stayed on the ship and had high expectations for the tours which were not met.The Russian submarine is in bad shape. There is a lot of decay on the outside, including holes in the walking surface. I use a cane and both of us are in our 60s and are big. We asked the kid running the show if we should have a problem. He said no and off we went. It was very small and narrow. The water locks between chambers were small and deep. There were four or five of them and were difficult for us to get through. Not enjoyable at all. We have been on other sub attractions. This Is our last. It is not an accessible attraction.We took the Glory Days tour. The guide James was excellent. Very much in tune with his group and made sure everyone was involved. While I personally would have liked more content, he gave a very good tour and was enthusiastic and clearly understandable. He made sure I stayed physically with the group and I appreciated that. I was an architectural society docent in Chicago and know how to give a good tour. James did that.We then took the World War II tour. This guide was very disinterested. He only had about ten people. One person was in a wheelchair and had a slow moving companion. The guide walked very quickly and left the group behind. The information he gave seemed incomplete and in some cases uninformed. For instance, he pointed out a shop that was used as Winston Churchill's office in board. When we asked about the Art Deco mural inside, he said he had not seen it as he didn't go into the shops. The mural is written up in one of the books I bought on the ship. The wheelchair person and two companions got left behind along the way in this 45 minute tour. The guide made the comment that he guessed the wheelchair dropped off, so he could go downstairs. I would skip this tour entirely. Very little information. Awful.Hope this helps someone. We were there January 10.",Bensus
20,A major disappointment,"I bought two of the Royal passports for a friend and I for Christmas and we decided to use them on January 8th 2014. We drove over 100 miles expecting an experience that you really cant get anywhere else. Thinking we were going to get to explore a WW2 era cruise liner and see all of the cool dining halls and staterooms along with the swimming pools and such. We first started with the princess Diana Exhibit which i must say was very interesting and very well laid out and staffed. So i figured if the exhibit is this nice the rest of this experience must be just as great, man was i wrong. The first problem was finding the beginning of the self guided tour, after about 20 minutes of wandering trying to follow the terribly laid out map, we finally asked a worker who seemed more interested in chatting with another worker then helping us. He informed us that we had to exit off of the ship and walk down a long catwalk to the other end of the ship. my question is why would they have the information booth on the 4th floor of the ship and have the self guided tour(what most of the people who visit come to see) on the other side of the ship? Anyway we began the self tour and quickly noticed that about 1/2 of the exhibit lights were shut off. In fact in the hall with the large ship replicas we could barely read the signage it was so dark. The self guided tour was not very easy to figure out and moving from exhibit to exhibit required traveling up and down several stories of the ship as well as exiting and getting back on it. Throughout the whole 4 hours we were touring there was a complete lack of staff, so if i did need any assistance, i would have needed to search for someone. Also there was trash all over the exhibits, whenever we looked over any of the side rails in the engine room or in several other parts of the ship there were piles of current era trash which needed desperately to be cleaned up. Most of the ship is also not exploreable on the self guided tour so our hopes for seeing anything interesting like the pool or dining halls were dashed. Overall i was highly dissapointed with the experience and having to pay 15$ on the way out for parking (when half of the lights were off, there was trash everywhere and there was no staff) was like rubbing salt in the wound.",MaidenArmy
40,Visiting a Distuinguished Old Lady,"The Queen Mary, just the name evokes the glamorous days of the liner era, the glory days of the Second World War and the maritime past of Great BritainThe reality of Queen Mary is just as wonderful, she is still a Grand Old Lady. Well maintained, well run, fun to visit and loaded with history and tradition.There are many spaces open to the public from the engine rooms to the bridge and all of them are interesting. The tours are all excellent and most of them will give you access to areas of the ship that are not generally open to the public.The ship has a number of restaurants and bars open: We had a drink in the wonderful “deco’ bar at the “forrard” end of the ship and finished the day off with dinner at “Sir Winston’s” restaurant which is an experience in itselfII would highly recommend a visit to the Mary, it is well worth it!! Do the tours as well, they really enhance the experience!",Grumley3
20,Disappointed,"We took a self guided tour of the QM, expecting to get an idea of what it would be like to sail on an old luxury cruise liner. But the QM is just a ship... We were not allowed in the hotel area and we're not allowed to see the fancy dining rooms, salons, etc. no idea what the ""hotel"" part of the ship was all about since we were not allowed there either. We thought we would get to see the old fashioned luxury of the big old ship but if those parts of the ship still exist, we were not allowed to see them. It was $50 for the two of us... Way overpriced, when just about at every turn we encountered a sign that read ""private"" or ""no admittance"" or ""hotel guests only."" Also the staff in the MANY gift shops were mostly rude and crabby. I was going to buy a t shirt but after encountering the crappy attitude of the gift shop guy I just walked out. Disappointed.",thebirdguy123
30,"Great piece of history, but extremely overpriced","My family and I enjoyed the ship. It is a great piece of American history that will interest most people, but on top of the overpriced admission, every time you turn a corner there are add-ons that cost another $20, per person. Not much to keep a pre-teen occupied, and not as wheel chair accessible as one would like, especially since the price of admission is no different for even disabled seniors who will see two- thirds of what everyone else will see.",GatorBM
40,Tours give complete historical background and ship exploration,"The Diana exhibit took us 2 hours, as we read many of the displays. The exhibit covers the 20th century history of the royal family. Ghosts and Legends is so-so, but it does get you into areas of the ship off limits to the self guided tour. The Twilight Historical Tour was quite interesting. The self guided tour ranges from the engine room and propeller to the bridge. We were rushed doing it in two hours, as we like to read the material and soak in the experience.",Explorer100
40,A step back in history.,"It was fascinating to visit the Queen Mary. The ship was launched in the 1930s and continued on until the 1960s. We explored the ship and it was an eye-opener to see the difference in technology between the ships of today and the Queen Mary. Everything from navigation to steering to communications. It was like looking back into the stone age.They still operate a hotel on board and a number of restaurants. We did not get a chance to see the hotel, or the rooms. But, we did see several of the restaurants and in fact stopped at one: Chelsea's Chowder House. Try the chowder. Seriously. Try the chowder.......... it's great. Also a nice view of Long Beach.There can be a lot of walking up and down stairways, so be prepared. Also, be prepared to step back in time. Notice the pictures on the wall of celebrities from another era, including Bob Hope, Cary Grant, Loretta Young, to name a few.",Brent P
20,Very disappointed in the visit,"I might preface to say that I had been here for a good visit when it first opened to the public tens of years ago. I thought it was a ripoff. It was very expensive. You have to pay for tours that you don't want. The signage was poor and I kept walking around trying to find things. There were long, long descriptions of what things were, taking so much time to read. I felt sorry for the guys leading the ""haunted tour"" because so many of these areas smelled of mold. It was also very hokey.",SKofIL
50,Fantastic!,"Not only is she a beauty, this ship is full of hidden treasures such as great views, stories of ""haunted"" rooms, and a great destination for a date. The Queen Mary does not disappoint.",Chels98
50,"Beautiful past, great present","Took my family to the Queen Mary in Long Beach, and it was an amazing experience. The ship is in great condition, and the different areas of the ship show you the way life was back then on board. Being a luxury ship, you can see the technology that was used and how 'advanced, the ship was for its time. There are a lot of stores, restaurants, and bars to take a break from the tour, or to take home a souvenir. Also, you can take the guided tour, which is pretty funny because they tell you stories in a humorous way. Very reccomendable.",Jose S
10,Dont waste your money on their New Years Eve Party!!!!!!!,"My husband and I were in town for New Years Eve and bought general admission tickets to the New Years Eve party. That was such a big mistake. First of all when we tried to call and make a dinner reservation (since it wasn't included in the price of the ticket), we got bounced around from person to person and no one could help us. I was even given a phone number to call that was out of service. This establishment does not know what good customer service is. I even walked up to the ship in person and still no one would help me. I was handed a phone and transferred to several other numbers, only to leave a message. By the way, I finally got a call back about 8 hours later (which was way to late). This is only part of the story.When we get to the boat for the party, we find out that the majority of the party rooms were only for VIP guests. There were two venues with live music that we could get into. When we tried to get into a third venue ( which was on the list for general attendees) we were turned away and told not until 10 pm. Also the seating in the venues was for VIPs only which meant that there was no place to sit all night. We finally got fed up and left and on the way out talked to two employees, one of which was a manager. The manager actually had the nerve to insinuate that we were not being truthful with our complaint. When I purchased the tickets, nowhere did it say that we would not be able to sit in the venues or that the majority of the party rooms would be VIP. So thanks a lot for nothing Queen Mary. $200 down the drain!!!!",Brenda K
40,LOVE CHILL SECOND YEAR !,"Second year for Chill in as many years and boy has it been improved. Love the event. Went on the first weekend it was open in November and loved all the improvements. The exterior has added many new things to see and do, and is so much nicer than the first year it was open can't wait to see what it is like next year. Last year stayed on the boat the night before which was nice and thinking will do in alternate years. However, that being said the 20 bucks charged for parking when not staying is outrageous given how much money we already paid for tickets not to mention souvenirs and food at Chill. The food i might add was a bit disappointing had a huge hot dog we split and the cost was high for a cold dog and fries with an over priced drink. I know i should expect these things. That being said the actual event, was set up so nice i really felt like i'd entered a winter wonderland, and love the actual Chill ice sculptures, it's so awesome turned around and walked through twice as we did last year as well. Thank you for Chill, it's much better than a similar event which actually takes place at a resort in the east. But rethink the parking fee, maybe include it in the ticket price i dunno but it was a shock to dish out the 20 bucks when leaving.",northernk
30,Was expecting more,"The ship was impressive but was almost drarwfed by one of Cuniards liners berthed next to it. We tkk the $28 dollar tour and really didnt feel like we got our moneys worth. The guide was a tad corny for my taste butthe rest of the group seemed to like him. Biggest thing noticed is that the QM needs some face lfting. The frayed carpets could trip smeone very easily. One of the bar crew dropped a whole pail of ice and just walked off.Would probably suggest doing your own walking tour but not sure whihc areas are off limits like the ballroom.Again, it was OK but i guess i was expecting theTtitanic luxury which wasn't there.",Michael B
50,Family Fun at Queen Mary's Chill,"We recently spent a day at the Queen Mary's Chill with the kids and we all had a blast. First off is the holiday themed village which is the center of the event area. It is lined with massive candy canes, lollipops, gingerbread men and much more. The village has a huge snowman jumper which the kids were in for a good 30 minutes. There is a gingerbread house for decorating your own house, a huge rocking horse for you to climb in and a snow globe ""jumper"" with fake snow. The star of the Chill village is the outdoor ice skating rink which the Queen Mary hovers over and provides a beautiful background.As you head into the igloo to the right there is ice tubing at their six lane Glacier Glide hill. The kids really loved speeding down the icy slope. On the left is the most impressive part of the entire Chill event. The Ice Kingdom is 2 million pounds of ice that is hand sculpted into an impressive Nutcracker themed winter wonderland. There are slides as well at the top of the two story Queen Mary ice sculpture. You are given a parka to help you stay warm while in the chilly 9 degree weather. Overall, the Queen Mary Chill event was a lot of family fun and the activities will have you and the kids entertained for the whole day.",Family Vacation Hub
30,"Staying the night lets one tour at lesiure, but ...","First of all, it is an amazing ship. We enjoyed the self guided tour, at our own pace, without being herded from point to point. It was also nice to go back to favorite places. One night was all that we could stand, however.We were there in late December, and the room was so hot. We had the port holes open, and the pipes that are supposed to blow sea air, or heated air set to cool. The room was still hot. To make things worse, there is a fan on the wall, with a sign saying that it is an original wall fan, and is non operational.When we flushed the toilet, the pipes leaked. There was no hot water for the shower.While it was an interesting experience, it was pricey for the condition of the room. We did it once, but will not do it again.",Ikimashoka
40,Touring point,"Great touring destination for visitors and for locals who haven't seen the ship yet.We had fun with the tour But we enjoyed even more at the submarine. Maybe because we were all out of shape and the tour route is a little challenging.Then again, it's worth the visit.",Bornok_30
40,Paranormal Ship Walk,"We took a two hour haunted ship tour of the Queen Mary that started at 8PM on a weeknight. It started with a history lesson of the QM which is important to know how the ship could have all these tales of ghost sightings and paranormal activity. The three interesting stops on the tour for me were: (1) The boiler room where a young man named John lost his life in the 1960's and where we witnessed paranormal activity that evening, (2) The first class swimming pool with the false rumor that a young girl drowned in the pool. (This pool is incorporated in one of the ""Dark Harbor's"" Halloween maze with a ""young girl"" asking for her dolly.), (3) The bow (front of the ship) where the QM crashed into the escort ship ""Curaçao"" during WWII and hundreds of soldiers on the Curacao lost their lives. It was debatable per our tour guide if we did witness paranormal activity in that area. There were a mix of believers and semi-believers on the tour but we were all respective of the energy around us. It was a treat to be able to go to locations on the QM that are not open to the daytime tours . It was a beautiful and clear evening on the magnificent Queen Mary with her three smokestacks brightly lite for the holidays. We could see the outdoor ice skating ring that is part of ""Chill."" I had been here during the day and I always enjoy myself aboard the QM. In my opinion, she maybe old but she is still regal.",CaliLAgirl
40,Great venue - but eat elsewhere.,"I thought the Queen Mary itself was an excellent venue....an old cruise ship, maintained a lot how it was when it sailed the sees, was excellent. With the different and restored decks, and the history placards throughout the ship, the experience of the ship itself was great.The dinner / restuarant experience on board, though was forgettable. Atlhough not truly ""bad"", the food at the place we ended up at was expensive, not very varied, and relatively small portion sizes...along with a poor beer selection to boot.I would love to spend more time on board covering every inch of the old ship, but I would certainly eat elsewhere.",Matt S
50,The way we were....,"A wonderful glimpse of the bygone age of luxury sea travel (as opposed to cruising) and how the pre-WW2 glitterati lived. Our guided tour was excellent (conducted by 'The Captain') and for lovers of decor and woodwork this is surely a 'must see' experience. Good views, cafes and gift shops with 'branded' souvenirs round off the experience. Well worth a visit.",David-Skipper
40,Worth a visit,we went there for a a team together and we enjoyed the museum and the restaurant there. It was really awesome and we could see the panoromic view of long beach and the museum was fascinating.Its really worth he visit!,Muruz
50,Back to stay on board after a 9 year absence...some changes good some not so good...,"I just got back from a 6 night stay on board, after a 9 year absence. Wow how things have changed! Got to the ship on Saturday night, November 16th, and the hotel was completely sold out. Hundreds of high school kids were staying as part of a three night convention, so there were roving bands of teenagers all over the ship. Needless to say this prevented me from sleeping until after 1am when they finally began to return to their cabins!!The hotel plays canned jazz in the lounge areas on Main and A Deck, and this is OK because I like the jazz they play. Since my cabin (M007) was next to the lounge area outside of the Travel Bureau I could hear it but fortunately it was turned off by 10pm. I do like the addition of furniture in the Main Deck lounge area in front of the Travel Bureau (though it is ugly cheap furniture but better than the huge empty space that was there before), and I like the plexiglass that allows people to view the Travel Bureau without going in and vandalizing it. The current operator seems to be putting a lot of effort in to the hotel operation, but very little effort is being put in to the displays and exhibits. The engine room has numerous light bulbs that are out, creating a dim experience down there. The starting platform, usually well lit, was very dim due to lights that were out. Also the new displays forward of the propeller exhibit are so dark!! I think they are using the ghost/haunted ship excuse to leave the lights down. The displays also seem hastily put together, with many items missing any kind of explanation as to what they are.I miss the forward B Deck area displays, I guess they were taken out years ago, but they were full of interesting items. I hope they were all put back in to safe storage.The ships horn sounded good and was on time. On Thursday night, the skating rink was opened (called ""Chill"") and they sounded the horn at 7:30pm (which is not a normally scheduled time for the horn to sound) I imagine as a way to announce it was open. I love the sound of the Queen Mary’s horn echoing off in to the distance in Long Beach. I imagine that this is a sound that the citizens living within earshot hear and feel good about. It is a sound I hope will never fade away in the future.The Observation Bar is much improved with the original red having been returned to the torchiere lamps and the ceiling accent is good too. The door to the room behind the bar is restored and in use, this is very good!! Happy Hour half price beer on tap and the cheese plate is highly recommended (the Alesmith IPA is superb). The big band era jazz they play during Happy Hour is wonderful too, a very fitting background while enjoying a pint of beer in this most gorgeous room. Service was mostly good, though one young woman was a little slow, but she was just there on Sunday and Tuesday night. Everyone I encountered who worked on the ship, from the Prom Café, to the Observation Bar, to the hotel desks and the shops, were all very friendly and seemed very happy to be working on board. But this is nothing new. One shopkeeper, who said she had been working on the Queen Mary for more than 25 years, remarked to me that “The Queen keeps the people she likes.”The Diana exhibit is incredible, for those interested in the Royal Family. I went expecting a lame display of dresses, but it covers the entire Windsor family and in great detail. Need at least one hour to see it.The Starbucks-like cafe is a nice addition, I was able to have a cheap breakfast there every morning instead of having to eat at the Prom Cafe. The Prom Cafe has a limited menu compared to 2004, but the food and service at dinner were good. But with only 3-4 tables of people eating dinner there at 7pm, I don't know how they can stay open or even break even. I didn't try the Chelsea as it was too expensive for my budget but I am sure it was busier. They routinely closed the Prom Cafe early, just after 7pm, due to lack of customers, and I saw them turn away a few people too, which is a bizarre business model.The cabins are in good shape, very clean, and the beds are comfortable, the water pressure remains amazing (I wish my bathroom had a long bathtub like this one!!!), but the room temperature control remains an issue. I was cold in my first cabin on M Deck, with no warm air coming from the punkah louvres even though I did rotate them to that setting. And my second cabin on A Deck was too warm, but I was able to leave the portholes open to mitigate that issue. When I made a request with the front desk to increase the cool air coming in to my cabin, I don't think anything was done as no cool air was available the next morning.They make it almost impossible to find the Engine Room/Queen Mary Story exhibit, without the escalator you have to get off at R Deck and go up the stairs, then over and down the stairs again to get there. Very weird! It was so much easier in 2004 when you could cruise down the escalator from A Deck. Why was this removed??? I did see many people with the audio tour headsets on, and this is a new feature that is a very welcome sight.The escalators in the engine room exhibit, after 9 years, are still broken and not running. Walking up an escalator that is not moving is an awkward experience. Also the dim lighting in the engine room exhibit has to deter some visitors entirely. The poster describing the boilers (“Incredible Maze Of Massive Boilers”) in the forward A Deck exhibit is superb. Rather than being hidden away in this area, it should be front and center on Prom Deck, used as part of an invitation to all to come see the engine room exhibit. It should also be sold as a poster in the shops (say for about $20). I'd buy one and frame it for my home! It too was very poorly lit, and deserves to be up in the engine room area reproduced in a larger size. Also, the excellent prom deck lifeboat stanchion model added to the engine room exhibit in 2003 is nowhere to be seen, I found it in a storage area near the stern gallery. The theater that used to play the Queen Mary Story is now closed off to the public completely. Why?? The outside of the ship is a shambles. The paint is peeling off in huge chunks. Also the new carpeting that was laid in 2003-2004 is now frayed and in need of replacement. Why not just remove it all and restore the original flooring underneath? Would be much cheaper to polish it once a week than to replace 3 decks of carpeting every 10 years. I found the small areas of flooring on aft B Deck interesting, though it is green and white, which I do not believe was on the ship while she was in service.The chart room aft of the bridge was closed off to the public, with the doors locked. This was open in 2004. I heard it might be related to a water leak.The First Class Lounge on Prom Deck was shut, dark, and locked for the entire time I was on the ship, though I did see a man in ships officer uniform open it for two people on a private tour. I understand a lot of refurbishment was done to this room and I was eager to go in and see it, but was unable to. This was a major disappointment as this room is the most beautiful room on the entire ship, and deserves to be shown to the public, at least as part of the behind the scenes tour.I did not go to Sunday Brunch as it was out of my budget, but it seemed busy when I peeked inside the dining room, which has new carpeting as well as the entire R Deck entrance area.I did not go on the Ghosts and Legends tour as I know I'd be irritated by it to no end, so I was not able to see the First Class Pool area at all, though there was a tour guide inside after hours talking with someone. I felt like knocking on the door and asking to come in, but I didn't.The Guided Tour seems to be a joke, with no access to any off-limits area, why pay for it?? In 1996 this tour included a First Class Suite on Main Deck, part of the original Working Alleyway on C Deck (one deck below R Deck) as well as the First Class Pool.I was able to get in to the First Class Smoking Room one evening and took some photos. It too is an amazingly beautiful room worth showing on a tour. But the Third Class lounges on forward B Deck were all locked up tight, so was the port side of the former Third Class Dining Room, now a storage area. The Verandah Grill was also closed and locked up. The current operator needs to remember that it isn't just about ghosts, it's about history and preservation.Since 1971 the Queen Mary has been a jewel in the crown of the City of Long Beach. She has spurned tremendous economic development downtown and has enchanted countless visitors over the years since then, including myself, who visited her for the first time as a boy with my family in 1978.I returned to visit the Queen Mary in 1996, and stayed one night in an M Deck original First Class cabin. During my short visit I had a tripod and I took a few rolls of slide film in and around the ship. I was so inspired by the overwhelming beauty of the Queen Mary, that I put together a website the following year to make an effort to help promote and celebrate this amazing wonder of the maritime world, of which she is the sole survivor from an era long since relegated to the history books (for those who are interested, it can be found at http://www.hull534.com).Since 1971 the Queen Mary has done nothing but give. She first gave away her massive boilers, her turbo generating equipment, and one of her two engine rooms, for scrap value (most of it for a mere $20 per ton). To the City of Long Beach she has given her heart and soul. To her millions of visitors and hotel guests and convention attendees, she has provided shelter, entertainment, and a beautiful wood paneled cabin for the night. Now, more than ever before, is high time for all of us to begin to give back to the Queen Mary. She is in desperate need for long deferred maintenance all over the ship. She is an octogenarian, and deserves to be taken care of just as we take care of our senior citizens of the same age. Water leaks are rampant. One leak went down 4 decks to the little shop near the hotel desk, and landed right on their credit card machine, which meant they were not able to accept credit cards. Where is the office where one can sign up to be a volunteer? If I lived locally to Long Beach, I would be down there every weekend working as a volunteer, to try and make a positive difference in her survival.",hull534
50,A view of the past,We enjoyed a 'ghost' tour of the ship before doing a 'self tour'. I don't usually enjoy such 'ghost' tours but this was a delight!! Well done. It provides a 'look' into the past and well worth seeing. The ship is also an hotel with guest enjoying original cabins.We also enjoyed afternoon tea on the ship. The quality of the food was excellent and plentiful.,Jill-Jack
30,My 2 night stay was OK,"My company worked out a last minute deal for business meetings/hotel stay on the ship. My room was just ""ok"" - kind of old furnishing, very small and not one of the upgraded rooms like my co-workers had. The bathroom was very small - no place to put much of anything. My room was B117. I can say the room was very clean which is always a plus and the bed was very comfortable. I did enjoy staying on the ship and all the surroundings the QM had to offer. I didn't get a chance to take any tours but did eat on the ship. Food was very good. And I appreciated the Starbucks on the ship ++. As far as my stay, I saw or felt no ghosts.",Andrea
40,Fun!,"We went in October so the Haunted Ship show was the main attraction. Was more elaborate than I would have thought, though not so convincing and scary that a five-year old couldn't get through it. Was nice the see a bit of the inner workings of the ship, even if it was dark and haunted. :)All in all was quite fun and we're planning to return for the December Winter/Snow show.",USC_Mare
50,Don't miss this while in Long Beach.,Always wanted to see this attraction and finally did this trip and wasn't disappointed at all. Be sure to take all the tours as that will really enhance your visit. Plan at least 4 hours to see it all.,lvtotrvl20
50,Beautiful experience,"This is an authentic old ship experience. You can take a ghost tour, a regular tour, stay at an onboard hotel, eat at fantastic onboard restaurants, visit the bar on the top deck....they have festivals (like the Scottish festival in February) all year round. So worth the experience.",Ilovellamas
50,Spooky,"The tour to this trip was spooky and enjoyable at the same time, my favourite part was the pool. It's interesting to go around the ship and see all the places. It looks old and I can only imagine how would it look without the care it has. All in all was nice and fun, fortunately nothing creepy or scary happened to me.",Gaby C
20,My mom made me go!,My mom had stayed on the Queen Mary over 20 years ago and was adamant that we stop on our trip up the coast. So we did! We took the ghost tour. It was $24.95 per person and it was the cheesiest tour I've ever been on. Way too expensive but she paid or I would have regretted the entire experience. After the goofy tour we walked around. I enjoyed seeing different parts of the ship and the history around it. There was an incredible sunset that evening and my mom left happy so overall it was worth it just for that reason. Parking is expensive too. It was $15 dollars and we were only there for about 2 hours. I would not do this again nor recommend it if you are not in the area purposefully.,MJBobb
10,Expensive dissapointment,"Unless you have a particular interest in this ship do not go. $15 for three hours parking, $25 entrance plus a $1.75 service charge per person. All this too see a few empty rooms with no directions or any order to viewing the rooms. A few pictures no actual cabins just a mock up of cabins and some of the engine rooms.My wife and I were going to stay aboard for a couple of nights so glad we didnt.Seriously save your money.",kilroyred
50,Ice chill at the Queen Mary a magical experience!!!!,"Last night our family went to long beach had a beautiful walk around the Queen Mary and then a yummy dinner on the boat.We then walked over to the Big Chill Winter Wonderland and nothing could have prepared us for the magical land we entered.The kids went ice skating, ice tubing and on the hour it snowed!!!!They had a photo with Santa and I mean a real Santa !! Our little one said I think that was him mum!!!We then went thru the ice chill. The nutcracker story carved in ice as well as a replica of the Boat.. With big winter jackets on it is unbelievable !!Lastly sitting in the snow we sat around fire pits having hot chocolates and sweets it really feels a lot like Christmas!!!This was a night that would be hard to top from the bucking reindeer to the 40 foot snowman jumping castle thank you or making our family Christmasmemories!!",Melissa D
50,Relive the Splendor,"Imagine its 1939. Imagine you are crossing the Atlantic. Imagine you are aboard one of the finest liners of all times- then stop imagining. You are on board! Very few majestic liners have survived. The Normandie burned at the pier. The Queen Mary burned in Hong Kong harbor. The France was scrapped and the SS United States lies rusting away in Philadelphia's harbor. The Queen Mary offers a unique way to sample the majesty of this fine ship. She has been fairly well preserved and much of the ship is accessible.As you walk around, read the signs (or listen to the audio tour) and you can almost feel the vibrations of the engines.When my wife and I visited there was a special exhibit on the life of Princess Diana which we did not view. I believe these exhibits rotate. We did do the ""ghost tour"" which, although hokey for sure, does allow you to see the massive boilers which were needed to propel this grand ship at break-neck speeds.The Queen is a part of maritime history and well worth the visit.",LADWhitePlains
40,Q.M. Showing Age...,"I love visiting the Queen Mary, I wish it was closer to where I lived though. Upon boarding, my Uncle flashed a business card of some other restaurant, I thought the QM is an attraction, not just a hotel. Huh? We were able to get on, so I guess it didn't matter.It was a nice day walking around and had a yummy pina colada in the back of the ship. I believe this is the best spot to relax and look at the views while enjoying a beverage. Felt dismayed there is now a Starbucks as I do not like them. But I really like the old paneling and old photographs displayed in various parts of the ship. However, it made me excited for my upcoming Caribbean cruise as I really enjoying cruising.We also saw The Chill down below next door and it looked kind of lame, more for kids it seemed. Didn't see that much of space and overpriced. I guess if you have kids then it would be nice, but otherwise I would not bother.",Linnea P
40,Fun times,"My family (13 of us) all went to the Ice Village display ( ""CHILL"" ) next door to the Queen Mary. After seeing the display, we went to visit the Queen Mary, and have lunch. I had been to the Queen Mary and the restaurant many times, so thought I would bring my family to experience it.We all loved walking around and seeing all the interesting things. We have never stayed in the Queen Mary hotel, but are now planning to.",Nanski
40,It's the CHILL adventure,"Queen Mary in Long Beach has an ice adventure that you will love! An outdoor ice rink and a six lane ICE slide! Just llike a water slide but it's all made of ice! They give you giant blue parkas to slip on over your clothes, you sit down and slide! Soooo much fun! Lots of food booths and christmas shops too!",Hawaiigirl9
40,Colder than ice,"Went to the queen Mary for the ice event. Ice skating, hot cocoa, and sub-zero temperatures that keep outstanding ice sculptures frozen in time.A def must during the holidays!! Fun for all ages!! They provide big warm jackets that you WILL need so don't act like a hot shot. It is truly below zero!!! Fun!!!",HedyvonRibbonTroff
40,Historical Elegance,We took our grown children on a tour of the ship and they enjoyed it very much.We could see the ice skating rink and Christmas decorations of Chill right next door.This is quite a site as there is a giant rocking horse and snowman.What a beautiful time of year to see the city lights and Chill.We had dinner at Sir Winstons and that is another review.Take a walk back in time and see what it was like.,PeggyChism
30,A lovely old lady but . . .,"This ex-mariner always enjoys looking around old ships, ships that were built in the days of elegance. The QM is a classic example of such a vessel, built to carry thousands back and forth across the Atlantic in the days before air travel became the cheap option. The only sad thing is that she is looking rather long in the tooth these days and could really do with some TLC. Please take note Long Beach!",Taran H
50,Wonderful Place to see the Past....,"To see how people travelled many many years ago by boat was incredible. We went to Observation Bar to have drinks, appetizers and look out at the Long Beach waterfront. View is amazing, and the ship is REALLY cool to see.",BradleyandMia
40,The grand dame of historic cruising,"The Queen Mary is an icon that has a unique space in the history of cruising. She was an elegant ship that royalty, movie stars and the world's rich and famous cruised on in her day. Then she spent part of World War II ferrying soldiers to and from the front. She has a fascinating history. She remains a beautiful ship and an interesting place to spend an afternoon. The wood decks, the Observation Bar and the gorgeous dining room are wonderful to see and the visit to the crew quarters is well worth a visit.",TrinaSchoon
50,Cool Art Deco Ship,"Best to visit a festival there like Ink N Iron, if you're into that. It also offers a tea service, which I've always wanted to attend. The views from the restaurants are great.",TracyCaldeira
40,Queen Mary SoCal Icon,When you come to southern California visiting the Queen Mary is a must on your list of places to visit! There are tons of gift shops and my only caveat about the QM is that you need to wear comfty shoes..no exceptions!,2Lima
40,Defo worth a visit,"To really appreciate the masterful luxurious liner that was The QM. Brilliant piece of engineering for her time and lots of history and nice gift shops (and some just weird)! Good bar, Starbucks and observation deck.An asset to Long beach, see if if you can!",worldtravellerplus77
50,Great Experience,"Great hotel exprience, excellent food, great tours. Great Sunday Brunch in ballroom with excellent and many food selection to satisfy everyone. Somewhat pricey but worth it. Spent two days on ship for an anniversary weekend",Mike M
40,Eat your Wheaties....,"I can't imagine the elite people who strolled the same decks as we did on our visit to the QM. This is a must see when in Long Beach and if you like, you can actually stay on the ship at the hotel within. This marks my second trip to the Queen and it was as fun as the last one. This is a very big ship and there are several tours available but the self guided walking tour will get you around just fine, there is a lot of walking, stairs and decks to choose from. Make sure to eat your Wheaties and do some calisthenics before going, it's a danged big ship. For the skittish ones, this ship can be pretty creepy, especially in the aft section where the infirmary was, I only made it halfway down the steps and had the hair on my neck stand straight out. Needless to say, I was out as well, out the door that is. I am not skittish either but given the amount of people who probably died in that room, it was definitely weird.We went on a combo ticket that we purchased at the aquarium of the pacific and rode the free shuttle over to the QM. there is a submarine on site for those interested in that sort of thing but it is a separate charge. Have a drink in the lounge, sit on and stroll the decks and stand in the wheelhouse, it is an amazing feat of it's time. There are a lot of stairs, tight spots and I did not see any elevators so those with wheelchairs, which I saw nobody in one, may have a difficult time getting around. Check beforehand on that, I could be quite wrong.When we went, there was hardly anyone there, however it is really big so there is plenty of room for all.",David M
50,parking tips and combined USS Iowa tickets,"We did the combined Queen Mary/Battleship Iowa ticket. It was a very good value at $30, although I was very annoyed at having to pay a $1.75 per ticket ""service"" fee. Why don't they just include this in the ticket price?!!! Anyway, you can use the tickets over a two day period so you don't have to rush your visits.Parking at the Queen Mary is a rip-off! You can save $12 by parking at the city's 3rd street lot ($5 all day) then walk two blocks to Pine St and hop on the free Passport bus for a scenic 10-minute ride to the ship and back again when you're done.At the Iowa you can park for free on the street one block west of Harbor St and walk to the Iowa in three minutes. The Iowa tour is very well done, but since you're limited as to where you can go on the ship you only need about two hours to do the tour. That includes reading all the signs and watching the videos.",scottminer53
30,It's a Big Boat,"The best part about this attraction is the many gift shops. First, the basic self-guided tour is pretty boring. I had a choice of also getting the ghost tour or the USSR Submarine tour with my basic admission. I opted for the ghost tour and it was as corny as it sounds. Dining options were varied, but I didn't eat at any. My biggest complaint is that everything costs extra. I didn't see the Diana exhibit because of the additional cost. I imagine, had I paid to see it, I would have been disappointed as well. To me, this is your typical tourist trap. I recommend that you avoid it. There are many more things to see and do in Long Beach.",sactokaren
40,Lots of walking,"Anyone who has been on a cruise knows how much walking is required on a cruise ship. The Queen Mary is no exception, up and down stairs and long decks will quickly wear you out. The ghosts and legends tour shows of the ship not accessible except for the tour including the indoor pool and boiler room. I highly recommend it. The engine room tour is another nice area but be prepared to walk.",timeoffagain
50,Th Queen's Chicken Wings,"Cant' even remember the name, but they were like buffalo wings, but with a slightly sweet taste and crispy. They were soooooooo good...and...filling! Was late for the Ghost tour chomping on the wings :)",Wannabablessing
30,"Interesting historical place, some improvement needed!","I stayed here for a night on a recent stop over in LA, I was with my husband on our honeymoon. We were greeted by very friendly check in staff. I wish the facility fee had been better explained to us, we were very confused about whether Internet was included or not.We had cocktails in the bar, cocktails were great, but staff were very slow clearing away drinks from the previous customers at our table. Very attractive Art Deco style bar.We had dinner in the promenade cafe, great service and quite nice food. We loved the chocolate brownie sundae for dessert. I tried a flat bread pizza, very nice.We also had breakfast at the same place, found it a bit average. My poached egg was delivered swimming in too much water, and the hash brown was a bit average. We also were not able to order a latte with breakfast, only American coffee ( we are from overseas and like the option of a stronger coffee).We found the room at the hotel to be quite clean and comfortable. Beware the threshold step entering the bathroom - very easy to trip on, could do with a contrasting colour to make it more obvious. We had an issue with the TV- colour not working properly, could only view in black and white. Also the hot water in the shower is an issue. We were able to have a shower at night after waiting for ages for hot water to come through, but no hot water in the morning despite waiting for abut 10 minutes, so no morning shower for us, as I wasn't keen on a cold shower. So much for the 'help us conserve water' signs everywhere. We were only here for 1 night and about to checkout, so wasn't worth complaining about at the time. But this is a basic, you should be able to have a hot shower when you want to.We enjoyed looking around the ship, the self guided audio tour was informative, but we did find it very hard to find some locations, especially the engine room. Exhibits are good, but could do with updating.It was fun to visit the Queen Mary for the historical aspect and novelty of being on an old ship, not sure I'd stay in the accommodation again, especially given the lack of hot water to shower.",Moolyaus
40,A good experience on a piece of history,"I visitied it and had a wonderful experience. These decks... this bar... even the Russian submarine. I like it very much. Is somehow expensive (see that on Mondays is cheaper) if you pay the parking... but if you go to Long Beach, you must go.",FabianLupidi
40,Toilets at car park,"Forst off as we were staying the night we couldn't find where we should park ! I needed the loo, by the ticker office two disgusting portoloos. We got tickets for ghost tour but didn't realise we would be on a scary tour in the engine rooms, the tours not explained very well, but we did enjoy it. Then we booked in the hotel reception, staff helpful and friendly, we didn't move the car as the hotel one was full then, but it was ok, our cabin was original with modern things added great fun, we loved it, we cruise so great to compare! A last stop in USA was a finishing touch before returning to UK.",georgiegirl1_11
10,Don't Waste Your Money or Your Time,"When I was young, I remember visiting the Queen Mary is total amazement. It was grand and spectacular. So when my son had a day off of school, we purchased online tickets to the Diana Exhibit ($85 for three & $15 for parking), we grabbed Grandma (87 years old) and headed north to Long Beach. I should have realized as we got closer and the black of the ship was faded and gray, that something wasn't quite right. As we got closer a sign directed us to park in what appeared to be a storage area for the recent Halloween Event. We manuvered around looking for handicap parking...nothing. With no direction as to where the entrance was, we wandered around some more. Finally, we found the hotel entrance, showed our tickets and were told to go directly to the Diana Exhibit...we figured there would be a map directing us... nope, nothing. After additional wandering, we figured out what level we needed to be on. Grandma enjoyed the news articles about the older Royals but that was about it. Nothing more than china and minature dolls with ""like"" dresses. Once we left there, it was time for lunch...two restaraunts one of which was a Starbucks. Time for the 'self guided tour'...no map. After wandering some more, we finally found a diagram of the ship. We wanted to see the engine room. The ticket girl directed us thru a construction site..go thru two red british phone booths. The day was a disappointment, waste of money. Will never recommend to anyone! You have my money and I have a bad memory!!!",Michelle M
30,Once is enough,"My second time on board and there is nothing remarkable about the experience. The tour is perfunctory and the food and service are okay, but our event was something of a yawn. If you've never been on an ocean liner, you may find this to be of interest. If you have, it is unlikely you'll find anything memorable.",anasoll
40,Great tour - great history,"Okay, I didn't see any ghosts and though you can now spend the night on the ship, I did not do that either, but I loved the history and I loved the tour. Would definitely recommend it.",c685710
20,Sad to say: a waste,"The advertisement of a collection of Princess Diana's clothing as well as other royalty memorabilia on display in the ship convinced me that paying over $30 per person was worth visiting the Queen Mary. What a disappointment! A few pieces of clothing, not the glamorous ensembles I hoped to see, were on display along with old letters,some china, stupid tourist stuff on which bad likenesses of royal family members are plastered, and news articles made up the exhibit. We were free to roam the bow and stern, and other outside areas but we were not allowed to see or walk into any rooms at all. I was admonished when I sneaked a peek of a ballroom (the door was open) by some unofficial looking woman. What a waste of our hard earned money.",Kathy N
30,"Interesting ship, awful ghost tour","We visited the Queen Mary with some local friends and were very disappointed. First of all it was very expensive and poorly set up to buy the ticket package. The ship is run down and needs repairs, I'm sure at one time this was magnificent, but not now. The only thing I can say about the ghost tour is it needs a ton of help and is a waste of time. You get to walk around after the tour and some of the ship is nice. Between the high cost to come aboard and all the stores trying to sell you stuff I would not recommend this to anyone.",Richard A
10,From Friendly to Greedy,"I live in Long Beach and used to love going on the Queen Mary for an afternoon. We were not charged for going on the ship. It's now almost $50 for two people to just go on the ship and look around. The woman in the ticket booth was rude and annoyed with our questions. The food and drinks are expensive enough. They will get their money when people are on the ship and want to enjoy the history of such an amazing ship. They now have new owners and are charging for basic entry from zero to $26! If they needed additional money for the upkeep, I can understand that. The bathrooms were always filthy and the ship was in need of an overhaul. $10 to just walk around the ship is reasonable. I was extremely disappointed because it's not the best attraction in the city but at least you could spend $50 on lunch and a drink on deck. Apparently they have also converted the ship into a mini-mall and blocked off many of the rooms that you could tour through as you explored the ship. My nephew and I enjoyed the aquarium instead.",Lora R
50,Luxury Champagne Brunch,"If you're visiting Long Beach, don't miss the Sunday Champagne Brunch. The range of food is insane (traditional breakfast, roasts, Chinese and Japanese, Italian, a seafood station, cakes and sweets and artisan cheeses) and the service is very good. Enjoy the experience of being on the genuine Queen Mary, in the Grand Salon.",Sally P
40,A fascinating ship but do the historical tour too,"I arrived a little late and only had a little over 2 hours to do the Russian Submarine ( well worth a look) and the Queen Mary. Four hours would be a more relaxed amount of time. I bought a First Class pass, about $30 which included everything. The ship is very impressive from the outside, vaguely reminiscent of the Titanic in the movie. I did the self guided audio tour rather quickly but got though most if it. I had booked in to the guided historical tour as well. The tour guide, James, was dressed in the uniform of one of the ships officers. He is very knowledgable about the ship and quite entertaining. I felt this was the highlight of the visit. Afterwards I had a drink in the Art Deco Observation lounge at sunset, which is very atmospheric. We also got to see a couple of the hotel rooms. They are very much like they were in the ship's heyday, with a few mod cons like flat screen tv's etc. added. it would be quite an interesting alternative to a traditional hotel to stay there.",dave w
40,A grand old lady but sadly in need repair,Well sign posted from Long Beach area with lots of parking. A truly majestic vessel and its easy to see the the grandeur of how some will have travelled in her hey day. It's sad to see some of the decay now evident and some areas such as the engine rooms/first class swimming pool have been taken over by a ghost tour. It would have been interesting to see these areas as they had been when the QM plied the north Atlantic. An interesting visit that could have been so much more. I would still recommend the visit if in the area.,UKtraveller055
40,"Interesting ship, weird ghost tour","My husband, daughter and I took some time on the Queen Mary using our Go LA card. When we got there, we spent some time on the self-guided tour, easily done. We checked out the engine room, the displays of rooms for the different classes, and some of the famous folks that stayed on the ship. I really enjoyed the touching stories from folks that had experiences with the Queen Mary themselves or through their relatives, I got teary! We went on the ""Ghosts and Legends"" tour, since my daughter is a big ghost story fan. It started out good, got a little cheesy, and ended abruptly with no explanation. We were ushered through a side door to the outside of the ship and told to go back in through the entrance....What?!?! Before we went on the tour, our picture was taken and we were told the photo would be ready when we returned from the tour, to that spot. Well, that didn't happen. After that, we checked out some more rooms on the ship, infirmary, etc and some of the shops. Nice ship, good self tour, but don't do ""Ghosts and Legends"", weird. $15 to park, really? That's Universal Studios pricing.",dme3
50,A romantic night out - Observation Deck,"If you live in or are visiting the area, you should take one of your slow Saturdays to get all dolled up and enjoy a night out at the Observation Deck bar on the Queen Mary. You pay a fee downstairs before going in, but it's a ""food voucher"" toward whatever you buy on the ship. This is a ""special night out"" kind of thing. $40 plus pp. They have live music on weekends, and the ambiance is wonderful. A great place to let yourself relax.",FunintheOCsun
30,"Great History, But Be Prepared to Be Shut Out","The ship is a historic monument to days gone by. It's really cool to see how transatlantic travel used to be done back in the day. I really geek-out on this historical stuff. But I was disappointed that some of the most interesting spaces were blocked off due to corporate functions and meetings. Also, it's a shame that the wood decks are no longer stained and shiny.I visited when there was a Princess Diana exhibit on board. It was the reason for the visit. What a disappointment that was. It was advertised to be a great display of the Princess' gowns and personal effects, but 98% of the displays were kitschy memorabilia. You know the commemorative plates and tea cups that are sold in gift shops and on television in the UK? Yeah, that's all it was. Very disappointing.I also had tea on board, and that was stupendous. The tea itself was superb and the treats were just as delicious.",JMichaelz02
30,Great history but pricey,"I visited this ship years ago, and it's still cool, but they nickel and dime you every time you turn around. Just to park is $15, which they fail to mention. I went to see The Diana Exhibit, which was amazing, but to do any other tours costs more. You can do a self-guided audio tour, which is what I'd do next time, but that probably costs extra too. Also, driving there can be very confusing, even with GPS. I'd call directly for specific directions.",MarthaS767
20,Disappointing tour,"We had a tour of the Queen Mary about 35 yrs ago that was excellent. This time we signed up for the Ghosts tour and it was a cheesy, Disneyesque style haunted-house tour. I was hoping for a real tour that would tell us about some of the spookier history of the ship. YUK! Don't waste your money on this tour. We were also able to walk around the ship, but were handed a map that was hard to read. I don't recommend this attraction.On the other hand, we had lunch in the Promenade Restaurant on the ship and it was delicious. the service was great, too.",Lemon60
50,"Amazing art deco and engineering, try the Observation Bar","Once the biggest and fastest liner in the world, she was so quick you could water ski behind the Queen Mary!Every piece of fact or trivia about the ship is amazing, as is the beautiful vessel herself, she has a long and fascinating story filled with celebrity, luxury, war stories and plenty of ghosts.This was a quick re-visit to see how the ship was doing and show a friend as Ive been several times before (including to get married.)Stepping on is like walking into a different era, the style and beauty of the 30s has been preserved, but the ship is HUGE and walking and round and finding your way can take a while.With restaurants and bars on board its good to stop on for the evening evening and have a drink in the Observation Bar, and try the restored hotel.Looking after the ship is a massive task and every time I come something has got better and something else worse, on this occasion the decks are much improved but the hull and superstructure paint is peeling off badly, so I hope this is high on the fix sheet.In total Ive spent over solid a week on the ship, and on this 90 minute run around still found parts Id never seen before.The self guided tours are great as you get to take in the grandeur at your own pace, and the more serious ghost tours definitely worth it, though the packaged paranormal tour only really good for seeing the swimming pool as its a bit cheesy.Worth a visit as its a world apart from everything else in LA, and the hotel is a cool place to stay and the more paying visitors the longer she will survive.",Matt R
40,Haunted Passport,"I am interested in the paranormal, not the horror which is why I chose the Haunted Passport instead of the scarier Dark Harbor. And it's October...The Haunted Passport includes a self-guided Shipwalk Tour including Haunted Encounters Tour, Ghosts and Legends Show and Queen Mary Story and Historic Exhibit. The Haunted Encounters Tour is an hour long, the Ghosts and Legends Show is 30 minutes. There is not enough time to do one right after the other. I suggest taking the shorter Ghosts and Legends Show first, then the other. I did the opposite and wished I did it the way I am suggesting.Of course, there is no guarantee you will see any paranormal activity. I did not. I went by myself (my friends and family were too busy that day). I would think it would have been more fun with others. Because of all the stairs (and there are a lot of stairs!) the tour is not accessible by wheelchair.The cost is around $30, well worth it. You can spend several hours there, so much to see. The staff there is so helpful. There is a free shuttle from town to the Queen Mary.",Traciran
30,Great old ship,"It was a thrill to wander around this old ship especially with her storied history. Unfortunately we took a tour that focused on the ""ghosts"" of the ship and was kind of contrived. I would have preferred a tour that focused on the ship's history and uses but maybe we will do that another time. I am glad I saw it anyway and would recommend it if you are in the area.",mkelly5555
10,A vaste of time,"We were very disappointed about the Queen Mary. The ship should have so many good stories to tell, yet they managed to tell only very few. We went on the tour and cannot recommend to anyone. I normally praise the Americans for making great museums, but this is boring and overpriced. But the worst is that they never manage to tell those exiting stories, which this beautiful ship must have.",OnlyTheBest-Lux
50,Very Interesting!,"The Queen Mary is an impressive site! We took the World War II tour. Our tour guide, Danny, was very good! He told us so many interesting facts about the ship as we walked around the deck. It was amazing to hear the history of the ship and see how it has been restored back to 90% of the original condition. After the tour we were able to explore on our own. After we left the ship, we went on the Scorpion submarine. That was an experience! I am so glad it did it but I don' think I will go on another submarine. It is not for the claustrophobic or those who have a hard time crawling though small openings. All in all, this was a very enjoyable attraction.",Freehandeasy
40,Very historic and we enjoyed it,"I was very wary of the complaints about noise between rooms. I mentioned this at check in (by a very pleasant young woman) and she said it was because when the Queen Mary was designed, the engine noise would drown out conversations next door. That made sense to me but I still expressed concern. We were there on a Wednesday night in October so the ship was only two thirds full. We were put in a cabin far from the ballrooms. When we first arrived in the cabin, I could hear people talking next door but not what they were saying. When we left the next day, I heard a couple in the elevator saying they had suffered from having some excited people next door. It did not affect us but you need to be aware of this potential problem.Having addressed that we loved our stay. We were charged $17.00 extra for parking and $9.95 for a fee to cover the gym, WiFi and done other things. We only used the WiFi and it covered multiple devices on the same account and it worked well.There is lots to do and this is a great place to spend a night if you'd like to see what life on a cruise ship was like 50 plus years ago. My wife visited the Princess Diana exhibition and enjoyed it. We also got to buy a set of Royal Albert fine china cups and saucers. I have a very happy wife!For dinner, we went to George's Greek Cafe in Long Beach and had New Zealand lamb chops. They are to die for. There is a bus that leaves the hotel every 15 minutes most if the day and more frequently on weekends. It goes to main attractions in Long Beach including Pine Ave where George's Greek Cafe is located",Longmont_Mitch
40,A great venue for enjoying special events and exhibits,"Permanently docked in Long Beach, I've been to the Queen Mary on several occasions. I took in the Titanic exhibit when it was here which was a unique experience since both the Titanic and the Queen Mary are Cunard White Star Line Ships and share many similarities! Very moving!This is also a fun venue to enjoy seasonal offerings such as Halloween Haunts for the grownups and Winter Wonderland for the kiddos. Also check out the BBQ festival during the summer. I know you can stay on board (as it operates as a hotel and wedding venue as well) but I've never slept on the ship. Cool stories about it actually being haunted though! If you are visiting Long beach, this local icon is a definite ""must see.""",Sylliness
30,worth it if you have time to kill,"I had to kill time while my wife was in a work shop, if you are a history buff you will enjoy it. Ship is a bit run down but it has been anchored there for over 45 years. Cost about $37 to see the ship and a Russian submarine next door. Included a WWII tour about how the ship was used to transport troops from North America to Europe which was interesting. Also included a Haunted Ship tour that went into the bowels of the ship, very tongue in cheek but fun, the guides were funny in a dry Bob Newhart kind of way.",kmartinncemc
50,Dinner and Paranormal Walk,"Last week i went with 3 friends down to The Queen Mary located in Long Beach California. We did the dinner and Paranormal walk that is a total of about 3 hours for both. We started with dinner at the Mid ship cafe where we where greeted by a very nice girl that helped us with sitting for dinner and help with where to go after dinner to take our walk through the bow of the ship to look for any type of Paranormal activity. We had fish and chips, very good and a good portion for each of us. After dinner we grabbed a drink at the bar then headed over to meet our tour guide. We where taken down to different parts of the ship in search of people whom died on the ship many years ago. Our tour guide was really into his narration where it just made it more spooky and interesting. We ended in the boiler rooms and engine compartment( please keep on mind this ship is as big as the Titanic and looks just like it ). So as we went on our spooky travels we where given the chance to work with different types of instruments to detect any presence of Paranormal activity. We didn't see or here anything, but it was super cool, and i would do it again.",RayManhattan
40,Attention on deck!,Plenty of tour activity conducted by ship staff during the day. But much nicer spending the late evening walking the upper deck and looking out over the water towards the colorfully lit downtown Long Beach. Some areas of the wood deck can be a bit slippery.,Nyqwil
40,The Queen and the Attractions,"I personally enjoy spending time on QM. I have performed for events there (Ink and Iron, Dark Harbor, NYE) and it's always been a great time with hospitable staff. The ol' ship is more of a hotel/nightspot but it still offers a lot of fun events on ship and off. I haven't taken a tour of QM since I was a kid so I can't offer anything there. Overall, go. It's a fun day and it's a bit of history to boot.",MrDibbs90712
20,Beautiful but disappointing!!!,"Very disappointed, after paying what now seems like lots of money to go and walk around this once beauty of the seas I have become disillusioned and so have the owners form what I could see.Once the majestic cruise liner, travelling to and fro and providing service to thousands of travellers and soldiers. It now serves as a money making rundown attractions.After being hurried at the ticket office we embarked of the ghost tour for 30 or so minutes (the high lite) after that,we where left to our own devices with no great guidance form signage around the liner.Thinking that the Diana show was included in our hefty price we proceeded to enter the exhibition only to be told it was not included in our price.As we were day trippers we could only go into to certain areas as the rest of the ship is closed off to Hotel guests and special occasion visitors.But there is light at the end of tunnel we bought a combined pass to see the USS IOWA and we where not disappointed see review under USS IOWA well worth the visit skip Queen Mary just go straight to IOWA.Happy travelling.",Majak168
40,"Some tours are great, some should be avoided","The tour of the ship is basically self-guided. Go at your own pace. You can purchase additional guided tours. We took two tours: The Haunted Encounters and Ghosts and Legends.The Good: Haunted Encounters. Bradley was our tour guide and he was fantastic. He really knew his stuff and took us around the ship where many of the hauntings have occurred. The swimming pool was downright creepy. So was the nursery. (You don't go in the nursery but Bradley told great stories about it.) He had a funny vernacular of saying ""right"" (like some Canadians say, ""eh?"") after every few sentences but after awhile, we actually enjoyed his quirky style. He is a FANTASTIC storyteller.The Bad: Ghosts and Legends. UGH. Really lame special effects at the swimming pool and our tour guide was awful. In the beginning he showed a video and we couldn't hear a word he said because he was a low talker AND he mumbled. He tried to be creepy to get us in the mood but all it did was make me roll my eyes. The special effects were downright cheesy and many of the spots we visited were the same spots we visited on the previous tour. Small children may get frightened by the swimming pool special effects and the water pouring in from the hull of the ship. My 12-year-old just rolled her eyes through the whole tour and proclaimed it ""dumb.""Another problem was the logistics of getting to your tour. The staff seemed a little clueless at times. They tell you to wait in one area and then all of a sudden a tour starts and you aren't sure if that's your tour. We noticed numerous people were in the wrong tour, partly because the Haunted Tour and Ghosts and Legends tours are similar in nature.We were in the wrong area for one tour and since there is no sign telling you what the tour is, you're kind of on your own to figure it out. ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE THE TOUR STARTS! Also of note: On the Ghosts and Legends tour there is a lot of walking up and down stairs. Half of our tour did not make it to the end. I had to tell the tour guide to stop walking because an elderly woman with a bad hip was lagging way behind us--she was an entire floor above the rest of the group struggling to go down the stairs. This is not a good tour for those who are not mobile or in wheelchairs.The Great: The part of the ship where they show the various classes is awesome. There are mock staterooms for all classes including the crew. My kids really enjoyed seeing how large the rooms were since we cruise a lot and the staterooms are much smaller now.The Unknown: The Princess Diana. This was sold out, much to the dismay of our two girls. Apparently this happens a lot so try and get to the ship around opening time, not late morning as we did.",SportsReporter
50,If you don't do this - you will really miss out.,We did the self guided tour and took about a good half day to do it. It was a great experience being guided around the ship and the information you gained was great. The visuals were also good. All in all great value.,Honisoiquimalypense
50,Must see attraction!!,"What a fantastic experiance we had on board the Queen Mary! This is a fasinating tour you must do. The team who work on board are really helpful and informative without being 'on top of you'. Make sure you have a fancy cocktail in the observation bar, relaxed in a stunning location. You may not favour the latest money making attraction of the ghost tour, but we found it quite informative and you get to see out of reach areas in the bowels of the ship. Altogether a fantastic visit that we would highly recommend. Reserve a full day to visit! Hopefully we will visit again soon.",callumat1
40,"her madge, the queen mary (1) long beach","i love wandering around the queen mary in long beach. the ship has alot of character and its nice to go back in time not only to the people and culture, but the maritime and engineering aspects as well. 4th of July is always grand and other activites throughout the year make the ship a destination to visit often. we have stayed in the hotel as well. this allows you to wander around at night, which conjures up that spooky 'it's haunted' allure. the rooms are nicely laid out and it's truly a 'trip' to sail for the night. reccomend for all ages.",Trixie D
50,Great place to spend your morning or afternoon,"We spend our afternoon here, and it was great, the ship looks very good considering her age and the many people visit her everyday. We took the World War II tour and it was very very interesting, the guy that gave the tour was good inform, and also took the ghost tour, they take you to the places where ghosts have being seen, and to give it a more spooky effect, you can see lights and kids voices on the pool area, where kids have being seen. To be in a ship that has that much history and to know in it;s time was the most luxury in it's time, is very cool.",rbk20
40,Waited a lifetime,"My husband evidently had a picture of the Queen Mary in their parlor growing up in Newfoundland and I guess he had drawn pictures of her many times. He was really pleased to be finally on the ship that had fascinated him as a child. I had been there before so I was pleased that they had added an exhibit of Lady Diana's life and some actual dresses she had worn. They had done a great job of showing Diana's relationship to the real Queen Mary that is William's great great Grandmother. His life is also depicted and new baby George. The display was mostly dolls of various sizes dressed in clothes Lady Diana wore but there were a few actual dresses. They were on loan from various people that owned them. Somehow it made me sad. The dresses were nothing without her in them. A simple navy sleeveless dress was stunning on her. The ship is used as a hotel now, so you can't just go anywhere. You have to go outside to stairs and elevators to get to the engine room and displays at the bottom and stern of the ship. I had to ask for help to find things as the signage was poor and the map they give you, not too clear. I asked one girl how to get somewhere and she just said go back the way you came. That wasn't true we had to go another way. The engine room and the propeller, where you can look down into the water and see it attached to the ship, was really impressive. The food there was very expensive, so unless you're willing to pay $10 for a bowl of soup or a sandwich, you shouldn't go hungry. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm glad I could help him realize a lifetime dream.",Marilyn K
50,Lovely day out! We went on the Russian sub as well!,We all thoroughly enjoyed this... We walked from long beach only to find there was a free shuttle!!!! but it was a lovely walk :)It was reasonably cheap and we had an informative and enjoyable day out. We even sat on the deck and drank a few pints in the sun was a beautiful day. Everyone was very helpful and knowledgable :),Dk52BxC
30,A little better than average for Attraction,"Would prefer to have the ship updated or something. Felt like outdated and a tad creepy. Staff was great but I would not want to stay there. A little overpriced for what you get but Long Beach doesn't have many attractions. Glad I been, but most likely will not return again.",Bestbgoing
40,Great area to Visit,"So great to see this iconic ocean liner that treated so many people to incredible transatlantic crossings sitting in Long Beach alongside todays modern cruise terminal with the modern cruise ships visiting. unfortunately the Queen Mary is looking a little tired nowadays and we decided not to take a trip inside but just admired her beauty from the outside, but still well worth the visit to see this grand old lady of transatlantic crossings.",Yorkie1948

10,One night stay on Queen Mary.,"We stayed for one night on the Queen Mary. (that was enough!)We were part of a group of 34 traveling across America.The bar was amazing and we were given a tour of the ship by a staff member who was very knowledgeable.I asked if Wi Fi was available and was told that it was ""NOT PART OF OUR PACKAGE"" and that it would cost approx $10.00.In the room there was an iron and a hairdryer, but no facilities for making tea or coffee.If you want tea or coffee you have to go to Starbucks on board and pay for it.The walls between the rooms are very,very thin we could hear all the conversations (and swearing from the next cabin).While using the bathroom I encountered a Cockroach, which I killed with my shoe!There was at lest 2 wedding parties and one other function on the ship and it was busy.Maybe we stayed at the wrong time.",RICHARDJFOX
30,One night treat,"We stayed for the one night as a special treat for our anniversary. Rooms were like taking a step back in time but with a modern twist. The Art Deco features in the bar are absolutely amazing and a must see. Overall an excellent experience but had disappointing service in the restaurant where they tried on two occasions to overcharge us for our wine. Just make sure you check your bill. Tour was very good and shows you parts of the boat you can't see on your own. Reception was a bit dodgy, being booked into a room that was already occupied. Hotel room and bar , and tour are a four star rest, well gauge for yourself.",fifee48
10,Hotel or function venue?,"We arrived at the ship in a group booking and was given a room very near the gang way, we asked to move as we were aware at the time of being allocated our room that there was 2 functions on the ship and most of the guests were not staying on the ship. We were told no change of rooms was possible, only to find out that other members of our party were moved after our request was turned down. Not good public relations. From 12.30 to 3 am there was heavy footfall over our heads and most seem to leave in high spirits, also engines running in the car park. We had a very disturbed night, and we WERE wearing ear plugs as advised. The straw that broke the camels back was the early morning wake up call from the room next door who obviously hadn't heard any noise from our room or they wouldn't have been as vocal as they were during their morning workout.On complaining about the function guests leaving and keeping us awake the receptionist didn't apologise or make any notes and I felt the complaint was dismissed out of hand. I know that they had no control over what happens in private rooms, but hotel guests not at functions shouldn't be put in rooms that are near the exits!The bathroom fittings are original and that means the enamel on the bath was mostly missing. I feel that if the ship remains as a hotel then updated bathrooms are a must.The tour of the ship was very interesting, but as a hotel guest I thought I would be able to visit the Diana exhibition at no extra charge or a discounted entry fee.The meal we had in The Chelsea was first class, and coffee from Starbucks Ewan's also good, but to have no coffee available in the rooms was also disappointing.Overall the ship was well worth a visit but to stay on board is not recommended by me.",Nicki C
50,Brilliant,"Stayed for two nights, was amazed by the interior, truly wonderful inside, the rooms the interior, the views absaloutly wondeful.the exterior views are really great too.so pleased we booked it for our anniversary.",john m
50,worth a visit,The Queen Mary tour was really worth doing. Wonderful history and fascinating legends and ghosts tour. You can either do a guided tour or your own self guided tour which we did and thoroughly enjoyed it all.,olddadswell
40,"All inclusive food, fun, adventure, nightlife & history.","I love this place! There's so much to see and do that I recommend an overnight stay to be able to take it all in. There's an on-ship tour to meet about any interest- from Historic WW11 to Ghost & Legends with it's spooky yet fun special effects, and even a Russian Scorpian Submarine to traverse. Take the self-guided tour and make sure you hit the engine & propeller room if nothing else. The food options are as diverse as the tours. We loved Sir Winston's (a 5-star dining experience) as well as the Queen Mary Sunday Brunch (make reservations for earlier in the day for a less busy experience).A must see is the historic Observation Bar for some nightlife and dancing. The live music was hoping and bar scene was lively with patrons dressed in period-type clothing.Add a gym, beautiful views, shopping, ghost hunting, and enough history to make you feel like you've been transported back in time and you can see why we love coming to the Queen Mary!",kclymon11
40,Beautiful Old Gal,Was really great to walk around such a good looking old ship with so much history. We were there on a smoking hot day of 105deg so up on deck it was a bit uncomfortable for us having come straight from Winter. But the rest of the ship is air-conditioned.The museum part of the ship shows you just what it was like to be aboard during her Hay day. However the engine room can be a little boring for those with no mechanical interest. We found it amazing though.The propeller took us by surprise though. They have done amazing work to put that on display. Shame some idiots have used it as a wishing well.I was however surprised to find Starbucks aboard.,Daniel R
40,Historical Ship with a rich history....and sometimes...Ghosts!,"For over ten years the Queen Mary has been part of my daily drive just off Ocean Blvd in Long Beach. I never tire of her majestic silhouette! In my opinion, the two main reasons to visit the ""Queen"" is simple... Its' history and its ""Art Deco"" craftsmanship; which is rare!It is a virtual time machine when luxury liners were defined differently than today. When touring the ship you will feel what life was like during its ""hey day."" Beginning as a luxury cruise liner and later, a ""World War II troop carrier the ship has lived a long life. The guest quarters, the officers quarters, the bridge, the grand staircase and especially the ""Art Deco"" ballroom all giving us a glimpse into its history! Stop into the gift shop which was formerly Winston Churchill's floating office during World War II! Take a picture in front of his fireplace in a ""matching pose."" See the original china and silver... spectacular!While visiting you may take the time to visit the current residents, the Ghost's! A tour of spectacular history and a tour of the ship that was ""off limits"" to passengers.The ship does serve as a hotel, I will tell you that it is very quaint! However, if you are expecting a roomy, modern hotel and new amenities... this may not be for you.It is truly a marvel worth seeing. Enjoy!Note: Even a day trip allows you entry to the ship. And if you dine there, parking is usually free. The Ghost tours or other special event do require a fee.",Jeffrey K
20,not really an attraction,"went on a whim and paid 60.00 for a tour of the queen. Well not much to look at, just a few glass inclosed examples of the different state rooms and pictures of the main dining rooms and of course the captains room and 1st. mate and etc....And the engine room..The whole thing kinda reminded us of a museum that is spread way too far apart and that you couldn't touch. the whole thing is about an hour to see it all. If your into reading the captions on the bottom of some pix then your are in the right place.",stevet127
50,Great history,We took my father on the Queen Mary as he came back on it in WWII. It is amazing to see this massive ship and learn of it's history. You will need a wheelchair for those that have trouble walking long distances. Be sure to park close by going to the restaurant /hotel side.,MO2cats
40,A trip back in time,"We family and I enjoyed visiting the stately Queen Mary while in the Los Angeles/Anaheim area. We took two tours -- Ghosts & Legends and the Glory Days. We had a most informative and usually comical tour guide (an older Black gentleman) -- he really knew his facts!! He took us down to the boiler room, the swimming pool, ballroom area, and even one of the staterooms that looked much like it did in the 1930s. We didn't see any ghosts but got to see how the rich and famous traveled to Europe before the days of jets. The ship also includes several neat gift shops. This is a great place to spend an afternoon and slip away from the LA traffic. They area around the Queen Mary was gearing up for a big Halloween celebration -- looked like fun!!",SuzanneM2013
50,Good day out at Queen Mary,We are holidaying inLA. Well worth the approx 40 mile drive to Long Beach. We took 2 tours. Ghosts and Legends which was good fun. Also did WWII guided tour. FascinatingInsight into the history of the ship. We enjoyed lunch in the cafe which given the lovely view was not at all expensive. Good day out.,Linda M
30,Meh,"It is nice, but I expected a much nicer experience. I expected to have one of the suites open for viewing (since it is also a hotel), luckily they were cleaning and I got to see a room regardless and thank God I didn't stay there. Not worth the $30 (with Scorpion viewing in my opinion.",Victor C
50,What a wonderful ship!,"Stepping aboard the Queen Mary, you almost feel like you're truly stepping back inside. We spent our New Years Eve aboard the Queen Mary, enjoying the many different rooms with different styles of music aboard the boat. I have to say, the highlight would definitely be the dueling pianos, how fantastic that was! The party aboard the top deck of the ship as midnight came closer was wonderful and everyone was given party favours to celebrate with as the fireworks boomed overhead. A great night on a true historical marvel.",KiaOraKiwi
40,"""Memories of the past""","We didn't really know what to expect and were pleasantly surprised. The ship offers accommodations as well as tours and there is always something different going on. The decor is very reminiscent of the era and is very nostalgic and lovely. It is very nice to walk around the ship at your leisure and we found it very interesting. We did stay aboard the ship. We found our room quite small but they are all different and they did allow us to change our room. We ate at several of the restaurants aboard ship. They were all good but we found Sir Winston's a little high priced. Definitely not for a family meal. We were celebrating our anniversary and they did give us a nice complimentary dessert. The only real issue we had was the heat. We found our room very cold and you cannot control the temperature in the room. You have to call the desk and have them turn it on. It is supposed to take about 30 minutes but we never did get heat, so bring a sweater! We used the free shuttle offered and enjoyed the whole area. There is a lot to see and do, including the aquarium and various water tours. I would go back as there is so much we didn't get to enjoy. Don't pay for the upgrade though, as they offer it to you there at a lesser cost, if available.",Kim T
40,Worth a visit,"Well worth the trip across LA to visit this great old ship. Even the Kids had a great day here, its great to see how life was in the old days. We had afternoon tea in the Tea rooms a little expensive but worth every cent.",skull0107
50,Trip back in time,"Loved the decor, room was decent size, and had everything we needed.Loved the tours on board the ship. We are definitely going back.",JBPIRANHA
40,Imagining the olden days of ship travel,"Not being a good sailor, it was good to board this luxury liner whilst moored.We did a War tour and had an excellent guide.Being able to wander around at our leisure was terrific and we opted to use the free audio guide but it wasn't all that helpful with directions as some of the sections were closed.The ship is kept in immaculate condition and is now also an hotel.Some parts would have been hard for wheelchairs but you were advised of this.The purchasing of tickets was very slow and possibly more booths need to be open early in the day.",RJC1951
50,The Queen Mary - Extraordinary Museum,"My family and I visited the Queen Mary exhibit in Long Beach. We visited with our 18 and 16 year-old children. All of us were fascinated by the ability to walk around on a self-guided tour, as well as the escorted tour that took us from the main deck of the ship down to the engine rooms. The staff were all quite knowledgeable about the history of the ship, both as a luxury trans-atlantic liner and a troop transport ship during WWII. The legendary stories of paranormal activity on the ship were quite entertaining. We even got to visit some of the very plush guest rooms (the ship is also a floating hotel). Highly recommended for a whole or half-day visit.",JSFMD
40,Queen Mary Visit - Hopefully One of Many!,"Ticket Staff are very friendly, always a smile!The onboard Staff were even better! Happy, Helpful, Attentive and always with a Smile! I hope to return one day soon, from Newcastle NSW, Australia.",Timotheos2119
30,Visit to the Queen Mary,"My husband and I decided to do something different over the weekend, so went to see the Queen Mary. It was a fun day, but not quite the interesting tour we thought we'd have. The Ghost Tour was so cheesy - it would have been more fun (and creepy) if they didn't try to turn it into a really dumb haunted house (flashing lights, etc.). Touring the inside of the ship as a part of the Ghost Tour was pretty cool... just lose the cheeseball ghost stuff.",Tareason
40,Something to See,The basic package and self guided tour is the way to go. There was a festival going on when we were there so it made it extra fun as people were dressed in the era. If you have family/friends that like engineering they will love the engine room. We were glad we went and it gave us some variety between beach days.,marversp
30,Ok,The ship was massive and amazing. We did the ghost tour which was loads of fun!! Really enjoyed that. The view from the ship of Long Beach is lovely. The ship itself we walked around each level and it was ok. Nice to learn about it and look around but definitely not worth $25. It was quite boring (except for the ghost tour) We were wishing we went to the aquarium instead.,FrequentFlyer2012
20,Pricey Toursit Trap,"Beautiful ship but the ""tour"" is confusing and you can't see all that much of the ship. Considering the price, $25/person, and the limited areas to see, it's just not worth it. See the USS Iowa instead.",danmcmartin
40,"Interesting, but not wow!","Interesting way to spend a few hours wandering about. We took the headphone option, but it is unnecessary because we had trouble finding the spots to ""listen"" and by just wandering around we found more interesting things to see. It was kind of confusing, the ship is big and because it is also a hotel, it is not easy to find your way around. We ate lunch at the Tea Room, which was good, but maybe not for men or teenaged boys.",aawchoo c
30,Lovely old ship...,"We visted the ship during a stay in Long Beach. It is a magnificent old ship with a lot of history. The staff were seemingly uninterested in us as we wandered aimlessly around looking for the engine roome which (strangely) can only be accessed through a seperate entrance to the rear of the ship? If we didnt ask we would never have found them. I was surprised to see a down market 'shop' on board such a magnficent vessel selling crappy souveniers and things with no connection to the ship whatsoever. It really doesnt need this kind of 'tat' as there are plenty of shops already offering that in the town.The ship could do with a bit of a clean up, but all in all it is a pleasure to stroll around the deck of such a magnificent old vessel.",Ian M
30,"Top of your ""B"" list","She is a grand ship, the fittings are wonderful and the feeling is clearly nostalgia. I suggest you go for a self guided tour because the guides seem to range from really good to godawful and it really isn't the type of information that you need as much as an experience to feel.As a museum it is just barely ok, as a ship it is really cool, as a piece of the history of the greatness of USA it is a must do.",Twistoffcap
50,Wonderful Experience,Had a combination ticket for the ship and the Princess Diana Exhibition. Both were fantastic. The ship was everything one could imagine in the times when she was a travelling experience. Everything on the ship itself was still original - an amazing feat to keep it this way. A truly floating palace.The Diana Exhibition was truly enjoyable. It went right through to the present day with some of Katherine's memorabilia. The information attached to each item was thorough and extensive.Would put this on my to-do list if ever I get to LA again.,Joy V
10,Terrible experience,"Don't spend your gold time to see Queen Mary and expect to pay more ,entrance fee is one plus you have to pay for guided tour or exhibition rooms ,nothing to see I didn't get why they recharging $23 just entrance but inside u have to pat again?Terrible is there almost empty boat and if you want to see you have to pay for that additionally ?easiest way is to watch YouTube and free",Elli96
50,Really enjoyed,"Had a lovely time, bought a combination ticket from the Aquarium earlier in the day which allowed us to do both the Submarine and the Queen Mary (I think it was meant to be the ghost tour but we had a baby with us and she said it would be scary!)Really enjoyed seeing a traditional ship and we kind of wished we had stayed there as it was so amazing to see. The submarine was brilliant with recordings talking in each room as you went through informing you of interesting facts about the submarine throughout.",EmmalucyB
20,Great ship ... terrible management,"Bought the combination Russian sub and Queen Mary self-guided tour. The staff working both ships were absolutely clueless and couldn't care. I walked on to the submarine for which no one checked my ticket until I was halfway down the sub. Two or three of the explanation audio systems weren't even turned on, and the smoke detectors beeped from bow to stern needing their batteries replaced.The signage on the Queen Mary is lacking, the person issuing the headsets did his best attempt to dissuade me from taking the tour. ""You won't need the headset, it's a waste of time, you'll be better off on your own, you'll be here all day, make sure you're back by 5 pm."" The audio directions are terribly confusing, and at least one of the stops has been completely removed from the itinerary, but not from the maps or audio sequence.For a ship as grand as this, you'd think they could manage the place commensurately. The Coup de Gras was the $15 parking fee for 4 hours!",elbojbb
50,A great experience,"Having always been fascibated by Queen Mary, we were excited about staying on this ship. Our cabin was spacious and comfortable. In her time, the ship would have been a floating palace with the best of everything to eat , drink and wear! Personally, I found the different decks both inside and outside amazing and extremely interesting. The food we ate in the promenade cafe and chowder restaurants were good and accpetably priced.All in all, we stayed 2 nights and it was perfect as it was different and unique.",CHEADY5678
40,Spooky Tour,"Not being a real fan of ghosts (no disrespect intended to Patrck Swayze or to Casper), I was not too thrilled to take the ghost tour in the Queen Mary with my 18 year old daughter. They take you around the ship and talk about the various ghosts that inhabit the ship. I DID get an eerie feeling at a few of the spots but my daughter felt ""something bad"" at the one spot where a man was killed when a gas powered door closed unexpectingly. She told me that she felt that something was ""unhappy"" that we were there. I believe her. RIP to those still on board.",Mike E
50,nice but pricey,We had 2 tours around the ship the guide was very knowledgeable and funny. Over priced thou for the experience. You can buy the cheapest ticket and still see it all.,misswarley
50,Great experience,I wouldn't use it as a hotel for a long vacation but the experience of just one night is amazing. It's not modern luxury but that's the point of the hotel the ships renovated to its classic glory days and you can immerse yourself in the history. Again it's as the ship used to be so the walls are thin and you can here everything next door so bring ear plugs. A great experience to stay on a ship of this era. The delux state rooms are extremely comfortable and of a good size.,PilotReviews
50,Historically relevant,"The Queen Mary was a luxury liner, converted into a troop carrier, and back to a liner. It's now berthed in Long Beach, but still has a limited number of hotel rooms available for lodging. We toured her and found it very informative. Depending on the tkt price you buy, depends on how long on board you spend. We stayed two hours and could have spent longer, but ran out of time. There is an elevator for the various decks, should steps be too much. However, one is able to see more if not just limited to the elevator.",Jane G
30,nostalgic only,the restaurants were overpriced except for the breakfast buffet and happy hour in the Observation Bar. the rooms are badly in need of upkeep due to the amount and volume of leaks.,izymassage E
10,NEVER GO!,"Not worth $1 never mind $30. There were no staff to ask questions to and when you found them they couldn't answer questions, the whole place was so over priced and isn't worth visiting. Needs a serious face lift and there is literally nothing to see. The restaurant was beyond awful, with rude staff and poor food. The only positives were the princess Diana exhibition was interesting and the views were good. Everything was closed...just don't waste your money on this.",Travell1ng
10,Dreadful display of cabins and awful restaurant reconstruction,"I was looking forward to visiting the Queen Mary but was so disappointed. You don't see a real cabin, it's a dreadful mock up in a dark dingy part of the stern down near the engine room. And the awful restaurant display is not the real restaurant but three tables stuck in a tiny viewing area to represent the three classes of dining when traveling on board. The Queen's Salon and Mauritania Room were not open to the public on the day we visited due to private functions. The first class swimming pool is only open for the ghost tour. I do not recommend the Queen Mary unless you only want to walk around the open deck and see an engine room.",GordsGuinness
20,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed with the Queen Mary, my family and I payed rather a lot of money for what we thought was going to be an excellent afternoon but it was far from that.The staff are helpful however the actual ship is in poor condition. The ship carries a lot of history on board however that history has been ruined, firstly most of the ship wasn't open to the general public, it was either not open to us or being used for a private event.The worst part of this museum was the reconstruction of the different cabins, this was very poor. Overall I am very disappointed with the Queen Mary and I shan't be selling it to anyone!",Bridget S
10,Biggest Disappointment!,"I was actually excited to visit the Queen Mary. An old cruise ship where famous actors had been, how cool! Well...no, just no. Worst museum ever. Everything worth seeing is in the basement of this ship. It's dark, creepy, and just thrown together. It's not well cared for and the whole place is filthy! The rest of the ship has been turned into a hotel. It's mostly for people who want to see a ghost. I was completely saddened with the state of this ship and how little it was cared for.",Danielle S
40,Fun!,This place was a lot of fun and very interesting. I have seen it on the travel channel and was happy with the tour. Apparently the plave is haunted.,trustme58
50,This fine Lady!,Walking around the Queen Mary is like walking back in time. With it's wonderful Art Deco decor to it's lovely staterooms. It's a nice weekend getaway and close to downtown Long Beach.,Mary Helen C
50,If you enjoy ocean/ships then this is place is fabulous,"I absolutely love this ship. Its an incredible vessel, from the beauty and grandeur of the vessel to this inner workings of the ship and the history of it. Its wonderful to be able to wander aboard this throw back and they have done a phenomenal job of preserving the overall atmosphere without compromising modern accommodations as well. The breakfast buffet is one of the best - Sunday Champagne Brunch is a nice treat. Tables by the window are very nice because you can view the ocean and surrounding activities on the water. The walking/audio tour can actually be a lot of fun. It is very interesting for those who care about this history of the ship, and it leads you to a lot of places you might miss if you were just wandering aboard. Don't miss the viewing of the prop at the end; it is really quite impressive! They have built a special walk through so that you can actually see this, as it is usually not possible to see being under the water. You can visit the prop even without a tour, so make sure to ask if you can't find it. The engine room is really amazing if you know anything about modern engine rooms! The Haunter Encounters tour is a bit corny, honestly, but it is very cool to be able to see the boiler room, which you can't see otherwise; so if this interests you then you might want to just do one of the passports that includes this tour. Overall, I would recommend a passport to get the most out of the visit and plan to eat lunch on the ship. It is often nicer to visit in the morning if you are concerned about crowds at all; but no matter when you visit the ship is large enough that you should have a good experience.",Jennadah
50,Winston's High Quality.,"Returned to Winstons after a couple of years to find that it is still on my top 10 list. Fine dinning and top notch service. Winstons is for that special dinning experience, beautiful.",nick m
50,what a surprise!!,"couldn't believe the rooms on the ship. aside from the history that goes along with the Queen Mary, the rooms were quite comfortable and nicely appointed. Also had dinner aboard in the Sir Winston dining room, it was delicious !!",susan c
30,Strange end to tours,My daughter is a big fan of haunted places so we did the Ghosts & Legends tour which was a little bit hokey. The Haunted Encounters tour was more what she was looking for but both tours ended strangely. They basically leave you off in the middle of nowhere and even outside. We constantly had to show our tickets in order to get back to the stores on the promenade deck. While we enjoyed our day I didn't feel very welcomed by the staff.,SueP2013
50,Great place for paranormal enthusiasts!!!,"My sister and I went here August 2013 because we have long heard stories about how haunted the ship is. We love paranormal stuff and are way into haunted places and stuff, so we went. The package we got was the Haunted Passport which includes an hour-long guided tour, a 30-minute special effects show where they try and scare you (kind of like a haunted house, but on a boat), and then a self-guided tour where you can read about the ship's history and long list of ghost sightings. The tour was phenomenal; our guide, Laura, was very informative and kept the mood happy and light. While we didn't see any full body apparitions, the camera did catch quite a few ghost orbs and misty figures in the pool area as well as one of the ballrooms. The boiler room was creepy because I saw many things out of the corner of my eye, it was spooky. We ended up chickening out of the haunted special effects tour mostly because I am a tad claustrophobic, but it was a great tour. I am definitely doing it again whenever I get back to California.",minimacaz
20,Could have been a great experience,"This trip started out with a 40 minute wait just to get tickets to go onboard the ship. I was really excited as I have a degree in History and had the opportunity to tour the ship. Unfortunately what I saw was a ""nickel and dime"" approach and it lowered the value of what should have been a great tour. The Queen Mary plays a big part in the History of the U.S. and it's allies during World War II and after; it is now reduced to a tourist trap. The staff was extremely unhelpful and even childish in their comments and remarks to my wife and I; I was offended as I paid $15 to park and $29/person just to do a self guided tour that lacked proper signage and direction. We decided to upgrade our tickets so we could actually get information about the ship but the tour was a lame dramatized ghost tour more fit for Nott's Berry Farm. I can't recommend tour the Queen Mary based off my terrible experience.",Amn07
50,Princess Diana Exhibit is a fun history lesson,"Tis exhibit aboard the Queen Mary includes information and memorabilia from the reign of Queen Mary through the current royals. Of course, there is more space devoted to Princess Diana. There are dresses, photos, handwritten notes, official memorabilia, newspaper articles, lists, etc. if you enjoy the British Monarchy, this is a fun exhibit. It is informative and entertaining. Warning: we spent far more time here than we intended...there's so much to read!",Sheri V
30,Full steam ahead,"If you like stationary giant ships, this will be for you. It is sort of a cruise ship museum/hotel. They offer a variety of tours focusing on the history of the ship or on supposed ghosts/hauntings. The Ghosts and Legends tour is a haunted house experience with special effects, and was kind of cool. It would be too scary from little kids. Otherwise, you can roam around the decks and dine in a few areas. Be warned, the cheapest ticket is $25. There is a free city bus that runs between here and the Aquarium area where parking is $8.",nita999
20,Thats it ?,"We visited the Queen Mary hoping to be educated /informed and see a true piece of floating history .We were disappointed .The "" self guided tour "" requires some signage /attendants through out the tour so that you don't wander through the limited "" exhibits "" in circles . We handed our tickets to the attendant .We wandered up some stairs .We looked around an open area .Read some historical facts pasted on the walls .Followed a couple of signs in to the engine area .Did a complete circle and ended up back at the historical placards in 15 minutes .Not content with the very limited exposure to the ship we wandered into a wedding ( closed bar ) and then sat in the hotel lobby for a few minutes soaking in the ambience .There really is a lack of signage direction / assistance in the tour .We met others shaking their collective heads wondering /wandering in what was a very limited tour .Spend a couple of bucks and hire a few guides to provide direction / interpretation for gods sake .We toured the Russian sub ...you cant get lost on a tube ..yet they had a sub vet on board providing insights and interpretation",tomchuck19
50,Must see!,I was surprised my 12 yo daughter wanted to see this. We took a $12 dollar guided tour that took about an hour in evening. The guide was great with non stop commentary. If you like art deco it's a must see. Well worth it.,NeilDMc
40,Go back in time on the Queen Mary,It's a lovely old ship with wonderful art deco designs. Great views of downtown Long Beach. Spend the night and feel what it was like to cruise on this wonderful ship back in her day.,MHJC55
30,Foreign Visitors beware,"If you are a foreign visitor be aware that you will need to take your passports. We opted for the top entrance price which included the audio tour and 2 seperate tours of the ship. They did not ask us for identification when taking our money, but we were refused the audio tour because we didn't have identification. Although we paid the top price, when looking at out receipt, it stated no charge, so we had no arguement in getting out money back.We have been on too many self guided audio tours to count, yet this is the first time we have ever needed identification. It is outrageous that we were not told this when paying. This spoilt our trip.",Marilyn W
40,Historic Fun,I like that the Queen has fine dining at Sir Winston's Restaurant and that you feel that you are back in time while walking on the decks where so many famous people have walked.This is a fun way to spend the afternoon and have dinner.,PeggyChism
30,"if you want to go, do your homework -it cost much more than we expected","We went to the Princess Diana exhibit on the Queen Mary which was very good though it was so cold in there that we were quite uncomfortable. When we arrived we learned that our coupon deal only gave us access to the ship and it was another fee to see the exhibit so that was the 1st costly hit. But the one that burned us both up was when we went through the exit booth of the parking lot and were charged ANOTHER $15. This was compounded by the fact that I met my friend there and we each had to pay it.So if you want to go, do your homework. Check prices for the differing options of things to see. And find a place to park in Long Beach so you can ride the bus over if you want to skip the $15 parking.The other thing I did enjoy was a little chapel dedicated to the ""4 Immortal Chaplains"" for their sacrifices during WWII. I had never heard of this and it was very moving.",EWB-in-MB
50,The Queen Forever.....,"If you have never experienced the Queen Mary, then you should do so today! This magnificent ship will take your breath away.

The restaurants are excellent. It is truly an experience.",Bebe44
30,The Queen,"It was nice to explore the ship, especially for a romantic couple. Strolling the top deck, having couple of drinks overlook the sunset, and enjoying the museum walk with a fee, of course. Problem is the parking. It is not cheap.",seekers38
40,A real privilege,"My wife and I enjoyed a night onboard as part of a big US tour. We loved it. A bit faded in places but the inside kingsize cabin was huge and very comfortable. Free bus shuttle into Long beach for dinner - very convenient. Really enjoyed the self-guided tour around the ship, especially the first part - engine room and exhibition. Our only tiny criticism was a surly bar steward in the forward bar. He showed absolutely no interest in us and needs to seek a new career challenge. Overall though a real privilege.",Paul C
30,"Massive, historic and a bit creepy.","It's interesting to walk around on your own and just look at how things were back in the day. They require a minimum purchase at the curb ticket entrance: either a $15 dining voucher or some sort of ticket to an attraction. Once on the ship, you can wander around aimlessly. I always enjoy the bridge and Captain's quarters. Great view of downtown Long Beach as well. The Ghosts and Legends tour is fun, affordable and takes you through some areas not accessible to the general public.",Pilotchip
40,Worth a visit,"We spent most of our time in the Princess Diana Exhibit which was well worth the price of admission. Also rented the audio headsets, which I recommend. Although don't follow it numerically because you will be up down and all over, hit one deck at a time and bounce around to the numbers listed on the map.",DCV77

40,History,"The Queen Mary allows you to step back in time to see what ""Luxury"" once meant.There are photo's and details throughout the ship that explain the history of this beautiful vessel. I have been on the ship many times in the past 10 years and every time I am still seeing things I didn't see the previous times. Some area's are set up as they were used back in the day and they look creepy!I've had a drink in the Observation Bar while the sun was setting and it is a nice relaxing time to enjoy the view of Long Beach.",Annette F

You can walk through it on your own or if you prefer a more detailed history, take one of the tours. Either way it's a great ship. Every year in mid-October it turns into a haunted Halloween event, and quite spooky. It is also a hotel, and they say it's haunted so stay if you dare!",Cyndie H
50,She's old but still hardy,"The Queen Mary has been in Long Beach for a long time and has been a hotel and tourist site as long as she's been berthed here. I enjoyed the walking tour with relatives (it was my first time and I've lived in LB since 1975!) and also did the Ghosts and Legends tour. Sir Winston's is a destination, for sure, the staterooms look well appointed (and I asked to see one) and the kind people who let me see their room said they were very comfortable. It's easy to get to downtown and enjoy the restaurants but be aware, the only viable retail is in the East Village downtown.",Anne P
30,"Expensive, spooky and art deco","The Queen Mary is nice if you like vintage, Art Deco, old-style cruise ship things. There are several restaurants, rather pricey, a fee to park and another board the ship and some shops. They make a big deal out of the ""haunted"" attractions, which are either real or imaginary, depending on your outlook. It can be kind of gloomy and dingy, with old dark woodwork. I would say, if you have a big budget and like that history period, go see it, probably not more than once. Free busses run from the hotels and downtown.",FlowerPower68

Afterword's we walked about the ship and enjoyed the history of the Queen Mary's elegant demise..The ship is docked across from Long Beach showing a magnificent view of the city's skyline..Bon Appetit...",Kimmilala
50,When is a ship not a ship?,"When it's the Queen Mary, this is so much more! Perhaps because it doesn't go anywhere, but it surely is spectacular at staying still.Love their exhibits (especially the amazing ice house/sculpture experience they erected last winter) and dining. However, just seeing this grand ole lady, or watching July 4th fireworks from anywhere in the area makes a trip there worthwhile.For overnight, you can stay in real cabins without worrying about sea legs. I'm thinking of joining their dance 'cruise' weekend this coming December.",dshepard562

40,Great History with a great view,"If you're planning a trip to Long Beach, visiting the historic Queen Mary is a must! The ship which is permanently docked across the harbor from the beautiful downtown Long Beach skyline has plenty to entertain and fascinate a visitor. The Queen Mary is a lovely hotel with all of the interior restored to its beauty when it was sailing the seas. Stay there or just go for the day and take the historic tour. We went and enjoy eating at Sir Winston's but there are other restaurants to enjoy there as well. Walking around the exterior decks makes you feel like you're on an ocean cruise! There are little vintage shops and traveling exhibits too. Right next to the Queen Mary is docked a historical Russian submarine that you can tour through as well. It was amazing to see and fell what it must be like to have to live aboard a Russian sub! Right near the Queen mary there's park and views all around of the ocean. We really enjoyed ourselves there.",boloca
40,Great family experience with teens,"We took two teens on a tour of the Queen Mary which is in Long Beach. Basically it was a self-directed walking tour which included an area devoted to the history of the Queen Mary. Letters and memorabilia were on display which really captured the feel of this grand ship. We also viewed the historical displays of the various cabins and eating facilities available to the passengers. Our kids wanted to go on the Ghosts and Legend tour and so with limited time we missed the Princess Diana exhibit. But, I must say the ghost tour was wonderfully done. You are led through some really dark and creepy areas with an actor/guide. It was definitely scary for the kids and they loved it. We finished the day by eating at the Promenade restaurant which offers lovely views of the harbor. While the service was a little slow the food was great.",Baltimore48
40,Well worth the money,"We went to tour the Queen Mary while on vacation in San Diego, (yes, I know she is in Long Beach) but it was well worth the drive. We took the WW2 and the Ghosts and Legends tour that also included the former Soviet Submarine ""Scorpion"". Although I had been aboard the QM twice before I had not taken any of the tours. I learned a lot about the history and more of the QM and would advise anyone going to take the tours. The submarine was a self-guided tour but it was eye opening to see how small and confining life aboard a sub was in those days. I hope that the new subs are a little more roomy. The ""Scorpion"" had a crew of 78 men and I don't know where they all fit, because they certainly did not have enough racks for the men that I could see. All in all, these two vessels were an important part of our trip to California. Do not believe some of the reviews here that say this is a dirty unkept ship. Yes, there are some improvements being made to her, and in a couple of places there is some clutter but, remember that this is an active hotel as well and it takes upkeep to keep it up. Our history is rich in this country and we must all keep fresh in our minds what has and always will make THIS country the greates nation on God's green earth.",HoweFamilyMinistries
40,"Princess Diana exhibit was very nice, especially with baby's arrival","Be prepared to walk a lot and take a lot of stairs. The royal/Princess Diana Exhibit was very moving and enjoyable. Even my husband enjoyed looking at all of the royal history that was covered and her personal items.The ship is not super clean and plush but it is old and there is a lot of neat history involved.The Starbucks was a nice treat.Overall, it is a good way to spend a couple of hours.",zeta1985
10,Queen Mary day trip,"We are local and took out of town guests. The self tour that used to be free is now overpriced. To top it off, additonal fees are charged for attractions along the tour. Many important parts of the ship are closed. We have scratched this off our tour selection.",Fred C
40,Great old ship but cheesy tour,"Great old ship and I love visiting. The great ship tour is now gone and replaced by a very quick ""ghost tour"" with special effects. Quite cheesy and sad but if that's what brings people in. the ship looks quite worn compared to several years ago.",Lee7290
50,Queen Mary,"I have wanted to visit the Queen Mary for several years. When I was finally able to do so - she did not disappoint!! I only wish we'd had a full day to explore all of her! We were able to take the Ghosts and Legends tour, the self guided tour, explore the ship on our own and have a drink at the Observation Bar. I would also have loved to see the Princess Diana exhibit and the Russian submarine they have but there just wasn't enough time! I enjoyed myself enough that if I ever get back out to the west coast I will make it a point to visit the Queen Mary again.",Dana E
50,Wonderful Champagne Brunch!,What a cool place to come for brunch. So much to choose from and in a very cool atmosphere. $50 per person.,HBNANI
30,Interesting but overpriced – Ghosts & Legends tour definitely not for children,"If you’re in the Long Beach area then going to the Queen Mary is something you must do – it’s so famous and such a dominant part of the landscape. It’s fascinating just to be on the famous liner and although the parts you can see are limited, it’s still enough to give the feel of what it must have been like as a passenger. The art deco shops in the centre, the 30’s style bar at the back, and just exploring the decks make it worthwhile. However as mentioned by previous reports it’s overpriced, particularly with the $15 parking fee, and the day we went we were told the audio tour had a fault and we were told it would be much better if we just read the information boards as they say the same things anyway! – no advance notice of this was given before we bought our tickets, and no refund or discount offered at the entry point.As part of the entry price there is a free Ghosts & Legends Tour – WARNING – this is a dark and grim experience that is definitely not for children or those who suffer from claustrophobia. There are no warnings about this at the entry point, and as it’s free most people naturally will go on it. It begins in a dimly-lit room with the guide talking over film footage of the history of the ship. This concludes with grainy ‘Blair Witch’ style footage of three paranormal investigators which suddenly cuts off and we are then told, quite falsely, that the investigators disappeared from the ship and were never seen again! It was this as much as anything that freaked out our 12 year old. The tour then proceeds, led by the same humourless guide, through a series of very dimly-lit rooms and passages with loud recorded shrieks and wails playing at some points. The only saving grace is that after ten minutes or so, just before an elevator trip into the bowels of the ship, there is the opportunity for people to leave the tour with an assistant guide. We did this, as did another family and a couple of adults – about half the tour! Quite unacceptable that there are no warnings about the nature of this very confused ‘entertainment’ – it’s not a humorous ‘ghost train’ type experience but peddles lies in an attempt to really frighten people. A strange exercise given that one of the information boards on another part of the ship says it was always regarded by its crews over the years as a happy ship!",DandareOxford
10,Worst 4th of July .. spare yourself.,"Seats for about 1/10th of the guests.. or less. No seating on the decks or promenade while eating..No re-entry and the event was from noon to approx. 10pm.No outside food allowed and the crappy, cold burgers were $12.. with cheap sliced fake American cheese, which I had to eat on a dried out hot dog bun. Entrees at the few restaurants were $30-$40.. and by 6pm most of the restaurants had no space even on a waiting list.. no reservations.. no more guests allowed.Ridiculously long lines for food or the bathrooms. Think Disneyland x 10.Fireworks at 9pm were not spectacular for 2 hour wait on deck to have a spot.. lasted 10 minutes.Security made several announcements for anyone not in a chair or on one of the few benches to stand up. This included tired guests of all ages, small children, elderly, and my 7 month pregnant self was told to get up as well. Continued announcements to not sit on the stairs, then not stand on the stairs, then to get off the stairs or security might shut down the show.Not enough things to do on the boat for that amount of time.. the supposed separation of decade celebrations thru-out the day was non-existant. The same bands went to different rooms at different times, recycling their tunes. I ran into the same barbershop quartet 3 times.There were not enough seats to see the bands and people were frustrated in hot, over-packed rooms.The stand up comedy was beyond lame.I should have gotten off the boat ASAP, but wanted to see the fireworks. After that, it was a mad rush from everyone to get off and took an hour to get to car and highway.Also.. a pissed off crowd when the sound guy could not turn the ridiculous volume down, and even the DJ was complaining that his ears hurt..In summary: Not enough of anything to accommodate the people there. Boring and a waiting torture to get to the show, standing for hours. A very expensive waste.Will never be back.",Stephdotcom
50,Sir Winston's restaurant on board is worth the splurge,"We did not pay to get on the Queen Mary and see it which you have to do in order to go aboard during the day if you are not staying in their rooms. If you make dinner reservations there in the evening you can go aboard. Sir Winston's is elegantly beautiful, with views of the harbor. Relatively high prices but very good service and food.",Traworld2007
10,4th on the Queen Mary - terrible,"40 min lines in the sun to board, we already had our tickets! Long lines for bathrooms, no where to sit if you were able to stand in a line long enough to get take out food. 1 hour line at StarBucks to get a $3 bottle of water. No water fountains. They will not let you get back on if you leave the ship, even to buy a bottle of water. Terribly overcrowded, under staffed, one restaurant at 4PM stopped taking reservations and they already had a 2 hour wait, one restaurant had a prix fixed menu of $100 per person. One ran out of food. Only place we could find to eat at 4PM with a short line was a BarBEQUE buffet only $30 per person. By the time we left the line for that one was 2 hallways long.",Candice H

40,Fun Activity for Something Different,"I was in town for a week for work and was looking for a fun/different activity to do after a day in the office. The Queen Mary had an evening tour for fairly cheap ($12 I believe) lasting about 60 minutes. I have to admit that I'm a little awe-struck with big ships like this (this one in particular reminds me of what the Titanic could have been like to walk on) so I was excited before the tour even began. The tour itself was good (not awesome but not terrible...good for the money I'd say), but I'd certainly never stay at the hotel that's on board (part of the tour was to visit an old state room and it's nothing I'd like to sleep in, especially given that the ship is claimed to be haunted).",Jeremy M
20,Don't get stuck,"We went to see the Princess Diana exhibit and it was poorly lit. In places, you couldn't read the captions under the pictures. It doesn't take long to go through the exhibit. The description and advertising led us to believe that it would be a bit more than it was. The ship is confusing, not enough signage. We walked in and out of elevators, and frequently met the same people, over and over. We knew where we wanted to go but couldn't get there. The lack of signage is horrible, particularly in the front of the boat. We walked up and down three flights of stairs trying to get back in the boat. We were told there is a small sign ""somewhere"" that says it is not accessible except by stairs. The stairs in places are very steep. Again, we ran into people trying to find their way back to the main part of the ship. We won't go back.",Anne S
50,Of Days gone by - The Queen Mary,"The Queen MaryMy partner has visited the Queen Mary many years ago and has reminisced on many occasions and said he would take me to see her. He was making arrangement for our trip from the UK and this is one of the special trips he wanted to visit again. She is a beautiful ship, and as you drive up and park the car, she is there - majestic. We managed to spend most of the day on her, walking around, exploring the different decks, including the engine room. She is eerie and romantic and compelling all in one go. You can just imagine what she was like in her day. There is quite a lot of information to read all around the ship and of course you can do a guided tour. There is a bar/restaurant, which is worth a visit, just to sit and have a drink. Just let your mind wander to what it would have been like in her heyday. We were invited into the communications room by a really nice gentleman, who explained that he was one of many amateur radio enthusiasts who help run the station.There is so much history with this ship and reading the passengers stories makes you smile and some are really sad but true life.We joined Ghosts, myths and legend tour, which was amusing especially for the younger children, being frightened by the darkness and the story being told by the guide, I would like to add that most of the story is myth.There are a number of shops etc for souvenirs and of course it is now a hotel and if the will takes you – you are able to get married on board.If you are into history or just want a taste of a time gone by, you need to visit the Queen Mary.",WelshLady60

40,Great Western Terrier Assoc. All-Terrier Specialty,"This was out first time being on the Queen Mary. Parking across from the ship is very convenient. Check in was quick and easy. Wonderful accommodatins. Shuttling from parking or ship to show ground was very convenient. Accommodations for our dog was great with no hassles and they have a grassy area for our 4 legged family member. Sport Deck, Sun Deck, Promenade Deck all beautiful. The Promenade Cafe and Chelsea Chowder House food was wonderful. The few times we did request room service, we received it in a timely manner.We saw no ghost's, but our dog did like to look under the bed..... What does that tell you?We'll Be Back!!",BarbaraBlairOstrom
30,Worn Grandeur,We were there for a wedding and reception. As others have stated the ship itself is clean but worn looking. The former grandeur is clear from the photos but we were insufficiently impressed by royalty to take any of the onboard tours. The setting was certainly scenic and the hotel's catering service did a good job serving the wedding reception. Parking was easier than expected.,jbz
50,Chance to go back in time and experience history,"Bought combo ticket for sub and ship tour. I love history and probably could have spent an entire day here. Lots of stuff to read about the history of the ship, uses over its life, and how it became a hotel and museum. Being on board this permanently docked ship allows a visitor to feel what it was like to live almost 100 years ago and experience true luxury. Don't miss this sight!!",GeeJAre
50,Dining with the Spirits is ghostly fun,"This is a great attraction to attend. First you enjoy a three-course dinner on board at Sir Winston's Pub and then the you will go on a two hour tour of all the ghostly hotspots of the ship. Make sure you bring a flashlight, fresh batteries and any ghost hunting devices you have. There will be a lot of walking but it's worth it.",mjbncc1701
40,Nifty piece of history...,"Go check out this old school cruise ship. Keep in mind you need to pay go to on. It's not cheap, probably about $25 per person, but you can also buy a combo package for the ship plus the aquarium.",LarBearSSF-CA
40,Interesting visit.,"I enjoyed looking through the parts of the ship we had access to - the glimpses of splendor were tantalizing. However, some areas were closed off and there were no cabins we could see into so it was not possible to get an idea of what the accommodation was like.The ""Diana's Legacy"" was very interesting and showed an excellent summary of the royal family since George V. The exhibition was very well done and it was good to see it follow through to the present day. I was surprised at how much material has been collected by local people and appreciated their making it available for the exhibition. Being from NZ, I am very familiar with the history but it was the detail in this exhibition I enjoyed.We had lunch in one of the restaurants - good food and wonderful views.",SueBye
40,Ok Been there before,"So yes I have been on the Queen Mary previously, but that was in 1952 sailing from the US to France and then back again. So to be honest, not a whole lot of that trip still lingers in my memory. So when my son offered to meet me there to practice a little photography, I was in. First of all, the location is easy to reach as long as one pays attention to the road signs along the 710, and even at the end of the journey, enough folks have made the wrong turn that the city has a very easy correction back to the parking lot.So she does need some exterior paint, a little rust is showing, but once on board, the self guided tour is pretty easy. Many signs around the ship to let one know the area you are visiting. Many Ghost sighting signs. Seems the Queen has a very busy spirit life on board. Do give yourself several hours. There is a ton to see. Do not miss the museum. Really a treat. This is a real treat for anyone who enjoys history.",mitch w
40,So much fun aboard the Queen Mary--DON'T take kids on the Ghost Tour!,"I was so excited to take a tour aboard the Queen Mary and mark something off of my 'bucket list'. The Queen Mary didn't disappoint--I truly appreciated being able to walk at my leisure and read about the history of this great ship. I bought tickets for all five of us to take the 'Ghost Tour', not realizing that it would involve lights and sounds, and mist, et al. The kids were scared to death and had to be taken out nearly immediately. I wasted enough money on four tickets that I was truly miffed that they didn't have a warning on it. Bad business! But that's how they get you, isn't it? I again, would have preferred to meander around without the whole LucasFilm effects and spent time in the Boiler Room and First Class Pool area on my own.Lunch at the Promenade Cafe was uneventful. Not good, not bad, decent food, not too high of prices, but the staff was pretty blase.Great to meander around and really take your time. If at all possible, leave the kiddies who tend to get bored easily at home as there isn't a ton for them to do there. I would love to stay at the hotel on board sometime, with just the hubs!",Hannahbears_mom
50,A Royal Exhibit About Princess Diana,"The Queen Mary is currently hosting a superb exhibit of over 2000 items about the royal family and particularly Princess Diana. While at first I thought the entry fee a bit pricey, I found the exhibit to be outstanding and a thorough examination of the royal family in the 20th century. I was particularly impressed with Prince Charles' beautiful watercolor paintings. Of course, the remarkable life of ""the people's princess"" was highlighted including many family photos, letters, personal effects, and her beautiful ball gowns, most of which were sold to raise money for her many philanthropies and charities. This exhibit raises money for breast cancer. There is a lot of reading involved...and standing...so plan at least two or three hours. The exhibit is very tasteful and does not dwell to much on Camilla. Not for young children. One may also take a self guided tour of the ship with this entry fee.",Christie C
30,Don't do the ghost tour with kids!,"First, the Queen Mary is massive. We had purchased tickets as a combo at the aquarium. Note that, even though you purchase a combo ticket there, you still need to turn it in at the ticket office at the Queen Mary. We didn't do this, and a friendly staff member saw that the line was really long, so told us to go to Guest Services. The woman at guest services, who was on the phone, didn't acknowledge us for about 10 minutes while she wrapped up her call. When she did, and we explained the situation, she was obviously annoyed that someone directed us to her. She asked if the person we spoke with was ""in uniform"" as if we were lying. After the fuss, it took her about 2 minutes to fix the issue. Fine.Went to the self-guided tour, which was confusing. The nice staff memeber at the entrance explained it, but my husband and I, who are fairly intelligent people, still couldn't figure out where to go. So, we decided to wander around until the Ghost Tour, which was included in our ticket. We had asked 2 different workers if the Ghost Tour was appropriate for a 7-year old, and they assured us that he'd be fine. Um - no. After a 5- minute movie, you enter a heavy steel door that has fake smoke rising out of it through a really dark hallway that leads you to the 1st class pool. The pool itself is creepy looking, but they turn out the lights and proceed with a scary light-effect, smoke-effect segment. At that point, before my 7-year old's dreams became any worse than they probably would already be, we found the guide who showed us the way out.Overall, my husband and I enjoyed walking around the ship and looking at the historical aspects of the ship. It was really cool. Not sure our son appreciated it, but we did.",Runwaychic
30,Interesting attraction but too bad the staff is so rude.,We picked the $25 self guided tour and found out later that you have pay an extra $3 for headsets. The staff here are brutal. Didn't meet one nice person.,Jcherewick

40,"Overpriced, but Unique","Was not your run of the mill tourist attraction so was very cool for my 14 yo and 11 yo to tour. Learned a lot, very interesting. We highly recommend taking a tour. We walked around on our own and got lost several times. We also missed out on a lot of good stories I'm sure! Start with the boiler room as that has all the basic info. My only complaint would be the cost. About $25pp, $14 for 11 and under. And on top of admission cost, they add a service fee! What?! How could they rationalize a service fee at their own ticket office? And then you are forced to pay $15 for parking. An expensive day for a family, but one of those things you need to see...once!",beavair
40,Ghost tour and Guide were excellent,"We attended the dining with the Spirits Dinner and Ghost tour. Our guide, Thomas was extremely knowledgable about the history of the ship and made the tour exciting. We spent time in the boiler room and areas of the ship not normally accessed. It was an amazing treat! Thomas is a gem and the ship is lucky to have him as a guide. The fun we had on the tour made up for the rude and lazy person that was sitting in the ticket booth in the parking lot. We forgot our confirmation number at the hotel and she said she could not get uis checked in. We had to give her ideas as the how to find us in the computer. We suggested our e-mail address and she found our reservation. This occurred this past Friday morning about 1130 am. There was not even anyone else in line. We were thankful that that the rest of the staff on the ship were great.",HappyHourHound
30,Didn't blow me away,"When you've heard of something all of your life, you build up great expectations. I had visions of grandeur for this. It was interesting but not what I'd built it up to be. There's a big emphasis on the whole haunted angle, which says to me that there's not much else to sell.",Jane S
30,"A great monument staffed by irritated, disinterested people","This was my first visit to the Queen Mary. The ship is spectacular and fascinating. We bought the the cheapest ticket option that was still very pricey -- $25 per adult, which means anyone 12 and over. We had a ""self-guided tour."" I tried to ask several people, including the people in the hotel lobby behind the information desk how to begin the tour. They seemed irritated about the fact that I couldn't figure it out. One fellow was very impatient for me to tell him if I planned to take the stairs or the elevator before he would give me any information. I didn't know because I didn't know where to start the tour. We got into a little stand-off about it until I finally blurted ""elevator."" Then he VERY quickly told me how to get to the museum on the first floor. It involved getting off the elevator on one level and taking the stairs to the next. I asked him if I could take the elevator to the lower level and he simply reiterated the exact same spiel, just as fast. I asked someone else where people usually started the self-guided tours and she literally didn't know. Too bad because the ship has so very much to offer.",greenlagoon200
50,What a beauty!,"Definately worth the trek down to Long Beach. There is plenty to see and do aboard this ship. The Ghosts and Legends Tour is a fun and scary interactive tour that gets you deep into the ship. You get to see the old swimming pool, boiling room and bow of the ship, very cool indeed. The Princess Diana exhibition is worth a look if your into th Royals, which I am, so was interesting seeing the personal letters and clothing etc. If your out at night down that way...watch for racoons, :) I had no clue they were around until we saw one after dark, lol.",Petina K
30,Cost a lot,"We booked our table for 2, for Tea on the Queen Mary before we left the UK. we knew it would cost, $40 each. We arrived early as we drove from Hollywood Boulevard, and arrived at 12.30. we asked at the paying desk could we board early to have a look around, that would of cost us another $20 each as when you go for tea you only see the tea room and then you have to get off and then there was parking we would of only got 3 hours parking whilst we were in the tea room and our table was at 4.00 and at another £15.00 it was going to be a very expensive tea. We had tea at the burj in Dubai and it came in a lot cheaper. But we saw it and it was nice, did not go for tea in the end we saved our money.",KiRo
50,Wonderful History,We did the ghost tour and it was very interesting walking around the bowels of this very grand old ship.,CoralSt
50,Fascinating Stay,"I had no idea that the Queen Mary had so much history, it is really an amazing story. My son, wife and I stayed the night and it was a great time for all of us. As far as the tours go, they have some ""special effects"" tours that didn't sound appealing to me, but the Twilight Tour was very entertaining and full of historical information as well as ghost stories.I was there for the haunted experience and all I can say is that we were not dissapointed, if you do a little exploration on your own you will have a great time.",Robert B
40,"Very good, entrance needs a make-over and catering flaws","Having last seen the QM in the 'sixties in southampton I was not sure what to expect.Overall, the interior is still a superb piece of Art Deco writ large and worth even a long pilgrimage to see it.The quayside ticket-selling area needs a big makeover and an intro video room or video wall would not go amiss. My hand-annotated ship plan was wrongly marked and I went to a closed entry tower. The real entrance seems to be shared with the hotel entrance - all messy and confusing with too many people in too small a space waiting for a small lift.Good points: Full set of original room settings, floors, walls and period lights and wall artwork. On-board shops sympathetically inserted into the original small shop units. Good quality items for sale including nice sets of images of the artwork on the walls. Catering units are also sympathetically inserted into original or plausibly refashioned spaces. Even the Starbucks sign is suitably discreet. Period room settings like the nursery are superb time capsules to look at. The hotel spaces I expected to be out of bounds but like a land hotel you can wander into the foyer and enjoy the public spaces as it were.Watch out for: The catering units keep different and odd hours all under-advertised unfortunately. I missed Afternoon Tea which stopped (not started!) at 4pm in one saloon and missed the poorly-advertised brunch in the fantastic First Class Dining Room by ten minutes. Catering times need advertising all in one place as you board please.Weird moments. I found a Starboard Promenade deck restaurant and waited to be seated. I woud like to think I got a seaview table set for six,on my own, because I turned up in a jacket and collared shirt. The milkshake-guzzling family of six in minimal beach wear behind me were put in a corner. A dress code to get on board? Surely not.Get the entrance areas and catering times sorted and earn 5 stars. And repaint the funnels.ps The Royal Family timeline on one wall is the oddest family tree I ever saw.",Stephen J
20,I Didn't Know What I Payed For!,"I went to the Queen Mary with high expectations. I really like ghosts and paranormal activity so I decided to take the Ghosts and Legends tour. First of all, I did not know it was actually a very fabricated haunted house. I expected it to be more of a historical and learning experience. Instead, I got a tour guide who poorly acted pretending that ""everything was going wrong"" and a poor haunted house with loud special effects and music that just took away all the mystery of the ship. Many visitors had small children and had to leave 5 mins into the tour because it was terrifying for them. They modified too much with the walls covered in ""bloody"" writing and the lights and special effects inside the piping. I was more satisfied with looking at informative signs and untouched original displays of beds and silverware. The Ghosts and Legends tour was a tourist trap. Try the Princess tour or anything except that. It was a huge waste of money. Although the ship was historical and fun to look at, the price was too much at $25 (with $1.75 service charge). The parking we also found out, was too expensive and from a information booth we found that parking at the aquarium was a better deal then taking the free bus to the ship itself. However, I do not recommend taking the Ghost tour. The ship was cool, but get a package worth your money!",123SamGirl
50,Excellent Time on the Queen Mary,"Knowing I was onboard a ship that carried famous passengers such as Clark Gable, Winston Churchill, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Bob Hope, Fred Astaire, etc., was amazing.

40,Art Deco elegance afloat,"We recently stayed on the Queen Mary for the 2nd time in about 10 years and it is a beautiful ship. Now converted into a hotel and moored at Long Beach (about 30 mins from Downtown LA) you can stay in the cabins, or a suite, or - as we did - a mini-suite. These are not as big as hotel rooms and suites tend to be, and because the owners have retained many of the original fixtures and fittings, don't expect state-of-the-art bathrooms (mine had a cracked sink and the lavatory took a couple of minutes to flush properly). However, this does make the experience more authentic and thankfully, they haven't gutted the cabins and made them into bland, identikit, standard hotel rooms. I particularly liked the 4 taps above the bath, 2 of them offering hot and cold seawater! (these don't actually work anymore). The public areas are well-maintained and elegant, particularly the Grand Salon (formerly the first class dining room) where you can attend a ""brunch"" every Sunday, with good buffet food, ice sculptures and a lady harpist. The Observation Bar overlooking the bow (that's the pointy end) is a splendid art deco composition and a good place to relax with a cocktail or two, although the management have spoilt it by trying to turn it into a ""sports bar"" with two large TV screens which are always on, but nobody watches. The ship has restaurants, a gym, shops and you can take a number of tours, ranging from historical tours to the inevitable ""ghost tours"". There is also a Princess Diana exhibition which is very well done. Some staff were very helpful and knowledgeable, but most were a bit vacant and indifferent. Now for the niggles: when we arrived from the airport after a 9 hour flight and car journey, we had to queue for the lifts to get aboard the ship, as a there had been a hideous ""BBQ"" event on the quayside and many of those attending were trying to get aboard to go to the bar. Guests are not fast-tracked onto the ship, which is appalling - surely one lift should be set aside for guests arriving/ departing? When we eventually checked in, we were told that our cabin was not ready (at 4.30pm), even though we had received emails saying it was ready. We therefore had to sit in the Observation Bar, still in our travel clothes, surrounded by the sweaty, badly-dressed grockels until our cabin was ready. Horrid. The Queen Mary really needs to impose and enforce a minimum dress code for the Observation Bar and certainly the Sunday brunch in the Grand Salon, where people were turning up in beach-wear (flip-flops, cargo shorts, women with their arms uncovered). Added to which, in spite of having purchased timed tickets for the Sunday brunch, we still had to queue, giving us no priority over casual ""walk-in"" customers. Pointless. However, once the grockels had departed, we and the other guests had the ship to ourselves which was lovely and it's a great place to explore. A must-see attraction if you're holidaying in LA, but if you do decide to stay aboard, it's best midweek to avoid the sweaty ""Simpson"" families and poor customer service.",Diesel B
50,A taste of elegance,I love the ambience of a great sailing ship while enjoying a succulent brunch. The ghost stories add fun and mystery to any experience.,RUQAYYAH C
40,A bit emotional for me,"My dad, for the second time, came to Canada via New York on the Queen Mary in 1951 so going on board the Queen was kind of nostalgic for me. I have pictures of him on the ship but I did not find the locations.As most of you know the Queen Is now a hotel but you can purchase tours. The cheapest is $19.95 which includes a self guided and if you sign up also includes a guided tour. As we had to wait 3 hours for the guided tour we just did it ""self"". The ship is not in good condition on the outside. The lifeboats need repair as the paint is peeling and in some cases the wood is rotting. You can go from the bow to the stern but it's a little like a maze and may take you a bit of searching to accomplish. You can also visit the bridge which I found interesting. If you are planning on doing the ""Titanic"" thing of spreading your arms while leaning over the bow, forgetaboutit! There is a closed compartment at the bow. Don't forget to do the engine room as it's a different entrance on to the ship. Just ask they will tell you how to get there. The interior is the ship is well kept and reflects ""the way it was"". In no way does this compare to the modern cruise ships of today but that is a good thing. This tour is something you do once. Put it on your bucket list. I'm sure you will enjoy it if you like history.",Laceyp
50,A wonderful way to spend an afternoon,"Teh ship itself is amazing, and the self guided audio tour lets you explire it at a leisurely pace. There are several palces to eat, everything from a Starbucks to some nice dining options. The lounge had good drinks and appetizeres at fair prices as well. Lots of little shops on the Promenade and there are also facilities for private parties available. The hotel looked quite intersting, and in talking with a couple who had spent two onights ther it was quite comfortable. We also took the ""Ghost Tour"" which was some great cheesy fun.",Michael M
10,Gross,"I had been looking forward to seeing the ship since I was kid and wow, what a disappointment! Stood in long line to buy a ticket and then got lost with several others, due to no signage or staff. The one staff we did talk to was not welcoming or really helpful. With parking it was around $115 bucks for our family of four. It smelled moldy and looked like it hadn't had a dusting in years. They ran out of audio tour equipment by the time we got there at 10. Told us to keep checking back and maybe they would have some. The restaurants were not inviting. There were areas where I was afraid my husband would fall through the patch job on the floor. It was just sad. It needs some deep pockets and someone that knows how to handle a tourist attraction to get it where it needs to be. I will say the ladies bathroom was the nicest room I went in. Very clean, not so scary.",Liz C
10,Incredibly Bad,"Literally just back from visiting and what an incredible disappointment. A transportation nerd, I was looking forward to exploring this beauty. However, you see so very little since the owners turned into a shopping mall/hotel/full of restaurants. Almost all the public areas are shuttered or with recreated furniture, or a modern tee-shirt emporium (seriously).I spent an hour here and worst of all the cheapest entry is $25, they have the nerve to charge a $1.75 fee bought on all tickets at their window and then parking over one hour is a flat $15, so yes $40 for a hour to spent a mall/old ship. The line to buy tickets took 15 minutes due to one person working, which then put me over an hour of parking.There is no staff anywhere onboard to answer questions and little signage so you can't know about what you are seeing, find your way around or enjoy it.I though other reviewers just didn't want to enjoy an old ship, but I should have listed. What a terrible and incredible waste of money and time.",PlateMan
30,"Could have been better, but a walk into history...","After taking a a road trip into California, the Queen Mary was something that I had been trying to visit for many years. I finally, with some planning, was able to stop into Long Beach for a visit. Be prepared for a somewhat expensive ""Walk threw history""....Everything about the day seemed to be a ""cash grab"", starting with the parking, and there is no alternative.Tickets to get on-board are pricey as well, and the audio tour, although was very interesting.....was a very confusing endeavour, as it is not laid out in order anymore, and is very confusing to actually find your way around the ship in any specific order.When asking about the actual layout for the audio tour, the rep. just told us to wander around the ship and and choose areas for the audio tour.The ship, from a completely different era, is worth the visit, if you enjoy a look into the fabulous art deco past, but bring the money.",drkayotica
40,Interesting for adults,"I'd skip this tour if you have young kids, they'd be board, but for adults it's very nice. Basic price is almost $30. We were on the Carnival cruise leaving that day so we got to tour for free, just checked in early for our cruise and showed our sail and sign card. Wish we could have taken the haunted tour, but the times didn't gel with when we were there.",Avondaletraveler
30,A little expensive to what you're going to see,"we went on an afternoon, we walked and explored the ship, took pictures, and we went to grab a bite, the restaurant that is on the ship is expensive so we went to the cafe that serves starbucks coffee, and we couldn't eat because the sandwiches have no labels, so basically you don't know what you are going to eat, so we left and found the tea room on the ship, delicious food.Bottom line: a nice place to spend the afternoon and eat, but i think the tickets are overly priced for what they are offering to see.",HD76HD76
40,Nostalgia,I simply like huge cruise ships and this one has definitely its own charisma and charm. You can also book private events there or stay a night. Great view onto the Long Beach city skype from there.,RGerman
40,Nice attraction to visit,"Visiting the Queen Mary was a great way to spend a couple of hours. I did get a little claustrophobic when venturing into the bottom of the ship, but enjoyed the upper sections and the cute retro gift shops on board. It was definitely a must see item during my trip to Long Beach.",yincaro
50,Tea at the Queen Mary,"My best friend and I celebrate birthdays and holidays with sharing high tea. The Windsor tea service at the Queen Mary is excellent! The tea sandwiches are unique and extremely flavorful. Two different types of scones are included - both terrific, And the dessert selection is wonderful. The room is elegant. The china and linens are beautiful. The staff are great - a perfect mix between attentiveness and space. Thank you to our server Elizabeth who absolutely made my friend's birthday! Hands down one of the best teas we have found in Southern California.",AmyS419
40,What a cool experience,"This is a must do while in Long beach. It,s not cheap but it's a walk through it he past and a great way to spend the day. the ghost tour was awesome. The whole experience was fun and I certainly plan on going back.it was too big to see it all in the time we had. I would also recommend seeing the Russian sub while you are there.",4minuu
40,Queen Mary twilight tour,"We took the twilight tour, which brought us into depths of this grand old ship that has such rich history. $27.50 for two people is a bargain compared to other attractions, and well worth the price. However, the parking was rather pricey - $15.",ChiGuy65
50,GRAND OLD LADY STILL GREAT TO TOUR,"I was staying @ a great hotel next door to the Queen Mary with a business client, and we decided to check out the floating hotel, and legendary Ocean Liner, The Queen Mary. We had a blast! You buy a $15 coupon each, which are redeemable for amongst other things.....cocktails and beer at the 3 convenient bars located within this magnificent old ship. A lot of the décor is the original Art Deco stuff from the 1930's.....so sitting at these old original bars you feel like Jack Nicolson in the movie The Shining when he's being served by ghost bartenders.....except these bartenders were friendly and personable.Oh yeah, there's also a Russian submarine there onsite to explore if you get tired of the Queen Mary.",ThriftyCanuck
40,Better than expected for price,We went on the tour and ghost and legends tour. First off we got an over 55 discount which I hadn't seen advertised. The ghost tour was amusing as well as interesting led by an aspiring actor. People don't bother with the audio for the self guided tour as it only narrates what you can read. Overall we spent about 2 1/2 hrs on the ship looking around. The hotel staff were happy to show us a cabin being used as a hotel room as well,rickandcarole01
40,Interesting ship,Went to a convention there and spent the night. Nice cramped ship cabins give feel of ocean liner. Tour of ship very interesting and has historic value.,Arnold V
40,Loved the ship - but not the Ghost tour,"My account may be a little biased as one of my great interests is the history of the North-Atlantic liner service between Southampton and New York. The Queen Mary fits that bill and was a ""must-see"" for me on my trip to Los Angeles.Long Beach is a train trip of just over an hour from Hollywood. You will read many reports on the internet of incidents occurring on the Blue Line between LA and Long Beach. I went on a Sunday and had absolutely no problems in either direction. It was actually an enjoyable trip. From the train the ""suspect"" suburbs looked clean and neat. The train was also clean.If you go by train you alight at Transit Mall station. Just around the corner (at Pine and 1st) you catch the Passport C shuttle bus to the Queen Mary. It is FREE. The shuttle bus is quite regular (every 7-10 minutes.)I did the self-guided tour. I wasn't provided with a tour map but I had one that I'd found on the internet. I also didn't use the audio guide as I was really more interested in taking photos and video so I can't comment on its quality. You have access to most parts of the ship including the engine room, bridge and decks. Function rooms and staterooms are not accessible.I also did the Ghost tour. I found it to be rather dull and inane and only did it to get access to parts of the ship that weren't available on the self-guided tour, such as the 1st Class swimming pool. Unfortunately for those wishing to take photos on the Ghost tour, don't bother. The whole tour is carried out under very low light levels. I don't think it was worth the money.The ship itself is great. To see such a magnificent (although unfortunately worse for wear) example of a Blue Riband winning liner from the early part of the 20th Century was pure nostalgia and certainly, for me, worth the visit.Pros- free shuttle bus from train station to Queen Mary.- good views from Shoreline Village- access to many parts of the ship- food available on board- gift shop for Queen Mary souvenirs- no restrictions on photo or video taking- you get to see one of the iconic ships of our time- there are plenty of tour aboard- you can even stay on board (it is a hotel)Cons- self-guided tour involves use of stairs as does the Ghost tour- you may become a little lost finding your way around. It is a big ship.- certain rooms may be off limits if there are functions occurringTips- I would suggest getting off at Stop C (Shoreline Village) first for a great side view of the ship.- Make sure you ask for a tour map at the ticket desk. I bought my ticket online and didn't get a map because I bypassed the ticket office. You can download one here (as at May 2013)www.cruisemates.com/images/QMlongbeach/selfguidedtour.jpgFor tickets and information go towww.queenmary.comBy the way, my ranking of 4 was an average of 5 for the ship and 3 for the Ghost tour.",Roddlez
50,Queen Mary Ghosts and Legends Tour,"We did the Queen Mary Ghosts and Legends Tour after a really great 28 day cruise with Princess to Hawaii and the South Pacific. The QM is moored permanently at Long Beach and also has a hotel and conference centre. It was really, really good. We got on board about 1030, everyone was exceptionally helpful and told us many times “ thank you for visiting us” We really felt they meant it. The tour we were on only had about a dozen guests and 2 staff, one is to take you out if its too much, and it does get really dark and you may find it a bit much if you suffer from claustrophobia. We visited the first class swimming pool ( haunted ) the boiler room ( really creepy ) the engine room and the bow where the QM collided with a destroyer in WW2. In all honestly it’s a bit like Calamity Canyon at Disney but done much, much better. The 2 guides who accompanied us were terrific, unfortunately we cant remember their names but if they read this and remember us !!!! Thanks for a really great time.The actual tour lasts about 40 minutes or so. We then spent a further couple of hours exploring on our own. One thing we did visit was the propeller box, its unbelievably spooky………….We had just finished a cruise on Star Princess and the technology gap was astonishing. Quite often we both mentioned that we could have been on the Titanic and it was NOTHING like modern cruise liners. Talking to another member of staff they told us flat out the QM could do 36 knots, really impressive when Star Princess could do 22.5. Thundering along in the middle of a North Atlantic gale at full speed must have been awesome, which I’d been on it ( Mrs Kentish Traveller disagrees!!!! ) The time went all too quickly but we really enjoyed out visit. We would certainly stay on board on a future visit.Where there any downsides, no apart from a really gross “English Village” opposite. Nothing like ANY English village we ever visited !!!!",KentishTravellers
40,"Expected to be disappointed, but was pleasantly surprised","I almost didn't stay here due to all the negative reviews. I honestly have no idea what these people are talking about. First, our room had two twin beds which were incredibly comfortable. The room was quite large and quite clean. It is a very old ship, so, yes, there were a few cracks in the walls. But no flaking paint and everything worked fine.The rest of the ship was also clean and all the staff we encountered were quite friendly and helpful. Food in the dining room was just OK.We were here with a group of 24 ""amateur"" ghost hunters, led by Barry Fitzgerald from GHI. So when we took the ghost tour at night we were taken to some areas that most are not privy to. Our tour guide was quite friendly and seemed to love his job. Our tour was almost 4 hours long because he kept wanting to show us different areas not on the tour. We did have some interesting experiences, but spirits don't tend to show up when there is a large group of people. Most experiences people have are when there aren't as many people. Don't know why. There were a couple people in our group that had personal experiences in their rooms. Nothing scary, just unexplainable.The only thing I think you may need to watch out for is they do rent out some of their main rooms for public events. When we were there, one of the local high schools was having their prom there. We heard many people complaining about the noise. The staff did everything they could to accommodate them, including switching rooms and giving out ear plugs. This could certainly dampen someones experience. Try to get a room that is far from the event rooms. The walls are thin, so bring earplugs or a white noise machine to block out sounds if you're a light sleeper.Overall, I did NOT find the Queen Mary to be dirty or falling apart. In fact I thought it looked fantastic for it's age. I also didn't find the staff to be rude and indifferent at all. If you're incredibly picky then this place may not be for you. But all of us in our group were very happy with our experiences, our rooms, the staff and the ship. It really is beautiful. Even if you don't stay here, it's worth walking around. It's like going back in time.",Cassie H
40,Fun visit to a historic time,A great tourist attraction especially for people who remember this ship and her history. Take a tour and enjoy.,Fisherwoman4
40,Lovely day in a busy city.,"My husband wanted the submarine and World war 2 tour and I opted for the Diana exhibition, but the ticket office insisted we wouldn't be able to link up again so we went for Diana which was a bit cheaper as well. The exhibition was more the Royal family going back to the queen mothers days, and very interesting. The ship is lovely, mostly on the top deck, as the ones below are hotel rooms and a function suite (the old dining room) beautiful Art Deco decor, from the 1st class bar to children's crèche, the bridge , views across the bay etc. could have had afternoon tea, which might have been nice as well. We spent a few hours there finishing with a drink in the bar with a lovely view.managed to peep around a maintenance man and see into a hotel room. They looked fine but trip advisor says can be noisy so opted for a land based hotel. Allin all I think we'll worth a visit.",Trish.UK
30,Only if you have nothing else to do....,"First (and last) trip to Long Beach necessitated a trip to the local landmark, The Queen Mary. Different prices for levels of access to things on the ship. Not inexpensive. Found myself asking ""Is that all there is?"" at the conclusion of our self guided tour. There were not enough head sets for visitors and it certainly wasn't crowded. Disappointing.",graymar6
40,Dinner and lunch on The QM,"Dinner in the Sir Winston was very good and the price reflected it. It is an addition to the ship and so is not an authentic space of the liner. Lunch was in the seafood restaurant on the old starboard promenade deck. It was the first time lunch was served and it was really pretty bad, especially for the price. There is no reason why it may not improve with time.",Albert H
20,NOT worth the money - just say you're checking into the hotel!,"We just got back from a trip to Long Beach. Of course, everyone told us we ""had"" to do the Queen Mary. First off the pricing was ridiculous. I'm not naive, I understand tourist traps are pricey - but this was crazy. The most budget friendly was $24.95+tax. Which included access to the ship, the self guided audio tour and the Ghost Explore/Tour. First we were sent to the 4th level when we should've been sent to the 2nd to get our audio set. The directions on the ship were terrible, we couldn't even find WHERE to get the audio set because it was so out of the way. Also - the audio set was outdated and we were told not to go 'in order' just to go level by level and that this number and that number didn't exist. Then we did our ghost tour. While the guides were very good at what they did we couldn't hear them half of the time because the sound effects were so loud. As well it was so dark you couldn't see anything. I highly recommend that if you're doing this attraction you just say you're checking into the hotel and go browse around for free.",dubshan22
40,A little tired but still a grand old lady,"We only spent one night on this wonderful piece of history following a week's cruise up the coast of California. The style of the two ships couldn't have been more different. The Sapphire Princess, newly refitted, had very possible amenity and although very ""swish"", sometimes seemed a little brash in places. The Queen Mary, although a little tired and faded in places just oozed class. The Art Deco period details are still spectacular, the polished wood and mirrors are preserved in a time capsule. Yes, more could be done to restore everything to its former glory but I loved everything about it. Our cabin was well appointed with a superb bathroom, very much in keeping with the period and the bed was sooo comfy! Room service was disappointing, I wanted tea and toast and was offered hot chocolate and bread and butter instead. However, the Sunday brunch more than made up for any other shortcomings. The food, both in terms or variety and quality was superb and the service was faultless. Our champagne glasses were never allowed to empty and the waiters were charming, chatty friendly and amusing. I'd love to go back, if only to do the tour and see everything I missed!",414jackieb
10,What a disappointment,"We were looking forward to seeing this grand old ship. When we picked up the headsets the guy told us they would not be much use to us as the narration was out of date. we found the instructions to find our way round the ship confusing. On mentioning this to a crew member we were told ""everyone does""We had hoped to see some of the glamour of cruising in the 30's but instead everywhere was dirty and jadedAdded to our disappointment, after paying to get into the exhibition, we were then charged 15dollars for around 1.5 hrs stay in the car park",R064
50,Sunday Brunch,"We had the champagne brunch on the first Sunday of our trip, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere, service and food quality were top notch. The champagne glass never was allowed to empty, lines were not a problem, and the harp player added a wonderful touch to the meal. The food was fresh, and there was a great variety. The seafood and dessert sections were my favorite, but there were a variety of Asian, Mexican and breakfast dishes too. We enjoyed the walk around the ship afterward.",amgood16
30,Getting a little tired but worth a visit,"Well, it's a big ship. It's worth a visit but it is getting a little tired. The upkeep must be enormous..brass to polish..woodwork to wax..i'm sure it costs a fortune..but they should spend a little more on it to bring it back to it's former glory.",5starry
50,The Old Queen Still Quite Grand !!,"Take the Tour and check out this Legend, its so Grand even from a distance !Leave at least 2-3 hours or more to visit, and it will bring you back to the good old daysof sea voyage. DO NOT Forget you camera, even if you do not board and take the tour,you can park and take pictures up close.you can also visit a Soviet era Sub next to the Queen, sub tickets extra.The city of Long Beach is Beautiful, lots of places to eat in ALL Price range close by.Plenty of things to do with in walking distance, starting on Ocean ave,do not miss this area, 30 min to LAX, Close enough to drive to Hollywood, Beverly Hills and all so california Attractions.",Ritchie H
40,If you like cruise ships it's worth it,Interesting to see how people cruised 50-plus years ago. It took me about an hour to go through the ship - but I'm fast.,BobZAtlanta_Ga
50,Bringing History to Life: My Teen Loved It,"We didn't want to leave! We were drawn in by the beauty, magnitude, accessibility and, of course the ghosts. My 13 year old loved the ship. We spent the day on board poking all around the ship from stem to stern (uh, yeah, I don't think that's right). Anyway, from the top to the bottom and everything in between - and I'm sure some places we were supposed to go.We did participate in the haunted tours - two of them - and they were great. One was for fun but the other had history and made the Queen Mary come alive. The shopping area is beautiful and the wood and glass and details are so amazing. We ended up staying for a light, late dinner and finally tore ourselves away.I don't think I have ever climbed so many stairs - so plan accordingly - but it was so worth it. It's one of the best memories of our trip.Tips: leave yourself plenty of time to just sit and take in the sites. Imagine being a passenger so many years ago. Look at some of the books they have on board to learn more about everything the Queen has been through. I spent a lot of time post-trip reading about her history. Now I want to go back - so a quick read before will likely make your visit even better.Have fun!",JenCarole
50,An Iconic Must-See,"Great attraction whether you're taking the self-guided tour or one of the many guided tours. The ghost and legends tour is a family friendly, short and quirky tour which is included in most admissions. Plenty of great photo ops as well.",Edward Y
50,Amazing Ship!!!,"I wanted to visit the Queen Mary on our last visit to CA, but we ran out of time. This time I was determined to see this amazing ship. You can ask for a free audio tour (which we found about from another visitor) or you can explore the ship on your own. Be sure to visit the engine room way down below the deck. We did The Ghosts & Legends Tour, which is definitely hokey, but got us into seeing the supposedly haunted swimming pool, which was fun. Don't bring young kids on the tour, since it does have loud noises and scary effects. There's a Starbucks on board, and you're allowed to bring your beverage on The Ghosts & Legends Tour, and while touring the ship. This ship is a must see if you're in Long Beach!",Loreen U
20,Waste of time,"Our group of 13 arrived by the free shuttle from the aquarium (across the bay) only to find out that there were not enough audio guides for our group. They begrudgingly gave us 4 (audio guides). The audio guide attendant kept on helping other small groups while she remained paralyzed with our group. Basicly, our group wandered around aimlessly and couldn't believe what a waste of time. At times, we ended walking in and around the hotel area lost. More signs should be placed for the tour. Perhaps, they will see this and next time take better care of larger groups.",Norman D
40,Impressive,"I am a lifelong Southern California resident. Came to the Queen Mary to see the Diana exhibit. I hadn't been here in a long time. Needless to say I was quite impressed with the ship. Brought my mother, who needs handicap accessibility. There are elevators to take you where you want to go. It is a hotel too. Saw quite a number of people staying here. Also a lot of visitors. I would come back. There are a variety of tour options and different restaurants to choose from. Had lunch in The Tea Room. Food was good, reasonably priced and good service. Recommend reservations if you want to sit by a window. It offers experience of being one ship without sailing, which is unique. Feels like the owners have preserved the ship well. There is a submarine next to it, which I didn't get a chance to visit. Overall a good experience. They offer AAAdiscounts, so bring your card. You have to pay for parking, which is $15 for the day.",LsyaB

40,"good experience, good food, good value","Thanks for the tip ""catchmeify00can"". We did what you said, and bought the $15 food vouchers for each of us and took a self-guided tour, seeing what was of interest to us, lingering whenever and where ever we wanted, then ate lunch in the Promenade Cafe. Didn't mind skipping the tours and Princess Di exhibit, but very much liked the ""step back in time"" experience of the luxury liner. Haven't been on a cruise, and I know today's modern liners are gargantuan when compared to the QM, but really liked the simple elegance of what used to be. To be honest, the food was better than ""good"" (as mentioned in my title), especially the banana split! Three hours of quality time in Long Beach. We'll be back.",WildWilliam
30,An Era Gone By But Not Forgotten,"The Queen Mary is an interesting and historical step back into the past when there was a class system in place for cruise passengers. The Grand Ballroom is beautifuI, however she is is a bit shabby and needs a lot of work. It's good for a day outing or to enjoy high tea. The Haunted Encounters Tour was interesting. The restaurant food is mediocre.",JSW842

30,Princess Diana Exhibit,"Very nice collection of items from the royal family history included in exhibit, Was amazed at the amount of history and details included. Gift shop was not over done. Ship itself is amazing it is so large and ornate. Took a peek in the tea room, gorgeous, wish we would have had time to stay. Took a walk around outside, Good view of the ships and port. A bit on the expensive side. Probably wouldn't have done it except we had passes from a Christmas event that allowed us access to ship.",goldrushgal
10,"Dusty, dank dissappointment","We actually asked for our money back after spending 2 hours sneezing through the outdated, dirty, dusty, rundown, mildewed ship. We paid for the audio tour which we did not get until after 45 minutes of wondering through the engine room. Once we started the tour, we were lead up, down, back and forth through the ship with no apparent rhyme or reason, often to exhibits which were no longer open or available to see. The examples of cabins are mock-ups behind glass which have not been attended to since their development with dust covering everything and tarnished silver. The only way to see parts of the ship such as the pool is to take the ""Ghosts and Legends"" tour which is a cheesy, over-acted, guided tour through the ""haunted"" portions of the ship. What a waste of our last day of vacation.",StephieB64
30,rusting palace,"Beautiful left over from another era! to be seen if you never have been on an ocean liner. Still very impressive but as it has been taken over by a hotel where many functions take place every day such as anniversaries,birthdays, etc..the great salons are almost never visible and neither are the cabins.There was an exhibition on, supposedly showing the dresses of Diana; in fact very few were shown but there was an interesting documentation on the royal family, many pictures and even a few dresses of Kate Middleton ,which seemed to be quite popular.",lamaestra78
30,quite disappointing,the best bit was the tea room with the best tea i have tasted in America! bridge level quite interesting - we paid for a Diana exhibition which being British was a bit random mish mash of royal family paper cuttings etc - whereas advertised as her dresses. you cannot get in any staterooms and there was very little to see which truely brought the old cruise ship alive. it cost about $40 too so not that cheap,michelle0404
40,The Queen of Long Beach.,"I've been to the Queen Mary several times. It's a nice way to spend a few hours, but I liked it better in the beginning when it had the ""Living Sea exhibit. I do enjoy touring the ship and the exhibits are nice. The little reproduction English street dockside is quaint, but I wouldn't go for just that. I toured the Russian Sub once and that was interesting . I also enjoy just sitting on the deck watching the ships go by and the view of Long Beach across the harbor.",Kenneth L
20,"Just pay to get on the ship, don't bother with the tours","Paid the premium to get all the tours and what a waste of time and money. It was cool to be able to explore certain parts of the ship, however, a majority of the ship was blocked off for about 75 private functions apparently. Seemed that every corner we went around there was another sign blocking entrances because there was a ""private function"" happening. The self guided audio tour was a joke. Takes you all over the place, up stairs, down stairs from the rear of the ship to the front, u-turn here, climb more stairs there, look left, go there....we finally just started to explore ourselves. Started at the front and moved our way back, being careful not to interrupt the many private functions that were happening...even though we never did stumble upon any sort of function. Seemed to me that there were just your everyday average Joe Shmoe running around, u-turning and climbing stairs wandering aimlessly. So...just pay to get on the ship and explore it yourself. Don't bother to pay for any of the extra tours. One thing I was looking forward to was the Ghost tour but by the time it started we were so annoyed with the self guided audio thing and exhausted from the running from front to back, climbing this stairway and that stairway that we were ready to just leave.",Jamie M
30,I did it my way and had a great time.,"Despite the many poor reviews I was curious. Instead of paying for the Queen Mary tour ($25), we payed $15 each for a dining voucher. This enabled us access to roam the ship and $15 towards food or drink on the ship - a great value and an interesting venue for cocktails with a great pianist. Although the nostalgia of the visit was fun, I have absolutely no interest in staying here as a hotel guest. Enjoy a cocktail or two (premium was $9), stroll the decks and imagine how this ship changed the lives of so many.",SoCal Happy
20,"Queen Mary, looking a little seedy.","Took the grandkids to see the dear old Queen and was a little saddened by the state of her. The first thing that I noticed was that she needed a coat of paint. Granted I had not been for 40 years and I the last time I went it had not been open very long, but I remembered her to be so much more grand.The Princess Diana Dress Exibit was a bit disappointing as a lot of the dresses were in minature on dolls.There was not a tea towel to be had, only some left over from the 2012 Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Afternoon tea was $32 each, forget it!The kids (14 and 16) enjoyed the haunted ship tour. I would like to have heard more about the stories of individuals who died shipboard...The food was appallingly expensive...all in all a bit disappointing",hikerache
40,Disappointing - what areas you do NOT get to see.,"I am a Cruise fanatic. I was in Long Beach specifically to go on a cruise.The Queen Mary is located immediately adjacent to the Long Beach cruise terminal.Despite all the negtives, being able to even BE on this ship is an opportunity of a life time.Go Anyway, despite the negatives and the relatively high cost.Guests need to remember that this is now a working hotel and a series of profit making restaurants. This means that tours will NOT include any of the actual passenger cabins.Nor will you be able to see any of the legendary public spaces, aside from the gift shop area, the first class bar, and the swimming pool (drained) down in the bowels of the ship.If you want to see the interior of a actual cabin, I suggest you stay there overnight. It is particularly handy for departing cruise ship passengers. It is the closest hotel to the terminal, which is conveniently located right across the parking lot.For guests staying on the ship, the City of Long Beach offers a FREE ""red shuttle bus"" which stops at the Queen Mary, about every fifteen minutes a bus makes a loop through all of the major tourist areas,including the aquarium and all of the restaurants downtown.Guests pay about $25.00 to see the bridge, the officers cabins, endless outside decks, and the hospital quaranteen area. Do not expect to see a pristine historical relic, the ship has had what appears to be minimal routine care in the fourty odd years it has sat in Long Beach.For those of you seeking a ""gentile experience"" tak afternoon tea on the ship. Yes it is a bit expensive, but this is one of THE experience soyu will remember about your time in Long Beach.",Kelly B
20,Not What It Used To Be,"Very Run Down, self-guided tours are very difficult to follow and really pointless to go on.There was an exhibition displaying Princess Dianna’s dresses and other articles.",Forwarder
30,Expensive for what you get,"I took a day out of my schedule to go on this tour as my mother had sailed on this ship in it's day. I bought the basic ticket which was $24.95 and with an AAA discount$20. The ghost tour I felt was good, but the bottom of the ship was moldy and I would not suggest to anyone with asthma. I ate in the restaurant on the ship and the service and food were good for the value. I felt that the girls who worked the check in at the Ghost tour, were rude! Everyone that approached with a question, they gave an attitude to. Both of them should be fired to give the rest of the staff a better reputation. Everyone else was nice, but these two were awful. I was there on March 13th at around 10 AM for an 11 AM tour I believe. Stopped into the Scottish shop and this guy was rude as well. I wanted a magnetic bumper sticker and when I asked if they had one, he was said no and quickly moved to another customer not offering any alternatives. Lots of walking and up and down stairs. I heard several older people complaining about that and I felt it later in the evening. Parking was $15, but I ate in the restaurant and found out if you were there for under 3 hours, they discounted the parking with a meal, so I bolted early to make sure i got the discount. It was $10 off. If I had paid $25 for adminission and $15 for parking for this ""adventure"" I would have been ripped off.",Robert M
50,Non Cruise Cruise,"The boat is a timeless wonder. So Art Deco, so functionally beautiful and parked in a lively area with lots to offer. I even sort of liked the fire alarm at 7:30 am.

50,"Diana, Legacy of a Princess Exhibit","The Queen Mary showcased a collection of evening gowns, personal accessories, photographs, heirlooms and memorabilia associated with Princess Diana and the Royal Family. With my PBS membership I was able to get 50% off the tickets which was well worth the price.I was fortunate to see Diana's collection of dresses at Kensington Palace ten years ago and the price was much more, although just as good. There were so many original newspaper clippings that highlighted the different Kings, Queens, and princesses that the self tour took close to 2 hours, because I do love reading about the history and events of the day. It's less than that if you're not much of a reader or history buff.Next to the exhibit is the Tea Room and the menu is excellent. One of us had a salad, the other a sandwich and both were presented well, excellent taste, and of a good portion. The tea was outstanding and made for a nice afternoon of relaxing and viewing the Long Beach skyline. Wait staff are very attentive.",Monica
10,"""Supernatural"" ghost tour not super","The ship has a wonderful history, especially with it's service to the Allies in WWII, but has now been in harbor at Long Beach longer than she sailed. The Ghost Tour was gimmicky and boring. The interior of the ship is dilapidated and dirty. The tour guide was less than enthusiastic and the high school group I was with lost interest quickly. We had group pre-purchased tickets so I can't speak to the value. It might be more interesting to go look around the ship on your own and enjoy a meal in one of the restaurants.",BCSunflower777
50,Excellent tourist attraction for history buffs,"There is a little for everyone on the QM. I enjoyed the self guided tour, the stores, the forward lounge, and a couple of the guided tours. It is also a great place for people watching. You will recognize the facilities from a number of reality shows like Face Off.",Techkraut
50,Princess Diana Exhibit -- It's so much more than just Diana!,"DESPITE FEEDBACK, I'M GLAD I WENTI had been hesitant to see this exhibit as reviews and feedback from friends was so-so. When my mom mentioned a group bus-trip to see it, I decided to go. I'm really glad I did!IT'S MORE THAN JUST ABOUT DIANAThe museum is really doing itself and the public a disservice by calling this a 'Princess Diana' exhibit, as it's just as much about other royals (From George VI to Catherine Middleton) as it is about Diana herself. It was so much more than I expected!ALLOW ENOUGH TIME - 2-3 HOURSMy only regret is that going with a group, we only had an hour-and-a-half to see the exhibit and I could have done with about double that. I felt very rushed, so allow a good 2-3 hours just for the exhibit and then more to see the Queen Mary.WHAT YOU'LL SEEThere are a lot of historical plaques to read, lots of Royal memorabilia, everything from family photos, Christmas cards that the Queen sent out, Fergies 'back-up' wedding dress, original newspaper stories, auctioned dresses of Diana, photos with U.S. presidents, original letters and cards sent by various royals, several outfits of Kate Middleton's, including her blue 'engagement' dress, video footage, plates, dolls, paintings by Charles, Diana's hair appointment schedule, royal dinner menus, funeral programs, wedding invitations, jewelry, tiaras, recordings of Diana's voice...and so much more!SADLY, NO PHOTOGRAPHY OR SOUVENIR PROGRAM BOOKThe only downside is that you're not allowed to take photos and there isn't a program available for purchase. The gift shop is OK, but offers mostly non-specific royal items like 'Keep Calm and Carry On' tea-towels, china tea-cups, Union Jack pillows and a few Diana things like T-shirts, note-cards and posters.IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE ROYALS...GO!!!I am a British expat residing in Southern California and was a huge Diana fan when I was younger, collecting books and magazines about her and her fashion. I'm now just as interested in Kate Middleton. In general I love anything to do with British Royaty, so I loved this exhibit. If you're not that into the royals, you might find it so-so, but it's still a very precious and unique collection.",Don'tWaitForRetirement
50,Impressive,"Great tour on a boat that had many uses and rivaled Titanic in its size. The ghost tour is supposed to be fabulous, but I have not taken it yet. Not inexpensive, but there is a lot to see and feel.",Artsy12
30,"Grand, but frustrating","The Queen Mary is the last survivor of the Golden Age of travel. Though even in her heyday her interior design was considered a bit dowdy, she was the most beloved and successful liner ever built. Trying to tour this gem is a trying experience.The problem is that the Queen Mary tries to be two very different things - a posh hotel that gives its guests privacy and comfort, and a tourist attraction that draws as many paying customers as possible. The day tourist must take one of several themed tours, all rather pricy, some just plain silly, (The Ghost Tour), and no one of which gives you a full tour of all the grand spaces you would want to see. There is a less expensive self guided tour, but this really doesn't show you anything you couldn't see just wandering about on your own. We finally did get to see the Grand Salon and First Class Dining Room just by opening some doors.Several years ago - in fact, shortly after the Queen Mary opened to the public - I had the pleasure of spending several hours wandering this great ship completely undisturbed. I would swear I was the only person aboard. I was everywhere, even in the projection booth, silver vault, and first class pool. I realize those days are long gone and that the Queen Mary must make money by attracting as many visitors as possible, but I don't think they have quite found the right formula yet.",DOD56
40,"Fun day, not cheap- use AAA discount if you have it!","I had been wanting to see the Princess Diana exhibit for a long time. We finally went. It started with a pleasant surprise. The exhibit is not only Princess Diana's gowns but also many different correspondences beginning with the Queen Mother. There was quite a bit on the Queen, her husband and then ended with Prince William and Kate. Since it wasn't just Diana's gowns, my husband enjoyed the exhibit as well.We then had drinks in the bar area which gives you a nice view of Long Beach Harbor. We then continued on with the self guided tour of the ship. This was fun. If you think about what it might have been like so many years ago to travel across the ocean on this huge vessel.We also went to the Russian Submarine which sits right next to the Queen Mary. Very interesting and we were glad we did this.The biggest disappointment of the entire day is that parking is $15.00 for the day. Tickets were not cheap either, but if you have AAA it gives you a nice discount. We had a beautiful day, and were glad we went.",debtaylor
50,She is really a grand old lady,"I love to stroll aboard th QM. There is so much history connected with this ship. The ship is a beautiful work of art. Again close to all fun thinks a a free shuttle from downtown,aqarium,and Shore line village.",J E
30,dont know what to think,i have never been on a liner before and wanted to see what its likeupon entering the ship there are loads of flies!!!not much to see apart from historydecks are nice to relax in the sundont knwo what to think,babyangel2007
50,1 night on the QM,"We had room M-034, which had 2 double beds, tv,shower, and crab tree&evelyn soaps; very nice.Bed was very comfortable, room was clean and had 2 port holes we could peek out of for a view of long beach.Internet is NOT free- only downfall.Customer service was TOP NOTCH! Checking in and checking out, valet- all very nice.We have a 9 yr old with Aspergers and he has always loved ships; and knows allot about their history, hence why we chose to spend 1 night on our vacation here. The check in girl gave him extra room key cards, which all have various pics of the QM and a ""passport"".I wasn't sure what to expect but the ship itself is very impressive, its fun to walk around and there are free self guided tours and paid tours offering various aspects of the ship.One thing to be warned is walls are PAPER THIN. I could hear my neighbors and I am sure they were almost wispering. and above us was a party and they may as well have been dancing on our bed.NO SOUND BUFFERING.With that being said, they offer free earplugs and there is a warning somewhere (which I missed), apprently letting people know this.Given that it is an old ship, it is what it its. We were so tired after coming off a 4 day disney trip, we slept pretty good despite the noise.I enjoyed the restaurant on the promonade deck, my 2 young boys and I had the buffet and it was good. Nothing amazing, but good.Service and nostalgia make this a fantastic and fun experience.Oh- and beware- all the gift shops on the boat are independant & not part of the QM Hotel, so watch prices etc....when shopping.",wendy s
30,Great potential - poor delivery,"I'm an old machinery tragic, so I was looking forward to looking over this old ship. I'm also an engineer, so I like to see things in an ordered way. We went on the self guided tour. What a fiasco.Firstly, you get your ticket at separate building, then go up the 4th floor, then get directed down to Z deck to get your headset. The guided tour must have been designed by someone who is challenged in system design. You are directed to all parts of the ship, and nothing flows. There are no signs, doors are locked, or don't exist. A sample 1st class room appears where it shouldn't. A cut-a-way of the Titanic appears near the engine room. What was it doing there??Having said all that, there are some very interesting parts of the ship - shame the tour is so poorly put together.Had lunch at the Promenade restaurant. Nothing too flash there. Good view, ordinary food.One thing I never understood - what is the association between Long Island and the Queen Mary? And whats the story with the Russian sub? It seems a little out of place.",Grahame_B255060
40,Nostalgic,"We stayed for one night on the Queen Mary as we were attending a family lunch on board. The QM is a truly impressive ship which brings stories from the past alive and is magnificent for its authenticity. The only slight disappointment for us were the catering/ restaurant options - the Promenade cafe was uninspiring and airless and the coffee bar looked as if it was temporary. The Chowder bar service was slow. The rooms however were wonderful , with many original features but also some added modern extras like TV. We chose a deluxe twin room which has windows but we were looking at the dock so asking for a view of Long Beach would be my recommendation. The only problem with the rooms was the very thin wall of the connecting door which meant that you could hear every word from the next room- earplugs required! As a guest you are able to wonder around most of the ship which is highly recommended so allow time to walk at leisure.",DK63
30,Iconic,My suggestion would be to visit for Sunday Brunch! You can't beat the selection and varity of foods and then afterwards take a nice stroll on the deck for the amazing views,travelshooter71
50,unbelievable and amazing hotel rich with history and beauty,"Wow! Beautiful wood carvings and ""pictures"" in paneling throughout ship, walk through museum on board that shows history of ship from being built to transport of WW11 soldiers to becoming a hotel in the gorgeous city of long beach, Can. Our room was exquisite comprised of 3 rooms with views or the ocean bay area out our portholes. The bed was very comfortable and its amazing the storage space inside the panels of the rooms! There were shelfs everywhere and a beautiful vanity and entrance way to our room. We lounged on deck and enjoyed the sunshine and meandered through the shops and enjoyed the delicious restaurants. Would definitely recommend if in the area!",tanyasm
20,"Interesting, but pricey","We live in Southern California and had not been to Queen Mary for many years. It started out very poorly. The price for the package we choose was a very steep $44.95 per. (We did receive $5 ea off with auto club, which they stated was more than senior discount.) They also posted a sign that stated the combo package for Queen Mary/Aquarium was sold out. We found this very difficult to believe that on a cool, Thursday in February, they were sold out. At no time were there many cars in the lot nor many people touring. (We drove by the Aquarium afterward, and it was not crowded either.) It is by far the best deal and I truly believe that they did not want to honor. Upon entering, we were told to go to 4th floor to obtain headsets for self-guided audio tour. Then we were told to go down 2 floors to the engine room (where tour begins) to receive sets. We ran into others who were also roaming around helplessly as there was no one to help. We went back up again and demanded to be escorted to the location, where lo and behold, we were given at that location after all. They offered NO apology, just an excuse that someone had been called away. The self-guided tour was OK. We also went on the ""Golden Years"" tour (with only 3 others). It was led by an excellent, knowledgeable gentleman. Was suppose to last an hour, but was close to 1 1/2 hours. After that, we had a delicious lunch at the Promenade Cafe. (only restaurant open for lunch.) Husband and a wonderful chicken pot pie. Parking was a ridiculous $15. (It is only $5 if validated at restaurant and stay is less than 3 hours.) Summary $105 for two, excluding lunch, is a bit much. Summary - could not recommend at these prices.",Sharon W
50,Classic piece of maritime history,"I first fell in love with the Queen Mary when I visited it as a 9y/o kid back in 1984, and after all these years, the grand ol' boart has not lost its luster for me. As a maritime history buff and military history afficicionado, the ship never ceases to fascinate me no matter how many times I go back. I especially love posing for pics on the Bofors 40mm antiaircraft gun! The restaurants are a classy and relaxing place to bring a date, and the entire atmosphere is a nostalgic throwback to a bygone era that makes you wish that the Queen was still cruising.",TrojanSkyCop1
40,A great way to spent a day,"We purchased the Grand Voyage Tour, which consists of several tours and passes. We started with a guided tour of the public areas. The tour was excellent. Next we did the Ghosts & Legends Tour which took us into the dark boiler rooms. We used the on-board restaurant for a light lunch and were not disappointed. Food and service were good. Afterwards we visited the Diana: Legacy of a Princess a Royal Exhibition which my wife enjoyed very much. I got even with her when we visited the Russian Scorpion Foxtrot Submarine, which is right next to the Queen Mary and was included in the tour package. All in all, it took six hours to see and enjoy everything.",wguhl
20,"Huge potential, but alas, not really worth it.","What could have been a fascinating and fun tour experiencing the grandeur of ocean travel decades ago is ruined by decades of mismanagement and underfunding.As others have mentioned the price is high, especially for what you get. $15 parking plus about $65 for our family with a AAA discount.We arrived in time for the Ghost and Legends tour. It seemed weak and it was scary for our young children (8 and 5), so we left early and took the self guided audio tour.The audio tour is badly out of date (some numbered attractions are no longer accessible) and doors were locked. Apparently it has not been updated in years. Signs are missing, making it somewhat confusing, and directions are convoluted, taking you unnecessarily back and forth through the length of the the enormous liner.I imagine it costs a huge amount of money maintaining and renovating such a hulk of a ship. From what I read, management of the QM has changed hands several times over the years. However, it seems like the current company could do far better, starting with a few low-cost improvements like posting a few direction signs, unlocking doors that are supposed to be unlocked for the tour, and updating the audio on the tour.Overall, it is troubling that the old liner is looking so tatty. There is such potential for an absolutely fabulous and fun adventure touring this ship...but quite simply it is not worth it.Before we visited, we were considering staying for a night on the ship...in hindsight we made the right decision by opting not to.",martygSeattle_WA
30,Not so great for events,"I am a resident of Long Beach and have been to countless events on the Queen Mary. Sadly, the venue never improves. We recently attended Scotsfest and right off the bat the frustration began. Firstly, $15 event parking. And you have to walk quite a distance to get in. Secondly, and most frustrating, their signage sucks. It was absolutely unclear where to buy tickets. Unclear where to enter the event. And it goes on, and on and on.Not to mention, the outside of the boat and the Russian sub are in such need of paint jobs that they look shabby.",Jennifer J
50,Queen Mary - Classic !,"We were able to tour the Queen Mary as an added plus for attending the Scotsfest that was held on the grounds. We were amazed by the sheer size. The views of the surrounding harbor are amazing. The staff was pleasant .We did not get to do the audio tours or special presentations that come with the higher price tickets but it was fun exploring the ship on our own. We were amazed by the sheer sizePlease do remember - this is a luxury liner from 1930 so don't expect it to be up to modern day luxury standards. Appreciate it for what it is - a floating museum of times gone by. There are exhibits of the living quarters and you can see the control rooms etc.All in all - a fun day! Next time, we'll pay to do the audio tour and see some of the other presentations available for the extra feesThere are lots of shops for souvenirs...high priced which is typical of Southern California tourist attractions but where else can you buy a Queen Mary t-shirt and say you got it from the Queen Mary?The food is expensive. Eat before you go.",Off2SeeItAll
20,"Nostalgia wears off quickly, but the propeller was really interesting","This ship was kind of sad. Like watching such an old star go dim. For such a big ship, there's not that much to see. I'm not even sure it would be worth staying in one of the state rooms as a hotel. The only interesting thing was the propeller just outside the engine room. They have an extension where you can walk just outside the ship, and look down into the water at the giant propeller. With the lighting, it's really eerie.We bought our tickets as a combo with the Aquarium of the Pacific. But it was still overpriced. Also, there's lots of gnats flying around all over.The restaurant just next to the cafe was good, but expensive, not surprisingly.",redningja
40,"""Chill"" was the best part!","The Christmas ice-carving exhibit ""Chill"" was the best part of the Queen Mary experience. That the artists could carve such wonderful shapes in such numbers was amazing. The colors were bright and the figures exact. [[Be aware, it is below zero degrees to preserve all the sculptures, and while they make available extra clothing, my being allergic meant I had to just use my own, and it was COLD.]]The Queen Mary itself was a luxurious experience. We had their famous clam chowder in the Chelsea Chowder House. Well worth the pause in our rush to see everything we needed to be quick to view.We took the backsights tour, led by a former captain, and he was very knowledgeable. It was neat to see rooms we would not otherwise have gotten to see, unless we stayed at the hotel there.",orcasgal
30,Don't expect too much.,"The main thing to remember about this hotel is that it basically a museum. No pool, no spa and no gym. So if that’s what you want, don’t stay here.It’s a great place if you want the authentic old time cruise experience.The food from room service is terrible and over priced! Don’t to do it. Breakfast especially is bad & expensive. There’s a coffee stand with bagels, etc or use the restaurant.The rooms are great. The restaurants are great. Nice romantic trip.The daytime staff was great and professional, but the night staff is very disappointing. We changed rooms due to the noise from construction and were assured that our new room would be ready when we returned from shopping. The woman working at night was VERY rude, couldn’t handle the simplest task and basically should not even be working at MacDonald’s in customer service.",Sandee K
10,Queen Mary is not worth the time,Used the Long Beach free local bus/shuttle to ride from the Long Beach beachfront area to the Queen Mary. We paid for our admission at the front kiosk and were given instructions from the kiosk as to what to do and where to go. This seemed like poor logistics as others waited to pay while we were getting instructions and asking questions. The tour route seemed poorly laid out - to go see the engine room one had to go the length of the ship from outside and then down some stairs. The headsets only stated what was on the written signs which seems to be chincy. We tooked a guided tour which was basically a trumped up ghosts of the St Mary exhibition. It did show some more of the ship but one was in the dark too much.All in all this Ship tour can not hold a candle to the Midway in San Diego.,klaggs
50,What a marvelous ship reminds me a lot of the Titannic,"This ship is huge, not as large as modern day ocean liners, but still a magnificent site. If you love ships, then you will enjoy touring this ship. My tour was quick (although it was my second time here), I was in the middle of a business trip, so I did a quick detour to the Queen Mary. I didn't take the Ghost tour, so I cannot comment on it, although to be honest, the first time I toured the Queen Mary, I didn't see any ghosts.This is an expensive tour these days, but, again, if you love old ships, then this is for you and worth the price. You get to tour most areas of the ship and can imagine what it was like to travel back in the days when steamers still ruled the waves.For a family, unless your young ones are interested in big ships, this might not be the place for you, as there is limited things for kids to see and do.",Darren_in_BC
50,I freaking loved it!,"This is a delayed review. I visited the Queen Mary on October 17, 2012. I freaking loved it! I went because it was my traveling companion's lifelong dream (literally) to see the Queen Mary. I think I liked better than he did. It is a bit pricey, and I didn't appreciate the fact that the ticket seller wasn't upfront about the times of the tours and the exhibits. The Russian sub was closed for renovations, but I wasn't that upset about it since I am claustrophobic.Many people here have been critical about the Ghosts and Legends Tour. If you are expecting to see real ghosts, stay in the hotel and wander the ship at night. If you are touring in the day and want to have a fun and entertaining experience, DO the Ghosts and Legends tour. We thought it was full of fun, and our tour guide, Dustin, was totally creepy. He really got into the part and made it suspenseful. A kid on our tour was so scared after Dustin's introduction that his family had to leave the tour. The special effects were very well done. I don't know why anyone wouldn't love it. I thought it was comparable to a top notch haunted house and the tour allowed us to go into the underbelly of the ship.After that tour we wandered the ship. I really enjoyed that we could roam around so freely, although I would have liked to spend more time in some of the ghosts & legends tour rooms. The control/boiler rooms of the ship are a steampunk's dream. So dark and dank and full of pipes and gauges and cool. I found myself wandering alone down there in the mass of steel and iron. It was kinda freaky, in a good way. The top decks were a little ragged, but way cool. I think they are trying to preserve as much of the original ship as possible. It seems like some reviewers don't want anything to be old. Well, the Queen Mary is old. That's a big part of why it's so neat.The art deco style of the lobbies and common areas is magnificent. The observation bar is legendary and it lives up to it's art deco style. We had a couple of drinks there. We sat in the lobby for along time, just soaking up the atmosphere.We ate dinner at Sir Winston's. We never saw the room with the awesome view that they advertise on the website. We had a nice view out the side of the ship in a small room. The service was excellent. The food was good, but probably not worth the price. I had beef wellington, he had the roasted chicken.If you like art deco, steam punk, ghosts, haunted houses, history, ships, old world glamour, complicated fire maps, elegant lobbies, shops and/or staircases, visit the Queen Mary.Even if you don't think you like any of those things, the Queen Mary might surprise you. It surprised me.I can't express how much I loved my time on the Queen Mary. Next trip I will definitely stay on board. I found the ship surreal and I could really feel the history. They have 20's music playing faintly in many areas around the ship which was a little creepy and a lot of awesome. The propeller box is so massively huge that picture doesn't do it justice. There are so many little things. Perhaps you have to be into the spirit of the history to truly appreciate it. Me? I can't wait to go back.",Shellyfish5
50,Incredible history,"Queen Mary is an incredible piece of history. It is difficult to believe that it went through WWII. Now it is a hotel and a museum with many shops, restaurants and bars. My favorite restaurant is Sir Winston's restaurant. The view is magnificent, especially at night. It is very romantic and elegant. The menu is impressive, and the service was impeccable. Beef Wellington was delicious. It is a great place for a romance. They have great selection of champagne. Cheers!",Mila K

20,a waste of time.,"Overpriced at $25 a person. One basically just wandered around aimlessly on the ship until one got tired of wandering.

20,It's past it's time,"For the price, it just wasn't worth the effort. The location is okay and not bad if you are leaving or coming back from a cruise. For a ""one time shot"" it is probably worth it, but if you are a repeat visitor like I was then it's just not worth the second trip",Robert B
20,Such a shame,We traveled down to Long Beach to see the Queen Mary hoping to see some of that wonderful tradition of the golden age of travel. What a shame to find that this grand old lady of the oceans seems to be being neglected and slowly deteriorating to a point where i believe soon it will not be retrievable.I found it shocking to see that shops selling tacky ornaments and generally rubbish items that I think everyone could live without had been allowed into the grand lobby.The cafe's seemed unwholesome and the swarms of flies all over the boat is deeply concerning as to its cleanlinessWe had hoped that we could have experienced seeing in some of the grand rooms but on the whole none of these were open for public view. Not even a glimpse in any cabins only some mock ups of cabins at the back of the boat.I am afraid that the City of Long Beach is doing this attraction no favours at all.I only hope that they can recover this wonderful piece of maritime history before it is too late.To add insult to this then paying $15 to park the car for less than 3 hours did not help.Generally felt ripped off and feel that the amount of money to visit this attraction is not being used to maintain the boat.,Planewreck
50,Princess Diana Exhibit,"I absolutely loved this exhibit on the Queen Mary! I have slept on and toured the ship twice, but went again for this very special exhibit. It's so much more than just the Princess Diana Exhibit since they have handwritten letters by Queen Mary, the Queen Mum, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, and Charles, George VI (King's Speech), Philip. To list a few of the things on display, there are: many newspapers with stories beginning with Queen Mary and King George V, through Queen Elizabeth's parents, the bombing of Buckingham Palace, Elizabeth's reign, wedding of Diana and Chas, birth of the princes, their split, Wm and Kate's wedding. There are dishes from the Royal Yacht, a rare letter by Princess Margaret, many beautiful Royal Worchester porcelain figurines of the royal women (from Queen Victoria to the present), wedding and dinner invitations, a birthday party invitation in Diana's hand, Christmas cards signed by the royals, dolls and mannequins with copies of the royal dresses, and the backup wedding dress for the Duchess of York (Fergie), which I thoroughly enjoyed seeing. Also dress sketches, a copy of the spectacular black gown Diana wore and caused a stir. There's a garden bench from Highgrove, copies of Diana's diamond tiaras, lots of royal souvenirs from weddings, coronations, the palaces, etc. Three of Charles' watercolors are on display, also dinner menus, the shoes Helena wore in the King's Speech, the Queen Mum's handbag and beautiful letter opener with many photos of her from 1900-2002. A large doll is dressed in an exact replica of Diana's wedding dress and there's a full-size replica of her bridal bouquet. There are many more things to see, plus the beautiful dresses that Diana wore in a separate room, and a room with Kate's clothes, etc. I was really impressed with all of it and think most followers of the royals will enjoy it. I heard a group talking about the cost of the ticket ($35) and all of them were agreeing it was worth it. I only paid $25 through Goldstar and my ticket was for all day 10-6. One can tour the rest of the ship on the same day. Parking is a bit steep - $15. We went on a weekday at 10 a.m. and there were no crowds.",Linda C
30,Dark Harbor,"Visit date: October 2011Downed a couple of good drinks at Sir Winston's on the ship prior. Go to the Hotel entrance and take the elevator to the fourth floor.Around 7pm we shot through the fastpass line - actually there was no line. The general admission line was already fairly long, but it seemed to move well. I would suggest fastpass if you are planning on attending any time after 8pm. This year they sold tickets for $20 if you arrived within the first hour, a pretty good deal, and FP for only $20 more per ticket.The mazes offered some nice twists and turns as well as several good and unexpected scares. The Cage maze included some really loud music which was unbearable, and I got lost a couple of times. At one part I could not see at all and started pushing a mirror open and realized we were accidentally leaving the maze through a side wall. I turned around and everybody else was following me, too. There was a lot of smoke, so expect plenty of disorientation. Set designs were cool, although some areas in a couple of mazes smelled awkwardly wrong.Grab a couple of welcoming stiff drinks at the Devil's bar, about $9/ea. The gentleman was not stingy in his pouring. Kettle Corn also available as well as other snacks (tacos I believe?) The band was good and I was impressed by the sound quality coming from the speakers. There is a fun little green screen photography souvenir booth, too. It looked cool, but I passed it without even inquiring about the price. They had one fellow standing in the walking area trying to convince everybody to try it out, over and over again - a little annoying because it is located within the main thoroughfare.There are 5 mazes in all, and they aren't too short either, which gives it good value, in my opinion. Parking will most likely be $15-$20 (sorry folks!) But if you live in the downtown Long Beach area, take the red Passport bus for free!",Pilotchip
20,"Can't board the ship anymore, even to shop or dine","One used to be able to board the ship and visit a limited area in order to visit the gift shops or dine in one of the restaurants. Now that is no longer possible...one must buy a ticket to enter the ship at all. I understand that there is some sort of credit given in the dining rooms for having purchased a ticket. Still, it seems a shame and a bad way to do business. A friend of hours was instrumental in bringing the ship to Long Beach back in the 1960's; things seem to have gone downhill from there,",azzure
50,Excellent nostalgic attraction,We spent half a day exploring the ship on a self guided engine room tour and then on an escorted tour deeper into the ship. Had cocktails on the observation bar and a fabulous dinner at Sir Winstons. Felt like we were back in time in our hotel room with a wonderful ocean and skyline view. For a special occasion and something different I would definitely recommend!,jeff M
50,A Royal Blast from the Past,"I have long wanted to tour the Queen Mary and the special Diana Exhibition made it seem the perfect time to do it. We met friends there and enjoyed a long afternoon together. We viewed the Diana Exhibit first which is very well done, beautiful to look at and educational. There were interesting newspapers, letters, photographs and, of course, the dresses to view. We enjoyed our afternoon tea in the Tea Room. Expensive but tasty and fitting for the day's activities. We later toured the ship itself. I was told the headset audio tour is outdated, so we just used the provided map, walked around and read the displays which seemed fine. It looks like people care about the ship and work to present it in a positive light to the public, showcasing a nostalgic way of life to a modern audience.",RetroFan
40,This could have been a 5 if they had ship board activities,"We stayed in the hotel overnight in a suite. Wow, did they ever know how to live back then. It had about 5 rooms!So what do they need to do to get to a 5 star - they need the shipboard activities you expect on a cruise. How about nightly entertainment in one of the theatres and how about a buffet breakfast at least?",Ronald K
40,Why Discourage People By Limiting their Time on the Ship?,"My girlfriends and I had a great day visiting the Queen Mary and having lunch in the Tea Room. The Diana Exhibit was worth the $32.00 per person it cost us to get in, especially, since a portion of the funds go to support breast cancer research.In another review, I report on the delightful lunch experience we had in the Tea Room. Overall, I think our day at the Queen Mary was something we would like to experience again.But, we will think twice when we think about how the parking scenario works. You should be forewarned. If you go to an exhibit and have a leisurely lunch, the restaurant will stamp your ticket to pay for three hours at the ship. If, however, you stay more than three hours, you will pay the daily charge of $15 (not so bad as attractions go). It was completely confusing for us, as we thought our validation for lunch would cover us as we completed our trip through the exhibit. It doesn't.So, if you go to the Queen Mary and you want to take the time to see the exhibits and have lunch, be prepared to pay the whole parking fee. Don't bother with getting your parking validated.",Mary B
50,CLYDE BUILT.,"I must confess to a conflict of interest. The RMS Qheen Mary was built in my home town, Clydebank, and she is exactly the same age as I am. In fact my late Father-in-law built her. He was one of the men who shaped her plates. He used to say that he did the difficult bits.",Bob S
40,what a combo ! Queen Mary and Princess Diana,"We were not aware when our group bought the Queen Mary tickets, that the ship also offered the Princess Diana exhibition. What a treat! We started onboard with a breakfast in the elegant dining room, then did a self guided tour of the Queen Mary. Headsets with info are an additional cost, but worth it. Then we walked thru the rooms holding the Princess Diana collection which had so much to see! (seperate entrance fee) Because we were in a group, we had a designated departure time so we were a little rushed. Our 16 yr old grand daughter was with us and this was one of her favorite excursions.",Sandy D
40,A piece of history with good places to eat,"This historic ship anchored in Long Beach is a piece of history. It is very interesting to take a self-tour to see the engine room, radio room, etc. There are also three restaurants on the ship. We ate lunch at the tea room which has a great view looking out over Long Beach and good good. Winston's, the upscale restaurant, unfortunately only opens after 5, but the menu looks impressive.",jjc34
30,An Art Deco Surprise,"We enjoyed our visit to the Queen Mary very much and would love to go back to spend the night in a state room. Reviewers' comments about some dinginess are true, but we didn't find that to detract from the impressive historical authenticity of the ship. We started with lunch in the Promenade Cafe and then spent several hours walking the decks under the guidance of the self-guided audio tour. I used my own earphones with the digital recorder and found the narration to be interesting even if a bit cheesy. We got a bit lost a few times, but nothing that a quick look at the map couldn't fix. The tickets are expensive, but we saved $5 on each with a AAA discount. Worth a visit!",ArlingtonTravels
50,"History and fun, wrapped up in one place","Every time I visit the Queen Mary I find something new. I live local to the area and still find I'm visiting her 4 to 5 times a year. Every time there is something new, something interesting and always educational. When I leave I promise to get back soon and somehow never quite make it as often as I would like. I vow to be better in 2013!",ChipMichael
40,Queen Mary Tour,"If you do not have the time to spend the night on board, just take a tour and enjoy the history of the ship. They offer several types of tours, including a self-guided one. The Ghost Tours are meant to add some mystery to your visit. Our tour guide said that the day before someone who had been on her tour days earlier showed her a photo he took that caught an image of a face in the photo. We did not see anything but who knows. There is so much history to learn and enjoy on board.",LovingRetirement67
20,Old and Needs a Facelift,"Really, don't bother with the Queen Mary unless you've never been on a big ship and want to see what it's like--and can at least imagine what one might have been like in its heyday. The ship shows its age and wear. It doesn't seem cared for and needs attention (paint, varnish, carpets cleaned).The self-guided tour wasn't bad, but it's easy to get lost and turned around. The narrative seemed to focus on the ship's mechanics which are of minimal interest to the average tourist, I'd think. Be prepared to walk a lot, especially up and down stairs. I'm a historian, so I found the historic exhibit and story of the Queen Mary interesting.Because much of the ship is used as a hotel, we were unable to see staterooms, but the guided walking tour does allow visitors to peer into the captain's quarters and those of some of the crew. It would have been nice to see a stateroom. Because the ballrooms and lounges are used for events, whey weren't set up to demonstrate what the elegance of the bygone era was like. That was also disappointing.The general admission ticket included the Ghosts and Legends tour, a corny attempt to tell somewhat interesting stories about the ship and its guests. The tour guides knew it was corny and laughed along with us. I appreciated the fact that they didn't take themselves too seriously. My 10-year-old son got scared and had to leave the tour. The guides had warned us in advance that this might be the case and we appreciated that. On the whole, though, we found the employees half-hearted. Better training in customer service would be beneficial.The cost is about what you'd expect: $24.95 for adults and $14.95 for kids. Parking is extra, but you can take a shuttle to the Aquarium of the Pacific and leave your car parked in the Queen Mary lot. This helps avoid extra driving.",jsctraveler
20,Disappointed!,Thetour packages or options are overpriced for what you get to see. There is not enough of the sip open for you to see. We could not see any staterooms because they use part of the ship as a hotel. We also were blocked from seeing the large dining and ballrooms.mmThe price of our tour was $35 which included the Princess Di exhibit. We got a $5 discount with a AAA card. The onlt plus was that we got to eat lunch in the Tea Room and the meal price was reasonable.,beachlover48
20,The Prostitution of Our Queen,"As a native of Long Beach, I have to say that I am less than thrilled at the ""selling out"" of our beautiful Queen Mary for a buck these days. The ship itself is a gorgeous and majestic as ever, but it's the way the current owners are cheapening her and the experience of her history for visitors in the name of a quick buck that is worrisome.I hadn't seen the QM in several years, having moved out to AZ. I decided to bring my boyfriend with me this trip, visiting relatives and introducing Long Beach to him for the first time. The Aquarium was impressive (as always), the beach cities were stunning (as always), and the LBC was lovely, of course. But the QM was sad.First, we were hit up for $20 bucks cash upfront for parking (Saturday). WOW. Robbery. This is their regular weekend rate.We had purchased our Aquarium passport together with the basic QM ticket. This included the Ghost tour, and a self-guided tour, but not parking. We just shrugged this off. What could we do but pay it? That's what they figure everyone will do, of course.We got to the ticket booth and the woman was abrupt and kind of rude when we asked simple questions about where the self-guided tour was. Whatever. We were determined to have a good time anyway!We stopped at the Chelsey Chowder place first....yikes, what an unprofessional hostess! She was downright rude to everyone there, complaining loudly that ""this isn't my normal restaurant. I'm not even supposed to be here."" Wow. Sloppy dresser, too, for such a lovely ship. So, the owners don't care much about decorum, apparently. Oh, well. When we finally got seated, the food was good and the nice waitress made up for it.Then, we went on the Ghost tour....LOUD is all I remember. It was very cool to get to go down to the boiler room, but they've made it into what many on our tour called ""cheesy and annoying."" Lots of special effects. The water pouring through the walls was good, but the cheesy jokes and the hideous volume of it all left many of us kind of deaf. So much for the Ghost tour...On to the self-guided tour. Well, by the time we found anyone who knew where we could get a head set (we went back and forth the length of the ship twice on bad info), we were told by the woman there that ""well, you might as well not listen to the audio because it doesn't give you any background info at all. It just tells you where you are, which you can see for yourself."" Swell. It was just as well, though, because the headsets were filthy, having been worn on the ears of the general public over and over. Yuck.So, we decided to just roam around on our own, which was much more fun than what we really paid for....hmmm.All in all, the ship herself is as stunning as ever...it's the ownership that is sadly lacking in quality, professionalism, and respect for the great QM. She has been sold out at a great cost to any visitor.Hopefully, new owners are on the horizon...?",Jaybird61
20,Not worth the money,Found this to be very over-rated. The ship has been turned into a hotel and they have tried to do a hotel and attraction without success. Signage was poor and audio tour we were warned was not updated and could be very confusing. Paid $35 to tour ship without audio tour and had poor or non-existent directions. Many areas were turned into stores and had no idea what these areas used to be. Princess Diana exhibit was very good but had nothing to do with the Queen Mary. I went hoping to see the Queen Mary and felt they did a poor job trying to make the ship a hotel and tourist attraction.,Debbie H
40,Got what I wanted,"While I didn't have any first hand sightings of ghosts it was fun to explore the ship on my own with my girlfriend and take in our own adventure. We had planned to do the ""Chill"" winter thing they had going but we decided we were there for the ship so we payed 10 dollars for the little tour which was fun because it took us into the pool area and rooms that would normally be locked.The room itself wasn't too bad, obviously the walls and such are dated but the bed, tv, and clock had all been nice and fairly new. Disappointedly it had no fridgarator in the room so we chilled our alcohol on a bucket of ice. The shower was a little odd and slopped to the middle so my feet would slide together.We ate dinner on the ship at its cheaper restaurant which was romantic and fairly affordable and very good.Over all you don't go to the queen Mary for just a hotel you go there to stay on a price of history. If you just want a room for the night I suggest going to a normal hotel where your room will be bigger and have more modern amenities if you want a special kind of place then I suggest the queen Mary",Aneddieray
40,"If you are interested in ships, you will enjoy","If you are interested in touring a famous ship, then you will enjoy this. My husband is very interested in this sort of thing and so our family of five (kids ages 8-15) went last week when we were visiting the area. It is educational for the kids - everyone got something out of it. It was a beautiful day to wander around the ship at our own pace and get a sense of what it was like to travel on the Queen Mary, who traveled on it and why. There is a lot of history here. Based on other reviews, I'm not sure what people are expecting. It's a docked ship. If that sounds boring to you, don't go. I wouldn't have gone if not for my husband, but I found it worthwhile. We ate lunch at the restaurant, with windows overlooking the water. The food was good and the prices were reasonable.",Ellen2006
30,Not Too Impressed,"We decided to take a tour of the ship because we enjoy history. It was a self-guided tour - whatever that means!! Supposedly, there were headsets to guide you around the ship, pointing out things, but we were told by someone working on the ship that the headsets were not good and we would be better off just wandering around on our own. IT WAS A JOKE. Other than seeing some old wood work and the basic lay out of the ship, we were very disappointed. The ship caters to those staying in the ""hotel"" and NOT to the general public wanting to experience the grandeur of the ship itself. Did I mention IT WAS A JOKE.We also bought tickets for the Diana exhibit. It was interesting. Had several of her dresses and lots of memorabilia about the Royal Family. Should have spent more time in that exhibit and less time wandering around the ship!!!",Daisies33
20,Princess Diana exhibition,first of all $20 to park and on muddy grass no I'm not even in the expo and I'm feeling ripped off. Next $35 to see basically a Barbie doll collection of Diana dresses and some old newspapers. Can't recommend this at all.,Mona P
40,Sunday Brunch,"We ate here on 12/23/12. The dining room is quite lovely. Our reservation was for 1pm, we arrived a little early but were seated right away. Almost immediately our waiter appeared with juice and champange and asked if there was any other beverage anyone wanted. They weren't as busy as they have been on our previous visits (probably because of the continued increase in cost for the brunch). However the food was excellent and there were large amounts of it (fresh looking and replaced frequently).... salad bar with fruit and selection of cheese's (brie, cheddar, gouda and swiss), large amounts of fresh seafood, mexican station (chef prepared specialities), carving station (turkey and prime rib), 2 kinds of soup and pasta, breakfast selections as well as an omelet station and of course a dessert table.... choc fountain and chef made crepes. I'm sure I forgot something....oh and there is a harpist that preforms during the brunch as well. Our drinks were refilled practically before we put them down and coffe was hot and fresh.I would definitely return for brunch again.... parking is reduced when you go to brunch...plus you can look around the ship for 'free' after you eat.",Elphie1162
10,typical,really didn't care for it. i guess it's okay if you are into that kind of stuff we really only went because we had a combination ticket to the ice sculpture,TREK39
40,A Fun and Interesting Place if You Like History,"We spent 3 nights on the Queen Mary over Christmas break. There were pros and cons to the ship, but overall we had a good experience.The pros ~ an upclose look at a bygone era, an unending adventure if you like exploring on your own, a new and different experience!The cons ~ poor and confusing communication whether it be in person or through signage. We had several instances of different answers depending on who we talked with. An overall lack of attention to customer service seemed to be the norm whether it was talking with the front desk, the person selling tickets,a couple of shop keepers we encountered or the Promenade restuarant staff. In fact, this became the running joke our first 24 hours onboard. That said, we are pretty low key/flexible travelers and once we lowered our expectations we were good (sad to say, but true).Staying onboard the Queen Mary is not for those who are used to staying in nice hotels, you will be disappointed. It's old, it's not all been refurbished (you'll see this when you start exploring and stumble across roomsand areas that need updating), the walls are thin and the furnishings old. Again, part of the charm for us was the originality. We stayed in a family suite and were very happy with our rooms. The beds were very comfortable.Overall we enjoyed our stay and are glad we did it. That said, I'm not so sure I would feel the need to stay on her again.The Princess Diana exhibit was great, plan on a couple of hours. The Russian sub was closed due to a leak. The ""Chill"" exhibit was fun and all of the employees we encountered at Chill were exceptional. Even our son commented that the people working at the Chill exhibit should be working on the ship. They were just happy, upbeat and seemed happy to see people and give directions.I would recommend this experience to family and friends, but would caution them to realize that it's not going to be equivilant to The Hampton Inn. If that's what you're looking for then you're better off skipping an overnight stay and just go onboard to walk around.",Ttoopel
30,"Pleasant stay, but wouldn't want to return","I came here on a business trip. I wasn't sure what to expect, staying on a ship and all, but it was ok.I like the idea of the hotel, a rustic ship you can stay on while in the Long Beach area.The furnishings are old, but not at all broken. The service was good. I was upgraded from a King bedroom to a ocean view with a queen bed.Pros:The viewThe serviceCons:The thermostat was brokenWalls are so thin that when someone opens their door, sounds like they're opening your door.",Richard T
40,Fun for a day!,"We went to Chill on new year and it was not very crowded. We were late as per scheduled time but they accommodated without any questions. They gave parkas but we prepared ourselves based on some finding on google knowing how cold it can be. Must not forget some cap and gloves.Ice sculptures are nice and kids enjoy a lot. I have a 9-month old and she was mostly looking around. Not much for a kid if he/she is not walking but they can still look at different lights. Also if you are not interested on riding the Queen Mary replica and inner tube, can quickly follow to exit. There are many more sculptures on the way out. Overall it was nice experience. I would have liked for some more activities for young kids but there are plenty for others.",2amitprakash
30,might be more fun if it went out to sea,"Not that exciting. The tour is quick, the food is mediocre and the view is very limited. The boat is very old, so the furnishings are run down. Your not out to sea, so there is not much to see from the ship that you can't see from the harbor. Inside it is a little musty smelling. The gift shop doesn't have much of anything. And if there is a ""ghost"" around, he didn't come out while we were there,",mariachurchill
50,Tea Room is Lovely,"My mom was in visiting from Boston and we had tickets to see the Princess Diana exhibit...this was actually a very well done exhibit on England's recent royalty (Queen Mary and after) and there was a TON of memorabilia commemorating everything from christenings to jubilees. Tastefully done...we arrived at 11:00 and barely had time to finish before our 12:45 Tea Room reservation which we were able to extend to 1:15. I would allow 3 hours, more if you like to read all of the newspaper articles, etc.The Tea Room itself was a lovely experience. Our waiter, whose name escapes me at the moment (Paul?) was very attentive in a VERY busy room (we think there was an engagement party going on) and gave us the inside scoop on the renovation of the tea room. It was previously, back in the QM heyday, a bankers' room - black and dark - a dramatic departure from its current regal gray and white decor. The chairs are gorgeous as well....at $500 a piece they should be! Intricately carved and beautifully upholstered.The menu was limited, but we were both satisfied with a delicious chicken gumbo soup. Mom had a roast beef sandwich (half) and I had half the shrimp salad with a delectable green goddess dressing...yum.For dessert, we EACH had a slice of their red velvet cake which was heavenly. The cake being very moist (not too red) and a creamy buttercream frosting...outstanding.Overall, a lovely day.",J M
40,The Tea Room on the Queen Mary,"When we visited the Queen Mary we chose the Tea Room for lunch. It is a lovely room with good service and good food and the price is moderate in comparison to the other restaurants on board. White tablecloths, lovely china and a great pot of tea were welcome additions.Afterwards, you have a historical trip to the past. Remember during WWII our Military were transported on this ship, sleeping in hammocks, and remember this ship was the model for the movie ""Poseidon adventure"", bringing back grand the scenes (if you haven't seen this old film, see it first). The Queen Mary is still a Grand Old Lady.",Darla525
10,what a disappointment!,"The self guided tour, after a long wait for tickets, was a joke! We walked all over trying to find the headsets for the tour. The little signage that there was was wrong. When we finally found someone who worked there, they also said that the audio tour sucked and the map was entirely inadequate! We walked all around, got lost a number of times, and rarely found anyone to ask for help. This place needs serious work, and new signs. The ticket process is slow and tedious. Save your money.",fly2muchDAL
10,A tourist trap,"The pricing structure is set up to confuse you and get the most money from you. We wanted the basic tour. The ticket agent initially refused to sell the basic tour. Instead she tried to upswell us to a tour including the ghost tour and something else. We don't believe in ghost, and were not interested in the other option. She then sold us the basic tour. This saved us close to 40 dollars.The tour itself focused on a timeline of the queen Mary and some ship models. The brochure was not clear as to what was where. We would have liked to have seen cabins and other travel spaces. We didn't see cabins. The most interesting area was on deck 4. There were some restaurants and shops there.The parking cost 15 dollars. This was a rip off from beginning to end.",Steve4040
40,dining on board,we had dinner at the Promenade. good view of the harbor/marina/downtown areas. get the dining voucher then eat at any of the on ship dining facilities and the cost you paid for the voucher is credited toward your bill. good deal. abd you can visit the shops also. would do it again.,okfine9
40,Great Wedding Venue - the Chapel at the Queen Mary,"On Christmas Eve we had the pleasure of attending a wedding at the Queen Mary. I have been on the ship several times, it is a fascinating place for history buffs, romantics, and the lovers of the paranormal, so if you have never been to the Queen Mary, please go. There is much to see, a variety of tours to take, restaurants and great view of the harbor. This was the first time I was on the Queen Mary for something other than a tour, the chapel was beautiful. It is small and elegant. The dinner and reception was in one of the old ballrooms, and was equally elegant. The food was good, the service was impeccable. My water glass ( i was not drinking ) never even got to be half empty, the waiters are that attentive. I highly recommend this as a spot for holding weddings. there is a fee for the tours, but not to enter to see the wedding.",Laura R
40,I Really Liked It Here!,"After having a terrible experience at a LA hotel, I was so happy to come to Long Beach and get to stay here for a night. The room was amazing. The history is amazing. While there we did Chill and a tour. It was all really good. My family enjoyed it and we had a really good time.Just as a warning for folks thinking about the ""Ghost and Legends"" tour though-- it's not what you think it is, but they don't tell you that when you buy the tickets. It's a haunted house set up with a lot of screaming and stuff that sprays you in the face etc. We thought it was a walking tour and took the whole lot of kids. They all were fine through it (it's not that scary), but it was not what I thought and not quite how the ad presented it. It was entertaining, just different.",Jessica H
50,Queen Mary,I was very pleased to find that the Queen Mary was within walking distance of our hotel. It was amazing to see the legend in person and stopped for a drink at their bar. I was more impressed when I returned from my own cruise and was in awe of such a beautiful ship built so many years ago. It was well worth the price of admission.,JanetteA980
40,Chill and the Queen Mary,"We got a great deal via Goldstar--$10 tickets. For the price it was cute. We hadn't been to the Queen Mary in 15 years, and what was shops are mostly offices, and so there are tents with additional activities and options. The ice sculptures are truly amazing and the slides are a hit with the kids. Bring warm gloves. The parkas help, but nothing cures bone-chilling cold once your hands hurt. The actual frozen room can be done in 20 minutes or so--less if anyone in your party is not a fan of cold.The big perk was that we gained free admission to the Queen Mary after our brief foray into frozenness. The kids loved the experience (engine room and the propeller were big hits) and we spent several hours on the ship. Skip the pizza and cocoa outside at Chill and head over to the ship for a relaxing meal with real forks and coffee with refills.Parking was a bit prohibitive, but here's a tip: Lunch in one of the restaurants on board, and get between 3 hours or more for a reduced rate (or free--check the QM website for the parking deals with each restaurant).In terms of a history lesson and appeal for all ages, this is a winner, and it can be done on a budget. Enjoy!",halobb
50,Chill at the Queen,"The Queen Mary has Chill, an ice palace inside the old Spruce Goose dome. It is 10 degrees. They give you parkas. Everything is made out of ice. You walk through and explore the local scenes, animals, and Christmas decorations. You can buy ice tubing and ice skating. It is cold!! But it is really neat to see. Your ticket gets you on the Queen, too. Not cheap, $20 for parking, and tubing and skating costs more.",JeffBransford
40,Beautiful old ship,"The city of Long Beach has taken excellent care of the old girl. My brother and I made a 4th of July visit a number of years ago. We did the 'haunted' tours, which were fun. Plus, I learned the Queen Mary played a distinguished role in WW II.Our parents met on the Queen Mary, so that made it special.",Livia E
30,The events are really great if you're willing to stand in line.,"I have been to The Queen Mary twice. Once for the Dark Harbor Halloween event and once for the Christmas Chill event. I have not yet taken one of the regular ship tours that are offered year-round.The haunted mazes at Dark Harbor were well done, and I've been to a lot of haunted houses in LA. However, the staff was not prepared for the number of people that showed up (and this was a Sunday night, mind you). We stood in line for about 45 minutes just to get inside the gates. Then it was 90 minutes in line for each maze. They kept making conflicting announcements changing the closing time, so we weren't sure exactly when the event was closing. We stuck it out till about midnight, and by that time enough of the people cleared that we were able to get into some of the mazes right away. Ultimately we went through 4 of the 6 mazes. This is one event where I think paying the extra $20 for a front of the line pass is really worth it. Otherwise, you'll be cranky spending most of your time standing around and you won't feel like you got your money's worth.Again, the lines were an issue at Chill. We already had tickets, just needed to pick them up at Will Call, and we stood in line for about 40 minutes. In fact, there were two ticket booth banks and we stood in the wrong line for about 20 minutes because it was completely unclear where to go. We thought Chill would just be something we did for a couple hours, but it's really an all-day event. The line for the Ice Kingdom was at least half an hour. The Ice Kingdom itself was very impressive (great photo ops!), and it's so cold they give you a special coat to wear over your own. But wear warm socks and tennis shoes and bring gloves!! My fingers were absolutely frozen from taking pictures inside. If you get tickets for the ice tubing, which is pretty fun, they give you a bracelet with tear-off tabs so you can go 5 times. BUT you have to get back in line after each go. So to get in those 5 times, you'll likely spend an hour for a 15 second ride. The ice skating did not have a line and the ice wasn't too crowded. You can rent these really cute orange seals to push your kids (or yourself) around on for an extra $5. It's really hard to find a good size fit with the rental skates though.A note about parking... Be prepared to pay $15 - $20 to park there, depending on the event. If you're going solo or just with one other person, the cost of tickets and parking might not be worth it to you. So try to get as big a group in one car as you can. If you're going with small children (or fidgety friends), bring some snacks or entertainment for the long lines. And get there early!",Trysta B
40,Really Cool Idea,"We stayed one night on The Queen Mary. I love history, so of course I'm going to say I had a great time here. The room service was EXCELLENT. The service all around was very, very good...from valet, to bell hop, to front desk, to room service. The room is very small, the tub is teeny tiny, and the sink is small, but that's to be expected knowing how old the ship is. The only real down side was that the walls are very thin and my husband and I woke up to a screaming baby at 6am, and unfortunately couldn't go back to sleep after that. It sounded like the baby was in our bathroom, thats' how thin the walls are. Other than that, it was an really cool experience.",Robyn G
50,Tea time,"Tea time! home made everything - scones, clotted creme, exellent finger sandwiches"" - make sure you are hungry - (the team menu probably not for small kids since its on the higher priced end)",TravelwKids4
30,Just another big ship,"It's fun to see, but nothing unique in this day of cruise ships. When I went it looked like they could only afford to maintain parts of it. If you go, see the real Russian submarine adjacent. Far more interesting.",suz91101
40,Chill!,"My family went to the Chill exhibit at the Queen Mary. We saved $6 per person using a Grouopon ($19 instead of $24.95). Even though the Groupon stated that we must make reservations, it was full for the day we wanted to go. Because so many Groupons were sold, the next open weekend reservations was in 2 weeks. I called Queen Mary, and the representative said since I bought a ticket, they have to honors it, so just come in today.The Ice Kingdom was numbingly cold at 9 degrees Fahrenheit (they lend you a parka, but I should have brought gloves and a scarf). I always take tons of pictures, but after 5 minutes inside, my fingers and nose went numb, and I couldn't take anymore pictures. It was very unique and beautiful. There was ice castles, ice queen, ice nativity scene, and little ice slides (that you must borrow a parka to slide down) and many other ice sculptures. My 9 year old daughter and I also went down a big 40ft ice slide on inner tubes ($14.70 per person for 5 rides). You must sign a waiver, but it was fun and you turn in the inner tube as you slide down the ice hill.Afterwards, we walked around Queen Mary and ate lunch at Chelsea Chowder House. The clam chowder and views were spectacular. Michael was a very attentive server and brought us 5 bowls of clam chowder when we only ordered two and asked for 3 more empty bowls to share. The chowder was creamy and full of clams in every bite! The hot soup tasted awesome after being numbingly cold inside the Ice Kingdom.This day trip was great fun for us since we don't usually do any snow activities being natives in Orange County. I would highly recommend this for your family.",Matthew J
50,The highlight of our Long Beach trip,"Wonderful experience touring the Queen Mary! What a stately, lovely reminder of the beautiful old ships. Incredible teak floors and furnishings from the 40's. Seeing the Captains quarters and the bridge were fascinating. Don't miss visiting the unique shops and stopping for an afternoon cup of tea and scones. But be sure to take the Ghosts of the Queen Mary Tour. Really interesting, scary and very awesome!!! Not for children or the timid. The tour guide is unbelievably good, very authentic and a little frightening. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience on the Queen Mary!",happy4travel
40,Lunch and a Tour post cruise,"After disembarking our cruise we had several hours to kill before needing to head to the airport. So we walked over from the Inspiration, there is a walk through area we saw that was getting set up for the holidays. The person who greeted us at the entrance to the Queen Mary was friendly & helpful, she told us that since we had cruised with Carnival that we could walk on to the Queen Mary and do a self guided tour for free. We chose to do a guided tour instead, but there was still a discount with showing our Sail & Sign card. We had lunch in the dining room, prices seemed a bit steep but the food was good. I had a turkey Reuben, the waiter said no problem to switching out the corned beef with turkey. And I have to say that it was 3x as good (and bigger) than the reubens I had had on the ship.After lunch we went on the Ghost encounter tour (there are 2 ghost type tours offered, this is the more detailed one with no ""special effects."") It lasted an hour, and we saw many areas of the ship & got some history beyond just ghost reports or sitings. The fellow giving the tour did a good job, if I take another tour though I think I will go for a general tour or the WWII one next time.",tink360
50,Art Deco heaven!,Take the ghost tour. Great fun! What a fabulous ship to tour! Would return. Easy parking. Loved it! The hotel probably would be fun to stay at!,jmjesq
40,Splendid ship turned into a hotel & attraction,"Ship is moored on a quay quite a distance from Long Beach waterfront but there is a free hop on hop off bus that takes you right there. It was interesting to see the splendour of of the ""Queen"" & have an idea of what cruising was like in her day. The Wireless Room was particularly good with staff on hand to demonstrate how morse code was used.",ColinManchesterUK
30,Visit for historical sake only,"There's obviously no money to keep this ship in better shape. So, overlook that and enjoy a piece of history.",terrynkathy
40,Retro Royalty,"Take the tours, study the decor, appreciate the wood, tile, brass, and all the nostalgia--even the bathrooms are something to see. You can't help wondering about all the notables who have moved through the halls and all the stories the walkways could tell. Take your time and really savor the history. Art students, design students, history buffs, people who appreciate the quality of real craftsmanship, there's a lot to see here. It will inspire your own sense of decor. My friend met her husband here.",D S
40,Interesting tour if you visit Long Beach,"The Queen Mary, a 1030's era luxury ocean liner, is larger than the Titanic, and has been in port at Long Beach longer than she was a sea. In addition to the opulence (for example, 5 of the precious woods used on board are now extinct), the most interesting facts to me were concerning the time she spent as a troop-transport ship. She carried 16,000 troops sleeping in rotating 24-hour bed spaces - seems impossible when you tour. If you book ahead, you can stay in one of the staterooms for a reasonable price.",C W
40,Great little slice of history in LB,"Definitely worth the effort. Whether you want a historical tour, a ghost tour (really - there are ghosts on the ship), a lovely hotel, or bruch at Sir Winston's, you will not be disappointed.",Alexander_Designs
40,Romantic birthday weekend.,Although we only spent one day and night aboard it couldn't have been better. We arrived several hours before our reservation to enjoy lunch and a tour of the ship prior to checking in our room. Luncheon at the Tea Room and dinner at Sir Winston's are most memorable.,Richard H
50,Princess Di,"Our last visit was for the Princess Di exhibit. Impressive collection of dresses, private notes from the royal family, photos and family items. Afterwards I took my son to tour the ship. We met a Captain walking around. My son was very impressed. My husband met us in the main lobby and we had a drink at the bar. What a fantastic view!",TheKurtzKrew
50,A Glimpse of An Earlier Time,"I was really looking forward to my night on the QM and I wasn't disappointed.I am delighted to note that the city and others have spent an absolute fortune in firstly buying and then maintaining this wonderful old Cunarder. Almost since arrival in Long Beach there have have been successive managements trying, usually without success, to make the attraction economically viable. At the moment the future appears more stable and secure and I understand there are some 1.5 million visitors annually. Despite this footfall, the fabric of the ship has been very well looked after and, of course, this is enlightened self-interest.I would definitely recommend the guided tour and we were fortunate to benefit from the expertise of a passionate and long serving crew man (whose wife refers to the ship as ""the other woman""). We learned much of the history of the boat from its build at John Browns, its sailing characteristics, how it got the name QM (I won't spoil it) its role as troop ship (its record compliment of over 16,000 troops still stands) and of course insights into the VIP's who did, and did not, sail in her.We were shown around the ship and into most of the more important salons and state rooms and marvelled at the elegance of the fittings, decorations and sheer workmanship displayed.Our stateroom was very comfortable and, apart from the flat screen TV, was I imagined just as it might have been in the thirties.Plenty of places to eat and refresh on board and the tea room is especially noteworthy. This is a quiet haven, with discrete understated decor with staff and service of a different standard to the norm ashore.One point of excitement occured when the fire alarm sounded in the early morning which thankfully was a false alarm. I hope they clapped the careless smoker in irons. I don't think you'd be disappointed by a visit.There is a free shuttle bus which runs between the birth and the city centre and the very helpful and friendly drivers are more than happy to assist you in finding the best of Long Beach.because the huge number number of visitors",Rogeradl
40,"Great way to spend time, alone or otherwise","I tagged along with my husband on one of his work trips, so I toured the QM solo and really enjoyed it! While there (July 2012) Princess Di's evening gowns were on display - exhibit included a lot of interesting info about The Queen and The Queen Mum - a must-see for Anglophiles! I wandered around by myself, but noticed there are also guided tours. Really enjoyed simply sitting on the deck, taking in the gorgeous views of Long Beach.",wordy76
40,Consider bicycling to the Queen Mary - save $20 parking fee,I didn't know much about the ship before I visited. My main comment is that you can bike there to save the $20 parking fee.,movieglue
40,So Cool,"It's a really cool getting to eat or be entertained on this classic old ship. Besides being located in Long Beach which has a really great vibe down near the water, the Queen Mary really puts you in a place and time long gone.",Geoffrey S
40,It is very old,It is a cool old ship but could use some money put into it. The best part is just walking around it and see all the old decor compared to the mega ships of today,jaynbutch
50,Dark Harbor...Super Scary fun!,"I have no words for this event, Queen Mary's Dark Harbor. The amount of time and preparation that must have gone into that event is beyond extravagant. The mazes were absolutely breathtaking, to a horror movie fan that is. It was as if you stepped into a horror movie! Every maze was unique and so creative. Having the event on an already haunted ship just added to the macabre atmosphere. Some of the monsters they had lurking around were of the nautical theme, which I thought was great being that we are at the Queen Mary. I also loved how they tied in the ""real ghost stories"" that the ship has to tell into the mazes. For example, the story about the ""girl in white"" who has been seen near the swimming pool....yeah, she was there! So ingenious! I asked one of the workers the secret to all this, and he informed me that there is a director that actually works with the monsters, guiding them as to how to act! More ingenious! Whoever is in charge of putting this event together has got some imagination and innovation. It was absolutely awesome and I can't wait to go next year! I might add that the staff was very accommodating, as I was with my friend who had sprained her ankle. They gave us a wheel chair to use, free of charge. Two mazes were wheel chair friendly, while the 4 others she had to hobble through. This event was well organized, professional and they spared no expense! Oh! Don't forget...GET THE FRONT OF THE LINE PASS! It's a little extra $$ but not bad. The lines were hours long. Definitely splurge for it.",Sleepyhollow420
30,Not as I expected,"I thought there would be more to see on the ship. I never received a headset for the self guided tour and I found myself kind of roaming around aimlessly wondering if I had seen all there was to see. I also did the Ghosts and legends tour, and although it was a bit corny, it was funny and took me by surprise.",Nancy8041
50,Time Travel,"History is alive on the Queen Mary. It was wonderful to stroll along and think about all of the famous people who traveled on it, her service during WWII, and enjoy dining there. Very gracious surroundings...",Joangoodcook
40,Nice visit,"Still a local landmark, unfortunately you could see signs of wear and tear around the ship. You would think as much money it costs to see the place, they would redo the floors and add a bit of paint.",Mystic V
40,An historical gem,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the majestic Queen Mary, on which so many notable people have travelled in the past - The Queen Mother, Winston Churchill etc. Part of the ship is now a hotel. In the museum section of the ship, I loved seeing all the different classes of sleeping cabins and eating facilities from the past, especially a typical room where the 22,000 GI brides& children would have travelled to the States after WW2. You could also imagine what it must have been like aboard the Titanic. The museum was very informative and interesting. It was great seeing the interior Art Deco features of the ship too. We also did the 'Ghost tour' which was ok and quite fun to see the old swimming pool down in the depths of the ship. Younger chidren were a little scared when the lights were turned out on this tour. It was good to relax on deck, experiencing what it must have been like to undertake one of the 1001 5day weekly voyages from Southampton to New York . This visit was the best thing about Long Beach for me.",TravellingThrough100
40,So Cal Highlights; Restaurant and Attraction,"If you go to Southern California be sure to make time to visit the historic and magestic Queen Mary.They have great reataurants and also a hotel, but just a visit to have lunch and tour the vessel, museum and tourist shop is a real treat.Enjoy!",Stephen A
50,Old World Charm!,"What a wonderful hotel! We booked a room for three guests, and paid about $180 for the night. It was a little steep, but what a beautiful ship! Normally to do the tours, eat, or walk through it you have to buy tickets. However, staying there opens up the ship to walking around and eating without first buying those tickets and waiting in the long lines. Our room was much, much larger than expected. It had 2 big bedrooms and 1 bath. Definitely had the old feel to it, which made it so much better! I would recommend staying here again! I will say, through no fault of the hotel, that the walls were thin (of course they were, it is a ship from the 40's!) We had some very rude neighbors next to us. Every time we talked normally, they would scream at us to shut the **** up. Staff was friendly, restaurants and bars were really expensive. Other than that, beautiful ship with a beautiful history!",MonkeyBoy03
50,Love this place!,I just love the Queen Mary. She's an amazing ship with an even more amazing history. Don't miss out on the opportunity to take the tour!,Tamara C
50,A wonderful ship,We went on the ghosts of the Queen Mary tour which was pretty scary but well done. My only quibble is that as we were the last tour of the day there were no audio headsets available after the ghost tour was finished. We went round on our own and as it was later in the day the decks were almost empty and we could really savour the atmosphere.,AtravellerEssex
30,Brrr!,It was freezing cold inside. So much that we couldn't wait to get out of the Princess Diana exhibit. I would advise you to wear a warm jacket if you visit there.,dianna h
10,"Urgh! Calling this an ""attraction"" is stretching the truth","Spare me, please! This place cost about USD24 each to enter an old smelly badly maintained cruise ship. There was no guide supplied just a map with a few scribbles about what to ""see"". But seriously the best thing about this floating box is the view from it. It was kind of creepy too. We asked about the audio guide - for an additional charge - the customer service person in charge of them said, and I quote ""they have not been updated for a very long time and are not really worth it, I suggest you get lost on your own"". Hmmm. It was okay but the shops were twee, maybe not if you are from the US but to English people the scottish heritage shop is just silly.",Lucyboom

50,Truly unique experience,"Staying aboard this grand lady who once traversed the Atlantic and took troops to battle was a truly unique experience. Enjoyed the ship's ambiance and the ability to revisit the travel experience from a bygone day. Our cabin, containing many of it's original features, was charming (each stateroom is a little different). The tubs are very narrow and the water pressure for showering leaves a bit to be desired. The staff were very accommodating and helpful and consistently went above and beyond to ensure a positive experience. Maintenance came to repair our a/c and even went to the front desk and returned with a new room key when he found out one of ours was not working! We really enjoyed our stay!",WanderOne79
40,Enjoyed Just Wandering,"Rather than taking one of the tours, I bought a $15 ticket, which enabled me to explore the Queen Mary on my own and I received a $15 dining credit. The food wasn't special, but the atmosphere was novel. I was satisfied with my choice to look around on my own, relying on signs for information. People desiring a lot of information may not be. I rode a red Passport bus for free from downtown.",Mary1675
40,Nice Just Tour But Great Restaurants,The tour is really great and well worth the price especially when they have the Titanic exhibits going on. Parking is easy with lots of room. But the hidden treasure is their restaurants. Some of the best food in Long Beach. Their restaurants are great for couples but a bit pricey for families.,kevin p
40,Much better than anticipated!,"We visited the Queen Mary and did the basic passport for $25. Whilst I found the audio tour a little confusing to follow, the information was very good and is was fabulous just to wander around the decks. We were slightly sceptical about the Ghosts and Legends Tour but it was very well done and worth seeing. The most interesting bit however has to seeing the remaining propeller by actually leaving the ship to see it in the water (hard to explain in writing!).Very good attraction and well worth a visit.",TGBWorcestershire
50,The old lady,It was very easy to see and access and the buses were free to get there... but it was Very expensive even just to take a walking tour of the ship,Phish56
30,Watch out for the Parking Kiosks!! Bring Cash for Parking!!,"Pros-I enjoyed the Diana exhibit and wandering around the ship was great. I would love to see the ship fully restored - I believe if it was fully restored, it would have a much higher rating among all reviewers. When we showed up to the ticket booth, staff was extremely friendly and helpful.Cons-The drinks at the bar are pricey! The drink tasted good, but three cocktails (including tip) costs around $36.00. Also, leaving the parking lot is a nightmare. When leaving the parking lot, you are forced to pay at kiosks. The one on the far left is manned by a person and does not take credit cards. We went to a machine to pay with our credit card and the machine would not accept the ticket. This happened to a number of people in front of us. We had to put the car in reverse and back up to the manned kiosk. It took the car in front of us several minutes to find enough cash to pay the fee...while searching for cash the attendant was going to make 10 cars back up and have the person go to a credit card kiosk. Luckily, the person found cash and my group had cash on hand as well. Very confusing. (When we arrived at the ship, I overheard someone say to pay for parking before you get to your car, because the self service kiosks always act up. Wish I had remembered this before getting to my car). As a tip for other visitors, bring about $20 in cash for parking so you can get out of the lot much faster.",Krisanc19
40,"For Halloween, stay at the Queen Mary","It was a bit noisy with the haunted waterfront going on outside, we did not participate in that, but had dinner at Winstons and walked the deck. Then the next day did a tour of the ship, imagining that we were on a voyage to London. It was interesting to see the inside of the vessel. When I was but a child, I took a cruise on American President lines to Hongkong and Japan, that was a long trip but it was well worth it because I got to truly experience how those people Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr felt on their voyage from London on ""An Affair to Remember"". You have to cherish these experiences and keep them alive in your heart, because truly no one else has had them. YOu are fortunate if you are able to do this.",LizC2012

20,Princess Diana Exhibit / Dining at The Tea Room,"The Princess Diana Exhibit should be called the Royal Family Exhibit, mostly newspaper articles / handwritten notes with a handful of Diana's gowns. The exhibit area is VERY COLD to preserve fabrics and papers, and you're not told that up front so you rush through the exhibit because you're frozen. The tea menu at the adjacent (also COLD) Tea Room is one of either conflicting flavors or of tasteless food and does not consist of traditional English tea sandwiches. Did I mention the 'Tea' is WAY overpriced? $160.00 for four of us. I don't recommend this experience.",shari81048
50,Group dinner on the Queen Mary,"We bussed 130 people to the Queen Mary for a group dinner. All were impressed with the ship, dining room and meal. Excellent gathering.",WillRogers
50,Dark Harbor..Wow,"My 1st time ever to visit the Queen Mary, but it was more of The Dark Harbor theme they had that i went to. I was amaze of the 6 different haunted spots you can go thru. They had a band out playing, plus plenty of food, beverages, shops and lots of zombies and monsters luring around. I really enjoyed myself out there. Loved it and will go again with no doubt.",LGriss
20,What did they do to this tour?!,"Over the last few years something has happened to this tour.The 35 minute ghost and legends tour is really a waste of money.Now the haunted encounters was one of my favorite tours. It gives you an opportunity to actually be on the floor down in the pool area. This is great however, when you have a group of 30 people, not so great. If you want to improve this tour and give people a bang for there buck, no more than 12 per group.Also where did Valerie go? She was the best tour guide on this ship. Instead you give me some guy name Danny, who thinks he is Chris Farley! And if you don't want me to know what kind of novice you really are don't tell me you have been working there for 7 weeks.If you are really interested in doing a paranormal walk thru, try one of the events later in the evening, it costs more money, but you will get more out of it. Be advised with Dark Harbor been run in october, some of these evening events may not be available.To the management, the paranormal activity on this ship is special. Try making it a bit less commercial and more scientific. People would pay a little more, if they knew they were getting something of quality and not some sort of amusement ride with a 3rd class tour guide (i.e. Danny).",Peter Barbounis
40,October is a great time to visit!,"What a beautiful shoip, they don;t make them like this anymore! We took the Haunted tour and saw some of the highlights of the ship. Cute shops on board and restaurants. During October for an additional fee they have huge haunted house type tours in the evenings.",LauraY23
30,Novelty value!,My boyfriend and I recently did a road trip around California. We were on a budget and opted for cheap and cheerful accommodation; somewhere to put our heads down for a night or 2. We appreciate that you get what you pay for and so would have been happy as long as it was clean and functional.We opted for the Queen Mary because it was something a bit different and for novelty! The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful. We had opted for an indoor room (no window) but were upgraded at check in free of charge.It is a little bit dated; but that's part of the novelty. It is clean and a decent enough size. There is not much around the ship but there is a bus from right outside that takes you round longbeach.It was novel for a night and not a bad option if you want to stay somewhere out of LA. There are some really nice restaurants and bars in Longbeach as well.,Jenny B
30,Prices too high,"Tour prices are exorbitant, which is unfortunate, as the ship is quite interesting. We skipped the tours and bought $15 dining vouchers that allowed us access to a restaurant. Food was adequate, service was very slow, but it gave us time to enjoy the views.",Chris S
40,Afternoon Tea on the Queen,Extremely civilised afternoon on the Queen Mary. A lovelly way to pass a few hours in Los Angeles. The afternoon tea in true American fashion is huge...... Princess Diana's outfits are on display and snippets of history all around. One minor gripe is that the afternoon tea while I was there included rock buns that they called scones with lemon curd. Pay a fee to get in which you use towards your restaurant bill.,sooz2757
30,Just OK,I was just average for me! My kids loved it but i was not all that impressed! There were nats flying around everywhere including the area where you eat and everything was old and dingy looking! It was nice to get to see everything and the history but i don't think i would go there again!,Sam P
40,If you have a complaint,"My family and I stayed on the Queen Mary in July 2012. The stay was wonderful and a very pleasant experience. However we had problems when booking our tour tickets on-line. We tried to sort it out on board ship but unfortunately they couldn't help us. After we got home we emailed The Queen Mary to explain that we had had to pay twice for tour tickets and wanted a refund. After 5 weeks and numerous emails we eventually got an email, then more emails as they then went quiet again and after about 10 weeks we got a partial refund. We are still waiting for the rest of our refund and no response. My review is that if you have a problem make sure you sort it out while on board as they won't respond via email.",MeggQ45
20,"no directions, apathetic staff, interesting history","Came here for the first time with my friend and her mother; my friend had come a few years ago and raved about the experience. Apparently, a few years ago, management had changed for the worse.We purchased the tour ticket that included the free haunted tour, and this is where the trouble began. Right off the bat, the tour guide was stressing that everything we were about to see was fake/special effects. Then at almost every turn the guide through the haunted tour continuously breaking the fourth wall to remind us that she does this tour umpteen times a day. That completely ruined being able to go along with the stories. Okay, I get it, say it once so those that are easily frightened can be reassured, or decide its not for them, but once it starts, let us try to actually absorb into the experience.Anyways, that ends, and they just let us wander into a random room on the ship (near where the on-ship chapel is) and tell us we are free to roam the ship. No direction on how to get back to the main museum area, where to pick up the audio tour, just go wander, have fun.We end up walking the length of the ship at least 3 times through the hotel trying to find our way, try to go find one part of the ship only to find the only way to get to it was blocked by a wedding party taking pictures.We finally stumble upon where we started the ghost tour and find the information window. We express our obvious disappointment at the experience thus far and all we get is a lame ""what do you want me to do? management changed a few years ago"" response. She does, reluctantly, direct us to the main museum area, making it painfully obvious that we should have been able to figure that out for ourselves. Really? We were left off in a random part of the ship and there were no signs whatsoever. We also have come to find out that it's down the elevator and down at one far end of the ship. Yup, really intuitive.Okay, finally make it to the museum, and find it to be really interesting and a wonderfully immersive glimpse into a by-gone world. However, because of all the unnecessary walking we did earlier, we were short on time and just exhausted, so we couldn't explore the whole thing. Additionally, there were some real lack of direction through the engine rooms and we again were wondering if we had accidentally stumbled into an area we weren't supposed to be in.This attraction is right next to the Soviet submarine ""Scorpion"" and while I would be interested in exploring that on a future visit, I really don't want to give any more money to the company that ""manages"" these attractions.",Blue_Ladybug_MD
40,Authentic Queen Mary,"We walked to the Queen Mary and had a couple of drinks and then dinner. The bar was very hot so we had to move outside, which was OK. Then we ate at the casual restaurant, very good and not too expensive. The Queen Mary is fun to walk around, cruise ships of the past!",Cathy W
50,Amazing history and believe it or not it has a few surprises,"I visited the ship for one night, two days over July 4. The ship's history is amazing. It's fascinating to wander the entire ship and even more interesting to stay the night. I stayed on B deck and had what I can only describe as a unique evening and night. While I am not one to engage in hyperbole what many say about the ship is in fact true. It really is haunted. This of course is not why I stayed there. To celebrate July 4 on the ship is unique in itself. I consider what happened as an added bonus. The staff are rather matter-of-fact to have guests report unusual occurrences. They will tell you many guests report seeing and or hearing unexplained things. I recommend staying as a guest on the ship. Who knows, you might be as surprised as I was.",cloust
30,Very interesting but pricey,"Fascinating to see this classic cruise liner - great wooden decks and stair cases, good selection of restaurants and cafe/bar. But only takes one or two hours to tour round at a leisurely pace, including a coffee break. Princess Diana exhibition was similarly interesting but mostly random letters and plates/mugs and a few dresses. Didn't manage to keep me interested for long. All a very interesting experience but pricey ($34 each) for a few hours entertainment.",Wainwright R
50,FUN TRIP TO THE QUEEN MARY,Food and service and cool companions.....made a mistake and paid too much and my money was already waiting for me when I returned.,Frankie H
30,More of a tourist trap than a historical landmark,"My husband wanted to surprise me with a visit to the Queen Mary as part of our vacation, and he booked a package online (the Ghost Tour/general tour). We battled rush-hour traffic to park and finally found the one open ticket window across the parking lot. The attendant there seemed to have a hard time locatng our reservation, and then we were told that we would be able to go on the Ghost Tour only, as the Queen Mary closes at 7 PM (my husband did not see this anywhere on the website). We had missed the start of the Ghost Tour by this time, so my husband asked if he could just downgrade our ticket to the self-tour. He was finally given a name to contact to get a partial refund on his credit card. Altogether, we spent about 25 minutes at the ticket window. The attendant was nice enough to comp us $30 on a meal in any restaurant on board for our trouble, however.We checked in with one of the restaurants to ask about the vouchers and were told that reservations were really only necessary for larger parties. We then spent a couple hours looking around the boat. It had some interesting points of interest, but was fairly confusing without a tour guide (and it did look tired in certain areas). We returned to the restaurant, which seemed to be emptying out. We were told a large party would be coming in soon and it would probably take 30+ minutes before we could be seated. We continued our self-tour, and then spotted a tour that was currently in progress. We have no idea why the woman at the window told us there were no tours after 7.We returned to the restaurant after about 35 minutes and were seated right away. The dinner was good, although predictably overpriced.The biggest negative was the parking. As we went to leave, we found out self-parking cost $15, and in order to validate our ticket, we would have needed to have eaten in a restaurant within 3 hours of first receiving the ticket (we had missed that window of time). None of this was explained to us and we did not see any signage when first driving in.This left a definite sour note on what could have been a nice evening.",WClark1313
30,interesting but costly,"Interesting to tour,but don;t go on the ghost tour,very silly-waste of time-better to go on your own with rent tour guides",atraveler300
40,Great overall experience!,"I stayed here for a business trip to enjoy a unique experience...I did... At 2am I heard a beautiful piano piece, short though it was....I had heard the ship was haunted and enjoyed every minute of my piano serenade.... Only wish it was not at 2am....service was great and can't wait to go visit again.....DJ",Denise J
50,Awesome piece of history,"I stayed in the hotel aboard ship for almost a whole week for my 21st birthday, and it was fantastic! The staff are very nice, the rooms are a bit cramped, but everything has been kept so true to the original design, the little discomforts are well worth it. The observation bar is phenomenal, and the view of the harbor is very picturesque. And yes, this place is haunted, to boot. Take the tour, you'll find out for yourself...",d3vilkitten
40,"Historical, glamorous, something for (almost) everyone","My husband, 9 year old daughter and I toured the Queen Mary when we were in Long Beach this summer. My husband was most interested, so to help get our daughter engaged, we let her choose the tour. She wanted to do the Ghosts and Legends and Haunted Encounters tours, so we acquiesced even though we would have chosen the Princess Diana package instead. I don't recommend the tour we took if your children get spooked at all, ours ended up not enjoying it as much as we hoped, but we did get to see some areas of the ship that we wouldn't have otherwise so it all worked out. We could really imagine the glamour of travel by ocean liner and enjoyed our time there. After our tour, we got snacks and cold drinks at the Observation Bar, which is an art deco bar that was originally the first class lounge. The service and food here were both good, and we continued to enjoy our imaginary voyage. I would definitely go back and take a different tour next time.",Dana S
20,Old & Dirty,"My family thought the Queen Mary would be more historic with a lot more to see/tour. The ship is dirty, in need of repair. I was hoping for some sort of themed souvenir but the options on board were of old, faded, overpriced junk that mostly had nothing to do with the ship (lots of knock off miscellaneous products from china). We ate at one of the restaurants for lunch it was dirty in need of repair and ultimately unmemorable.",Shane B
30,Tired but reminiscent of a time gone by,The ship is docked in Long Beach. One of the waiters told me the hotel part of the ship gets many visitors who are boarding or coming off cruise ships as it is right near the port. One friend who did stay there tells me the cabins are small but have incredible woodwork.As for touring the ship... It is a very tired ship sorely in need of restoration. The ballroom and wedding chapel must get plenty of bookings because they are in the best condition. I loved the blown up photos of celebrities of years ago onboard the ship. There is a mounted gun to remind us that during WWII the ship was used to transport troops.The admission and parking are both quite costly for what it is.,Nancy P
50,Great Place to Stay,"This was a highlight of our California trip. We stayed in a ""Deluxe Cabin King Bed Harbor View"" which is huge and has a great view out the twin portholes. The room is almost entirely wood paneled with original wood and has a real classy look and feel. Other people have mentioned noise, but maybe the staterooms have a better separation -- we didn't hear any noise from neighbors. It's great that hotel guests are free to walk around the ship and that there is a free shuttle bus every 15 minutes to downtown Long Beach. The bathroom is dated, of course, but it's the Queen Mary, after all. We highly recommend a stay here!",David W
40,Good to see this old queen,One of the old time liners now an hotel (expensive) and a tourist attraction. Being an hotel a lot of the ship is off limits to day visitors. Probably worth a couple of hours only. Easily reached from L A by MTA train and free shuttle bus at Long Beach end.,tankerton1944
50,TEA AT THE QUEEN MARY,"Papa and Noni took our nearly 5 year old grandaughter for tea right before her birthday, and she was about the only little girl there and they treated her ""royally"" including a great big butterfly cookie just for her and she loved it and said she wants to come again next year on her 6th birthday.Food was very nice and the view was gorgeous.We plan on an overnight visit and get her and her brother and parents to come too so we can all explore the ship and maybe even come for the Sunday Brunch which is really fantastic.",Joybells12
40,Nice restaurant,"We thought the overall experience great, the food wonderful, the service only so-so. The only real complaint is that despite having a dress code they allowed diners to be seated wearing clothes more appropriate to a fast food location.",OCProfessor
40,Expensive but BEST tour guide,"We did the world war II tour and had an amazing tour guide, he knew his stuff. He experience it!!! Very cool seeing the boat through his eyes. The boat is neat to see as well as the submarine but it is expensive. Not good for really young children, my two were bored.",HBsurferwife
50,Queen Mary Ghost and Legends Tour,"My daughters, cousins and I visited the Grand Queen Mary in Long Beach, Ca. We decided to purchase the Haunted Passport for $39.00. This included a 30 minute Ghost and Legends Tour and a 1 hour Haunted Encounters Tour and access on the ship. The Ghost and Legends Tour was fun and a little creepy. It was more like a haunted house attraction(strobe lights ,scary music, ect ). The Haunted Encounter Tour was my favorite. Our tour guide Danny was AWESOME!!! He was very patient with our group and had great charisma. He took us to all the hot spots where employees and guest have reported paranormal activity. One location was the old nursery, where people have heard children laughing. Oddly enough my daughter and I stayed behind to take pictures and the rest of the tour proceeded down the hall and out of nowhere we hear children laughing:O We also toured the engine room and Danny was telling us the history of that area and about a mechanic that used to work down there who passed. Some times guest will leave that area with a smudge of grease on them. At the end of the tour my daughter Lindsay said OMG! MOM!! something touched me and we made a Bee Line out of the engine room. When we got outside she had 2 smudges on her lower leg. We instantly were completely and totally freaked out! We are truly believers in the paranormal.",AJCE2GIRLS
40,Nice way to spend the afternoon.,"Took the passport bus over here (a must) for free, it took around 15 minutes from Pine Ave. Chose to pay $25 each for the basic entry and were sent upstairs to see the Ghosts and Legends tour- the introduction said that it was a 'haunted castle' experience. As my partner and I were on a limited schedule we decided to skip this, get the free audio tour and wander round ourselves. We had a lovely afternoon; there was enough information to get a feel for what travelling on the ship was like, and there were some good displays. We grabbed a coffee and cake which were a little overpriced but worth it for the location. I only wish that we'd had time for a cocktail at the bar, or sit down meal at one of the four restaurants.",Caroline GB
40,Unique part of history !,I totally enjoyed my visit to the queen Mary but should loved to have been able to at least see the inside of one of the hotel rooms !!!!,RACEDIVA07
20,A Grand Old Lady being spoiled and VERY Expensive,We visited the Queen Mary for the first time in September with 2 friends who had visited before in 2006. All 4 of us were hugely disappointed with the experience and have vowed never to return again.First - car parking at $15 is a complete rip off - there is a smaller charge if you stay less than 1 hour but once the time ticks over the hour then they hit you with the $15.There are several Package Options available -around 5 available with the cheapest being $24.95 - this included a self guided tour and the Ghosts and Legends Tour. The ticket sellers seems unwilling or unable to actually explain what the different experiences involved. Our package experience was a complete farce for reasons which include:1. Self Guided usually means there is some type of guidance - signs are tour guides to help - there was neither. The tour involves entering and leaving the ship to get from one area to another;2. There was a lack of historical information on many parts of the tour:3. The Ghosts and Legends is absolutley awful and the company who own the QM should hang their heads in shame. They have tried to glorify the deaths that occurred at sea on board but the audio comemtary is so awful that it is actually impossible to work out what on earth is going on.Food options on board are expensive - $11 for a Caprese salad that was (even for UK standards never mind US) quite small.The owners of the QM need to take a long hard look at what they are doing and if their visitor numbers are falling take heed of some of comments here. We have also visited the Royal Yacht in Scotland and that experience is truly wonderful.,JMTravels24
20,Ranges from beautiful to disturbing,"The good: the grandeur of the ship, getting to see the officers rooms, bridge, decks and promenades. Feeling the sense of history that this great boat has been part of.The bad: as has been mentioned on numerous other reviews, there are four major points that really let this great boat down. Parking at $15 is a disgrace. The lack of tour options - in particular not being able to just tour the boat - is poor. It's confusing to get around. Some simple arrows on the floor or the audio guide actually being numbered concurrently would help. The meld of attraction and hotel has not been pulled off very well. Worst of all though is the disgracefulGhost tour. Regardless of whether you believe in this sort of thing, it is extremely disrespectful to the people who died on board. Ridiculous sound and light effects when simply telling the story of these people would have been far more eerie. And for some reason our tour guide put on a quite bizarre voice whenever she used the microphone which made it sound like she needed the doctor.",OtterChimp
40,Ghost Tour,foune the ghost tour very interesting and was able to see a large amont of the vessel..didnt see nay ghosts ..thence had a few beers at the bar..maybe should have doen this first to see the ghosts.. al in all a pleasent few hours and i would recommend the tour.,whitepele
30,The Queen Mary,"The cost to tour the ship was too much for us, so we just paid to park and walked along the dock. The Queen Mary is enormous, and a spectacular ship to look at.",Scott2919
40,Beautiful Ship,"This is a place that everyone should see at least once! Fun tours, nice shopping, and there are a couple of places to eat too. We ended up staying in the Royal cabin and I must say it was the nicest set of rooms I have ever stayed in on a ship. I wish I always got a room like that on a cruise ship.",fancithatt
40,Great old ship!,"A wonderful school trip with people dancing in formal wear on the hard wood floors in the main room, a television show shooting on deck (Ghost Whisperer), and historic displays everywhere. Very cool trip!",jvolz
40,Great spot for breakfast.,Dress up (if you want to) and take breakfast aboard in the beautiful surroundings of the Queen Mary. A great start to the day in long beach. Highly recommended.,DJames
30,Disappointing as a tourist attraction - maybe OK as a restaurant location,"We visited the Queen Mary hoping to get an insight into a once all-conquering liner and maybe a bit of history. We were disappointed - hardly any of the old ship is open to visitors, the rest seems to be restaurants, hotel, conference and wedding facilities. What there is to see is hard to find - shocking signposting and maps.The Diana exhibition is diverting but even this contains innacuracies (a board about Prince William is inaccurate regarding his Service Career for example) and is faintly creepy (old answerphone messages left by her to be listened to?!). Parking at $15 and not cheap tickets meant we left disappointed and I would not recommend this unless you are also going to take advantage of the restaurants or hotels when it may be a better experience.",familygal_7
10,Tacky tourist trap! - Is it a tacky funplex or historical ship?,Do not and I repeat DO NOT pay full price to enter this trap $24. It is a mixture of history and tackiness rolled together. The audio tour is horrible and all out of order. The signage is non existent. The displays were something I could put together and they had very tacky souvenir shops and old arcade mixed in with the Queen Mary shops. The place really needs new life. I really expected more out of this place. We were ready to leave within 30 minutes. Please believe me when I tell you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,msbianca2
20,Tourist trap-Expensive-History of the boat is cool,"The history of The Queen Mary is really cool. You can feel the ships glory and sadness but getting to that point is an adventure. The parking is expensive at $15 and its very expensive to get on the boat. $24 per person which includes and audio tour. It was very difficult to find your way to begin the audio tour and most of the staff was very rude. Ive lived in Southern California all of my life and I felt really bad for the nice tourist visiting who had to experience the rude employees on the boat. For the price you pay you would expect nice people working there. I felt even worse for the people who were staying at the hotel...it looked nasty. I really enjoyed the history of the boat and learning about its WWII history. The views from the boat are awesome. With your basic ticket you get a free ghost tour...what a joke! This was an awful experience. Not even funny, more disturbing.",Lumerian
20,Should have skipped the Queen Mary!,"I fist visited the Queen Mary in Long Beach as a 12 year old with my parents. I wanted to share the experience with my wife and 9 & 11 year old. The experience was not as good as I had hoped. When we arrived at the ticket counter we were overwhelmed with the ticket package options listed on a board over the ticket office. We pondered it for a few minutes then decided to ask the girl behind the counter her opinion on the best package for a self tour, especially since we were the only ones in line. We were surprised and quite disappointed when she told us all the options were listed on the board as though they were self explanatory. I felt sorry for interrupting her conversation with another attendant who was also behind the counter. We ended up getting advice from another customer who walked up to the counter and seemed to know exactly what they were looking for. The tour itself was confusing and not quite as good as it could have been. We asked another attendant near the engine room for directions and she was rather short with us (need to keep in mind she was reading what must have been a good book before we approached her...sorry to interrupt!). We found our way to the upper portion of the ship where we found interesting sights but still not enough to keep our kids interested. There was a positive experience and that was the Ham Radio operators who are on the upper deck (W6RO). These guys were fantastic. I don't think they were a part of the official Queen Mary staff but they invited us into their radio room and taught us many things about their hobby. Great guys!! Other than that the ship was a bit disappointing. As for the staff of the ship, everyone I spoke with should be released to find jobs they really want!",Michael C
50,Shipwreck!!,"Awesome place to go for Halloween, also very enjoyable for some fine dinning and fine accommodations.",Cesar U
30,how much?,It's magnificent to see...but the day we went...it was crazy expensive and we didn't even go in! I've see it before...we just wanted to go for a drink and app but they wanted like 24.00 to even get ON the boat..we said..no way!! So that didn't happen....maybe if you're from out of town and want to see it...but for just drinks....not paying to just get on the ship...we were NOT the only ones who turned around that day.....,Lori R
50,Definitely go!,"It was so fascinating being on that ship. There is so much history there and it is all so interesting. If you're in LA, the metro will take you straight to Long Beach and don't miss out on the Queen Mary. Plus if you buy the QM tix w/ The Aquarium tix you get a great deal.",JessicaErin11
40,self guide tour,"did the pricess di experience and self guide tour of queenMary plus the ghost experience. the ship is in good condition for 75 years age, but the self guide tour is long to follow and made hard by mid section of ship having to be bypassed on quayside as this the working hotel now",cockerhoop
30,Not the best and not the worst,Watch out because you have to pay fr parking $15.00 and up. Then you can't get on it for free you have to pay and admission fee. The admission to walk around was expensive you are better to take a tour it is cheaper. The ship needs to be repainted. For the 3 of us it was $75 and plus parking. But is was nice walking around. Stores and resturants are over priced. But find a parking spot somewhere else and walk. But it is worth going too.,Sean C
30,A Bit of a waste of time,"Looks great from a distance, but sont get too close or the magic fades. Overpriced food/souvenirs nearby and really quite tacky.",travellinallover
10,Sad,"Having seen one of the most iconic ships of this century from afar it seemed like a sensible idea to have a wander around it and try and relive the splendour of crossing the Atlantic in real style. Well the fun starts with the $15 parking fee then nearly $100 for a family of four. This better be good. We went for the audio tour. The tour directions are a shambles even the staff say start at the top and work down but as you pick up the headset at the bottom it's chaotic, no real idea of where to go and all the things you want to see such as state rooms cabins ect simply are not there, a rather odd sounding audio from central casting becomes annoying and the place is just a run of shabby shops selling poor souvenirs. It neither a museum nor a tour and you wander about getting more lost as there are practically no signs or a route. After being assaulted by the tacky shops and very little else the best part is the bridge and the decks. Even sadder is that even the seats of the life boats have gone and there is a rather sad life boat lowering every so often. The most tragic part is the ghost and legends tour which is worse and less frightening than a bad fairground ride. My 12 year old used the word "" lame ""All in all pay you $15 to park take your pictures and leave as you will be bitterly disappointed after walking round what is left of what was once or could be a magnificent ship. Better still pay $12 take the harbour boat and get some great photos from there. Poor value and all a bit sad.",Mark B
50,Beautiful,"We took the free Passport to the Queen Mary, but was unable to take the tour as they encountered a power failure while we were there, and would not allow visitors to enter the ship. However, we did take several photos of the ship. This is definitely on my bucket list of things to do when I'm again in the area.",luv2win929

30,Interesting but needs more choices in ticketing,"We really enjoy discovering the history of old ships etc, so we were looking forward to visiting the Queen Mary. There are several tours available on the ship. Unfortunately the different tours are sold in packages as part of different tickets. To get the tours you want you may have to purchase a ticket that includes things you don't necessarily want to see. We found this arrangement disappointing.",station

50,An amazing experience,"My sister and I went on a Haunted Passport tour and it was so much fun!! It's an amazing ship, I loved all of the history and looking in places that guests don't get to see.The only thing I didn't like was trying to pull into their parking lot. I think there should be a bigger sign for their parking lot because once you pass the entrance, the road changes into a 'Trucks Only' zone.",EMiLLiE_23
20,Not pleased (not willing) to see visitors,"We had some sort of great expectations, not met.Bad start with unefficient ticket boots: long wait, probably due to the complexity of ticket types which required long explanations.Audio guide free, as advertised. But you need to find the place to get it: on the 4th floor. No signage at all. Many other visitors were asking us where we got ours. Must return to the same place, on 4th floor (although visit terminates on ground floor).Comments very poor. Very limited indications/signage on board. Worst: finding the access to the engine room. There was not even a possibility to see a cabin nor a ballroom. Don't go there: watch the ship from the sea side walk.",matoux00

40,"Fun filled day of history, high tea, and princess Diana","We took 3 tours an all day affair. Great tour guide on the WWII tour so much great information for those of us who want to know of an era before our birth. Knew nothing about the ship being used as a troop transport or to bring War Brides so glad we took this tour. Ghosts and legends tour just okay, but the guide was great as our haunting leader. Do beware: lots of stair climbing very quickly and lots of pitch black areas, if any leg issues be careful. Princess Diana very interesting especially for the women in our group.We realize that High Tea was pricey but so good and more than we could eat. Our server was very good, he did not rush us but keep us on schedule for our next tour.General tour of the ship on our own was quite interesting, like I said an all day adventure",wsenjoyinglife

30,Not really worth it,"If you have kids under 10, this really isn't worth the stop. We got there after 4pm so we did a self-guided tour. Honestly, for the money, we would have done better at the aquarium. It was basically just us walking aimlessly around the ship with our daughter asking the entire time ""can we go to the beach now?""",Dan A
40,Enjoyed the day,"I went to see the Diana exhibit and since I spent about 2 hours in that exhibit alone, I was quite satisfied. It's really not just about Diana, but all the Royals, still I enjoyed it very much. The package I bought included the audio tour of the ship. The info on the audio was interesting, but I didn't find the walking directions very easy to follow, kept getting lost and walking around in circles. Once done with the tape, I didn't find the Queen Mary itself to be all that exciting, sitting on the deck enjoying the beautiful day was nice for a few minutes, but unless you are going to have lunch at one of the restaurants, there isn't much else to do. If you are willing to spend the money, doing a girls day for the Diana exhibit and then tea luncheon in the Queen Mary Tea Room would be a lovely afternoon. I opted to park across the harbor at Shoreline Village and take the free red tourist bus over. This gave me an opportunity to see a little bit more of the area, the Aquarium, Pike shopping and reastaurants area, etc. The buses run frequently and make stops at all the main areas. My parking was the $8 max instead $12-15 it would have been at Queen Mary, I did not eat lunch on the ship so wasn't going to get any validation. Overall it was an enjoyable day and I felt I got my monies worth!",Juliedar67
40,A step back in the past,Aboard a true treasure parked in our back yard. I see her every day driving to the office and enjoy going aboard once in awhile. They do nice events and have had company meetings thee and attended weddings.,jbeyer

50,The Tea Room is pricey but worth it!,"We visited the Queen Mary as a birthday trip for my wife. She wanted to see the Princess Diana exhibit and have tea at the Tea Room.The Tea Room is elegant and situated with a view out of the front of the Queen Mary.The food was excellent: tea, sandwiches and desserts. Service was over-the-top great. I would say that it is on the same level as the Empress Hotel tea in Victoria, B.C.Parking was validated, but is only good for 3 hours. Since our entire visit was 4 hours, we had to pay $15 for parking. However, that did not diminish the enjoyment of the visit.",Tecolate
30,Moderate value for money,"I was keen to visit the ship as she had been built less than 20 minutes drive from where I was raised, though much before my time. The first thing to take note of is the parking charges, anything over an hour was $12 which is more than you pay for a day at Hollywood Blvd.There are a variety of tours to choose from, the cheapest tour is $25pp - this is self guided with a headset to listen to an Irishman (why?) take you round the vessel. You're also given a map with each deck of the ship, hold on to it because it's the easiest way to get around. Other tours include exhibits such as the Diana one on just now and guided tours, these are at least $10 more.I didn't think the headset was necessary for the experience as there is plenty of reading material on board and would advise those on a tighter budget to consider paying the entry fee to use the restaurant ($15) which will be refunded should you go ahead and dine there. Dining is optional so you might save yourself $10, or more if there's a few of you wanting to spend an afternoon here.Be aware that you are required to hand over photo ID to receive your headset (one ID card per group) and this will be returned to you when you take back the headset. The member of staff in charge of this today was not only rude but most unhelpful which was a shame.Inside the ship there are plenty of exhibits, it's had a marvellous history but I worry that it will see out the current 66 year lease. Many sections of the ship are in need of maintenance - the outside could do with some fresh paint and some sections of the inside have been allowed to become neglected - chewing gum on carpets was a disappointment and I really don't think there's any place for a games arcade on it.On the positive side there are many areas of the ship that are immaculate, where you can see the quality of the workmanship and regard it very highly even today all these years later. There was no problem taking photos anywhere and the views of the Harbour were very nice from the ship too. It's worth a visit if you've seen the old cruise liners in movies and you want to see how they used to look in comparison to the newer white ships that travel the world today.There is a fair amount of walking involved - it's a big ship - so this should be taken into consideration. Elevators are available but there are plenty of stairs for those with the enthusiasm to tackle them. In conclusion I'm glad I visited, it's easy to spend an afternoon there, but I felt $25 was a little pricey for what was on offer. Judging by other reviews it seems to be busy on weekends and parking prices may increase further, but there's a free bus to the ship from Downtown Longbeach if you'd rather park there.",invincible_ghost
40,Faded Memories of a bygone era,"We took the self guided tour with an audio tour component. The ship appears in fair to good condition as you explore the various decks. The ship also functions as a hotel with the hotel lobby located in the old first class area of the boat. We were able to explore the engine room of the ship as well as see the captains quarters and anti-aircraft gun deck. While the ship is interesting, we found the price to be high for a self-guided tour without any posted docents to help you navigate such a huge ship. Directions are given on the audio guide, but are not easy to follow. For maximum enjoyment, a docent is needed for this trip. Accompanying us, was a 5 th grader and a high school student who both tired from all the walking from deck to deck and therefore we never stayed for the ghost tour at the end of the day. If you are planning to see the aquarium, you are able to purchase a combination ticket to save you some money.",Sharon B
40,Bygone class,"A fine old lady, although she could do with being painted. The passenger areas were timeless class.We did the audio tour. Quite how they come up with an Irishman to do the commentary is beyond me, Another complaint, common for America, is there are too many references on the timeline and other captions throughout the ship where ""England/English"" is referred to where it should be Britain/British, eg England declared war.The engine room was impressive and it was interesting, for someone who comes from the area she was built, how much equipment was supplied locally. A monument to Scottish engineering.",AlBeKy

50,A Royal Experience,"My family and I stayed on the ship for one night, and it was better than staying in a regular hotel. The room(s) was a First Class State room with a king size bed, with a view overlooking the harbor and downtown Long Beach. Even though you only have portholes to look out through, it was still very nice. The weather was perfect! It was cool and breezy, which was nice to leave our windows open all night. It felt like we were back in time. The bed was comfortable, with clean bedding. The room was also comfortable with a lot of the original fixtures and fittings. The wood throughout the room, made it cozy and homely. It also had a nice, long walkway from the door, to the bed, that had a cute, little vanity halfway through. I wondered what it was like to be on the ship in the '30s whilst it was sailing and to be sitting at the vanity, grooming yourself, or, to be sitting at the desk, which was just off the bathroom, towards the door, to sit there and write a letter to the folks back home. We explored the whole ship, walking up and down. At night, we drove to downtown Long Beach, and admired the ship from the other side of the harbor with all the lights shining through the sky. We picked up dinner from Denny's, and took it back to the Queen Mary, and ate on the deck overlooking downtown. The weather was cool, with a nice breeze that made it feel as though we were sailing. We had the whole ship to ourselves as we went on a weekday, which was perfect! We roamed around some more after dinner, then retired to our room. We will definitely have to stay more than one night next time we are in the area. What a lovely experience this was. One we will remember always. P.S, we took the self guided tour, while our teenagers took the ghost tour, and I have to say, the propeller was the creepiest thing ever!",mellrb702

40,Lots of History,"For those of us who have had a family member in WWII that travelled to Europe on this ship, it is an amazing and emotional experience. My father took this ship from New York to Glasgow, Scotland in 1942 and to see the ship with all the stories inm mind about the boat being inches from capsizing, the number of men who were sardines on the ship during travel and the accommodations for black soldiers (which is not portrayed on the boat and is the only disappointment) is pretty awe inspiring. I didn't take the ghost tour, but to learn about the ship's history on my own was still a pleasurable experience. It is worth it!",Tiffanydb
40,"Excellent self-guided tour, delicious food, but too crowded on the Fourth of July!","The Queen Mary is a beautiful and elegant ship, but the Fourth of July crowd brought many challenges. First of all, the parking rate was raised from $5.00 to $15.00 just for the holiday. Second, we had bought a self-guided audio tour, but were told that since they only own three hundred head sets and there were thousands of guests, no one would be using them. We also had purchased two seats to view the scheduled Fireworks show. No added seats were set up because we were told, last year, rowdy patrons had thrown the chairs overboard as a part of the revelry. So instead, we found a spot on the floor of the rear deck and sat on a poncho I had brought for warmth. The restaurants were overbooked, but we were not allowed to leave the ship and return after 3:00 p.m. Therefore, those of us lucky enough to make the cut, waited three hours to be seated. The bathroom facilities are nicely appointed and well equipped, but long lines formed, inconveniencing many. Additional signage would have helped to find bathrooms on other decks.Even with all of the obstacles we encountered, it was an enjoyable day on The Queen Mary. For a much more pleasant experience, I would recommend going during the week, or at the very least, avoiding holidays.",Lorraine M

30,Diana not worth price,"Bought ticket including Queen Mary and Princess Diana. The Diana exhibit including some of her dresses and some of Kate's but the remainder was commemorative plates, dinner menus, a few letters and other auction purchased items. Nothing new or spectacular. The impression we left with is that someone put together an exhibition of their private collection in an effort to recoup some of the expense. Enjoyed the Queen Mary tour although they are really remodeling the tour and finding all the audio stops can be tricky (negotiating the elevators, stairs, etc). unfortunately, pool was closed...propeller was ghostly...only had coffee in the to go cafe...tables on the promenade are worn out but coffee was fine.

We even managed to get spots on the Paranormal Ghost walk which was quite enlightening. We got to see many parts of the ship that are not open to the public unsupervised. We learnt so much about the history of the ship. It was incredible to see some of the original furnishings and the Art deco bar was a highlight, with the art work being original. The staff onboard are attentive, helpful and knowledgable. I would definitely visit again.",jojo82

20,Very disappointing experience,"Went as part of a convention group and had difficulties almost immediately. Everyone was quite excited about this tour but as we approached the ticket counter (and found only one window open), our group was met with an unresponsive staff. We were told prior to our arrival that anyone who wanted to join us, but had not purchased their ticket in advance, could simply buy a ticket there. Unfortunately we had to call a manager (and then the sales manager who had arranged the group ticket sales) to try to determine which tours had been pre-purchased so that we could match that with the new attendees. No one had any idea as to how to handle this and chaos ensued. We were told by the first manager that they could not accomodate any more than the original group and he seemed very put-out by the additional customers (we numbered about 25). Don't know many businesses which would actually turn away paying customers but it seemed, incredibly, that was what he wanted to do. When we finally got everyone ticketed (they still did not open another window although he said they were going to), we had wasted almost an hour of our touring time. There is very insufficient signage so we spent another 10 minutes or so trying to find the entrance to the ship. No one was around to ask and there was garbage (soda cans, beer bottles etc) and debris all over the entire walkway area around the entrance to the ship. I think there was some sort of ""festival"" the day/night before and the partiers had trashed the entire area. Although is was 2 pm , this garbage had still not been cleaned up. Big trip and fall liability issue in my opinion. Also, it appeared that they are doing some heavy remodeling.. Construction equipment and debris also littered the entire outside area. Quite appalling for an attraction of this caliber. We finally arrived on board the ship and all seemed well until we encountered more construction/remodeling equipment on the decks. Our guided tour was OK but quite over-the-top and we lost some people along the way. As we were getting ready to do the Ghost Tour, we were told that our ticket did not include that tour (the sales manager who arranged the group tickets had specifically told us that tour WAS included). The tickets were not accepted by the ""scanner"" and therefore we were denied entry to that tour!! By that time, everyone was tired of arguing and we just simply left. Very upsetting and disappointing for such a historical place. They really need to get their act together.",tripsahoy16

10,Horrible!,"It took over 30 minutes just to get a ticket because ""their computer system was acting up"". They did not honor military nor AAA discount that they advertise! We had a baby in a stroller and they do not tell you that it is not handicap nor stroller friendly, the stairs are narrow and steep and very few elevators, if you can find them. The haunted tour was horrible and stupid. They start you at one area and drop you off in another and leave and then we could not find our way back and no one around to ask to get the stroller. Waste of time and money, and like my boyfriend said ""Why would you pay to go on a boat that doesn't move?"" Half the stores were closed with no times posted of store hours.",Hunyb D

The only warning I would give is don't go on for the unescorted tour after 4.00 pm because you will not be issued with headphones and you may, like me, get lost. Sadly the ticket office will still take your money without telling you this.",ericBournemouth

30,Buy the $15 Restaurant Voucher ticket,"We just wandered down to the Queen from the Maya hotel. The best deal was the $15 restaurant voucher ticket. It lets you wonder the upper decks on your own. Then you can stop in a restaurant or bar on board and have dinner or drinks and pay for it with the voucher. It was fairly empty the day we were there accept for the ghosts. The decks and hallways were often empty. Some of the areas are nicely restored. Others, like the starboard side promenade were worn, in disrepair and full of flies. We had drinks and snacks in the Art Deco Lounge. It is tired, but you can see it's former glory in the faded room. We wondered down to the hotel two decks below to see what it looked like. It appeared to be in better shape and equally full of ghosts. Buying the voucher ticket made it totally worth it.",Chris K

It ended up being anything but a postive experience for us. We waited 30 minutes in line just for a ticket, was treated very rudely by the ticketing staff, and should have taken that all as a sign of things to come. The ship is a wreck... nothing like I remembered. Very disappointing day. You want to visit an historical ship? My recommendation, spend your time and money to make the trip to San Diego and enjoy your day touring the Midway Aircraft carrier.",Juliertravels

We got there from the Long Beach main street, on the local free bus, which was convenient, but it takes a convoluted route - it takes 25 mins, not the 10 mins you think it will take. When we got there I saw that parking looked plentiful and easy.",Beriden
40,Worth the gruelling bus/train ride,"If you can handle the awful public transport in this city, The Queen Mary is worth the effort. The whole ship is decked out in classic Art Deco style. The ship has a rich history and is quite facinating.The tours are a bit confusing in the way they are set out. There are different ones and I'm still not sure if I did all the ones I was entitled to on my ticket. People were constantly asking crew memebers if they were in the right spot for a certain tour.I found the tours not very in depth, (He didn't show us very much and kept going on about where the wood was from.) and found much more satisfaction in going around the ship by myself.Watch out for the Ghosts and ledgends tour, It's not really a tour. It's basically a haunted mansion type walkthrough, with special effects and stuff. This was disapointing as I just wanted to see the ship and learn about the ghosts.People (Seemed to be the americans) really liked my tour guide and found him hillarious for the way he drew out sentences and said things with odd inflection, but I just found it really irritating.",AbellaRose

50,Totally Majestic... Quaintly Mysterious,"If you take the time to visit the ""Queen"" during ""off"" hours you have a very unique chance to do something very special... and I tell you this, as a former employee of the Queen Mary. I was there - waaay back when when the Queen Mary was first berthed in Long Beach - and the City Council, had no idea how much trouble they were in for - or how long it would be to re-furbish the Queen and how much money it would take to do so... The Mayor and the City Council members who made the historic and (at the time) batty decision to purchase and invest in this HUGE Titanic-ish ship were all voted out of their jobs in the very next election - but alas... you can't get rid of a monstrosity this big... once you have it...As a side note... The City of Long Beach also purchased Howard Hughes ""Spruce Goose"" http://goo.gl/KKdKq and berthed *this* attraction across the parking lot from the Queen and it turned out to be a financial ""black hole"" and they had no buyers for it, and no Money to keep the attraction open... so they towed it out to sea and scuttled it... even the National Museum of Air & Space didn't want it... it was too BIG!Back to the Queen... I don't care about the onboard Hotel... it may be fine... I loved working for the 'Lord Nelson' restaurant way back when (I'm sure it's not open anymore) andI don't care about any of the other restaurants... *they may be fine*... the actual attraction is the Queen itself... and the reason I'm recommending you visit during OFF Hours is so you can amble past the ropes that say ""off limits"" and open the doors that say ""Employees only"" and wind your way down into the bowels of the ship... into the areas where the public *doesn't go*... there is nothing dangerous... trust me.... there is no fresh paint just lots of creepy rust and darkness (bring a flashlight) - there are plenty of gangways and paths and single-file weirdnesses that you will never, ever forget... pick your way towards the back where the propellers are... and down where the Engines belong... if you hear somebody... turn off your flashlight and freeze... if somebody sees you... just play dumb... all they will do is escort you back up to where the ""Public"" belongs - and if you've got any gumption, you'll wait 5-minutes and go right back down there... the worst that will happen is they'll ask you to leave... just make sure you've already bought you're flippin' postcards, and had lunch... you've done the magic! There is nothing like this in the whole US!",Jbrephan
40,Elegant and impressive.,"I visited the Quern Mary as my grandfather was on it as a soldier in WWII. We started off in the boiler room which was amazing and then traipsed through some badly displayed areas of the ship. These need some attention!! We then moved on to the public areas of the ship - gorgeous bars, formal rooms and walkways. We ran out of time and I regretted spending so much time in the grimmer parts - so take a tip and ''do' the public bits first. Also if you pick up the free shuttle bus from near the aquarium make sure the bus is going straight to the ship or you'll have a 40 min trip round Long Beach!!! Bit frustrating!",Bonestone
30,Great ship below average staff,"My family and I stayed early April2012 The ship is fantastic, the cabins, restaurants, baths, veneers etc. are still in great condition, the whole art deco look and feel were a real hit with us all just a shame that the reception staff do not match up. We had booked 1 double and 1 twin, the rooms were not available until 4.30!! and then we were given 2 doubles. The receptionist told me I had booked 2 doubles even though the booking showed 1 twin and 1 double. This attitude summed up the reception staff for me, they were arrogant and superior in their dealings with people. Also my booking stated a fridge and tea/coffee would be in the room, they were not and when asked reception staff said- 'we don't provide those any more'. I would stay again but the experience would be better if the staff lost the chip on the shoulder and lived up to the standard the ship herself has maintained over the years",JONNNOO

Fot $50 for the two of us, I wish the ""Behind the Scenes"" tour were part of it. From the looks of the hotel, it looks like a fun place to stay. We walked around a lot of it to see if it would be worth staying in some time. Expect to spend about 4 hours touring the boat, even self-guided, especially if you like to take photos. There are great views of Long Beach from the boat. We did not eat on the boat because it all looked way too expensive.",mikki777

40,Plan ahead and pick the best tour options,"When you arrive at the ticket booth for the Queen Mary and Russian submarine tours you will have many tour options to choose from. We were there during the late morning so we chose the submarine tour, the Queen Mary basic tour, and then had the option of the ghost tour or WWII tour. We chose the ghost tour. The basic history tour with a look in to the first class dining, smoking room, and pool is fabulous. We were lucky to find one of the suites unoccupied and got to see an interior cabin. Great history and ample time for photographs. The ghost tour is a bit more gimmicky than I cared for and should have went on the paranormal tour that takes you to specific haunted locations. The ghost tour is more of a haunted house attraction. You don't have to spend a fortune if you plan ahead and read up on tour information on the web site.Tip: We didn't have time for sit down meal at the cafe. In front of the cafe is a bakery stand with drinks and snacks. If you are in a hurry the pastries and cookies are good and there is a sit down area. I bought bottled water to carry on the tour.",Oldhalloween
30,Faded but still elegant reminder of early 20th century transatlantic travel,"Restoration continues as the Queen Mary host's overnight guests, conventions, meetings, and various special events. Self-guided tours are best enjoyed with a recorded audio program. Expect to spend several hours in order to enjoy all of the many locations open to tour participants (from the engine room to the bridge). Special guided events include ""ghost"" tours, as scheduled. Older visitors will appreciate letters posted in several tour passageways that offer the Queen's story transporting American servicemen and women to Britain during WWII. Equally poignant are letters from English war brides reflecting their journey to New York at the end of the War.Launched in 1939, the RMS Queen Mary remained in service until 1967. This ship is among the last of the great steamships transporting celebrities, immigrants, and mail between Europe and America. Too expensive to transition to the kind of “cruise” travel popular today, the Queen was also victim to competition of transatlantic travel by air. Although a generation younger than the RMS Titanic and its sister ship, the Queen is a more convenient opportunity to see and understand the elegance of this era (1900-1967.The City of Long Beach as well as the preservationist community in Southern California should make polishing this faded gem a priority.

Some parts of it were closed as there was a private function going on, which is a bit unfair as you pay to see all of it. She needs to be looked after and is looking quite shabby in places, doesn't look like any money is being spent to keep her in tip top condition. Worth seeing but not as good as it could be.",Audrey P
30,Queen Mary Attraction,Last Sept we visited the Queen Mary and went on one of the tours. I've lived in Southern California all my life and have never been to the attraction. I was very impressed with the tour we went on and the knowledge the staff shared. We than walked around the ship and had lunch on board. Prices were some what expensive but it is Calif. I will go back for one of their other tours soon.,"Mark in Palm Springs, Ca"
50,Awesome!,We stayed in the Queen Mary Hotel. I was saddened to find no ghosts. We stayed for our anniversay and at at their award winning Sir Winston's restaurant. Very nice presentation.,JAMROX69CA
50,Queen Mary is a ship high in world heritage and history; well worth a visit..,"Royal Mail Ship Queen Mary is tied up for good at Long Beach, California, and is converted into a hotel and visitor attraction. Although changed by conversion and now lacking some engines, the greater part of the ship is there and gives a full experience of what it was like to travel in the modern 'airliner' of the day. The QM was just about the only way to cross the Atlantic Ocean and did it in about four days each way. The ship is very elegant and in an Art Deco style outside and in. There are great photo opportunities everywhere, including the bridge, the engine room, the various grand salons and corridors. You can have a nice lunch, go on an escorted and informative tour or simply wander about at your own pace. For maritime hertitage lovers, this is a must, since so few of the contemporary liners exist intact. This is worth a half-day visit. You'll need good shoes and outdoor wear for the exterior and take your camera.",Lungipiedi
50,As close to actually being on the Titanic as you probably will ever be!,"If you have never been aboard an old ship from the the Titanic's era, The Queen Mary is is the ship to for you to explore and/or tour. You can even go down into her very lower deck cabins, the steerage passenger areas, and into her very bowells, where the boilers and engines are house, and imagine what it was like to have been a stoker or a steerage passenger aboard a ship like this. It can even be a somewhat spooky experience if you let your imagination run wild! Try her! You'll love her!",amercorp
40,Nostalgia,"We didn't stay here - only walked through with a friend who was staying. Her room was tiny, Be sure to ask about room size when booking. Otherwise, really large, old fashioned promenade decks, many levels of viewing. Nice bar/resturaunt, outside seating is ok. Watch out for the horn.",Utahns_
30,Almost Empty Shell,"We arrived not aware that almost everything in this ship was stripped out by a previous owner in order to keep it ""afloat"". Everything costs ! When you drive in you have to park and pay before you commit to a tour minimum $25USD per person. Credit card wasnt available at the time, so add the 6.00 ATM fee plus as an overseas visitor another international ATM fee. Yeah it was historic, but nothing to rave about sadly.",gidget_8

Excellent view of the Long Beach skyline too.",LVI56

40,Grand Old Lady,"Be aware that the cost to park and two senior tickets was $57. We took the Ghost tour and it was indeed spooky down to the bottom of the ship with many terrifying tales practically in the dark...need I say more? I was stuck tight to my hubby.The museum part is very interesting. We went aboard to eat lunch...also expensive. Now if you don't eat lunch and go through the first entrance, you will not be able to see the whole ship. As it was, we got our money's worth. Having been aboard the Royal Carribbean ship, there is nothing of the former grandeur pictured in the movie Titanic. Most of the dining and open areas are now for wedding receptions. We did not spend the night and there were no open staterooms to look in that could give us a clue as to the accommodations. We spent about 3 hours roaming the ship including our lunch.",Flyinggal
40,worth the price,"I just came back from RMS Queen Mary. It's not a cheap attraction but worth the price. Parking alone is $12, Self guided tour (audio) is about $21 but you have to get First Class passage tour. It costs $33 but includes self guided tour, tour of russian submarine and Behind the Scenes tour. That last tour was my absolutely favorite, the guide Paul was great and full of really cool stories about the ship. As to self guided tour, it was OK if you don't like staying in the group and want to do it at your own pace. I kept however getting lost on ship and it took me a long time to find my way around. Behind the scenes tour takes you to places you wouldn't normally see. The only disappointment was we weren't able to see any cabins, or hotel rooms. It would be nice to see the hotel rooms since I've been planning for a long time to stay on the ship as a guest. Views of Long Beach from the ship were great but the stories from the past were my favorite. it is a place you should see once in your lifetime especially if' you've been interested in big ships like Titanic, Queen Elizabeth 2 etc.",M_GO_BLUE_A2

Two portal windows gave us a beautiful view of the Long Beach skyline under a full moon.",janesig
50,A trip back in time.,"She's a classic and beautiful ship, LOTS of beautiful wood and art/deco features. The rooms might be a little smaller than expected, but it is a 80 year old ship, after all. It still was worth the stay just to wander around the beautiful, old lady.",BigDRB
30,interesting but overprice,"Bought a combo Queen Mary/Aquarium of the Pacific so I got a little bit of a discount. The ghost tour in the front of the ship was a tourist trap but included in the price of admission. There's a museum in the back that was more interesting. You get to see the propeller (in the water), engine room, etc. The hotel part of the ship is just open for you to wander around as much as you like. Go to the top deck to get the old-world feel of the ship. Their self-guided tour order is a bit convoluted: ghost tour up front, museum in the back, then hotel middle. Just do the museum first (pick up audio equipment there), then hotel, then ghost tour if you feel like it.Be forewarn, the ticket price is expensive and the parking is even more so.",48Traveling
20,Queen Mary in desperate need of makeover and structure!,"I visited the Queen Mary on Monday Feb 27th 2012.I bought the combo ticket for the Aquarium of the Pacific for $36 which included a visit to the Queen Mary.First and foremost the parking...once you arrive there are no signs indicating where the entrance is for the Queen Mary. Got a tad lost, eventually found the hotel entrance of the Queen Mary and the employee there told me you had to go up these stairs on the left, then over a bridge, then down stairs to the entrance.It was quite the walk! Arriving at the entrance I was annoyed and frustrated to find out that we were supposed to take our ""vouchers"" we got at the Aquarium back to the parking lot to exchanged them at a booth for tickets to enter. The Aquarium never specified this and there were no signs telling you this.After the long walk back I was ready to just get a refund! Unfortunately the Queen Mary does not refund tickets, at all. Fun, fun.Of course if they had a sign saying you could walk the ways through the parking lot instead of up stairs over a bridge then down stairs this would be useful. Granted you cross into a ""construction"" zone towards the entrance but saves you all the stairs!If you would like a self-guided audio tour you can exchange your ID for a tape cassette and earphones. I opted out.Once inside everything everything is poorly lit. It's hard to read signs and there was very little to actually see. Some of the history is pretty interesting but there is a lot of nothing, little signs, and poor structure here. You can seriously get lost.In fact...after going back towards the hotel, up stairs, down stairs, in an elevator...we made it to the top of the ship and nearly got LOCKED INSIDE. On our map there is an area that is marked ""Crews Quarters"" and there is a sign indicating this. There are double doors that led inside a dark area with stairs. Before the door closed behind me I had my Father stand outside it in case for some reason it locked. IT DID.We could have easily gotten locked inside this ""exhibit"" and there were no signs saying it was closed and it was marked on the map. BIZARRE!I also visited the bar at the top of the Queen Mary and sat down. There was a bartender who ignored our existence and a waitress who avoided us. We never got service. After waiting for ten minutes we just left and decided to get drinks elsewhere away from the Queen Mary.To top off this terribly disappointing and odd experience the Queen Mary charged us $14 to park for two hours.Needless to say the Queen Mary is very majestic from far away and I am sure rich in history. Unfortunately whoever is running the Mary right now is doing an incredibly poor job. The elevator was also covered in blankets inside, I have no idea why.I will not be returning and will definitely cross this off of ""things to do"" in Southern California.",adormouse

Firstly our tour guide - I think his name was Joe or John - was amazing! He could tell you anything about this beautiful ship that you might like to know and had a ton of stories to tell. What blew me away though was the glamour and elegance of the place - especially the big ball room - you could really imagine the Clarke Gable, Fred Astaire's and Tony Curtis's wandering around the place. You also got to see the workings of the ship and rooms kept as they were in those days.

40,A wonderful thing to see..,"It was great to visit this wonderful old ship which has been turned into a hotel and tourist attraction. It's history made it worthwhile as my father was one of the servicemen who sailed in her in 1943. Having said all that, I thought it was a tad expensive just to go inside, even to have a drink in the bar on the Promenade deck. The bar was nice though, very art deco. The only other thing, not the Queen Mary's fault, is getting there. If you have a car, that's okay, but we use public transport a lot and it was a very long journey from our hotel in Hollywood to Long Beach, over two hours! But it was still a nice visit.",Judy W

40,Way too expensive,This attraction is a glimpse into the past and the beauty of yesteryear. Stunningly beautiful and historically interesting we loved it. BUT she is in trouble. They are losing money so they have driven the prices up too high and this is off putting. What really got us hot under the collar was being charged $12 parking when the ship alone cost over $50. Such a shame when history is sitting in the harbour and so accessible that it is out of the reach financially to so many people.,Willowray

30,The Queen Mary. Half a century of going nowhere fast.,If you would like to tour this venerable old cruise ship you will find it alluring. It a cruise ship for an era when only the elite had access to a trans Atantic trip on a luxurious floating hotel. By today's standards the hotel is not so luxurious. Never the less you may find the rooms and public areas worth the effort. This is located somewhat off the beaten track in Long Beach. There is not much going on in Long Beach. This attraction would not be high on my bucket list.,Stephen P
30,"Go at night, tell ghost stories.","As much as I wanted to be wowed by the Queen Mary, I have to say that the only thing impressive about it is its size... when you're standing right next to it. Once inside (I was there for a Christmas event a while back), it really shows its age. And perhaps I'm a Philistine for not appreciating its history, but I was looking for more if it was to be called an attraction. I will say there is one beautiful thing about the ship--the fact that it can be so scary in the dark. So if you go, go at night--and tell ghost stories.",Nathan S

I was about to persuade the family to cut our losses and go when the kids reminded me we had the Ghost Tour as part of our ticket package. This guided tour was worth the price of entry for us!

30,Interesting,"I has some free time in So. Cal., so I decided to check out the Queen Mary. Parking is $12 and entrance is $24.50 so it's not exactly cheap. The tour starts with a ghost tour of several parts of the ship that are supposed to be haunted, including the boiler room. This is a little (well, alot) hokey since the guide makes attempts to scare guests and the tours is accompanied by a variety of sound effects that are supposed to be ghosts. The stories, however, were interesting. I would have preferred to hear the history without the ""show."" The remainder of the tour is self guided and includes the outside decks, the promenade, and engine rooms. Most of the ship is a hotel so rooms are not accessible. As a fan of cruises, I enjoyed the history of this old ship.",hbhakh
50,"Very impressive; Great Ghost Tour, Haunted Swimming Pool; Stay for 3-4 hours","I've visited this twice while on business. Impressive ship, excellent woodwork and etched glass throughout the ship. Lots of brass & lifeboats & bells but the Ghost tour well below decks was best because everything left orginal. Also, they simulated some 'flooding'. Plus I swear I saw a old magazine behind some glass fluttering like someone was flipping pages. There was no fan inside the exhibit either. The haunted, old 1st class swimming pool below deck was just incredible.Engine room was huge with lots of brass wheels. Good snack bars along with a real bar towards the bow. Nice photo opportunities. I didn't stay overnight but very good hotel lobby with great woodwork and molding. You can pretty much walk everywhere.You don't have to kill all day here; this isn't Disneyland or DisneyWorld. Two hours isn't enough but I'd say 3 or 4 hours would do this ship justice.

There was no way we could have stayed ""entertained"" to wait for that presentation!! We left at noon, disappointed!!!

It said not for children under 13 unless with parent. If your kids get very easily spooked then don't take them, but otherwise, it kind of reminds me of a Disney ride. Except walking. We went on a tour with a guide, and it was entertaining I suppose. But not worth the large sum of $$ we paid pp. The history we learned was cool, but otherwise don't waste your $$.",h2o_mermaid

20,"Walk on the Boat, Not the Tour","Myself and my boyfriend come from Scotland and know a good ghost tour when we see one. This was not one of them.We purchased the General Admission tickets (the cheapest ticket) for $25 each which included a Ghost tour and a self guided walk around the ship. We did the 4pm tour. The tour guide for the ghost tour seemed bored and fed up. I could not understand one word of what he said. He quickly muttered information as if he had said the same old script a hundred times over every day for a very long time. I am unsure whether he was trying to come across as creepy, but that certainly wasn't the impression that I got.The tour itself allows you to see the swimming pool and go below deck, this in itself is very impressive and interesting, however, it's very hard to take it in and appreciate what you are seeing as your eyes are bombarded with special effects lighting and your ears are deafened with loud noise. I was dissappointed as they have turned a genuinely haunted attraction into a Disney like Haunted Mansion. It lasted appr. 30 minutes altogether.A lot of the ship is off limits to tourists and there are a lack of sign posts directing tourists where to start their self guided tour, unless you have been aboard the Red October and can navigate the map you are given upon admission. All you are told is 'go down to the end' and 'We can't book the ghost tour here you have to go up there and do it'.Later, after the 'Ghost Tour' we saw the hotel entrance half way down and thought to ask a member of staff where the self guided tour started, they ignored us the first time they saw us as they seemed more interested in socialising with their colleagues, then when they did acknowledge us they misdirected three times!I discovered it is actually FREE to walk into the hotel - well, not once were we asked to show our tickets. From here, you can navigate to most places of interest eg. The Promenade Deck, Queen's Salon.We did, however, like the Victorian clothing worn by all the passengers, that gave the boat a genuine feel as to what a typical day upon the Queen Mary would have have looked like many years ago, this was due to a company function that evening.Tip: Don't buy a ticket, take the elevator up to the 4th floor via the hotel entrance and you will see the main attractions upon the Queen Mary. To park your car is $3 for one hour OR $12 for the day!",PaulaMc

10,Great Boat - But The Actual Exhibits Are Appalling,"We spent around $65 for the exhibition part of the ship, which I think is cleverly designed to make you think this is the actual part to see. It's not. We felt conned. Even more so after having already paid to park the car. The staff on the way in were unattentive, too busy chatting to colleagues and clueless as to where we should go.What we got for our money was an outstandingly terrible ""exhibition"" (which I describe in the loosest sense possible). Vast areas of not much going on. Old, tatty exhibits with often no description of what you're supposed to be looking at. Unless looking at bolts on mothballed engines gets you going, you must heed my warning and avoid this at all costs.The cheaper - and recommended option - is to take the lift at the hotel entrance and head up to the third floor. There we were able to walk around, see REAL interesting stuff, such as the impressive views from the stern and helm, and finish off our few hours with a couple of cocktails in the impressive Observation Bar. It was quite moving to have the very same cocktails that Laurel & Hardy and Cary Grant sipped in the very same spot., albeit we weren't going anywhere.We got some great gifts from the souvenir shops (some of the best of our whole trip) and the snack bar was alright.Wasn't challenged once for a ticket in this area at all. So we were left wondering whether that was by accident or by design.Either way, don't pay an admission to see the pointless and poor ""exhibition"" part of the ship unless you're an absolute fanatic. General holidaymakers and Art Deco fans don't need to pay any extra.",CockneyBrum

40,"Grand Old Lady, Fading","I remember the Queen Mary on one of her final voyages. While the hull is the same, the spirit of the ship has long ago departed. She stands as a monument to an era of style and sophistication that is ultimately lost on 99% of those who visit. For those who knew her in life, it is sad to see they fading paint and miss the vibration from the engines below. Better though than the alternative.In fairness, the exhibits are generally informative, the ship is, for the most part, well-maintained and the guides fairly well-informed. It is well worth the price of admission.",VMBinExile
30,Go see the Propeller Room,"This place is also great for upscale parties, weddings and receptions. The propeller room is structure built outside the ship that allows visitors to actually see what a gigantic ship's propeller looked like in the 1930's. It's quite overwhelming and not for the faint of heart.",UnionSparky
40,Old charm,"Attended a few formal events on this ship. Kept in pretty good condition. The eery old feel contributes to the atmosphere of this ship. I wouldn't have my wedding on this ship, but a Halloween party...heck yes!",loriv247
40,A Night With the Queen,"In the past I attended a couple functions on the ship and had the option to stay the night, but choose not to. Recently I decided to stay the night and check the ship out a bit more. I ended up in a state room down the hall from Registration. This turned out to be a good location because I could exit the ship quickly and it was two levels from the Promenade deck.The state room was surprisingly roomy. As large as or larger than what I am used to on a cruise ship, mostly because the room is long from the door to the port holes, of which there were two. There was a full closet and several small drawers. The room was mostly original with the addition of central air, phone and TV. It’s nostalgic because the old heating system and even a fan mount are still present. The same is true of the bathroom. Old knobs for sea water are still present. Note on the bathroom. If you have a hanging doc kit, you will do well. There is little counter space.The room itself is done in some of the 54 kinds of wood used in the ship. Lighting was adequate. There is a between space for beverages, etc. Note, there is no frig, but ice buckets are provided. In all the room was comfortable. The main possible drawback is that the walls are thin. It was not disturbing, but very noticeable. I simply adjusted which bed I slept on to where the noise was and I was fine.I also took one of the daytime tours, the Behind the Scenes Tour. It was one hour and somewhat fascinating. James led the tour and he was entertaining as well. Some time I will return for the self-guided tour because it covers some different areas. I was able to stand in front of a stage that Bob Hope played on, while standing on a dance floor that Fred Astaire danced on. That was great by itself.If you like nostalgia, this is fun for a night or two. Beside the tours, there is not a great deal to do on the boat. There is a spa and a couple restaurants and one bar. If you happen to have an event on the ship that would be the perfect time to stay I think.A bonus is that you are at the end of the line for the Passport bus system. This is a free shuttle bus that the city of Long Beach offers that will take you to the mainland and the Shoreline Village, The Pike at rainbow Harbor, Aquarium of the Pacific and Pine Street. All these are accessible from the free shuttle. If you have an extra day, Belmont Shore and Naples are only a couple miles to the South.",Indi237
40,Great Art Deco,This ship has fantastic art deco desing elements. Cocktalis and walking around in the evening are just about the perfect amount of tiem / money spent here.,da b
50,Nice for one night,"This is something I have always wanted to do. I was in town by myself and decided to stay a night. When I checked in the fellow instantly upgraded me to an outside room. THAT was very nice of him. The staff was great the room was vintage and great. Lots of history there. They let me check in early and I went into tourist mode. I walked all around the ship a found it to be quite interesting. Food and drinks were also good, but I felt like I was trapped at that location. From looking at it you would think there are places to visit but they are way to far to walk and when I get a bunch a beer in me, Id rather walk. Overall very good ..OOOOOO except , I had to pay for internet. . I hate that. Little pet peeve of mine.",silencedogoodYork

40,"Great experience, great ""ghost and legend""show",Had a great time. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Got to attend the show along with a tour of the ship... Didn't experience any paranormal activities but other claim that they did.,sarsoora
40,A great way to spend an afternoon,"We came to Long Beach by Metro train from Hollywood and got the free shuttle bus to the ship. We spent the afternoon wandering around this beautiful old ship which is steeped in history. We didn't follow a particular tour so we explored the ship at our own pace and looked at the exhibitions and went down to the engine room. The propeller was really eerie - don't miss this on your visit! We got a bit lost at times but this meant we saw other parts of the ship - such as the hotel part - that we might not have seen otherwise.We had a drink in the Observation Bar, which was very Art Deco. It really feels like you've stepped back in time on this ship.I would recommend this attraction if you're in the Long Beach area.",LittleG2010
50,Sunday Brunch and tour on the Queen Mary,"On December 11,2011 I was invited to a holiday celebration at the Queen Mary. I hadn't been there in several years. First, we had the Sunday Brunch in the Grand Salon, it was excellent from the food to the service to the room itself. Afterwards we took the World War II ship tour, our guide brought history to life for all of us. Bring a camera, shoes you can walk in (if taking one of the tours), if you are doing the Sunday Brunch the dress is dressy casual, and let your imagination take over and bring you back to a time when elegance was alive and well. It was a wonderful day and experience that was made for a specail occasion.",BunB
40,If you can stay on board for the night,"This is my second visit to the Queen Mary this time around I decide to stay for the night and experience the ship as a guest. To give you an overall picture I arrived at Long Beach Airport during renovation but it was not an issue, shuttles,buses, taxis and rentals are ready for your choosing taxi cab is about $45 to the Queen Mary or take the bus for $1.25. I opted the bus since there was no hurry to get there. The bus service was great but do your research so you know where to get off and get the free shuttle (C shuttle) to the Queen Mary, bus ride was about 55 minutes, clean and safe. Once on premises take the elevator to the 3rd floor ""A"" deck check in and get to your room.For Touring info the desk will send you to the 4th floor (Promenade deck) where you can buy discounted tour tickets as a guest of the ship. Now about the tours be prepared to walk up and down stairs; I opted for the Ghost and legends, Haunted Encounter and the Scorpion Sub. I think they are a must do as the first two will take you to different part of the ship. Like others had said the Ghost and legend tour is very loud at the pool with very cheesy special effects they could do better and I hope they do in the future, one special treat you get to stand four feet from the bottom of the sea and get to see the very front of the ship from the inside where the QM collided with the destroyer. The Highlight of the Haunted tour is to be able to see the only propeller left still mounted on the ship. Now if you think the ship is big from the outside wait until you get to see the inside where the boilers used to be at the space is HUGE. Another must do is the Russian Sub be warned going from bulk to bulk is a little odd and required you to bend and squeeze yourself on a round opening about the size of a barrel once thru the opening there is plenty space as not to feel claustrophobic as a tip make sure you take a peek at the periscope as I almost miss it you can actually move it around!. The exterior souvenir is a little expensive but you can always find something to take one on the affordable side. Now inside the ship there are plenty of little stores to find something as a souvenir and there are plenty of places to eat for something fancy try The Winston Churchill, for the sport bar beer and snack try the Observation deck and for the pizza and sandwich type try the Hollywood deli my favorite!.There are plenty of areas to see and walk around I specially enjoyed walking at night and rarely finding anyone I had the whole ship to myself! but then again it was a Tuesday night! so for a more intimate experience try the weekday stay. On the night of my stay one couple try to imitated one of the scenes from the movie the Titanic and the girl fell to her dead so please don't do that people that jump trying to rescue the girl got hypothermia after a few minutes on the water. This ship has plenty of History and plenty of on board deaths. Oh the ship horns are operational and believe me they are loud. So tour and stay on this fabulous ship the staff was great just remember the steel between the rooms do transmit sound so be kind and don't be loud.",gian99Ca
40,Ghosts and Legends Tour Was Great!,"We purchased the Self Guided Queen Mary tour that came along with the Ghosts and Legends tour. I could have done without the self guided tour. We didn't have the audio so perhaps that would have made a difference. Other than the sun deck and the promenade, there really wasn't much else to see on the ship. We loved the Ghosts and Legends tour, the tour guide was great and I loved the attraction. Although everything was ""staged"" I felt they put on a great show...guiding us through the lower vessel where ghosts are known appear and make their mark. Great lighting and sound effects. My kids (aged 10 and 7) were constantly asking if it was real and had a tight grip on our hands. It far outweighed the haunted house at Universal Studios.",Jettsta
50,Don't miss this classic,"Wonderful ship with a great history. Some areas are undergoing restoration and most of the ship needs to be viewed on your own. Audio guide not helpful at this time due to restoration. But start by visiting the museum area and then go through hotel lobby to view the actual upper levels of the ship. Since admission to the ship costs $20 plus each, consider staying on board overnight as the restaurants are very good as well.",Paul W
50,Fun day trip from LA,We took the drive not sure if we would like this or not..but had a ball. Very beautiful ship rich in history. Cheesy tour but fun. Had drinks and watched seals and pelicans...,loozermama
30,So-So Tour,"we did the ghost story tour, which was ok. Too many people talking and trying to scare each other to really enjoy it. The Ghosts & Legends Show is a joke, just a haunted house that isn't scary at all. Ship is beautiful, but I don't feel worth the cost of the tours.",GhostHuntingDiva
50,A good day out,Did the haunted tour which was good and spent the day looking over the ship also went on Scorpian which is moored next to Queen Mary very interesting with lots of history.,airline65
50,worth a trip,"we did not do the tour, but went for dinner and wandered around the public areas...very interesting and the food was also plentiful and very good.",cat15
40,A Ship with Lots of History,"My husband and I were hotel guests on the Queen Mary from Nov. 18-20. We got to explore most of the ship and took the Haunted Encounters Tour. I think the best part of the ship is all of the original decor and historical exhibits. Many people probably don't know that the Queen Mary played an active part in WWII and was known as the ""Grey Ghost."" That is just one thing we learned while doing our self-guided tour. I'm sure the various walking tours are even more informative. The Haunted Encounters tour focuses only on those who have died aboard and the places where there are frequent ""hauntings."" If you are in Long Beach, definitely have a drink at the Observation Bar and take a stroll around this famous ship.",sophie832
30,Queen Mary - interesting,"Both my teenage daughter and I enjoyed the tour of the ship. Not much going on there in November, so very quiet. If you plan on paying by debit or credit card, check first that the computers are working - this was a negative and we ended up spending time in line with the one cash machine, since they were unable to take debit/credit. The other problem with their computer system down, the shows that should automatically play as you walk by a feature of the ship, won't work, so we missed part of the information during the tour. Headset tour is dated and doesn't match the stations, we were told this is because of a change in management. Not sure what that has to do with the attraction itself.It was worth going out there though - will probably be much better once the reno's are completed.",CRM433
50,The Queen II,"Again the area for a nice walk was amazing, since it was my first ship experience I don't know port from starboard, but i think the post side is where you board and the floor on that side is polished to a beautiful shine whil the starboard side is not. The port side has art work along the wall to enjoy as you walk but the starboard side does not. However the starboard side does have the nice deli where you can sit and rest from your walk or just to enjoy the view of the Long Beach downtown area, and of course the Pike it lit up at night which makes for a nice postcard.",SettlersBayAK
50,A Gem,"I loved walking through the ship, reading and learning about its history! It was so fascinating!",cshifrin
50,A Treasure,"What a neat step back in time. Great place for some photos, we took many on the deck at sunset. The dining room in incredible, and the food is tasty. Fun to explore the rooms and some neat little shops inside as well. A definitel must see in Long Beach.",Emmers33
10,Bad news,"the people when you leave to validate your ticket tried to overcharge me, I had to make them give my money back and the Queen Mary tour was overpriced and quite boring",smarttravels85
50,A sight to definitely see!,"I would recommend going to the Queen Mary in the mid-morning and planning on staying through the afternoon. There is a lot to see (between the tour(s) and gift shops. I think I counted 17 gift shops, which were all unique in their own way. There were not a lot of duplicate items either. If my husband goes back for another business trip, we would definitely think about staying in a room on the Queen Mary (even just for a night).",SandyB89
30,Long Live the Queen Mary attraction,"Visted the Queen Mary on our way to Anaheim for a 2 night stay. I was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the ship - it is huge. I felt quiet sad to think of something so British to be sited in America, but at least she is being looked after and preserved. The Ghost Tour was a waste of time and embarrassing. I think the “owners” wanted to add a bit of Disney to the attraction, but it isn’t necessary. The tour of the ship is very good, but allow plenty of time. We didn’t arrive until 1.30pm and had to do the Ghost Tour first, which didn’t leave enough time for the main tour. The headphones had to be returned by 5.00pm. We had a quick drink in the Observation Bar which was like stepping back in time. Unfortunately the Self-Guided Audio Tour isn’t well thought through. You start on R Deck for the Ghost Tour, exit on A Deck, then you have to get yourself to D Deck for the headphones, then you are up and down the decks, out of order, so you need to be quite fit for all the walking and steps. When we visit again, we will miss out the Ghost Tour and be better prepared for the non-logical order of the tour.",abnil
40,Really interesting day,"My wife and I visited this beautiful old ship on a misty day which made it even more atmospheric. The initial tour was through the engine room and lower deck where some of the original rooms from upstairs had been relocated to. The atmosphere was really quite chilled down there and very quiet and my wife couldn't wait to get out! - not surprised they have ghost tours around there....I did however find getting around the other decks in the rest of the ship very confusing and the sign posting was poorly organised. The staff didn't really seem to know much either?You actually enter the boat via the lifts in the hotel lobby entrance area but nobody told us that when we bought our tickets at the box office!The upper decks and the art deco shop/foyer area plus bar are beautiful and worth the cost of the admission alone. The view (once the morning mist had cleared) were excellent.Definitely worth a visit if you're in the Long Beach area.Thanks for reading my review, best regards, Tim",Timbob23
50,Hail to the Queen!,"The Queen Mary is a legend, and rightly so. This fabulous ship is permanently docked in Long Beach and offers a glorious range of unique experiences. An Art Deco masterpiece, her staterooms and banquet halls and corridors still glow with gorgeous burled wood paneling, brasswork and the original murals. The classic cocktail lounge near the bow is still fabulous, and as you sit sipping an elegant drink and watching the sunset reflected in the Long Beach skyline you'll definitely feel as though you've gone back in time to the glory days between ""the great wars.""It costs nothing to board the Queen Mary, but there are optional tours you can choose to pay for.If you'd like to really ""trip"" on this incredible ship, rent a stateroom and settle down for the night amid the original -- and beautiful Art Deco decor. Before turning in, take a late stroll on the decks and imagine yourself at sea in unparalleled luxury.There are several good restaurants in a variety of price ranges, and often there's entertainment in one of the cafes as well. The gift shops are filled with unique merchandise gathered from the many ports she visited in her prime.And, of course there are also the famous ghosts that haunt this ship, most of which are benign and may stop in to greet you during the night...Whether you visit for a few hours or stay for a few days, the Queen Mary will be one of the most entertaining and unique experiences you'll have -- in Long Beach or anywhere else in the world .",DSclar
20,Don't be fooled by the hype.,"I've stayed at the Queen Mary off and on since I was a child. As a child, staying on board at the hotel was an amazing treat, with all of the things to do and look at it was one of my fondest memories.Sadly, the Queen has fallen into disrepair, I stayed there last year in an attempt to rekindle some of the magic as a child. Most (if not all) of the attractions are gone. Walking the decks is pleasant enough and the bar (Queen's) in the foreward section of the boat was pleasant enough (though very expensive). Any of the tours are rather expensive, even if you've booked them through the hotel as a package. They are guided by salty teenagers (bordering on surly) and since the city of Long Beach has taken over, the Queen's just tired.She's in major need of a makeover, the rooms were cramped and dirty, there was hair in the tub with tons of scale on the fixtures. The floors were dirty and the small fan mounted on the wall (to help circulate air) was covered in dust and cobwebs.Of course there's the other people on board (it's a popular wedding place, though I don't know why) and on any weekend night you can bet you'll hear lots of drunken people yelling and carrying on either outside your room or in the room next door to yours. As we tried to turn in for the night (after a horrible and overpriced meal at Churchill's) the couple in the next room began their ""actitivities"" for the night, I have no issue with what people do in the privacy of their hotel room, drunk or not, I DON""T WANT TO HEAR IT!!!!!!!That was the capper for the stay and regretted my decision vowing to never return again.The ship itself is very tired and beat up looking, she's in serious need of paint and a good cleaning. Even the small arcade outside where there used to be nice little shops are now run down beat up tourist traps, offering cheap silkscreened t-shirts and crappy souvenirs.I was very dissappointed with this trip and felt the need to warn fellow travelers, should you decide to spend an evening on the Queen, expect very little.With the price of a 5 star hotel for a room, the place is a dump.Do not stay here if you can avoid it, go across the bridge and stay at one of the luxury hotels in downtown Long Beach, the prices are about the same (if not cheaper) and you won't be staying on rotting barge, or have to listen to your neighbors screaming most of the night.",SharkRescuer
50,The beautiful Queen Mary,"What a fabulous afternoon, well worth every dollar and being 57 I got an OAP ticket.... She is beautiful still, my dad worked on her when I was a child so I was eager to walk over her. From the engine room where you can even see her propeller to the bridge, it was special. We didnt bother with the 'haunted ship' ticket as that is the 'tourist' bit that you dont really need and just wandered around ourselves.",dartagnan36
40,Great Historic Experience,"Loved the tours, stayed the night and had a great meal. Only negative was on Saturday night there were lots of drunk wedding guests making a lot of noise",NicolaBurnieTasmania
40,Enjoyable stay,"We were really excited to be staying aboard The Queen Mary, check-in was great - very friendy and we were given a nice room. Recieved a tour and breakfast with our package, we opted for the history tour and loved it so much we bought the ghost tour as an add on, mainly so we could see the 1st class swimming pool (a must see.)The rooms are quite quirky, kind of what you'd expect - certainly an experence in its own right.Breakfast was great at the Promenade Cafe, flavoursome food with great views out to Long Beach and good service. We went along to the Observatory Bar, a little tired looking, cocktails were nothing special but sunset was lovely!The local authority put on free buses all around Long Beach, which are very regular to Long Beach. Would recommend a visit to he Aquarium of the Pacific and the Blue Whale Watching whilst staying here.All in all, would recommend, although be aware that much of the ship seems to be very different than it was originally, certainly not exactly as it would have been - it has certainly lost its charm.",JamesHacon
40,Different,"I live on an Island and there were certain elements of the Queen Mary that reminded me of the old ferries that used to sail from Ryde to Portsmouth. It's an interesting way to spend a day and there is a lot to see. The ghost tour is a bit cheesy but the views across the bay are beautiful.If you are not staying in Long Island, then make sure you allow enough time to catch the free bus which stops by the entrance and will take you to the town and sea front. don't try and drive there, just leave the car in the car park",nialltruan
50,A Little bit of History in the Real.,"I liked the displays, and the information about the history of the ship. It took us a couple of hours to get around to all the decks, and see all the parts. Good value, we bought the combination ticket, ( Queen Mary & Aquarium ) . You save $ 14. each, and you don't have to use both on the same day. Our legs were tired to we split it up over 2 days.",rocketman000
30,Out of date and touristy ...,Expensive. Old. Musty. But if you are a history buff - I guess it is a must see. Please skip the Ghost & Legends Tour. It was so lame and over the top just hokey. Not how I really wanted to spend a few hours and cash. But group I was with - really wanted to see it. All of us were disappointed.,Gracie17
40,"A must see, a step back in time!","The Queen Mary is a very well kept ship, the history is laying all over the place. I love the devoted care to the decor. The staff was wonderful the restruants/bars were nice. The drinks are pricey. Very nice place to hang out and enjoy the history. The rooms were true to their time. I liked them the bed was very comfortable and no ghosts disturbed our sleep. The Halloween attraction was little pricey but fun overall! We will be going their again when the Halloween things are not going one so we can enjoy a night paranormal tour!",andrakat
40,It's amazing!! You need to go see it! And do a tour!!!,Went there as a kid and always go see it!just the size of it alone! wow! and the tour to see the propeller! whew!alot of shows & movies are filmed there too!Halloween?!?!? WHEW!!! the festivities and the scary tours! get a package and go on one! even if you don't believe in ghosts you will be a bit nervous! and it's just fun!You can even stay the night there with a hotel being on the ship!it's a neat experience! it really is! we are looking at going out now before halloween and staying there after a tour! and then again....any creaking sounds will only be the ship...right!? LOLand you can see the Russian sub and see the beautiful view of Long beach across the water at night! Very nice!! bring the camera! you will want memories!!!You can go there for free and some things will cost you!That's everywhere!,hbsurfer1
10,A major disappointment.,"The ship has many interesting things to see, and the submarine next to it is worth visiting. However, do NOT take anyone who has difficulty walking up stairs, At the beginning of the visit, one has to get to a high(er) level. The escalator has been inoperable for months! If there is an elevator, we were not told. Similarly, we were not told that the art gallery had been broken into the night before our visit and was closed. That we found out after climbing the broken escalator the second time. Do NOT rent the headphones for the self-guided visit. Despite the recorded ""instructions,"" which are often terrible, you will get lost many times and probably never find some of the numbered locales. No signs anywhere. Hard to believe that someone has not been fired.",CalifJ0e
50,great place to visit,Amazing and huge. Had lunch and went into the little shops. Enjoyed the ghost tour It was like a step back in history.Winston Churchill's cabin was like he was there.The tour takes you thru the entire ship from the bottom to the top lots of walking but so interesting the guide gives you facts and gossip.,Bridgetpianos
50,Worth seeing!,"We bought the package for the senior rate of around $29 apiece. That included a self tour of the Russian sub, the Scorpion, docked adjacent to the QM, a self-tour of the QM, and a one hour guided tour of the QM. It was well worth the admission and the one hour guided tour {led by a gentleman named James} was informative and very entertaining. Rather than pay the ridiculous $12 parking fee, we walked from our vacation rental on East Ocean Blvd to the Aquarium area where we caught the free shuttle to the QM. IF you are visiting Long Beach, this is a ""must see."" NOTE: Movie and entertainment buffs will enjoy hearing about the movies filmed aboard the QM and also being in the room where Bob Hope and Fred Astaire performed.",Sandman3858
40,Had a Blast,"I visited the Queen Mary earlier this year with my grown children. I have read a few very negative reviews on here but I have to say that ""We had a blast!"" We took both the more serious ghost tour and the funny theaterical one. I have to say that we enjoyed the hoaky one the most and we got some good laughs out of it. The serious ghost tour was sort of lame. It was automated with sections where you just watch a video and the guide was not impressive.We loved the ship so much we actually stopped at the front desk to see if they had rooms available for the night.We went to the art deco lounge during happy hour. We ordered drinks and a selection of half price appetizers. We had a lot of fun in the lounge. We had a wonderful waitress who told us a better ghost story than the earlier guide. Food was great and price was wonderful. It was mid-afternoon so pretty empty.Only down side was one of our group got separated from us and we had a time finding her. I was a little upset because my cell phone was dead and none of the staff would help us call her. We actually stopped in a gift shop and ice cream shop and they both turned us away. Another visitor overheard and let us use their cell phone. I did feel a little let down that in this instance their customer service was not the best.Overall it was a great experience. I would love to go back and spend a night there.",Kimberly B
50,fun tour,"This is a remarkable ship. Touring on your own is fun, but take the Ghosts tour and find out the incredible history of this ship. When I worked there I had my own ghost encounter. I was posted at the Spruce Goose when it was there and when I went for lunch at the Pig and Whistle, the empoyee diner I had my ID and a $1.00 in my pocket. When I went to pay for my sandwich the dollar was gone, so I borrowed. When I got back to my place at the Spruce Goose I put my hand in my pocket and the dollar was back with my ID. Touring on your own is free, there is a fee for the guided tour and it is so worth it.",cmmorley
10,"A complete waste of your time and money. Seriously, don't do it!","We actually stayed on board the Queen Mary for one night and when we booked our room, the reservation department said that if you are staying on board, that you get a discount on the tours of which there are a few of them to do.We had chosen the Paranormal Ghost Walk tour as it fit our schedule and we like doing 'haunted walks' when we go to places as they are usually good fun.So, when we went to pick up our tickets, we were told it is $50 p/person and that there wouldn't be a discount. That's really expensive no matter what type of tour you would be getting and we should have said 'no' at that point. Unfortunately, having a credit card makes it easy to just charge it.There were two guys giving the tour. One main guy and one backup. Both have the personality of paint drying and the one giving the tour is particularly annoying.I don't know how I can explain how boring this tour is and how much of a waste of time and money it is. Please, please, please don't do it.You are better off just going around the ship on your own (which you can do) or if you really want to do a tour, do one that is cheap and not this one. It's a cash grab of the worse kind. I had to take an ear full from the missus when I got back to the room about how bad it was so if I can save you that by taking my advice, then maybe something good will have come from it.Don't do it.",Fr3lncr
40,The Queen Mary - Extraordinary highs and disappointing lows,"First, let me say that the Queen Mary is now almost 80 years old, but still a sight to see. If you've spent time on a modern cruise ship, you can tell that the Queen Mary must have been a grand adventure in her day, and very much ahead of her time. You should arrive early in the day in order to see everything she has to offer. Your best bet is the self-guided tour. Don't be afraid to explore - there are ""crew only"" signs telling you where you can't go. Otherwise, the ship is yours, including the magnificent bridge. In my opinion, though, you should avoid the ""Ghosts of the Queen Mary"" tour. It's little more than a haunted house, with effects that were assembled by a well-meaning group of high school kids. With the technology available, they could have done so much more. Imagine, inctead of strobe lights and a loud PA system, a holographic image of the little girl said to haunt the first-class pool appearing next to the visitors and crying for her mother, then screaming, ""get out!"". Oh well, it is what it is. Dine there, walk around, stay overnight. Imagine being there in 1936.",Global-track
10,Do NOT do this!,"This was the saddest tour I have ever taken! My sister had looked up reviews on Trip Advisor saying not to do this and I talked her into doing it anyway and she and TripAdvisor were right! What's the saddest part is that this attraction could be so awesome! We took the Ghost Tour and it was the lamest thing you ever saw. The story of the Queen Mary is fascinating and the fact that Long Beach as a city bought this ship to use as an attraction is admirable. Unfortunately, the ship is in great need of renovation. It is tired and it shows. I hope someone gets this boat into ship-shape, fast!Also, the cost for the tour was very expensive and OVER PRICED!!!",CathyWest
30,Prepare to get lost,"When we arrived (and paid WAY TOO MUCH) we were directed to the back of the ship to start our tour. We walked inside and toured a few rooms, but couldn't find a way up or to other sections of the ship. When I went and asked the girl at the desk, she explained that the tour in the brochure wasn't really that accurate and we needed to go to another part of the ship. Then, when we finally walked most of the marked areas, I wasn't impressed at all. Not much of the ship has been preserved and the examples of the different types of rooms were located in little cubicles! Couldn't they have renovated a room on each level to look like the originals. A few areas, like the captains rooms, etc. have been kept, but it's only a small part of the ship. So sad! But if you want to buy souvenirs, there are tons of shops for that!",KidsInT0w
50,Great destination dining!,"We started with cocktails in the Art Deco Lounge and had the pleasure of sipping cocktails during the Art Deco festival - groups were dressed to the ""9's"" in their 1920's best. (One group broke out into 3-part harmony to a couple who were obviously recently married.) We enjoyed the classic dinner menu at Sir Winston's where we ordered the Dover sole (a very unique presentation but very good), salmon and porterhouse steak. One person in our party required gluten-free items and the waiter/chef was happy to oblige. Our evening ended in the attached lounge for after dinner drinks with a wonderful singer at the piano.We all enjoyed the evening and I would definitely recommend this restaurant!(Note: there is no fee for admission but they do collect a parking fee.)",Nancy Z
40,"Interesting, but a bit hard to navigate through facility.","We went thre as a family and everyone enjoyed it. The tickets are bit high for what you get. The self guided tour is confusing and alot of the ship is hotel now, so you are literally walking through halls past people's rooms! The map they gave us was a little hard to figure out where we were and got lost...but that added to the fun also! The Ghost and Legends show was great and the kids really enjoyed it. Little ones may not enjoy the Ghost and Legends show if they scare easily, or have issues with loud noises. I would say great attraction for kids eight and above, younger than that...go to the aquarium instead.",co1470
50,Great Paranormal Ship-walk Experience,"I took a group of teenage Girl Scouts to the Queen Mary Paranormal Ship-walk and we had a great time. We have been in search of ""ghosts"" for the past three years, and short of a wonderful Ghost Trolley tour in Monterrey, California, this was one of the best!!! We were seven gals of a fairly large group of about 35-40 people. We have some skeptics in our Troop, but have maybe made them believers of the paranormal after this Tour. I ordered our tickets ahead of time by phone, and was very happy when they were waiting for us at the Will Call window. Our tour guide seemed to be very knowledgeable in the history of the Queen Mary, which the first part of the tour gives you an overview of. On the tour we saw some 'divining rods' turn in one tour member's hands, which was pretty neat, but then in the Engine Room where the diving rods moved, we had the tour guides Mag flashlight turn off and on by an apparent male entity. Two rooms later, in the Swimming Pool Room, we saw three flashlights go off and on by who was supposed to be a female 'energy'. The tour guide was asking the 'girl' to turn his flashlight off an on which she did when he asked, but then two other members of the tour group had the same type of Mag flashlights and set theirs on the table too. The tour guide would ask for the 'girl' to turn on the two outer lights, which she would do, then the middle one, which she would do, then he'd ask her to turn one off at a time, which she did. It was really quite amazing, and there wasn't a good explanation for it other than the paranormal. Our skeptics came out of this tour saying that they were going to have to rethink their attitude on our 'ghost hunting'. I thought it was well worth the $50.00 each we paid, and if I get the opportunity to go again, I will. We have been many places in California looking for ghosts, and we think we were the closest we'll ever get at the Queen Mary!",Cookieandfamily
50,Queen Mary overnight is a must!,This was a great overnight with the kids. A little scarry (fun) for the kids on the haunted tour. This would be a great October stay if you are looking for some spooky fun. A nice romantic overnight too.,mjmae
50,Great attraction for boat and grandeur lovers,"I went to see the Queen Mary as it looks a lot like the Titanic (from the outside). I did the Ghosts&Legends show which shows you places in the ship (boiler room, swimming pool) otherwise not accessible. Then I did the self-guided audio tour (all these things with a General Admission ticket) and had a blast finding out things about the ship. The audio tour however does NOT guide you through the entire ship.You don't need a ticket to enter the ship (as it's a hotel also), so for basic sightseeing, you can just enter it.You may be disappointed if you expect to see interior like in the Titanic movie, it's so not that. Imagine carpets & wooden floors rather than expensive tile floors. The ship is rather old looking (in a bad way) than antique looking. There is no nice stairway either ;-)Make sure you bring walking shoes, as my feet hurt a lot after the miles I walked on the ship, looking for hidden rooms and trying to take perfect pictures :-) Don't forget suncream for the little ones, it can be really hot on the ship.I took about 3 hours to do the tour & show and I would advise you to take at least this amount of time.What I did miss was a gift shop with Queen Mary books/blueprints (maybe I missed it, the boutiques in the hotel lobby were rather disappointing).For those interested in how to get there, the Metro Blue line stops at Long Beach Transit Mall (end of the line) and you can easily take the Pasport C bus, which goes to the aquarium and ends at the Queen Mary. I visited on a Sunday and the bus service was free!",SabbeRubbish
40,A Great Way to Spend The Day,We took the self guided tour.Roamed around checking out the ship at our own pace.Ate lunch at the Promenade Cafe- it was delicious.I recommend it to everyone to see this great ship at least once - it is a big part of history .a bit creepy and scary in cetain areas i understand why they say it is haunted ...,goingblonde
50,wonderful experience,"We did the behind the scenes tour, ghost encounter tour, and the haunted tour. It was well worth it. When you buy your tickets you are assigned a time. Everything flowed smoothly with no lag in times. We were there almost 6 hours so make it a day trip. Cost was around $35 a person. You can also stay on the ship overnight, and there are places to eat on the ship and shop as well. Well worth the visit.",pemeigh
30,What an improvement,"I had visited the Queen Mary a few years ago and I was literally disgusted with how they could let a ship like he fall into such disgrace. I am happy to say someone new took her over and she is now ship shape.It is easy to walk around the decks and imagine what it must have been like in her glory to be out on the high seas surrounded by luxury. The teak wood is found on nearly every level, there is a beautiful bar that has been refurbished and is open, you can tour the captain's living quarters, as well as the bridge. There are restaurants, exhibits and tours available.Part of the old ship has converted the old state rooms into hotel rooms and after wandering around, not on purpose we got lost, we passed by some levels of the ship where it is a hotel and she is absolutely beautiful and I would love the opportunity to stay there some time.We did the ghost tour on board the ship, while a bit corny it was quite enjoyable and gave you an insight to the past when she was converted to a troop carrier during WWII before being restored back into a luxury liner.",DiabloDeb
40,"cool part of history, ghost tour a bit corny","I agree with some other reviews, the ghost tour was corny and disney-esq. They have dark passages with smoke machines and speakers w people screaming. It was still cool to go that far down in the boat. The guided tour was nice and the tour guide made it interesting. It was neat to see the old rooms and see how rich people used to travel, before the days of air travel. Art deco style is fun to see outside of south beach. The tour takes you into a suite that people stay in today and most of it is original. They have a few cool gift shops too. Make sure to also take the tour of the submarine next door.",bebedani
50,This day was awesome!,"We took an extended summer vacation to California(3 weeks)to see the sights and visit family. I like to plan something special for the first and last day of each vacation to make it memorable, so we planned Sunday brunch on the Queen Mary. The ship is permanently docked in Long Beach and is currently a hotel. We purchased entertainment books that gave us a BOGO (we bought two-it was worth it for 4 of us) and the all-you- can- eat, bottomless champagne brunch worked out to about $20.00 apiece before gratuity. This art deco masterpiece is worth a visit even w/o the spectacular brunch.The ship is open to all brunch-goers to explore after eating and there is much to see.The only area not open to the public are the staterooms that are part of the hotel. We managed to get ""lost"" down a hallway and caught a glimpse of a room that was being tidied. The brunch is served in the Grand Ballroom with beautiful detail-truly elegant-to the room and the food. There was even a Nat King Cole look-a-like crooning from a 30's mic atop the cold station. If you ever get the chance to enjoy this wonderful experience, I highly recommend it . Just watch your sea legs after that bottomless champagne!",Paticu
40,Was worth the stop. After all it's free if you don't buy a tour.,"We just took the elevator up and walked around the ship. We walked end to end on each floor. I know the signs say only hotel guests on the hotel floors, but who's keeping track anyway. It was interesting from a historical and engineering perspective. There is a neat photography exhibit. Spent half an hour alone in there alone, excellent photos.There's no way I'm paying for some wacko paranormal tour. I didn't think the normal tour sounded all that interesting either. So we just walked around and went through any areas that were open to us.We ate at the nicer restaurant on board and I'm glad we did. The staff were incredibly helpful and some of the nicest people I've ever met.The ship does need some maintenance. Hopefully they will find a way to restore some areas.",Nicnatros
10,Sad Expierence,"The ticket sales associate directed me to the front of the ship to start my tour. The attendant there re directed me to the stern of the ship to start my tour. there I was told to wait for a tour guide who never showed, if tour guide showed he/ she failed to announce start of tour. 15 minutes later I inquired about tour and was told it left on time. b My comment to attendent was why didn't tour guide annouce the start of tour. Attendant shrugged shoulders and offered to re schedule another tour 2 hours later. Complaints to other employees was no help. this was a waste of my time and I will never visit this attraction again to many steps for seniors no elevators.",grobnbarba
50,A hotel like none other!,"This is definitely worth a trip -- in fact, we extended our stay from one night to 2 once we realized how magnificent this hotel / ship was. Considering the uniqueness of this hotel, the rate is more than reasonable. The staff is very kind. We found the rooms to be very nice, with no problems. We took a couple of tours, which were each very entertaining. But unless you're into the whole ghosts thing, skip the Haunted Encounters tour -- at $50 a head, it's pretty pricey. You can see many of the same spots in the Behind-the-Scenes tour, for much less money.There's not much to eat on board, especially if you have little ones along. It's either Sir Winstons (upscale), or a snack-bar type place. But you can drive to several restaurants in less than 10 minutes.There are several exhibits throughout the ship and below decks illustrating the history of this magnificent ship. Also, don't miss the shops on the Promenade level (but skip the Scottish Heritage shop -- the storekeeper there was pretty rude from the second we stepped into the shop, for no apparent reason). Many thanks to the front desk staff, to the gentleman in the Promenade souvenir shop (the one on the starboard side, with the model planes) and also to Zach with the tours -- these people are the reason we will be back! I highly recommend the Queen Mary Hotel!",CDF71
20,Sad Old Ship,this ship and attraction has seen it's better days. the self guided tour is a bit disjointed and not nearly as well done as many other places we have visited. Parking cost are just plain stupid. time can be better spent elsewhere.,GAM
40,"A step back in time, and up in luxury","If you like the deco period and have an interest in how the uppercrust lived and traveleled in the 20's & 40's, or if you like maritime history or military history, you'll enjoy a visit to the Queen Mary. I took the self-guided audio tour, which also included the Ghosts and Legends Tour. The Ghosts & legends Tour was a little hokey, but kids will love it and it made me chuckle a couple of times. The nice thing is that it is led by real people and is not all automated.The self-guided audio tour is well worth the cost if you have any interest at all in the history of the ship or what it was like on board for workers, tourists, or during wartime. You can move around most of the ship entirely at your own pace, and you are free to open doors and walk down corridors and hallways that are not officially on the tour.The art-deco styling of the ship is magnificent. I found the display of old radios in the communications area pretty interesting. Although it's a walking tour, you can rest whenever you want, and there are plenty of places to sit down, including lots of great benches and even a few deck chairs on the outside decks. You can eat in any of the restaurants, visit the spa, and pretty much go anywhere that hotel guests go other than into their private rooms.If you've taken a cruise lately, you'll be amazed at the contrast in design between your cruise ship and the Queen Mary. The Queen Mary is so much more spacious and elegant. It's wonderful to see true hardwood decks, marble floors, brass banisters, etc. than to see the plastic, concrete, enamel and neon ships of today.",kleetampa
10,Worth a look,Went on the ghosts n legends and self guided tour aprill 2011. The ghost tour was a little corny but it was interesting just the same. Kind of disney haunted mansion like. Not a serious ghost hunt. The areas we visited were very interesting. The self guided tour was fun just exploring the old ship and exhibits. If your in to history you'll enjoy exploring the old ship. If there 's anything to be improved on it's the price of parking,Travelindad43
50,GREAT PLACE! A MUST SEE!,"We had a wonderful time! Love the history, our guide was awesome! We feel it is worth going. It has a beautiful setting. The ship is beautiful. We ate & stayed as well. We were very pleased & will go again.",BeachyBumm
10,Definately not worth the money.,Access to the more interesting parts of the ship was severely limited if you took a self guided tour. The Queen Mary tour is all about shaking down the tourists for the maximum amount of money for the minimum amount of value. Just a total ripoff. Spend your money elsewhere.,harveywelch
30,An out-dated ship,"We didn't take any tours. Just went for lunch and walked about the shops. Nothing special about shops. The food was average, but expensive. The service was incredibly slow. Took over 45 mins to get our steak and fish and chips.If you have taken any cruises of late, this ship looks really old and outdated. May be of interest to anyone who wants the history, but as a ship not that impressive.",32655Michelle
40,Queen Mary - can see much of the grandeur,"Overall, we really enjoyed the Queen Mary. We started out planning on the self guided tour, but at 4:00 were told we only had an hour until 5 because they close at 6 (seriously? they weren't busy). We decided not to do that and went to the restaurant. As it turns out, that worked really well. We got to see the top main deck, and there were stairs up to some higher decks where you could get a really neat view of the shore and mountains.The ship itself we found to be in very good condition. It has been refurbed, but most of it is original. The exhibits were also quite interesting - didn't know the ship brought over 22,000 war brides from England!We enjoyed the art deco Observation lounge. Drinks and appetizers were very reasonable during happy hour. There are also a couple restaurants available.Bottom line - well worth a free visit. The most disappointing was that only one staff member was helpful as far as the ship, where to go and history.",Laura R
30,Interesting but pricey for what it is,"We were in Long Beach specifcally to go on a whale watching trip and since we were there figured we would make a day of it. Because of the whale watching trip, we weren't able to book any of the guided tours. Instead we did the self guided tour. It was interesting, but seemed overpriced for what it was. Also if you have any kind of mobility disability it would be tough to do and downright impossible to see some of the decks. Historically it was just amazing that people were able to construct such a massive ship such a long time ago. Someone did tell us the guided tour was much better.",travelinggurl
40,Must See if You are Interested in Big Ships!,"If you have an interest in ships and you are in the Long Beach area, you must visit the Queen Mary. There is a lot of history in the ship, along with some haunting tales. The Ghosts and Legends Tour was kind of a joke. We went on it only because it was included in the Go Los Angeles card. I was more interested in the ship itself, and being a Titanic buff and all, I wanted to see for myself how large these ships and their lifeboats are. I had never seen an ocean liner before in my life before I saw the Queen Mary. The self-guided tour is the best way to go (unless you do want a guided tour).",pilotgirl21
50,Must see in Long Beach,"The ship has a lot of history to see, if you have enough time, audio self-guided tour and the-behind-the-scene tour are high recommended.Especially for the-behind-the-scene tour, our tour guide is very very informative and gave me a lot of history lessons. He even showed us a suite Churchill stayed in.",bigcakechen
30,No history or glamour here...,"I visited with my sister and we did the self-guided tour with the Ghosts and Legends Tour, and that was awful. Really vague historical info, no mention of any actual ghosts or legends that make the Queen Mary intriguing, and just truly terrible special effects and HORRIBLE blaring soundtrack. They take you into places that would be very interesting on their own, like the boiler room and the 1st class swimming pool, and ruin them with fog machines and fake demon decorations. After that they let you on your own and you have the option of checking out headphones. We chose to explore on our own and found the ship to be run down, with the fancy decorations broken, elevators closed, paint chipping, etc. The historic exhibits were a joke. You would think you would get to see an actual stateroom, but no, they ""recreate"" one on the lower deck and it looks really sad. The most interesting rooms, the dining halls and lounges, were closed to the public!!!Overall we were looking forward to seeing a grand ship that royalty and stars frequented and we got a sad old ship being neglected and used as a pathetic tourist trap. I actualy felt bad for the ship!We got a $10 off coupon from visitcalifornia, so the cost wasn't that bad, but it still seemed overpriced for what you see. Don't got if you're looking for history.",COtoAK
30,"Cool to see the old ship, but worth the money?","When we arrived at the Queen Mary it was about 2:30 therefore we were unable to take most of the tours so we took the only tour left, it was a haunted tour (not the night ghost one). They take you in a room and show you a 15 mins video about the history of the Queen Mary and all of its deaths and hunting's, then they take you on a guided tour to the spots that they showed you in the video that deaths had happened, they then try to scare you by using effects like lights going out, shadows, fog machines, etc. All in all it was pretty cool to see, i am kind of a baby when it comes to anything haunted therefore I'll admit i was a bit scared, but to the average person who can go into a haunted house this wont scare you. But it is still very interesting to learn the history of the Queen Mary. After the haunted tour they gave you until 5pm to do a self guided tour of the ship, most of it being just a hotel there was still observation decks to visit and a few shops to see, we saw nothing like the reviews said tho... no restaurants and very few shops, but with the limited time we didn't get threw the whole ship. So was it worth the $25? Well I'll leave that up to you... All i can say is that i know if i hadn't done it i would have wanted to and probably would have the next time i visited!",xnovavoltagex
10,Terrible!,Save your money! The ghost tour was awful. I expected some legends and stories but just got poor special effects. What a huge disappointment!,Amanda93057
20,Don't bother unless you are physically active and into old ships.,"My friend and I were anxious to see how the grand old dames of the sea compared to our new cruise ships. And we came away very disappointed in many ways. The ship is badly in need of a cleaning and facelift. Too much rust, peeling paint and a general shabby appearance. However, the worst part was the many, many stairs that must be climbed in order to see everything. We were not warned either by sign or by ticket seller that this would be a physically challenging tour for anyone with hip or knee problems. There are two escalators in one area, but they are both broken (and from others we spoke with, have been broken for a long time). This necessitates climbing a very high escalator which is even steeper than the stairs. Also, there are very few signs posted giving directions as to where you go next. The audio equipment we were given did verbally give directions but they were sometimes confusing and would have been helped greatly by visual signs.One good thing - we ate lunch in the Promenade Cafe, and the view of the harbor and the food were both very good. But all-in-all, this was not an experience I would repeat.",Marcia S
30,Worth a visit but avoid the ghost tour,"I looked forward to my tour of the Queen Mary with great anticipation, the ghost tour should have been a highlight. Instead it was nothing more than very quick (and very dark) tour through the ""haunted areas"" of the ship with very poor special effects! The ghost tour was very big disappointment for me... it just seemed like a bad House of Horrors ride at Disneyland!The self guided tour of the rest of the Queen Mary is highly recommended, and very interesting.If anyone from the Queen Mary is reading this, please drop the tacky special effects and have a normal tour through the haunted areas?",Sandyspanner
10,Terrible. Do not spend the 25 dollars. I...,Terrible. Do not spend the 25 dollars. I didn't get an audio even though one was included in my ticket. The only rooms you see are the engine room and the bridge.They also have a cheesy exhibit and some shops and resturants. The shop is impressive. The tour is anything but.,Bryan11277
20,A very disappointing tour of what might be a great ship,"Today we visited the Queen Mary. Traffic caused us to be late so we didn't get tickets until 3:50pm. We were told the Audio tours stopped dishing out at 4pm, so we had to rush to the end of the ship to get them. Had to deposit my driving licence and they close at 5pm for return, even though the ship closed at 6pm (typical stupidity)! So... we rush through the many stops on the audio tour. Up many stairs to start, down many stairs to the engine room, up again, to the front of the ship up more stairs to the bridge, down again, see the bar (very nice area), back towards the back of the ship. By this time we had seen a fair bit of the ship, but none of the opulence one might think would be there. Any beautiful dining room or ballroom wth beautiful chandeliers were certainly not on this tour. True, there was some art deco around the place, but some old cinemas in the UK have the same - and some better. My wife and I felt that this could almost be a cross channel ferry. We did see the dining room along the side of the ship which a Forte's motorway stop could be proud of (sorry, they've gone now, haven't they?). So we came to the last stops on the audio tour - back to the Engine room area to see the anchor etc. - we decided we'd had enough, it wasn't worth the energy expenditure, and anyway, we had to get the audio guides back before 5pm, otherwise I was minus a driving licence. We could have wandered around afterwards, and possibly even done a Ghost Tour (included in the price), but we'd lost the will to live by this time.",DavidE1945
40,Is it haunted? Maybe... Is it a whole lot of fun?... Most Definitely!,"Our final day in L.A. was spent as amazingly as the last five... but, now aboard the world-renowned Queen Mary! When we arrived, our first stop wasn't the tour ticket purchase counter, but the check-in counter. That's right, we stayed the night aboard the Queen Mary. We did purchase tickets for the Haunted Encounters Tour (the best in my opinion) and before the tour started, we brought our bags to our room. Every room has an amazing view of the water. We have never been on a cruise, so having port holes as windows was kind of strange. The Haunted Encounters Tour stops at several of the reportedly most haunted rooms and spots aboard the ship, including: the pool, the shower stalls, the Churchill Suite, and the single-handedly most haunted room on her, Room #13. This room had to be shut down after one too many incidents had occurred in there (don't let the tour make you think twice about sleeping aboard her). After the tour, we bought some souvenirs. As long as something doesn't say ""Crew Members Only"", you are free to roam wherever you may wish. We had dinner at Sir Winston's on the Sun Deck. This is a very classy restaurant and while it is said that casual clothing is permitted, many dress up. After staying the night, we dragged out our trip a little longer and had breakfast at the Shoreline Village. A shuttle takes you there and back with a stop at the Aquarium of the Pacific along the way. The last thing we did was take the Ghosts and Legends Tour (which is very nicely done). We walked around the QM Historic Exhibit and then got in the car for the 4 1/2 drive back home to Vegas.",travelertrip96
50,Well worth the detour to see the wonders of the Queen Mary,"Stopped off at Long beach on the way down from LA to Anaheim to see the Queen Mary. We took a tour of the boat (paranormal activity) as part of our look around the boat. This was excellent. The kids were totally freaked out. Have to admit that I jumped a couple of times when we got to different sections of the boat that had spooky tails to tell. After the tour we were free to wander around the boat, and or take a conducted tour.The boat gives you an insight of times past and the decadence of travelling by sea, as the kids say ' in the olden days'.. Well worth a look see.",bossladymum
10,It's been three hours since we left the...,"It's been three hours since we left the queen Mary and I have to report that my entire sinus system is still burning from the intense mold on board the ship and we were only there for 3 hours. I can't imagine spending the night - we walked through the lobby and down the hotel hallways - the smells were just stomach turning. To put this into perspective, in my 46 years, I have never smelled mold like this - in fact, I have probably only smelled mold once before - I'm not super sensitive. I honestly don't know how the employees stand it. We also took the ghost tour which is part of the general admission package. We left about 10 minutes into it - after a short movie, they escort you to the ""first class pool"" - they then turn off the lights and steam up the room. Aside from the extreme corniness, the smell was putrid. After spending 120 for mt family of 5 to view the ship, we decided to leave this ""ghost tour"" early so to not waste even more time.The best part of the ship is viewing it from the outside- save your money - everything you read and learn inside, you can read on wikipedia. It should also be noted that all of the escalators and all of the elevators were broken. And I mean ALL!!!",Tsskrs
50,Last of her Kind ... Fantastic Historic Ship,"We've visited the Queen Mary last year in June and are going back this year in October.Many people don't realize the important role the Queen Mary has played in history, and that she is the LAST survivor of an era long gone by. Read up on the Queen Mary before you go (there are some really interesting books), and make sure you stay in the hotel overnight. Go to Sir Winston's Restaurant for a posh dinner, and imagine what a crossing of the Atlantic would have been like, on this first and last great super liner. The Queen Mary did 1,001 crossings of the Atlantic, held the Blue Ribband as the fastest ship in the world for 16 years, and transported over 2 Million people in her 30 some years of service, before she was retired in 1967.You can't compare the Queen Mary with Disneyland or any of the brand-new attractions that continuously try to outdo each other. This is not a place that's shiny & brand new; this is an elegant, old fashioned ocean liner that once transported Kings & Queens, Heads of State, and Hollywood Royalty alike.Every time you stay in a hotel in Los Angeles you have a choice to make: Support a historic place or give your money to a big chain hotel. We've made our decision on this topic, and vow to help keep the Queen around as long as humanly possible!",hough2market
10,Don't waste your time!!,"Oh my gosh, we just got home after an over-night visit to the Queen Mary specifically to go on this Paranormal ""investigation"". Frankly I could not have been more dissatisfied with wasting my $225 ($75 pp), than if I had simply set my cash on fire and watched it burn. All the way home we were trying to put together a review, but after reading FILMSHARK'S review, we could not have said it better ourselves. After listening to this guy for over 3 hours I would never tune in to his radio show either. The words arrogant and pompous come to mind. Regardless of one's beliefs about 'ghost hunting', this guy made us feel dumb for being there before the tour even started! Other than earning a fast buck and dissing every paranormal show created, it's hard to understand this guy's motives...Don't waste your time or money going on this overbooked, noisy and annoying tour....The Queen Mary is interesting on her own. Go with your small group, take the self guided tour and you'll probably have more luck bumping into a spirit than we did!!!!",VinoLoco
50,Well worth it's money!,"My wife and i visited QM on our trip trough California! The ghost and legend tour is -altough we don't believe in ghost- scary good. But this is only a small part of what there is to discover. If you are somebody who loves oceanliners and the way they are engineered, this is really the thing you are looking for, they let you wander around the whole ship, from the decks, the bridge to the engine rooms... you get to see it all. And al on your own pace. My wife and i had planned to visit the ship in 3 hours but it took us 5 hours to see it all, there is also an overload of information about the QM if you are in to history. And the reviews who said that the QM looked unmaintained etc...? The ship is almost 80 years old and you see that but that is part of the charm of the QM. If you park on the lot at QM it will cost 12 dollar. So you can park at the aquarium parking for 8 dollar and at the shoreline village they come to pick you up every 20 minutes, for free!! To bad that the QM is so underrated!!",roxydogTielt
10,Paranormal Tour -- Better off with a Book,"For those considering the ""hands on"" experience of the midnight Paranormal ""Investigators"" Tour, trust the voices from beyond and save your dough for Disneyland instead.Our only expectations going in were to ramble through the stairwells and hallways with a guide who might provide a little history, insights into ""hotspots"", and a chance to soak in the vibe of the place. No such luck. We were provided a guide (a self-proclaimed paranormal expert and ""radio host"") who, while articulate enough, had the personality of a sack of damp wool and seemed to want to debunk paranormal activity before we even set foot beyond the gift shop. After a grueling half hour of his review of tools of the trade (including digital tape recorders, heat sensors and EMF meters), we were provided those same items, along with dousing rods and plastic tubes with rubber bulbs on the end, and lead along into the bowels of the ship. To do what, I don't know. Baste a spectral turkey, I suppose.Taken from place to place with a dozen other hopeful souls, we experienced a monologue by our debunker-guide about why we would be unlikely to see or hear anything unusual. In fact, we were, in for all intent and purpose, advised that we would be more likely to be killed by Ugandan terrorists while tethered there to the dock in Long Beach than to see or hear anything remotely paranormal...hhhuh?? It begged the question, why have a tour when the guides themselves don't believe in what is being presented? Greater still, why pay $75 a head for that process. To make matters worse, when the guide wasn't prattling on about all the magnificent things we WEREN'T going to see, we had to listen to the constant drone on our fellow tourmates who felt compelled to fill every instant of potential silence with subdued giggles, whispers, foot scuffling and muffled bodily eruptions, such that the chances of actually hearing or feeling something paranormal there carried the same odds as Francis the Mule winning the Breeder's Cup. If there were spirits there, I would imagine they fled with their hands over their translucent ears the second we set foot inside the ship. It was maddening enough to make me want to insert my turker baster in someone's posterior orifice.In the end, we got back to the hotel at 4 am and woke with enough time to go to Disneyland, which is were we should have gone in the first place. At least the Haunted Mansion has spooks you know won't let you down.",filmshark
30,Expensive -- Don't Go Out of Your Way to Visit,"I was really looking forward to visiting the Queen Mary, I had seen it for years in magazines and on TV. Overall I’d agree with many of the other reviewers who felt that the Queen Mary, as an attraction, was over priced and many of the exhibits on the self-guided tour were showing signs of age/neglect. The Queen Mary is a grand ship and would remain a fascinating destination for years-to-come if the owners would simply invest some money to make the tour more interactive and up-to-date. We paid the extra $10 each on went on the hour-long guided ghost tour. Our tour guide, Summer, did a great job and we were able to see parts of the ship apparently not included on the self-tours. My teenagers really liked the Ghost tour, it probably saved the visit for all of us, otherwise I think we would have been disappointed with the Queen Mary if we only went on the self-tour. The few times we saw any staff and flagged them down to ask questions they were friendly but usually not very helpful. Parking was $15 dollars the day we were there and we ended up staying about 3-4 hours. One exhibit, not to be missed, is in the engine-room. They have cut-away part of the ship so that you can see the last-remaining propeller that is still in place, we almost walked past it by accident, besides the ghost tour, we all agreed this was the most interesting thing we saw.",aperio
50,What a gem!,"Champagne Sunday brunch in the original first-class dining room, which is quite a value and includes the self-guided tour (normally $24). Definitely, a must do if you are doing a weekender cruise. Make sure you look up when you do the tour - the ceilings are exquisite!",SWJodi
10,Huge Disappointment,"After a magnificant week's vacation to southern California, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon, my wife and I decided to wrap up our holiday with a tour of the Queen Mary. Sadly, the QM experience left us feeling cheated and ripped off. The grand old lady was in a very sad state of repair and neglect. It is clearly evident no money is being spent on her upkeep and she is in a serious state of deterioration. Our self-guided tour was to start at 10:00am, however gates were still padlocked at 10:20 at which time a security guard was called to open them. Escalators were out of service, the self-guided audio tour was very unorganized, many of the rooms were closed (bridge) or off limits (pool and grand ballroom) and common areas were in desperate need of upkeep (decking on promenade and lifeboats). Considering the value for the money charged, this attraction was a huge disappointment. The final insult was the parking fee of $12.00 considering we were only at the exhibit for an hour and one-half. Tourists anticipate and expect attractions such as the Queen Mary to be living historical museums, referbished and shown in the grandeur of their time. For this, they are prepared to pay good money. Sadly, when they pay good money and share our experience, they feel betrayed and cheated.",denair1
30,Queen Mary Paranormal Tour,"I have mixed feelings on this. On one hand, being on the historic old ship and staying overnight was pretty interesting.On the other, I was disappointed by the tour especially considering the price ($50). I also as someone else mentioned didn't expect a ghost to come stand infront of us, but I also could have done without 15-20 minutes at a time sitting in the dark waiting to be ""contacted"". Our host was an older man, not Erika Frost. He said he's not a psychic but is ""sensitive"". He did not have those ghost rods that some mention but someone in the group had them. They spun around and did their thing but what if that guest did not have them? We wouldn't have anything. We did see many interesting rooms (in the dark mostly) and heard great historical trivia. The group had about 25 and it was hard to not get distracted by other guests. I think $30 would be worth this trip but for $50 I would have expected a more serious approach to the supernatural exploring realm. Or at least throw in a snack. We walked the equivelant of 17 flights of stairs, our guide said. The tour finished in just enough time to run to the Cafe and have a really late dinner. I think we should have cut back on the time spent sitting in the dark and used that to explore even more areas of the ship.The ship itself yes is old but it's supposed to be...it IS old! I wasn't expecting the luxury of the Titanic movie or anything so I was fine with it. The ""family room"" we stayed in was bigger than I expected and pretty clean.",CaliChicano
10,Don't bother,"Coming from England and loving everything about America, we were really surprised how poor this was.We always say how well the Americans do their audio tours as we have been on so many in the past but this a complete waste of money. The tour is very difficult to follow, we got lost and frustrated several times. The ship is in a tatty state and it is really not worth the money to visit her.We did not see any of the cabins and were only able to glance over a barrier into some of the larger state rooms. We saw none of the hotel (or at least I hope we didn't) so I can't comment on what it might be like to stay here.We stayed in Long Beach for a couple of days at the end of our holiday partly because of this attraction but we wished we hadn't bothered.Why don't the owners do something with this, perhaps along the lines of the fantastic Williamsburg attraction with people dressed in historic clothes and give the punters something interesting to see?",Buddy3567
50,Glad We Went,"I had done my homework and read some of the reviews here and was a bit apprehensive about continuing with our plans to stay aboard the Queen Mary for 3 days and 2 nights. I'm glad I went ahead and took the risk.From the moment we entered the ship until we left we were greeted and assisted by friendly staff who went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant. Thank you to our desk clerk, Michael, who took care of every detail with a genuine smile and friendly conversation. For those who experienced rude staff I can only assume that perhaps the guest's attitude generates the appropriate response as the more friendly and relaxed we were with the staff, the better our interaction with them became.For those who commented that the ship is old and musty I say, YES, she is old, and musty, and has seen better days, but people, she is over 75 years old and much of what you see is original! If you want 5-star modern, pristine accommodations (which lack history) you don't seek a location nearly a century old!We were thrilled to find our stateroom completely clad in the original woodwork and fixtures...what a treat it was to sit at the maple vanity in a first class stateroom and wonder who had sat in that very spot and applied their make up before heading to dinner and dancing... we had two portholes that opened to the harbor and allowed the breeze to fill the room. We explored the underside of each and every drawer and although we didn't find any inscriptions from the war era, we did find several others from decades past. We danced the waltz in the Queen's Salon, and explored to the very bottom of the belly of the ship! If you have any walking limitations, you may not be able to explore as extensively...never have we climbed so many stairs !!! ( we are in our early 40's and nearly wore ourselves out exploring every inch of the ship)We strolled the promenade and sun decks in the footsteps of royalty and the stars of the silver screen...imagining what it must have been like to sail on her in her day. If you lack the imagination to take a step back in time, perhaps this ship is not the best place for you to stay!We dined at the Promenade Cafe and everything we ordered was delicious, well prepared and affordable. The wait staff was friendly and assisted with specific requests for our dining limitations.We participated in the Ghosts and Legends Tour. For those of you who expected the tour to be authentic and posted negative comments, you robbed yourself of a fun time. Of course it's not real, and the tour guides are a bit over the top, but it's all in the spirit of having a good time. Our guide, Paul, was the best...he made the tour and we thoroughly enjoyed his spooky demeanor ... if you focus on the history and not so much on what you're ""not"" getting, you'll enjoy yourself! Our admittance was included in the hotel package, so we were pleased with the price. However, on it's own, I can see where your tourism money might be better spent. The tour lasts approximately 20 to 30 minutes, so $20+ dollars is a bit steep. However, we had a hotel package for $24 which included the Ghost tour as well as a trip to the Aquarium of the Pacific.There is much to explore, much history to take in, and plenty of opportunity to relax. If I had anything negative to say, it would be that the management of Queen Mary have sold out to the masses by installing some more modern items in the staterooms...the larger screen television took away from the overall charm of the room..I could have done without it.I am happy that I can add this trip to my scrapbook...and would recommend staying on the Queen Mary only for those who love locations steeped in history and can appreciate it as such!",jimzgrl
20,Tatty,"I visited this ship about 20 years ago and it has seriously gone downhill since then. I went again in March 2010 and it was quite quiet. No Spruce Goose of course. That went to Oregon in 1991. The whole ship looks very run down. I took the included audio tour which was ok but instructions on how to move from one place to another were confusing and its very easy to get lost. There are of course lots of shops selling all kinds of stuff. The engine room was closed on my visit because they were setting up for a movie. No refund of course. Before you pay your money (about $25) enquire about what is open and what is closed. You can do the audio tour in an hour to 90 minutes. The biggest shock was the parking. There are no signs indicating the cost. You take a ticket on your way in, park and then pay to exit. Just under 2 hours parking cost $12 !!. Add that to your ticket price to get a better view of the cost of this place. It seems so run down that its rather a pity that they don't just break it up and put it out of its misery. Not really worth a diversion in its present condition.",Glasgow111
10,Don't waste your money!,"We visited the Queen Mary last week and were totally disappointed. Our basic admittance charge of $24.95 entitled us to a 'ghost' tour - 2 men seemingly chosen for their weird looks and unintelligable voices, led us in the semi dark around the swimming pool, the boiler room and several passages. It might have been quite interesting to see these in the light but as it was it was a complete waste of time. It became apparent that we had paid for the privilege of shopping and walking the decks. To see what would have been really interesting, the first class lounge, a state room etc you had to pay extra.What was really sad was the state Queen Mary was in, no wonder that Cunard had deflagged her. I only wished that we could take the union jack down too.",alisonheff
50,First time I have seen an ocean liner,We went to the queen mary during spring break 2006. It was a first time that I had ever seen an ocean liner for real. We went on board and had a wander round the decks and other areas. We did not take any tours at all. There was not much going on at the time we were here. We admired the views as well as getting fridgemagnets from the shop.,trainfan01
40,A piece of history worth seeing,"I was skeptical about visiting the Queen Mary, but did anyways and was not disappointed. I thought it was interesting to learn about it's history during the world war II. The staff on the ship were friendly and eager to answer questions, especially the four older gentlemen at the radio communications office.",magydoll
50,True Paranormal,"Ok...the Ghosts and Legends tour is for enertainment, people. Just for fun. Out guide, Dustin, was very enertaining. For true paranormal experiences, you need to have your recorders and equipment ready and the best time is after 8 or 9 whene mpst people are in their rooms and the noise has gone away from guests walking about. i can guarantee you will get EVPs without even having to try hard. Fortunately, we have a friend that was able to tell us the true stories of the ship. Of course, the ship is a little run down, it is OLD...used as a luxury liner AND during World War-II. The history, alone, is well worth the trip. We spent the night and had a gret time. Restaurants on board are a bit expensive but there are places nearby to eat.",JustMe_78_2010
40,Queen Mary has so much history to it,We visited the Queen Mary this summer. It was a pleasant way to spend the day. We went on the walking tour and learned so much history that is associated with this ship. Our guide was very knowlegable and shared much information with us during our time there. Later we checked out head phones and took a self guided tour around the rest of the ship.,drivendbuslk
50,Great homeschooling experience,"Very fun and very educational, a real period piece that is well worth the money.",grrrbo
30,"It's OK to visit but not a high point. Read this about PARKING, though. . .","I did not mind the Queen Mary like some of the other reviewers whose comments I just read; I thought it was pleasant enough just to go browse around, but I would not pay for the ghost tour because - even though I am interested in paranormal stuff - it was just way too expensive and I knew it was not going to be legitimate for a cost like that. You would be paying for ""reputation"", not actual experiences. It's a good old ship, nice to walk around and see the general ambience, but nothing for which you should be shelling out hundreds of dollars. BY THE WAY, I saw many complaints about the parking fee. You can park much cheaper up town somewhere and then ride the city bus, one of the red colored ones, for FREE. They run till midnight and will take you to the Queen Mary and then back to the city all day and evening long, FOR FREE. So you don't need to worry about a parking fee at all!!!!!!",Mary6Ellen
10,The Ghost and Legend Tour is Worthless,"Don't waste your time or your money on this ""ghost"" experience. We weren't expecting to see ghosts, but on the other hand, we weren't expecting to be treated like idiots. I would do anyway with the ""experience"" and simply have a costumed performer point out areas. I didn't need the fake blinking lights and deadpan stupidity of the guides.",tessar508
40,An enjoyable few hours aboard!,"We had a hire car and drove to Long Beach and found the Queen Mary easy enough. We got there early, parked but didn't realise there was a parking fee ($12) until we were leaving. There were only a few visitors in the queue but it took well over 30 minutes to get our tickets ... only 1 window open and it was very slow processing. We decided on the basic, self-guided audio tour. It was a little confusing trying to find the marked numbers sometimes but at least the audio player was user-friendly until you caught up. Having said that, our few hours exploring onboard were delightful. There was much to see and it was easy to get swept up in the nostalgia. We had morning tea on the deck in the sun overlooking Long Beach .... we imagined what it must've been like to sail on her. The cafe staff were friendly and the food and prices were fine. Later we had a drink in the bar ... same nostalgic feeling. The Queen Mary is a little run down in parts but afterall, she's old and been through a lot and that's what you go to see her for, isn't it? If you want nice, new trimmings then this isn't for you, but if you want the feel and romance of yesteryear then the Queen Mary welcomes you! We would recommend a tour of the Queen Mary.",ForeverYoung50
40,Not Handicap friendly - but an EXCELLENT adventure!,A gem of a day. If you can - take the FREE shuttle from town so you don't have to spend the $12 parking. We went for the First Class - behind the scene tour and it added on to all the knowledge that you learn during the day. You can venture all over the ship and it is a fun day! LOTS of walking and steps!! They give you head phones to hear different tidbits at different spots. GREAT LOCATION and a wonderful day,masterofdaisy
10,Sunday Brunch at the Queen Mary - not enough bang for the buck,"I thought I would plan a special mother daughter day and take my mother to the Queen Mary for Sunday Brunch. For approx $40 per person plus parking, it left a lot to be desired. I get better food at other buffets for less than a quarter of price. The place was so run down, the carpet was so dirty, it looks likes it's never been washed, overall dining room and restrooms were so dingy and worn down, I didn't even let my mom go the restroom to avoid further disappointment. While the staff was nice and attentive, it still doesn't make up for the $40 cost. I am not a cheapskate, I don't mind paying even more, but I expect a nice clean place with good food, this is not one of these places. This place needs a lot of TLC, unless they invest a good deal of $$$ to spuce it up and renovate. I would not spend my time or money going back and I'm telling everyone how I feel about it.",LAExplorer69
20,Directions to which tour????,"We arrived at the Queen Mary to do the Ghosts and Legends Tour, we gave up a day at Knotts Berry Farm to go to the QM instead. Big mistake. Firstly we were told to join the ghost tour in the engine room at 11.15am. We waited for a while and wondered why noone was waiting there. We went back and asked the lady collecting the ticket stubs where the same tour started she said in the theatre room, so we went in there, noone was there. It was then 11.20am, the next tour didn't start till 1.15pm. We went outside again to ask where the tour started from and were told to walk to the other side of the ship and join at the Ghost & Legends passage way. Its strange, because we asked about that passageway in the first place and got told it was the exit only by the lady selling the tickets who had a very bad attitude. We finally took the tour which was badly dramatised and not real life observations. If you want entertainment, then go here, if you want to experience you own paranormal feelings, go some place else. The ship badly run down and in need of repair. Knotts Berry Farm would have been a better choice.",Westward Adventures
40,Longest resident,"When the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was in operation in the 1990's Several of my fellow government employees and myself were residents of the ""Queen"" for over ninety (90) days while we worked down the street at the navy yard. Coming from the east coast; we were thrilled to be able to stay aboard such a splendid ship. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were cozy and comfortable. The food from all the different restaurants on board was great (we hardly left the ship to eat!) Their Sunday brunch was popular with the locals as well. One of the nicest places I have stayed. Hope they are still around when I come back.",rockinron56
20,Not so hot....,"As a day trip/tour, the Queen leaves much to be desired. The self-tour was badly marked, sparse...and when we finally found someone who might have some information about which way to go we were greeted with a less-than-friendly attitude, as if we were imposing. This ""self-tour"" was ""free"" to Californians, and worth every penny (and less!). And it wasn't exactly free: the parking ($12) was ridiculous....the same as at Disneyland (where at least you get something for your money). If you do decide to go, take the city's Passport bus.",Steve61LongBeach
10,dirty and dank,"stay ed over night for husband'a christmas party. the only good thing i can say is that his company paid for the room. the room was dank, and dirty. the bathtub faucet had been leeking for so long there was a stain in the tub. the furiture and room seemed like a BAD motel 6 from 1967.i understand wanting to keep a historical feel to the room, however historical does not equate dirty.... so glad that i brought flip flops!do not stay at this over priced hotel in need of a major re-do. if you do, you will not be happy.",momofkkidsSanDiego
50,What really happens there,"We stayed at the Queen Mary on the 2nd of January. We arrived quite late in long beach so it was about eight p.m. when we got onto the Queen Mary. The concierge at the desk was helpful and humorous and informed us that some ghost experts had just been on the boat for six days but found nothing this year. He said they come every year to test for spirits. There was a ghost tour leaving from the Lobby Bar just as we arrived but we wanted to put our things away and eat dinner. We should have taken the tour. The subjects of the tour came to visit us later anyway. Well, we decided to stay on the boat for dinner since the view was nice so we went to the Promenade Cafe. After a nice dinner we went to the Observation Bar for a drink. The bar was beautiful and there was a lively band playing covers of Tom Petty songs. There was a group of dancers cutting a rug and groups of smokers outside, enjoying a brisk evening. After about an hour we got tired so we went back to the room. I was a bit thirsty so I got a class of water. I drank a sip, then set it on the bedside table. We slept soundly that night having driven all the way from Phoenix that day and touring around Hollywood earlier that evening. I woke up feeling refreshed the next morning and I reached for my cup of water from the night before. When I picked it up it had no water left in it! I checked underneath the cup for a spill or a leak but there was none. Someone or something had come into our room and finished my cup of water. After quickly getting dressed I left the room. Upon check-out the concierge informed me that she too had been followed one night by a ghost. This put my mind at ease after I realized the ghost in room A29 was just a thirsty ghost, not a naughty ghost.",Dannyonlinewhere
10,Thin walls and glass on our bed!,"My husband and I stayed here three nights for a seminar and shortly after checking in I sat down on the bed only to feel a sharp pain stabbing into my hand. I looked down horrified to find a piece of glass stuck in the palm of my hand and blood everywhere. We called the front desk and they sent a security guard with a first aid kit who only put a band-aid and some cheap neosporin on the wound, when it really needed to be wrapped up tightly. We found more glass on the floor - I have no idea how glass would get on a bed that was already made and supposed to have clean sheets on it - so they ended up moving us up a floor. The room was a tiny bit bigger, but was in a very noisy location. The walls are paper thin and I am not lying! We could hear every conversation and movement of the people on either side of us and were woke up several times every night and very early in the morning (around 6am). It was impossible to get a good night's rest with the walls so thin. The food at the Cafe Promenade (or whatever it was called) was okay, but horribly overpriced. Leave the ship if you want to eat and walk down to ""The Reef"" restaurant - amazing food and about the same price as the Queen Mary, if not less.As for the glass incident, the only money off they would give us on the bill was $80. Considering it costs $10/day to park there even when you're a guest, we only got $30 worth of free parking and a $50 credit to the room. Considering it's two weeks later and I still can't lean on my hand properly from the glass, I think we deserved at least one night comp'd.If we ever go to another seminar here we will stay off the property and drive in.",oceanprincess428
30,Overrated,"I stayed at this property last Oct 31. I'm so glad I got a cheap rate of$99.00 per night because the hotel is very outdated, I know it's historical and they want to preserved some old factors of the ship but it is ridiculous. Our room is very small, not to mention the toilet won't flush properly, I think it's just grossed and not well maintained. We went to the ""The Vamp"" burlesque show, the entrance is just a minimal fee but the food and drinks are expensive. It's funny that they even require you to have minimum of two drinks to order. The show was almost done and we havent finish the appetizer and our drinks we order and the waitress our already rushing us to finish everything because the show will be over and they are closing. People are there to relax and unwind.. we pay for admission so whats the big deal if we wanna stay longer to finish our food. Guess what I have to wrap my cheese and crackers in a napkin and take it to our room. It's just poor service. We are supposed to stay 2 nights we end up checking out early. My mom was here for vacation and I thought bringing her to Queen Mary will make a difference and will bring a lot of fun but definitely wrong choice. This hotel is waste of money if it's $20.00 per night go ahead book it, beyond that it's a waste of money and time.",carfave
10,Overpriced Shopping Complex,"We travelled to the Queen Mary expecting a similar experience to the USS Midway (in San Diego)- a general walking tour around the ship.Overall, the boat is shabby and rundown, both internally and externally. Fixtures (e.g. wall coverings, powerpoints, switches etc) are in extremely poor condition (broken, cracked etc). It is clear NO money has been spent on upkeep of the boat.Parking is $12.00 (NOT included in Ticket Price, and nowhere else to park).The boat is divided into several segments- the bow (front), comprising the ghost tour, the middle, comprising the hotel (inaccessible to non-guests), and the aft (rear) comprising shops, restaurants and function rooms (inaccessible to non-guests).The ghost tour is designed as a bit of fun for tourists. Sadly sites such as the indoor first-class swimming pool can only be seen on this tour. It is empty, poorly lit with plastic baricades around the edges. This should have been part of the general audio tour, where it would have been the highlight, rather than relegated to a sideshow. However, the tour guides were active in trying to excite their audience with a limited amount of material they were permitted to show.The self-guided 'tour' can only be described as access to about 10 overpriced shops (e.g. postcards $2.25 each, compared to approx $0.50 in most other tourist locations) on one level, with a bar and a restaurant (formal eveningwear required). There were only two other accessible areas- a dimly lit, poorly presented collection about the size of a 50m swimming pool with a set of first, second and third class beds, and few assorted quotations with glowing references to the Queen Mary exhibit, and the second was 3 officers quarters on the bridge. Other areas (such as rooms where passengers would have stayed, smoking rooms, dining rooms, lounge rooms, saunas etc) have either been converted into inaccessible function rooms, inaccessible guest bedrooms for the hotel or gutted for shops.The extras included in the 'First Class Passage' ticket were a tour of a Russian Submarine (see seperate article), and a 'Behind the Scenes' tour. This tour comprised of a walk through the current day shops describing their original function, a visit to a first-class lounge, and a visit to a suite (if one is available).",jchowland
10,Horrible customer service,"I took my girlfriend on a surprise birthday gift to the queen mary yesterday. About a month ago i made reservations online (http://www.queenmaryshipwreck.com/) for the breakfeast RIP backage on a saturday. the package includes a one night stay, 2 tickets to the shipwreck terrorfest, parking, and two teeshirts. Excited about the surprise, my girlfriend and i made our way to long beach and arrived around 1545. Check-ins were at four and we waited in line for about an hour until receiving our keys and vouchers. Aside from the poor customer service from arrival, the queen mary does have good history and the observation bar, proved to be the highlight of our stay. However, after trying to get into the terrorfest, which seemed to be a made up high school rave, i was told that the voucher i had was only a breakfeast voucher. i called the queen mary front desk and was told to walk back to the front desk to get my vouchers that i should have received upon check in, and then wait in line again. after arguring with the receptionist, i then found out the package i bought online, is not the package the queen mary offers. the ""manager"" spoke with me and said that there is a problem with the internet site i was on and that even though i made a reservation from that website, the queen mary did not recongnize it, but yet i was still in the system.Now irrate, i needed to be calmed down so my girlfriend and I went to the observation bar to grab some appetitzers that were supposed to be very good (girl at the front desk said they stop serving food at 1). We arrive at the bar around 11 and come to find out food is NOT being served anymore. If it wasnt for the live band and great people expressing themselves on the dance floor, i would have went back to the front desk demanding my money back.In review, its ashame the ship gets such bad reviews when its actually the people running it that makes paying tourist as i, really be hesitant about reccomending it to others. Horrible personnel, rude receptionist, false advertising, and nobody on the same page equals a review recomending that you stay clear of the queen mary and the website listed above.",azndrew3
20,Dreadful,"An appalling waste of money - this was one of the most poorly curated ""museums"" I have ever had the foolishness to spend a small forture visiting ($25 each entrance, $12 for parking - and engine room closed).The management really should be ashamed. I give it two stars only out of deference to the remarkable history of the ship. Other than that, it's not worth your time or money.",met_losangeles
10,Waste of Money,"Being an Art Deco fan, I made a point of driving to the Queen Mary to see some Art Deco splendor. I should't have bothered. It cost $24 to get in. Was then told that the engine room was closed and some of the ballrooms were out of bounds. We suggested that the entry price should be reduced but that was met with a confused look. The audio tour is awful and like others on this site, I was amazed that they couldn't find someone with a real Irish accent to narrate it. I expected the state rooms to be set up as they were during her hey day but all we saw were empty rooms. We didn't even get to look at any of the cabins. The entry fee really just gives you access to some food stalls and the cocktail bar. We nearly booked to stay at the hotel and I'm glad we didn't. The area is really isolated and not a lot around. I was also shocked that it cost $12 to park. I would not advise anyone to make a visit and I was sorely disappointed.",spflipflops
10,Avoid!!,"This is by-far the worst attraction we have visited whilst holidaying in the USA.Having paid $24 each for entry, plus $12 for car parking, we expected an interesting, well-presented tour. Instead, the attraction was poorly organised and obviously needed repair. On the day we visited all the escalators were broken, meaning visitors had to walk up steep flights of stairs to access different areas of the tour.The self-guided audio tour was poor. The actor providing the commentary had a laughable fake Irish accent - why not use an actual Irish actor?! Directions from one area of the tour to the next were very unclear and, in some cases, seemed to be incorrect. Clearer signposting from one area to the next is DEFINITELY needed!Only a very limited number of the ships areas are accessible on the tour. These mainly consisted of the decks. It would have been interesting to see the dining rooms, the galleys or some guests cabins. The engine room was also off-bounds on the day we visited.We didn't bother to stay for the ""Ghosts and Legends"" show, although other Tripadvisor reviews imply that we didn't miss much.We would certainly not recommend the Queen Mary, we thought it was very over-priced and completely under-whelming.",SFA10
40,A special feeling you get on Queen Mary,"I feel sad for Queen Mary. You can't get away from the fact that she is an old ship converted into a hotel. Unfortunately too many people forget that, and compare her with the majority of hotels that are simply blocks of concrete. Those thinking she is just an ordinary hotel should not go there. But those who want a unique experience for the night should, most definitely. We were met by enthusiastic, friendly staff. We had booked two staterooms with harbour views. With a very comfortable bed, modern TV, phone, ironing board, iron, etc the room was modestly equipped. Some of the fittings (old fan), salt water taps in the bathroom and blanked off cupboards are there to retain the character of the cabin from bygone years. The old air vents are still used, and it's nice to be able to swing out the portholes to view the harbour front. Standing in the shower is not easy as the bath (being designed for use in a rolling ship has a very curved bottom) so you have to stand with one foot in front of the other. A nuisance for some, all part of the unique experience of Queen Mary for others.Touring the ship is special, and worthy of a review on its own. Looking down the curved length of the cabin alleyway is special. Sitting, sipping a drink in the art deco bar at the front of the ship is a unique experience. Having the excellent halibut and chips in the Esplanade Restaurant was also very pleasant, and modestly priced too. And there are many other things that we think made our stay positively unique.I'm not sure how long the owners can keep the ship up to the required structural and safety standards, let alone how long they can make it a viable business. All I can say is, provided you are not entirely shallow minded, a night on Queen Mary is an experience worth having before it is too late.",pentlandpirate
10,"Horrible experience, dirty limited, and worst an insult to the military","This is a travisty. A beatiful peice of history that has been gutted and turned into a cheezy hotel and shopping mall. The self guided tour is a joke as anything of interest is off limits. What you do see is a stripped down, gutted shell of a once magnificient ship. There literally is nothing to see and you just walk up and down hallways. The map they give you is confusing and basically of no help. The ghost tour was as cheezy and insulting as it could be, They basically made entertainment out of 300 Brittish servicemen dying and pretended that their ghosts were still in the ship by using some rediculous props and blinking lights/fog machine. They should be ashamed of themselves. If one of my relatives had been one of the ones who had dyed in the crash of the Queen Mary into another navel vessel I would have been irrate. This ship has tremendous history, but you would never know it by visiting there. Stay away and read a book of the QM if interested, You will save $25 and be better off.",mackca
40,A reminder of better times,"We did enjoy our visit to the Queen Mary; the staff were friendly and chatty and there is a lot to see but it is pretty expensive not to mention the parking. We arrived at 4.40pm and expected to have an hour and a half to visit before closing; generously we were offered the ghost tour at no extra cost but didn't fancy it. In the event, we didn't leave until 7.30pm or so; as it's a hotel it doesn't close! The exhibits downstairs are quite interesting, especially the orientation movie on the history of the ship. However, elsewhere there are non-functioning televisions, empty cases and blank displays. We did follow the self-guided tour and saw everything but then went ""free range"" to see the dining rooms etc. It remains a very impressive ship and fun to explore (I think even quite young kids would love clambering all over it!) but it's in a sorry state; they are clearly working hard to do as much as they can but rust and rot is taking an obvious toll. I'd visit it whilst you still can...",flos
10,Overpriced Tour & Parking......,"Sorry that I did not read reviews on this first. It was geat to see the history of this fabulous shp, however, I do not know what the owners of the ""business"" are doing with the admission money, as it is not going back into the ship. They would be better bringing the price down and having more peope go through it for a nominal fee, then pay the $50 for two to go on board and see a lot of information that you could google and find out about 'her' anyway.True enter in the hotel entrance and you will see a good part of the ship. What the admission fee is for is the engine room - whoopee!! and the theartre a few models of ships( lights were not working so they were in the dark!!)- Disgusting waste of money- Very dissapointed.",Emeldez
50,"Fun, Fun and more Fun!!","My husband and I went to the Queen Mary for the ""Dining with the Spirits"" tour. Since we knew dinner and the tour would take awhile we also booked a room at the hotel. May I first say that the dinner and dessert at Sir Winston's was WONDERFUL!! Delicious and a great time to dine with other people who are also anxiously awaiting the ghost tour. Our tour guide, Erika Frost, was very sweet and very knowledgable of the ship's history. The ghost tour was around 3 hours long and very interactive. My husband was quite the skeptic before we took this tour and honestly he really did not even want to come. Our tour in particular was filled with spiritual activity and at one point in the tour our tour guide did state that since there was so much ghostly activity during our tour that we may experience some activity in our hotel room. My husband laughed at this thought and kept telling me ""Yeah right, spirits do not exist""... We he changed his tune later that night because our TV in our hotel room turned on and off by itself about 4 times during the night and one time the next morning. The remote was clear on the other side of the room. The next day my husband was quickly ready to check out but he actually admitted to realy enjoying this experience which is unlike any other entertainment anywhere else in Los Angeles County. If you are looking do do something different and very fun book like we did. Dinner with the Spirits is 1 of the 3 tours you can take there regarding Ghost Walks and is much more in depth and intimate than the Ghosts and Legends tours. Also you get a discount on the hotel rate if you stay the same night after your tour.. LOVED IT!!!!!",cabo_san_lucas_lover
50,a rare experience to travel back in time,"Having just returned from spending 3 nights at the Queen Mary Hotel,I can do nothing but praise the entire stay.Having read awful reviews on this hotel,I was scared to step onboard.The hotel is old but still retains it's elegant feel.The hallways with all the original woods is outstanding.No cruise ship today,could hold a candle to this stately ship.We requested a 2 room suite on the main deck,which was 2 bedrooms connected by a inner doorway.The 2nd adjoining bedroom seemed to be for servants or children only...it was nothing special at all,but we kept our luggage there.The main bedroom had the original look and feel of being on a transatlantic liner in the 30's....just what I was looking for.I understand how people complained of thin walls ,where you can hear in the cabins next door...that is unfortunately very true,however our neighbors were very quite at night,and I slept very well.The room temperature was very comfortable.Also opened the 2 portholes to let in a nice breeze.Our rooms had 9 little ventilator ports that constantly blew in cool air all over the suite.all in all a great time and I look forward to going back.The staff was wonderful and very nice to deal with...not like what was reported on the website at all.",TommyCT
50,Great Event On Board,"We hosted a party on board the Queen Mary in June for a professional association.I have to say it was wonderful, our experience with Sabine the catering manager and the rest of the staff was above par. The food was fantastic and the views amazing.They suggested we hire a jazz singer, Rita Edmond, and she was perfect for the event. We will use her again too.Our guests that stayed in the rooms had a great time too!It was the highlight of our year and hope we can come back and do it again next year.(my only suggestion, bring flats and slip on your heels once you get to the banquet room, the ship is HUGE)",MadMadge43
20,"Worth a visit, but way overpriced","The negative reviews are right on. It was better to be in prison (really -- more below). Still, the QM remains a great lady, a little worn, maybe, but fascinating. Walk the promenade deck, descend to the engine room, view the art deco details executed in fine wood and metal, and you are swept back into an age when a first-class crossing of the Atlantic was so much more than a chair that turns into a bed, and your own video screen.The problem is not the ship, but the total mismanagement of the tour, and pricing that is outrageous for what they offer. It started with an excruciatingly slow line to get tickets. Then, inadequate signs and directions left us wandering around the entrance ramps until we finally found the ticket-taker. She motioned us to what was supposed to be the start of the ""Self-guided"" tour, but there was no one to direct us there and we got lost. More wandering brought us to artifacts that offered interesting encounters with maritime history, but information about them was inadequate.For the steep admission price , there should have been a live, well-trained guide, or at least a pre-recorded audio program that provides explanations through a headset you carry. There should have been a brochure with maps, history, and key facts about the ship. More people should have been placed around the ship to offer visitors directions and explanations.Later that week we toured Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay. The price was comparable to the QM, but included a ferry ride across the bay, a free audio guide, lots of information, and a tour ""engineered"" to leave you with a real sense of what the place was like, and why you should care. Worth every penny.It didn't bother us that Alcatraz was crumbling and in disrepair. What was preserved, and the way it was explained, left us with a real understanding of what it had been.The QM is rundown, but it is being restored, slowly, and deserves to be a ""must see."" It is a living museum of a pinnacle moment in maritime history. The City of Long Beach, and dedicated supporters, deserve credit for saving this grand ship from the scrapyard, But they won't get far by charging too much for too little, and having visitors spread the word here and elsewhere.If the tour were brought up to the level of the Alcatraz experience, it would rate 5 stars. Given the sorry mess that it is, 2 is generous. As others have suggested here, if you are interested in this ship and its history, it may be a better deal to book a room for an overnight stay, than to pay for the tour.",DaddyBNY
10,A waste of time and money,"The $25 entrance fee is steep (one of the more expensive attractions we visited on our 2 week trip). We roamed around the top decks for a while trying to avoid the wasps swarming. We then looked forward to seeing something of a bit more interest - but there wasn't anything. There is pretty much no access to anything you can't see from the shore, no staterooms apart from the Captain's quarters. Whichever way we went we seemed to end up in the hotel. Our daughter was looking forward to seeing some rooms, and the swimming pool. After some desperate roaming we decided to make a last trip to the pool, but it turns out you can't go apart from on the tour, and we simply had wasted so much time we couldnt spare any more, so cut our losses and left. We made a special effort to go to long Beach just to visit the QM and although Long Beach is nice enough, we could have spent the time much more productively and enjoyably elsewhere in the LA area.Poor.",pjack68
40,Nice time on the Queen Mary,"Arrived onboard and immediately got our room. It was about 11AM !! And the room was ready. We had a nice large stateroom facing Longbeach. The room was clean, the bathroom was spacious with plenty of hot water and an excellent toilet. The bed although firm, was comfortable. We even had a mini frig in the room too, We ate onboard and found the food to be very good. This is an old ship, so it will not be like staying at a Hilton, Mariott, or Ritz Carlton.......Inspite of that, it is still a great experience if you have not gone........",Avispon
30,Great Tour,"I was surprised when we saw the Queen Mary. Initially I did ""my homework"" and looked into the information on the tours. Looked at this website for reviews and my family and I decided maybe we shouldn't waste our money on this ship. The last day in Long Beach, we wanted to at least get pictures of the outside of the ship. We went to parking and I promised myself no more than1 hour parking so that I could only pay $3.00 admission for this ""horrible ship."" We took pictures and also went to the admission booth. We decided to purchase a passport package, we went on the ghost and legends tour, self guided tour and the tour with a guide. The tour was GREAT! I had kids with me (ages: 16,14,12, &6) and they thought the Ghost and legends tour was awesome. We then took the guided tour and this was great as well, then took our own tour. Our guides were helpful and informative. My family enjoyed this trip very much. It is an old ship, but the staff was helpful and the tour was great. I think that if they fixed up the ""old"" areas of the tour it would take away from the ship's unique features. Don't update those areas, they are great.",Mainescrapbooker
10,Terrible Rip Off - Cheesy,"This is the worst attraction that I, or anyone else in my family ,has ever been to. The self guided tour is confusing and not interesting and there is no one to ask if you have a question. The haunted tour, which you pay extra for, is a joke. A few creepy and poor actors take you through fake and unimaginative situations. We got lost in the self directed tour and wound up in the hotel.Save yourself the money and enter through the hotel then take the elelevator up and you can go practically anywhere on the ship.We only went there because we had a rainy day to kill. We vacation in Southern Cal every year and this is the first thing we've ever done that made us feel that we got screwed.",frozenuphere
10,Terrible Experience,"Believe all the negative reviews you see of the Queen Mary tour. They are all right on; the ship is filthy and in terrible disrepair - it's depressing to see in the condition it's in. Repress the desire to see a ""Titanic surrogate"" - the current condition of the ship, its decks and finishes will only increase the longing, not sate it. I think you will actually be better off to imagine what the interior of the ship looks like compared to seeing the reality of worn carpets, leaking portholes and drains, and touristy shops.We had the misfortune to be there on a day when it poured rain, so the upper decks were not terribly accessible due to weather, but seeing those decks would not have enhanced the experience. The exhibits are uninformative and very skip-able. If you must see this ship, heed the advice of other reviewers and don't pay admission for the self-tour - simply enter through the hotel entrance toward the bow of the ship and walk back toward the stern. The specific tour exhibits are boring, old, and not worth the $22.95 per person admission. Parking will cost $15.00, so paying admission for the self tour for two plus parking comes to over $60.00!",jim914109
10,Expensive and uninformative,"After reading in the Michelin Green Guide to California that the Queen Mary received 3 stars, we were curious to tour this once grand ocean liner now docked in Long Beach. In January 2008, my friends and I each paid the single admission of $19.95 to a surly attendant and then were more or less left to wander about the QM with only the most rudimentary of maps to guide us. We stumbled upon a few brief signs and eventually found ourselves in the ship's tacky hotel lobby. With the exception of the art deco cocktail lounge, the most interesting and worthwhile interior spaces of the ship were all off limits to the tour, the doors were locked. We all left feeling very disappointed that we had not been able to see the few remaining grand interior spaces the ship was famous for and that we learned practically nothing substantive about the history of the Queen Mary. Our frustration was only increased when we were charged $15 for parking the 2 hours on board the ship. If after reading this you feel compelled to walk the dark corridors of the Queen Mary, save yourself at least the inflated admission fee and simply enter the ship via the front door to the hotel.",CosmoTopper
10,It Might be Better Perserved Under Water,"The expensive general admission price gets you very little access to the ship. (Add another $15 for parking.) Both the Queen's Salon and the Royal Salon were off limits. In fact, anything worth seeing was off limits unless you could arrange, at an additional price, access to some of the more interesting areas. There is no attempt by current management to make a visit interesting for the general admission ticket. The self-guided tour map provides absolutely no information. Basically, you just wander around aimlessly. For example, there are instructions on the bridge describing the steps the crew follows to fill the swimming pools. If there is a swimming pool on this boat, it is hidden in a closet--never did find it.All the previous comments about the dirty condition are true and I need not belabor that point.It was really depressing to see that many of the beautiful art deco lounges had been striped of their original decoration to make way for clap-trap and t-shirt shops. How can anyone do this to one of the few surviving examples of this glorious era?If you must go, try using the hotel entrance to avoid the pricey entrance fee.",Bothercollie
10,"Creepy,a real disappointment","Badly in need of funds, the lack of upkeep is evident. Place is creepy and dirty. Not enough exhibit of the ship in it's heyday. Ballrooms were dirty and empty. The only good thing was the Ghosts and Legends Tour guide named Ben who gave it his all and was very entertaining. Otherwise, the rest of the tour was extremely disappointing. Don't bother to pay extra for the Haunted Encounters Tour. Very boring and redundant. Our guide seemed like she just couldn't wait to end her workday. I would not recommend seeing the Queen Mary to anyone. I would not be surprised if it went bankrupt in the very near future.",LanigirlHB
50,"This was fun and educational, not for little kids...","We Loved it !!!!Trip AdvisorQueen Mary Hotel[--]We arrived around noon, and decided to take the First Class Passage tour of the Q.M. It included the following:•The Incredible World of Spy-Fi, Ghosts & Legends of the Queen Mary, Self-Guided Queen Mary Ship walk Tour, A Short Submarine Film, Self-Guided Tour Aboard the Russian Cold War-era Submarine Scorpion, Behind-the-Scenes or World War II Guided Tour ,Sun Deck Gallery Exhibit: Woman: A Celebration.We paid for each Adult: $29.95. (Other Prices for Senior (55+)/Military: $26.95, Child (5-11): $18.95.)We had coffee and a muffin (pre-packaged) and spent $7.00 for that little snack. There are other places to eat on boar with better pricing, so look around before committing. We enjoyed it. It was a lot of walking, and not crowded at all. The lower level hosted a very educational display of photos, ship models, posters, etc. There is lots of reading and we would not recommend this for the little kids.We walked through the World War II area, and more pictures and reading, and very cool displays.The Guided Tour was neat, as it was to areas not open to the General Public. We even visited the Churchill suite.The Spy Fi area was small, but hosted a wide range of movie spy memorabilia, props, scripts, contracts, photos, and the like. Think Austin Powers, Get Smart, Wild Wild West, James Bond, etc.The promenade was a nice walk. They have a wedding area, a few food places and a great view over looking the skyline of L.B.My husband enjoyed the Captains Quarters, the Bridge, and Deck areas, as well as the Art Deco Bar/Lounge.After that we did some shopping at the boutiques on board and then headed to the Ghosts & Legends of the Queen Mary. This was more than we expected. It is set up with special effects, sounds, screams, lights, etc. You travel to the deep hull of the ship and see the area that was repaired after a collision. And where the original swimming pool is… This was a lot of fun, kind of hoakie, but we enjoyed it!Our review of the trip was 5. We are aware of the ships history, and that it is not a NEW attraction. We accepted the various smells, and the dated décor. It was educational and entertaining.Beware: Parking is $10.00 for the day Check the website for great deals Ocean Adventure Hotel Package.Treat your family to this complete ocean exploration, all for one small price.

10,Not the Experience we expected!,"Lets just say we had not expected a five star experience.. But this was a nightmare.. As we sat and dined we were much surprised how dirty and run down the shape of the restuarant. The staff seemed at best indifferent to us and our needs. To make matters worse we were disgusted to see rodents dash and run past our table, when we spoke with one of the staff they apologized and said it is an old ship and I asked if they discussed this with management and they said yes but they have done nothing... not what I was expecting..I had heard they had new management and ask to speak with the General Manager only to be informed that he was away, I asked how long he was away for and no one knew.How room was not any better as it was dirty, the small tv which was fuzzy and unable to watch. The bedding was filthy and the carpeting looked as if it had not been cleaned as well..Not what I was expecting..The bar which was suppose to be the jewel of the ship as it had been recently worked on,but I am surprised the bar itself was flithy and dirty, my drinks had to be placed in plastic cups because the staff had no glasses..The Queen Mary is not the experience we had expected..To be honest it was a rip off !",Hippiquepix
30,Ghost Tour of the Queen Mary,"I took my mother to the Queen Mary on the Ghosts and Legends tour with psychic Peter James for her birthday. When we arrived at the room that I had booked for us to stay in over night, we found that the air-conditioning wasn't working. After the staff sent the maintanence man to our room to see if he could fix it, and they found out they couldn't, they switched us to a better and bigger stateroom that was in working order.The tour with Peter James was behind the scenes with a group of about 20 of us. The price was very reasonable for the length of the tour and the amount of information he gave us about the history of the ship, as well as where different areas were thought to have paranormal activity.My mother and I enjoyed the tour and was surprised to see that it even went an hour beyond the scheduled ending time. That's how much we were all enjoying ourselves.After the tour, the group sat down to a fantastic meal in one of the restaurants on board with Peter James. It was a lovely end to a great evening.If you were to ask me if I'd do it again, I'd say in a heartbeat!",baskininthesun
20,A Lot Has Changed,"I'd been to The Queen Mary on more than three separate occasions before my most recent visit. My last visit, before this year's return, was in 2005. I have to say, quite a few things have changed. For instance, I couldn't find the soldiers museum area with the nursery and the gym anywhere. I've been there many times. When I walked past the entrance this go around, a sign read ""Office Personnel Only."" I guess they did away with this valuable part of the self-tour and turned it into office space.As for the attitude of the staff, things were better this go around. You can tell the Hotel is under new management. However, I wouldn't say I necessarily agree with the new direction. This go around, there were more 'night clubs' than ever, more 'displays' than ever, and 'more noise' than ever. The history of the ship, which is the quality that always won me over, is slowly being replaced by 'wanna-be trendy' night clubs and extra office space. Pretty soon they'll have an amusement park in the adjacent parking lot.Overall, the place was a bit cleaner than during my last visit. No empty soda cans floating in the water around the ship. And the wait staff at The Promenade Cafe were a bit better than last go around. My only gripe was the bathroom in my stateroom. It was clean, but corners and edges were beginning to show signs of mildew, etc. Definitely not a pretty sight. This is not due to lack of cleaning. It's due to the materials getting old and not being replaced.I opted for The Chelsea for dinner during my Saturday night stay. They recommend reservations, but the place was pretty empty. Walked right in wearing jeans and a sweat shirt. Food wasn't that great, but the service was amazing. Top quality to say the least.Overall, I enjoyed my stay (once again in an A Deck stateroom). However, I'm disappointed to see management focusing so much on new attractions while the true 'history' of the ship pays the price. There's no doubt, parts of the ship need some major TLC. Unfortunately, buckled flooring and rotting wood are commonplace, as nightclubs and pay-per-admission venues seem to be popping up everywhere.It seems to me, it would be a much more appealing experience if the owners focused on the history of the ship by recreating original floor plans, restoring aging materials, and, in essence, restoring the natural beauty that once made this ship one of the finest cruise liners in the world.",JPLEdit
20,Oh Dear - Not a Happy Ship,"We stayed on QM 16 years ago when we visited CA on our honeymoon. We stayed again for one night with our kids (aged 4 and 8) on our holiday this year and wished we hadn't bothered.As a ship, the QM is impressive, although its general appearance is now poor and it feels very unloved. We had a room with a 'family package' which included the tour of the ship, a tour of the russian submarine next door, a movie in the room, a pizza and breakfast for 4.We arrived well before check-in time and were offered a room facing land, so we opted to hang on until later for a room facing water. We were told at this point that the hotel movie system wasn't working so we weren't going to be able to watch a film that evening - disappointing, but not the end of the world. We were told that we could claim our pizza from the deli on the sun-deck. So we went a booked into a tour of the ship which was led by an apparently genuine retired officer type. The tour was interesting, although we picked a few holes in his dates relating to the Royal Family!We went back to reception (the only one in the USA where you can wait patiently for a member of staff, only for some impatient wotsit to push in and the staff let them. I did say something when it happened twice, but it didn't make much difference!) and got our room keys. The rooms, possibly other that the original first-class suites, are dark and very dated and at least one light bulb was not working. They certainly weren't up to the standard you would expect for the price. No room service menu and no information about the hotel, or the ship itself.The submarine tour (self-guided) was vaguely interesting. Lets face it, unless you have a particular interest a tube full of pipes and wires is not exactly scintillating, is it?We wandered up to the sun-deck deli (this is a very long ship, so getting around takes time!) to discover at 5.55pm that the deli closed at 6pm. I visited reception to point out that eating a pizza in a restauant was one thing, eating one in our room without a movie was something else. They tried a little sympathy (didn't work) and then 'discovered' that the film system was working after all. So, in the end, we had a pizza through room service (which was pretty good) and watched a current film with the kids - which is what we had intended to do all along.In the morning we went for breakfast in the Promenade Cafe. The menu for the inclusive breakfast is fixed. The choices, and the food, were OK, but the children also had to eat off that menu. There were kids choices on the a la carte (at less money than the fixed price) but we would have had to pay extra for the kids to have those... I couldn't be bothered to argue at that point, so we made the best of what we wanted.When we booked out, I jumped the queue. Guess what - nobody said a word!Would I recommend this place as a hotel? - No. Unless perhaps you were attending a function on board and could get a sensible room rate. As an attraction? Not unless you have a desire to see a 1930's cruise liner looking tatty and tired.We could have spent our time and money to much better effect elsewhere in the area - and wish we had.",HarrysMum2
10,Worst place I've been.,Personell are border line rude and unco-operative. If you are handicapped you cannot view entire tour so I did not see it all.Waste of money.,ocbritt
10,Needs better management,"The Queen Mary is absolutely a historial treasure that must be preserved. However, it is currently managed by people who don't really understand the jewel they've got. I believe the City of Long Beach should have a frank discussion with the City of San Diego to discuss the possibility of moving the Queen Mary alongside the USS Midway and San Diego Maritime Museum. (More on that later).We arrived at 10:30 a.m. on a Wednesday in July. Our first clue that something might be amiss was the very fact that hardly anyone was there. When we arrived at the lone ticket booth, there were six or so people ahead of us, and it took forever to purchase tickets. For $29.99 per person, we had to choose between the 'Behind the Scenes"" tour or the ""World War II"" tour. Why we couldn't do both was the first mystery.Once we had our tickets in hand, we proceded to the ship. With my 70+-year-old mother along, we naturally looked for elevators. There were none at that part of the ship. The ticket-taker vaguely pointed towards the ""hotel"" section at the opposite end of the ship and said there were elevators in that direction. So, faced with a super-long walk or stairs, my mother opted for stairs. There also were escalators, but they were not operating that day. Once we entered the ship, we were pretty much on our own to poke around and explore. So we did. We basically had the ship to ourselves.Things were not well-marked at all. Now let me contrast this with the USS Midway, which provides each visitor with a headset. All you do is plug in the number on the exhibit, and you get lots of great information. The Japanese-American History Museum in Los Angeles has a system that utilizes one's own cell phone. That was the frustrating part of the Queen Mary – knowing there was so much great information, lore and personal recollections out there, and we were never going to hear about it.We did get the ""Behind The Scenes"" tour at the appointed time we had to request when we arrived. It lasted about an hour, and it had the kind of information we were looking for, but it was only one small section of the ship — the Promenade Deck. It was better than nothing, but it wasn't nearly enough.My son and sister did the ""Ghosts and Legends"" tour. There was no ADA access to get to it. My mom and I opted to cool our heels in the bar — which is a gorgeous place. The art deco interior is not to be missed. If you go, spend some time there looking around — no one will be able to provide you information about it, but just enjoy. Afterwards, my son and sister came back and said the ghost tour was ""enhanced"" with some cheesy special effects. Bummer. With the history the ship has, why muck it up? If it is truly haunted, why not let the chips fall where they may?We did the ""Spy-Fi"" tour, as well. What movie props from tv/movie spy films had to do with the Queen Mary, I'll never know. It was an interesting exhibit, and I was thrilled to see the Get Smart shoe phone, but it didn't really fit with the overall theme of things. it seemed like hodge-podge slapped on to try to boost attendance.We had lunch at the deli, and our sandwiches were good. Sitting out under the rusting lifeboats wasn't bad, either. Nice view of Long Beach.We came across non-working elevators inside the ship, so in many places, we had to use stairs. If there were alternatives, they were not marked. By this time, with all of the scampering up and down stairs and such, it was time to go home. We missed the engine room completely because it was on the other end of the ship, and people were tired and ready to leave. The USS Midway came up with solutions to getting people with ambulatory challenges through their ship. They have mounted elevators on the outside of the ship that go to the different decks. They also offer an video alternative for those who cannot physically clamber around the parts of the ship in which elevators are not feasible, such as the quarters, brig, engine room, etc. If this can be done on an aircraft carrier, there is no reason why it can't be done on the Queen Mary.We did do the shops on board, and we found the staff to be ""indifferent"" at best. Shops mysteriously closed in the middle of the day, so you never knew what would be open when. And one shop that said it would re-open at 2 p.m. never did.Between the ship and the parking lot, there are a series of shops that were either empty or closed that day. If the Queen Mary is having difficulties in the middle of July, I have to wonder.The final insult was having to pay an additional $10 to leave the parking lot. Ridiculous.As far as the hotel portion, we got a peek into one of the suites during the ""Behind The Scenes"" tour. Personally, I'd go elsewhere less cramped and with better appointed bathrooms.So it seems to me that the Queen Mary must be making money mainly through the hotel, conference rooms, night clubs and — parking fees. There were several night clubs advertised, including one called ""Vamp,"" which probably isn't very family friendly. A few weeks ago, there was a gang shooting in the parking lot, which didn't surprise me.The history and art preservation definitely takes a back seat here, which is very sad. That is why I think the Queen Mary should be moved elsewhere — preferably to San Diego, where they already know how to do this so well. Think of it: there would already be a captive audience - visitors who are more interested in maritime history than cheesy tours or night clubs.They also need to cut the admission price by at least half. Three of us (two adults and a child) got into the USS Midway for about $36, and it was well worth it.",PWestcomm
40,Great nightlife! Beautiful ship!,"If you're looking for a truly unique nightlife experience with the feeling of being aboard a classic cruise ship, the Queen Mary is the best! The art deco interior designs add to the ambiance that you've stepped back in time to the golden era of cruising. You can almost FEEL all the history that went on on this ship, all the good times.They also have a Reggae Happy hour on Friday nights that's a lot of fun. Parking is free if you go to the bar. Try the Ketel One martinis at the Observation bar, they're excellent!",judodude
20,A n ice place to visit but I wouldn't want to stay there.,"While on vacation in the LA area, I wanted to take the Ghost Tour of the Queen Mary. The ship is extremely impressive and rich in history.The tour guide was lackluster at best....Rushing us from one area of the ship to another. She had no inflection in her voice and she seemed completely bored with the whole thng.It took you to areas of the ship that are offlimits to the public. That was really cool. However, when the tour ended, they took us to a ""suite"" on the ship to see what one looked like if we ever wished to book a stay. Honestly, the rooms were pretty scary looking. It's not the fact that they are completely original...It's the fact that the 'modern' things (bedding, TVs, etc.) looked horrid!The headboard in the ""suite"" had peeling faux-Mahogony contact paper on it! If this was a ""suite"", I'd hate to see a regular room.",CharlieinNJ
40,Nice Day!,"We had a wonderful afternoon on the Queen Mary. It was low season, no crowds. Amazing experience to walk along the corridors of such an amazing ship. the Ghost tour was really quite good and the Titanic exhibit was extremely classy.I'd go again!",mohicans
40,Unique Experience,"If you don't like to walk, staying on the Queen Mary, with it's long corridors, may not be for you. Other than that, you will be experiencing a time of deco opulance that could not be repeated today. If you seek modernity, however, you should look elsewhere. This is a real ship of the past that carried the wealthy of the 1930's to Europe. Walls of birdsye Maple throughout. Very original in detail, down to the deco elevators. Room lighting is low, probably exactly as it was then. If you can accept a REAL piece of history that feels and is very original, give it a try. If you are expecting something austere and sterile, this is not your place. Ship-board restaurants were surprisingly good.Squirrelhead",Squirrelhead
10,Abandon Ship,"We were booked on a cruise through Carnival and decided to visit the Queen Mary prior to departure - what a mistake!You would think a ship full of so much history they would do a better job at preserving her. The ship is filthy, the carpet is stick and lifing up in places and the employees all seemed to be miserable and didn't make you feel welcome.We decided to grab a bite to eat at a deli, the Promenade Cafe. The woman working at the counter was far from friendly and very slow. They had these cute names for sandwiches like The Black Pearl and names like that. The woman working there had to look up at the menu board to figure out what she was making. It said we had options for the bread but there were no options, they were these 8"" long rolls that looked like they had all been sat on. On top of that the bread was so dry and stale. The first bite besides being dry had a bad taste it ended up being some of the meats on the sandwich, it was horrible. The prices were outrageous too, $40 for 4 sandwiches, 2 small bags of chips and 4 drinks.",DiabloDeb
10,Dirty Old Ship,"We just spent New Years Eve on the Queen Mary. If you like waiting in line for 20 minutes to get it, long lines at the bar, absolutely no where to sit in any room, then this is your place.The rooms were dirty, small and dumpy. They tell you there are 4-5 rooms to go to but forgot to mention two of the rooms are outside parties. (now we have to go back and get our coats-another 20 minute hassle) Oh did I mention $15.00 to park?I certainly don't mind paying top prices but except excellent service for this. This place/ship is LOW-CLASS.",Commemorative56
10,Ripoff! Don't go!!!!!,"My wife and I brought my parents to the Queen Mary on their recent trip to California. We had heard good things about it, but were VERY disappointed. First, the cost of admission is outrageous! For $22.00 per general admission ticket I expected MUCH more!!! It was dirty and the people who worked there (cafe, ticket booth, etc) seemed to wish they were somewhere else. This reflects very poorly on the whole experience. The attitude and food in the Hollywood Cafe was substandard (at a relatively high price). We were limited to specific areas because we only had a General Admission ticket. The best part of the visiting the Queen Mary was the ""treasures"" exhibit. Soon enough I""m sure that will be off limits to General Admission ticket holders.Save your time and money. Seriously. Don't go. I love visiting historical areas/parks/ etc. This is one that should be missed (until they reduce ticket prices to $7-10 and improve quality.",meburk2
10,Thank God we didn't stay there,"We visited the Queen Mary on our recent trip to LA. What a dump. The ship is poorly preserved and looks like it is run on a shoe string. It was dirty (I'm talking feet sticking to carpet here) and very poorly presented. We did the self guide tour which is a bit of a free for all as you just basically wander around the ship at will. The decks were dirty and the tour poorly sign posted so you didn't know if you were going in the right areas of the ship. At one point we ended up on a corridor where all the cabins were thinking it was part of the tour, we then realised that it was actually the hotel and couldn't believe it because it was totally minging!! The elevator didn't work, the restrooms were out of order, the ticket booth computer was down, the coffee machine in Starbucks (yes, not even The QM escapes Starbucks) was bust and the escalator was broken. We were attacked by pigeons when we sat on the deck having a coffee from tables that looked as though they had never been wiped. The ghost tour was quite entertaining, but totally out of keeping from the rest of the attractions on board as someone obviously thought it was necessary to turn the boiler room of this historic ship into a Universal Studio type of attraction with sound effects, lighting, fake floods etc etc... - very wierd. We were offered The QM as a base to stay in LA when we booked our holiday, after our 2 hour visit we were so glad we had decided on alternative accommodation. The whole thing is downright depressing!!",Dinolola
40,A Wonderful Walk Back in History,"I stayed from Sept 5, 2006 through Sept 8 and enjoyed my stay. For a grand lady who has seen and been part of so much history, she has a charm you won't see in the sort of plastic environs of a Hilton or Marriott. I stayed in the Royal Suite. The wood was beautiful, the fittings harkened back to the romantic by-gone and the rooms were huge. The port holes opened, so I slept very well with the fresh ocean breezes.The service was outstanding and the staff very friendly. The food, even for room service, was way above average.I took the evening Ghost Tour which is only available on Thursday and Saturday nights, and it was 3 hours of fascinating history. We did run into some unexplainable happenings and there is something very compelling about the deep bowels of this ship. Nothing was dressed up or staged and the tour guide was both charming and well-versed.I recommend this hotel highly for anyone who can appreciate the beauty of antique buildings, furniture or ships. If you want that plastic uniformity of Marriott, this probably will not appeal to you. If you have a bent for the romantic, you'll love it.",Deaun
20,Nothing paranormal here !,"Hi, after attending the Queen Mary Dinner and Ghost Tour many times at 109.00 per visit, I would like to share my comments and observations. First off the dinner at Sir Winstons is quite good, can`t go wrong there. However being I am interested in the paranormal and seeing as how the Queen Mary tour quide claims to be the resident psychic with many personnal encounters on board, I tried several visits/times to make or see contact being made. Not only does the resident psychic fail each time to produce anything but no one ever in the qroup has had anything happen. IMO, the noises and dialog are redundent if not completely prescripted. It is essentially a commercial enterprise. I do believe that there maybe some potential for a true paranormal experience, but sadly it is the bizarre claims of the so called psychic that seemed the most paranormal, I sincerely doubt the psyhics claim of authenticity. Enjoy the dinner but do not expect anything more than a peek at dilapidated areas of the ship generally not available to the public. At 109.00 a pop, I suggest your money be spent elsewhere. Try Bodie Ghost Town, that place is REALLY haunted and offers much more overall enjoyment. Thanks.",QualitySeeker
10,Sad day on the Queen,"On July 1st. we visited the Queen Mary and were extremely dissappointed, not only by the condition of the ship, but also the very limited areas we were able to visit on a General Admission ticket. We really felt rip-offed by the whole experience! We had visited this ship years ago before the City of Long Beach took it over and it was in much better condition. With the high cost of admission the City should be able to keep it painted, cleaned and in as good a condition as it was in when it sailed on the high seas. Those in our party agreed we would never recommend visiting the Queen Mary to a friend and felt even the Hotel part of it was substandard. This was not a good experiencee.",Travel26940
10,Avoid like the plague,"This was the worst tourist attraction i have ever visited. At $20+ it was a mega ripoff. We expected to see the beautiful ballrooms, art deco interiors, first class dining rooms, unique art work etc. And to get a feel of luxury first class travel in the 1930s. Instead we saw an empty promenade deck and the sun deck and a barren hospital wing The beautiful, atmospheric art work is all behind glass, or poorly displayed.The only good bits are the captain's quartwrs and the WW2 stuffA thoroughly depressing experienceif you must go, avoid the self-guided tour and explore on your own, especially the interiors and the hotel. Try to visit the hotel alone, if you can bluff your way in , not do the tourRemember to take a sick bag with you, to be ready for when they add insult to injury when they charge you a further $10 for the parking",Freedom14418
40,very interesting and unique,"a lot of history, a nice take in, you felt like you were on the Titanic as you walked down the hallway. Make sure you go in the Russian submarine next to the Queen Mary, that was excellent as well.",bostravelerBoston
50,Didn't feel at all like a tourist trap!,"During a recent vacation to LA (and as it was Monday afternoon and the museums were all closed) we decided to take the Metro down to Long Beach. This was good value in itself as the Metro ticket was only $3 each all day, although it did take quite a long time to get there.Once there, a series of free shuttle busses operate from close to the Metro stop and go to the sights of Long Beach including the Queen Mary. Again, this takes time as they seem to travel in huge loops.We arrived at the Queen Mary at 3.45 and a kindly employee pointed out that if we waited until 4pm, the entrance tickets were reduced to half price. This we did, but it meant that we had to sprint around the boat to get a good look at everything before it closed at 5pm.You could easily spend a day there. The boat has been very nicely preserved - from the engine rooms to the upper decks. There are a number of exhibits and film shows (which we didn't really get time to look at) and places to dine on the ship. Walking around, I got the feeling of an elegant, classy ship from the days gone by. It was certainly not the usual tourist trap.We will certainly go back there again and may even try the hotel next time.",92075
50,One of the Best Brunches,"Champagne brunch at Queen Mary's Grand Salon is a wonderful treat! Diverse & quality selection and endless champagne, coffee, OJ & soda. A harpist plays music in the center of the buffet station. Highly recommend reservation for holidays, especially Mother's Day.",TravelWithRiley
50,Definitely worth the VIP tour ticket,"As a boy I actually sailed on the Queen Mary so that made it a must but the whole family loved it.(And it was built in Glasgow) Dithered about the cost at first but in the end the VIP ticket for all tours was definitely worth it. They haven't altered the ship too much, so it's a real sense of history (for a California attraction). Ghosts&Legends was hilarious, not tacky at all, a must do (especially ""scary"" Dustin!). Other times we had whole decks to ourselves and played hide and seek. Long Beach seafront also very nice. Leave yourself most of the day there.",david t
50,Step back in time!!,"The last 2 times I have been in LA I didn't get to see the Queen Mary, so last week I insisted that we see it before we go! It is beautiful and we easily spent 4 hours wandering around as there is lots to look at and great photographic diplays. It really is a marvellous piece of history and I am sorry we couldn't stay the night. I tried really hard to see one of the reported ghosts, but to no avail! You can even go sort of under the boat to see one of her propellers and into the engine room which was also fascinating. When we were looking through the beautiful shops I could hear lovely Glen Miller type music from down the hallway. I walked down and opened very heavy, ornate doors and found a 20 piece band consisting of men who were no younger than 65, in full tuxedos, playing 30's type music. On the dancefloor were a heap of older couples, all dressed up, dancing on the gorgeous dancefloor and sipping champagne!! Well I could have cried, I was raised by my grandparents and I felt transported right back to when they were younger. I could have sat there all day, remember this was lunchtime on a Tuesday!! Everyone was so happy and I felt that this is exactly what ""The Queen"" would have been like when she was in her prime. Unfortunatley as of July 1st, these dances will not happen again due to lack of funding or something like that! My husband and I were just in the right place at the right time. Remember the scene in Titanic when she dies and goes back on the ship , and it comes to life and everyone is there to greet here ..exactly the same feeling for us that day!",KateandShaunLacey
50,The Real Love Boat,"We stayed aboard in June 03 for our 30th anniversary, loved the trip to Catalina, we just MUST go again, the stateroom was magnificent, the long corridors smelling of wood and varnish.We had our special meal in Sir Winstons, the food was excellent and the staff just could not do enough.This visit was planned as something very special for us and it was more and better than we could have imagined, along trip from UK but very much well worth it.",Tulsablue
50,History comes alive!!,"We stayed on the Queen Mary in April and she was beautiful. Anyone who is interested in history should stay on her - it makes you tingle when you think about who has been on her. Everything is so art deco and you really feel special and honoured to be there. We stayed in a Stateroom and it was really big. The furniture was all original and even our children (14 & 15) thought it was great. (They are not really into history!!). The bath is amazing - it fills up in about 10 seconds!! The staff and facilities are superb and if you loved Titanic, come live it for real!! Would not hesitiate to stay again.
