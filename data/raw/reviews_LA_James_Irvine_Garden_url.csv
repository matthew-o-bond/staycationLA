50,lovely time,"enjoyed this twice over august, once privately the other with Nissei Week. A true hidden gem in all those new condo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaswilliamm
50,Lovely escape,"This garden is best accessed through the Japanese cultural center building via an elevator (though there is a side gate access during the day with steps down to the sunken garden). This garden is small but a really nice retreat away from the surrounding downtown cement. You can skip around the loop through the garden (with lots of greenery, twisty trees, and a gurgling stream) within about 5 minutes. But it's worth taking the time to sit on a stone wall or boulder and breathe for a bit. Absorb the green and water. There were lovely flitting bright red dragon flies and a few flowers here and there. Not a destination in itself but definitely worth a bit of a side trip from a nearby hotel or traipsing through Little Tokyo or nearby Mexican or China areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schrodster
50,"From Above or Below, Be Sure to Go","This beautiful garden is a must while in L.A. Sunday is good because street parking is free. It will be unavailable if they are having a photo shoot or a wedding, but, since the garden is below surface level, you can still see it from above. Walk to the east end and try the gate. If it is locked (or if you don't like stairs), go into the building on the west side and take an elevator to the bottom floor. Turn right and you'll see the door to the garden. Absolutely an escape from the big city! Bring your camera. Allow 30-60 minutes. And, before or after, wander around the Noguchi Garden above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobmD9792HR
20,We were underwhelmed.,We visited the Japanese Cultural Center and the James Irvine Garden the day after Thanksgiving. The garden was the only part that was open.The garden is very small and intimate. I am sure it would be prettier in the spring when the flowers were blooming. It would also be better if they had the water flowing through the stream.At least it was free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193KathyO
