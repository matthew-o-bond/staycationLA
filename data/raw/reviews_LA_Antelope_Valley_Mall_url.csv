40,Some good anchor stores,"Had some time to kill so took a spin around most of the main shops and a few in between. Plenty to see but little that spoke to me personally. Lots of sales but few deals. Wrong season I guess. The real fly in the ointment though was not being able to access internet using the mall's WI-FI. Maybe this was momentary; but, I couldn't use my whatsapp to make a phone call. A bummer when you travel with a phone package....",bfindysz
10,The Antelope Valley Mall is turning into a swap meet,"Very disappointing selection of clothing in ALL the major stores. It is no secret that the major chain stores send the garments that do not sell elsewhere in their other stores up here to the Antelope Valley mall and it SHOWS. Macy's, JCPenney, Sears, New York & Co ALL had the worst selection with garments squashed onto the shop floors in no particular design or style. Mismatched garments and sizes all mashed tightly together made it impossible to shop in all of these stores. Boring boring boring. Many people just hanging out for the air conditioning and no sign of security. I can never find anything I want to buy here anymore and will continue to shop online from here on out, unless I leave town and visit a city with better shopping malls. The food court operates at 50% with half the food outlets closed down. Too many closed down stores here too, with Forever21 being the latest anchor store to close. Word is that Forever21 is opening up in a smaller location inside the mall but no sign yet but it doesn't really matter anyway because F21 has the biggest yard sale collection of mismatched garments of all.",Sandy
40,KB,I have always enjoyed this mall but feels like new owners may be letting it slide down hill. Armed professional security has been canceled and the new security looks terrible with each one having different uniforms. The guys seem to be more interested in picking up girls than security.Stores are slowly going out of business and vacancy rate is climbing. This is a great place ro walk in the morning and they now delay the opening by one hour. I think they have also cut back on cleaning staff as the other day trash cans were over flowing. I hope there is a turn around. I would hate to lose the mall or it not be safe to visit.,Kyle B
40,NIce large mall,"Large mall, lots of shops, parking, places to eat either in the mall or nearby. Several nice anchors stores such as Macys and also has a movie theater and hotel on property",Speedracer61
30,When you are in the desert and need a mall,"After taking my granddaughter to a movie at the cinema complex just outside this mall, we went in to look for something and grab a bit of lunch to eat.The food court had a disappointing selection of strange eateries. None of the brand name fast food chains. In the end we found something to snack on. Also had a hard time finding a department store with a children's toy department. but also found what we were looking for at Penneys and Sears.A nice enough place to stroll around even if the offerings aren't what a big mall usually has.",bfindysz
40,KB,Good shops and restaurants. Lots of parking. Very clean on outside and inside. Security is friendly except Jan. Also a good place to walk if the weather is inclimate.,Kyle B
