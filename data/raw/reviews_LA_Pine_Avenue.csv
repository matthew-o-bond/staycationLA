40,A revival of Downtown,"In the past downtown was the place to go for shopping and business. Then as other venues were built outside the downtown area, such as the Lakewood Mall and others, downtown long beach went into a spiraling decline. Then a decade or more the city fathers were successful in building housing and lofts in some new and converted some of the old stores into housing units. Now that people actually live downtown it has started a revival of sorts. With the convention center just on the other side of Ocean Blvd and the revival at what used to be the Pike, it is booming with a multitude of restaurants serving whatever your taste buds hunger for. There is one failed Mall several blocks up but everything else seems to be doing well.",BobandMargie G

40,Good spot for nightlife,"Pine Avenue is the main street for restaurants and nightlife in Downtown Long Beach, but that's really all that's there. There's always plenty of people around during the daytime, but Friday night is when the majority of people are out enjoying themselves - the rest of the week is fairly quiet in the evening. A nice spot for lunch or an evening meal whilst you're in Long Beach, but you certainly wouldn't visit the city specifically to come to Pine.",Adam R

40,Very good selection of restaurants,Pine Avenue has a very diverse selection of mostly very good restaurants above Ocean Avenue. My favorites are L'Opera and King's Fish House. I am looking forward to trying the new George's Greek Café that just opened up on Pine Avenue. There are a lot of additional restaurant choices on Pine Avenue going down towards the ocean.,David from La Palma
40,"Lots of good choices for dining, not many for shopping","Pine Avenue and the nearby area (Broadway, the Promenade, etc.) offer a large range of restaurants and bars, so there is something for everyone's taste and budget. Options include seafood, burgers, Spanish, Greek, pizza, BBQ, fine dining and much more. Easy to walk to from the large hotels on Ocean Drive (such as the Westin, the Hyatt, and the Renaissance).Frankly, I wouldn't recommend the shopping in this area - they have tried for decades to make this a shopping destination and it has never quite worked. Yet again, they are tearing out / remodeling parts of the shopping ears for another remodel. My recommendation - do your shopping (or window shopping) on 2nd Street in Belmont Shore and then do your eating on or near Pine Ave (shopping is better in Belmont Shore, dining is better in the Pine Ave area).If driving to the Pine Ave area, here is a tip - park in one of the public parking garages which offer no-validation-needed 2 free hours parking (one of them is on 4th Street between Long Beach Blvd and Pine). If you are just going for lunch or a casual dinner, you'll likely be there and back within the 2 hours - even if you stay out longer, the cost for time over two hours isn't too huge in comparison with private parking or valet.",Lynda V

20,Downtown area of Long Beach needs help,"Second business visit in the last year and each time I visit the Pine Av, convention areas of the Downtown area seems one step worse. The storefronts continue to turnover quick, boarded up and empty. The volume of homeless and destitute seems to increase two fold each time. It could be a nice area if the city would move the campers off the government parks, get them to shelters or remove what ever it is that lures them to your tourism, convention and historic area. It's not dangerous yet, but comfort level of walking alone in the area is starting to be questioned by visitors and businesses",cndrocks
40,Gs wedding,A lot of choices for dining. Parking is a problem. We are used to free parking where we come from - so $10.00 to park a car seems a little pricey,Les L

20,A little too pretentious and fake for my liking...,"- Long beach is much prettier than Santa Monica and Venice Beach. More peaceful with more families with kids and less homeless people.- Food was expensive. Be prepared to pay tourist price.- It will take about 1h 30 mins to get from downtown LA to Long Beach via train.- Seems to have lots of parking sports but you will have to pay .- This place is also a little heaven for the rich Americans. It looks to me a little over-pretentious.- A corndog cost about $4 and a bottle of water cost $2 for a mini size bottle.- Visiting once is enoughIf you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'",TravelQueenie365
40,Pine Avenue Where All the Restaurants are Located,"Pine Avenue just up the block from the convention center has much fine dining. Sevilla, Georges, Kings, and many more are all excellent choices for dining. The only drawback is that it makes it hard to decide where to eat sometimes.",pipehorse

You will find a transportation center next to the Blue Line that's first class and they have walking guides ( dressed in a Red Shirt that are very helpful if you need directions and they also provide extra security. First its a hub for transportation the Blue Line and extensive bus service (one of the best in L.A.County)They have a free bus that goes down Pine to 8th st and to the shoreline Village and the Queen Mary. If you have the time and small amount of luggage you can save $20.00 and take the Blue Line to then Green Line, hop on a bus that will drop you off at the terminal of you airline. It takes about 40 minutes and during heavy traffic hours is faster than a cab.Warning the Blue line attracts some crazy people, but not dangerous. I always take the Blue line to LAX ,during normal hrs. Good luck and hope you had as nice stay.I retired here but do not work for the city",anodynemed
30,Living on Pine,"I LIVE on pine.What does pine have to offer? Pine always keeps reinventing itself. What I like about pine is all the money they put into it.

Most are closed during the day and only open at night. Can get quite crowded if there are conventions or events in town, such as in my case, the Reggaefestival. There were so many people out, make sure you make dinner reseravtions in advance. The later it gets, the crazier it gets. Go with a group and stick together.

It's relatively safe and a few blocks down on Shoreline Village are more restaurants and a game place for all ages.
