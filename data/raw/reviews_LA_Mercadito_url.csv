50,A Piece of Mexico,This place always reminds me of when I was a kid and my parents would bring me here and I would always enjoy looking at all the things from Mexico. The Mexican treats at the entrance make it worth the trip. Parking is good because they have someone directing traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockyR148

50,Locals love it,"I grew up about 4 blocks from this place. Weekends here are crowded with locals looking for good deals on lots, and LOTS of Mexican goods. You can get everything form pinatas, candies, and fresh cheeses, and cream to clothes, shoes, blankets, and jewelry. The food court area offers a great variety of Mexican treats too many to name. It's a really fun place to visit, go hungry and ready to try it all or at least half.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wickedelf
