20,Catalina Island,"I was very disappointed on my visit to the island. There was not much to do. After walking and visiting a few shops and then lunch we were thinking what do we do now? We had to wait 4 hours for our ferry back. We tried to reschedule, but we’re told all the other times to go back were full. So basically we just sat and people watched. Did I mention this was a Saturday and the Casino was closed?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8452MXmaryo
30,Day trip to Catalina,"I visited the island which stands 26 miles off the coast from Long Beach via ferry in 1993 and other than a facelift of some buildings and casino it’s pretty much the same. Honestly outside of hiking around, shopping and eating not much to do. We took a hour long golf cart ride around the “living area” of Avalon for $50. After that and lunch we were ready to head back to mainland. Think this was a one and done deal for us, it’s beautiful but minimal activities on island and we are not into gambling",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danp819
50,Go here for information on Catalina Island,Right at the front of the Pleasure Pier on the left. Staff are helpful and will look up what they do not know off the tops of ther heads. Plenty of brochures are helpful too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephEllis
10,Weird vibes,"I love Catalina been here 4 times is of today! However this time around I traveled solo as I needed some time to myself to regroup from the city life. Not Shure if because I was solo that I noticed alot more things that I didn't like or what but the energy felt weird during my 3 day stay! I felt this vibe from the locals that they hate us tourist and here's is why I feel this way: locals don't make an effort to engage with the tourist,no eye contact no warmth they walk around as if you are an annoyance like you are invisible to them it's weird. Even the people working the shops,restaurants and attractions seemed very non chalant like ok, Shure bye! Very to the point cold not in a good way. and you know it's bad when you can't wait to get back home from vacation.Not Shure what the deal is with the locals but tough luck deal with it we all do at our daily lives back home be happy we tourist you hate are their supporting your economy since 85% if not 100% of your economy depends on tourism so suck it up locals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cesarloves
10,so much potential--events just are not up to potential,"I have come to Avalon 5 times, 3 times for events at the Casino, NY Eve, Jazz Festival and now the Art Deco Gala--they are all expensive rip offs--little or no food, hard or impossible to get a chair or table--God help you if you ran out of time to get a table reserved-- I just got back-- 75 bucks for Art Deco--no food at all(included) and you have to fight for a stupid chair?? I injured my knee and could not dance much but it took us 20 minutes to find a chair; at the past Jazz festical-- folks are talking up a storm over the music--- NY Eve was the best but could ahve been much better; Avalon cannot decide whether to cater to cruise ships or the LA crown-- too many junky t shirt shops with the same damn things---they need more unique higher end shops---in fact you need to open a desalinization plant and water the Island, do farm to table from Catalina--change the statement--Island seems to be dying and the cabbie said biz off by over a third---so much potential!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/822JohnS

30,Very Disappointing Day Trip,"We have been visiting San Diego in October for some time now and were urged each time by a personal friend to visit Catalina Island. This time we made the trek via the Catalina Express. The port area is nice with shops and a small playground nearby. We rented a golf cart to see more of the island and discovered that there was very little to see and do for persons not into water sports or rock climbing. Besides some costly tours and an adventure excursion, there is nothing really going on. We walked down the main street and discovered many shops closed down and others extremely pricey and specialized. Although it is expensive to live on Catalina Island, as we discovered by perusing some real estate listings, I have no idea how service workers manage to make a living. One restaurant server told us that he rents a 200 square foot apartment about the size of a large walk-in closet for $800 a month. Another said they make the daily ferry trip back to Dana Point where they can live more cheaply. I took away the feeling that Catalina Island is a haven for the rich who don't need to work and little else, certainly not for those trying to make a living or looking for something to do while viewing the tranquil town and waters. During our day stay, there was a Jazz Festival going on so people were on hand for that. There was also a Fall Festival going on that began around 5 p.m. It looked like fun, but the ferry left around that time so we didn't get to participate. Forget gambling at the casino as it's a venue rather than what most people consider as a casino. Needless to say, it was a wasted day. People say we needed to stay overnight, but we wondered ""why?""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynne0725
50,Day Trip To Avalon,"Every time I have been in LA I wanted to visit Catalina Island. This time I finally did and was thrilled with what was there. It all began in Long Beach where we boarded the Catalina Express. The cost was $66.50 @ (senior rate). You can stay inside or outside or both. Cruising out, we passed the QE2 and the waterfront of Long Beach. The 45 minute ride to Avalon was easy enough with porpoises (dolphins) happily jumping and showing off. When we got there, we took the Avalon Express (Grimaldi) bus tour. It is a hop on-hop off service costing only $1 @ every time you board. Our driver pointed out interesting sights and told us the history of the island along the way. We traveled through town and then up a canyon where the Wrigley Memorial and Botanic Gardens are located. The hike up to the enormous monument was a bit taxing but the view toward the Pacific ocean made it all worth while. Ms. Wrigley's garden had unusual plants imported from all over the world. Admission was $5 @ and worth it. It rarely rains on Catalina so most of the plants were drought tolerant types. When we returned to town, we strolled around the waterfront on Crescent Avenue from the marina to the Casino which interestingly enough has never had gambling. This pedestrian only street is lined with shops, restaurants, bars, hotels, etc. We spied a happy hour sign at one and toasted our bucket list check mark with a generous Margarita for $4 @. This was a bargain because otherwise things are not cheap on Catalina. Our return trip was after dark but rewarding because the QE2 and Long Beach waterfront were all lit up. The Chamber's website was very helpful for planning our little excursion. We enjoyed our day and appreciate the warm hospitality shown by the locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthT6808IS

10,Don't waste your time depending on the employee,"We went to the visitors bureau on the pier around late afternoon and it looked like a high school or college aged young lady was working the desk. I felt like somebody put a warm body there so somebody would be present. We asked her a few questions about the ferry, how or where to catch the bus for the Hermit Gulch Trail and info about a glass bottom boat that we heard about. When she failed to answer any of these questions we knew she wasn't going to be able to help in anything much more so we left. I felt it was very disappointing since they were very basic questions. We stuck to asking strangers, locals, the lady at the conservatory and our concierge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicytravelasian
10,Glad a new visitor center is being planned.,"I went here to find out the time and location to catch the new electric bus.

20,Fishing Avalon,"Catalina (Avalon Harbor)Let me first say we usually go to Two Harbors on Catalina for our fishing trip and have had no issues other than the limited accommodations. This year we tried Avalon due to the larger variety of accommodations. After crossing from Dana Point in our boat and an afternoon fishing, we came into the harbor and met the Harbor Patrol, rented a mooring (no reservations, first come first serve) $124 for 3 nights. Condo was great, hauled our tackle down to the water taxi the next morning at 6:15am for a day of fishing. We quickly found out the taxi starts running at 7am (not the most optimal for early fishing). The operator got there at 7:15am, warm up his boat and we were finally off around 8am (I guess it’s Island Time).After a long day fishing, we dropped everyone off at the dock ($5 pp for the taxi) and went to the mooring we had rented (or did we?). There was a boat on our mooring and were told by the Harbor Patrol that the owner had shown up so they moved us. A little aggravation and time wasted we moved to the new mooring.The next morning, swam to the boat, got an early start, after a hard day of fishing, came in dropped everyone, and tied up to the mooring. Took the kids to the swimming area and had to call the condo to have the boat key brought down ASAP. The Harbor Patrol called and said the owner had shown up and I had to move the boat right away or it would be towed to the new mooring at my expense! Much more aggravations, a couple hours of vacation wasted, and $10 in taxi fees. What was it I rented for $124?Recapping, if you want a relaxing trip to hangout on the beach, shops, or restaurants, Avalon isn’t a bad trip. If you’re going on a fishing trip, not the place to waste your time or money at least until the Harbor Department gets a workable mooring reservation system in place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yuki2

10,Visitor Dismayed At Tone of Locals,"Their wasn't a category for reviewing the Catalina locals, so I'm doing it here.I've visited Catalina dozens of times over the years. The last visit was ten years ago, so I was excited to get a chance to come out and relive my earlier enjoyments. Love Catalina. Carming. Quaint. Unrushed. Singular!Holy Hating Locals Batman.Not one smile from the hotel people. Not one pleasant word from an ice cream vendor. No eye contact from attraction vendors. What's going on here???I am a happiness guy. Love reaching out. Love learning about people. Love getting off the beaten path and seeing the 'real' place.After a day and half, I can't wait to leave. I hope this is a one-off, bad timing kind of thing.But I'm afraid the non-existant customer service, the hostile-pitality (new coined term) and total lack of any kind of niceness amongst the locals is the current state of mind here.I know the tension between locals and tourists is an eternal struggle. Locals in Hawaii have at least learned to fake all of the above. Catalina can take a page from their playbook.I asked one clerk at the boat vendor if she lived here. She grew up here. ""Do you like it?"" I asked.""I hate it here"" was her reply.""Why?""""Because it's stale and hateful.""The maid at my hotel all but growled at me at I was leaving my room this afternoon. Massive scowl as I bid her a good day. No reply.Maybe this all happened since Cruise ships started dumping their passengers here in the last decade or so. Maybe the onslaught of day-trippers has them jaded. Maybe the economy causes them to work for dirt cheap. Maybe maybe maybe. All I can say is that it is palpable. Cut it with a knife. Too bad. Leaving early.Cheer up Catalina, you're living on an island with a fraction of the troubles the rest of us encounter on a daily basis. When's the last time you had a commute? Gang violence? Metal detectors in school? Jammed in a subway car until you can't breath? Cars speeding through your neighborhood?You live on an enchanted paradise! Get over your sniveling little gripes and smile at us when we come to help you survive!Sheesh.Visitors Bureau! Get some kind of ""smile"" campaign going. Hospitality training! Courtesy workshops. Greeting meetings. Live it up! Take acting classes. Method acting. Reach way back into your past and get in touch with your joy, your bliss, your passion. Do something to help your people rise up and love something about this wonderful little slice of heaven.Dang!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422josephs
20,Not impressed at all,They had a good choice of brochures and such but the woman at the place seemed preoccupied with reading and didn't seem to want to be disturbed. Why was she there then?

These are the only official tours with guides who know the history, the geology, the flora and fauna of the island and I would recommend that you take their tours rather than some others. We took the 3-hour jeep tour and had Andrew as our tour guide He is marvelous and kept a constant spiel going about the history, geology and nature and filled with little anecdotes and stories about previous inhabitants. He also lived on the island during the 2007 fire and has some harrowing stories about that.

10,DON'T GO !! >BEWARE OF DEPUTIES OUT OF CONTROL ...........,"We are a group of 55-60 family & friends ( normally 40% of our group would be children) that had been going to Catalina for over 30 years and did so in July 2012 . Here is our short story:After a full day with the kids at various activities - a small group of the adults(9) family & friends most of which were either mothers,fathers,brothers,sisters,cousins,pregnant ladydecided to leave the children with the Grandma's & Grandpa's and go out to have a little adult time.This was a MISTAKE ......... They were not aware of the brutal law enforcement mentality on the Island - they did not realize the ""Local Sheriff's"" are bullies, bigots and are always looking for ways to ""get a little action"" to quote one of them that night.Simply said - when one of the bartendars at a local ""joint"" took a disliking to one of the 9 vacationers we believe they made a personal call to one of the ""Cowboy"" deputies , started a disturbance (no one got hit- the bartendar actually jumped over bar & attacked patron) and wouldn't you know it - this deputy with 3 more of his buddies show up , throw this individual to the ground, rough him up pretty bad, tase him 3 times while on his stomach & restrained completely. (by the way all this is happening while his 9 yr old son is with his Mom & Dad).Also - he was never even tested for alcohol,what took place next is even more terrible - they throw him in the Catalina jail overnight, charge him with 1 felony for assulting a police officer,and 2 misdemeanors. Next morning they take him to LA County Jail from Catalina Island.In conclusion - ""Just don't go - and if you do - don't rub a local the wrong way or you will pay the price ""After posting $50,000.00 bail , 18 months of stress , depression & court appearances , well over $55,000.00 in attorneys fees and misc cost it is coming to some kind of closure ...........Please keep in mind - this person was 100% innocent of any wrong doing here - we have sworn statements by a number of those in bar that night , video's showing brutal treatment by deputies, pictures showing damages - doesn't matter - The legal system in this country is corrupt and unjust !! Whatever the cop says is believed >> no matter what happens.He ended up excepting a ""PLEA BARGAINING"" agreement only to avoid extra trial cost that would have exceeded another $50,000.00 and countless trips to Long Beach court house.Many Thanks for reading this - and please WARN your Friends & Family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sotota

The water taxi was took us from the boat to the Pier. So many nice bars and restaurants around. It is worth a trip with a golf cart to see the Avalon. The people in Catalina is very friendly, I think that's way it such a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RENE74_11
50,FABULOUS,stopped in real quickly to ask one question and that was where to get a great veggie burger. Luau Larry's was recommended and it didn't disappoint..!! Would definitely accept their suggestions again.!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolk148
10,Too small after they moved it.,Bad location for the information center. It's on the Pier. It used to be on the main street of town which was larger and more convenient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodye724
40,Helpful,When you bring guests to the island the visitor center comes in really handy if they have a question of any kind. The staff is really friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCStolz
40,My family and I really enjoyed our day trip.,I recommend a visit to Catalina Island. There is fun and relaxation for all ages! Please get to all departures early so you can have a better choice of seating on the boat to and from Catalina.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanm741
30,"polite, but not really warm","I have to say, they were informative. Straight to the point. I guess that is their job they recommended maps and what to do and not to do. If you need a hiking permit , they are the place to go ! A must if you decide to hike .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennB446
50,"Aussies,you have to go here.","We(2aussie couples)were so impressed with this most beautiful island!!!the weather was perfect,we went in the middle of May.We went over on the fabulous Catalina Express,did the golf cart tourFANTASTIC!!the guy at the desk was full of info,we returned the buggy at lunch and went back to the buggy(no charge during our lunch)had a most memorable lunch at The Lobster Trap,lobster to die for!!!!,did some shopping.The views were SPECTACULAR from all the viewing points on this pretty island.We will be back and most likely stay over night next time,Congrats Catalina Island(Avalon)you have a real paradise with such friendly locals....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959pollym
50,Visitors Bureau very helpful,Their assistance was invaluable as we planned our first rip to Catalina. They were prompt in replying to my inquiries. Usually the same day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyingdiamond
40,Fulfill your need to know.,It's a little unusual for me to want to review one of these entities but these folks were so nice. Very helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenC35
40,A worthwhile first stop in Avalon,"If you have never visited or not visited in a while, this is a great first stop for your Avalon visit. The friendly staff will help you plan your stay and provide you with details and background not available on the website.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Techkraut
50,Got a question? Stop here,This was a good place to find out more about the island. The folks working here know the answers. Also accessible online before taking the boat over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daruth
40,"A beautiful scenic place, definitely worth a day trip when in LA","We decided to take a day trip to Catalina on our recent visit to US. The journey started with a high speed Catamaron that took apx 80 minutes to reach Avalon. On disembarking you are overwhelmed by the scenic beauty of this unique island. The sea is so clean that you can see colourful fishes just near the shoreline. Well maintained clean roads with no cars and no pollution make one feel the real freshness in air. Visitors enjoy walking, and get attracted to activities like canopying,boating, scuba diving etc. There are three places offering golf cars on rental at $40 an hour and this is the best way to explore the island and see its beauty from high up in the hills.Many shops display souvenirs for visitors and many food outlets offer variety of dishes to satisfy your taste buds. But one should not miss the fresh fish dishes that have a unforgettable taste.Overall, it was a real enjoyable outing that had Catamaron rides, golf car rides and fantastic food while enjoying this scenic island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vrvaid
50,Catalina was Magic !,"We enjoyed a few days in Catalina and WOW ! It was beautiful, full of history, fabulous weather and really nice people ! We took several tours, 2 with our guide Cindy Lowe in the Retro Bus and a Hummer....I would definitely recommend her ..... she was really a GREAT guide , she shared hours of Catalina History, and was really fun :))Becky was our guide for the ""Avalon City Tour""...she was Super !We also went on the Zip-Line Eco Tour. The little red headed gal @ the desk was really sweet, she got us in on the next tour....and BIG thumbs up for Tim & Keven ! They were super guys and made our first zip-line experience a great one :))) The Catalina Zip-Line is 5 lines !!!A must do.Catalina was just Magic :) We just loved it:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3HappyTourist
50,"Day Trip to Calalina Island, Avalon, California","Visit Catalina Island for great a day trip.The small town of Avalon is extreamly picturesque. There are many opportunites to take some great scenic photo. The harbor is full of boating activity. This includes tour boats, private rentals, to many local boats. The architecture of the island has a turn-of-the-century feel, but is very ecclective with it's style. There are many places to shop and stroll. Many bars and restaurants to sit and eat. There is a sandy beach to relax at and catch some sun directly downtown.The town is compact and extreamly walkable. A lot can be found and seen within this very small area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rome949
30,Gets the Job done - no frills,GET THERE EARLY!!! this is one thing you have to do to make the day enjoyable. I you are wanting to sit inside you need to be in front of the pack. If you have a lot of luggage or bikes you need to be early. If you have kids you need to be early. BE EARLY! Parking is not next to the dock so you need to listen to the parking directions on their phone message. $15.00 for the day parking lot. On the return trip be in line by 3:30 p.m. for easy access to the boat. And... make sure you spend some time on-line booking events ahead of time so you are not scrambling for tickets when you get there. Be aware that the boat arrives about 10:30 a.m. and leaves at 4:30 p.m. when making arrangements. Glass Bottom Boat sells out early as does the Submarine - but both are wonderful for Kids. Steve's Steakhouse serves a good lunch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancycand
50,helpful,It was easy and easy going at the visitors bureau. Everthing was explained so you weren't confused. No hurry. Just what the island is famous for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desertclone
50,very helpful,The lady at the visitors center was very well versed in her job ...She answered all my questions and gave us a map drawing a route to where we wanted to go...she was always smiling,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynkidd42
40,Very helpful,I found the visitor's bureau to be very helpful. They have lots of information on the island and the various tours that are available A word of caution though - a lot of the tours sold on the island are over-priced and lock you into what they think you need to see. I found self-exploration of the island to be the best way to go. You can stop where you like and take as long as you need. Only problem is that as a tourist you are limited on where you can go on foot or on a bicycle. Lots of places do not allow golf carts either. So you are stuck with having to take the highly priced tours if you want to see the inside and other side of the island. It is a gorgeous island but also quite pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Saul
30,Not Very Helpful,The woman in the booth basically pushed us off to the ticket sales people. She wasn't very helpful. When we asked about tours that were advertised at her booth she told us the people at the ticket sales would be able to answer our questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhittierTraveler
30,Not the most forthcoming person,"We were looking for information on how to get to the interior of the island, and while the lady was friendly enough, it seemed like she wasnt to most forthcoming with information. I felt like you had to ask the right questions to get any information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaneH90
50,Must do,"Hike to gardens from town worth the hike, you will pass Chicago Cubs old training facility established by Wrigley and golf purse. Gardens are excellent and wonderful view from memorial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveA692
50,great whirlwind visit to Catalina Island,"the agent was well informed and gave us great directions.The tour guide on the ""scenic drive"" was full of facts and information re: the entire island.The fish we had for lunch was fabulous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccah687
50,Good place to stop off,"Staff very friendly and helpful. We had one day and wanted to see as much as we could. Kind person helped us to decide, and as a bonus we booked three trips and were given a discount for doing so. Recommend, the Semi submersible, sea kelp forests and fish amazing, Skyline tour, our driver was informative and great fun, good way to see the island too, and the flying fish evening trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaFoale
40,"Helpful, if not too friendly","Lady in the office always gave me information, but was usually brusque, and sent me off somewhere else for further information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fK8b0c6m
20,"Catalina Island ""Must-Knows""","I just completed a one-day visit to Catalina Island. Prior to this visit, I reviewed and referenced the official Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau website, which provides a list (with descriptions) of things to do on Catalina Island; however, there are absolutely NO specifics. For instance, we took the Catalina Flyer over from Newport Beach. On the boat, there was a representative from Santa Catalina Island Resort Services, which manages many of the activities, restaurants, etc on the island. Beautiful brochure, descriptions, costs, etc. We decided we'd like to do the Cape Canyon Expedition ($108), but when we went to reserve our spot, we were told that it starts at 9 am (we wouldn't be arriving on Catalina Island until 10 am). Another, 2 hour expedition, was an option, however the last one leaves at 2 pm, and our return boat to Newport was scheduled to leave at 4 pm--cutting it too close. We walked over to the Casino/Museum, and missed the museum tour by half an hour and there are no self-guided tours allowed. Three big disappointments. There are many things to do on Catalina, but the ""official"" website does not provide any detailed information about these things, so that visitors can plan their day accordingly. Because we were sort of ""stuck"" in town (Avalon), we did have a wonderful lunch at the Avalon Grille, and a great server, Russ. But be aware if you are traveling to Catalina Island for a day, you will be limited in your options for activities.Bottom line is that the official website should have specific, easy to locate information about these activities that includes dates available, start and finish time, costs, etc. Make it easy for your tourists, so that they can have the best experience possible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonB762
50,Must go to,Excellent pace to visit with family. Lots to do. Good shopping. wonderful parasailing and submarine ride. Enjoyed a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Archana2010
30,A Good Starting Place,If you have never been to Avalon they will be very helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/libertiesemail
50,Great information,Really liked the help. Gave us ideas we wouldn't have thought of,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaoskampma
50,Very helpful,Knowledgeable with suggestions and maps and brochures. We decided to take the 2 hour island tour which was so much fun and so beautiful but if you don't like small roads going to the top of the mountain don't go. They serve champagne in a beautiful spot overl looking the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bridgetpianos
50,Great day trip!,"While visiting Long Beach, my wife and I took a day trip to Catalina Island. We had a great time! We couldn't have asked for any better weather. We did some shopping, eating, then chilled on the beach with a few drinks in some rented lounge chairs overlooking the beautiful bay. This would be a nice quiet place to visit for a few days as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firstplaceace
30,Over priced,It has been a few years since I visited but even then I thought the entire place was over priced. It's a nice view and all but I guess I'm just not into paying so much money for so little. I think this place is more for people to try and show off how much money they have (or want people to think they have).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonyak81
50,I had no idea there was so much to see and do on this little island.,"There's something for everyone here--restaurants, hiking, botanical garden, museum, beaches, fishing, camping, biking, golfing, tennis, and more. If possible, it's best to purchase a package deal that includes round-trip reservation on the express boat ride over and one or two nights in a hotel on or near the waterfront. I say this after our one day whirlwind visit. We also had sunny, warm weather and uncrowded conditions contributing to our near perfectl visit. Once we arrived on the island, we hiked to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Garden which was a 1 1/2 mile gradual incline. However, there was no food or drink available the day we were there, so after the hike up, we were very hungry and thirsty. We then headed straight down the mountainside for one of the wharfside restaurants. After that, we headed for the Catalina Island Museum in the casino building. Along the path to the museum, we enjoyed the colorful tile murals that tell the history of Santa Catalina. Inside the museum, we saw a video of the island's colorful history, objects and pictures that revealed the native American history as well as the the island's glamorous past when the the Chicago Cubs held spring training and Hollywood stars escaped on their yachts. We had a few minutes to walk around the village waiting for the express boat trip back, savoring the delights of this serendipitous visit. We saw a lot in a short time, but there are so many more things to do there that I can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1linvogel
50,Nice people,Very informative and nice to deal with. Lots of things to offer people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Molly1girl
40,Beautiful Catalina Island,"My family and I visited Catalina Island the week before Thanksgiving 2011. We found a reduced rate for the boat trip online and enjoyed the 2 hour ride. When we arrived, we used a coupon for golf cart rental and spent 2 hours traveling around the island. The next coupon that we used was for 18 holes of minature golf. The coupon was for buy oneget one free. The island was very beautiful and we have many pictures to help rememberour trip to Catalina island. I would highly suggest using the internet to help plan your tripsand help to save money at attraction such as Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom022
50,A week of rest and relaxation,"My husband and I came back from one week in Avalon, Catalina Island. This is the best one week you could give to yourself. Once there you quickly adjust to ""island time"" comtemplating your next move over an ice cream on the corner. There are several tours to choose, or rent a golf cart to tour the city. There are several activities available, walking, hiking, biking, water sports, tours and just sitting and watching the boats coming and going. All the people are very friendly and helpful. If you need a place to destress this is it, whether you spend a day, a week or a month. Avalon is a place where you can center yourself and yet it is just 26 miles from the Long Beach coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snookiet
50,One of my favorite Catalina attractions,"Great way to learn about the history of the island! Exhibits change often so even if you have visited before, worth another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilianaCASD
50,Awesome Day vacation!,"Visited the island with friends for my birthday. This was like my 5th visit. It's fun and relaxing at the same time. We drove a golf cart around the island, had a great lunch and just enjoyed the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NishaB_11
30,Overprice boat ride for a typical island adventure,"We were surprised at what we found or lack thereof on Catalina Island. I think it might be worth it if you came on a boat and stayed overnight but for a day trip, there wasn't much to do other than walk through a few tourist style shops and spend $160 r/t boat road via Catalina Express. I live in the San Juan Islands in Washington state so this adventure wasn't anything out of the ordinary for me but the expense certainly was. We had always heard how wonderful Catalina Island is.....I'm not sure why unless you live in LA, I can see where it's a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlejennings
40,Vista Del Mar,"Hotel room was great - clean and spacious and quiet. A sufficient quick breakfast and warm cookies available in the evening. Lovely view of the bay in foyer. If you like less crowds and cooler weather, late fall is a good time to go.Be sure to take the boat tour to see the kelp and the fish. Such a treat!jmbc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Experience30516
