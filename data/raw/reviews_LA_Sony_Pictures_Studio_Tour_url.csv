50,Sony Studio Tour Coffee & Conversation,"Your experience will begin in the Sony Museum, filled with actual props and artifacts from some of our most iconic productions. You have the opportunity for a photo op with a real Oscar and Emmy.Our guide was amazing, Keith Coogan the grandson of the late great Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester) was a wealth of knowledge and no stranger to the movie industry himself.Keith did the voice of Young Tod for the charming animated Disney picture ""The Fox and the Hound."" He has also starred ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" and was impressive as Jonathan ""Snuffy"" Bradberry in ""Toy Soldiers.""If you love the movies then this is a must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryM874
50,"our surly teen loved it, calling it ""EPIC!!""","The whole family toured together. 2 teens, 2 parents. our eldest teen was determined to hate everything about our trip, including this. But absolutely came around and was utterly mesmerized and completely engrossed by every word and everything we saw. Time and money well spent! We ALL loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IguanaElana
50,A fantastic tour!!,"We had a fantastic tour here. It's a walking tour and although I was a bit worried about how far/fast it would be, it was fine and not at all hard.The tour starts with an excellent check in procedure and then a look up close at some items from movies and tv including spiderman, breaking bad, MIB etc. Loved it and could take as many photos as we liked.We then enjoyed a short movie and (at my teens request) the Spiderman new movie trailer which was being released the next day.Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly and shared lots of great stories. He also organised movie posters and pins for the only two teens on the tour, a lovely gesture.The tour was really interesting and there is loads to see. We were lucky to also get into the soundstage used for all the starwars music by John William's.As always the tour finishes at the shop. It's a little shop very different to the Warner bros one and nicely priced for some souvenirs.I'd highly recommend this tour to all ages of movie fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808StephB-NZ
50,Great tour,"We had lots of fun on this tour. We drove around the lot and were able to go onto a couple of sets. The guide was very knowledgeable, and we all really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLZA
50,Sony Studio Tour,"First and only visit of a studio. Walking tour was informative, entertaining. I had my 80 year old parents with who enjoyed it as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion277167
50,Iconic Studio Lot in Los Angeles,I enjoyed learning about the history and background of any location I travel to but when you are in LA and want to get insight into a film and television studio this is the tour to take.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAmandaGreene
50,Fun AND Free!!!,"While in California, we decided to attend the taping of one of our favorite game shows, Wheel of Fortune. What a fun day that was!! Everyone connected with Sony Studios and the show were helpful, entertaining and informative. I'd do it again in a heartbeat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MableK_13
50,Great tour focused on how the movies are made,"Highly recommend this tour if you're interested in the actual details of how movies are made - the whole process. Our tour guide, Keith, was excellent and had an amazing knowledge of the the lot and the history. We got to visit several different stages, including the Jeopardy set, and saw some great movie memorabilia. An excellent tour, especially for the price as compared to other studio tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kas7686
40,Good tour,"My wife and I took the two-hour tour on January 23, 2020. Our guide, Choe (or Chloe?), was nice. I suggest the guides use microphones because with a larger group (there were twenty-two of us) it‚Äôs hard to hear. Also the guides should be employees of Sony, not temps. It shows. As far as the tour itself, awesome. People should take these tours only if they‚Äôre film and TV nerds. This tour was an opportunity to nerd out. I especially enjoyed seeing locations where the Wizard of Oz was filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road802753
30,SONY PICTURES STUDIO TOUR SOSO,"An interesting tour through the museum and the stages but the guid tour seemed a bit lost, he didn‚Äôt know which stages were able to be visited during the day (because of the acting) but there is a lot of accessories to see üòä",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasMcry
50,Great Tour,"Did this tour with my family of 4 (2 adults, 1 teenager and 1 child). Had a great time. The tour exceeded expectations with its personal touch. Did not feel like they were in the business of ripping people off. There was free valet parking, and a photo. Very pleased with this tour. Have done other tours, but this one exceeds my expectations. The grounds is smaller than other studio tours, but will definitely return due to the personal touch and small scale tour. It was all walking. Loved it! Thanks for a great tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleDi2
50,Amazing Hollywood experience,"Our visit to Sony Studios was amazing! The tour was on foot and unfortunately we did not get to see any celebrities, but the tour guide was the greatest guy ever! He was so happy with his job, he gave us details for every little thing in the studio, he took as through live sets and we even walked past a whole crue getting ready to shoot some episode in front of us! We also got to see many collectibles from Movies and series like Jumanji and Breaking Bad. If you are a big fun of Hollywood and movies and you do decide to take this tour, make sure that you ask for Keith to guide you! I guarantee you are going to have a wonderful time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afroditip757
50,Excellent Tour,"Our tour guide, Chloe, was very knowledgable and thorough. The 2 hour tour takes you around the massive campus and makes stops at the Museum, shop and whatever filming stages are available. I highly recommend visiting in the off season, when they're on break from filming as you'll see a lot more. The intro video is extremely well done and there a ton of history that you'll enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sconsaul
50,Outstanding,"Small groups, and one of the only tours I have felt connected with. Real working studios on show and add to that the rich history as MGM's former home. Perfect Hollywood experience.Excellent value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adjadj
50,Great tour,My family had a great time on this tour.Our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly.We got to see some amazing things and there was plenty of time. Never felt rushed.Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973kierana
50,Worth the money if you're into TV and movies,"My husband and I enjoyed this tour immensely. We were in town for a taping of ""Jeopardy!"" which was happening the next day. The tour gave us a sneak peak at the studio plus much more. We saw a museum with lots of memorabilia, got on the set of ""The Goldbergs,"" saw lots of vehicles used in various shows and movies including ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Breaking Bad."" We learned about the sound artists and learned a lot of history of the business. If you're into a variety of different television shows and movies, this is a definite must-do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyC4242
40,Fun and Insightful,We enjoyed the tour of Sony Pictures Studio. There were parts we really liked but also a little disappointed that we didn‚Äôt get to see the Jeopardy or Wheel stages. All in all though would do it again and recommend. Took about 2 hours. Comfortable walk. Nice guide. The museum at the start was really cool. Seinfeld set and lots of actual film used props,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sky9696
50,Wonderful intimate tour of the Studio,"Previously we had booked audience tickets for Wheel of Fortune and at the last minute decided to do the tour before the show. Unfortunately the show was cancelled due to Pat Sajak having emergency surgery! Our tour guide was excellent during the entire tour and I came away with a deep appreciation for the tremendous effort that is required to put on a TV show. They just so happened to be filming an episode of The Goldbergs during our tour. It is a lot of walking and bathrooms aren't always available, but the staff made an exception for me and allowed me to use the bathroom at the museum. Wonderful experience seeing the studio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VVHT
30,Nice tour but was hoping for more given the price tag,"We signed up for this tour because it was something different to do while visiting LA. It‚Äôs not cheap ($50), but if you can afford it, it was a fun way to spend 2 hours. After going though security, the guide takes your group to a ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù filled with props and other stuff from Sony movies ‚Äì there seems to be a disproportionate amount of Spider-man stuff. Anyway, after about 10 minutes, you start your walking tour of the property. The next 20 minutes were kind of boring as the guide points to a huge sound-stage and says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where Gone with the Wind was filmed‚Äù, or points to another monolithic sound stage and says that‚Äôs where such and such was filled. But you‚Äôre just staring at a big sound-stage with no windows and all of the doors are closed. Eventually, they take you to the sound-stage where Wheel of Fortune is taped ‚Äì and it‚Äôs cool to see the set, although much of it is mothballed because they only tape show 20 days a year. Then you go to the Jeopardy sound-stage, which is also cool to see ‚Äì but much of it is also moth balled because they only shoot 4 or 5 weeks a year. Finally, you get to see an active sound-stage ‚Äì in this case where the Goldberg‚Äôs sitcom is shot. They weren‚Äôt shooting that day but we got to go on the set as they were making it over for a different scene. Afterwards, they take you to the Sony gift ship to browse for 10 minutes and then the tour ends. Our guide was nice, and informative, but $50 seemed a it much for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jwkruz
40,Nice tour,It was nice but I think the other studios have more in depth tours. There were no VIP tours available the day we could go and that could have been the difference. I was interested in older films etc and more of a museum. Very nice tour guide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryBethWalls
40,A Fun Tour,"I actually took this tour in June 2018, however due to travelling all over the world for the last 18 months, I am just in the process of writing all the reviews. The day before I did the Warner Bros tour which I personally think is better than this one, but it‚Äôs still a good tour and it‚Äôs included in the Go Card. Our tour guide Dave was good but a bit long-winded when telling us info and I wouldn‚Äôt say there were as many highlights as Warner Bros. The tour started off in the memorabilia room which included props from The Goldbergs, Stuart Little, Click, Spiderman etc. From there, we went into a theatre room and watched an introduction to Sony before being split into two groups. This tour is on foot as everything is relatively close together. We went into an old backdrop room which contained the backdrop from the Sound of Music! We walked through the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune game show studios which are always located in the same place. Adam Sandler‚Äôs production company, Happy Madison, is also located here but he wasn‚Äôt in his office. Apparently he‚Äôs a really nice guy and stops for photos etc. so I‚Äôm gutted I missed him! We also saw the original Ghostbusters‚Äô car and the new one they used in the female version of the film. We were able to walk by Stage 15 which was the home to Munchkin Land in the Wizard of Oz as well as other studios where Kansas and the tornado were created. Dave also showed us a few other, more technical based, locations including the sound stage which was built back in the 1920s by Columbia Pictures. Personally though, my highlight was seeing The Goldbergs set. It was a good tour but if you‚Äôre short on time, I would recommend Warner Bros.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikkiBee
40,Sony Studio Tour,"A fun walking tour of the studio with a very enthusiastic guide, who had lots of fun facts and historical information to share.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebiC53
50,A Fun Relaxing Tour Led By The Best Guide. I loved it!,"Maybe it was Keith, our excellent tour guide, because I loved this tour. It was personable, interesting, relatively loose, and we saw a couple of stars! By walking around the lots and getting fairly spread out at times were were really able to soak up the working studio life. Stars, extras, executives, vehicles (including the original Ghostbusters car) passed by and it was exciting. Thanks Keith for such a great job!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denverroadtrip
50,Almost an individual private tour of a major studio,"Our group was 10, seems to be a regular size. Great guide, much info and significant history. Great museum, small but lots of key memorabilia. The bring you to different on-going sets as time permits. Our set team were wondering who we were and what we were doing on their set :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyage36330163518
40,Fun tour,"Very informative walking tour given by a guide (Khooe). Be sure to be near the front of the tour as it would have been hard to hear otherwise. Possibility to see a star at any time - saw Jim Carrey's car but not him unfortunately! Visited the sets of the Goldbergs and Wheel of Fortune, neither of which we watch but it was still cool to see. There is a Seinfeld set near the beginning of the tour which was great to see. Plenty of opportunity to take photos. There is a gift store towards the end of the tour, would have liked a bit longer time in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Savcat
50,Very Enjoyable Tour With An Expert Guide!,"Our tour guide was none other than Keith Coogan! Amazing tour, detailed historical background, fascinating visits to sound stages. Keith is fun to listen to and has an obvious love for the business and a broad and deep knowledge of the factors that have shaped its development. Educational and entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidW12935
50,Sony Studios Tour,"Just finished our tour of Sony studios and I must say we all enjoyed it very much.Chloe our tour guide was extremely informative and kept the 2hr or so tour going at a fast pace, also having said we were fans of the show The Goldbergs she made a point of getting us on all the key sets of the show which was amazing.The kids (12, 17) really got a kick out of it and so did I. We got to see a sets of Jeperdy, props from films and also so of the legendary cars used in movies like Ghostbusters.It is well worth going if you get the chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614lancee
50,Thoroughly Enjoyed the VIP lunch tour,"We decided that since this would likely be our last trip to LA that we would splurge and do the VIP lunch tour and are really glad we did. The tours are limited to a maximum of 5 and we were fortunate to be the only ones on our tour so there was lots of personalized attention from our awesome tour guide.Its a working studio so you don't have access to everything but we loved the small museum area and the access to the sets of Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, and The Goldbergs. Neat ""behind the curtain"" views - we even go to see Alex Trebek's notes from a Jeopardy show, which was pretty neat. And getting to eat in the Sony Commissary Dining room was cool as well.We absolutely loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hokiechip
50,best studio tour,"The tour guide was informed and really friendly. The studio was bustling with activities on the day of our tour. It was interesting to see a working studio up close. We saw the set of Jeopardy, The Barbara Streisand sound stage and other interesting things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrew752017
30,Promises more than delivers,"The tour covered the small museum, a meander around the outside of various studios, a look into the Wheel of Fortune and The Goldbergs sets and my highlight the special effects department.We found the museum quite limited and representing only a few shows. There was some cool stuff and maybe someone closer to American shows would have enjoyed this aspect more.The Wheel of Fortune and particularly the look behind the scenes at The Goldbergs were engaging enough.Being allowed into the Foley special effects studio and having some effects demonstrated was fun and illuminating.The guide was nice and bubbly friendly.Near the end there is about ten minutes to spend in the shop that caters for Universal branded gear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benbuzz
10,Used to be so much better.,"I went on this tour in 2006 and again in 2019. The second time the tour was completely different and much worse. I loved the original tour. They used to show you into the iconic main building, took you to the sound stage where they recorded the Wizard of Oz, some sets and a quick tour of some production offices where pitches take place. Nowadays they leave you in the car park on a bench, then shepherd you into a room of film props. The props are fun, but you get 3 minutes to look around. Then you see a 12 minute film saying how wonderful the studio is with some lacklustre new trailer. You are then walked around some back alley, shown into a TV show set (repeatedly told not to touch anything), the (empty and featureless) set of jeopardy and a sound recording studio. Then you go home. Wow. You get the distinct feeling they can't wait to get rid of you. It is dull, lifeless and cold. You don't get to see anything except the props and some Emmys. Then you are shown into the world's least interesting shop. I took my mother hoping it would be as great as it was the first time and was hugely disappointed. Even most of the people working there looked glum and subdued, as did the other guests. Not worth the money. Go to the Hollywood Museum instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreddmancunian
50,"Fun, Behind-the Scenes Tour!","Lots of great photo ops, really fun prop museum, and it was so exciting being around all of the ""hustle and bustle"" of a working studio!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalTourist85
50,"Great Tour, Really Interesting!",We had this tour included with our Go LA cards. We went on a Tuesday morning and the lot was busy with people working - it was great as we saw lots of people going about with costume rails etc. We even saw Quentin Tarantino!! The tour itself starts in the museum area which has loads of cool props from films! We also watched a film covering briefly the history of the studios. Our tour guide took us to many very interesting locations on the lot including a recording studio and where they film Jeopardy. I would definitely recommend this tour as there was lots of interesting things to learn and see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmsSher
40,Sony Pictures Tour,"We took the tour on a Friday afternoon and it was very easy to get in. The online reservation system is very helpful and let us know how many slots were open for each tour time. Because there were not a lot of bookings for the sound stages, we got to see some areas that are not normally on the tour. Jeopardy! and the Goldbergs were on hiatus, so we got to see those sets. The biggest thrill, for me, was being able to tour the Barbara Streisand Sound Stage, which is very frequently booked and not often part of the tour. It is in the oldest building on the lot and has very impressive acoustics. Just about every major motion picture soundtrack has been recorded there. All in all, the tour was a good value but considering that most studios have closed, you don't really have many options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sadams44
50,Fun Peek Behind the ScenesI,"The Sony Pictures Studio tour offers a different experience for each group. I get the impression that it can be hit or miss depending on what's available to view. For my family, this tour was a huge hit! We got to meet and chat with Donald MacDonald, a talented scenic painter who was happy to answer our questions. We also got to get up close with a painted background from the Sound of Music. We also got to stand in the kitchen of The Goldbergs (no photos) and learn more about the show. Our tour guide was Keith, who had a wealth of knowledge as an actor and LA native. A member of our tour group recognized Keith as a child actor from the 70s and 80s, and we enjoyed hearing some behind the scenes info. Our tour also included a visit to The Wheel of Fortune set, the studio museum, and history of the studio. I loved learning about how studios collaborate to rent space from each other and selling/renting sets and props, like the Oval Office. My teenagers enjoyed the tour as well. We all appreciated that it wasn't a scripted tour and we were free to ask questions. Tour was 2.5 hours. Wear comfortable shoes, all walking and some stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeftyGirlWisconsin
50,Best tour,"We had the best time on the Sony Tour with Keith Coogan as our guide. At the beginning they take your photo for a souvenir and give you a copy at no extra charge, which was nice. The prop are was really fascinating because we were able to see so many different shows and movies up close, really enjoyable. We were able to walk on the set of Goldberg‚Äôs which we absolutely loved! We saw the Jeopardy set and a lot of cool cars from different movies and shows like Breaking Bad. We enjoyed all of the stories Keith shared as well as seeing the backlots and sound stages. The store at the end is pretty small compared to other studios but they had some cool clothing although it was quite pricey.Definitely recommend, this was one of our favorites out of the four movie studio tours we did on Spring Break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ailra
30,Fun experience but...,"We were fortunate enough to do the Sony Pictures Tour, Warner Bros and Universal Studio Tour and this one ranked lowest. I‚Äôm glad we did this one first so we have nothing to compare it too. Our guide was great but there are limitation to what they could show us here. We were able to see the set of Wheel of Fortune but it was on hiatus so everything was covered to protect it. We were able to walk through real sets in Warner Bros and Universal. One plus was taking photos in the ‚ÄúSeinfeld‚Äù apartment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmq2000
30,Lots of sheds,"Our tour guide was fantastic and a real Holywood person, grandson of a famous star of the 30s. He brought everything to life as we toured the stages. Unfortunately, we only had his word to go on as the sheds/stages were all out of bounds and had to be viewed from outside as we looked at the exteriors of warehouses! He could have been talking in Slough but the weather was great.The small museum at the start of the tour was interesting and had lots of artefacts actually used in films. It would be more interesting if the films were rather more popular but teens may recognise more than their parents. The only sets we actually went on are for Wheel of Fortune (USA) which meant little to us, we did not know the presenters whose pictures were everywhere, apparently they are hugely popular, and the set of sitcom not shown in UK.All in all; the $50 each was only justified by the performance of the guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatHel7
10,"45 mins in, I was thinking it has to get better...but it didn't","i was really excited to go on a movie studio tour, but after 45 minutes, I was getting very disappointed and it didn't get better. The whole 2 hours was a waste and a waste of $50.They take you to their ""museum"" which has the set from Seinfeld and a few items from their movies, but I was done looking at everything within 5 minutes. From there, we did a lot of walking around the lot, but not seeing much. We saw the Jeopardy set, one TV show set, and four cars from movies. But other than that, we saw a lot of empty buildings and alleys between studios.For example, at point our tour guide told us one building held a giant pool where they film most water scenes, and I thought, ""Awesome! We're going to get to see that!"" but nope, we saw the outside of the building.The tour guide was also the worst I've ever had. He couldn't have been any duller if he tried. At one point, I almost started counting how many ""uhs"" ""ums"" ""likes"" he said in one minute (yes, that should tell you how bored I was) but kept up hope that he'd say something interesting at some point. But he didn't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lsimpson33
40,Worth visiting to see 3 sound stages,"Our tour visited the sound stages for Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, and The Goldbergs. It was fun to visit three active sets since most studios allow you to visit only one. I didn‚Äôt have high hopes for this tour given the negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The two hour tour flew by and it didn‚Äôt feel like too much walking. Overall, you are able to see several sound stages, hold a real academy award, receive a free souvenir photo, and get a good feel for what it‚Äôs like to work on a set. I‚Äôve been to 3 of the major studio tours and believe Warner Brothers is by far the best since you learn all aspects of the filmmaking process and see many exterior/interior sets, Sony Pictures is the second best since you see several sound stages, and Paramount is the worst since you see the least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apriladventures
40,Fun and Active,"We did the tour hour tour and, as advertised, it was all walking through various studio sets. It was fun to walk around such a bustling and active setting. Unlike the Warner Brothers Tour that had more movie sets, this tour included visiting the Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy sets as well as a few others. The tour includes some mini-museums and artifacts that served as fun surprises. I was glad we went and I‚Äôd say it was worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FEN_10
40,Interesting tour,The tour was well organized and I happened to be there on a day when it was a relatively small group with just 10 of us. At about two hours long it was the perfect length and you see a lot and as it's a walking tour there's not a lot of standing around but nor do you feel rushed. There was a movie being filmed while we were there with big stars so that was exciting and Jeopardy was taping as well. The guide Kevin was great and very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2012brendar
50,Take this tour and enjoy! It's simply AMAZING!,"This was our 1st Studio tour and it was AMAZING! The guide (former actor and Ghostbusters fan), was simply the best guide, showing us around, explaining so much stuff then keeping my wife and I for an extra 30 minutes to take pictures of us (since it was a bit rushed in the beginning and I wanted a picture of all the Spider-Man stuff, and more)! It wasn't actually rushed, it was because I wanted to see and absorb everything! From the set of Seinfeld, to the set of Wheel of Fortune, this walking tour was simply FUN! I recommend it and bring lots of memory for your pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie
50,What a blast!,"This tour was great! Not only did I become a fan girl because our tour guide is a STAR; but, we also were able to see some incredible and interesting things! Sound Stages, Sets of shows that are on tv right now, memorabilia! It was fantastic! Our tour guide was none other than Keith Coogan and he was excellent! You could tell how much he loved his job and showing off his wonderful studio!So, if you go, make sure you're on his tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunonaBudget2017
20,Fairly boring. Not worth 50 dollars,"It may be because we are not American but Norwegian, but we found this tour fairly boring. The highlight was the Jeopardy set, and another TV show we have never heard of. Otherwise we were mostly shown the outside of stages and told which films had been filmed there. More than 15 minutes were used on finding a restroom and visiting it. We were shown two short films, about the studio and about Jeopardy, which should be unnecessary on a live guided tour. The soundstage was fun to have seen. The small prop museum at the beginning was - well, small.We would recommend not going here but choose one of the other studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbekwet
40,Very good depending on what you like.,"We did this and the Warner brothers tour. Yes the Warner brothers tour is longer and more popular but Sony is worth a visit too. Especially if you‚Äôre into the shows and films that were shot there.For seinfeld, they have the apartment set in the museum. Breaking bad, there‚Äôs the RV. The ghostbusters vehicles. And my favourite part was the Goldbergs set which is one of my favourite shows. This isn‚Äôt on every tour as on filming days you can‚Äôt go on it but we got lucky that they weren‚Äôt filming the week we went!So do your research and if there‚Äôs something of interest to you there, definitely go!Also, using a Go Los Angeles card makes a big difference if you‚Äôre planning to visit multiple attractions in LA and saves you money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danniranger
50,Great tour,"I was a little hesitant to go on this tour after reading some of the reviews on here. But I was very happy we did this tour. Our guide, Dave, did a great job in keeping people interested. We got to see the Wheel of Fortune set, The Goldberg's set(double plus because we watch the show), and got into The Barbara Streisand recording stage area (fortunately for us, no one was using it on the day we toured). The acoustics in the stage area are phenomenal. Overall, I do believe this is a tour worth taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bashfulliz
40,Worth it if you have a LA GO card.,"The parking is free, just make reservations. You can park yourself or have a valet park it. You will have to go thru metal detectors so leave that stuff in the car. Cameras are permitted, most of the tour is exterior so most photos are okay. If someone tells you that you can't they probably don't know. The guide will tell you when not to but since you won't be seeing actual filming odds are you are good to go. Didn't see any stars but the guide mention the Goldbergs never saw the show but knew the faces. Later in the day we ate at the Farmers Market guess who I saw two tables down Jeff Garlin. The tour does need more movie props or exterior film sets to visit. I have now been to all the studio tours. If you have a Go Card it's a good place to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep146
40,"Interesting tour, small group","We enjoyed the Sony tour, which was smaller than the other studio tours we attended. It was a walking tour and I think there were about 10 participants, so it was easy to ask questions of the guide. Our guide, David, was a lot of fun to listen to, including having interesting side stories. One man on the tour had some kind of difficulty that held the group back a bit- David was able to redirect the group and keep us engaged, and avoided embarrassing this unfortunate man. There is an interesting museum with a Seinfeld set (among other things) that was fun to take photos in. There's also a small gift shop. Valet Parking in the ramp was a nice touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DH442
50,Enjoyable Visit,"Visited Friday morning with the Go LA Pass. Our tour guide did a great job and showed a sincere passion for the business. Appreciated the free valet parking and free picture. Tried to schedule a tour with the other rival studio (WB) and found them to be inflexible and only offering afternoon tours with the Go LA Pass (which were already unavailable) very much appreciated the flexibility of Sony Studios as we changed our reservations three times. Good job Sony, shame on the other guys. Would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757markv
40,Good for what it is,"I wasn't sure if I should go here based on the mixed reviews. Based on my love of TV shows and film, I thought it was worth seeing, and my expectations were certainly met. I don't think this tour deserves the bad rap some of the reviews show here, but I also don't think the tour is something I would do again here...not true of Paramount and WB, which I would probably do over and over again on future trips. I wish Sony would give nod and mention to the MGM past because some of the greats came from here.As reference, I went to Paramount and WB as well. If you can only go to one of the three studios, I would pick either Paramount or WB. If push came to shove and I had to pick Paramount or WB, I guess I would go with Paramount, but both are pretty comparable. The Sony tour is all walking. You ride in a cart most of the time for Paramount and WB. If you have mobility issues, then WB is probably best for you as you seem to stay in the cart the most there. I enjoyed the Sony tour, but just enjoyed these other two studios more.Traffic advice: If you are in the Burbank area and driving here near rush hour times, plan for LOTS of extra drive time. I allotted 1.5 hrs for a 0.5 hr drive and got there 5 minutes before tour departure. The 405 highway is a nightmare!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyj466
20,Disappointed,Didn't see much other than the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune sets but both were not set up. Even the gift shop where the tour ends was quite empty! Paramount's tour is much better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/438celiab
10,Poor customer service.,"Website ticket purchase confirmation was for wrong date (only in CA for less than 1 week). But plenty of spots still open for correct date. I tried to fix immediately (less than 5 minutes after purchase).No ability to make changes on website.No abilty for after hours (5pm) telephone coverage service to make changes.Next day, regular staff did not respond to email messages or return voicemail left the previous night.By the time I got a human on the phone, all the remaining slots for my week were booked. The Sony employee refused to cancel & refund purchase, even with weeks remaining to resell the slots for a tour that regularly sells out....Ended up taking Warner Brothers tour (Highly recommended).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmycrackcornan2018
30,SONY is so so,"It's a matter of perspective. Having been on the Warner Brothers Tour, this one is average in comparison. Not that walking was an issue, but while we stood outside buildings, they told us what took place in those buildings. Yes, we went into a few and got in the actual studio where they tape Jeopardy and The Goldbergs. I understand every day the tour is a little different, based on what may or may not be available at the time. We did have reserved tickets for Wheel of Fortune taping in the afternoon (saw 3 shows), unrelated to the tour, and that was a highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanes130
50,Great tour!,"I really enjoyed my Sony Studio tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and really knew the amazing history of this landmark location--which included MGM, Columbia before it became part of Sony. There is a very interesting small museum area at the start of the tour which included props from Seinfeld and other movie and TV productions. This is a walking tour so be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes. The tour covers a number of film sets and sound recording studios. I especially enjoyed seeing some of the Ghostbuster vehicles and the old beat up RV from Breaking Bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobca1947
50,WHEEL OF FORTUNE TAPING,"I wish there was a separate Wheel of Fortune Taping Review because I had questions prior to heading to Sony. I wondered about dress code-there is no dress code, wear what you want! Remember to call 5-7 days prior to your taping day to confirm your show tickets. Taping started at 12noon for us, we had to be there about 11:45am. The set/room was so cool!! We watched 2 whole shows get taped then had to leave for a sporting event. They had no problem with us leaving early. Had we stayed, it probably would have been done around 2/2:15pm. In between tapings we got to ask Vanna questions which was really neat. To enter the Sony complex you enter at the gate on Overland Ave. We had a blast watching the show get taped, so much fun!!! Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richellen_13
50,Ignore the haters - it is as good as Warner Bros,"After doing Warner Bros tour 4 times over 10 years it was time to try something different. Was almost put off by very mixed reviews but have no regrets.Sony tour is lower cost and provided free valet parking right at your desk.Main difference to Warner tour is that Sony is all walking rather than riding the buggy. Guide was great and able to answer plenty of questions.Tour highlights include the museum, Seinfeld apartment, Breaking Bad, Jeopardy set and historic sound stages (eg: Wizard of Oz).Your preferred tour will depend on what your interest is. For example, if you are a mad Big Bang and Friends fan then Warner Bros would be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
50,Best of the studio tours,"While this tour was walking and Paramount and WB were riding in golf carts, this tour was the best. We got to go onto an actual shooting stage, a Foley (sound) theater, and more. PLUS, the actual Ghostbuster cars and actual SUV and RV from Breaking Bad! It was awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SevyLevy
50,Very Cool!,"I did a tour at the Sony Pictures in January. What a grear experience. They still have a lot of exhibits from old films that they made, such as Ghostbusters, 22 Jump Street, Breaking Bad and the list goes on. You also see the headquarters office of Happy Madison.We were able to see from far, Director Ron Howard, which I was totally bummed to not be able to meet.Price was very reasonable and they give you a lanyard as a souvenir to keep. I definately recommend you going to see this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLeB325
20,Needs a lot of work to be competitive,"The venue itself is difficult to find and access. We had to reschedule our originally scheduled tour because we were late for our booking. The location listed on our tickets was NOT the location for the entrance to the studios. Very confusing, even for locals who were with us. No signage anywhere, no helpful instructions. We had to ask a random guard for directions and then walk 25 minutes around the block to find the unmarked entrance. At last...The tour itself... From the beginning, the experience is underwhelming. The tour is very poor - there's just nothing interesting to see, no current shows that are well-known, no history really. The tour guides were very nice and honestly they tried their best with the limited material given. The inclusion of the photo in the price of the ticket was a good addition because otherwise I'm not sure what we paid 50 bucks per head for.I'd recommend skipping this one and heading to Warner Bros studio tour instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/259katyab
10,Sony studios Tour,This tour sucked. My son left feeling cheated. Do the Warner Bros tour instead. $50pp was not at all worth walking the entire tour. Warner Brothers definitely set the bar high. Sony needs to revamp their entire tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950nakiaa
30,Good if you are a fan,"Unless you are a fan of the shows that are made here wheel of fortune or the goldbergs then i would choose the warner studio tour. The guides were excellent and reaaly did explain everything very well.The studios were all very busy which was good to see. However very little to see in terms of show props, breaking bad vehicles and ghostbusters being the few exhibits. The gift shop we couldnt really see as were rushed out but it didnt have much.I wouldnt go back which is unlike the studio tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735
50,Walking tour was a lot of fun for the entire family.,"Walking tour with our highlights of the Goldbergs' and the Wheel of Fortune sets, and Seinfeld's ""Jerry's Apartment"". Happy Madison productions is on the lot (did not see Adam Sandler) was fun to see. Overall a nice mix of today and past. Good tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6206DZginas
30,Former Home of MGM Lion Has Little to Roar About,"I've done the Warners, Paramount, and Sony tours, in addition to Universal (whose studio tour tram is half theme park attraction/half actual film tour), plus a private tour of The Walt Disney Studios. The Sony tour was the least exciting. Parts of it were interesting, but for the most part the other tours have this one beat.Prior to beginning the tour, groups wait in the parking garage and then go into a small museum. A photo is taken (which is included in the tour) and then the walking tour begins. We visited Wheel of Fortune and The Goldbergs which weren't taping at the time. Some of the studio history is interesting, as it originated as the MGM lot.If you're a movie buff and have done the other tours, you may like this to round out your experiences. However if you're deciding on taking only one tour - I'd stick with Warners or Paramount. The tour includes a stop at the studio store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
10,Don‚Äôt waste your time,"We visited Warner Bros., Sony and Universal while in LA. This tour was almost a joke. They start by telling you that there are actors there working and to be respectful of that. This is a joke. They walk you around outside of the buildings and do a lot of talking, about themselves, and continue to walk and talk. We did get to see a crazy woman go insane fan girl about Jeopardy. This may have been the most entertaining part of the tour. They skimmed by Adam Sandler‚Äôs office and didn‚Äôt even mention the iconic rainbow. Just horribly boring. Go to Warner Bros!! You WON‚ÄôT be disappointed!! Universal‚Äôs tour is part of the theme park, but is also amazing!! Sony was the worst part of our 11 day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O-H-I-Omcds
10,Save your money! Warner Brothers and Universal are so much better than this.,"In fairness we did the Sony Tour a day after the Warner Brothers studio tour so the expectation may have been elevated. The Warner Brothers tour was fantastic, organized, informative, and entertaining. The Sony tour was none of that. We basically walked around the lot and were told about things that were in buildings (now empty) at one point as we walked by them. Example outside of a large studio building our guide said ""Do you feel some wind? You might because Wizard of Oz was filmed here"". The building was now empty. He also mentioned that we would likely see some celebrities on our tour (which I found odd as I knew that certainly wouldn't be the case) and as proof he mentioned that Lea Thompson (the mom from Back to the Future) once joined a tour group. Wow! Warner Brothers allowed us to view actual working sets while the most we got to see at Sony was a broken down Wheel of Fortune, and Jeopardy set. By the end we were so glad it was over so we could leave. Just awful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dustinm603
50,Excellent Tour,I was worried it would be too much walking but it really wasn't. We got to see live studios and sets. Tour guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely a must do when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begley071902
10,Worst tour ever,"Boring, uninteresting, over priced, and couldn't wait for it to be over!! GO TO WARNER BROTHER' S INSTEAD, the best tour in Hollywood!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneCP
50,Keith is a great tour guide!,"Wee visited with our 93 year old and in a wheelchair. It was easy to push her around and get her into the various parts of the tour. We really enjoyed this tour, but realize this is a working Studio, and not a typical tourist attraction. You could take the tour several times and see different things, because it depends upon the schedule at the studio. We were able to see the set of Wheel of Fortune, The Goldbergs, and the Barbra Streisand recording studio. You are not allowed to take pictures in the latter two. They were filming Shark Tank, and we did see Mark Cuban. You get a nice souvenir photo as part of your tour. The only disappointing part was the gift shop. My aunt really wanted something from Wheel of Fortune, and there just wasn't much to pick from. The tour is a little expensive, but probably in line with all the other tourist attractions in the area. I would recommend this tour to see how a real working studio is run! And cross your fingers that you get Keith as your tour guide!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurdueGirl84
50,Notre Dame Student Films,"I was here for a fantastic night hosted by the University of Notre Dame!Of course, people from Notre Dame tend to be the most sincere, humble, and personal people you‚Äôll find.This night was no different and the students and alumni films were incredible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4288XBdavep
40,A must see IF you have a Go Card and are passionate about TV and Film,"Reading the reviews on here, we were a bit worried whether this would be any good but we really enjoyed it. We had a Go Los Angeles Card because we wanted to see Universal and Warner Bros and essentially the pass pays for itself if you want to see those two things - we therefore had this tour essentially for free.This is more ""real"" than Universal or Warner Bros as they are not setup for mass scale tourism. This is a working studio and isn't geared for anything more than a walking tour making it less staged.You start with them taking a souvenir photo for you but unlike everywhere else in LA - they actually give this to you at the end of free - no catch!You then see a small museum which we loved - it had a replica ""Seinfeld"" set that you could take photos on, as well as various memorabilia from films such as ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""Jumanji"", ""Passengers"", ""Short Circuit"".We then saw a small video before walking to the ""Wheel of Fortune"" studio where we saw inside. We then walked and saw the inside of ""The Goldbergs"" set. We also got to see a working Foley Set (this is where they make sounds such a footsteps or doors closing which are then added to the final film/tv soundtrack).All in all - a real great insight into a working studio. However, it isn't worth $50 which is basically the same price as Warner Bros - where you get to see a lot, lot more. Saying that - it is worth going if you have it for free as it is a great insight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravellerfromGB
50,Loved our Sony tour,"While we were in California for vacation, we toured Sony, Warner Bros. and Universal Studios. All three were different experiences, but I thoroughly enjoyed our Sony tour. As opposed to the other two, Sony is a complete walking tour, which I liked because you could stop and look in the individual studios rather than riding by on a tram. Our guide, Keith ""Coogan"" Mitchell was excellent. I wished I'd realized who he was before we left because I liked his movies back in the '80s (Adventures in Babysitting, Toy Soldiers, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead). Obviously he knew a lot about the industry and was very informative. My favorite part of the tour was visiting the set of The Goldberg's. We love that show and it was so cool to actually walk through their ""home"" where it's filmed. We had the LA Go Card to visit a variety of places around L.A. and we had no issues using it for this tour. We even called ahead and scheduled our visit, which I suggest doing. Great studio tour and I highly recommend it to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffK_12
30,Good tour,This an interesting place to go. We got a free tour as we live in Culver City. Saw the set for jeopardy and many films.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shidifu53
10,$50 dollars wasted,"$50 for this is not money well spent. You wait in a multi-storey car park and are guided by a disinterested tour guide who gives the impression he would rather be somewhere else. You go to a poor quality museum of average films, watch a brief film about the studio, see a trailer of a new film and then go through a few delapidated warehouses. We went to the sets of 2 TV series that are not shown outside the USA and therefore of no interest to foreign visitors and finished off in an overpriced gift shop. If Sony want to carry on offering a tour they need to up their game and value their visitors more. The only thing we leant is that blocker buster movies can be made in a dump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martin081160
40,Interesting walking tour of a major studio,"The $50/person Sony Picture Studio Tours run M-F at 9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 2:30 p.m. Additional tour times are added during peak seasons. Start your two-hour walking tour by posing in front of a blank screen for a complimentary photo of your group. After having your picture taken, spend some time exploring their small Museum, which is one of the few places on the tour where taking pictures is permitted. They have props and costumes from many movies and a life-sized set for the Seinfeld apartment. Next, we watched a short movie about the history of the studio. On the ‚Äúno pictures‚Äù part of the tour, you get to see or walk through several idle sets; ‚ÄúThe Goldbergs‚Äù, ‚ÄúWheel of Fortune‚Äù, and the Foley artist studio. They were making ‚ÄúCaptain Marvel‚Äù on another sound stage that is normally on the tour, therefore we missed out on seeing that one. There were only a handful of steps to climb on our tour, so it was not too physically challenging. Our tour guide was a fast talker and shared a lot of details about what was required to produce movies and TV shows. This may not be the best studio tour in the city, but it was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road_Warrior32034
50,Get your 'steps' with a fun look into Sony past and present.,Quick peek behind the scenes for any movie or television fan. You can see some current game show set-ups and also get a snapshot of the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jannineseymour
50,Fun and entertaining,"This is a fun way to collect information of how the movies are made, with a guide per group, you can see the studios, the technology and the history of part of the films industrySo, go and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyG76
30,Decent but not the best,"We had the LA Go Pass, so this tour was an included attraction. The tour starts out with a short film before you spend 10-15 minutes in a movie props museum. As someone who isn't as interested in this, I was bored. Then we walked around the studio and saw the set of Jeopardy and The Goldbergs which were the highlights of the tour. The majority of our time was walking between sound stages though, where our guide walked ahead of us and we weren't allowed to take any pictures. The tour ended at a unimpressive gift shop where they only sold overpriced shirts.This was our first studio tour on our trip so at first I thought it was really neat, however, after visiting Warner Brothers my thoughts changed. I would have been disappointed had I spent $50 on this tour, but since it was on the Go Pass I didn't mind as much. If you can only choose one studio tour in LA though, I wouldn't recommend this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtraveler07
40,Fun tourist stop.,This was fun but it's not mandatory. If you are close by then definitely stop in. I thought Warner Brothers and Universal Studios were a bit more interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
50,Great inside and historical view of the studio.,"Allison was a great tour guide. We are old Hollywood fans, and the history associated with this historical movie studio (formerly MGM Studios) was the real reason we were there. You learn about the history of the studio as well as see the current movies and tv shows. We got to go on to the sound stage for The Goldbergs and Wheel of Fortune, but the best (for us) was when Allison personally showed us The Thalberg Building ‚Äî leftover from the old MGM days. This is a whole walking tour, but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dce4529
50,Really good,The studio tour is excellent. The tour guide was magnificent and the tour was very informative and would recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthew122777
30,Not the best but good enough,"This was the first of four studio tours we went on. It was impressive until we experience some of the others. In my opinion paramount was the best, follows by the tour at Universal (VIP experience), then Sony, and the worst for our trip was Warner brothers. Much like some other studios there was filming on certain sound stages rendering it unavailable for the day. The tour guide we had (so unimpressive I don‚Äôt recall his name) tried to make it sound more enticing than it was saying that there was ‚Äútop secret projects‚Äù being worked on. We viewed a museum first for about 15-20 mins before being shown a film about the studio. After that we were taken to 2 sound stages one for wheel of fortune and one for another show. We also got to see many back lot facades and cars from various movies and this was the only tour to show us a working Foley stage. The best way to describe this tour compared to others is ‚Äúunderprepared‚Äù there seemed to be many minor details that the tour office has not worked out yet. Also, our tour guide had one moment that on my opinion took away his credibility. During the Foley stage portion of the tour, he began to explain about a famous sound used from previous works that is not recreated. He forgot the name of the sound and proceeded to pull out his phone and google it in the middle of the tour. Maybe in a few years I will return to give them another chance and see if the tour improves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbarnes16
10,Go to Paramount Studios or Warner Brothers this is a rip off.,"Paid for a 2 hour tour. 90 minutes is not 2 hours. You see next to nothing and are told virtually nothing from the bored and uninterested tour guide. I've heard if you get Kevin it's good but what are your chances? The only good thing is we got on the set of ""The Goldbergs"" since they are on hiatus. The Jeopardy set has a brief film by Alex Trebek and there is another film at the beginning of the tour that goes about 15 minutes (which is interesting) but a film is a film, not a tour. Then you get 15 minutes in a crappy gift shop. So 2 hour tour minus 30 minutes (cut short) minus another 30 minutes of film and gift shop leaves 1 hour. I could have given a better tour and I'm not boasting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baxterthetravelguy
30,"Good, not great","We had the Go City Card so this was included. We would have been upset if we had paid extra for it. Our tour guide was great, there just wasn‚Äôt much to see on the tour. You see a lot of big buildings where shows were filmed, but you only get to to inside a couple. We got to see the sets for Wheel of Fortune and The Goldbergs but we were not allowed to take pictures. It‚Äôs just not a well put together tour. We much preferred the Warner Bros. Studio Tour and the tour offered at Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142miriaml
40,Fun Tour at a Studio With a Rich Heritage,"The last time I was walking these lots was in 1984, when we at Ford were introducing a brand new vehicle called the Taurus. We did so in the sound stage used by ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù. In those days it was the home of MGM - today it is the home of Sony Entertainment (which also absorbed Columbia Pictures). At Sony, there is a good mix of nostalgia and current fare. Yes, you can learn about Judy Garland, Rita Hayworth and other past stars. But they are also currently shooting ‚ÄúThe Goldbergs‚Äù and other contemporary fare. We had a great guide, Keith, the grandson of early film star Jackie Coogan. He got us into the set of ‚ÄúWheel of Fortune‚Äù, the Foley Stage, etc., etc. It was a walking tour - no carts or buses - but we were good with that. If you liked ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù or ‚ÄúGhost Busters‚Äù, this is also the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwD7057IG
30,Small intimate tour but saw very little...,"Used the GoCity card to book this trip, quick and easy to complete that. Tour walks past many sound stages and we could look briefly in from the door but one really doesn't see much that way, just the wooden backs of sets. Any person who lives for seeing Wheel of fortune or/and Jeopardy will love the tour because those are the main stops. We also saw a Foley sound artists set. We moved past various stages however since Goldbergs was taping, we could not enter anything. Having experienced so much more from Warner studios tour and the Universal Tour, this wasn't a tour I felt much from other then an appreciation of the work of a foley sound artist. A lot of walking, not much seeing. Very polite and friendly guide though and free parking though tipping the valet is appropriate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raykidz
50,Loved the tour!,small group tours for $45 per person lasts about 2 hours and you get to see and hear about a lot of film history. Highlight was the studio sound room where the film scores are recorded. Also saw the set for Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0raas
50,Awesome low key tour,"Columbia pictures merged with TriStar Pictures, eventually becoming Sony Pictures, and eventually moving to the old MGM studios.... I think I got that right. Confused? Well, this tour explains it all to you! It was a fantastic tour, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. MK was a great guide, and he gets two thumbs up from these guys! Best part...obviously the Ecto-1!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
50,Sony VIP tour was everything we wanted,"We took the Sony PIctures VIP tour, and loved it. We had an individual tour guide for just the two of us, and the tour included an excellent lunch. Even more importantly, our guide Michael was passionate, and knowledgeable, about film and loved talking to us about the behind the scenes details that make movies and TV even more fascinating. He was a real gem. Sony has put a lot of money into renovating the site, and it shows, relative to the Warners and Paramount tours. Highly recommended if you love film. With such an intimate, small group, you will get more out of it if you participate in the discussion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryR573
50,Best tour ever!!,I have been through the Sony tour twice and LOVED each time. Very small intimate group so everyone feels like they have a personal tour guide. Went to a couple of different sets where they were not filming that day. Tour guide was very informative. Each time we got to see different things. GREAT TOUR!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladybug62
50,"This is a working studio folks, not an attraction.","We loved this tour. Keith was an absolute professional who shows his love, knowledge and experience in movies and production every step of the way. People who take this tour must understand, it isn't anything but a walking tour of a working film studio. You see things the way a person working on a set would see it. You learn a lot of back story, how the studio system used to work, and such.The Streisand Studio was incredible, for a second you can picture yourself being a star recording in there. (Then you remember that you can't sing.)Do this tour if you want to see the past, present and future of film and television. Skip it if you don't like walking or need a lot of flash to pay attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cktraveloptions
20,Disappointing,"What a disappointment. The tour is basically a walk around the Sony grounds with a tour guide pointing out the studios where things were filmed. The exteriors are plain square warehouses. Half of the tour was looking in a small museum of props, the gift shop and watching a short movie about the studio. The highlights were visiting the set of the Goldbergs and wheel of fortune. For $47 per person I certainly expected to see more. Would not recommend this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianedS2987OF
10,Disappointing & Tragically Unloved By The So-Called Guides ....,"Firstly you are leaft to wait in the ground floor of a car park which was decidely shaky and un-nerving to say the least... Then when the tour begins you are literally shoved from one boring stage to another with absolutely no enthusiasm by a pair of staff who have no interest in the history of the studios, taken to pointless areas of the lot with no relevance to the rich history and epic films that have been made on its amazing grounds... The only highlight was seeing a brief glimpse of Danny Glover ..... MISS THIS TOUR AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME DOLLARS & POINTLESS WALKING !!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christiancA8803PU

30,"Nice tour, but could be much much better","Way worse than Warner and Paramount (but also less expensive). The really annoying thing for us was that the stop at the studio store/restrooms/yoghurt shop is really short (approx. 15 minutes) and you can enjoy almost nothing. We would have liked to have time to spend in the shop, have a seat outside eating a yoghurt, etcetc... Also, the visits at the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune sets take a huge percentage of the time you spend in the studios. If you aren't really interested in these shows it's a huge waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guybrush79
50,INTERESTING AND WORTH IT WALKING TOUR WITH KEITH!,"When my daughter and I checked in, I recognized the person behind the counter, but could not put his name with his face. When we began our tour, Keith gave us all kinds of information regarding each Studio and what was filmed there. Just think, the Wizard of Oz, Castaway, and many other Classic Movies from the past. Yes, you have to walk, but learning about how movies are made, knowing that these great actors past and present are about, still remembered. Not forgotten! Keith opened up a whole new world for us when we watch movies now. Seeing the sound stage that was built long ago, and still can not be duplicated in sound. Knowing Barbra Streisand sang there. Also knowing that other singers rent the space because of the fantastic sound that can be achieved for their albums, you just can't understand until you step inside. At the end of the tour, we finally figured out who Keith was. So we asked him and YES we nailed 2 of the characters he played in the 80's. Adventures in Babysitting and Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead! Keith informed us that he loves his job with Sony and that was obvious to us! We recommend that if your a movie lover, check this out!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretchenw641

10,Not Worth It..tour of empty buildings . Use your imagination,"We were expecting a tour with more features then the Universal Tour, sadly tired feet and disappointment. Walked the whole tour looking looking inside empty studious, we were asked to imagine the filming that occurred in the empty building. We saw a empty recording studious and once again had to use our imagination. The only concrete thing we saw was the studio where Jeopardy is filmed, and few vehicles used in movies. Did not see and filming if anything, just walked behind tour guide and used our imagination. The studious did nothing to add any excitement to the tour. My family and I could not wait until it was over. I think the tour would of been better with if we stayed home and just us ed our imagination . The bonus was buying gifts from gift shop, they on course do not place your items in a bag unless you buy the bag, walked around with purchases in our hands. Do your self and your family a favor and go to universe or even Warner Brothers tour, Sony Studious has no interest in offering you any excitement just aching feet. The whole tour a very annoying man kept asking the tour guide stupid questions, and bragging about his knowledge. Can't believe we drove 31/2 hours from San Diego for this pathetic cheap tour offered by billion dollar industry, Shame on You Sony. Please do all of us a favor, stop offering these tours or invest some money into these tours, empty warehouses and imagination did not excite anyone. Fancy I'd cards you gave us, must of broken your $10 budget.üò°üò°üò°üò°",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shane769
20,Go to Warner Bros tour twice before going here...,"We did the Warner Bros tour last year, so thought we would try another. Fairly disappointed it has to be said. The tour guide did her best, but unless you lo Wheel of Fortune (what?) or seeing the outside of a sound stage, then probably best to stay clear. Nearly $200 I wish I had spent somewhere else...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy_Camper405
50,Authentic studio walking tour,"We took the Sony, Warner and Universal tours on the same trip, so we experienced the gamut. Of the the Sony one is the cheapest, shortest and least productized. Unlike the other two it‚Äôs a pure walking tour through a working studio, and other than a tiny gift shop nothing is setup for the purpose of the tour. There are no rides, no trams, etc. In that sense, it was easily the most authentic tour experience. Also, our tour guide had been in the industry for 40 years since he was a child actor and came from a family of actors. And he seriously loved the industry and it‚Äôs history so you could tell he held the places we went with sincere reverence which rubbed off. Sony is on the historic MGM lot, so the history goes way, way back. We stood in the sound stages where Wizard of Oz was filmed and even saw the place where the witch popped up from the floor. We walked through the recording stage where so many Oscar winning scores were performed. Etc.The main downside of the Sony lot/tour is that they many decades ago sold off all their historic backlots, so with a tiny, unremarkable exception there are no outdoor scenes to go through and the kids really liked that about both other tours. The kids also liked the trams and less walking of the other tours though that didn‚Äôt bother me.The tour is approximately 2 hours. There‚Äôs a 15 minute movie to give you context for the history of the studio and a brief break at the gift shop. They try to walk onto current sets, including if possible either Jeopardy (which we did) or Wheel of Fortune. We also walked through the set of the Goldbergs, actually walking through the house itself.My kids ranked the other tours better. As someone who likes real history and less commercialization, this was my favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonSt
50,If you like movie industry history ... do This Tour!!,"I got chills when standing in the sound room, a few feet from where Judy Garland sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow for the Wizard of Oz, and John Williams recorded the Star Wars soundtrack, and where so many legendary scores were recorded.I was privileged enough to stand in the world's largest sound stage, where the Wizard of Oz was created and filmed. So many screen legends have crossed the same paths you'll walk on this tour it's inspiring!Our tour guide himself, Actor Keith Coogan (Adventures in Babysitting), has an acting family history with the studio beginning with his Grandfather (Jackie Coogan, one of the first child actors in film history and inspiration for Coogans Law).The tour was very dynamic with our tour guide checking each step to see what was open and available to bring guests through. We visited the sets of Wheel of Fortune, The Goldbergs, something in the works (Marvel I think). We saw historic sites such as Lucille Ball's dressing room, etc.So far we (our family) has been to tours of Universal, Warner Brothers, Paramount and now Sony and I must say ... this was the most interesting yet.Highly recommended!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chucks-World
30,Good Studio Tour,"We visited the Sony tour last week and would say it's well worth a visit if you're interested in TV/Film but it wouldn't be as good as Warner, Paramount or Universal tours.Firstly our tour guide Keith was great and friendly and definitely a big plus on the tour. As an actor he had great character and some interesting stories.The problem with this tour is that its mainly walking through the front lot pointing at buildings of what has been filmed there. There isn't much of a back lot here which I always find the most interesting part of the studio tours.I enjoyed looking round the props and Sienfield set at the start of the tour and felt we could have stayed longer here. As a fan of The Goldbergs it was also great going into one of the sets. Plus another plus was seeing the Breaking Bad and Ghostbusters cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xLondoner1980x
50,Mother & Daughter trip,We enjoyed this tour. Didn't realize it was all walking but it wasn't a bad walk even after 4 days at theme parks. Enjoyed learning all the shows and movies made on that lot. Actually walking into the studios was a great added touch. Our tour guide was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/182mariag182
40,Great studio tour,Really enjoyed my trip to Sony Studios recently. Our tour guide was very informative and friendly. It's fascinating to be able to go into a working sound stage and see how a TV show or movie is made. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo
40,A real tour of a working studio - and even more closeby,"We took the tour at Sony Studios after looking at all of the other tour options. While I can't compare to the others, I will say that this tour is worth the cost and the time.First, we had a terrific tour guide. Keith has a lot of experience as an actor himself and shared several fun stories. Thanks Keith!The tour itself lasts about an hour and a half. It is all walking, but it is flat and not really that far or strenuous. The guide takes you through a couple of sets. Note though, that these will vary depending on what is filming at the time. We saw Jeopardy and the Goldbergs, which was great, but were unable to see Wheel of Fortune and others as they were prepping to film.The coolest part about this tour is that this is a real working studio. This is not a fake, staged thing. There are workers walking around everywhere, and the guides say that it is not uncommon to see actors milling about as well. (We didn't see any though).At the end, you get a nice picture of your group which is included in the price.All in all, the Sony tour is a good value to see the real life and work behind the scenes.TIP: Sony is located in Culver City, which is also the site of many of the homes that are used in movies/tv. Just Google ""Address of (favorite show) house"" and you will see if there is a real house that is used for the show. The Goldbergs house for example is not too far from the studio. Also, the house from Fresh off the Boat is closeby.Just remember to be a good neighbor when you visit, because these are not movie sets - they are real houses with real people living there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrVille
20,Not worth a visit,"We toured Warner Brothers, Paramount, and Sony whilst on holiday in LA. Sony in my opinion was easily our least favourite. Considering the amount of history behind the studio we were expecting a bit more to view.Firstly the reception is at the car park?? Oh yes very welcoming for us tourists eh?The tour itself seemed rushed and I expected more than ""here are the stages where Wizzard of Oz was made"". Really???? They look like 2 warehouses to me.When the tour finished it was ""right folks you have 10 minutes to use the bathroom and visit the gift shop and then it's back to the exit"". Emm don't bother thinking about having a rest or a coffee after your 2 hour walkabout because Sony want you off the lot asap.Highlight of the tour was the sound room and the music stage.I got the impression that a tour of this Studio is more of an inconvenience for the owners rather than an interesting attraction. Overall I could have read all about the studio before the tour and not have bothered wasting my money.Other studio tours provide more for your buck so you would be advised to try them instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raheny11
30,Other Studios show more,"On our vacation, we toured Warner Brothers, Paramount, and Sony. Sony was easily our least favorite. Was it cool? Absolutely. But did they do nearly as much as the other studio tours? Absolutely not.WB and Paramount take you around in a cart while Sony makes you walk in the blazing sun for 2 hours. Yes it's nice to walk and see things up close, but WB and Paramount let you get off numerous times as well.Also, the sets we went on for WB and Paramount were fully set up and working sets like Ellen and Dr Phil. The stages were set up like the show. Sony...we walked into a broken down Wheel of Fortune set as well as a broken down Goldberg's set. It literally looked like when you buy a new house and there are tarps covering the wall. For the money we spent, I would expect to see a set like the other studio tours all set up.Thirdly, as a side note, there is a girl working for Wheel of Fortune...I wish I got her name but I didn't. One of the most snobby and stuck up pieces of work I have ever come across. We saw a taping there the other day (which was really cool by the way), but one of the girls (probably late 20s early 30s with blonde hair), was so nasty to us. I can't even type out on here how she was talking to us. She probably got the job there because she's somebody's daughter because she surely couldn't have gotten it for her personality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamaanders16
40,Great visit behind the scenes,First time to Sony tour. Was good although if your seeing a show in the afternoon i would choose a later tour so your not waiting around so much.Its a standard walking tour no surprises. Was busy so not inside allowed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coxpossum
40,Good studio,It's a decent studio. Rather small but has a lot of history behind it and they allow you to step onto current sets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TahirS188
30,"Exciting experience, but not the best tour","The Sony studio tour was exciting, as we were able to go onto a few sets and see some stages. I enjoyed the museum/room with all different artifacts and props from movies and tv shows. Our picture was taken in the beginning and then at the end we were given one copy of our photograph, for no additional charge. That was a nice surprise! This tour is about 2 hours and is all walking on foot with a tour guide and a group of about 20-25 people. Their store was slightly disappointing,as they didn't have that many souvenirs and items from TV shows and movies to purchase. It was neat to see different aspects and behind-the-scenes from Sony, but if you can only visit one studio, I'd definitely recommend Warner Brothers' Studio instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115trishe
50,Highly recommend,"This is a walking tour but was the BEST out of all the tours I did. Very small crowd, personalized, actually let you go in to places. If you like movies, this is a MUST.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6311CHjuliec
50,Great history behind the gate! A tour for real film and tv buffs.,"This isn't an ""amusement park"" tour. This is a working studio tour, and that's why I liked it. Our guide was a well-known actor who has appeared in many movies and television shows I was a fan of. He had so much material to share with us. We also go to see actual working sets of shows like The Goldbergs, which was fantastic. I mean, we LITERALLY walked through the Goldbergs house! How cool is that? Also got to see so many props and parts of sets from the past. Really well done. You learn a LOT on this tour. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the other tours have, but honestly, I wanted to learn more than be amused, and this was the perfect tour for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeff138
40,Nice Tour,"This tour is what the other tours were before they became so commercialized. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and fun. You got to see quite a few places on the lot and there was action going on the day that we were there. Part of your selection should be the shows that you are interested in. My wife likes Jeopardy and so this was a natural for us. We found out when we got there that Shark Tank films there too and they were in production the day we were there. Alas we didn't get to see any of the Sharks, but we saw their cars! I liked the fact that we were wandering around and not in a bus-like vehicle where we couldn't be trusted. The free picture is a cool souvenir as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sportsinfoguy
30,Interesting for some,Felt like a scald down WB tour. Yes had some flashy things like the green screens for batman and Harry Potter but really when you cannot take photos in sets it was a little disappointing. Got to go on the Goldbergs set which was the highlight for me. Tour guide was very informative. Wheel of fortune set was interesting but nothing special. No star to be spottedüòü. Interesting but not as personalised as the WB tour. I would still do both tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narpa01
30,Just okay,"I enjoyed the tour, and it was neat to walk on some of the sets and past some famous props, but I think the price is a little steep for what you actually see. The tour guide (Aaron?) was very friendly and knowledgeable and made the tour much better than it could have been. They were also very accommodating, as I got stuck in traffic and was 45 minutes late for my scheduled tour, but they still let me join the next available tour with no hassle. The best part of the tour was seeing all the artifacts in the museum at the beginning of the tour. It's a tour that's worth checking out as long as you know it's not going to be a thrill-a-minute adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
50,Great day out,"We were really torn on this trip based on previous reviews, especially being from the UK as a lot of reviews say that it is only relevant to people who watch American TV, however we really enjoyed the day.You get a souvenir lanyard and photo which I think is a really nice touch, we didn;t get this service ANYWHERE else on our trip so that was nice.Although some parts of the trip were specific to a particular TV show (Wheel of fortune features quite prominently), it was still a really good day, and the vehicles, set and information from the guide was really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295lob
20,Sorry we wasted our time,"We have taken other studio tours and this was a huge disappointment. I have to tell you it was neither informative or entertaining. Again sorry we wasted our time coming here,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CFL18
40,First time,Found out about this tour when we signed up to see Jeopardy being filmed...we did the 2.30 tour...we truly enjoyed the tour and it was nice that it wasn't part of a amusement park...there was lots of walking.....fast walking....i would not recomend this tour if you had a hard time walking or needed to sit...not really wheel chair accessible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandymccluskey1953
10,An elegant rip off,"Do not waste your time ""visiting "" these well painted buildings from the outside with the verbal support of a kind guide who tells you that in that building they filmed, a long time ago, some tv show or movie. Emphasis on Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, MIB, Spider-Man and The Goldbergs. Not very exciting. Go to the beach instead: you'll appreciate the fresh air free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZioDonny
30,Not a bad tour,"I had toured Warner Bros studios in the past so I had that to compare this tour to. Warner gets more in depth then this tour. Albeit for the price wasn't terrible but we didn't get to see as much in depth. We got to see the set of Jeopardy , Wheel of Fortune and The Goldberg's. Overall it was worthwhile but not as good as Warner Bros.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolves0991
50,Great tour!,"I was somewhat apprehensive about doing the Sony tour as the others (Universal and Warner Brothers) seemed to be more highly. But my son definitely wanted to do this one so we accommodated and it turned out great. Our tour guide was personable and shared tidbits throughout the tour that kept it interesting. We were able to see a replica of the Seinfeld set before starting. The studio was very busy that day with lost of people bustling around. We were able to walk onto the set for the Goldbergs and Jeopardy, as well as into the stage used for parts of the Wizard of Oz. The tour was very informative and interesting all the way through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfox517
50,Sony Pictures Tour,Joined this as part of our classwork. See posted photos to see highlights of the tour. I was able to get 10% discount for my Sony souvenir purchase.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodcrawlph
50,Very Interesting,"I really enjoyed being on the lot of a real, working studio. The tour begins independently in a space where you can look at movie and tv memorabilia. Then we watched a movie on the history of Sony Pictures/MGM. The rest of the time was on foot walking both outside and inside of stage buildings. Went into the set of Jeopardy and the Goldbergs. I would have loved to see more, but this was a short tour that gives a nice overview.Free Parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BiggerPassportPlease
40,Good fun!,"I have no point of comparison, but I enjoyed the tour. Guide was friendly and very knowledgable. We coupled with seeing taping of Jeopardy, which was great fun. Bit tricky to have to walk to lunch down the street on top of all the tour walking for some, but I rather enjoyed walking in nice LA weather!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parisusaparis
40,"A Nice View Historical and Current Film Work, but be prepared to walk, walk, walk, walk...","My wife & I are both seniors. We enjoyed seeing the historical studio lot where MGM used to reside (stepping inside Sound Stage 15 where Oz had been) and we REALLY enjoyed stepping into the sound stage dining room where the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs is filmed. The small museum at the beginning of the tour is nice, but time is limited there at the beginning of the tour (but I suppose you could go back before returning to the parking garage.) The main impression we left with was that the overall studio is much smaller as compared to that shown on the Warner Bros. tour we did some 12 years ago. And... much of the backlot viewing at WB is done while riding on a tram. At SONY you must walk everywhere, and walk a lot. (Rising steps are not a major factor, except if you want to go in and see the Jeopardy stage if it is available for tours that day.) What was interesting is that the youngish (30 something?) tour guide and the youngish tour group left us in the dust... and we could have wandered willy-nilly throughout the complex on our own until someone stopped us at a sound stage wearing our visitor passes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EwanderingMan
20,Big disappointment ‚òπÔ∏è,Took a tour of this studio and was greatly disappointed. It consists of walking past many buildings and being told that you either cannot go in due to filming or that they are done filming for the season . I think you should have this information prior to getting your ticket. The only studio we could enter was where they filmed Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune and you could see the many awards received as they were displayedSave your hard earned money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryannB7
20,Booooooring Tour of Nothing,"This walking tour takes you through the streets of the Sony studio, and is pretty boring overall. We did sit in the audience seats of the Jeopardy set and were on the set of The Goldbergs, but if neither of those shows excite you, then there was absolutely nothing else to get excited about. We went to Sony for Breaking Bad fun, but all we saw was the RV and some cardboard cutouts of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Warner Bros Tour was SO much better!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorianp928
50,Wheel of Fortune,Watched 3 filmings. Great fun and it is free! In fact all taping in LA are free. Don't let the street denizens sell you a ticket. Just go online and come early. Only 100 seats.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/382bruces
10,Terrible customer service,Phone number that just tell you to call again. Visitor center that don't help visitors. Avoid this attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9343SPlucasl
40,Wheel of Fortune taping,"Fairly easy to obtain tickets online, free parking in 7 story structure on Overland, staff was wonderful helping my mother who uses a walker, check in was easy peasy and seeing Wheel of Fortune live made the long drive worthwhile. The Studio Tour is on our ""to do"" list this year. Reservations are required for Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and the Studio Tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
50,Great Tour,"Great Experience! We were fortunate to get to see inside the Barbra Streisand Scoring Studio, one of the top two sound studios in the world and possibly the best for its acoustics, where the scores for countless great movies scores and recording artists have been recorded from Judy Garland recording the Wizard of Oz soundtrack to the greatest films today. Seeing the backlot and the sound stages, vehicles, and props was awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianhZ1918JJ
50,Visit to see taping of Jeopardy (my favorite show),"Requested tickets to see taping of Jeopardy. I walk with a cane and the staff, from front gate person to everyone involved with getting us to the taping was so friendly and considerate. Sonny, the person who drove us in the golf cart was so friendly and kind and took pictures of us posing inside at the jeopardy prop sets. Everyone we came in contact with made this experience over the top for me. I couldn't have imagined a better experience of seeing a taping of Jeopardy! A dream come true for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtlines
10,Do NOT Bother - such a disappointment,"I had nothing against the tour guide. Nice fellow seemed to know his stuff, but we literally walked around essentially a load of back alleys with nice cream painted walls and ""stage xx"" on them - saw both spectacular - everything that was pointed out was reference to dead people - nothing modern or current here to loo at - unless you are a jepodary fan - as an Australian - nope we don't even get it. Sorry I don't write harsh reviews but this was a walk with 20 people I dis. OT know - looking at basically nothing and it cost me $42 - hmmmm I did paramount last year thought it was brill - but cant comment 12 months on...l hope this helps someone xx",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charmayne72
50,great way to see behind the cameras,"my wife's first visit to a studio and she was impressed with what goes on behind the camera - how the sets are set up etc. i've been to a studio before but was still impressed with what we saw during the 2 hr tour. most impressive aspect was the free parking included in your studio pass - but it is also valet parking - what a deal. everyone we came in contact with was very helpful to make sure we got to the right spot for our tour, highly recommend this studio tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tndawoods
20,Sony Pictures Tour,"I would give this one a miss. You have to use a lot of your imagination just to remember the scenery from you favorite series and movies that are shot there, as the tour guide is explaining everything to you. There is very limited access to the recording sets, we only got to go to ""The Goldbergs"" set and everything else was related to us by the guide. Yes we are not allowed to take pics of the sets, but it would have been nice to see them as you see them on TV. The only highlight for me was being able to take pictures with the ghost busters mobile.Unfortunately it would have been an ok tour had I also not done the Warner Brothers tour, which was phenomenal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpho3105
50,Amazing if you like TV and movies!,"My family went here this past summer, and it was a blast! We got to go on the set of the TV show, ""The Goldbergs"" and it was so cool! We also got to go on the set of ""Jeopardy!"" and ""Wheel of Fortune"". We also get to see the rainbow that was in ""The Wizard of Oz""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorj348
50,Fun Tour,"We enjoyed the tour of the studio. The introduction movie was very interesting and informative. With a little imagination you can see the Hollywood magic of movie making. Being on the set of the Goldbergs was pretty amazing,as well as the Wheel of fortune set. It was over 2 hours and our guide was very amusing and energetic. If you like to see the inner workings of a studio this tour is for you. It is strictly a walking tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolanny109
50,A must if you into TVs shows,Sony studios is a great place to visit if your into your TVs shows. Firstly it's a walking tour that lasts about 2 hours make sure you take water with you. You get to go on the sets of some of the shows that there filming . And you get a comp photo at the end of the tour as a TVs fan it's a great tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duskman554
30,"Not a ""must see"", but still worth a visit if you have the time.","Having now taken all the major studio tours (Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony, and Universal), I'd say this ranks number 3 out of the 4. Still worth a visit if you have the time, but you're trying to select just one tour to take, I'd look more closely at either Warner Bros. or Paramount.The biggest difference with this tour compared with the others is that it's a walking tour. No riding around on a modified golf cart here. For me, I actually prefer walking around, as it makes it easier to take everything in. Unfortunately the tour guides are not on par with the other studio tour guides, at least not based on my experience. Whereas the tour guides at the other studios are interns looking to work their way up within the company, the tour guides at Sony do this as ""just a job"" as our guide explained to us. Young guys in their early 20's with untucked shirts. It just wasn't as polished or professional as the other tours. Still very interesting regardless though.My biggest recommendation regardless of which studio tour you choose to take however is to do your homework in advance, figure out and watch whichever shows are currently filming there, so that IF you get a chance to visit the sets, you recognize and can appreciate what you're looking at. Being at least somewhat familiar with the shows will make the experience that much more meaningful for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinDaveHead
50,Jeopardy Taping - a must-see show,"Visiting in the area? Go to jeopardy.com and reserve tickets for an upcoming taping. The experience for the show taping was terrific. We did NOT take the studio tour after the taping, as the taping experience itself - the Jeorpardy show - was in and of itself a terrific experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee
40,Interesting visit,Was walking around Culver city and I stumbled upon Sony picture. Went in to try and bok a tour but had to book for the next one which was in like 2 hours. Went had lunch and came back. The tour takes around 2 hours and they take you into the large studios and around the production houses. Its nice and if you spot a celebrity even better.. However everything sis obviously tightly controlled and well scripted. Didn't do Columbia so cant really compare,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loomi
50,Loved the tour,Have been on a few studio tours and this is the best yet. Right from the moment you walk into the building you are treated like a welcomed guest. Our tour guide was very friendly and knew his stuff. The lot was very clean. They give you a picture at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9868ENcindyp
50,Fun Tour.,Spent a fun two hour walking tour of Sony Studios. It is the old MGM studios. Very informative tour. Fun to see some of the sets.Went on the set of the Goldbergs and was amazed at the size of the set. Much larger than I thought. The great details of the set is amazing. Would definitely recommend this tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flhappy
50,Very interesting tour.,"We really enjoyed the tour, walking through The Goldbergs house was amazing. We have never seen the Masters of Sex show, but could still appreciate the effort that goes into getting the set as per the relevant time period. Being Australian the Jeopardy set didn't mean much to us, but was still interesting. Loved seeing the Ghostbusters cars and the bus from Breaking Bad. Tour guide was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howletts
10,Bad tour,"To start off, the tour guide started speaking early. We arrived on time and then we're grabbing a coffee in their lobby and the guide spoke sooo fast and refused to wait 1 min. The guide left to the movie room and we were told they would bring us back. Then the guide in the studio desk said that we would then have to wait and miss the entire vide because we are 1 min behind the group . This place is third rate studio tour. We have been to Paramount studio tour, Warner Brothers Studio Tour and Universal Studio Tour. All of these other studio tours made sure all the guests in the group were there, gave some time buffer and were able to accommodate a 5 min delay in the schedule.This tour is the worst for 40 dollars. Take your money to the other studios!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love_Farm_Animals
50,Sony Studio Tour,"Attended Sony Studio Tour. Best kept secret in Los Angeles if you really want to see how a movie studio works behind the scenes. There is no rides or tram, just a real studio lot..which you walk. Many Sony movies are made here like the new Ghost Busters movie. Many game shows are also taped here like Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1342HIjohnb
50,"Great combo of information, entertainment and stargazing","We has a wonderful tour of Sony Studios that gave us a chance to see most of the sets, the Barbara Streisand acoustic theater as well as meet a few stars, the best being Adam Sandler. Would definitely recommend this for anyone who has time in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262willt
50,"If you are a movie & TV fan, this is an informative & fun tour!!!","When I booked the Sony Pictures studio tour at a cost of $42 per person, I was a bit leery, thinking it might be overpriced. However, once on the tour, it was well worth it. If you enjoy movies & TV, it is amazing all the things Sony and Columbia Pictures have accomplished.Going into the world famous sound room was amazing, as well as the Foley sound area. It really is amazing to learn how movies are made & it's not as computerized as Ithought. We also got to see the Jeopardy studio & set for The Goldberg's TV show.This is a walking tour for about 2 hours, so wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCM2015-1
50,"Don't expect the Universal Studios experience, expect more!","We needed to find something to do to spend some time in West LA before dinner plans with friends. The day before I found this on Trip Advisor and got tickets.We arrived about 30 minutes beforehand but the show had already started. The lobby of the Sony office building was being ""converted"" into a mall for a filming of The Goldbergs, which is why I thought there was mall attached to the building. Signs for ""mall security"", and various store fronts were all around. Naked manikins were being dressed in store windows. Racks of clothing were ready for ""placement"". Lighting gear was all around.Then the real tour began. We passed several studios currently in use and entered The Goldbergs high school set. We also visited the foley stage, and the scoring studio where the orchestra records for Star Wars, the Simpsons, and many other programs. Photos were only permitted outside except for the Jeopardy stage.We also saw historic offices of past movie executives.The tour changes daily or hourly depending on what studios are in use. This is a working studio so tours are different each day. Our day ""Wheel of Fortune"" was being shot so we did not see it.So, if you want ""staged"" studios, amusement rides, expensive food, then by all means go to Universal Studios. But if you want a real insight into the movie and TV business you need to go to Sony. You will spend less and see more about TV and movies.We had only 15 on our tour, all individual groups, not a bus group. Lots of time for Q & A. Two hours long, free parking, and a FREE photo of your group in a Jeopardy scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763rays
40,Good Solid Studio Tour,Very nice Studio Tour. Lots of history on this lot and lots to see and explore. It is a walking tour so beware if it is hot or bad weather. Would have like to see more personality out of the guide like we had at the Warner Bros tour. Definitely did a good job but just a little on the dry side.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/957shannonk
50,Our trip to SONY studios.,We took longer than the 2 hrs for picture taking. There were 46 of us in the tour. Caravan arranged our tour so I couldn't tell you what fee was paid. It was a very informative tour with even a restroom break. Spent extra time in the jeopardy set. Our guide Tyler was very good& informative. We did tip the guide Tyler as he was very good. We actually went to the sound room set. I didn't know that if you want to participate in the jeopardy first you have to take a test & get 35 of the questions. All in all it was well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rama1004
50,Well Worth the Visit,"I was lucky enough to find a Go card for LA and got to go to this attraction and Universal Studios for $130 total. At first, it was hard to find the studio because the entrance is in the back of the building (or at least what I thought was the back). I was confused because they seemed to be filming in the lobby of the plaza?! They were filming for the show the Goldbergs apparently. I couldn't believe how easygoing they were about it. They didn't mind these tourists standing around while they were filming. We were led by this attractive (*drool*) guide named James across the street to the lot. We didn't see any stars which was really disappointing but apparently it is not uncommon at all to see a celebrity walking around. We found the parking spaces of some big name actors and the office of Adam Sandler. Because I'm a massive fan of soundtrack music, my favorite part was getting to go inside the recording studio for big budget film soundtracks. We also got to go on the official set of the Goldbergs as well where they do filming for the scenes inside the home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraearle
30,Interesting to see different sets.,"My sister and I went on the evening tour at 6pm on Thursday, July 21st. All and all the tour was very interesting and we moved rather quickly from one location to another. Near the end of the tour, (although we did not know this was the end) the tour group which consisted of all adults passed by a restroom. Both one man and my sister went in to use the bathroom and both were gone for maybe 15 to 20 seconds. The tour guide who was may be 40 feet away returned and seemed very upset and sarcastic. At no time during the tour did he say we could not use the restrooms. This kind of ruined the experience for us. We felt that his remarks and attitude were rude. We were not children or teenagers. I know he had to keep track of the group, but we were all very cooperative and polite and tried to comply to all his commands. If you need a restroom break, ask him ahead of time.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lily94116
40,Enjoyable 2 hour tour,"The 2 hour tour was better than I anticipated. A nice easy walking tour around the studios of Sony. The tour allowed for you to walk the grounds of the studios, whilst having a few photo ops with some of the famous cars used in Sony films (ghostbusters ECTO-1, Breaking Bad van, Ricky Bobby's car) as well as also walking on the sets of The Goldbergs and Ray Donovan. On this occasion we also were able to see the set of Jeopardy.Our tour guide, David, was full of information and was able to answer the questions we asked. A knowledgable guide can make all the difference.Although this tour may not involve backlots and may not seem as flash as Universal Tours or WB tours are promoted we were extremely happy with our time spent there. We have done every studio tour in LA now and this stacks up well against the bigger players.Although my bucket list item of seeing Adam Sandler was unfortuantely not ticked off, I still had a fabulous time and would certainly recommend and consider doing this tour again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leanneculinapenza
40,Wheel Of Fortune Taping,This was a free fun event that allowed me to see first hand how a television show is put together. We had a slight delay with the taping which allowed Vanna White to do a little W&A with the audience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7fedup
40,Interesting...and it's kinda ticked a box for us,"Went today, great value, good fun, interesting and a bit of celeb spotting (if that's your thing).2hr walking tour...see sets, get some history...wizard of Oz and other classics, see some Oscars, soak up the environment. It's a very cool kinda place Culver City in general and the studios are no different. It's not as glamorous as other tours...but I liked that about it.By the end of the tour I was ready to sit down and have a cold drink...in the mid 90's heat today and there's not a whole load of shade.Good tour guide (thanks Jeanette) good pace through the tour....I wouldn't do it again, but glad I did it whilst here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/828martinn
40,Sony/Columbia Studio Tour,Tour is very simple if compared with Warner or Universal. Only one type (No VIP) tour is done walking inside the working studio.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosBodra
40,Walking tour,"if it's a hot day, wear a hat and take a beverage. Walking pace appropriate for the tour. Guide knowledgeable and courteous. Not enough time at the end of the tour to get a snack, beverage, bathroom, or souvenirs and no opportunity to do so after tour ended due to the restricted area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6953AEjamesc
40,Corporate Tour,"Compared to the others, this one simply felt a lot more corporate to me. It is hard to put words too, but the others just felt a lot more behind the scenes with an informative tour by comparison.This was still a solid value for the money, and we did enjoy it. However, each tour offers something different depending on what is your cup o tea. This campus just was not as robust a tour by comparison to the others. The tour guide was still very informative and we enjoyed the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
30,Sony Tour,"Enjoyed seeing the sets for Jeopardy and The Goldbergs and visiting the building where sound effects are added to TV shows and movies. It was interesting to hear about the large scale productions (including the original Wizard of Oz) that took place in several of the buildings we passed. However, it would have been nice to have been able to get into the aforementioned buildings and also to see more of the current sets. Personally, I thought this was an expensive tour - however, I don't know what other studios charge, so I cannot offer a comparison.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleomissy
50,Sony Pictures Studio Tour,"We needed a studio tour for out of town family guests. Of course, everyone wants a 'behind the scenes' Studio tour when they come. Since we live one block from Sony, friends are certain we have some kind of 'in'.This tour delivered. It's more personal than the Universal Studios tour. It has a wonderful orientation movie overview. We enjoyed the diversity of sets, music recording studios, and first eye account of movies soon-to-be-released. A 'wow' factor sets in when you get to see actual academy awards and sometimes stars showing up for a meeting.It might seem a bit pricey when you have a group and a lot of tickets to purchase; but it's well worth it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyellzey
40,Great tour guide,"Its worth noting that Sony is no universal studios and is a smaller scale, so dont go expecting universal. We had a great tour guide and they made the trip. Highlights included the best picture oscars, Barbara Striesand Sound Stage, Foley theatre, live sets and the breaking bad RV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity24402635444
10,Don't Waste Your Time or Your Money,"This tour was a complete waste of time and money. Our guide told us on three occasions how lucky we were because this or that studio was open today. If they hadn't been open, I wonder what we would have seen!Other than walking you through the grounds and giving you an opportunity to see a set that was mostly covered up because they were on hiatus or the inside of a sound studio, we learned very little and experienced nothing. It would have been nice for an actual sound person to demonstrate a sound effect or two, or to see something filming or to witness a demonstration of something - anything!If you want to spend $40 to look at the outside of buildings and couple on the inside, then go for it. Otherwise, you're better off trying another studio - one that thinks they have to work a little harder to get you there perhaps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyTraveler1
20,Okay tour but been on better,"This tour is okay but is a little bit boring at times. Unfortunately, when we visited, there was a lot of construction going on in a lot of the studios so the tour could not go into a lot of areas! :( We spent most of the time in the tram and didn't see much at all. Go on another tour as this one sucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XStark1ll3rX
40,Nice 3 hr walking tour,It was really cool to see some sound stages and the tour guide was really good. Be sure to book spaces in advance because they have been really full. Definitely worth doing along with the Warner Bros. tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divya92
50,We loved this!,"Sony bought up Tri-Star, Columbia Pictures, and other movie studios, so on this tour you can see both modern and historic television and movie shooting studios and outdoor back lots. We loved seeing the sound stages where The Wizard of Oz was made; the building where child-actors Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland went to school while working; the Foley studio, where post-production sounds effects are added to a film; and the TV sets for the Goldbergs, Jeopardy, and Wheel of Fortune. Our guide was great, and this was an afternoon well spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96ralphd
40,More inside look at Hollywood,"A lot of people say Warner Bother's has a better tour. You do have to walk on this tour and information was not given in between walking stops, but we did get to step onto the actual set of The Goldbergs and not just look at it. You also get to see the wheel of fortune and jeopardy sets, which was nostalgic for me! I would say they are both about even and have pros and cons. Much better souvenir shop at Warner; disappointed with Sony store",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janed556
50,Really enjoyed our tour,"The tour was great. From the valet ( no charge) picking up your car to the end of the tour, it was first class. Our tour guide definitely enjoyed his job. We saw the set of ""The Goldbergs,"" Jeopardy, and Wheel of Fortune to name a few. Lots of hx wad reviewed. A fair amount of walking outdoors. Breaks to sit at the various stops. Ended up at the gift shop and visiting the yogurt stand. Highly recommend it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertthedentist
40,Very interesting!,"This was included as part of our 8 day tour of California, and we found it to be very interesting. The guide was pleasant and informative, and although we didn't see any actual filming (or anyone famous!), we visited various parts of the complex where many well known films have been made, as well as the set of the game show Jeopardy and the Barbara Streisand Music Mixing Studio, the latter of which was fascinating.There was a lot of people buzzing about (so we are sure there was someone famous there somewhere!) and golf buggy type vehicles transporting bits of equipment etc.. The atmosphere was good and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/llpasah
40,good tour,"the tour was good, and the guide was especially friendly & chatty.We didn't get to see any active filming, or anyone famous but learned a lot.It's a walking tour so dress comfortably. The best part for us was the jeopardy set, even though it wasn't current or filming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhf2016
20,Not sure it's worth it,"We visit tours for all of the major studios in town and this tour was definitely the least impressive. First off their website is a joke, especially for the giant in the industry that sony is. Secondly while their tickets and site say the office opens at 9am I called 4 time and was Rudely told that they are not ready to take calls yet and I would have to call back later. So why have this as your opening time then? I finely got through at 1040.The studio lacks intriguing sights, as the studios history had been passed around so much very few movies and sets are on the lot. The tour guide was entertaining although he made it known on several occasions that his job is monotonous. There are no back lots on this tour which is one of the highlights of the other tours. We did get to visit the wheel of fortune and jeopardy sets as well as the sound stage for The Goldberg's. The tour offers a wide list of movies and shows when previewing the tour, however it's almost false advertisement as most of these movies were not even made on the lot, even if Sony had some hand in its making. The tour was mediocre, most likely would not have taken this tour had we known it's content.Also the lobby where you wait is full and busy of Sony employees and there was a great lack of direction and assistance telling you where you need to be. Staff were unwilling and indifferent. All except the gentlemen who parked our car, definitely the nicest man we met the entire experience!A few perks were free valet parking, a free lanyard pass, and a free picture and frame. All of the other tours charged for all of these.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsorrell92
50,Very nice tour with an easy pace,We have been on every studio tour in LA but this was our first to Sony. From the Classics to modern day films and TV shows we saw it all. Our tour guide was fantastic and the pace was perfect. You can see everything you need and it is not the overwhelming crowds you see at some studio tours. I would definitely recommend this tour to those who have been on other studio tours or those that have not.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryK126
50,FIRST RATE,"Well done. Having taken more than one studio tour, this was the best. They took our picture in the beginning and gave it to us as a souvenir .. They were knowledgable and fun. This one I recommend , if you are doing any.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66JudyD
50,So glad we did it,"This 1 ¬Ω hour tour combines the Golden Era of Hollywood with some more recent productions for Film and Television.Our tour guide Ern, was very informative and entertaining about the various aspects of the old MGM film lot as well the more current productions. We were let in on some of the film makes tricks as it comes to location shots and prop design.At the beginning of the tour, we had our photograph taken and were pleasantly surprised that we were given them at the end of the tour for free.TIP The tour departs from the Sony Picture Plaza, corner of Washington & Madison.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13graemet
50,Awesome Staff,"The staff really make this place. We had a horrible situation where I lost my purse etc before arriving and they were so kind to us. Best service we had received during our holiday to LA!! The tour was awesome too, yall should visit! They have the ghost busters vehicles and in the lobby they have so many interesting pieces to look at. We enjoyed the fact it was a walking tour too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855kerryc
40,Simply awesome corporate event!,"Our team held a corporate event last night at Sony Studios, including appetizers, cocktails, dinner, and a tour and I was blown away! The staff, the food, and the tour were really top notch!Pros: location, history, amazing food and drink, the staff (both food and tour guide), and star watching (hey Geena Davis)Cons: noneIf you are thinking about a team event in LA, strongly consider Sony Studios and make sure to include the mini brisket tacos. You'll be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ther0nt
50,BEST TOUR GUIDE IN THE INDUSTRY!,"My family enjoyed the Sony tour on April 8, 2016 that was led by a delightful tour guide - Nicole. We have visited most of the major studios in the area; all of which offered unique ""bells and whistles,"" but none had featured a tour guide as talented as Nicole. We found her to be professional, well-informed, witty, cute and engaging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LARRYBLUEGRASS
30,Out of big studio tours... this is the last in line....,"Having been on the Warner Bros Tour and the (VIP) Paramount Tour... I have to say that this was very ""lacklustre"" with very few highlights.The WB tour had a musuem - and the Paramount Tour went into an actual film vault, plus a smaller museum. This tour had none of that...The guide was fun and knowledgeable (to a point)... but really, for the amount of money they charge ($60 each for 2 hours), it really was pretty uneventful.There's a lot of walking - but not much to see. It's basically just the OUTSIDES of a lot of buildings where things ""USED"" to happen, decades ago. Like the Hepburn building or the Judy Garland building.... yeah, so what???? It's just concrete with a sign on it. We didn't even get to go inside, because they are currently rented out by other writers.My brother had crutches, and not everything was wheelchair accessible - you needed stairs in some situations; which they don't give you advance warning about or disclose on their website. So that alone is reason why we would have avoided it.We visited three sets (one sitcom wrapped for the season - The Golbergs) another drama set (??? forget name; a boxing series) and lastly, the Jeopardy set - but - nothing was functional (all the Jeopardy categories were dismantled) so it was just a black stage. Again, really unimaginative and nothing to write home about.They do make sure they pit stop at two different gift shops though! Someone really needs to revamp this tour - because it just doesn't measure up.The highlight of the tour is seeing the original Ghostbusters car - but that is not worth $60!Sorry to say... but I do not recommend this tour. Save your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanuckGirl2007
40,Absolutely worth visiting!,My wife and I took the first morning tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. We got to go into several places including an ADR studio and Foley studio. We got to visit both Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy's studios and another set where a current show was being set up for filming. The tour group was small and the guide was great. Check it out if you get a chance!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SchneiderVision
30,Good but could be better,"Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable but didn't seem comfortable in front of the group. The tour is mostly walking outside between sound stages as you hear stories about what was filmed inside. Fortunately, we were able to visit 3 sets: Wheel of Fortune, Ray Donovan and The Goldbergs (our favorite). Unfortunately, the sets you get to visit is mostly luck of the draw. It depends what's available on the day you're there. It would be much better if we visited more current show sets rather than walking by the sound stages (they all look the same). There is no back lot to visit like the other studios have. There is no ""museum"" to visit to show off props and costumes from past shows/movies. Only a limited number of items in the lobby of the Plaza. The gift shop was also surprisingly small compared to the other studios. They do have an interesting video highlighting the history of the studio. The tour is advertised as 2 hrs but is really only 1.5 hrs as it includes a stop at the gift shop. We've also attended tours at Warner, Paramount and Universal and would rate this one as #4. Like the other studios, you cannot take pics of anything inside the sound stages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2travel_RS
40,Enjoyable Tour -- best when lot is busy,"We have now taken 3 studio tours and although I think this was probably our third favorite (behind Paramount and Warner Brothers), it was still a lot of fun. This tour was made more enjoyable b/c a TV show as being filmed outside on the lot while we were there -- and that added to the excitement. We did get to go on the Wheel of Fortune soundstage and 2 others (which was more than any other tour we were on). Our tourguide was only ok -- he seemed to just be going through the motions. We were somewhat disappointed that we were supposed to see a Jeopardy taping the day we were there but it was cancelled (not anyone's fault-- just bad luck). All in all a good tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjsbgold
30,Interesting,"I did learn a lot about making TV shows and films as well as recording. Nevertheless, I was on my feet for almost tow hours. Therefore wear comfortable shoes. Out tour guide, Zak, was a want-to-be comedian and tended to take down at our group--and hinted for a tip! Although this was the former MGM Studios, Zak didn't talk about MGM too much; most of his focus was on Columbia Pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dottyk362
30,Good ... not great.,"My wife and I took the Sony Pictures Studio Tour on a beautiful weekday morning in March. Since much of this walking tour is outside, it's best to do the tour on a nice day. Tour tickets for adults are $40 and the tour lasts about 2.5 hours. Convenient underground valet parking is available at no charge. Also included is a personalized photo of your party.The tour starts with an interesting and very informative 15 minute video which explains the history of the studio from its origin as Columbia & MGM. Then the guide takes the group on a walking tour of the extensive and well-manicured studio grounds. A highlight was visiting a few sound stages including Wheel of Fortune and the set of The Goldbergs TV series. However, no active production is seen on the tour. One option is to plan your visit so you can take the tour in the morning and then get tickets for an afternoon taping of one the shows on the lot such as Jeopardy.All in all, this tour was interesting and worthwhile but not as good as some of the other studio tours offered in the LA area. As other reviewers noted, the Warner Brothers tour offers a much better behind-the-scenes experience.Probably the most disappointing aspect of the tour was the male tour guide, a young 20 something who looked like he just rolled out of bed and needed some grooming and clean clothes. He was less than articulate, speaking rapidly in a monotone and seemed rather bored. Hard to believe he was allowed to represent what appeared to be an otherwise first-class corporate operation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJMM
30,"It was fine, but Warner Bros. has the best tour.","The tour was fine. This is the old MGM lot, so there is some history. Of course, most of that history you learn about and do not see. We started with a short movie that gave some background. Of course they could not help but make us watch a preview of what looks like a horrible coming attraction. The tour is then all on foot, although it is an easy walk and there are spots to stop and rest. You see the outside of buildings where the Wizard of Oz or some other movies were made. Kinda neat, but only kinda. The main street area was fun to stroll, but it was set up more as a series of display cases than a working main street. We saw the set of the Goldbergs. That was interesting even though I have never watched the show. Seeing the Breaking Bad RV was neat, plus a few other vehicles. The set of Jeopardy was in use -- so we could not see it (bummer). The foley room was cool, but the recording studio also was in use (another bummer). We saw the set of Wheel of Fortune, but that was just a big room with a scoreboard and wheel under tarps. As boring as the show itself. I'll post a picture. The tour could have been better with a more interesting tour guide. Our guide meant well, and had some good data, but was a snooze. When we did a tour at Warner Brothers a few years ago, the tour guide was energetic, passionate, funny, engaging. That tour was awesome. This tour, by contrast, was a wet blanket, right down to the boring souvenir shop. No one really seemed to mind when the tour ended early. You get a group photo included in the price. That was nice and the tour was fine. But if you only do one tour, I would say that the Warner Brothers tour is the one to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMasterJ
40,Nice tour,This is a very nice way to spend a few hours. Not as grand as Paramount but a lot of good history. We had a chance to go on the set of the Goldberg's which was fun and wheel of fortune which was under construction so not so great. But worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gturco
30,Decent Tour on Old MGM Lot,"We had done the Warner Brothers tour a few years ago which was fantastic, so we had pretty high expectations coming into the Sony tour. The history of the lot was impressive to learn about, and the sets were very cool as well. On the tour, we saw the sets of The Goldbergs and Wheel of Fortune, which probably would have been more interesting if we actually watched the shows, but still very cool. However, our tour guide strongly lacked any character or energy, and at some points became very boring. Also, the tour felt relatively short, as it ran under 2 hours. The Sony tour isn't really great or terrible, but there are certainly others that may be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jadene2016
50,Movie History,This walking tour at Sony in Culver City is a gem of an experience. Being on the site of the former MGM studios it is full of movie history of the golden age of cinema. Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. Tour included visits to modern sets of the Goldbergs and the game show Wheel of Fortune as well. Overall a good studio tour with huge history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZMarty
50,Definitely well worth seeing,"We were in Culver City to see a taping of Jeopardy and decided to add the Sony Studio Pictures Studio Tour to our agenda. The tour is not cheap ($40 per person), but well worth the price for movie lovers. Our tour guide, Donovan, was excellent. He greeted us at 2:30pm for the two hour tour. First we viewed a 15 minute video describing the history of this massive studio lot. What followed was a 90+ minute walk around the lot. We were able to have an inside look at several active studio sites as well as the music room, where events such as Judy Garland's recordings and John William's theme music were made. The tour was made all the more interesting by our knowledgeable and well spoken guide. Hats off to Sony for hiring friendly, well-informed staff. Definitely recommended for the movie buff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irish_Harry
50,Pretty Darn Good,"Went a couple weeks ago with my family and had a great time. The Tour guide Aron made the a blast. We got to see a scoring stage with so much history, and the set of the Goldberg and Jeopardy. It is a good amount of walking so if you don't think you can walk 5 blocks or so then it is probably not the tour for you. But we all had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8694TEjackr
50,This place is AMAZING,"Our Tour Guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and outgoing and he made sure that the whole experience was done on a grand scale! We went into sound studios, saw live tapeings, and had a marvelous behind the scenes kind of adventure that you only dream about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooker813
40,Old MGM lot,"We enjoyed our time at the studios. Sure you don't see lots of active working movie business shenanigans, but a great insight behind the hallowed walls of the old MGM lot.Especially enjoyed seeing the Barbra Striesan sound recording studio, and the sound effects studio.As a small criticism, and based on our own preferences, it would've been great to hear more about the us of the studio during the MGM days of contract players and factory line movie production. We find that more interesting than the recent stuff, but that's a personal preference.Be warned, this is a walking tour and if you're not good on your feet, don't do it.Our tour guide was great. I think his name was Vince? Very friendly and full of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abwriter
50,Great Studio Tour,"A great place for TV and Movie history.We were treated by very friendly staff. After a quick video in a nice screening room, we were split into groups and led into the backlot.Our guide was very knowledgable and answered every question. We visited the Barbra Streisand sound stage, where many motion picture scores were recorded. We got to see all the actual Oscars that the studio has won.We were guided onto The Goldbergs and the Jeopardy set. No pictures are allowed any place indoors, but we were allowed on the Jeopardy set. We got to see the Ghostbusters car and the van from Breaking Bad.Sony is a working studio. So, you never know who you might see. I ran into Jillian Michaels, literally.It was a cool tour, and we will do it again next time we are in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korndogizard
50,Educational and affordable for family,"I looked at other movie studio tours, but for a family of five this was definitely the most affordable at $40 pp. It was the week between Christmas and NY, so nothing was filming, but that allowed us to go into every building. We learned a lot about the whole process. Not ""flashy"" but definitely solid. And the history - to be on the same sound stage where Judy Garland sang ""Over the Rainbow"" ... very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carilovestotravel
40,Worth your time.,"We very much enjoyed this tour even though it was all done on foot and there weren't any flashy effects to wow your senses. The parking was in a garage where they expect you to pay a valet. We simply asked the valet if we could park ourselves and they were fine with that. The tour starts in the lobby of their main offices. We went in the off-season so there were only eight of us in our group making seem like a VIP tour. We watched a short movie and walked across the street to their working lot. Our guide was knowledgeable and easy going, filling us in on past and present movies, stars and sets. Their best known film would be The Wizard of Oz which they have made immortal by placing a huge rainbow over the entry. Walking down the streets you can see live interviews going on, cast members moving from one studio to another, stars arriving for the day, etc. We were allowed into a working Foley studio and the set of Jeopardy among others. The streets were clean but the sets can get a little dirty. The tour ends at the gift shop (of course) but you can buy movies and gift items at a reduced rate. Overall it was a nice walking tour of a working studio where you're not rushed through like cattle, but allowed to interact and ask all the questions you would like. We would take it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280markc
30,"Decent, but there are better studio tours in L.A.","The tour is only $40/person, so why not. We've done WB & Universal tours & we were only minutes from Culver City so it made sense to check out the Sony tour. (The lot also is home to venerable Columbia Pictures which is owned by Sony) I especially wanted to do the tour because the Sony lot was originally the MGM lot! I figured there would be tons of movie history to see but, in a word, I was disappointed. You go in very few buildings. While it was fun & interesting to go into the Thalberg building lobby you only passed by the other iconic MGM buildings; the building where kid stars like Judy Garland & Mickey Rooney went to school, the sound stage where much of Wizard Of Oz was filmed, Adam Sandler's office building, etc. I was especially disappointed we couldn't see any of the huge sound stages where so many classic MGM movies were shot. Not even a peek??? Come on! We did see the set of the current TV show The Goldbergs, that was interesting. Unfortunately both Wheel Of Fortune & Jeopardy sets were dark & covered in drop clothes. We did see the Breaking Bad RV & a Ghost Busters car. Good photo opportunities.If you're interested in Hollywood/film history it's fun to gaze at these buildings & just imagine Louis B Mayer, Irving Thalberg & all the stars walking into them & around the lot. Be aware the lot is MUCH smaller now than it was in its MGM prime.All in all a decent but somewhat disappointing, tour for $40.The WB & Universal tours are better. You're not going to see that much but you will be walking in the footsteps of some of the most famous stars in Hollywood history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djmes
40,"If you've never been, there is a lot of history here and some fun too.","I grew up in Southern California because of my fathers employment in the film and television industry. I've visited back lots, studios, stages, and so on. I've even been on this lot when it was MGM so I recalled some look and feel from the 1960's. Parking and orientation is easy. The overall orientation is good led by a video in comfy seats. The connection of Sony Pictures Studio to something you saw on TV or in the theatre is almost guaranteed. That's fun whether it might be Jeopardy, or Day at the Races or Ghostbusters. There's a robust walk through the back lots, sound stages, and offices of the campus. We went into an ADR studio where our guide covered the purpose and need for such a studio. We saw no stars on our tour; that's always a function of chance. We did get onto a set for The Goldbergs, which I have never seen but which afforded a great comparison for those that did of a set and the final product on the screen. Fun seeing the intense detail of elements in a simple living room. We did get to see Oscars awarded over time to a group of films; a real thrill to see the statue and recall the film from the backing poster. I think this was a 2-hour visit and well worth the time and cost. The end was a visit to the souvenir store if you're disposed to that kind of purchase. Probably a great good weather event. Our day was cool (unusual for SoCal) so pleasant in the walking. I would not want to do this in the rain. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCooks
30,Expected much more..,"When I was at Hollywood this summer, I visited all the studio tours. Sony Pictures Studio Tour was only one which was disappointing. Did not see much, maybe because they make you walk to everywhere. Or they just don't have much to see.. But for a movie freek like me, this still was a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OGRhi
10,Computer says no...,Deadlines are everything.Three trains and a bus from Pasadena then a fast walk the last half mile to arrive at the famous (MGM) Sony Studios before 10.30am. Guests wearing official looking tags were already standing around chatting as I entered the vast atrium and there was an air of excitement.Imagine my disappointment then when I was informed by two blank-faced booking clerks that ‚Äòthere are no studio tours today‚Äô. I asked if it was normal to cancel tours and was told it was not and it didn‚Äôt happen often. I was told that I could come tomorrow instead and that booking ahead was advisable but not essential.From what I could gather from the guests already in place they were a group of lawyers from out of state who had block-booked the day and Sony just pulled down the shutters on everyone else. There was no information about this policy anywhere on their website.No matter how hard I pleaded to be allowed to join the tour it really was a case of ‚Äòthe computer says no‚Äô.Very disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnBeasley
40,ACCOMMODATING +++,"We visited Sony Picture Studios for a prebooked tour. Unfortunately for us we did not realize how congested LA traffic can be in the morning & we were late for/missed our tour. The tour department said they could get us into a later tour however due to our flight home time it wasn't going to be possible for us to go later. We were disappointed but were ready to go find another adventure for the morning when one of the staff, Aaron volunteered to take us on an ""unofficial"" tour and his supervisor agreed to that plan. It was fun walking around and seeing behind the scenes at Sony and also seeing the sets of Jeopardy & Wheel of Fortune on our ""private tour"". It was really interesting and fun and we appreciated how accommodating the tour staff at Sony were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/120camb
40,Cool,It was nice to see how movies are made and sounds are mixed into a movie . The tour guide was cool. Very informative on how movies where made and where there made. It was also cool that the tv show the Goldbergs where filming an episode of there show in the lobby. Very cool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jahmai
40,"Not as good as last year, but still worth it.","Honestly it is a gamble on how tours go based on who your guide is. I had an incredible guide last year and we got to see so many great things. This year we had some snafu's. There was a very weird older gentleman on our tour that held everything up because he was lagging behind and asking everyone in the group strange questions, our guide was not very experienced and was pointing out some less than interesting things and because we were behind we were not able to see half the things I got to see last year (like the studio where the Big Bang Theory films for example) We did not go into any sound stages, just walked around outside the entire trip with the exception of the prop room and the foley booth. Oh, and we sat inside the Wheel of Fortune set for a few minutes at the end. The hero cars at the beginning of the tour were very cool but otherwise this tour lacked the character it had last year (which again depends on who you get for a guide and how much effort they put into it). I would do this again and hopefully have a more upbeat host. Parking is free with a valet to boot, you get a free souvenir photo of you in front of a green screen that ends up being the Wheel of Fortune Wheel behind you. There is a lot of walking so I do suggest wearing comfortable clothing and shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
40,"Interesting tour, but not my cup!","As part of our California Coast tour we ended up at Sony. It was fun to see the sets and learn how Sony developed. It was also nice to hear about the ways the studio reuses its lot to create sets for new shows. Movie buffs might like it, but I prefer a good movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimgo
40,Great Walking tour,"Every studio in Hollywood has something different to offer. There is not the action of Universal Studios at Sony, but the what you see on the walking tour is great. It is a WALKING tour, so if you are not able to walk for two hours, this isn't the tour for you. The guide was new, but informative, but his inexperience did show a bit. As a ""Wizard of Oz"" fan, to see the stages were the movie was filmed was a highlight. You get to go on the set of some game shows which was really neat. After the tour, if you want a delicious lunch, grab a sandwich at Wolfgang Puck in the Sony Entertainment complex. It was so entertaining to watch the cook building the orders and the meal was great! Don't pass up the tour, be ready to walk, and soak in all the history the studio has to offer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9Buffalolady20
40,Amazing day!,"Wonderful experience.Valet parking was complementary. Getting our tickets was a breeze.We were lucky enough to see Mark Wahlberg, Adam Sandler, Jeff Garlin and the great composer John Williams.The Jeopardy and Wheel of fortune sets were interesting.I don't recomend this tour for families with small children, there's a lot of walking and most of the tour is spent learning about the history of buildings.It was well worth the $40.00 admission price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pret38
40,Get in shape,Be prepared the walk and walk and walk. Suggestion tour early so your fresh to walk... not after a day of sightseeing like I did. In my opinion the WB tour is slightly better.... not because you have to walk. WB had interactive exhibits and the just seemed to give more information on how things are done behind the scenes.Sony is cheaper and they give you a pass to wear around your neck that you keep and a photo also. Nice touch !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEFFREYG430
40,Wheel of Fortune Taping,"I am not a Wheel of Fortune fan, but this was a fun and low key activity to take my parents (who are in their late sixties) to see when they came to visit from NY.I have been to Jimmy Kimmel & The Voice tapings, this was much more organized and involved less waiting around. We sat through 3 WOF tapings, 2 of them were kind of boring, but the last one was exciting because the contestant was on a roll and won a lot of $$.Vanna was very sweet, she came over and talked to the audience between 1 of the tapings and answered a few questions.Best of all, these tickets are free and somewhat easy to get. Also, parking is free and it was relatively easy to find a spot in the garage.I definitely recommend this to WOF Super fans.*Tip*: If you can't get WOF tickets, try getting Jeopardy ones. The two studios are next door to each other and share the same film crew, I believe they each film for 2 weeks and take a break while the other films.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
40,"Interesting, but would have liked to see some action","It was interesting to see where the Wizard of Oz was filmed and realize that movie makers are really magicians at what they do. Got to see the Jeopardy set. Would have liked to seen some filming of a movie or show. Quiet day on the tour, I guess. Guide was informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gwendis

50,"An informative,fun and entertaining afternoon!","Loved the tour! Got to see the scoring stage, the Foley stage, the Jeopardy set and many other interesting site.

A great tour for old movie buffs and for people into shows like Breaking Bad, The Goldbergs and other Sony shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552charliel
10,Sony Pictures - Customer Service AWFUL!!,"I'm making my review short and sweet. I'm glad we didn't go to this studio. I had pre-reserved two spots at the studio as a surprise for my hubby and as it turned out due to travel and traffic, we were unable to make our 9:30am reservation to the studio. I contacted them by email requesting another time a couple days later. Not only did it take a couple days for them to get back to me, the answer I received was surly!! I had been given a two hour window to get back to them, which I did, but they ignored that fact. They said that they had held the space ( which I doubt as I've been on tours before and they do fill up if the people booked in do not show up ) as they hadn't heard from us which was a lie.Had this been a huge tour with a trolly and expenses out on their behalf, I can understand their being upset but as it was a walking tour, the likes of which based on other reviews didn't seem that great, I was more than happy for my husband and I to spend our in excess of $100 for our two tickets on a different tour/attraction.It's unfortunate as being out of country visitors we would have greatly enjoyed seeing the studio - too bad the person handling emails decided being snotty was a better route to take.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaleenmrss
40,Studio Tour,"We chose this because it was not to long or to expensive.They showed us a 15 minute movie showing the history of Sony. The tour is a walking tour. I don't even remember the name of our guide, he was so listless. The tour is a walking tour. The studio we were supposed to see was being used so we just walked by the outside. We did visit the studios where Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune are taped. With everything covered up there was little to see. The most interesting part of the tour was probably the Folet Studio where they add sound effects for movies.I wished we had tried one of the other studio tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertcopeland
50,Welcome to the 'Culver City' Studio Tour!,"Doesn't have quite the same ring, does it? That's why they call it the SONY Pictures Sudios Tour. Would have been even better if they had called it the MGM Studios Tour. That is the old 'movie glory days name' of this 16 sound stage monster used to be known as. We all enjoyed this tour, but there was a problem. First the good side. $40 per adult. Free parking, two TV show sets (Jeopardy! And Wheel of Fortune), Spider-Man and Wizard of Oz props. Also a stop at a sound mixing lab and 'area' (don't know what to call it, but it's where the musicians view the film, make the music, and edit it into the final copy. OK, now the downside. This is a walking tour, 2 hours. No children under 12 (which eliminates a lot of revenue, Sony). Only open Monday through Friday. Only four tour times per day: 9:30, 10:30, 1:30 and 2:30. And now for the biggest problem. This place is not easy to get to! Use google maps carefully! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden

40,Definitely worthwhile,"This is a very well put-together tour. I went on it because it is the old MGM lot so I enjoyed the historic aspects of the tour (the Thalberg building, the old school-room and all the buildings named in honour of legends who worked there). It was great to be there in a day when we could go into some of the workspaces and see behind the scenes (the Barbra Streisand recording studio was a highlight). This isn't a razzle-dazzle tour like the one at Universal Studios but if you are interested in history or filmmaking it is very worth while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethbH4619CL
30,"Good tour, but others do it better","I have done with WB tour and some others in LA. This tour was good but just that.. good. Got to see some sets and the backlot. The tour guide was very good but there is not much to see over WB. I would tell others to do it, but do some of the others first. Got to see Jeopardy and Wheel sets that was kinda cool. I did like that you walked around this lot, most of the others put you in a cart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcl80

40,"Good tour, but don't expect to see any sets","This was a fun tour, but we didn't get to see any sets. They did take us in Jeopardy, but it was set up for Sports Jeopardy, so not the same. We saw where the orchestra recorded music and another studio where they redid sound, but that was about it. Tour guide was very good. We did get to keep our pass and lanyard and they gave us a free pic that they take, and you get the employee discount in the gift shop. That's a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sleeper72
50,Enjoyable Tour,"We were concerned about the tour based on the negative reviews, however, we were pleasantly surprised that the tour was enjoyable and informative.Our family has done the Universal Studios and Warner Brothers ‚Äì this tour has good value in its own merit and is not just a tour of building exteriors.This is a two hour walking tour. It begins in the main building (tall building with slanted smoked glass). There is underground valet parking; technically there is no cost for parking but tipping the valet is customary. Tour guests must arrive 30 minutes in advance to check in; this means that each person in the party (I don‚Äôt know about children) must show ID. Backpacks must be checked also.Prior to departure, tour guests that are interested may take a picture in front of a green screen. At the end of the tour, you receive a free photo of yourself on the Jeopardy set.The group initially started as approximately 50 but was split in half after we saw a brief film. We were placed with Erin (female) as our guide and Vincent took the other group. Erin did a great job. We were able to hear her, and she gave a lot of interesting history and facts about the lot and the studio‚Äôs history in general.Though we did initially speak outside briefly before going into a building, we did get to sit inside an ADR room. We also went into the Barbra Streisand Recording Studio, which is rich with movie history. What areas you can access or what you will see/experience will depend on the day‚Äôs schedule. We were told that certain celebrities have offices onset but if we see them, we cannot ask for an autograph or photo ‚Äì but we could wave. When walking past areas, we saw assigned parking for Kim Novak and Bryan Cranston. We also saw Adam Sandler‚Äôs black Escalade Golf Cart.For the last 20 minutes of the tour, we stopped in front of the studio tour store. We were able to use the restroom, visit the studio tour, Yogurtland and the Sony Tech Store. I don‚Äôt know if anyone went over to the Coffee Bean and Tea Life which was a short distance away. After everyone was accounted for, we then returned to the tour origin area.I enjoyed the tour and would return. Be sure to reserve your tickets will in advance to select the dates and times of your choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasBling
40,Sony Studio Tour,"We had nothing to do last week so we decided to take the Sony tour.We arrived in the expansive lobby full of memorabilia, and after a quick photo and greeting from Aaron,we were escorted into the theater.We were split into 2 groups after the informative movie on the history of the studio lot.Our group was fortunate to have Aaron as our tour guide.He was a wealth of information, and made sure all of our questions were answered.We saw a few member of "" The Goldvergs"" cast, who were friendly and funny as they greeted our group!This is an easy walking tour, with a few sets of stairs (Jeopardy set), we were not rushed, and were able to take lots of photos.There is not a lot left from the old days, but the original lights hang still hang over the old entrance, and the tour passes by the sound stages, home of many classics.We were able to make a quick stop in the well stocked gift shop.I recommend this tour for anyone who is short on time,or on a budget, the tour moves quickly, but we got a lot of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzieQ858
40,Better Than Expected Tour,"My 12 year old daughter and husband wanted to do the 2 most popular studio tours while visiting LA, while I only wanted to do Warner Bros since the reviews for that tour seemed more favorable. I am glad they pushed me toward Sony because I found it more educational and authentic, as well as worth the price you pay for it. Although we saved some $$ since we had the LA GoCards (which I highly recommend, by the way), for $40 entry per person (and I believe $25 for 12yr old), you get parking, the tour and a souvenir photo; and those who take the tour are eligible for employee discounted prices on souvenir merchandise. It is a 2-hour walking tour, but there are ample opportunities to sit in between. Our guide (sorry, but I cannot remember his name) was very knowledgeable and had a lot of information to share...I also really enjoyed the 15 minute intro film in the beginning. I could see why WB gets a little more attention since it is more commercial and maybe appears more exciting, but I would put it on an even playing field with the Sony tour. The 3 of us totally enjoyed it, although my daughter and husband said they preferred WB I rate them a tie. I'd also like to add that we arrived early and grabbed a bite to eat in the Sony cafeteria (open to employees and public)...food was inexpensive and tasty! If you have a chance to do both tours, take advantage...if only one it's up to you to decide which sounds more like its your style and worth your time and $$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranJ811
40,Almost magic,"$40/ per person and no access to a single sound stage!!!! At least our guide, Erin, was a delight. Did see an ADR studio were actors rerecord dialogue - on the names that have been in that room at that mike. Also saw the big recording studio where the big boys, Williams, Zimmer, Steiner, Horner, etc have conducted, too cool for the film music fan. Jeopardy set was a poor substitute for a working sound stage. Added plus on the tour - Walter White's nasty camper and Pontiac Aztec.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BatGuano30
50,Great Tour,"After hearing what others had to say, we weren't expecting much from this tour but did it anyway as it was included in our GO LA cards. We are so glad we did.

Bonus!Secondly, free photo of the group to commemorate the visit !Thirdly, I tour guide that knows their stuff, and was very enthusiastic.

50,So glad I chose this tour,"This tour was our third after doing Universal and Warner. I found this very informative and more detailed with a very enthusiastic guide. We saw inside the Barbra Streisand Sound Studio which I found fascinating with so much history. There were photo opportunities by the cars from Ghostbusters and Breaking Bad, and inside the Jeopardy set. The other set we saw was from ‚ÄòMasters of Sex‚Äô which was interesting but not a show that I watch. Our guide was so great, when I told him we were fans of The Goldberg‚Äôs he tried his best to get us a glimpse of the set but it was being worked on for season 3 so only saw the outside of the Kitchen, a hallway and garden but I was grateful that he tried. Total tour time was 2 and a half hours, and recommended to anyone wanting to see a historic studio lot for a reasonable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52hayleyg

My husband and I found it very interesting, our tour guide was very informative, we got to see the jeopardy stage, and a few comedy show sets, there were filming a new show and we got to see a few stars walking by, no one was bothering them which was nice. It was a fun tour and I would recommend it if you have a free afternoon in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitaa69
50,No Theme Park. Just a Cinema Enthusiast's Paradise.,"Too much to rave about. First off though, we were dazzled by our guide, forget his name, but no robot, someone who clearly loves his job. I got the feeling they don't burn out their guides too much, packing in millions of tours a week. The guy was fresh and loved people asking questions. OMG the Barbra Streisand Sound Studio where John Williams did all his scores and you can see exactly where Judy Garland recorded Somewhere Over the Rainbow. I leaned up against Walter White's Winnebago - woo eee. And the Ghostbusters vehicle too! We stressed out a lot choosing which studio tour to take and I am convinced we got it right. This was formerly Columbia Pictures. the place wreaks of history, but lots for the younger generations too. Just go. It's very very good bang for your buck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55IanM
30,Interesting Walking Tour,"Sony Studios also owns Columbia Pictures, so there were many interesting things to see and hear about. Wheel of Fortune is filmed there and we got to see some of the memorabilia. The guide was knowledgeable on the history of the studio and told us some fun facts. It was enjoyable, but not as good as some other studio tours that I've been on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylan98
50,Highlight of our LA trip,"Our tour guide, Aaron, was entertaining and informative.

20,Bem pobre / very poor,"O passeio √© √† p√©, ent√£o pode ficar meio quente. Especialmente porque n√£o podemos entrar em quase nenhum set, apenas em 3 ou 4 (nenhuma foto √© permitida). Passamos 2 horas passeando pelo lado de fora de v√°rios sets com uma guia que, infelizmente, n√£o era t√£o animada (era gentil, mas extremamente sem vontade de estar ali -Erin-). Honestamente, melhor pagar um pouco mais e ir no da Warner, onde voc√™ pode tirar fotos, ver mais cen√°rios e o guia (Bob) √© bem mais extrovertido. No final, ganhamos um desconto nas lojinhas (pre√ßo de funcion√°rio), uma foto e os nossos crach√°s. Tecnicamente, gastamos 40 d√≥lares por 25% de desconto em uma loja com pouca variedade, uma foto em tela verde e crach√° de papel. // The tour is on foot, so it might get a little hot.

We spent 2 hours walking around the outside of the buildings with a guide that, sadly, was not exited at all (she was kind, but didn't wanted to be there -Erin-). Honestly, it's better to pay a little more and go to Warner, where you can take photos, see more scenarios of famous movies/series and the guide (Bob) is far more fun. In the end, we got discount on the store (price of employee), a little picture, and our batches.

Brief movie introduces guests to the history of the studio lot (originally MGM). You cross the street and enter through the gates to begin the walking tour which on my visit included the entry way to the executive offices, a brief stop by the old MGM gate, passed by the Streisand Sound Stage, entered a Foley room, saw vehicles from various films, explored the sets of Donovan as well as The Goldbergs, and concluded at the set of Jeopardy.

30,OK for an aficionado ...,If you're staying at this end of town and have limited time and really want to do a studio tour then Sony is OK.

We had two young boys with us 5 & 7 and they had to wait in the lobby for us to return as they don't allow anyone under 12 on the tour. We did get to see a lot of sound stages and sat in the studio seats for jeopardy. The tour was about 2 hours and worth the price,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geogh3

20,Disappointing,"Travelled for over an hour and a half via public transport to visit the studios - and it really was a waste of our time on the final day.We had Go LA cards, but unlike Warner Bros, I couldn't book via email prior to arrival, so had to call when I arrived in LA (expenses from a UK mobile).Check in was quick and easy, and had our photo taken in front of a green screen for collection later (this is free).Firstly, you watch a 15 minute video about the history of Sony, followed by a sneak peak of the trailer for an upcoming movie.We were then split into two groups and headed across the road to the lot to begin the tour. Unlike other studios, there are points where photos are strictly not allowed (don't push this - security is very tight and we saw a lady forced to delete her photos and it was all very dramatic - I'm guessing because of the Sony hack??).We saw a rainbow in the entrance (not as impressive as I would think), as well as the outsides of lots of sets where famous movies have been filmed. We also visited the set of two U.S. TV shows I've never heard of ...Overall, I wouldn't recommend visiting Sony. It was boring, the guide was boring and the highlight was seeing the Breaking Bad RV ... All that travel for one thing? Such a shame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linzi03
10,Waste of time,"This was soooo boring and you walked everywhere. The highlight of our tour was ""The Goldburgs"" set. No one in our tour had ever seen it, so we were not impressed. Tour guy said ""shi*"" a lot. Not professional at all. Save your money and just look at the lobby displays, that's where you see the best stuff. Basically it's a walking tour, showing you the doors to a sound stage.Warner Brothers was great! They take you to Friends set and you get pics on the coffee shop couch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seashells79
10,Disappointed,"All the studios had mixed reviews but this was closest on our path so we decided to try it. I believe the tour guide can make or break the tour and we had the misfortune of getting Sam. He could have gotten us excited about the industry or the process or even the upcoming productions, but none of that happened. Everything that was displayed or discussed was really really old, such as Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge over River Kwai, or From Here to Eternity. Men In Black and Spiderman films were the most recent mentioned, but I‚Äôm sure there must be something newer going on. The film that was shown at the beginning of the tour was the best part, as it showed clips from some classic films. I expected to walk away having learned something about the industry such as makeup, costume design, the relationship between the studios, between TV and films, between actors and the studios ‚Äì but none of that was explained. Why was the RV from Breaking Bad on the lot when it wasn‚Äôt even a Sony production? The tour posed more questions than answers and was a huge disappointment. Try a different studio tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patronking
50,Wonderful Experience,"Have to say that this tour was leaps and bounds ahead of another studio tour that we did. Our guide Vince was very knowledgeable, had a great personality, and made sure everyone got to see as much as possible. The tour also gives everyone a FREE photograph of themselves against the green screen (another studio charges $16+) and a discount at the studio store. We got to go on the set of the hit shows ""The Goldbergs"", ""Jeopardy!"" and a couple of other shows as well. Be aware though that this tour is a walking one, there is no tram but it wasn't too bad walking it. If you only have time for one studio tour don't fall for a name you think is ""bigger"" because the Sony tour is definitely BETTER!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fenway302
40,Good tour!,"We went on this tour and it was a lot of fun. I have to say, it's strictly walking, so keep that in mind. We were able to see the set of Friends, Wheel Of Fortune, Jeopardy, The Goldbergs, & Gilmore Girls - it was very cool! We enjoyed this tour a lot and at the end they give you a souvenir, a picture that take from the beginning of the tour. Lots of fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB31485
50,Very good informative tour,"The tour was very informative, we all (with 2 kids 10 and 14) enjoyed it very much. The 2 hours went very fast. Visited TV show sets, Jeopardy set, many studios. Pre-tour at the SONY headquarters with many movies' artifacts was very interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SvetaK719
40,"For $40...Free parking, good excercise and Interesting Facts and History of a Mega Studio production house.","So there were 4 Major Studios to choose from with only being able to see 1 this trip, so we booked the cheapest and rated least popular in the greater Los Angeles area. Mind you this was an MGM Studio lot and is now housed with Tri-star, Columbia, Happy Madison productions among more. We get there an hour before the tour starts and park for Free in the Valet below the building and go get out tickets in the main lobby. Food available in the cafeteria and food by Wolfgang Puck Catering as well. The lobby has been used for filming many scenes whether it be TV or Movies. It was nice to walk around and check out props for many different movies from Men in Black to Spiderman. Our tour started right at 1:30 and you pose for a Free, yes free photo on the green screen, ours happening to be Wheel of Fortune in the background. We then went across the street to the main lots and enjoyed tidbits of info from our guide, sorry can't remember here name, but she was good. So in short, we saw the set of The Goldbergs, new sitcom I believe, Ray Donovan, Wheel of Fortune, The Ghostbusters Car, and the Breaking Bad RV. It was worth the money, only 2 negatives were not seeing any celebrities, and too much time spent on The Goldbergs' set, over a quarter of the tour, a bit much. Overall, good to very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christK5337IE
30,Eh~,"In theory the Sony tour was a great idea. The guide Sam was friendly and knowledgeable, but there were so many restrictions that it made the tour less than ideal. You were not allowed to take pictures of the things that you were there to take pictures of and while interesting and informative you didn't really see much of anything at all. So not worth the $40 price tag. On the plus side, parking is free...We saw on set for a tv series and the set of wheel of fortune. Aside from that, not much else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emarcieg

40,Jeopardy Taping -- fun for Jeopardy fans!,"This review is for a taping of the quiz show 'Jeopardy' at Sony Picture Studios.We took a bus tour from our home town to LA specifically to see a taping of the TV quiz show 'Jeopardy' at Sony Studios. Fortunately for us, the bus tour company arranged everything like getting the tickets, etc. I probably wouldn't have gone under my own steam as it's not that easy to obtain tickets.We arrived about 1:30pm and a Jeopardy page came to greet our bus and escorted anyone that needed the bathroom to one of those outside mobile units that contains several stalls. We waited about 1/2 an hour before everyone in our group was done and then we were escorted straight to the Jeopardy studio. We were lead inside and told where to sit (no waiting around, no security checks -- we were surprised!) You're not allowed to take photos outside on the lot.The studio is relatively small and there are several staff members flapping around, judges, stage hands, camera operators, pages, etc. The audience is given a brief talking to by Johnny Gilbert about being quiet and not saying the answers out loud, etc. He's very welcoming. You're not allowed to take photos inside the studio.The contestants are lead onto the stage and taping begins. (Apparently they go through a rehearsal earlier in the day). About 5 games are taped a day and we saw 2 being taped. Tapings happen about 46 days a year.During commercials, Alex Trebek fields questions from the audience. I thought he was very nice, open and warm.They did a drawing for the audience members for 2 prizes. Then, after the two tapings were over, we exited the studio into a hallway where there is Jeopardy memorabilia like an old podium, Emmy awards, photos, a cardboard cutout of Alex Trebek, contestant podiums, etc. You are allowed to take photos in this area, but it's congested with all the audience members and the contestants' friends and families. I was amazed that the contestants went out the same back door as the audience members!We were there about an hour and a half for 2 tapings. They did 3 tapings in the morning with a different audience.The shows that we saw will air on TV approximately 3 months later.I would have rated this 5 stars if they'd had a gift shop at the Jeopardy studio where you could buy hats/T-shirts/keyrings, etc.Please click yes if you found anything in this review helpful. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfr
20,'And over there is a large empty warehouse were 50 years ago a film was made',"Disappointing studio tour. The Warner tour is much better. There are a few things that are worth seeing, the RV from Breaking Bad, the ghostbusters car but too often a lot is pointed out and you were told what happened inside it in the past but what you are looking at could just as easily be a home depot store minus the signage. The only actual set we visited was 'jeopardy' a crappy US quiz show. At Warner it is both a working studio but some of the classic sets have been retained to make it a worthwhile experience for tourist, here nothing is retained at Sony just the space. If you are lucky Adam Sadler may have been there last week. And it is not cheap $40 a head.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/researcher59
50,An Excellent Tour for Everyone,"I went on this tour during my second visit to LA and I had mixed feelings if this was going to be worth the money to do. I had already toured Warner Brothers and I figured that it was going to be very similar - I was dead wrong. This was such a great tour and totally different than Warner Brothers. There is a lot of walking on this tour so be prepared for that, but it gives a much more intimate feeling to the tour. The place looks a little run down to be honest, but It is a very cool place to see. You get to walk in to sets of current shows (we went on to the goldbergs set and wheel of fortune) and you really get a good feel for what it takes to make a tv show or a movie. Highly recommend this tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456zachr
10,We saw Taylor Swift and that's about it,"My family and I got the worst tour guide ever, he had no idea what he was doing and he took us into all these weird buildings that had nothing to do with the tour. At one point he took us into this building where he forced us to climb 10 flights or so of stairs just to see someone painting a backdrop and we weren't allowed to know what it was for. Whenever someone asked a question he said ""I'm not sure, I'm not an expert! Haha!"" He was a strange character. Most of our tour was us walking outside of buildings that all looked identical and he name dropped movies that were made 50 years ago. He also kept mentioning a show called The Goldbergs and said ""I haven't seen it myself but I hear it has some good good references. I don't have cable so I don't know about our shows really"" Like seriously, I thought I was being punk'd. He went on and on about The Goldbergs I can't even count how many times. We went on the set and he mentioned about 10 movies that weren't even made by Sony and he said ""they all have sets similar to ours."" The only good part of our tour was when we saw Taylor Swift in a car with her dad for about 5 seconds and then she put her window up and we never saw her again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dani9797
30,Good tour but could be better.,"This is a 2Hours walking tour so prepare for the weather and achy legs. Our tour was after lunch and although the weather was perfect- sunny with cool air, it was so tiring.We were expecting to see celebrities but it was disappointing when the tour was basically pointing out to this building, that building, this studio, & that studio. Few exciting parts of the tour were the backdrop building (however you have to take ~65 steps/5 floors to get up), scoring studio (where Barbara Streisand recorded), & Jeopardy studio.First copy of group picture was free - thank goodness.If you'd like do a studio tour, i'd recommend Warner Brothers than this. But if you like to see Sony Pictures, i'd recommend schedule to attend a taping (Jeopardy, Wheels of Fortune, Queen Latifah, etc) instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliviaQ
40,Educational and Fun for Us.,"We really enjoyed this tour. It was a nice leisurely tour. We selected it because it was a nice mix of old Hollywood history, since MGM used to be located on the lot and because the lot produces a number of television shows. We got to see and actually walk around the set of ""The Goldbergs."" It was incredibly interesting to see all of the details and thought included on the set, such as period board games, photos, furniture, etc. Also, Sony has an exhibit of the ""Jeopardy!"" studio, including its history. I found it interesting to learn a little about the sound and production studios and see the actual size of the production stages. I'm not a movie or tv production buff and had no desire to celebrity spot, so it may not be detailed enough for those that are, but it was enough to give us a taste without spending a lot of time and money.I can't compare Sony with the other studio tours, since this was the only studio tour we participated. However, I found the group size quite manageable, maybe less than 15 people. As a final note, a person requiring a wheelchair was in our tour group. The studio lot is completely equipped to deal with wheelchair access, and the tour guide was able to facilitate the use of ramps and specific wheelchair elevators seamlessly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlington7175
20,Just walking around buildings.,"We did both the Warner Brothers and Sony tours. I felt like we saw and learned lots more in the WB one. Sony, for $40, seemed to be pretty much pointing to buildings and telling us what happened in them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62anne2014
40,Good tour,"There are only 4 tours of major studios and this is one of the best. Parking is easy and free (unusual in LA) across the street from the studio. It is a walking tour of about 2 hours but the pace is slow and easy to navigate. You do not go into sound stages but you do get to see the ""Jeopardy"" stage. Be sure to check out the plaques on the sound stages listing the movies and TVs made within. Also be sure to get the GOLA pass which includes this studio along with many other LA attractions. While you are here walk down the street to the Culver Studios. Not open for tours but the front of the building was used for the opening shot in Gone With The Wind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
50,Totally different to Warner Bros,We had a GoLA card and just did this because we were heading over that way. Glad we did. It's totally different to Warner Bros. We saw some stars which was a bonus. The 2 hour tour went so fast and small group. Didn't know anything before about this tour or hear of it but it's very interesting and I liked the small group. If you liked Warner Bros then you will enjoy this,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771323
40,No rides like some studio tours but genuine movie lot worth a visit,Guided walking tour takes in the studios where all the MGM classics were filmed as well as the sound studios where albums and movie scores have been recorded. Highlight for me was the Foley studio where the sound effects are still recorded. The 1920s architecture and sidewalks used in many films area lovely nod to old. Hollywood. Adam Sandler has his production company on-site too and is often around. Make time to stop for a nice cream.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlogan1302
30,Hit or Miss depending on what Stages are open,"Ours was a miss, no stages were open so we didn't see much. Tour guide did his best in showing us around, so we were somewhat entertained, but a bit of a let down when you can't see any studios on a studio tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chillsnthrills
50,An Amazing Couple of Hours at the Old MGM Studios,"This Tour although mainly focused on Sony Pictures is on the lot of what was once MGM, probably one of the most famous Studios in the world. I went on a 2.5 hour walking tour, where I was Lucky enough to go into the Thalberg building, visit the Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage, where Judy Garland record Somewhere over the Rainbow, and many other famous film scores were done. we poked our heads into a couple of Sound stages, Stage 15 which is the second largest Stage in the world.( 007 stage at pinewood being the biggest) had the Ray Donovan sets standing on it. We went into a hole room from the tv Show Masters of Sex. visited the Queen Latifa Set and Jepody, Both in Hiatus when i was there. I found just walking around this Lot to be quite amazing, we saw the building where Mickey Rooney Judy Garland & Liz taylor went to School, saw the Commisiary where the likes of Clarke gable would eat Lunch, and where Judy was only allowed Chicken Soup , or Mr Mayer's orders while making the Wizard of Oz. I throughly enjoyed this tour, Just being where they made and still do make some of the most incredible Movies and TV shows ever was thrilling. I throughly recommend this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richardkingcott
40,Second best studio tour in L.A.,"It spent some good time showing us the sound stage, and the effects area. Nice touch was the free photo with a wheel of fortune background.Lot of history and enough differences to do it swell as the Warner bros VIP studio tour.Did it as part of the go card los Angeles 3 day pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LozzaCam
10,We had tickets... they closed down.,"Poor Sony, I guess we shouldn't have expected much after the hack but we were disappointed that we had tickets and they just apologized and said they were closed to tours until further notice. We were disappointed... hope to tour next time we are in LA. Raincheck?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyH447
50,Best Studio Tour In LA,"If you have the choice to do this or Warner Bros, choose this.We had done Warner Bros the day before and were apprehensive after a lacklustre tour there but the difference is like night and day! Our guide Tony was awesome, he knew his stuff and kept the whole tour really fun and interesting.We were given a great insight into the behind the scenes work that goes into making TV/Movies with the foley stage all the set construction. Although on foot it wasn't at all arduous, the place is pretty big but you only realise that afterwards as there is plenty to see.We went on the Goldbergs set which was really cool to see up close and met the star, Jeff, who was really nice. We also got to visit the sets of the Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and where the sitcoms are filmed.Being big fans of Breaking Bad, getting up close to the RV and Aztec from the show was a blast, as well as the other cars: Ghostbusters, Talladega Nights, 22 Jump St helmet buggy.The parking was valet right under the main building where you start the tour, so easy. They take a green screen picture of you at the start that gets superimposed over the Jeopardy set and given as a free souvenir at the end of the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydmik
50,WHERE ARE MY SPIDEY FANS??,"Ok so as you may have read the reviews it is divided in 2 groups! The people who hated and the ones (like me) who loved it!First of all, BREAKING BAD FANS will be thrilled!! We really got excited the moment we saw the RV! Great great! (maybe you guys can add more stuff about BB so we'd come back!!)Second of all, the studio for sounds was great!Thirdly, our tour guide (Patrick) was great!Finally, best customer service! Free parking by the way (tip). Just go it is nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
40,Really fun,"We went on several tours on our recent trip to LA and this was our favorite. The tour guide was funny and personable. We were able to visit sets from The Goldbergs and Jeopardy, which was great. Since it is a walking tour, you are able to see a bit more than some of the tram tours. The tour guide definitely let us take our time taking pictures of everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannemF8498ME
50,The old MGM Studios,"A great tour, although our guide didn't seem particularly interested in either us or the studio!We did book in advance, which I think may be a requirement, but I'm not 100% on that.Parking is available under the studio building, and the tour is a walking tour, which crosses the road onto the studio lot.In spite of the guide, it is a fascinating tour. Lots of sound stages and the odd movie star, if you're lucky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulW374
50,"Not to be missed! Starstruck! Reserve ahead, free parking","Give yourself plenty of time to arrive as LA traffic is LA traffic and it can be, and usually is hectic. This, and Universal are our favorites and we take our out-of-state guests here.Enormous, sprawling, covered parking structure is Free and everyone knows parking is expensive in LA. Sony really accommodates disabled, challenged guests. That is the word, everyone here made us feel like a special guest. Imagine how many thousands of people they see every shift. Staggering.The staff? Pros! They all have a smile, and make everyone feel special and they are walking WikiPedias! The grounds are amazing, and the sets will impress everyone in your group. There is something for everybody. $40 admission and that is really reasonable for the experience and free parking.Breaking BAD RV is one of the new attractions that was not there last time we toured. Game shows galore and the vintage, old school Hollywood, very impressive.We enjoyed the Queen Latifah Stage. Her set is so enormous, elegant and was designed by rocker Lenny Kravitz. You may see filming and keep your eyes open as producers, stars are darting here and there. We saw a celeb getting in his car.Sony Studio Tour is fascinating. Remember this is Sony's World Headquarters and it is enormous, a compound. Wear comfortable shoes, clothing, and enjoy Culver City's many historical, and trendy new gems. Culver is a popular city with the locals so try to get some shopping, Tuesday afternoon Street Fair/ Farmers Market & dining in. Make the most of your Culver City experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalSiren
40,Great Tour!,"Took quite a while to get there as the traffic was bad, great to learn all about the history of the people who have passed through the famous buildings, saw the jeopardy set and the Ghost busters car which was awesome, not our favorite tour we did but if you have time we would recommend doing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeL247
50,a really good tour,"We booked this tour first out of all the hotel tours because it tends to have the least favourable reviews. However we were really happy with it. We got there late due to heavy traffic, but they allowed us to join anyways. We just missed the short video they show at the start.Once we crossed over from the office building to the studio (which is across the street), our guide walked us around and showed us some of the historic spots. We went into a very cool recording studio, and also a foley studio.We got to go into the set from the Goldbergs and saw one of the stars rehearsing some choreography. We also went onto the set of Jeopardy.We saw some historic vehicles including my very favourite, the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters, which has been restored and looks fantastic. That was a big highlight for me.Once the tour is over, there are a number of props and items on display in the lobby of the office. There are some items from movies like the Di Vinci Code, A League of their Own, a proton pack from Ghostbusters, and Andrew Garfield's skateboard from the Amazing Spiderman.We really enjoyed the tour and all the history in this historic studio. Please give yourself some extra time as traffic in the area is very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobOnLocation
50,"Taping of Jeopardy game show awesome experience, didn't go for studio tour","What a treat to see one of my favorite TV game shows being taped for future showingEveryone affiliated with Sony Entertainment and the Jeopardy crew were very nice and helpful.Be sure to contact the website to arrange for TV show tickets for when you are in the Los Angeles area.I was fortunate that a relative of my cousin's wife has a contact at the studio so that I could obtain a last minute ticket, what a treat!Alex Trebek was very down to earth speaking with the studio audience!Enjoyable educational entertainment at its bestüòÅ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MomNightowl
50,The BEST of the studio tours!,"Our guide Sam was upbeat, fun, and very informative. He made this the best of the studio tours (and I did all of them!) The variety of things that you get to see and experience makes this my favorite by far. We stood in the soundstage where Judy Garland performed ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", among many other famous movie scores performed on that very stage. We got to see where they make the sound effects for movies and tv shows, there are famous movie and tv cars they show you like the Ghostbusters, Breaking Bad (Walt's Pontiac and the RV), and more! If you are going to do a studio tour THIS is the one you want to do first! They even give you a free 8x10 souvenir photo! (no other tour does this!) They give you a free lanyard with your tour card to keep. Just a fun and interesting place to go. I would absolutely do this one again and I will request Sam! There is a wide variety of tv and movie memorabilia and sets (current shows and past!) The gift shops and FREE PARKING (also something the other tours do not have...free parking). Sony Pictures goes out of it's way to really make you feel like a VIP. You can even hang out in the reception area and buy souvenirs, have lunch, grab a coffee and enjoy props from Men In Black, Smurfs, and other great films. The studio is located in a gorgeous area and there is so much to see and do that I would spend a day here. Well worth going to. Cannot wait to go back again! THANK YOU SAM!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
50,enjoyable and informative,"We enjoyed this tour very much. Our guide, Kelly, was enthusiastic, well-spoken, and very knowledgeable about the myriad aspects of the studio‚Äôs operations. He also displayed a nice team spirit, always referring to the company as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and not ‚Äúthey,‚Äù yet he did not come across as a company ‚Äútool.‚Äù Aside from the tour itself, we appreciated Sony‚Äôs meticulous maintenance of its distinctive historic architecture. Our only disappointment was that we didn‚Äôt get to see a show actually being filmed, but apparently that doesn‚Äôt necessarily happen with any of the studios. We wholeheartedly recommend this tour, which by the way is the least expensive of the bunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LEB123
50,"Definite ""Don't Miss""!","My kids and I took this tour the other day. We were hoping to see some amazing things, and it did not disappoint. My 12 year old son was enthralled the entire trip. He is into video and music editing and enjoyed the sound and recording stages. He really could've stayed there all day. We were able to visit the set of a current TV show that he watches with us, and he was excited at being able to see how the sets were built, moved, and reused. The opportunities to see actual movie props was great. The Ghostbusters car, the Ecto 1, was a huge hit with the kids. Overall, our guide was very knowledgable, told us stories that kept us interested, and really tried to make the tour unique and interesting to our group. I can't imagine a better way to spend the afternoon if you're a movie buff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marianneg47
40,Better than Warner Bros,"My husband and I bought LA City Go Cards online and the Sony Pictures Tour and the Warner Bros Studio Tour both came with the day pass, so we did them both. I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about - this tour is 100% better than Warner Brothers. Warner Bros doesn't even take you on a real tv/movie set (just the outside fake streets/neighborhoods and they say ""Oh remember this scene from pretty little liars, it's filmed here"" and then they keep driving by). With Sony, we visited the ""house"" where they film the Goldbergs. We also go to view the sets where they film shows that have live audiences AND we got to see Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy. We also got to visit the room where they record all the sound and where they make sound effects. It is a lot of walking so be prepared for that. Either way, this tour is very different than Warner Bros so I think it'd be effective to visit both and decide for yourself which is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awayonadventure
20,The weakest of all the studio tours,"This is quite an interesting 2 hours but it is basically looking at empty soundstages and sitting on the set of Wheel of Fortune, where the staging had been taken to Hawaii for filming. The souvenir shops only had very large sizes of clothing, so if you are little there isn't much to buy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NettyPoole
30,Not really a movie tour,"I have gone on 3 studio tours, so I don't claim to be an expert on them in any way. I do know a little about movie and film history, so I base my opinion on how well a tour focuses on that interest. So, with that in mind, I was a little underwhelmed.First of all, this is the remaining real estate of the old MGM studio. It would be difficult to know that since the tours really do not spend much time talking about that fact. Maybe that is because in a way, MGM (as it exists today) is a competitor with Sony. That's unfortunate, because there is a lot more history behind the MGM name. A lot is made of the Columbia connection but Columbia, a Poverty Row studio back in the day, was and is not MGM. It's hard to relate to Columbia's history during the Golden Age of film on a walking tour of what used to be MGM!Okay - so clearly you aren't going to get a lot of your MGM fix on the Sony tour. What did I get? An awful lot of talk about some of the actors who MIGHT be seen on the set because at some time in the last few years they were working on the lot. Example? We were told that maybe...just maybe George Clooney might be seen because he did some post-production work a few years back. Hmmm. Maybe he forgot something and is coming back for it.There was an awful lot of this silliness. I guess if the tour is aimed at the casual tourist then it is fine, and maybe it is fun. But if you are there because you love film, and because you love classic film - well, not so much so.It was nice seeing the surviving buildings, though. There are a lot of remaining Art Deco touches that are cool to see. Visiting the recording studio where so many stars spent time was cool. Pretty sure there was some recording work going on for Into the Woods, and that was neat.There were some hit and run visits into a couple of soundstages, some with famous pedigrees (like 14, 15 and 30 - Wizard of Oz and a lot of Esther Williams movies for the latter). Again, not a lot of talk about the old MGM movies and a lot about the TV shows filming there. You get to visit the Wheel of Fortune set (no photos allowed on set) and the Jeopardy set (photos encouraged). That was interesting. The Queen Latifah set was as boring as visiting the Dr. Phil set at Paramount. Oh, well.Towards the end there is a short stop to hit their studio shop. Not too much there, I thought, and if you buy a DVD there is no discount like at Paramount!I would echo some of the other reviewers suggestions. If you are visiting studios, hit Sony first. The rest are going to be better.A tip: Unlike the other tours, the groups meet in the lobby of Sony Picture Entertainment headquarters. There is a small cafe in the lobby that is actually very good. It was good enough that the next week I brought my wife there for lunch while I went on my own walking tour of the Culver Studios area (aka the old Ince, Desilu, RKO, Selznick, etc. lot). Excellent food and they gave the employee discount to us each time.Another tip - take the time to walk around to look at the old facade on Washington and the gate around the corner. The old back lot is, of course, long gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hounddog62
20,Disappointed,"I didn't hate it but was disappointed in this tour. We walked around alot of buildings and saw the outside of them. Saw a few cars from movies that were there for eye candy for the tours. We were taken into some voice/music recording studios but they did not let you hear anything. It would have been cool to hear a snippet of a recording. We saw the set of Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune and Queen Latifah's talk show. We were taken into one older building where they have some old Oscars, which was cool. We talked to the guards, who stated Will Smith was the nicest celeb he met. Nothing of the old MGM, no movie sets, no props, nothing inside movies. I felt like it was a so called tour cuz they ""have to have a tour"". Would not recommend and would not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halllis
50,Celeb Sighting!,"My son and I did the walking tour at Sony after being crammed in three to a golf cart seat at WB. This was so much better. Our guide, Tony, was amazing. We saw the sets for Queen Latifah and Wheel of Fortune. The best part? We saw/talked to a couple of the stars of The Goldbergs! So friendly! This was probably one of my favorite moments in 8 days in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adseaba
40,Not as good as WB,"The WB saw better sets and was worth the time. I am glad we did both, but I wish we had done this one first so I wouldn't have been disappointed compared to WB.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57ElizabethK
40,Good - Would Have Enjoyed a Bit More of the Old MGM,"As part of our Laurel and Hardywood Convention, we booked a tour at Sony. Sony Pictures is located on the old MGM studio lots, and we were shown many of the ""older"" buildings named after many of the older stars from days gone by. I thought there would be a bit more regarding the ""old MGM"" years than there was. We visited the Foley Studio where the noise effects are created, the sound stage where Judy Garland recorded ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" (which was special) and where John Williams recorded many movie scores and, and later the company who creates and paints the traditional canvas artistic backdrops. As far as TV, we did see the sound stage for the Queen Latifa show and, of course, Jeopardy. We spent most of the tour walking around the outside of sound stages and hearing about them instead of going inside, with few exceptions. Still, the guide was informative and friendly. One disappointment for me was the lack of ability to take pictures; at Warner Brothers, they just said said to take all the pictures you wanted, with few exceptions. At Sony, there were few exceptions where you were allowed to even take a picture. Strange. Remember, this is a walking tour, so wear comfortable shoes. FYI - My wife liked the Sony Tour most; I liked the Warner Brothers Tour better. However, we liked them both, so you can't go wrong! My wife would have given it a 5, but I gave it a 4; after all, I'm doing the writing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117carla
50,Very good tour,"There is a lot of negative reviews about this tour, but I found this an excellent tour. Its a walking tour, starting in a modern headquarters, we got on to the sets of the Queen Latifa show, Wheel of Fortune and Masters of Sex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845andreww
10,Not worth your time,"I never write reviews but am compelled to do so today. This tour was a disappointment. Having been to the Warner tour I was expecting so much more to share my husband. The lobby is the best part of whole tour and you can see all that free without a ticket. You do not see anything on this tour except a lot of outside buildings and your tour guide describing what happens inside. Really ??. No yellow brick road, no wheel of fortune, no jeapardy set. Nice to learn that studio 15 is the tallest or studio 21 the longest. Really. A sound stage - don't touch the chairs- a cafeteria under construction. A lobby where deals are made.... Oh don't forget you can learn who came in the door. It was a hot day , lots of walking and talking Not much to see. I would not recommend this tour. I guess the saying goes... You get what you pay for. So disappointed. Felt like a bait and switch from what you read on line. Save your money for a good dinner in culver city. Lots of great restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/102ginar
20,Go and do the Paramount Tour - it is much better value for money,I did this tour a couple of weeks ago whilst on holiday in LA.I had done the Paramount Studio tour 3 years ago on a previous trip and so I was really disappointed by the Sony tour.There was nothing wrong with the guide but we had to walk everywhere whereas at Paramount you are taken around on one of the little buggy carts.I also felt the guide was a bit too over the top in ensuring no-one had wandered off anywhere and after an hour or so I started to find this irritating. If security is really THAT strict then don't allow people on the premises!Overall I just felt the trip was quite disjointed and halfway around I was rather bored.I don't think it was good value for money AT ALL.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/One-and-Only-Aly-G
50,Highly informative tour,"A great way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the sound stages and memorabilia of Sony pictures. The tour starts with a 20 minute film looking back at the history of Sony, you then get a guided tour of the studios. We did both this and the Warner Bros VIP tour and would highly recommend them both.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lukki777
50,EXCELLENT!,"We had low expectations of this tour given the comparatively moderate price tag, but were very pleasantly surprised. If you park underneath the facility, valet parking is included, and before or after your your, if you are hungry do stop at the atrium cafe. The food is inspired by Wolfgang Puck and is definitely a cut above regular cafeteria offerings. Back to the tour, then. It starts with an interesting and nostalgic short video about the history of the lot, and then you are assigned your guide. Ours, a young man named Sam, was bright and personable and made everyone feel welcome. We visited the sets of Jeopardy and the Queen Latifah Show, and saw the famous RV and SUV from Breaking Bad. A completely unexpected treat for us was a visit to two sets of Masters of Sex; one used in the first series, and the other that will appear in series two. As this was the first day that the set was available to visit, the interiors did not have any coverings and we were able to see them as they appear in the show, which is one of our favourites. The guide's commentary was informative and of course the lot itself provided all the nostalgia that any TV/film buff could ask for. We took this tour expecting it to be just a 'filler' but it turned our to be one of our most memorable tour experiences. Definitely recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BerlitzTraveller
40,Very informative,"We have previously visited Warner brothers and paramount tours. This one is similar. Sam was our guide and he was very informative and funny. We saw the queen latifah studio, and jeopardy studio. We also were taken to the Barbara Streisand sound set. It is old and amazing to see. The tour takes approx two hours. You are moved along at a pace, but it's only to pack in more sights. At the end we were lucky to see Seth Rogen as he quickly passed by the ogling tourists. That made our day to see a celeb.Thanks Sam, for a great tour looking for ""ice creams"" (tour group joke).Tip: give yourself time to arrive and park your car. The parking entrance is not exactly at the address provided for the studio, although it is around the corner beside the new style building. Also, cameras are allowed to be used at specific parts of the tour, but no movie cameras at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonP523
20,only if you have nothing to do,"least enjoyed tour out of all the studio tours available in the Hollywood/LA area.Visited week of June 9th 2014.Parking lot attendant below main building in booth at entrance should find another job,acted like we were bothering him reading his newspaper when we had questions about parking.1/2 video at beginning of tour made you feel like you will see something spectacular,WRONG.Complete walking tour,if you were in a golf cart you could see all of it in 30 minutes.Tour guide was polite,but what you get to see sucks.Actually there is nothing to see but the Jeopardy set and Dr Phil stage ., Wheel Of fortune set was closed,We felt rushed and were constantly told to keep a fast pace since he had another tour to do.Anyone reading / searching for tours to do on your get away, step away from your PC if Sony is in the search bar.For 7 of us it was around $280.00.I felt better paying a $53.00 parking ticket in Santa Monica at the Pier after sunset limit, but that is another story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajung
50,Loved this studio tour with Tony,"We were in L.A. in mid-May and wanted to do a studio tour. We chose the Sony Studios because it has the most stages and is a working studio. Universal Studios was our first pick, but it seemed kind of cheesy. (You can catch the highlights on YouTube.) When we were there, they had just wrapped up Masters of Sex, and had the backdrops out, as well as the cars on the lot for the main characters and era. Also, they were currently shooting Ray Donovan with Liev Schreiber. We made it onto the set of Jeopardy and the Queen Latifah Show (both had wrapped up for the summer, but the sets were cool!), and Lenny Kravitz designed her set. We went to the sound room where all sounds are re-recorded after a movie is shot (They had a piece of wood on the floor that was used for the sound of the dancing scene in Titanic and other cool items. Seems like that would be an awesome job!) We went to the artist's studio where they paint canvas for backdrops. They still use these versus using digital images because it looks better on camera. The voice-over room is where the actors do their voice work, and you will see the on-site facades that they use over and over for all kinds of things. Californication is filmed there as well, and I just noticed a few episodes ago that they used the grounds at Sony for the ""Santa Monica Cop"" offices. If you ever see a scene where the building looks familiar, it may be Sony Studios. You will see a few props from Breaking Bad (my favorite!) and Ghostbusters. Lots of history here, and if you have Tony as your guide, he will throw some trivia questions your way. A few celebrities who are currently under contract have parking spaces and offices here as well. Depending on the day and who is filming, you may see someone on the lot, so keep your eyes open. Tony was great, and gave us about 30 minutes more than we paid for. He will mention the sites around the lot that have been used for several popular movies. If you like the behind the scenes stuff that goes into movie making, you will like this tour. FYI - the commissary (cafeteria) in the main building where the tour starts is really good. Good food for the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dbamtm
40,Worthwhile Tour,"This was our first tour while visiting L.A on vacation. We booked our tickets on line just to make sure we were able to secure a spot. Parking is free but valet only. The Sony building is huge on the inside and there's lots of movie memorabilia everywhere. The tour is about 2 1/2 hours long and is a walking tour. It starts out by watching a short movie of the history of Sony and MGM. Next your led across the street into the back lot area. You get to see all the best picture Oscars won by the studio and learn lots of history about their movies. We saw several different stage buildings where the movies like Castaway, Men in Black, Wizard of Oz and others were made. We visited a sound stage where Judy Garland sang ""Over the Rainbow"" too. We also got to see some cars used in movies and TV, like the Ghostbusters car, Breaking Bad motorhome, Telladaga Nights NASCAR car and others. The tour also leads you onto the Jeopardy set. We had a great time. Our tour guide was very patient and knowledgeable and answered all our questions. They took our picture at the beginning of the tour and after it was over we got to keep it and the tour lanyard for free. If your in the area I suggest you do the Sony Tour and learn some great movie history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aerowing
50,More Than a Studio,"Sony Pictures is located on the old MGM studio lots. Where Ester William's sound stages were. The Studio was completely revamped several years ago and now it is a terrific complex of buildings as well as sound stages. I like to get gelato, sit under a tree and just enjoy being there.Take the tour and then stroll around. Don't miss the Studio Store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
50,``We`re on the move`` with TONY - awesome tour!,"As a travel agent I like to experience new excursions when travelling to LA, so on a recent trip to LA with my family (2 adults and 2 kids age 19 and 21) we decided to visit SONY STUDIOS. Our Tour Guide Tony was an amazing - funny, friendly, knowledgeable and totally loves his job! We experienced things you won`t experience on other studio tours. The Barbara Streisand Scoring Stage was sooooo cool - my goodness people it is where Judy Garland recorded OVER THE RAINBOW!! And Stage 15 is where Wizard of Oz was filmed. We saw the sets for Queen Latifah Show, Jeopardy...very interesting! They even took a family picture of us that looked like we WON on WHEEL of FORTUNE...hilarious!! We have done other studio tours and this one is highly recommended! Thanks Tony for a great morning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/presley1977
30,A little short of expectations,"I purchased tickets on line to reserve the date and time I wanted. Valet parking was convenient in the Sony garage for no extra charge. A picture was taken in front of green screen at start and then set on Wheel of Fortune background, again no extra charge. Video at the start was fine, but then the 2 hour tour consisted mostly of walking around the studio property. Entered the Jeopardy and Queen Latifah sets, but would have liked more for the time and cost of the tour. I did like getting a picture with the Breaking Bad Winnebago. Overall, ok but not a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C917MKdavidm
50,The real behind the scene studio tour,"I've been in all 4 studio (Universal, Sony, Warner, Paramount) and I must tell, all are different.At Sony they guide you trough the lot while they show how and where they mix the sound and sound effects! If you like Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy don't miss it, because you can enter in both sets.During the tour you can hear a lot of information how they do things to look like that in the movies, but they won't let you go into stages.Big point you can shop in the gift shop for the employee price which is really reasonable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgama87
50,Fantastic and so interesting,"We had a really good visit at these studios, Tony, our guide was full of enthusiasm, shared many interesting facts interspersed with anecdotes. He got to know everyone s name on the tour addressing individuals from time to time which kept interest. He asked questions, asked for people s comments and made us laugh. The only downside was that we couldn't t go into many studios but were able to see the amazing folk that build the sets etc. Thank you Tony.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162kerenb
30,Technologically Informative and historically interesting.,"This was our first studio tour so I had nothing for a comparison. Parking is free which is a solid plus. You valet park under the main office building taking the elevator up to check in. Here they take a photo of you and your party which you receive at no charge at the end if the 2 1/2 hour tour. Next you will view a short historical film of MGM to include background on the current owner, Sony. Then you will take a walking tour of some of the grounds and sound stages where the guide will provide some historical perspective and film making technology. Towards the end of the tour you will walk up about 4 flights of stairs to see a number of hand painted backdrops. Worth the trip up, however if you have problems with stairs you may wish to skip this portion. Lastly, you will have some time to visit the mandatory gift store and ice cream shop. We did not see any famous Hollywood stars, although it is a possibility. Only children 12 and over may take the tour. Recommend it if you have time. You will have to reserve your $38 ticket in advance either on-line or by calling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460terryb
10,Huge Disappointment,"Perhaps the worst tour we've ever taken and since we've been traveling the US and Europe for many years, that's saying a lot! Very little information about film making. Walked around the outside of sound studios, not taken into any of them. A star struck guide who spoke of celebrities who stood where we were standing and not much else. I don't write many reviews and I hate to write a bad one but this was a complete waste of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sailingandrving
50,A GREAT COMPLIMENT TO THE WARNER TOUR,"I bought a smart destination card (Highly recommended) which included this tour and Sony Pictures. This tour was more technical than the Warner Tour, it was like they evened each other out. I liked the free valet parking, very cool. Also it gave me more than I was expecting. I didn't know that Sony was involved in so many hits. It was cool to stand in the room where The Simpsons Intro was scored, we got to go in a sound room where they record things like people drinking water to keys being dropped on a table. Buy a smart destinations car and see both studios you will not regret it. They have a Nazi style picture policy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayR1984
40,Very interesting,"Because the Sony lot is smaller than several of the other in the LA area (Warner Brothers, Paramount, etc), the tour is much less about showing you WHERE things are done in the backlot and much more about HOW they are done, which we thought was a nice change of pace. We especially enjoyed visiting the Foley Studio where the noise effects are created, the sound stage where Judy Garland recorded ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and the company who creates and paints the traditional canvas artistic backdrops. As you are walking around the grounds rather than on a tram, you didn't feel quite as much like ""tourist"" the whole time. Jamie Lee Curtis was even kind enough to stop and chat and take photos with the group for a moment! If you are looking for a ton of photo ops of buildings and sets from movies and tv shows, you should do one of the other tours. This one is great for those who want to understand a little more about the nuts and bolts of movie/tv production. Oh, and parking is free under the Sony building..and you can leave your car there after your tour while you go for lunch in Culver City!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mninnhn
40,Good time!,"Our work staff was visiting the L.A. area and decided to do the tour. We had a large group of 25, so we booked a catered lunch and group tour. Our plan was to head straight from LAX to Sony, eat a leisurely lunch and then start the tour. Unfortunately, we had a slight issue at the airport which delayed us longer than expected. I called the studio to let them know our group would arrive about 30 minutes later than scheduled and they were pleasant and very accommodating. Lunch was ready and waiting for us on arrival! The food was great! Patrick was our tour guide and he did a great job! He was very knowledgable, personable and funny! Although we did not see any stars on the tour, we learned a lot about the making of movies, sound effects, etc. All in all it was a good time and would definitely recommend this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracym346
30,Lots you can't see,"Like another review said - lots of time walking around the outside of sound studios and not seeing what is going on inside. Did get to see inside the scoring studio and Sound effects studio. But just see it, not hear it.Wheel of fur tune set was covered up (tapped every second Thurs and Fri) so its covered up rest of the time. For those who love Wheel and Jeopardy, you may be dissapointed seeing what it really looks like with lights camera action.However, easy (free valet) parking offered. They do not cater for children under 12. Allow 2.5hrs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351wadet
50,Sony studio tour,Tony was awesome! He really gave good information about all aspects of movie making. We even saw a tv star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lampj
50,Saw Adam sandler,This tour was incredible. When you get there a valet parks your car for free. Then when we go into the main lobby where the goldbergs are filming a scene there. Next the tour takes us around the lot where we see Adam sandlers production company and Adam sandler himself. The other exciting part is when we were able to see the set of the new show rake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727cindyd
50,Great tour with fun guide,"Start by giving a shout out to TONY from Philly for a great tour - ""People we are on the Move"". He did great job asking questions and learning the audiences name. Great walking tour and really get to see a lot of the behind the scenes things that go on with making a TV show or movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ponderthistp
50,great tour,"The Sony Movie Studio was a great tour. The guide was very knowledgeable, gave us insider stories, and obviously loved sharing the history of the studio with us. I would recommend this tour to all movie buffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyhutch2016
40,Jeopardy Taping,"Me and my wife actually had 2 tickets bought to the studio tour, but then we were accepted to getting tickets to Jeopardy. After reading reviews on here about the actual tour, and me being a jeopardy fan, i opted to do the jeopardy.We had a great time, what an experience to see it live! Definitely recommend people going to see this taping if they are fans of the show.The only sucky thing was they say on the tickets no cameras or everything so we left ours in the car. When you walk into the stage there are cool things to take pictures of and people were allowed to with their cell phones. i got some serious FOMO (fear of missing out) from this :( but oh well, the taping was still great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cksteeve

50,Know what you are getting.,This is not like universal with rides and gift shops at every turn it is a working studio.it is a place where the greatest films were made.just like if you go to a roman ruin you are there for the history of a place.if you stand at the entrance to the stage where the wizard of oz or where they filmed the fight scene of rocky 4 or where johnny wiesmuller swang thru trees you get a sence of how important these old sounstages are.our guide tony was superb.hilarious and very informative.oh and make sure u splash some green for these guys you deadbeats.tony you rock! Richie from london.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richiekat
20,Only Go If You're Curious To See Where MGM Was,"Compared to the Warner Brothers and Paramount tours, this was poor. We spent most of the tour walking around the outside of sound stages hearing about them instead of going in. The best part of the tour was getting to see the scoring studio where John Williams recorded many movie scores and where Judy Garland recorded ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". However, this was a rare occasion. Chances are you won't get to see this. The only other high point was seeing the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune studios. They should at least let you see one of the sound stages used in ""The Wizard of Oz"" so you can get an idea of what it would have looked like when they shot it. Part of the problem is that most of the original MGM lot has been sold off over the years and the studio has changed hands many times. As a result, there's hardly any backlot. If you want to go, I recommend getting the Go Pass because this tour is included.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VinnyDrysdale
40,Watch taping of Jeopardy shows,"We reserved free tickets several weeks in advance to sit in the studio audience for the taping of several episodes of Jeopardy. For our session, there were two shows recorded.We found the production of the shows was interestng and entertaining. Even had a few retakes. Alex Trebek engages in a friendly manner with the studio office and takes questions.Parking is onsite and nearby and there was about an hour wait to get in. There were a few empty seats for our tapings.....not sure if that usually happens.Recommend if you have interest in the show.We did not take the Sony Studios tour and had not planned to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packcal
50,Sony Studio Tour,"Enjoyable! Excellent bargain when using the Go Los Angeles card. We called at the last minute and made it to the Monday 9 A.M. tour. Awesome for movie fans. Props from Men in Black 3 in the lobby to peruse while waiting for the tour to begin. Upscale cafeteria in the lobby. This is a walking tour, so wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyH224
10,What a waste of time,"Don't go to these studios if you think you are going to see anything relevant to the old MGM musicals. There is little refference to MGM and it's all about Sony, which let's face it have very little history in Hollywood. The guide was terrible, there was no talking with the guests, just talking at us. No mention of Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Fred Astaire etc... such a letdown. All the old sets have been pulled down, not even a bit of the yellow brick road remains. Sony don't realise they are sitting on a goldmine and OH NO PHOTOS allowed unless you asked the guide!A total waste of time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsilverspice
50,Sony Pictures,"Visit Sony Pictures for an amazing day. So much to see and do, take the tour, enjoy all the special sights... stop for a coffee, tea or something cold. Enjoy all there is to offer at this wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emayer56
40,"Interesting history, would have liked to see more","Our tour guide (Will) was excellent: knowledgeable and entertaining. For $40, I would have liked to see more. The foley studio was fascinating, and I enjoyed Will's insights into how the entertainment business works. We saw one set in progress and the Jeopardy museum. Got a few photos with the Breaking Bad RV and Green Hornet car. Pretty good tour, and interesting to learn more about the city I live in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zootnarf
20,Don't waste your money,"We did the Sony tour on August 7. Although our tour guide was very nice, we were very disappointed in the tour and it was not worth the $38 per person. We did not see any soundstages as some other reviewers have seen. We did not see any sets or backdrop artists. We saw the short film they show everyone at the start that gives the history of the studio. We saw a lobby with the Oscar statues displayed. We walked around and saw the outside of many buildings. The only rooms we went inside were the room where they do the sound effects and a warehouse where they store the backdrops. We did see a lobby/museum of the Jeopardy show but no Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune set. At the end we saw the green hornet car and two cars from Breaking Bad that were parked outside for our benefit I guess. We did get the photo of our family that is included but overall was a letdown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanc162
20,Must NOT See,"If you look on their website it says stuff about min (men in black), wizard of oz, Spider-Man, jeopardy, and wheel of fourtune. It is all baloney. I went August 9th 2013 we saw none of those movie sets on the jeopardy set the were renovating it so we saw a lousy ""museum"" about the show, on wheel of fourtune watch it 2-3 weeks in advanced and if they are doing a special somewhere other than l.a. Be prepared to just see some boxes, and we wasted just about 30 minutes talking to a security guard. The other time was spent in these little rooms that help make movies. If you want another tour try Warner bros. it is much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/819JonB
40,It's a fun tour of the former MGM Studio Lot,"It's a fun tour, especially if your a fan of the old MGM movies and want to see a backlot that goes back to the original Thomas Ince Studio in 1915 or so. I'm a long time resident, so have been on the tour when it was run by studio volunteer docents, rather than commerically as it is now. They knew a lot of the studio history better. So it might be more enjoyable if you study up a little before you go. Because it is a working studio, what you see varies from tour to tour, depending on what is available. A few favorite locations are the pool sound stage where the Esther Williams musicals were made, the Scenic Backdrop painting building, and the Barbara Streisand sound stage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3DDavid
40,The Home of Screenland,"Sony Pictures Entertainment, continues a more the 90 year history of movie making in Culver City. A tour of the studios is steeped in history and keeps your attention throughout. The tour directors are Studio employees who are articulate and well informed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindza
50,A very nice tour,We booked this through the use of a Go LA card. It was a great experience . A wonderful 2 hour walking tour of the studios. Plus they gave us a great free picture to remember our experience . We did the 10:30 tour then stayed for lunch which was healthy and inexpensive . I would recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see how movies and television shoes are made.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chelstin
30,"If you are a MGM buff and came to see MGM, you will be disappointed","This is not a bad studio tour. Our guide, Patrick, was energetic and very knowledgeable. The problem with this tour is if you came to see the great, historic backlot of MGM you are going to be disappointed. For the casual tourist, the guide would seem to have a good depth of knowledge of the history of MGM and Columbia/Sony (who eventually acquired what was left of the property after a huge sell off years ago). For someone who has done a decent amount of reading and research, they will find that the guide gave the Readers Digest version and didn't offer any inside information or anything new. In fact, most of the history the guide repeated could be found by watching the box set of MGM: When the Lion Roars that was released in the 1990's. We did get to see the Streisand Scoring Soundstage which was interesting. The Jeopardy set was being redone so that wasn't much to see. The outdoor street set was nothing compared to what you would see at Paramount. Seeing the Thalberg building and the Oscars for Columbia was interesting. You will not see a commissary, rows of dressing rooms, the school for contract players or anything else related to MGM in the glory days. BUT if you never knew those things were there, you would never miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blumagoo
20,Guide fun.. Tour not!,"We did this tour with friends visiting from out of town. We saw closed buildings and a sound stage where the set of Jeopardy was being rebuilt so there was nothing to see. Even the gift shop was lame. It was certainly not as good as other movie tours. A lot of history about MGM was given ,but the rest of the tour was spent walking 2 miles ( according to my pedometer) around closed buildings, boring! Miss this tour! Our guide was energetic and funny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harrodsfan
40,Follow the yellow brick road.,"Ok you won't see the Yellow brick road but you will see where this movie was filmed because this used to be MGM studios. We saw cars from movies, stages and learned how music is added to movies. We did go inside the Barbara Streisand sound stage where all the other movie studios also come to add music to their movies. It was a wonderful tour with a very knowledgeable tour guide. We did go inside the Jeopardy stage. This is a walking tour so wear comfortable shoes. We were also treated to seeing the only place in the United States now that you can get a backdrop for a movie. I liked it and I do recommend this. $35 per person",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniem467
10,You Don't get What You Paid For!,"As someone else reviewed, 2 hours of walking narrow alleys around locked sound stages with the guide telling you what was filmed. Even the Jeopardy set which is the only thing you can visit was removed as they are changing the set. Probably the best part was paying $35 (+ticket fee even though you get the ticket there) to see Sony's latest movie trailer ""advertisement"". There excuse of course is it's a working lot. I've been on lots of ""working"" tours of Breweries, Steel Mills, Bakeries, Shipping Ports etc. and this is the worst one I've ever seen and all of the others were free. Save your money, read about it on wikipedia and you'll be way ahead on time and money. On the bright side I did get to see some junk cars and an old Winebago from some cable show I never heard of before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillL742
50,A must see for movie buffs,"This was my second time on the tour, and my mothers first. She is a huge movie buff and when she found out that this is still an active lot and was also the former MGM Studio, she was beyond excited.Our tour guide was Will, he brought the tour to life by incorporating our group into different ""scenarios"". At first I was not sure where he was going with it, but then he wove it in to the overall experience by having the group act in different roles, it made a lot of sense and was fun.For the Breaking Bad fans, the iconic trailer (with the bullet holes) and Walt's ugly car are both on the lot!Be prepared to do a lot of walking, bring a camera, and enjoy the tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieJay
50,Do NOT Miss This,"This is one of the best tours that I have ever taken. Our guide, Tony - rhymes with Sony, was fantastic. He made the tour so personal by greeting each guest by name, and he brought the studio to life with his love of movies, music, and TV. You were able to see so much within the two hour tour (it is a walking tour). You are literally transported to another time dimension as you walk through the lot with all of its splendor. You visit the sets of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy.It is easy to get here, and once you do, parking is available. Plus, the valet gets your car for you at the end of the tour. There is even a complimentary Sony picture of your party for you to take home. Don't miss this tour if your are in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741lucillem
30,Unless you're a fan of Jeopardy.....,"Took this tour thinking that because it was a walking tour you'd be able to see more studio details. Nope, most buildings were closed and locked. Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy is the big highlight of the tour. 25 minutes just in the Jeopardy building. Was very difficult to take up the full two hours of walking. Happy Madison (Adam Sandler) building was a curiousity but still, no going in etc.Brought teens with us that aren't into game shows and there really wasn't anything of interest for them or us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpattison
50,This one is worth the money,"I am always reluctant to take studio tours. They tend to be ""Theme Park Light"" and no real sense that you're on a film set. The Sony tour is different. You get a thorough history of the location and very interesting interaction with the various sets and studios. You can see the stars between sets and the feeling is that you're an intimate part of the whole production. Our tour guide was really well informed, entertaining and genuinely friendly. I highly recommend the tour, despite the $35 price tag.The tour is a full two hours with about two miles of walking, so be prepared for that. One member of our tour get leg cramps near the end and had to hobble in pain the rest of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMETravel
20,Not much to see on the tour but the outside of locked sound stages and offices.,"The 2 hour walking tour walks among locked sound stages as a guide tells you the names of movies that were filmed there. Boring as you don't really get behind the scenes on any real movie set. We did get a brief visit to the Jeopardy set, which was drapped over with covers, and a brief visit into a sound stage where a pilot was going to be filmed. Again, pretty dull and uninformative about what goes on there. Save your money. Warner Brothers Studios was a much better tour with a real backlot of movie sets and visits into current sets like Big Bang and Mentalist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Basinman
50,A great time,Awesome experience with a knowledgeable tour guide..definitely worth the time. Friendly and engaging.. Age appropriate for older kids and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ali17brown
40,Tour Not Great - Opportunity to get into old MGM -- Wondeful,"Having been on the Paramount Tour and really enjoying that and the feel of old Hollywood, this was not the same. Our tour guide was a bit self-impressed and spent a lot of time having a select group of people from the tour do ""play acting"" with actors, a producer, etc. That felt like a waste of time and was not entertaining or enjoyable. That being said, the opportunity to be on the old MGM studio site was a thrill for us - from the Thalberg building to the site of the old school room and sound stages. So, if you're a fan of MGM, you may want to go here (even though not much is said about it, and not much is left of it), otherwise, I would recommend the Paramount Tour over this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripleDeckers
50,"2 hours ""backstage""","Check out Sony Studio Tours when you are in LA. You get the history of the studio property, a lot about movie making (did you know EVERY sound in a movie is ""enhanced"" - meaning it is recreated in a studio?), and a chance to see a star or two (we didn't, but it could happen...) We had a great guide (Will), and it was so very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyS610
50,Great Tour,"I really enjoyed the Sony Studio tour. Our tour guide was very good and knew a lot of trivial information that always make tours special. The tour itself was great and I got to see the sets of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy. Sorry to say, I didn't see any movie stars. :( When the tour was over, they gave you a complimentary picture with studio highlight pictures. Most places try to charge you a silly amount of money for those type of pictures. It was a walking tour so some people might have a hard time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SabinaM843
10,You get what you pay for,"This was a more affordable tour and it seems you get what you pay for. We were expecting to see some backstage things but unfortunately all we did was walk around and see the outside of sound studios. The basic premise of the tour was ""last week they had this really cool thing in here!"" Or ""last month Cameron Diaz was here!"" So are we just supposed to use our imagination? Basically everything seemed like bs and the tour guide stuck to the mantra ""we can't interrupt production"". So not sure what we were paying for exactly.... Skip this one and try something else. It must be worth the extra $30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChipNJessS
40,Worth checking out,My wife and I were looking for something to kill time before we flew out to Tahiti later in the day and the two hour tour at Sony Studios was great. The price was very reasonable at $35 and the tour guide was very informative. If you like getting a real behind the scenes experience this is the place to go. We actually got to walk on the Jeopardy set and see where they produce the Wheel of Fortune. One of my favorite parts was seeing the old Ghostbusters vehicle. Overall I give the tour and A. Check it out if you are looking for something to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayhawker4Life1
20,Nothing to See Here,"A very long walking tour of very little, but, a few sound stages. No glamor and not one star siting!Luckily we got the tour for free, would have been disappointed if we had paid for it. Pass this one up. Go to Universal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyjudyjudy9
30,Unexpensive and nice,"If you want to do this tour you don't need to pay in advance,just leave your name and they'll reply to your e-mail with the confirmation n. you pay $35 and you have FREE parking included,the tour is very nice, you are gonna visit all the old MGM studios wich is now SONY PICTURES ENTERTEINMENT",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piercov
40,It is all make believe,"This is a very nice two hour tour and a resonable ($35) price. Our guide was excellent. We saw a sound studio and several sets including those for Wheel of Fortune and Rules of Engagement. Even parts of the studio's office complex are used as sets. Hollywood does a great job making it all look real. You get a souvenir photo included in the entry fee. However, we went with another couple and the four of us were only given one picture. We had to pay for another copy. Parking was free, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayakerbob
20,Very Belated Review for Sony Pictures Tour,"I went on this tour in April of 2008. I was beyond excited because of the lot's MGM history. But just like one recent reviewer said, with all it's iconic history all the amazing Hollywood stories that they can tell you that took place in the buildings that are still standing. They prefer to tell you about Adam Sandler's offices and basketball court. Esther William's pool is STILL on stage 30, didn't let us see it. The famous MGM commissary is still there, didn't let us see it. Inside the Thalberg building is what was Louis B Mayer's office.. won't let you see it. The guide took us to the ""old part of the lot behind the collonade that they won't let them tear down because it's historic"" grudgingly and pointed out a few historic buildings like dressing room row (removed in 2009.. I guess it wasn't historic enough huh?). He was very annoyed to speak about the lot's OLD history, but he asked us very excitedly if we would like to see the white back drop they use for Apple commercials?!? really? This tour has sooo much positional for true vintage Hollywood lovers like me. But they miss their chance at every turn. I gave it 2 stars just because I got to even be on the famed lot. Not worth the price, and every year they tear down more history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTownsend666
30,So So tour,"The tour was about 2 hours and we saw a lot of the outside of stage buildings. We saw a sound recording room, a mixing theater where they play the movie and mix and add sound, the stage of Wheel of Fortune that was under construction and peeked in a door where they were building a stage for The Voice. Other than that we walked by the buildings and the guide said this is the Gable building, Striesand recording stage, Merna Loy building, etc. The guide kept saying no hurry but we have to move on. Even when we stopped to buy yogurt he stopped at the table and said no hurry but we have to move in in 3 minutes. Not enough time to gulp down the yogurt. Nothing of substance. I don't know about the Paramount, WB or Culver City Studio tours but I might try them first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2010Escape
40,Behind the scenes adventure,"We were greeted by a very informed guide. He took us through various building then took us to the sound studios of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy. The studios are not air conditioned since we were there when they were not filming a show. There is a bit of walking and if you are not able bodied, it might be too much for you. The guide also showed us how they change storefronts to fit different story lines. Very nice tour. The guide is very happy to receive tips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shopper114
20,Worst of the studio tours,"I think other than seeing the coverd up sets of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, most folks only get to see an often empty large stage and some Oscars. They also don't allow photos in many areas.Best part of the tour is a Sony employee store on the lot with excellent prices on cameras and TVs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonaldW_12
30,Tour was average.,I am sure it could be good if the studio is busy. We went mid week and it was empty. We didn't get to see too much so it was average for a studio tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shipdad
20,Pales in comparison to Universal and Paramount Tours,"You get what you pay for. The lobby has more movie memorabilia than you will see on the tour. You get to take very few pictures. They take you into empty sound stages??? The Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy sets have everything covered-you don't get to see the wheel, puzzle board or the jeopardy board. We saw the building exterior from Spiderman and the Smurfs but you couldn't take pictures. Learned some interesting facts...that's about it. Chet the tour guide was good. Go on Universal and Paramount tours...you'll get to take tons of pictures...much more exciting. This was on the boring side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimT165
40,Cool Tour... Not So Cool Guide,"The Sony Pictures Studio tour in Culver City, California was very interesting on many fronts. The studios are awesome... we went on the set of a few tv shows including Jeopardy! We also went on some sound stages.... We were in the same studio where the whole Rocky soundtrack was recorded. Our tour guide was ok but did not seem very interested in talking much to the guests. Half of the time he was looking at his cell phone. Overall seeing the studios were really cool... I would have just preferred a more excited Tour guide!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daburg234
50,I had a great time!,"I loved this tour. I went today and Chet was awesome! We got to see the sets of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, a NYC set, a sound mixing room, and cars from Green Hornet and Ghostbusters. I loved the yogurt store and the free posters given out at the end. The video at the start was great too, and after it ended, we saw two trailers. I remember the last one being Here Comes the Boom, which I want to see! I would recommend to anyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyShimmer
20,Empty Stucco'd Warehouses and Souvenir Shops,"This was a disappointing tour. Chet the tour guide gamely led us on a long walk on the corporate campus despite there being little going on. A kid in our group of 20+ tourists practically begged for some kid stuff or recent film sets to see to no avail.Not a good tour for youngsters.The Jeopardy set was covered in tarps, the Busby Berkley and Wizard of Oz film stages were empty and void of anything to marvel at. You had to try to imagine the floors opeing up revealing the swimming pool used by Frank Capra in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in another yet barren warehouse. The warehouses now have had a south florida makeover with taupe and pink stucco'd exteriors. There was no sense of history at all walking around there, it felt like an American Shopping Mall.Our tour was crashed by two interlopers who hadn't paid and yet boldly asked why contestants on Wheel of Fortune yell vowels at the wheel. Dumb question but an interesting possibility arouse. Can you simply walk around Sony Studios without being bilked for admission?The one thing you will learn on this tour is that they make money at Sony. At $35/head they made close to $1000 on our group after we bought ice cream etc.Ironically, the pretour video promoted MGM films much better than it did Sony/Columbia Pictures.Much of the Sony Studios are leased out to other film companies. This is actually like touring an event space for hire, one you can't really afford.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnBuenTipo
40,Enjoyable,"My husband and I really enjoyed this tour. Our tour guide, Dave, was very friendly and answered many questions people had. He offered some neat little tidbits about celebrities who have been in certain areas throughout the different parts of the studio so it was interesting to hear some of his insider stories. We got to go on the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune sets which was great because my husband is a huge Jeopardy fan. We also learned some interesting things about what goes into making movies, such as sound effects and props, etc. that will really change how we watch our next movie. This tour shows you the cars used in Black Beauty and Ghostbusters. You get your picture taken in the beginning and then they give you a free copy of it at the end which was nice. Overall, we enjoyed the day. We wish we could have seen an actual movie set, but we did not. We would still recommend this to anyone who loves movies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LB_UCF2010
50,"""We are so glad we picked the Sony Tour!""","This tour was fantastic. It was a 2 hour walking tour through the Sony studio complexes. Our tour guide, Tony, was very informative and professional. He kept the group engaged and was able to answer any question. We saw several stage sets and Tony shared plenty of inside secrets about movie and TV making. It has really made us appreciate the work that happens behind the scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Susie
50,Cool history,"My husband and I love movies, so this was really cool to see some history. It's amazing to learn how the movies are made and what exactly goes on behind the scenes. We really enjoyed it, had a great and knowledgable tour guide. We were there just before the 4th of July so there were no stars around, but very enjoyable. I would say to try to go in a season that they're actually filming so you have the chance of seeing some celebs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErinD_11
50,Wonders of Sony,"Important to reach 30 minutes prior to tour time, if not you will miss the video presentation which is the first highlight of the tour. Also given an opportunity to have your photo taken and will be given to you at the end of the tour. Remember to bring along government ID, required at check-in. Reserve as early as possible! Really fun 2hour tour, was given the opportunity to view the Wheel of Fortune set-up..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluvhunni
40,"Enjoyable tour with very knowledgeable guide, Patrick","In LA with a big group for a wedding, so we were able to get a private group tour. Patrick, our guide, showed us all around and for a group of Midwesterners it was fascinating to hear the secrets behind the movies we watch. We had a beautiful day for the tour and we were able to see the Jeopardy set, as well as a new TV series set, the Ghostbuster car,& locations for various street scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryo7
50,Nice Informative Tour,"The tour was reasonably priced and informative. Tour members got free valet parking and a free photograph at the end. Great deal. I do understand their reasons for not allowing pictures in certain areas and that you could not go into certain areas. I have toured a couple of other studios and it is nice to get the re-curring bits of information such as the lights getting VERY HOT. Working in the building industry makes me appreciate this sort of information and am sure others working in the industry will appreciate that as well. We even got to see the set of Jeapordy.At the end of the tour, we were able to go to a gift shop or buy a frozen yogurt in the yogurt shop on the grounds which was reasonably priced as you bought it by the ounce and could put your favourite toppings on.Would recommend this tour. Be sure to call ahead and reserve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earnhardtcurt
30,"Sony Pictures Studio Tour - Okay, but not worth the time & cost","Our family of four went on the Sony Pictures Studio Walking Tour in early April 2012. While some interesting points about movie history are made, I would not recommend it. We were taken to see the empty stages of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy . . . and I do mean empty, the sets were off site, so there really was nothing to see. There just wasn't much substance to the tour. A couple of years back we did the Warner Studios tour, which was much better. I would recommend that one if you are considering a studio tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1772
50,Great studio tour!,"I highly recommend the Sony studio tour. We had Patrick as our guide and he was extremely knowledgeable and had the perfect amount of energy. The tour is completely a walking tour and you visit sound editing areas and game show stages. Our family liked this aspect and also how informative the tour was. As an extra bonus, Adam Sandler, who is often on the lot, drove by our group and spoke a few words to us! If you are up for walking and like the technical aspects of moviemaking, take this tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texastraveler1965
50,READY FOR YOUR CLOSE UP?,"Recently 30 of us went on a back lot stio tour at SOny Studios in Culver City. The guides broke us into 2 smaller groups of 15 which was nice that they made it easier to hear our guide and to see things. For me, I grew up in the industry so it was familiar, but my friends were in awe of how it all came together. We got to pose with famous movie cars like the Ghost Buster mobile. We met Adam Sandler as he came out of looping for the Oscar show. Then we sat in the audience for Wheel of Fortune. It was a fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
20,"Not worth the trip, the time or the money!","Honestly, it was pretty boring. We were told we were going to see the set for Wheel of Fortune. Well, we did but the set was dark and everything was covered up. We were taken into the room where sound effects were made (poor) but we did visit the set of ""Breaking In"" (much better). All in all, not worth the time it took to drive there from Anaheim (45 minutes), the time we spent on the tour and certainly not the $66.00 (2 tickets) for the tour itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerfromPhilly
30,"Not a bad tour, its just lagging behind the others . . .","Tour was well run with a good guide, I even saw a celeb which I hadn't in any other tour. Its just lacking the something special that the other tours seem to have. It just doesn't feel Hollywood enough. We were also told not to take photos - this is no good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJno41
50,Sony studios behind the scenes,"I loved this tour.It's a walking tour, small group inside Sony Studios. The tour guide Will was really chatty and showed his passion for film making.I thought it much different than the Paramount and Warner Bros.The tour guide showed us the place where that Oscar's are; where the stars sit before talking to the president about asking investment for a movie and what's the process of making a movie. You get to go to foley's studio, see some of the stages used in TV and movies and my favorite part ... get into the Barbra Streisand room on the sound studio. It was really emotional be in the room where this big bang singers recorded their music live with an orchestra - it's one of the most modern / well equipped studio in the world. If you're music fan like me - you'll be in heaven.My tour started at 5pm and I left around 10 pm. Was a fantastic day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragdias
40,A Small slice of History,"Sony owns the remains of the MGM Studios. MGM was sliced and diced by several owners, so the backlot is almost entirely gone. Sony has built some city street scenes on the streets between the sound stages. You go through a couple of sets - including some historic game shows. You see all the acadamy awards the studio has won. The tour starts in the large administration building across the street. Parking is free. Good shops in that building and the studio. Not a ""major"" attraction - but interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGMTraveler
50,Everyone is a Star,The 2-hour walking tour was great and reasonably priced. Our guide was knowledgable and able to answer all questions. This is worth it for an insight to a movie and TV studio.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapandus
50,Brilliant.,"My brother called Sony to book the tour and it turns out they gave us a 50% discount because he was polite. Off to a great start.Our group was very small, only the two of us and one other lady. Our guide Tony from Sony was equipped with extensive knowledge and experience and was hilarious to boot.Because the group was so small Tony could take us places tours normally can't go. We checked out the stage being used for the latest Judd Apatow movie to shoot, the Jeopardy set, the Rules of Engagement stage and several other stages steeped in history since their turn as MGM stages (wanna see the stages where The Wizard of Oz was shot?). The tour instills you with a sense of a modern working studio, but also of the incredible history of the lot. Also we went to the shop where the backdrops are hand painted to witness an amazing art form which has gone virtually unchanged for decades, the unique and fun Foley stage and the historic scoring stage where some of the most iconic film scores in history were recorded.Ever accommodating, I asked to see the original Ecto-1 car from the first (and beginning of the second) Ghostbusters and Tony said it was no problem. I snapped many a picture with her.This is turning into a novel because I so enjoyed the tour. I've done the Universal tram and VIP tours many times, and also Warner Bros. and Paramount. Sony - to my complete surprise - was the most enjoyable out of the lot. Truly the best kept secret in town.Sony is not a theme park, so you everything you see is a real, working studio. Sure you can get the VIP tour at Universal but that'll set you back around $300. Take the Sony tour for a personal and interesting experience, without the cattle herding of Universal.Also, check out the great array of original props and costumes in the lobby of the Sony Pictures Plaza building where the tour departs, there's some great stuff!-Luke",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumokan
30,No Hollywood Excitement.,"Our family has visited the Warner Brothers and Universal Studios tours on previous vacations, so we decided to gived this one a try. After visiting the other two tours first, I would just call this tour boring. It was not a bad tour, but it was nothing exciting. You arrive at the tour, you watch a short video then they take your picture to give you at the end of the tour. You then proceed across the street where the guide gives you a little history on Sony Pictures. You proceed through the fake building area, visit the music recording room, backdrop storage room, an unused set and the Wheel of Fortune set. I'm sure what area the guide can show you will vary depending what is in use for the day. There is some other additional information sprinkled throughout the walking tour. The grounds are neat and clean, but the lot seemed a little empty. There was no thinking throughout this tour that you would see any actors, but it could also be because we visited in the summer. You end the tour at their gift shop, which actually isn't much of a gift shop, but a place to grap a drink. The tour was then lead back to the starting point to retrive your picture. This tour was okay, but I would recommend taking the other tours first. The Warner Brothers tour is similar to this tour, where the Universal Studios tour is included in the cost of admission to their theme park, thus very expensive. For the money this is an okay tour. Low key, if that is what your looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margie123789
30,"Not a bad tour, although not one of the best ones.......","Tour is two hours long you pretty much just look at the outside of a series of buildings go in the jeopardy set, walk past Adam sandler's office, go to the gift shop and then leave.We saw some filming and we did see a star or two but that in no way affects my review or rating. You shouldn't go on any of these tours expecting to see somebody.Tour guide Tony was pleasant and extremely friendly, Although the biggest downfall of this tour was unbelievably there was NO PHOTOS ALLOWED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorna2011
20,I wish I would have taken a different studio tour,I took this tour because it was recommended to me by the people that I was staying with. I wish I would have taken another tour. There wasn't much to see but buildings and the Jepordy set. I didn't realize how close all of the other studios were to the rest of the Hollywood attractions. I should have driven a little bit further for something better. I do not recommend this tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowergirl3785
20,In a word: Awful...,"I am writing this review while still on vacation, and took the tour today...so it's fresh in my mind.The tour is exactly how many have already described it; no frills and pointing to many buildings. I went to Warner Brothers tour yesterday, and there is no comparison. Warner Brothers was excellent!!! One main point I want to mention: not only is it a walking tour, but at one point we climbed several flights of stairs to see where the backdrop of films are made. No warning...and several people were out of breath by the time we reached the top. I was surprised that there were no accommodations for someone who may need assistance.. It really isn't a good tour... Plus it's a distance from the other LA attractions... In my opinion, not worth the drive, time or money... Whether your a movie buff or just curious to see a movie studio tour...trust me, just go to Warner Brothers... You'll be glad you did, and won't have regrets...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tita1965
40,Worth the price,"Considering this tour is cheaper than the other tours in CA, this one is worth what you pay! Excellent and knowledgeable tour guide! Interesting behind the scenes info given on the tour as well! Would have liked to see more action if possible but I went on a holiday weekend so the studio was pretty calm. Would recommend to others! Nice, long, informative yet fun tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cwsbabe42
20,This Attraction Should Be Called The Adam Sandler At Sony Tour,"My wife and I took this tour last week. The interpretation of the grounds and studio history provided were disappointing. A tour of this type requires great storytelling by an engaging and passionate guide. We visited a very large studio building, a very tall studio building, an acoustically superb recording studio (no technical explanation could be provided) and saw the fence that surrounds Adam Sandler's private basketball court. Prior to that Mr. Sandler's customized tour cart was on view. We also walked by the superstar's office. All around us were historic buildings, offices and production centers that were once the work places of iconic and legendary Hollywood actors and artisans -- but you are mostly on your own to understand and absorb their significance. The tour highlight is the array of Best Picture Oscars on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrazyABoutOpera
50,"Informative, interesting, a real working studio","If you just want a studio tour without all the hype (Universal Studios), this is the tour for you. Walk through real sound stages, see lots of memorabilia. Takes only a couple of hours, a good excursion for visiting relatives from Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LALadyCC
10,The Worst Tour Ever,"I was so disapointed in the Sony tour. All I got to see was the outsides of forty concrete buildings all painted the same ugly muave color and windowless. We were told that this is where such and such a movie was filmed. Who cares if you only get to see the outside of the building. There wasn't one film set or any productions going on. We were shown the insides of two sound stages that were just empty warehouses. The Jeopordy set was completely covered in canvas so that was a waste. Wheel of Fortune wasn't available to see. They told us that there were free Tshirts but all they had were medium Spider Man ones (not my size or style). They ended the tour by making us wait ten minutes so people could purchase Sony products from their store. I just wanted to go home. I drove an hour each way and didn't see one camera, microphone, set, director or actor. I was so mad that I couldn't sleep that night - I wasted a vacation day for nothing. The next day I called and complained and offered a number of suggestions on how to improve their tour such as having a dedicated building with permanant sets and hire an actor who will work cheap so that we can meet and have photos taken with a celebrity (like Danny from the Partridge Family or some other child actor from those days). Also have a tram bring people around instead of walking. Our tour was all senior citizens and one was using a walker which held up the entire group. I also suggested having an interactive Jeporady show using the people in the tour and taping that - giving each person a chance to play for a few minutes on the actual set. They have to compete with Universal Studios and the answer I was given is that there is no space for them to have a permanent location and that the studio is not going to change anything. DON'T GO! It's a waste of 33 dollars and I asked for my money back which they were willing to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rprimus
50,It all depends on the day and the guide,Uv read all the reviews below and they ALL tell the truth.it is a movie buffs tours they dnt hav the yellow brick road but I got to stand on the trapdoor the wicked witch jumped up through I did get to meet Adam sandler and bill duke and for 33 dollars it was well worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramsesniblick
50,"A tour for serious movie buffs, rather than light entertainment- consider which studio tours you take!","Prior to writing this review:1. I have read the favorable and critical reviews of this tour; and2. I have taken this tour, as well as the Paramount tour, the Universal tour and the Warner Brothers (5 hour VIP) tour.This is a good tour of a fascinating studio, and encompasses the history of the MGM studios and Columbia Pictures, as well as the present day Sony movie and television operations.This tour is a ""mid range"" tour, in these senses:1. It is at the lower price range, with Paramount, and the standard Warner tour. The Universal tour includes a visit to their theme park. The VIP Warner tour is much more expensive;2. It's at the lower end of the time commitment- 2 hours- similar to Paramount and the Warner standard tour;3. It's a serious movie studio tour, where you walk through sets, visit backlots, go into sound stages and have a knowledgable guide who tells you about the movie making process;4. You visit historical locations in the studio. I stood on the spot where Judy Garland recorded ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" and walked over the stage where Fred Astaire danced. Sony own the old MGM studio facilities, and the buildings where the classic MGM movies were made still stand today and continue to be used;5. There's a display of memorabilia and costumes in the foyer of Sony's headquarters building; and6. It's a working television production facility.Here's my recommendations:If you love movies, this is a good tour. If you do this tour, you'll also want to do the other studio tours as well- each is different, and each gives you something of the respective studios.If you want to do a casual light tour, with maximal general entertainment value (especially with children), go to Universal, and enjoy the theme park as well.If you have a passing interest in movies, do one of Sony, Paramount or Warner. Each tour is different, and what you see will depend on what's happening in the studio on the day of your visit. However, each tour will give you a good introduction to the industry.Tips:1. Organise your visit so you can have lunch in their reasonably priced ""Wolfgang Puck"" commissary- situated in their headquarters building, and open to tour participants.2. The tour includes valet parking in the basement of the headquarters building- very convenient!,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adelaidiantraveller
50,Interesting and Informative 2 Hour Walking Tour,"My husband and I had taken the Warner Brothers Tour the day before and there is no comparison. Sony was less expensive and much better. Our tour guide, Patrick Finan, was VERY informative and knowledgable and most importantly, kept our interest for 2 hours! We saw the actual Oscar statutes the studio had won and learned the history of ""Oscar"", visited the Foley studio where all the sound effects are made, saw several new sets in the making, saw the set where the movie ""Burlesque"" was filmed, toured the set of Jeopardy and even though they were not taping when we were there, Patrick told us interesting and entertaining facts about the show. In the building where the tour begins/ends, there are several displays with actual props from famous movies to look at prior to going on the tour. Would definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobLindaF
50,Loved the Sony Tour!,"Loved the MGM history mixed with current Sony Studio happenings. It was an engaging two-hour experience strolling through a working lot... behind the scenes!For any MGM movie buff, the tour is a must. The tour guide filled the two hours with all sorts of MGM stories and anecdotes. We stepped into stages where classics filmed, including the Wizard of Oz!We saw real Oscars in the beautiful Irving Thalberg Building, headquarters for the studio, which also doubled as Peter Parker's high school in Spider-Man.And we also enjoyed seeing current sets for Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune and Rules of Engagement -- and an Adam Sandler movie set for an upcoming movie called ""Jack and Jill.""Definitely worth the price of admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soldier_Gurl
10,"There's no ""Wizard of Oz here!""","I moved here a year ago and FINALLY made time to go to Sony Picture Studios. I am a HUGE ""Wizard of Oz"" fan and couldn't wait to get a glimpse of the iconic stage where the movie took place.I read these reviews and have to say...they must be biased. The people reviewing this tour must either work for the company or be paid to review. They lied......I paid $66 dollars to experience this house of history and would rather have bought a pair of shoes!!!!First, you could only take pictures of a lame area called ""Main Street"". After that, NO PICTURES ALLOWED. I honestly don't know why. You only got to see brick or stucco buildings the whole time.The websites ""embellishes"" on the classic Wizard of Oz, but all you get to see is the number Studio 15 where it was filmed in 1936. You don't even get to walk in and feel captivated!!! Ugh! Just stare at a building with a number and NO picture.The tour guide lets u stop at a souvenir store at the end (Surely part of a marketing and tour business plan) to purchase items. After being disappointed, how can you help it! Of course, I didn't.Anyways, just go to Beverly Hills for a free tour. So much more fun and you will most definitely see where Pretty Woman was taped and spy some celebs!!!! Oh, and thanks for the free ""superimposed"" picture...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kissysusan
20,Very Disappointing,"I visited Sony and took the tour on August 26, 2010 with my family and felt the tour was disappointing. It starts off well with a short movie giving the history of the studio and movies made there....the highlight of the tour. From that point forward there was little of substance; a lot of walking looking at the exterior of buildings, a lot of talk of who may be at the studio, a lot of nothing! We spent close to three hundred dollars for tickets for the 8 of us and left feeling we had been ripped off. We were very disappointed and will not suggest this tourist trap to our friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmccann1958
50,Nice informative tour,"Our tour guide Patrick took us into a nice journey around the gigantic stages that compose the sony pictures lot. We got to see the scoring lot, where all pixar movies are scored (among many many more), We saw some stages where they were working on set building, we went to the jeopardy set and the rules of engagement set and an outdoor backlot (among other things). All these places were well explained by our guide who really managed to keep our attention during the two hour that the tour lasted. Nice tour if you want to know more about film history and you enjoy all the production side of this industry (BTW, don't hesitate asking the guides any question, they'll gladly answer you).I would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilauzirika
50,Glad I went,"I was trying to decide between Sony and Paramount. I had done Paramount about 15 years ago and really picked Sony because it was closer to my hotel. I was glad I did. I had read a few of the reviews before I went and was excited to find that Tony was my tour guide as well. He is quite popular on here...and for good reason. He was very personable and involved almost each of us in the tour at some point. We were able to go into the Jeopardy studio, which wasn't taping, but it was neat. We didn't see anyone famous, although we did see Matthew Perry's car in his reserved spot as well as some ""background actors"" waiting to go on the set for Justin Timberlake's ""Friends with Benefits"" movie. My favorite part was going inside a Foley stage. That is where they do the sound effects for movies. I had no idea. I really learned a lot about how movies are made. I would definitely recommend this tour. $33 was well spent. Yes, I got a laminated badge as well as a nice photo taken against a green screen, which eventually showed up as the Wheel of Fortune set. I did not go back to the tour office for ""freebies,"" but Tony invited us to. You won't be disappointed if you take this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connienobles
50,Best Studio Tour in LA !!!!!!,"We visited Sony for the tour on 26th May 2010 and out of the 3 (4 if you include the Universal Back Lot Tour ) Sony was by far the best.Our guide ""Tony"" was brilliant,he had a real passion for the studio and his enthusiasm really rubbed off on our tour group.Right from the start it felt like a little community you were spending a few hours with.Everyone was so friendly and said hello all the time You never felt like a paying guest.We got onto the Jeopardy set and Tony was great at showing us how the game worked as most of the group were from europe and never saw the show before.We also got to see the ""Foley Artist"" studio,really cool to see.We also got to see the music studio where they record the music for tons of films again this was brilliant to see.As hard as Tony tried for us we unfortunately did not see any stars but that is the luck of the draw with any studio tour.Even without any star spotting you will come away from this tour with a sping in your step and a hugh smile on your face.We also got FREE!!! T shirts,A brilliant photo taken at the start of the tour FREE!!!! and the laminated VIP ID cards we had to wear FREE!!! and the guide on this tour did not REMIND us to tip the guide (like most tours now seem to in LA) but TONY definetly deservered a tip for the brilliant tour he gave.If you only do one tour in LA do this one.Lisa, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freakycat
40,Totally worth it,"The walking tour was a blast. We went on a dark day for the studio, and were able to explore two different pilot sets and a game show set. It was interesting to hear the history and see where a show tapes. It gives a different perspective when watching a show on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ded2525
30,"Just ""ok"" ...not really what i expected","The tour was okay. There were some interesting things to see. We didn't see any stars/celebrities. The tour description also states you will see the ""yellow brick road"". We did NOT see that. We saw the sets for Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. The rest was just basically visiting ""sets"" and sound stages that had been built to film, the filming was done and they were tearing them down. Not sure I would reccomend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julz123
30,Definitely Take The Tour,"I preface the above title because of the below reviews. We went on September 5th and while very informative, our tour guide ""Chet"" seem distracted and unsure where to take us. We ended up walking around the lot and got to sit in the empty Jeopardy set, and see where old vintage backdrops were painted (JCBackings). That was it.We got an overview of what each studio was doing, but we never got to go into anything, and Chet seemed distracted and not on his game as far as planning ahead of time.The lobby of the studio is very impressive, and everyone was very nice. Chet was good on knowledge and seemed to know everyone on the lot. Just wish we could have gotten more involved and seen how sets are designed, etc...Take my review as the exception and definitely visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMichaelLarson
50,Great Tour,Wonderful tour - tour guide Tony was great!fabulous value for money at $28 per tourwalking tour made the tour much more personal and up closeTry going during the week vs the weekend as this is when productions are being filmed and you have greater chance of seeing actors,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarigoldToronto
50,Best tour ever!!!!,"This was the best tour ever, our tour guide was Tony and he made the experience that much better!!! We ran into a couple stars and were able to tour some sitcom sets. I definately recommend this tour to anyone visiting the area. Our tour guide was chock full of hollywood info, there was never a dull moment.I'm sure all the tour guides are wonderful but we just happened to get Tony and we enjoyed his tour very much.Love from Chicago",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/u4real74
50,Don't Miss This One,"Everything about this was great! Parking was easy, main lobby was grand; array of costumes in various glass enclosures, gift shop, restaurant and a small office to buy our tour ticket. Your picture is taken after you buy your tour ticket which you can purchase after the tour and since my cousin and I do not like to carry around a camera we liked having a picture of us together. The tour is well worth it, very interesting and our guide was very knowledgeable. The only disappointment was that many shows and productions were on (July) vacation, so there wasn‚Äôt the normal activity. Tour ending back at the main lobby, were we then had lunch. The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. I would highly recommend a visit and hope to do a tour again myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/u12know
40,Watched a taping of Jeopardy,We didn't take a tour of this studio. But we did get to watch two tapings of Jeopardy. My kids loved it. Everyone was really nice and we all had an excellent time. I recommend going online and trying to get tickets to a taping of a show while you are visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMH1416
50,Don't miss this tour!,"I've been on almost all the studio tours in the LA area and this has been my favorite, so far. You start off in a beautiful lobby of the famous Sony Pictures Plaza building. There's water and a little cafe in case you're hungry or thirsty. The best part is that there are displays all around the lobby with props and costumes from all sorts of Sony films that you can take pictures of/with. The workers are very nice and will take a picture of your whole party if you need it.The actual tour was great! I liked the fact that we walked everywhere instead of riding on a golf cart, because it gives you more time to look around and ask questions. The Sony lot is a very active lot and you are guaranteed to see working productions on your tour. Our guides pointed out all sorts of actors, directors, stunt people, writers, and other important people. They were all kind enough to wave and give us a friendly greeting too. Sometimes even the really famous actors will say ""hi"" to the group. Some of the sets we saw were spectacular and even the empty sound stages were amazing.Unlike most of the other tours I've been on, this one was VERY educational. It wasn't just ""Here's this building..."" ""Here's where they did this movie..."" Our guides actually pointed out how things worked and what the purpose of all the elements of a sound stage were. We learned about everything that goes into creating and filming a TV series - all the unglamorous, hard-work kind of things that you normally don't hear about. It was SO interesting and informative! I left with a better understanding and appreciation for the business. Of course it was still cool to see where certain things were filmed and which buildings were transformed for certain productions.I can't say enough about how amazing our tour guides were. They made sure that everyone was involved and having fun, even when our group had people from all over the world that didn't speak English as well. They kept things interactive and by the end of the tour they new all our names. They were eager to answer questions, help with anything you didn't understand, and take pictures at the end of the tour. In my case, they actually went the extra mile and helped me look up directions on the tour office's computer to a restaurant nearby that I needed to find.Oh, and another perk is that you get free stuff at the end of the tour! Not only do you get to keep your awesome badge, but they gave us movie posters, toys, etc.I had a great time and highly recommend this tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeganofTroy
40,A great look at a real working studio with lots of history!,"Just wanted to let people know that we have a secret gem of a tour within driving distance. I'm talking about the Sony Studios tour. Our guide was able to bridge the history of the location (used to be an MGM lot) with the modern day workings of a studio which included film and television.We've been there twice in the past, and this time was even better because we lucked out and got there when Will Smith was there rehearsing for a new movie. Even though we had different guides on each visit, they all taught us something new.We couldn't see filming in buildings (because we couldn't interrupt) but they were doing a scene from the television show Entourage, (my son's favorite) on the main street and we watched them do that several times.( Our guide told us that a lot of different shows film occassional scenes on the lot . )It was interesting and my son got to see the lead actor up close. We got to take pictures on the main street when they were done filming.My wife and I like the older stuff, and even though the real yellow brick road is gone, the building where it was is there and we got to see what was currently in it, which was a stunt set for the Will Smith movie, not to mention my favorite, Jeopardy!If you like history and how the studio thing really works, this tour will teach you a lot.If my son gets into school up there, we will be visiting again because it's always different and they make it fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chippy525
