Was very lucky to get affordable tickets near the Lakers tunnel. If a NBA game isn’t on your bucket list, I’d recommend adding it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scar_boyy
10,TERRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE,"TERRRIBLE costumer service. The people who are supposed to direct you to your seats know NOTHING and are totally unhelpful, the managers or the people in charge of the events (for my case Calibash 2020) were rude, even to their own workers. When I called to complain and at the end of the day they ignored me and kept hanging up on me and it took me almost a week to talk to the supervisor. At the end of the day, they told me that they could not do anything about because (since me and my friends lost our tickets on our 3rd move of seats due to the fact that their staff do not know the directory of the venue) they had no prove that we actual purchase the tickets. Instead they sat us very far from where we were supposed to be seated and took a long time to just tell me that there was nothing they could do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicolethescholar26
40,Nice place to catch a hockey game,"Up to date and very nice arena. We went to the hockey game and it was a great time. The seats were very comfortable. It was difficult to find out section, as there was a specific entrance/escalator we needed to take, but it was very nice and clean. It really was a great place to watch a game, even though our team lost.Staples Center is located at LA Live, a mini downtown of sorts.

30,"Could be awesome, but...","Went here to watch an NBA game with 3 friends. We found it nearly impossible to even buy tickets to get in. Not sure if it had something to do with the Kobe memorial but it was so disorganised and horrible that we just about gave up. The centre itself looks nice and is well maintained with great sound and lighting. Confusing on how to get to the top levels though, seats were very cramped and drink/food prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!

50,Amazing venue and fantastic staff,"During a visit to LA in the regular season, a trip to see an NBA game was a must. We were really fortunate that the Lakers were home during the week we were there, so booked 4 seats for our family. We knew we would be high, but did not really appreciate the steepness of the rake of the top tier seats. Seats are pricey so we booked the row offered by the website.When we arrived and sat in our seats, some of the family really felt very uneasy sat at the top of the seats. I went to customer services and asked if there was any way they could assist and they were really accommodating and managed to re-seat two of us to lower seats. This was all that was needed and we had an amazing evening watching the game. Unfortunately the Lakers lost that night but it was still a great evening.Great thanks to the staff who helped with the seat changes, it really made the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389dereko

We walked a bit around LA Live both before and after the game. There's quite a lot there. Since it was November, the ice skating rink was set up. I'm from New York, and it was kind of a blend of Rockefeller Center (with the ice skating rink and Christmas decorations) and Time Square with all of the lights.

Game at Staples Center are something else! Production far exceeds what I have seen in Canadian arenas, but being LA you would expect this. Spacious concourses with great food and beverage options throughout. Cheaper prices than Honda Center as well.

Adjacent “LA Live” always provides goodEntertainment, food and people-watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelk265
40,An LA Experience,We came to LA for my birthday and a Lakers game was on out to-do list. We stayed in West Hollywood and were running late but Waze took us a very bizarre but traffic free route... so it was easy getting there. Parking was simple because we went in a lot.We had excellent seats which made it exciting... we were close enough to see Jack Nicolson and Larry David. The most interesting part was how cool the fans were. I’m from Philly and we are yelling and chanting from start to finish and trying to disrupt the opposing team’s free throw shots even if we’re blowing the other team away. But this was a back and forth 2 point game with the Kings and the fans seemed to just chit chat with each other. It was funny because they didn’t start making a little noise until the last few minutes of the game.It was so LA 😎,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215MJ
50,Great Arena,"Came here for a Saturday hockey game on the 300 level (last minute seats). Though in downtown, it was not that hard to get here (bar normal traffic).

It is nice that there are several restaurants nearby for pre and post games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Panglosian

This was the best sporting experience ever....wanted to go to every lakers match afterwards.Atmosphere was phenomenal staff were great. Security was present and I felt safe. Lakers won so was a bonus to the experience.We had seats far up from the ground but this did not effect our experience. Fans were amazing.I loved this experience. Thank you Lakers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/affbee
50,Lakeshow is back!,"Been Lakers fan all my life. Bout time they put a solid team together. Only disappointing thing about the venue is the ticket price to watch the games. Was at 100 level and the seats weren’t cheap. Through out the game ppl were sitting in other ppls seats. I thought I was going to get in a fight cuz someone said I was sitting in theirs, until they looked at their ticket and realized they were the ones wrong. Paid too much for my seat to not know where it is. Concession prices are a high grab too. $8 for chips with a little bit of nacho cheese on the side, $14 pints of beer. Overall it cost too DAYUM much for a date night and way too much to take a family. But is entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakerman83

50,It is a great start of the season,"Went there during the NBA preseason 2019, Lakers & Clippers.

Also, the sports bar across the road with several big screens was the right place for those who did not get the tickets. Great atmosphere, great game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOMINIQUEBEV
50,Exiting game and a tip for their bag policy,"We watched a Clippers preseason match. That was a wonderful time for us.Luckily we got seats in Row 1 of Lower Center with a very low price probably because it was a preseason match and we bought them very early. The experience near the court was really exciting. We got a close look at Clippers players on the seats as well as the thrilling game.By the way, Row 1 of Lower Center doesn't mean the first row. There are three rows in the court side area. The first row is for players and staff. The second and third are for fans. Of course, they are very expensive.Let me share a note with you about their bag restriction.They have their own bag restriction policy. You can't get into the center with your backpack.So we booked a bag drop-off service near it. However, when we get there, to my surprise, they said they couldn't have my bag because of their overbooking.Then, we went to the center with a lost face, and asked staff whether they have any solutions. They had it! If you get a X-ray check, you can enter it with your backpack. As far as I know, they don't have any guides about that. So please talk to staff in front of the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koki1015sv
50,Mint condition,"This 20 year old arena is still today in mint condition. Everything worked, including easy parking with 20$ fee. Great views all around the arena. We watched a hockey game from premier seats just in line with the center line - hard to imagine better seats. Fast and friendly service even during hectic breaks. Really good sound system. Good crowd and atmosphere. No massive lines to restrooms. Simply a great arena!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
50,Fantastic sports venue,"My Husband and I visited here whilst on vacation to see both the Kings and Clippers. Arena is huge, ample parking lots near to venue, prices are reasonable (for arena's).

40,Went for basketball,Stadium is huge! Easy to get to by metro system -bus or train. Simple and fast entry system... can be quite difficult to find seating block. The 200's are on the same level as all the 100's...its only the 300's that are up the escalators. Typically put off of going to the Downtowns of cities as haven't had great experiences however downtown LA is built up quite well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aim1994
20,Expensive with a lot of bad seats,"Before going to Staples to see a concert you have to purchase through AXS, a horrid ticket agency that will treat you terribly. So, now you have your tickets and you get to go through bad traffic to get to Downtown LA.Once there, you will pay between $30 and $50 just to park. They make a lot of money that way. Now that you have parked and walked and walked to get to the venue, if you want any snacks or anything, I hope you brought a lot of money. Everything is over priced and none of it is good.You will then get to your expensive seats only to find that the first 10 rows are great and the rest of the place has bad views.Good luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marycJ5885HH

We were lucky to buy tickets right at the spot. We came to the Center by a walk as we lived just couple blocks from the Center. On our way we liked LA live vcity vibes. Entrance and security check were fast. We tried overpriced snack ( nachos). We bought LA cap in the souvenir shop, to have some memories at home. What we really enjoyed was pre game light show including programme at the cube. Although seated nearly under the roof, we had good visibility. The match we OK, we were mainly focused on the 2 Czech players Voracek and Gudas. We also appreciated friendly atmosphere among fans of both teams.

50,Kings Swept Up The Toronto Maple Leafs!,"Came here to watch the LA Kings sweep up the Toronto Maple Leafs back in January 2015 and it was amazing!Thought the score was 0-2 only, there was lots of entertainment! The band ""Who's Your Daddy"" performed both anthems and they sang em exceptionally well as a quartet.Also found the Kings mascot to be quite hilarious as we was trolling Maple Leafs fans! They showed him on the jumbo tron ""sweeping up leaves"".Overall it was a great experience and I definitely will be returning here in the future for more games!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983stevey

50,Every bit as amazing as we hoped! 10/10,"American spectator sport at its very best! I cannot tell you how much fun we had at a Lakers Game here, everything was great. The atmosphere, the safety, the food options, the fans, the buzz, great audience behaviour and fan participation - brilliant. The only thing we underestimated was the time to get through the security queue into the venue; it was long but they were thorough, polite and everyone did the right thing - it took probably 25mins. This was out first visit to the Staples Centre, we walked there and came through the very hip LA Live for a cheap pizza dinner prior to entry into the game. The game was electric; the big screen even from our cheap seats was epic, the game caller, sound system- the buzz was awesome! The Lakers were slick and a thrill to watch. The place was packed but I never felt unsafe - everyone was respectful and polite despite the thousands of people there #cannotbebeatenforwow",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquiSydney
40,Overall Happy and felt safe,"Went to a concert on a Saturday night. Thought Staples, downtown it would be a nightmare getting in. Not at all. They have it figured out and we got in and out with a breeze. Staples is a great place for a show. The sound and aquatics are good.My wife worries about being in places that are not safe. This area is very safe and plenty of police in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JIMDAWG13

40,Big time sports meca.,"Coming from Oregon and really only having been to the Rose Quarter, the Staples Center and the surrounding area was quite a big step up. Plenty of parking, tons to see and do and just awe inspiring for us small town Oregonians. Would have given 5 stars, but the Lakers play here and as a Blazer fan it would be wrong of me not to fault it for that. In other news, the Blazers did beat the Clippers while we were there so that was a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmW1446UM

40,Part of L.A. history!,"Great place to experience as it's such a notable venue in L.A. Plenty of parking nearby, but the closer you get to the stadium, the more expensive parking. You can easily find a cheap, $10 spot a couple blocks down the road. The metro blue line also gets off quite near the place. Of course, expect to pay inflated prices inside the stadium as well! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessbefree
20,Concerts n Sport Events,"Parking for all events is really expensive. Each event is a different price. So be prepared. I park about 2 blocks away and very close to my freeway, $10. The Staples Center seats are very high up in the colonnade section, cheaper seats. Can be scary up there. I go there a lot but not happy with the place. Food is very expensive too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goshop58

40,Lakers vs Warriors,Too bad Lebron didn't play. Easy to get to stadium in downtown LA. McDonald's inside. Ate chicken tenders and fries from courtside ordering. Game was fun.

50,amazing arena,"We went to a Kings game vs Arizona. Game was ok, but this arena has an AWESOME light/effects show prior to the game, don't miss this part.

50,Nice.,"While visiting Los Angeles, I was able to get really cheap tickets to a hockey game. I always wanted to visit this well-known venue and thoroughly enjoyed while I was in there! While I wanted to tour the building without any event going on, unfortunately, Staples Center does not provider tours (like Dolby Theatre, etc. provide) but I did not mind the hockey game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orcadas

50,LA Lakers Game,"Last night my husband and I went to watch the LA Lakers v Washington Wizards. What a great venue and a brilliant game. We were literally sitting in the back row of the venue, but had still had a great view. The tickets were expensive, especially based on where we were sitting. Perhaps more leg room would have been great, when you are sitting for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_B_Perth

50,Enjoy LA Lakers!,"A nice place especially if you are Lakers fun. There are many other events that take place such as concerts. In September 2018, I visited ""Nokia Theater"" just across Staples center - guess who was performing! Zaiko Langa Langa - featuring the only and only ""Nyoka Longo"". It was awesome to see an African Band playing live. I love Staples Center and the vicinity - a walking distance to Downtown LA - another fabulous place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnkS1650AW

40,Great Sports Venue In L.A. Live Downtown!,Went to a Clippers game in the Staples Center and had a great time! Good seats even away from the court! Friendly helpful ushers! Entertaining half time. No long lines for food or drinks because they have so many stands open. Parked in a lot a few blocks away and walked there for a cheaper lot. Really close to public transportation. Near the J.W. Marriott Hotel. Really great place to bring the family! Alcohol is sold. Clippers won!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaw353

30,Kings Game,"OK, the only reason I'm writing this review, is because as a 55 year old man, they asked me for ID to buy a beer. Really!? So, I showed my drivers license (from Canada) and then she demanded a passport. Really!? Of course I don't carry it to a hockey game and was refused. No one else in my group was asked. I really ought to have complained (but didn't)... it was just so bizarre. A buddy bought for me. Other than that, there isn't a bad seat in the house, and the statues outside were really well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucySlater518
20,"Great Basketball, But Bot A Great Venue","On our trip to LA, we watched the Lakers take on the Pelicans and the ball was great, it was a treat to see both LeBron and Anthony Davis on the court, especially amid trade rumors over Davis and in a game that mattered to the Lakers. Entertaining basketball and truly fun to see the home team earn the win! The venue left much to be desired. No doubt, we didn’t splurge and bought tickets in one of the nose bleed sections, but everything was a bit of a struggle. The escalators were broken, they wouldn’t let people even walk up them, so an epic line built for an elevator. Concessions were a challenge - staff wasn’t well trained and struggled with credit card transactions. We got stuck in sluggish lines a few times. Seating was terrible. I’m sure I could use a diet, but have attended lots of games and these were tightest seats I’ve ever been to in all of professional sports. So, we found the atmosphere just a little inhospitable. I thought the challenging environment impacted fan spontaneity as it was difficult for fans to interact with one and other in such cramped quarters. There was little about the venue that was noteworthy, unique or special. We had much more fun taking in a college game at the super friendly, clean and comfortable Pauley Pavilion at UCLA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NHJimmy

50,Los Angeles Lakers!,"Enjoyed a first-time experience at Staples Center watching the Lakers win a good contest against the New Orleans Pelicans. Terrific venue for entertainment with the court visible from all angles. Loud, packed full of small eateries and Laker merchandise shops, Staples Center gave us a great taste of the entertainment basketball can offer. If you’re travelling by the metro system, the nearest stop to the venue is Pico.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09

30,Not a great deal to see.......,"STAPLES Centre is the home of the NBA Lakers and Clippers teams as well as the NHL Kings.

50,Experience of a Life Time,"Visiting from Australia this was one of the highlights of our trip as we had the opportunity to watch the Lakers v San Antonio Spurs. What an incredible night we had. The stadium is truly an experience: from our fabulous seats, the entertainment, the atmosphere, the freebies being handed out to create noise and of course the game itself was brilliant. The Lakers came away with a win in the dying moments of the game which made it even more exciting. Our kids even got on the Jumbotron so that made their night!The only thing that surprised us was in Sydney we can watch a NBL game for $19 a ticket but here it cost us $1265 for 4 tickets! Admittedly we could have bought tickets in the very back row for around $75 each but as this was a once in a lifetime experience we wanted to be close enough to feel part of the action. We were probably in the middle of Section 106 with a brilliant view. Expensive yes, worth it - definitely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9666QRkareng
50,Awesome stadium,One of the best stadiums I’ve been to. Went to watch the Clippers and the Lakers and throughly enjoyed both. Can’t really get s bad seat so don’t be upset if you have to sit up the back. Plenty of places to get food and drink as well as stock up on some merch. Even if you’re not the biggest sports fan you’ll still have a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowellyBear
50,First Time to watch Lakers,"Visiting from Australia, we had the opportunity to watch The Lakers vs The Clippers - What an amazing stadium and spetical. Entertainment and atmosphere through out the game was brilliant. Very professional and a real friendly sponsorship base where there was friendly fire within the crowd. Even after the game, there were these vendors selling hotdogs as the 25,000 strong crowd were leaving for a late night snack..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adadamico

40,City of Angels,STAPLES Center is huge. It is a beautiful stadium right in the heart of LA. Lots of restaurants with outdoor seating just outside the stadium and ice skating rink that looked pretty popular. The line for ice skating was wrapped all around the front of the Staples Center. I had to laugh because snow and ice are so common where I'm from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWarrenM
40,Nose bleed tickets,"Ok my friends got nose bleed tickets from work for the LA Clippers game, not the LA Lakers but the Clippers. It’s free so what the heck. Took the metro train to downtown LA. Don’t have to worry about parking etc. We are on a tight budget looking for a good time. A cup of beer $8-10 was expected. Hot dogs and pretzel , etc. We came for the show, not the food. We love rooting for our Los Angeles sport teams! Los Angeles is a city that takes pride in their teams! So we were really high in the stadium , I watched more of the television than the actual game. You can’t ask for much when it’s free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CambodiaTravelsGuide
30,Its all about the basketball,The stadium is a bit stale but the history begs a visit. Went to a Lakers game and it is very organised for entry and exit but not as historic as say a Yankee Stadium or Madison Square Garden in regards to memorabilia around the concourses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outalot307
40,"ok venue, get there early","We visited for the ice hockey. Queues outside the centre before the game were long and there seemed to be a bottleneck at each entry point where tickets were being checked manually. Inside there's a variety of fast food outlets offering basic food. Great views from mosts seats. Amazingly it takes only 2 hours to convert the stadium from hockey to basketball and vice-versa. The biggest disappointment though were the Kings, losing to the Senators after leading.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevoHughes1
50,Lebron has helped the LA downtown economy!,Attended the Lakers versus Bulls game last week. Staples Center was packed - but no Lebron due to injury.The quality of the game wasn't the best - as neither team played that well - but enjoyed the venue.Prices for tickets are cheaper when the Clippers play in the same arena - so Lebron has been good to the ticket sellers.Many drink options and food options to please anyone's taste.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmallTownBuckeye

50,Fun Times at a Clippers Game,We had such a great time at a Clippers Game. The Staples Center is great! We were in a PR section with decent views. We could order food from a server and have it brought to us. That was cool. There are much better seating but too much $ for us. The center was easy to navigate. We parked down the street for $15. Easy entry and pretty easy exit. Super close to Staples.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalr454
50,Super nice joint,Went to watch a clippers game. Went as aposing fans crowd was awesome to us. Staff was fantastic. Venue was really nice easy to access. Very awesome experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitchl501
50,Really a nice venue!,"The event I attended was a college basketball tournament sponsored by the Air Force Reserve. I had not ever been to Staples Center before and I really didn’t know what to expect. Now, it wasn’t a huge event and not extremely well attended save for the die-hard fans of each college in the tournament but from an operational standpoint, it was a wonderful visit. There were ushers to assist every step of the way, the food venue I chose to buy food (Spotlight Grill) at was fully staffed and the food was very tasty, and the food was good. I am sure when there is a concert or sporting event that packs the house, the staff is going full-tilt. I was not disappointed in the least. Well done!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
50,Go lakers!!,"Visited here twice, first time to watch the Kings at an ice Hockey match and then the LA Lakers Basketball team.

50,GO LAKERS!,"I have been lucky enough to visit the Staples Center for so many different reasons. Lakers games, Clippers Games, Kings Games, Music Concerts (Timberlake) and more! The venue is huge, clean and bumping sound. The women always dress nice here lol even just for a Lakers game which is funny but all apart of the benefits at Staples. Of course I wish the beers were cheaper but we can't have it all right? If you haven't been here yet for an event I highly recommend you get to a Lakers game quick!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captain_nomad

40,A Must in DTLA,"“Panem et circenses!” has for eternities been a backbone of civilized distraction from political and daily life struggles.Staples Center has exactly that function in DTLA! Embedded in the increasingly vibrant and attractive area to include the entire L.A. live district, it hosts all kinds of sports and entertainment venues. It does not even matter whether one is a die-hard fan or an accidental tourist: the energetic atmosphere in the stadium - that regardless of the fundamental dislikes of the antagonistic teams (e.g. LA Lakers vs NY Knicks on Jan 04, 2019) remains committed to a peaceful and enjoyable experience – is breathtaking. And the amazing thing is that it is great fun to be next to the floor but the suites and even the high/far away seats have their respective sweet aspects.Two negatives: (1) the seats are to short for a 6’4” person; and (2) while there are increasing food options outside the stadium in walking distance (e.g. Faith & Flower was great), inside they are still limited and better quality food would be highly desirable.(Originally posted by me on yelp)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMKaiser
50,Incredible show NBA - Lakers,"Really an incredible experience. You will be a few meters away from the players and living that atmosphere is great.When you buy the tickets you will want to save and buy the cheapest, but do not skimp, you will not regret, just buy where you like.Popcorn and soft drinks in staples glass are refill the times you want.106, 107, 115 and 116 this areas area cheap and with a very good view.I will return at least twice a year to Staples.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTY72PAX
40,Just an average arena,"I decided to check out an L.A. Clippers vs Phoenix Suns basketball game while i was in Los Angeles. Normally when i visit an arena for the first time i like to walk around the inside concourse to see what interesting things each arena has on display or to offer the fans attending, and surprisingly for an arena with 3 major sports teams this one was pretty lackluster for things of interest in the inside. As for the positives, this arena was quite clean and the seats had great viewing even in the upper level. To me the greatest highlights of this arena were on the outside where they had incredible sculptures in tribute to their past star L.A. Lakers and Kings players",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130

50,Adrenalin rush!,Not a big sports fan but came here as a group in a corporate box...

30,"From the cheap seats high in the rafters, you see a postage stamp","Tickets are expensive. Downtown Los Angeles is, at best, grim and grimy. Traffic, of course, is usually horrible. The venue itself is not one of the great sports palaces of the work or the United States. And if you get the cheapest tickets and you are high in the rafters, you see very little. Of course given most performances by the Lakers these days, that may not be such a bad thing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc

40,Huge Center,"We went to see Disney on Ice at the Staples Center. We parked about one to two blocks away from the Staples Center, and the parking was $20. Staples Center was enormous, and it was hard to find things. But, since there were ushers, it was pretty easy to find your seat. There were many concessions stands, but we went to Outtakes. We ordered the portobello-caprese sandwich, which was delicious and the Turkey Bacon Wrap, which was mostly just turkey and lettuce. We also wanted to get dippin dots or a snow cone, but we discovered that dippin dots was $12 and a snow cone in a cup was $15, so we just skipped the whole thing. I'm glad that I brought a jacket because it was freezing in there. Disney on Ice was a very entertaining show, and we hope to go back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloeCarnitas

40,Efficient,"I love the outside of Staples Center (LA Live). It’s light up with really neat flashing signs and news crews ... similar to a mini Time Square. But you feel safe packed in with all these rowdy people at night before and after a game. It’s a really fun atmosphere. The entry area is extremely efficient, possibly the best.... right up there with the AAC in Dallas. They scan you, scan your phone and you’re in. And unlike other arenas there’s no yelling. I LOVE THAT! Food was great. Everything was easy to understand, direction-wise. Some of the fans were completely drunk and disorderly and swearing. They put a damper on our whole rows experience. I was surprised that they continued to be served? Aside from that Staples Center is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjeatsworld

So much more than East Coast games. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cwhite8181
40,Lakers vs Bucks,"Visiting Staples and Lakers itself is the thing after watching NBA only on TV for more than two decades. Expensive ticket, food and beverage as expected, but you may skip all these and try those hit-and-run hotdog trolleys after the match. Traffic long after the match. It took me, as a non-driving tourist, some 20 minutes to catch a Lyft ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wongt626
40,Lakers House,Being a Basketball fan I made sure to go downtown LA just to visit the Staples Center even though we were in summer off season. I got to see the building of the stadium from outside and checked the players statutes (Karimk Magic...) outside especially Shaq hung up there in the sky. I also visited the official store hoping to get Lebron James new Jersey but unfortunately it wasn't released yet. I was pleased and took several photos.

50,Lakers preseason,"We purchased tickets to the Lakers vs Nuggets preseason game. We chose seats in the PR section and it gave us a close enough view of the players that we didn’t feel the need to watch the centre screen. The atmosphere was great, the place was clean and the chilli cheese fries were delicious. It was our first time at an NBA game and we both really enjoyed it. Spend a little more to sit in PR or sections starting with 2 or 1; it’s well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/331travelbug

50,Kids at NHL Game,"We took two young girls 11 & 6 to last week's Las Vegas Golden Knights vs L.A. Kings pre-season game. It was a wonderful experience benefitting from ease of finding the arena, friendly arena and team staff, and tasty food. The usher sat us in the wrong section and we only did the $30 parking at L.A. Live because our game tickets were free, but otherwise the night was a success. The highlight as always was the incredible, exciting, fast-moving sport of hockey that we got to watch. Arrive early to fist-bump the players during the pre-game warm-up!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain

30,Love and hate.,"Love the location: It's downtown at LA Live. Surrounded by many restaurants, lots of parking and plenty of security.Hate the location: It's downtown. Traffic getting there and leaving is horrible. Parking lots all charge too much.Love the venue: They have so many choices of entertainment. Lakers, Clippers, Kings and many concerts. All the top entertainers in the country hold concerts there. Sound system is pretty good.Hate the Venue: Ticket prices are outrageous. Trying to get good seats for a sporting event or concert are impossible unless your willing to pay high prices to a broker. The cost of food and drinks are just as high. The seats are too close together. Not much leg room for tall people. Be prepared to pay a lot for parking.Overall: Hate to go there and deal with traffic and high prices, but if you love to see the Lakers, Clippers, Kings and all the top entertainers, you have to go!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
40,Well Organised Venue,Went to a concert at the Staples Centre and the whole experience was great. A very easy place to reach with plenty of parking nearby. Lots of restaurants and bars around the centre too. Staff were very helpful and the large crowds moved quickly through the venue. All in all a well oiled machine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChateauChapeliere
50,Clippers,"I recommend getting there early as parking can be a challenge. This venue is clean, the staff is friendly, there are many choices for food. The atmosphere was perfect for a game. This was a family event and all 15 of us enjoyed ourselves. We discussed the next game we'd attend as we were leaving. Ages 8 - 63.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore547380
50,Best place for Concerts,"I have been to the Staple center from everything to Concerts to X-Games. This is truly the best place to see a concert. The parking is easy, the food is good & the sound quality is amazing. I average 3 concerts or more a year at this location. I started taking my child there was they where 5 & it was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natural1sumr
40,IT is a kind of magic,"Because LAL stadium is more than a NBA place, is part of the history of this big city and California itself. It`s also magic because it was the house of Magic Johnson; or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Byron Scott, Orlando Woolridge, Worthy, ... and more and more. If you are in LA, do not forget visiting this legend place and take outdoors photos with these monsters. Interesting area also for dinner or have a drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josegV3393SU
20,They Always Have a Way of Making You Never Want to Return,"As I have said in a previous review, we go to Staples many times during the year. I have never had a good experience there. Not that we don't love the concerts etc., I am talking about the venue. It is just awful in so many ways.They have about 20 parking spaces in the front. None of them are for handicapped parking, so all those with a disability are sent sometimes more than a block away in structures. That might be doable in a wheel chair, but if you have a walking issue, that is just too bad. Figure it out, on your own, or stay home.This time we went to Monster Jam, which my grandson loved. What he did not love was the awful food, the inability to get to a restroom that does not have a line that stretches for quite a while and the total indifference of the employees there.Parking is 30$ (this time--it changes) and there is next to no security watching your vehicle.We will be back because sometimes we have no choice, but it could be great, but they don't care.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

50,Best place to see a show in SoCal,Staples Center is a world class venue flanked by LA Live. We’ve seen everything from Lakers games to a P!nk concert to Momster Jam here. The venue is state of the art but the location makes it feel like a true get away. We take the train from San Diego to union station and stay in one of the LA Live Marriotts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angier157

The wait staff was excellent and hurried our meals right along as they knew we were going to a game. Got to the Center showed the attendant out tickets and we were taken to our court-side seats. Great view and to our surprise only a few rows behind Jack. Fun night. The Center worked hard to make sure we had a good experience and we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6901YHdonb
50,Clippers and Lakers game at Staples Centre,"We had a great night out watching the basketball at the Staples Centre, we got an Uber from Anaheim and got there early to get something to eat! There were plenty of places to choose from too! The staff were very helpful and showed us to where our seats were. We had seats really high up and couldn’t believe how big the place was. We really enjoyed our night there and it was something to tick off our bucket list while visiting America on our 6 week holiday from AustraliaThis is definitely something you must do while you are here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vikkir69
10,Tim McGraw & Faith Hill Soul 2 Soul Tour FINAL NIGHT,"We were very excited to get tickets to see Faith Hill & Tim McGraw. We are long-time fans of both country artists.This concert was at the Los Angeles Staples Center. The entire venue is known as L.A. Live! There’s plenty of restaurants and nightclubs and lots of people. Be prepared for large crowds and long lines everywhere.In spite of the great talent of both Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, this was by far the WORST large-venue concert we have ever attended. The overall show was a stunning spectacle. The lighting, visual presentation, and staging was all beyond imagination.What made the concert so bad was the sound. I don’t know if Staples Center provides the sound technicians, or if the performers bring their own. Either way, the sound was so loud and distorted that no one could actually understand any of the words. In particular, the electric bass and the bass drum was so distorted that the seats were actually rattling.I have a decibel meter on my cell phone. It registered sustained sounds around 110 dB, and peaks at 120 dB. If this had been a rock concert instead of a country concert, I might have been expecting that kind of volume.The only explanations that I can think of are that the sound technicians were incompetent or poorly trained in sound presentation, or that the sound was PURPOSEFULLY set so loud as to cover up the vocals.Unacceptable in any case. One can only hope that McGraw & Hill were unaware of how bad the sound was from the audience point of view. It’s entirely possible that their own in-ear monitors had sound that was ok.I wouldn’t like to have been some of the band members. There was really no reason to have a fiddle player on the stage other than for looks. Except for one brief solo, he couldn’t be heard at all.By coincidence, we are returning to the Staples Center in two weeks for a Shania Twain concert, so we’ll get a 2nd chance to see if the sound is again so loud and distorted.Also, one note about parking. The parking garage has a built-in bottleneck upon exiting. The signal at the street level only lets out a few cars each cycle. We paid the “full rate” for parking - $30 flat fee. After waiting in line almost 45 minutes to exit, the automated system tried to charge us an additional $10 because we didn’t exit quickly enough.Lesson learned - next time we’ll park in one of the off-site outside parking lots for the same $30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyplum
10,Faith Hill/Tim McGraw Staples Center Concert Had Horrible Acoustics,"This concert, on July 21, 2018, was ruined by a horrible sound set-up. The sound was screechy and distorted, you could not understand any of the lyrics. Our ears hurt after 20 minutes. We left after 45 minutes. Not really the headliners fault, it’s Staples. We attended an Adele concert there and the sound was great, so we know they can get it right. But they ruined this concert for us. Shame on them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilbK7868LW

A side note - Wished there were slightly healthier food and beverage options!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speedbunny
50,Great for Big Concerts,"Staples is a great venue for rock concerts. Have attended a few here. It is massive so get your tickets in your favorite spot early before the good seats are taken and you have to take a cheap seat in the farthest sections. Staples concerts are a blast, but the lines to go in can get long and the parking is very expensive too. I always get the parking ahead of time when I buy the tickets. There's limited food inside but it's definitely more worth your money to eat before the concert at one of the nice restaurants that surround the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123marissa
50,Wow! Every event there is like a feast!,"This is a huge place with many screens, so whatever is going on down on the field, is easily available on the screen. I went to see some basketball matches there, and have to admit the atmosphere is truly fantastic! The crowd around you gives you so much fun, and in a way you feel like a part of the large group. Parking is available around the place on privately held lots for the set rate. It can be crowded! Stil go for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac
40,Great place for Concerts,"Came to the center for a very memorable concert by Pink. Being not familiar with the LA area ( a foreign tourist ), I had some concerns about getting in and out.

50,Well worth a visit!,"If you eat a chance to see any American sport at the Staples Centre I highly recommend.We went to see the L.A. Clippers play and boy they put on a great show. We kit avid basketball fans but just for the food and entertainment it was worth it. The tickets only cost us about 25USD per person and we were quite a long way up, but that didn’t take away any of the fun (except we were out of range if the t shirt and hot dog cannons).The pre-match entertainment, the half time show and the spontaneous dance troops at every time-out were just fantastic. Coming from Australia we aren’t used to this type of spectacle so I think we appreciated it even more.Excellent time, crappy food and expensive beer!!! But who cares you’re at the Staples Center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sifterboy

50,Box Seats,"What a way to see the basketball. Private box in the Staples centre, private. VIP entry, included all you can eat buffet and free flowing drinks for the duration of the game. Great value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwayneC1980
50,GO Lakers!,The hotdogs are delicious. The only thing I didnt like was the security we had in our section she was very rude when asking for our tickets to verify we were in the right section.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isabee01
50,The place to be,"Went to an LA Kings NHL game on a Thursday evening. The previous Thursday I was in Ottawa, Canada for an NHL game. Ottawa doesn’t come close to the in game experience at Staples Center.Prices were excellent.Everything you need to entertain you is there. LA Live!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/June61992
40,Last game 2018,"Visit it often for concerts and games. Well designed. Sound system, air circuation, concession stands are very good. Lots of parking - can be pricey. Lots to do in DTLA, restaurants, theatres and sights. One can make a day out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbstentmd
50,Clippers games are a great budget option,"We’ve gone to two Clippers games at this point and they’re great for families with young kids. We’ve done suite level both times, which is cool (we paid around $40/person on stubhub), BUT the drawback is the t shirt cannons don’t reach that high. My 8 year old was bummed that she wasn’t even close to getting one (her odds were small closer to the court, but they were 0 in the suites). Also, the kids cam and kiss cam doesn’t really interact with the suite level. Just keep that in mind when you’re shopping for tickets. Being down lower may provide you with a better, more interactive experience.A few perks of getting suite level seats: separate entrance for suite ticket holders, clean, suite level only bathrooms, and a dessert cart service that goes suite to suite.We look forward to going to many more games at the Staples Center in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryanne1981

50,Kings game! Best night in a long time!,Our family of four attended the Kings game against the Wild. Now the game itself was highly entertaining and this was definitely an added thrill. With sports of course you never know what you’ll get. Also the Kings are my team so I might be biased here.The only drawback was that for whatever reason our ushers allowed people to walk up and down the aisles during play. This was maddening. I paid big money for these tickets and didn’t want to watch the game on the big screen. People need to sit and wait and the ushers need to be more strict with this for those who are enjoying the game.All in all this was a great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismM4414FK
50,Staples Center LA Clippers,My nephew and I had an awesome time at the LA Clippers game ! The staff was very friendly and helpful. So far we have been to a couple of arenas and this by far has some of the best staff. There is also a lot of food options within the arena and outside. Definitely recommend watching a game if you are in the LA area it’s worth the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L3944PCjacquelinel

40,Must see for basketall fans,"Staples Center is definitely a must see for Basketball fans while in LA. There are statutes surrounding the building with great information. ESPN is close, which my husband loved. We didn't see a game while there but were able to see the facility and it was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamikaNOTG
50,Easy to get to,"Easy to get to the Staples Center by car or train. You can take the Expo light rail line fro the Westside and it drops you right at the Pico Blvd stop. Parking is also very easy around Staples, but not inexpensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryTraveler240

40,Decent arena.,"Went here twice over a 2 weeks period for 2 different sporting events. The arena is impressive, We have great seats both occasions. There is a lot of food concessions available which all seemed to be ridiculously priced. The Staples store is decent, but also expensive. We parked a couple of blocks away in a small private lot for $10 which was reasonable for secure parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pattsi
40,Basketball,Went to the Bucks-Clippers and Lakers-Mav games the last two nights. My only comment is about the Lakers game and how boring the whole experience was. I felt like I stepped back 20 years. The announcer sounded like he swallowed the mic and no one around us couldn't understand 15% of what he was saying. Then the activities between quarters and at halftime were snoozers. We were very excited to see the Lakers in person only to leave with a blah experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherwC3598IH
50,Strike a Pose - What an entrance,Get your camera phones ready! The Staples center features nine bronze statues celebrating L.A.'s greatest athletes to play the game at the Staples venue. Inside I find the venue to be fairly typical. I do find Laker fans to be some of the most enthusiastic and kind. They respect the game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnaeb2016

40,Great views,"Recently booked tickets here to watch Lakers. Considering we were near the back the views were great. Bit overwhelming at first at high you are actually sat! Quite steep, so if you suffer with vertigo, it may be worth paying to be seated further down! Great atmosphere and great game. Easy to find. Lots of parking close by. Great security. Getting in and out was quick and efficient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flaassens

50,Once is a lifetime...,"First NBA game and what an insane experience. Got to Staples Centre early and had plenty of time to take in the atmosphere. Entered quickly and without fuss, bought souvenirs, had dinner, drank beers, took part in activities, talked basketball with Lakers fans and when home with free Taco vouchers (thanks Pistons for scoring under 100). Had good seats and had a great experience. Can't recommend enough getting to an NBA game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smuir0908
50,Fun time while watching the Clippers,Always wanted to check out staples center and the time was right. Got some clippers tickets for cheap and decided to make a trip. Great arena with plenty of room. The clippers do a great job of entertaining the crowd and plenty of contests and prizes given away throughout the game. Don’t do like other people around me and talk the whole game. Kind of ruins the experience but overall a fun time. Great promos also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephhS1183YJ
40,Lakers win! Yay....,A fun night watching the Lakers game - more spectacle than sport for the first three quarters and then a knife-edge final quarter to seal the game. Great family entertainment and one to see time and time again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving_Bill
50,What an experience,"I went there to see a Lakers game (vs Orlando). It was a fantastic experience. I got one of the cheaper tickets, so I sat way up high, but I still had an excellent view.If only we had stadiums like this in Belgium :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom_vdberghe
40,"Hockey game, out of town fun!","Went for Blackhawks/Kings game. Came from Chicago. Having been to a LOT of games at the United Center and other arenas, enjoyed my Staples experience. Lots of food options, lots around the area-- very safe in the daylight (at least). And the crowd was okay-- even though the Kings had an epic meltdown in the 3rd. Nonetheless, the crowd was civil to us in visitor's sweaters. Very clean, easy to get around.Our seats were low (about 10 off the glass). Would be hard to see hockey if you were upstairs as the center is high, and seats are pitched.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyl97

30,Beautiful place but...,"I can do without the club boxes. Very luxurious but you feel very distant from the action on the court (or rink) as you are looking down on the top of the heads of the athletes and, frankly, you might as well be watching the event on the TV in the room. The room is great for socializing with a bar and refrain and waiters coming in and out but if you're there to watch the game, there is better viewing elsewhere in the arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenR1901
50,Great Sports Venue,"Like all major sports arena, it is crowded and the food and drinks are expensive. But there were plenty of choices for food. Some vendors had long line ups and some not as bad. Although we were at a sold out Kings game, it wasn’t too crowded to walk around. Line ups for the boys bathrooms at least weren’t bad.There is airport style security on the way in and no professional cameras are allowed. It was fairly easy to catch a taxi after the game. We just walked a couple blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
40,Great Sports Venue,"Home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, this is a beautiful and functional arena. The suites are luxurious with plenty of food and beverage.

50,LA Clippers Game!,"I'm an avid basketball fan from Toronto, and wanted to see a game at the legendary Staples Center while I was in town. Great location downtown LA near a nice square with shops, restaurants and bright LA lights. It was a week before the All-Star Weekend comes to town, so they were busy getting things prepared, but that didn't take any focus away from the Clippers that night. As I walked in through security, I passed by all the iconic statues outside the arena: Jerry West, Gretzky, the new Shaq statue, Magic Johnson, Kareem, etc. Truly amazing to see in person. If you've ever been to the ACC in Toronto, that's all I've got to compare this to so keep that in mind. It seemed a lot smaller than the ACC but the seating was closer to the court and more gradual inclination. As a result, the row directly in front of me was too close and blocked our views more than it would at any other stadium. With that being said though, I definitely felt closer to the court and the action, which was great. I got the tickets off StubHub for next to nothing and wayyyyy less than face value. The food was actually pretty good in here also. Overall great night, great game, and awesome LA experience. Would try to see the Lakers here next time because that's a whole different vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGonthego
40,Lakers game and LA Kings Game,We came here twice once for an LA Kings game and once for a Lakers game. It's all really easy to find your way and heaps of staff around. You can't take backpacks or large handbags in. You can take a small A4 notebook sized bag in. Also you can't bring in cameras or go pros. Phone cameras are fine. If you do bring one you will have to check it and pick it up at the end of the game. The food was a little expensive bit that's to be expected at these kinds of events. We sat right up the top for the LA Kings game and the view wasn't bad. You could see what was going on really well in fact it was almost better to be up there for the hockey game. For the Lakers game we sat about half way up which gave a great view. I wouldn't of wanted to be up higher for the Lakers game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimksp

40,Best visit yet! Well sort of.,"We came to see The Killers' first date at Staples on thursday night. It was the first time we had an awesome experience from beginning to end. I digress. I wish the event staff could have been more attentive. There was jerk with an aisle seat that filmed the entire show on his phone. I'm not bothered that he bootlegged or live streamed the entire concert, but what does bother me is that he stepped out into the aisle to get a clear shot with no redirection whatsoever from the event staff...even after I made her aware of the issue. This wouldn't have happened at The Forum. The ease of entry and efficiency of the food and drink vendors are commendable however. Nice try Staples, but not quite there yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latindrummer2112

40,Nice arena,"Staples center has the same problems all places have, way over priced food for most items, sight lines setup up for the luxury box crowd, and not the best area around it to hang out after a game. But those are issues every arena has to one extent or another. What it has going for it is some of the nicest upper deck seats in California, a huge scoreboard that everyone can see, and some nice places where you can get food for less than $15 per person. I would caution those who have balance issues from buying tickets more than half way up the top deck for it's steepness, but otherwise recommend seeing a show there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darioprime

50,Great basketball venue,"Our family group watched a Lakers game at the Staples Center during our most recent visit to LA. Getting to the venue proved problematic as we had decided to use the Metro Rail to downtown and were planning to get off at Pico station. Unfortunately there was a problem on the line which delayed us and then the queuing traffic in the streets leading to Pico also slowed the train's progress. We had allowed plenty of time for the journey and looking at the traffic congestion as we neared Pico I was still glad that we hadn't driven in.There didn't seem to be many bars close to the Center so we headed straight in and bought pre game drinks inside, where the food and drink is expensive but convenient.We had a great view of the game and there was a really good atmosphere, so it was well worth going.The traffic congestion was even worse after the game, with a lot of queuing traffic leaving the Staple Center car park and trying to get to the 10 and 110. We walked in the opposite direction along the section of S Figueroa St that was still closed to traffic and had drinks in Tom's Urban bar, leaving the traffic behind us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000

Now, it has added a neighboring LA live with theaters and restaurants and a smaller venue. I have seen concerts, NBA, NHL, XGAMES and WWE events here. It's like there are no bad seats. Even the 300 seats are pretty good. The staff is helpful, bathrooms are clean. There's a stubhub ticket place right across the street. Parking is tricky if you're visiting, you have to park in a private lot which is usually cash only. You can park in the convention center or basement of LA live. No validations for staple center events. Great venues, plenty of concessions and plenty of bathrooms between sections. Easy to navigate in and out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taesian

We went to the box office and they had a good selection of tickets but they ones left were more than we had planned on paying so she suggested we nip over the street to a well Ik own ticket resale company where we managed to get VIP seating at a snip of the price. The staff were great, as were the facilities and whilst we didn't eat there appeared to be plenty of choice (including a 5 layer carrot cake - not sue how we resisted!)The layout of the seats is such that you have a great view wherever you sit, and the home team won so the atmosphere was fab.

Seats were in the upper section, but views are excellent from anywhere.

Food and concessions have great choices but it’s a destination for what surrounds it with LA Live. I did like the collection of statues of Laker and Kings greats outside to see. The banners in the rafters show the once great franchise history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biztravr
50,"Great sight lines, bring money, and have a good time","Great sight lines, bring money. Not an egalitarian local at at. The mega wealthy have their locations, either on the floor or in their private boxes and many of us are content to sit in the rafters. Great food and beverages and the location is superb. If you are at a convention you can cap off a day with basketball, hockey, or a concert. Hotels are nearby and the Metro station is a block away. Parking can be a pain and the lot owners charge based on the event. We always take the Metro. Easier to park elsewhere and avoid the crush of cars on Figueroa.

40,Great to watch the Lakers,"This is one of the most popular arenas in the US. We watched a Laker game and it was great. Lots of celebs in the crowd. It's remarkably large. The sets in the upper section where we sat are a long, long way away from the action. As long as that doesn't bother you, you'll have a blast. They could use a few more food options. The line for security for 45 minutes long to enter. Plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A69UNmichaelh
40,Great Concerts,"i have seen many concerts at Staples and have always gotten pretty good seats. yes it can be expensive, the food and drinks are outrageous but the best of the best perform here,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodiel534
50,Great place to watch Lakers,Went to watch Lakers' game. Part of LA Live area. Building is clean and entry is orderly. Must visit in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwidjj
50,Excellent venue for basketball games and concerts!,"I've been to the Staples Center about 10 times for Lakers and Clippers games. The views are pretty good even in the further seats. The premier VIP seats are nice because you can order food and drinks from your seat and have it delivered right to your seat... no need to stand in line and miss any part of the game. The closest paid parking is $30 but if you're willing to come an hour early and walk a few blocks you can park for free on the street. There are some good bars/restaurants nearby to grab some food and drinks before or after as well. I highly recommend attending this venue... clean, nice, and usually free gifts :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldtravelSM
40,Great experience,"We had a great night - venue is easy to navigate around, excellent atmosphere, lots of eating options in and out of the stadium.Lakers were poor and seats cramped but it didn’t matter",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hynet9

50,Staples Center is part of a fantastic sports entertainment hub,Staples Center is a glitzy looking stadium that hosts many Los Angeles sports franchises and hosts events and concerts for some of the most famous acts in the world. The stadium is in impeccable shape and is truly the best arena I have ever been to. They have a wide variety of food and many vendors so the lines aren't too long. After the game there is extra entertainment to be had outside of the stadium at LA Live. I would definitely recommend making a trip out to this arena.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickd401

50,I love this place,I always enjoy the Staples center. Very clean! These fans are loyal!! There are plenty of concession stands open during games and although the food is over priced it’s still decent tasting. Beware of the parking lots that offer so called valley parking!! We waited an hour to get our vehicle after the game,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damckin_99
20,I really don't know how much more I can take of this place.,"We go to Staples a lot, I mean about 12 times a year. We are sort of stuck in as much as some events we can only see there. I really can't stand going there at this point, it only gets worse every time. The parking, the service, the food, and the lack of women's bathrooms is terrible and they don't care. They think they have a captive audience. I have taken to driving out of town to see the same event just to avoid the misery that is Staples Center.1. Parking: The pricing is crazy, it can be anywhere from 25 to 50$ depending on the event. If you are handicapped, but not wheel chair bound you are going to be miserable by the time you get to the venue. They will try to force you to park in these structures that are at least a block walk from the venue. This is illegal and I have just about had it. There are spaces right in front of the venue, none handicapped marked and filled with God knows who, but not the people that need those spaces. You can arrive over an hour early and it matters not. So the start of your venture to hell is arguing with the parking attendant with a handicapped pass in your hand.2. Getting in: If you have Flash Seats which means you get in with your credit card or Drivers License, that is going to take some time. The staff gets confused and has all but the right information. When you say you are sorry, but you had no choice offered but Flash Seats, you will be told you are wrong, that you should have gotten paper tickets. This would be wrong. Some events do not allow for e-tickets. You go with Flash Seats or you don't go. And they speak to you like you are an idiot. This is especially fun when you have a delayed child with you that just wants to get in to the event.3. Don't Ask Where Things are. They Don't know: Being disabled is something many of us deal with us daily. I plan my trips so I know how far I can walk and then how far I can keep walking without falling. Now, I have walked a block to get to the venue, now I am standing for 5 minutes while the staff tries to figure out Flash Seats, and the fun has just started. My child wants his face painted. I ask where is that. I am sent in the wrong direction walking around this huge venue. I ask another and am finally sent in the right direction. I pass the two staff members who insisted I go the wrong way. I mention in a calm voice, you sent me the wrong way, just so you know, some of us have a hard time walking. The response I got, ""My bad."" WOW!!!!4. Don't buy food: The lines are absurd, the food is awful and the prices are absurd. I don't mind paying 10$ for a plain, little hot dog, but when it also sucks, well that is not fun. But hey, if you want hard liquor at a Children's event, no problem, have a double martini and drive your kids. Disgusting.5. Are Those Really Your Seats?: You get to your seats and someone else is in them. At this point I really need to sit, feet numb, child flipping out. I ask for help, no one ""does that."" Finally an attendant shows up. He sees my tickets, that are of course, exactly where they should be. He looks at the other tickets, clearly wrong, but we are going to discuss this? No, we really are not. I need to sit down please. I am at this point begging, just let me sick down and you can figure this out. He is holding my tickets saying, ""I know you are in the right seats, but wait while I try to figure this out."" Seriously. The people were moved where they belong (maybe had someone helped them in the first place they would have not ended up on the wrong side of the venue. The lights go down, the show is starting and my child is still not seating and is crying.6. Disney on Ice was great. Take your kids. Just take them to a different venue if you can. And again, we were there over 1 hour early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,LA kings,My boyfriend and I wanted to see what an LA NHL game would be like. We sat in the PR1 section and thought this was pretty good. We have been to many arenas around Canada and the US and both agreed the staples centre was very modern and clean. Everyone at the game were so excited and lively. The arena staff did a great job at keeping the crowd engaged and entertained. The LA Kings won and there was a party in the stands. Overall this was one of the best NHL games we've ever been too. We recommend checking this out!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875meaganl

50,A slick customer experience,"Having some spare time on a business trip searched what was on offer in LA. I had three choices Bruno Mars at the Apollo, Guns and Roses at the Forum and a home LA Lakers game. The Staples arena is fabulous and I’m glad I chose it. The area is surrounded by bars and restaurants, but I wanted to try food and beverage options, expensive but tasty. Purchasing a ticket is easy, via the website and released to your Flash Seat account a few hours before the game. And it was easy to scan and enter the arena. The Lakers sure know how to put on a good show too, pre game show, national Anthem performed by saxophone, all well executed. When in LA I’d do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winch1

50,As good as it gets....,"They say Madison Square Garden in New York is the world most famous arena. That might be true, but the Staples center is the world's most comfortable. There are parts of Staples Center (the suite levels) that feel like a hotel, with plush red carpeting and classy bars. There are multiple places to eat. Several craft beet stands, and perfect sight lines from every seat. Even the top deck is fine. The train lets off 2 blocks away. Great way to get there. Leave extra time for the long lines through security. It takes a while because they do their jobs....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soulart99

40,Staples Center,"During my stay in LA I’ve been there twice! If you’re an NBA Fan from one of the LA teams it’s totally worth it to go there. I visited two LAL games and would go a third time. Ticket prices are, I would say, normal if you happy with a seat in the upper areas. Haven’t had drinks or food, but I saw that a cup beer is about 10$, what is a bit of expensive I guess.

50,The Sports and Entertainment Capital of The World,I've had the pleasure of working as the In-Arena Host for the LA Kings for the past 9 years. This venue is by far the best in Los Angeles for live sports and concerts! Not a bad seat in the house. I've had the pleasure of seeing Dane Cook sellout the building for stand up comedy and even seen the Stones on their 50th anniversary tour while standing in the tongue pit!The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. From the ushers and concessions to ticket sales and operations staff this building is first rate in providing an excellent guest experience.Filling your belly with delicious food options is easy with a wide variety of menus available. Celeb chefs and local restaurants make cameo performances on the concourse with new and exciting dishes in a food scene that is always changing in Downtown Los Angeles. From sushi rolls to Ludo Bird you always have great choices for dining.But for me personally... nothing will ever top being outside for the 2012 Stanley Cup Championship Parade where 250k fans will the streets in support of their hometown team.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayflatsinc

50,Experience of a lifetime!,"We went to see an NBA game at the Staples Center - Los Angeles Lakers v Denver Nuggets. I bought the tickets via the Staples Center website from Australia. Then I downloaded an app that saved the tickets. On entry I just had to show the tickets on the app at the door. So easy.I paid about $250ea for seats close to the court. Worth. every. cent! My kids were blown away as was I. Such a great venue! Different to any we have in Australia.Food and beverage outlets within the Staples Center are run so so efficiently. Really well staffed, reasonable prices. Refillable popcorn and soft drinks! Impressive!Outside the Staples Center is the LA Lakers shop. It closes during games. So time your visit to the shop for when there are no games at the Center. Why they close during games is beyond me! Shop is huge. Mainly Lakers gear and the other LA team.We stayed at a hotel nearby and just walked to the game. Easy! If driving, lots of parking options nearby and not expensive.There is any area around the Center called LA Live (think that's what it was called) which has restaurants etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296sharona

50,Home of Many LA Events!!,"Going to sports events late night in LA used to be slightly dangerous. Although everyone should always be aware of their surrounding, LA is such a safer place to be.That being said, the Staples Center is wonderful! It is constantly the host of so many of the LA events including teams (Lakes, Clippers, etc) and concerts. Across the street is LA Live/Nokia. This area used to be so runned down and has been truly revitalized through the foot traffic and efforts of those who come.Having lived in LA for most of my life, it's really such a wonderful thing to be apart of and to see the people come together. I believe there has been a positive shift in the city and mentality of downtown and surrounding areas. I'm excited to see what's ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth

We sat in section 333, which offered great views of the entire arena. Beer, food and McDonalds right outside the section.We have been in many hockey arenas in America, but Staples Center is by far the coldest one we've experienced. Forget the lovely weather outside.

We love the atmosphere and the game itself - it makes for a great night out.We had premier seats and the views were completely unobstructed. Actually finding our seats was not the easiest and we did get a bit lost.We got popcorn only to find out if we had got the medium sized bucket we were entitled to free refills... but who can eat that much popcorn anyway?The burgers/fries all looked and smelled amazing and not the cheap rubbish food you usually expect at these events. Not sure if this was because it was premier seating though as we have been used to the cheap seating in the past!I wanted to check out the merchandise before leaving however I had to exit the building and re enter further away. They did not want to let me back in and when they did, the merchandise team completely ignored me and proceeded to pack up all their stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexxcx

40,Go to a game !!,"We went to the Womens basketball game here, great staff, good venue with decent views of the game even from cheaper seats, don't take even a small backpack as separate screening is a hassle.

40,Great Stadium!,I've had many great memories at this place. Growing up in LA I had my first concert here (Britney Spears Opps I did it again) haha and I watched my first Laker game and Kings game. This venue is a great venue. The 300 section gets a bit high in case you are afraid of heights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNicoleS375
50,Great modern venue,"Except the food prices which are obviously off the roof as in all american stadiums it is a great venue that offers concerts, lakers, kings and very cheap clippers games. Definitely worth it if you buy the six dollar tickets from stub hub!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler
50,Tim McGraw and Faith Hill concert,Great venue. Excellent concession. Parking price is excellent for the area. Parking prices fluctuate from 15 to 25 dollars depending on proximity. But all are good options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6776LQjaimec

10,Staples is poorly run and not customer friendly,"Went to Staples for a game last night. Someone in their hierarchy decided without telling or warning customers that they had implemented a new 'search all backpacks and diaper bags' policy. So, all attendees with anything bigger than a small purse had to go stand in one long line to have their backpacks scanned. They had one scanner. Two people working. Several people and two supervisors standing around. Offers to empty bags completely were rebuffed (""No it has to go through the scanner""). The fact that it took 40 minutes and many people missed the beginning of the game. Tough luck. Or as the staff AND THE SUPERVISORS said: ""We don't make the rules. We only work here. Don't blame us."" When I complained to the Staples manager, he lied and said we have been doing this all season. Well, I am a season ticket holder and have been to several games and this was the very first time I experienced it. So he showed that he was perfectly fine with telling an alt fact.I understand. I run a large operation. I know how essential it is not just to plan what you and your staff do, but also what the impact is on the customer and how that can be mitigated. No one did that second part. While I will finish up my season tickets, I will not spend any money on their concessions. And I will not renew my tickets for next season.They should be ashamed, but I don't know if whomever set up this operation has the wherewithal to know how incompetent the plan was. My season ticket rep was not informed of the change even though they have meetings with the Staples crew.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickBear

40,Great venue,"Visited the staples center for the Shawn mendes concert with my daughterIt's like any 20,000 ish seat arena, although I particularly liked the the seating arrangement. Almost all stars are good. Nice touch with numerous suites available too. Acoustics excellent and food choice and cost not too bad for an arena. More than just hot dogs and fries.The only draw back was no pass outs, so once you're in, be prepared to stay til then end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/designtraders
50,Sports Center of Los Angeles,"A magnificent venue for Los Angeles' best sports teams: Lakers, Clippers, LA Kings, not mentioning the fantastic concerts on many more events....2028 Olympics is next. Way to go!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753vladyc
40,Staples Center only if someone gives you a free ticket!!!! LOL!!!,"Staples Center only if someone gives you a free ticket!!!! LOL!!! The crowds are amazing. Most people are discourteous. Almost as bad as Dodger Stadium. I did not feel 'safe'. LOVE the sports events if one has really good seats! NOT in the 'nose bleed' sections. I have to be up close and personal with the sports event, otherwise I would watch on TV. Lines at hideous for food and bathrooms. Do not go to the bathrooms unless it is absolutely necessary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jess90069

50,Great Place for Sports 🏀🏈 & Music 🎼🎤,"Where ever you sit, any event, is easy to see. If it a concert it's a great concert. If it's men or women's basketball 🏀 it's always a great game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsF8241KC
20,Not the best concert venue,Saw Bruce Springsteen here on opening night and have been to other concerts notable Paul McCartney. Not my venue of choice. If you are in the nose bleed section the space in front of your seat is very small. I'm amazed someone hasn't died from falling in this venue. In addition the sound is muddy. If it wasn't for great performers you'd be miserable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,great shops,Very nice area to visit has some good shops and places to eat nearby and is on the hop on hop off city sightseeing route so its easy to get to if you do the bus tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835allans
40,Up to Snuff,"The Staples Center is precisely what you would think a big city's stadium for basketball, hockey and other entertainment would be. It's huge, slightly hard to park when crowded and has a lot of fast food. However, The Staples Center is also very clean and offers some more ""upscale"" food depending on the ticket types you buy for sporting events. The bathrooms are usually very clean (at least when the event starts), and the crowds are generally civilized. There are some very decent restaurants right next to it, and I recommend trying one such as Flemings beforehand (they have delicious rib eye).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,Laker game was amazing,Staples center is a top notch venue. Parking can be hard to find and security can be hassle at the front but once you're inside its great. Our seats were close enough to make out the players faces. 100% recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessee04
40,Lakers rule the nest here.,"Park along 12th Street west of the 110 Freeway for free. Then walk east about 10 minutes to the stadium. Place is always rocking. Lakers rule the nest here, followed by Kings then Clippers in terms of fan base.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1158THkevinm

40,"Fun Photo Opportunities, Outside Staples Center!","When we recently visited the Los Angeles area, there were no sporting events at the Staples Center, but that did not deter us from visiting LA Live and the Staples Center. Everyone in our three-generation party enjoyed walking around the center and taking lots of photos of the iconic sports hero statues. Most of the statues are so well known that only a first name is needed - Magic, Kareem, Shaq and Gretsky! Other statues include Jerry West, boxer Oscar De La Hoya and Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn. Fun times visiting the Staples Center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
50,Hockey and Basketball games are so much fun!,Nothing like a live hockey or basketball game here! 90% of the seats have an acceptable view of the arena/court. The building is well kept and clean.

50,Kings Game,"My friend and I visited the Staples Center back in January. It was by far one of the coolest places we have been to watch hockey. Our seats were great, and very easy to find ( we were five rows behind the glass).Parking is expensive, so be ready for that (LA is not cheap), but we still parked close enough, that when the game was over, we had no problems getting out.Good food selection, found the staff to be helpful, and found the security to be on top of things (we saw some fans fight, and security came down right away and escorted them out).My friend and I would come back for a Kings game again for sure! I also would not mind seeing an NBA game there either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhoward53

50,Go Clippers!,"We visited the Staples Centre to see the Clippers play the Jazz. We had a fabulous time. Everything is well organized and it was a great atmosphere. We sat in section 301 row 2. Therefore we were in the upper bowl, but we sat in the centre and close to the bottom of the bowl, so we could see very well. We considering sitting lower, but our seats would have been to the side and we might not have gotten as good a view of one of the baskets.

30,Lakers game!,"Once we got to our seats, this is a very good arena. We were up in the second tier behind the baskets and we really enjoyed the game. However, it took us quite a while to get in to the arena.

Fabulous time and we will definitely return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellover914
40,Clippers!,"I've been to over 50 games at Staples, very nice atmosphere. Been to a few concerts also. The seating is decent, the building is nice and modern. Decent food and drink options.

Luckily for me, there was a game with my Oklahoma City Thunder and Russell Westbrook, who with a last second field goal beat the Los Angeles Clippers! Beyond that, it was really a dream to be at the Staples Center, where countless legends had played and where until a few months ago Kobe Bryant was still playing.Speaking more specifically of the structure, it has a really beautiful layout with great organization; there was a short line to enter, a waitress who took orders, the ability to eat, drink and tease.

We had Suite seats for a recent Clippers game and the entire experience was very convenient. Parking was plentiful in nearby lots within a quick walk to the arena. Once we got there the amenities at the Suite level were great; service within the Suite, no lines at bars by our Suite, lots of open bathrooms, etc. I highly recommend seeing a game from that vantage point!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tyskyr

10,Why would you design an arena with a walkway that you get in trouble for using???,"I along with my husband and 2 college age children attended a Caps/Kings game in mid March. Our seats were in the lower bowl-section 107, row 10. Great seats behind the goal where the Caps shoot at twice. We were having a great time until my husband and son were returning from a food/drink run during the game and used a cut through aisle to get to our seats. Upon sitting, they were immediately approached by staff and told to ""come with us."" My daughter and I had no idea what the infraction was as we sat there taking in the game. My husband and son missed about half a period because the staff informed them that the pass through aisle was not to be used. Had they ever informed us as we initially took our seats? No. This really stinks because the tickets were not cheap and we bought 4 of them! Definitely the biggest disappointment of our west coast trip. We are season ticket holders at Verizon Center in Washington and I guess are spoiled by the arena staff there who treat us like gold and continually remind us how valued we are. Staples Center staff? Not so much. Were we pulled aside because we were wearing Caps jerseys? Hmmmm. Visiting fans, be warned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinamI5093JF

40,The home of the LA Lakers...awesome experience,My dream came true. An invite to see the Lakers at Staples Center with a VIP pass. What an awesome experience to see a world class sports arena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wikiphoto
40,Great venue for sports and music events,"Been to Staples many times for Lakers games, music events, and college basketball tournaments. The venue offers great seating and views, especially in the lower bowl sections. Downside: concessions prices are incredibly high. $10 beers, $7 sodas, hot dogs, and such, and the food ain't great. Parking at the LA Convention Center is convenient and reasonably priced. LA Live offers lots of dining options for pre-/post-game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobs85623
50,Went for an LA Kings game,"The Staples Center is an excellent, modern, sports arena. I attended an LA Kings hockey game while introducing a friend to her first ever major league sporting event. Everything went as smoothly as one would expect. Staples Center is organized and easy to find and get around. Go see the Kings, Lakers, or Clippers or give another performance a try. It is great for a sporting event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwesi
40,LA Lakers game,We bought some tickets on line on the resale site and was very easy to do.Was excellent stadium and well catered for patrons.Crowd were a bit quiet as Lakers lost but that was expected.A must do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwe003
30,"Great Arena, Terrible Parking","I visited the STAPLES Center for a Lakers-Clippers game, and both the atmosphere and the arena were very enjoyable. My gripe, however, is with the parking, which is a disorganized mess. I purchased parking beforehand via the Lakers website, and, not being from LA, I expected to be easily directed to my assigned lot and parking location. This, however, could not have been farther from reality. I drove around the arena for over thirty minutes trying to find my lot (Lot F), and asked as many traffic cops as I could if they knew of its location. Not one was able to direct me to the correct location, and none of the lots were clearly marked. I ended up having to pay again to park in a different lot, in order that I not miss the game. Overall, it was a great experience, but the terrible parking accommodations could easily have ruined the night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610elank
40,Very cool hockey rink and stadium.,I have been to allot of stadiums but this one was very nice. All the staff is so helpful. But the most surprising thing was the food. It was very good for a stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanky2

50,Lakers vs Cavaliers,"I have only attended a couple of NBA games here & each visit has been a fun one. The cost for parking is $25 off of Pico. There are several entrances to the building and I have never had to stand in a long line for admittance. There are tons of food establishments within so if you come hungry you will have a vast variety. The pizza spot (Blaze) inside is pretty good. For a personal pizza and drink expect to pay $16-$20. Dog Haus is also a good tasting spot. Those toasted buns are the best as are the nachos. Although the food lines are extremely long they are worked through well. There are several areas for sitting before heading into find your seats. I have only sat in the low 100s and 200s and have always had an awesome view of the game. However for those sitting up higher the monitor is huge and very clear. The seats are super comfy and spacious with attached cup holders on the arms and near the feet. While enjoying the game you have a chance to win free shirts, paraphernalia, and even gift cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latrundaj
50,Great Venue. We go there all the time to see the Los Angeles Kings in Action.,This is a great venue. Food and Beverages are a bit pricey but not any more than any other Sports Arena.

40,The action is hot; the sound system is not so hot,"there ar great sports events with lots of action and noise of course. if sitting near the floor at a basketball game it is hard to hear anything.As a concert venue, unfortunately the sound system just isn't very good. It can be exciting but if you really want to hear music well try the Forum, Greek theater or other places if they offer what you want. if you are into a loud experience thouh, it will work for you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj

50,Clippers Game,"We attended a Clippers game at the Staples Center and had a great time! The food choices are excellent, lines are minimal, our seats were great (and affordable thanks to stub hub), and the venue is amazing. We were able to Uber right to the front door with minimal traffic issues and our uber was able to pick us up with no problems. We left a few minutes before the final buzzer, but probably not necessary. Amazing place to watch a game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O554NMjuliew
50,Lakers / Pelicans Game,"Went to a Lakers game and everything went just perfect. The Parking beside was $30, but really comfortable, the entrance to Stadium was fast and easy.

50,Wonderful place to see sports!!,"Saw the Cavaliers vs. Lakers and had a great time. I love the Staples Center, located near many hotels. I thought the prices for food and alcoholic beverages were excellent. Cannot wait to go to another Lakers game (I am an avid) fan - even though they are not playing well at the moment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robfur
40,Laker/ Clipper Games,"This is a great Stadium, Even though it's older now it this maintains a modern feel, La traffic requires a lot of patience. Has a lot of great restaurants outside the Staples Center walking area. Food and Beverages inside is good, but a little pricey. It has many entrance, and it generally easy to exit. I enjoy going to the Staple Center and I go several times a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gisjac

50,Awesome venue,"Well after surviving the LA ""traffic"" to get to the Staples Center. I was amazed to find that parking right next door to the arena was only $25.We walked around the arena and I was amazed on how large the place is. It's hold just over 20K for hockey. The staff was very friendly in getting us in the door and finding our seats. Although our seats were in a different section, they allowed us to down to rink side to watch the players for pregame warm ups. The concessions stands are very spacious and quick. I don't think I waited 5 minutes in the longest line. The isle ushers were fantastic at keeping fans from getting to their seats while play was going on. They made them wait until there was a stoppage in play. After the game the place emptied out quickly and orderly. We got to our car and was out of the lot and back on the highway in less than 5 minutes. I was also grateful that the LA traffic was going the opposite direction I was heading. We made it back to our hotel in 20 minutes.All in all it's a outstanding facility and is managed very well. I can't wait to come back again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hlarsick
50,"Games, Concerts, They've Done It","Whether you are going to see the Lakers or to see a concert - this facility is easy to get to, clean and easy to navigate.The last time I was here was for an Adele concert my beau surprised me with. He also had the foresight to reserve a hotel within walking distance so we didn't have to fight the traffic leaving - highly suggested for anyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GChi-LA
40,First class venue,We saw the Blues/Kings play at Staples recently and came away very impressed with the venue. We had seats in the premier section and the waitress service was a nice touch but the whole section was fantastic - even a special entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelmutiger

40,Huge venue,"Not my favorite venue, because it is too big and holds too many people, but it is state of the art. They feature sports activities and concerts. I have seen big name entertainers there like Barbra Streisand and Il Volo. Just about all seats have good view, and just about all are assigned seat. This is the place for you if you like large crowds, which is sometimes unavoidable if you want to see a well known performer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltrivia
50,LA Lakers,"My husband and son watched two LA Lakers games here. They loved the different times of food available, the atmosphere and watching the Lakers play! Unfortunately they lost both games. They were given Lakers shoe laces the first game and a Nike ""Equality"" tshirt the second.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljr2612

50,A must to experience,We watched a Lakers game and the atmosphere was amazing. We found the food to be very expensive and not worth the money so I would strongly recommend eating before a game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946zoem
50,Dont care for the Lakers but...,I am a Jazz fan being from Utah but I love to visit other arenas and the Staples Center might be the classiest basketball venue I've been to. I don't like that they keep the lights off during the games cause I like to see the crowd but it gives it a new element.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmyr460
10,Most disrespectful Clippers fans,"Me and my husband went just recently to watch our Boston Celtics play the LA Clippers Tuesday and the facility is very nice, love the crowd, BUT as soon as we're leaving there's ""one of those fans"" that yells and cusses at you saying go back to the east coast. First of all, we're not from there, and have some respect. Definitely wont be going to any basketball games anytime soon there. Food was OK. Got to see Workaholics guys. That was cool. Overall was OK. #BostonLoyal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767gabrielles
50,Great Venue to watch Sports events,"Went here to watch a Lakers game. The Staples center is home to the NBA teams Lakers and Clippers, WNBA team Sparks, and ockey team Kings. This huge arena can seat 21,000 people. Outside the Staples one can see the sculptures of some sports greats such as Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar de la Hoya and Chick Hearn. There is also a big sports/souvenir store called LA Store. Inside the arena , there are several food stalls that include a MacDonalds. Parking here is quite pricey. We were able to park some distance from the arena, near Pico and Flower St.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabi0james
40,Good place for hockey,"Decent views all around, nice newer arena. The Kings were getting blown out for most of the game, so it was very quiet. By far the most diverse crowd I've ever seen at a hockey game!Lots to eat nearby, parking was no issue on the street within a few blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valzebub
50,HUGE place,"This was my very 1st Live NHL Hockey Game in my Life and I'm 61 LOL, my Husbands 2nd, What a Huge, Impressive Building, it held 18,000 people which was a Shock to us as that is as many people in our Whole Small Town in Canada. They had MANY Vendors selling everything from Food, Drinks, Liquor, and Memorabilia. We had a seat WAY up High but it had a Fantastic view in every seat. I found it cold in there but they need to keep the Ice Hard, The seats had Drink holders which were good but there wasn't ANY Leg room in front of you. I had lots of leg craps that night from not getting up enough and the cold so learned my lesson for the next game the next night in Anaheim. The Staples Center was incredible with everything to offer but Charged a Fortune for Everything you Bought just like most big Events like that. Wonderful to see a Live Game and they had LOTS of Entertainment in Commercial breaks and between Period, loved the Kiss Cam, Dance Cam and Surprise Cam on fans in the Seats and lots of fun and entertained by the games they played with Fans on the breaks, never a dull moment at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShereenB50

40,Leafs vs Kings game,"We have been to a lot of NHL arenas over the years and I have to say, if you have the opportunity to see a game here, go watch it. The start of the game they start with a laser show. We are in LA, so not too much of a surprise but we thought it was really good. We just don't do that in Canada.The arena is nice.There was a sold out crowd so lots of line ups. But overall the lines went quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimhF1359JT

50,Had a chance to hang out in a suite!,"We've been to Staples Center for concerts and had seats on the floor and in other sections but this time we got invited to a suite. Not only was the Laker game exciting to watch, the view and the food service was over the top. These suites are like hotel rooms minus the bed and bathroom. Your e-ticket barcode gets scanned at the door and you are in but only works once. So have someone inside at all times to open the door for bathroom breaks. Our host had preordered the endless taco package with various chips and dip, ceasar salad, fruit platter, fridge full of drinks, chilled wine in the bar and of course the famous dessert cart! Deadly double chocolate cake a la mode is what I had and it was decadent! Staples Center really knows how to treat their guests in the suites.On a side note, we parked across the street at the west parking structure for $30 (bit the bullet because it was close and possibly raining). Other bonuses included the Laker shoelace giveaway for each guest and quarterly magazine with Laker interviews and misc. articles. The Buss family really know how to create an experience. As soon as the game ended, cleaning staff came rushing in to clear out the suite for a Clipper game. Even the wooden floor was getting changed out for the game below. It's quite the money making machine.Sure the Lakers lost to the Spurs but the entire group had lots of fun just hanging out and catching up with each other. If you want to have a memorable experience at the Staples Center they are sure to give everyone a good time at all price points.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHinSoCal

40,LA Clippers Basketball match,"If you go to Los Angeles you must go to see a basketball match. This is a great show, you enjoy being there, even if you don't like basketball they make you enjoy the time you are there. My seats where at the PR3 i can say they where very good, you can see everything clear, they also include parking and access to the San Manuels club, cushioning seats, fast access to the stadium and food service to your seat (that you must paid)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilioBianco

Outside area seemed pretty safe for coming and going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
40,Huge!,"Better than average coliseum.

The venue was nice (albeit with crazy expensive parking) and has good food choices inside with it being one of the premier arenas in the world.Seating was good with nice space to cheer during the game.

I had promised my son we would eat there while watching the games, and as an out-of-towner, I was surprised with the food options. Expensive yes, but what a great selection. The long line-ups moved fast. The Staples Centre itself is huge. We found it (and the bathrooms) to be clean. Great view, although I wish there was a more leg room between the rows.

30,Don't sit in upper level,"I've been a Lakers fan my whole life, but never lived in California. I finally got to go to a game in person and grabbed up some seats on the first row of the upper level. I recommend paying the money and moving to lower seats. The top level has a small glass as a railing on the first row. There is no actual hand rail. I'm 5' 2"" and the glass didn't even come to my knees. If a person lost their balance, nothing would stop them from tumbling over. Just don't sit there. Lower level seats and the environment are wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kp1128
50,Watched the Kings Decimate The Islanders,"My first Staples Center experience was back in 2010 when the LA Kings blew out the New York Islanders. The arena is amazing! It truly is. Both outside and inside. The fans were also really cool and so too was Bailey the mascot!I also loved some of the signs that fans held up. One read ""Islanders fans are like fairies....they don't exist!"" That definitely had me laughing the entire night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983stevey
40,Warriors Vs Clippers,"My wife is a huge Golden State Warriors fan, and her birthday is getting close, so we attended last nights game at the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles. (Feb. 2, 17)We had a great time. The stadium is well maintained. It's a bit pricey, but what major attraction stadium isn't? Traffic is a bit annoying on the way in and on the way out but, traffic officers assist to get things moving a bit faster. Over all, I recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eandrade760
50,"Concerts, B-Ball, Conventions, Oh MY!","Staples center does and has everything. I even remember going there once for some type of convention!We've seen basketball games there, Prince in concert, so many artists have played here at the Staples center. Once the Harlem Globetrotters even performed here!People always complain about the parking surrounding Staples center but since they've beefed up L.A. Live there is a ton of underground parking available. Sure it is pricy but so are the lots nearby. I like the underground parking because it is away from the sun (if it's a sunny day) and seems cleaner and more secure than the outside lots. Frankly, it is closer as well. So if the lots outside cost $25-30 and so does the underground LA Live parking I'll always choose the LA Live. Try it once before you judge!The other thing I love about Staples Center now is that since they've done so much with LA Live as far as increasing venues there it is more interesting. You don't just have to go there to see something at Staples Center.Besides all the cool and hip restaurants and even a bowling alley that seems more like a night club, there are a few trendy, high end hotels near by. Like the Ritz. Try going to either their lobby bar or even taking the elevator up to their roof top bar. Views are spectacular!Don't forget Flemings is there, too. Oh, and at the holidays there is ice skating.Yes, Staples Center is the place to be!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven

50,KCon Music,I visited Staples Center during KCon. The place was easy to navigate and the staff was courteous when you had to go through screening. We had nose bleed seats but it still didn't see that far away and I really got to enjoy the concert without feeling like I was going to fall out of my seat (have almost done so at some baseball games).

40,Free chicken,"In LA for a few days we decided to take in a Saturday lunch time game, and a local derby one at that, the Clippers v the Lakers.Getting to the Staples Centre was easy from Hollywood with an Uber that was able to drop us directly outside. Entry was quick and easy with several staff who were able to direct easily to our seats.Great view from our seats on the 3rd tier and comfortable enough though pretty pricey for what was on offer.All in all it's quite a spectacle from start to finish...14 year old singing the national anthem (and brilliantly it must be said), army personnel marching around, lasers, fireworks, cameras constantly panning around the crowd and then eventually a basketball game begins. The kids were certainly impressed and entertained.The game was a damp squib as the Clippers quickly took a lead and never threatened to lose it. As such the game wasn't too captivating so the atmosphere was sadly lacking - perhaps not helped by the 12.30 start.Indeed the biggest cheers of the day came at the start of the 4th quarter when a local restaurant offered a free chicken sandwich to everyone in the stadium if a Lakers player missed two free throws in a row. One was quickly missed but sadly the second shot went through the hoop. The noise and excitement quickly disappeared.We left with two minutes to go and quickly and easily managed to grab an Uber from pretty much outside. A fun few hours for us all despite the game being poor. The kids loved it so I'd definitely recommend taking in a game if you get the chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haggis_Supper

The stadium is well laid out and easy to access. The bars and fast food shops ran well with efficient staff and the seats in the stadium enabled easy viewing of the arena from any point. A wonderful night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baylovers
50,Los Angeles Lakers,My family and I came here to watch the NBA game. It was everything we ever dreamed of. Being from Australia and are die hard Laker fans we made the most of this place. And were even happier when our team won.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf

Great food and drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
40,Great Place For Sports Events And Concerts,"I been coming here for years and seen sporting events and concerts.The seating is good but could use more leg room. The luxury boxes are great!

50,One of the best indoor facility,"We have attanded an NBA game at Staples Center. But this place is not just a basketball arena. Its like a living body, people enjoy their time in and our all around the Staples Center. There are some attractions around the arena, so you can start your fun time from outside and it takes you all the way inside until the game ends. My only suggestion is better to eat outside then go in. Because the prices are almost the twice than outside. Other than that you will love your day at Staples Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seyisoglu34
50,Great Night Out - Clippers vs Mavericks,"If you want to watch NBA in LA, then I can recommend getting tickets for a Clippers game rather than the Lakers as tickets are cheaper and more readily available. We managed to get 6 tickets for around $200 including booking fee, and while we were quite high, could still clearly see all the plays and players.Overall the whole evening was great fun, fully immersed the whole family into the Basketball culture and it all flew by.All the staff were friendly and helpful around the Staples Center, the crowd were noisy and the food and drink not hugely over priced - plus the extra discounts from the club stands for Christmas was a bonus :-)I would also advise to pre-book parking as you get space close to the center, although there are a number of private car parks locally that open late on game nights if you wish to walk a little further.Cannot recommend high enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigstuw
40,Great Venue for Basketball!,Every employee that we ran into in Staples was very pleasant. I commend Management for this. I do not observe this in alot of big arena's. The premium VIP seats were very comfortable. The only issue I had was that the server in our section did not come around frequently.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryP317
50,Awesome venue for Kings and Lakers game,"Went here on back to back nights for a Kings and Raptors game (they were playing the Lakers). Amazing venue for both games and we were in the 300's for both games. Parked at LA Live garage which was $30 but well worth it as exiting the lot was a breeze. Easy entrance in to the arena and easy to find seats. Great LA team store that is worth checking out. I am a huge Kings fan and have been waiting to see them play at home. Kings game had a great atmosphere with a true home field crowd. Cool to see retired numbers and Stanley Cup banners up close. Lakers game was great too. My Raptors won which was great. Not as great and atmosphere for the Lakers, but they have a young team and are struggling. Food options were great and not too crazy expensive. I will hopefully be back someday. One of the best arenas I have been too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ironleague

50,WOW Just WOW! State of the art!,"Down from the Bay Area for my birthday week with my boys, we are Warriors fans and happened to be in LA traveling from San Diego back to the Bay. The Warriors were playing the Clippers that day so I booked a close roo and scored 3 tix for $130. Once we entered the Staples Center, the 3 of us were in total awe of this place. Are you kidding me? Oracle Arena compared to this place is a dinosaur. Amazing shopping, restaurants, bars, people! We had a blast. Wish we'd arrived earlier to soak it all in but the Dubs won and the overall experience was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758kgh
50,A must visit Arena while in LAX,"Went to watch a Lakers game and had a great time. The places is great, with plenty of ammenities. Have to visit the Lakers store in the 1st floor.

50,The architecture of the Staples Center,"The architecture of the Staples CenterThis was presented by your retailer for office products, Staples.

This is one of Los Angeles's top architectural wonders",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri
50,Fantastic venue,"This past October was my 2nd time going to a Lakers game at the Staples Centre. Parking right there is easy and, I don't think, exorbitant ($25 or something?) for downtown LA. The venue itself is well managed. Lots of bars and food counters. Statues out front are awesome to wander around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,Excitement!,"This is one exciting place to be. Parking was easy to find in spite of huge numbers of people. Also seating was marked for easy location. We were there for a Lakers game and saw a great game. The seats are well arranged to see the game and the crowd added the spice. Also, the area around the center is fun to visit. Good food, drinks, movies, and even ice skating! It also felt very safe and was very well lighted. It's a definite must for a visit to the heart of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JujuPatty
50,Lakers vs Clippers on Christmas day,"The Staples center is a great and modern facility which was built in 1999. It hosts 2 NBA teams, hockey and many concerts. It is hard to believe that 250 different events a year are held here. It has a sign of Taylor Swift who sold out most in the center and all the retired jerseys of former Lakers players. We were lucky to get tickets for the Lakers vs Clippers game on Christmas Day. Fully packed we enjoyed the 3 hour game which is real entertainment. Despite the size (appr 20.000 people) you have good views of the field and the audio is really wow. Really worth a visit and hopefully you are lucky to get tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert-Jan1972

40,Nice arena but was dissappointed they had no Buzz Pop Cocktails,"The basketball game last week was off the charts. We wanted to have those great Buzz Pop Cocktails there but were stuck with a $12.00 beer. The arena is nice and centrally located next to the convention center. An all around great experience except for the lack of being able to get Buzz Pop Cocktails there. That product based out of :as Vegas is beyond delicious. Southern Belle, Mango Passionfuit and Caribbean breeze top my favorites. Guess I will have to get mine on the trip during to Las Vegas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joseph_Isaacs
30,Neil Diamond Concert,"Bad experience. We were on a first row of the balcony with a very long drop and a glass wall that did not appear high enough. We had some very drunk people behind us who were very disturbing. The staff were not helpful or supportive in this. The concert was ruined for me. Will probably no go there again,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2345YBlynnc

50,Love America Sports,"We watched the LA Clippers take on the Portland Trail Blazers on the first night of our holiday in November. Even though the match was pretty one sided with the Clippers destroying the Trail Blazers, it was still a very enjoyable experience.The atmosphere before, during and after was always friendly and fun. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful with nothing too much. The facilities within the arena and outside are second to none!There is a pleather of restaurants available outside, but they do get very busy on an event evening and the kiosks inside serve everything from McDonalds to nachos at very reasonable prices. Be sure to take your passport as ID if you want to purchase alcohol as out of state/country ID cards do not work!We even received a free model gift on entering the stadium and keep your eye out for celebrities at courtside...I see Floyd Mayweather, even though you couldn't get near him!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445markd
50,LA Kings NHL game,"Recently took my son to our first NHL game on our holiday from Australia. LA Kings vs NY Islanders. It was the highlight of our trip. Fantastic atmosphere, high speed, high skilled, and physical/brutal game. Atmosphere was electric after goals were scored. Having seen NBA, NFL, and MLB live, the hockey was definitely the best entertainment. Staples centre and surrounds were very safe and good food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmygz123

30,Clippers Game,We went to the Clippers game here and there was a lot of temporary fencing up for the American Music awards so it felt a bit enclosed when entering.One problem was waiting in line to get into the centre through security. We arrived a bit earlier so we would be able to buy some merchandise. There was no indication when the doors would open and we were waiting in line until about 45 mins before the game started. While I understand that they have to ready the venue after the hockey they should advertise when the doors will open.I feel that it is a security risk to have that many people waiting outside before they are inside the building. Minimising groups of people should be a priority especially when there are temporary fences blocking easy access and retreat in a situation.The security were friendly and I appreciate them doing their job and keeping things safe. The venue staff were good but the place felt a bit void of any real hype before a game. The merchandise area was ok but again it felt as though there was no real hype about the game through the venue.the view from our seats up in the nosebleed section was pretty good and the game was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydmandi

40,Great Place to watch a Hockey Game,"The Staples Center was clean, and easy to navigate. Staff were very helpful, and would go out of the way to help out-of-towners (we were wearing Blackhawks Jerseys). Plenty of places to get food and drinks. Getting in and out was not an issue. Only thing that could have been better is if the Hawks would have won in OT.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrin2
50,Fantastic place to watch basketball,"This was our first chance to watch professional sport in the States and we experienced the Clippers v the Thunder.

50,Go Kings go. Go Ice Crew go.,"This was our second NHL game on our USA vacation, and we know little about hockey, but are loving the live game experience. The Kings website states that additional tickets go out for open market sale at 1pm on game day so keep an eye out for that. We were able to pick up some row 8 centre ice tickets at 1pm on game day. There is plenty of entertainment, bars and restaurants in the immediate precinct of the arena. Only a few minute wait for us to get in 45 min before puck off. Purchased some merch from the merch store. While there was a massive line in the saturated store, the cashiers moved the line through quick. Next we met the Kings Ice Crew. These beautiful little lady's were selling 2017 calendars of themselves (in swimsuits) for charity, and the calendars were selling like hotcakes. We caught up with 8 of the ice crew girls and everyone of them was happy to pose for a photo, sign their month in the calendar and have a yarn. On to the hockey. Plenty of ongoing entertainment every time there was a break in play. Beer and food, reasonably priced as stadiums are, so too wait times for amenities. The Kings won. Happy days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieJustine

50,First Basketball Experience,This was a great night out at my first basketball game. Atmosphere was great. It was easy to get in and out without much of a delay. Be prepared to pay $12 plus for a beer though. Food and drink are so expensive. Lakers won and kept the other team below 100 points so we won 2 free tacos :-) Great experience if you can afford crazy ticket prices (Ours might have been more expensive as it was against Golden State),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227gracek
50,Great Facility for Both Hockey and Basketball,"We recently watched a hockey and basketball game at Staples Centre. We were very impressed with the layout of the facility, view from the seats and the amenities on site. The area around L.A.

It is a good family atmosphere that seemed very clean and safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandTraveller132

Always had a smile and willing to answer questions. Atmosphere for the game was fun and entertaining, fans for both teams were energetic.I also enjoyed seeing the history of the LA Lakers.

50,Court side seats for a Clippers Game,"We were fortunate enough to have a friend with court side seats for the LA Clippers. The arena itself is really nice and modern. Very clean and well organized too. It was a great place to see a basketball game. It was so much more than just a basketball game though. It was entertaining from start to finish. They do a great job of wowing the crowd during the entire game. Both of our kids, age 16 & 10 were mesmerized from start to finish. I highly recommend it. Would love to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsW93
40,Good views from above.,Had a good time at Staples despite being on the upper level. Adequate height difference for each row to give good views. They are pretty strict on the bag checks though.

As part of our ticket package, we got to shoot pucks on the ice before the game, enjoy a private room with bar and buffet across from the Kings locker room, and sit in between the two benches -- for the Kings and (that night) the Ducks. We literally had to walk across the Kings bench to get to our seats. I could have grabbed a roll of tape on the way over, but for Mr. Security. The Ducks players were flirting with my co-worker (and the Kings won! You're welcome, fans!). We were on TV. We were banging on the glass. We had a blast, getting more free food between periods.

But you go for the fun of it and boy was it fun and I don't even follow hockey!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr660
40,Good Venue For Sporting Events,"Generally, I visit this venue for sporting games and even in the 300 level you have a good view of the court. I would recommend opting for 200 level seats or if you have to get 300 level seats go for the center section.The only knock on this venue is the lines can be lengthy to get into games and make sure you enter closest to your seats to get in quicker.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveleatcomplete
30,"Bad view, many blindspots on the low cost seats","Okay, I didn´t choose the most expensive seats. But 100$ to see a regular season hockey game and have to see most of the game on the screen because there are many blindspots, it´s not really a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcustulliusc
40,Great Venue!,"We were able to secure seats for the Kings' home opener vs. the Flyers. The game stunk (Flyers won) but we were able to see a world-class venue and a great crowd. Being Hurricanes fans, we don't like the Flyers. We are warmly welcomed by Kings fans. Food, and beer, were great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeT443
40,Kings 50th anniversary game!,"Was fortunate enough to score tickets in a suite for this game. Wayne Gretsky and other hockey greats here. Great stadium with huge Jumbotron and many spectator games. Weird that the Flyers beat the Kings by the exact score that the Kings won with 50 years ago. Restrooms are clean and lines not too bad. Try to go during the game, much easier. If you're fortunate enough to be in a suite, don't miss the desert cart at the end of the 2nd period. Huge taffy apples and all kinds of cakes and brownies. Traffic around the stadium is heavy and parking is expensive, around $25-30. Just bite the bullet and take it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rottman

50,Seeing the Lakers play at Staples live!!! Wow!!!!!,"While holidaying in LA recently we were gifted some tickets to see the Lakers play at this venue. Once we arrived at the centre we found it was quite easy to get paid parking. For regulars it probably isnt cheap but when you dont know your way around except via a GPS you just park where you can & pay the fee. This centre is huge but going through bag checks & ticketing was actually very quick. When we entered the arena i was blown away with just how steep it is. I was jumping out of my skin with excitement the atmosphere was electric the crowd were pumped. Our seats were quite high up but we didnt care, we came with no expectations & left ""Lakers"" fans. For us being at such an iconic venue watching the ""Lakers"" was the ultimate.We had a fabulous night & the whole night went smoothly it was awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortez48
50,A great place to take your out of town guests-just to enjoy the energy,"You don't have to be attending an event at Staples Center to getthe most out of the area: it's hopping with restaurants, movietheatres, etc but MOST OF ALL , you can just go and people watch, because it is a bee hive of energy-and interesting mixfrom those who have limos delivering them to concerts (orsports activities)to the rest of us who just go to grab a cup of coffee at Starbucks and survey the scene.

50,Watching the L A Kings,Went to see the L A Kings play there first game of the season was amazing night go to see Wayne Gretsky and stars of past and present shame they lost the first game of the season but I have to say what a amazing venue and a great night the only crap point was that my cousin had paid for her disabled parking when we came out they had parked another row of cars behind our truck which made getting the car out nearly impossible we managed it don't be so greedy and respect your patrons who buy season tickets year in and out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garry2574
50,Great concert venue,Saw Adele here! We had nose bleed seats but still had a great time. Able to see her and hear her voice. Would recommend this venue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretaGarboFranklyn
30,Adele was awesome!,Of coarse Adele is great no mater where she sings but be prepared to park and walk a mile . Down town has major construction going on and high heals are not recommended . There was a concert going on in front of the main entrance with gates and everything was blocked of . There are several ok food choices inside and a few on the outside. Be prepared for long lines and slowwwwww service. We chose to eat tequila chips and churro's at the Mexican stand and it was pretty good. Downfall was that there was no where to sit and eat it.When the concert was over we were all shuffled and gridlocked out in the front of the building due to all the gates still beating up. It was dangerous and people were pushing and shoving. My advice is to wear comfortable shoes in case you get stuck walking or being shoved in close quarters or people will be stepping on your feet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805lisag
20,Great once you get there,"We went to Staples Center for a family event in the middle of the day. Even though we didn't have the best seats, I liked that we could see everything well. The problem isn't with the venue itself, it's the traffic and the neighborhood. Even though this facility is right next to the freeway, expect to be in annoyingly aggravating traffic once your event is over!This is not located in the safest neighborhood. I would not suggest parking anywhere on the street. Both you and your car will want to be somewhere with some security. In my opinion, Staples Center isn't in a neighborhood that I consider safe- especially after dark. Give yourself plenty of time both to and from due to crowds and traffic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930DH

50,Fun night,"Watched the Kings play their preseason game, and Staples was an awesome revenue for that game. Loved it and would do it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masonr654
40,Great for Sporting Events,"When Staples Centered opened in 1999 I was skeptical. I was loyal to the Forum in Inglewood where I saw many Lakers games and a few concerts. But Staples Center quickly made me a believer. There are many great things about Staples Center but two stand out to me.First, the food. They have a great selection. I remember eating hot dogs and nachos at the Forum as a kid. Staples Center has everything from pizza to turkey burgers to steak. They have multiple restaurants in the arena. There is also a huge bar that overlooks the arena floor.The other thing is the seats on the top level are not too steep. The person in front of you doesn't feel like their under your feet. Being on the top level is not as bad here as it is at other venues. The Honda Center is especially bad in this regard.The biggest draw back to Staples Center it does have bad acoustics. It was built for Sports not music. That's something to remember if you are going there to see a musical act.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Volume_10
40,Great view.,"If your going to the staples center the biggest thing is parking. Parking is horrible in LA just close to impossible to get any free public parking especially if there is a event there. They are building the microsoft center right next to it so some spot are under construction. That have statues of jerry west, karim and magic johnson if your are a sports fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevind473
50,Adele!,"The staples center is one of my favorite venues. Though I don't always go there is plenty always happening here. Lakers, clippers, kings hockey even the sparks contribute to sporting events September-June. You'll find a concert somewhere in the middle of the schedule or ice show even circus.What I love most of staples is that there is no mandatory parking like the rose bowl, or the forum or other venues. Plenty of street metered parking that is free after 6-7pm during the week and weekends. Not only that if you don't mind walking a bit you can find parking anywhere between $5-15 which is cheap considering many Venus start at $10 or more.Staples is clean, still very modern even though it's nearly 20 years old you can't tell. AEG keeps it up to date and it shows. Kings games are my favorite here as anywhere you sit is good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32eldena
50,A beautiful sports arena.,"The Staples Center is in downtown LA, within walking distance of several many fun places to visit. Visitors will relive LA Live broadcasts, view sculpture of famous sports heroes, and can dine in a variety of nearby restaurants. The convention center is next door as is the JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton. My favorite restaurant across the street is Wolfgang Puck's Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArleneB435
30,Great Venue - Horrible Acoustics,Staples location is surrounded by great restaurants and hotels. Limited parking to speak of at best. Came for a Carrie Underwood concert and couldn't even hear the words to any song. Horrible sound system. Loved the concert but not sure I would ever pay so much for a ticket when I can't hear the artist here. Need a smaller venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8722HLericb
50,Staples Center,"Great place to see a concert, or Basketball game, Hockey Game which I have done. For a concert the acoustics are great and if your willing to pay the price most of the seats are great. I have enjoyed Hockey and Basketball also. In addition to Staples there are several restaurants within walking distance. From fine dining to casual fare.Also, there is ample parking. I would suggest arriving early and have a cool one before going into Staples. Great location. There is something for everyone, but I wouldn't recommend it for a rainy day outing. It is more a destination location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813nelsonc

30,"The upper deck, for the poor folks, is indeed poor","The Staples Center is a nice, new arena with lots of amenities. But if you are not a celeb or high roller and end up in the upper deck, just realize its not going to be all that great. I have been in many arenas and the upper deck sightlines of the Staples Center may be the worst ever. We went to a Kings game and literally sat in the top row at center ice. Yes, I don't expect to feel close to the action but if someone stood up in the first row of the upper deck, it literally blocked 1/3 of the ice where that person stood. It's hardly different than if the person right in front of you stood up. Basically the pitch of the upper deck is such that your sightline tracks the tops of everyone's head so if one person stands up, good luck. Maybe its better for Lakers games with the smaller court or in the corners/ends of the upper deck. But if you think you are getting better seats by being at center ice/center court, think again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeLaird

40,Great sound for concerts but parking is a nightmare,"For sporting events, Staples is pretty good. Concession lines can be long if you are not on a VIP level, but they are not worse than anywhere else. Premier seating with in-seat service is highly recommended. Suites are nice too, and perfect for business networking, but the view of the game is not great from that vantage point. Where Staples really shines is concerts -- the sound here is really awesome. Be aware that the announced time is generally long before the actual start time. Try to get set times or at least assume that you may have to wait around after you arrive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmfesq

30,Wanna See a Basketball Game with the LA fans?,"I went to a Clipper game against a weak 76'er team. It was ok . We had very good seats about 10-15 rows behind the Basket. The owner was sitting right there behind the basket in the front row.It's a Clipper game so not as exciting as the the old Championship Lakers. Ticket prices are based on the quality of the the opponent. So if you see a good team, you will pay more. Our tickets were around $95. The luxury box seats take up quite a lot of the mid level tier so I think a cheap seat would seem rather high up I heard from fans that the cheap seat view isn't as good as it was at the old Forum. But if you are an NBA fan visiting LA then it is a good experience to see a game there.The area right around the Staple Center has many new improvements like upscale restaurants, ESPN and the MIcrosoft Theaterr(hosts the ESPYS and other tv show events like IDOL).I drove 4 to 5 blocks away and find a cheap $5 parking lot. So that was a plus. If you park further away from the Staple Center like I did then I wouldn't recommend hanging around too long after a night game. Downtown LA has never been a night time fun zone like other big cities. In fact it can be quite dark and desolate. Just be aware of your surroundings.It is an interesting place to walk around during the day. There are numerous statues of former Laker greats as well as the long term announcer Chick Hearn. I also heard that you can have lunch/dinner in the restaurant which probably does not have a view of the court.Overall it was a pretty good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8976FYpaulb

We attended Tina Turner a few years back and had to pick up tickets at will call - along with just about everyone else. Needless to say, we missed the first 20 plus minutes of the concert due to Staples Center lack of organization. Fast Forward to last night 8/9/16 for Adele and with the same will call scenario - we were able to quickly and efficiently get our tickets, and still enjoy time for a drink before the concert began! We also enjoy Clipper and Laker games and find the site extremely manageable for these events. Parking is pricey - but there is plenty of it - and even more if you are willing to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598elizabethf
50,Times Square Meets Madison Square Garden Meets Mega Food Court,Great concept. Really cool at night. Felt very safe walking around. Nearby hotels were the JW Marriott & the Luxe Hotel. Both nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriea991
20,Bad venue for a concert,First of all - just getting in to the arena is a challenge as the streets leading to the parking garages are coned off so all cars have to go around several blocks to get back to the parking garages. (taking over 30 minutes!)We paid about $200 each for concert seats that turned out to be one row from the ceiling. We thought at least the sound should be good. Wrong. All we got was muffled echo. At the intermission we thought about leaving but decided instead to stay downstairs and listen from one of the doors to the lower seating area. Much better. But there is no excuse for the acoustics to be so bad that no-one can hear from the upper seating areas. This may be an OK venue for basketball but I'll never go to a concert there again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSCats
30,Facility great! Organization terrible!!,"We went for a KCON convention. The facility itself was nice, but the organization was terrible!! I understand that part of the issue was the crew from KCON itself, but the way the security handled the lines was absolutely terrible!! My daughter waited in line starting at 1pm for a 5pm event, then were told that they had to line up somewhere else. So, they did. Then, when it was time for the event, they let another group of people that were behind them go in first!! And a few of the security team members got into a verbal fight right in front of these kids! I hope Staples center has several training sessions for this security crew. With that said, there were some security guards that were very professional and nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G5028LPcatherinem
50,Fun and fantastic,"Obviously, the enjoyment level will depend on the interest you have in the game or the event, but Staples Center itself is a fun place to go, no matter what. The energy can be great and the food options are plenty. I recommend not rushing and walking around to see all the different areas that are open to those with tickets. Also, give yourself time to walk outside and enjoy views of the building from street level. There will still be lines in bathrooms during breaks, so avoid them by going before and after. Parking can also be limited, so go early as you'll have plenty to do before the event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaBalt
40,Event suite experience,I attended a business event and watched the Lakers lose. I enjoyed the food and drink a lot more than the game. Wonderful catering and bar staff. The suite was very nice and the seats comfortable. The view was amazing. It was a good place to entertain guests. Avoiding the queues by the private entrance made the whole experience stress free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956AndH
50,Whoop Whoop!,"Games, Shows - these guys know how to make an event worthwhile. If you can afford it, get one of the Hyde Lounge boxes - pricey but fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555billt
30,Events Are Fun,"Seeing a live event is always fun and the Staples Center is a good venue. I don't know anything about the parking because my husband and I always take the train. We take the train in, have a happy hour drink nearby, and then go see the game.The view is good from every seat. There is service to the seats if you don't want to wait in line at the bars or food counters, but the food and drink is expensive either way.I see hockey games there and the special effects are nearly nonexistent. It's disappointing when you see the exciting effects at other arenas. The Staples Center is way behind other arenas in that respect and I hope they modernize soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abrasrose
50,Sparks Game,"We attended a Sparks game and had a great time!!! Our seats were really good for the price!!! We loved the half time entertainment and it was an exciting experience and game! We had a group of teenagers, young and old married couples!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simrlty

40,Nice venue...depends on what you're going to see...,"The venue itself is clean and nice. And the surroundings restaurants have kind of built up to support whatever is going on at Staples Center. Parking can be difficult and expensive. But really, being there is more about whatever event you're going to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3022NRlisag
30,Usa vs china,"We have never been to a basket game, so this was cool. The have like real food, McDonalds and different kind of food.

30,Anime Expo,"I attended Anime Expo here and I was really impressed with the size of the convention center. Unfortunately I felt like the actual staff of the convention center didn't really care what was going on, we dealt with some really great employees and some really irritating ones. I was impressed with the amount of people the building could hold, but it was scorching hot inside, bring a handheld fan with you so that you don't roast to death.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roselothbrok11
40,Barnum & Bailey circus,Had a great time on VIP suite. Parking was close and all around venues. Clean. Staff was very friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariapW9800UR

All the stairs, elevators and escalators worked great. We had over 14,000 people and it was perfect. There was also lots of security. We all felt very safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGX457
50,Home of the greatest sports teams,"As an LA native, I am incredibly partial to Staples because it is the home to the Lakers, Clippers, and Kings - all teams I root for. Great for games. Nothing spectacular beyond it being a good venue for sports and concerts. The grammys are hosted here, so there is that, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msa23_2000
50,Excellent attraction...,The same day we arrived had already booked online tickets for los angeles lakers game. Although we were tired from our flight we went to the game. Atmoshpere was astonishing. First time saw a game with live orchestra... Giving the rythm. Also the crowd was very enthousiastic...they sure love their team. I definetely book for another game,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arissp
30,NBA lover,"if you are/were fan of Lakers, this is a must place to go! could totally felt the energy from just seeing outside the stadium!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chinchilla520
40,Nice to see a game,"Aside from seeing a game or a concert, and perhaps doing some shopping in the area and staying at the hotel next door, no other reason to go here. Don't know why so many cities are buildings as somewhat white elephants, but such places seem to be built in areas that needed revitalization and were previously dangerous. However, I rated it very good because it is a very modern facility that meets its purpose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899
50,excellent for sports,on recents LA trips I use the staples quite a lot for sports NBA/NHL and WWEalways spot on staff and easy to access / quite a few reasonably priced food outlets close by as its quite expensive inside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisThom666

30,Beware of concert acoustics,Great place for a sporting event but beware of going here for a concert. We've gone to several concerts there and have always been disappointed. Good food selections and usually concessions stands have lines that move right along.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7473PKmichaelg
50,First concert here,"This arena is great because it's located within a few steps of restaurants and bars. I took my daughter there for a concert and was surprised how all the restaurants were filled with people, and also people walking around. (Many arenas are surrounded by parking lots only and nothing else, so this was a very fun experience.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvatrdly
30,Construction Surrounding Area,Great Customer Service and Guidance when in the Arena. Please be very cautious if first time visitor and driving in vicinity as area is under construction. Would advise taxi services.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferkF7064RG

40,Cramped Seating in an Otherwise Nice Venue,"I went here to see the Selena Gomez concert at Staples, seated in section 318. The venue is generally nice and still pretty new looking. My only complaint is that the seating (think airline seat) was small and the aisles were also very small. Did the builders ever consider occasionally someone may want to go to the bathroom or get a drink without stepping over a bunch of people? As usual when greed and common sense compete, greed usually wins. Yes cram as many people into the venue as it can hold and we will make more money. Wouldn't want to be in there during a fire or earthquake as it could be a deathtrap. People would really have a tough time getting out. I am amazed the fire department lets them get away with this setup. It's an accident waiting to happen (think liability Staples Center).At least Selena Gomez was excellent. She is beautiful, sexy and talented. Nice job by Selena, her band and the backup bands too.I parked in the West Hall for $20 which wasn't too bad and not too far away from the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnB00007

50,Love this place.,"One great thing about living in LA is there entertainment! Staples is a great place to see anything. Yes, it's tall inside. It's a bowl shape like the Forum but that's okay. I love sitting in the high sections. I typically go for concerts. I've never had a problem with the sound quality like some people have . The best part of Staples is it's an easy in and out of the area. Park off site is key!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526fannym
50,Lakers games,"Every time lakers and kings play I go see there to see them. I have been in the vip, suite, center court seats, and seats 5 rows behind court side. Staffs are always friendly and eager to assist in direction. My favorite is the restaurant in the vip section.Do not bring Swiss knife with you, they will take it away even if it is linked to your key chain and its so tiny that you can't even hurt anyone. I had mine taken away from me couple of times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc

If you know what I mean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhawaniPathania
40,Excellent Facility,"The Staples Center accommodates many events in Los Angeles from sports to concerts. It's accessible and well laid out. As with all such facilities, the concession stands for food and beverages charge exorbitant prices but this is to be expected. The majority of the seats afford good views of the events. It's really a very nice stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
40,Great place to watch the LA Sparks,"The LA Sparks (WNBA team) plays there as well as countless other sporting and concert events. Located near public transportation, lots of parking lots (although the lots tend to be expensive closest to the Staples Center). Food is OK, overpriced as is typical for these types of venues. There is a McDonald's that serves moderately priced food (more expensive than neighborhood McDonald's).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P9218BCchrisb
50,Concerts and Sporting Events,Great for Concerts and Sporting Events. Eat across the street at LA Live restaurants. Park at side parking lots for cheap!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmdigi
50,A great place to see a Kings game! #GoKingsGo!,"I'm a huge LA Kings hockey fan so whenever I get to LA I try to see a game at the Staples Center. It's a fantastic venue for hockey, not a bad seat in the house. I ate at the restaurant before hand inside the arena (the name alludes me now) but it was great too! Easy to get to and from your seats, easy to follow maps and guides, intermissions are made easy to get around and find a place to get a drink...couldn't have been happier with my experiences there! Plus outside LA Live is something you have to experience on a Kings game day! So much energy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismQ4711XU
40,Fun time watching Lakers,It was fun to see the Lakers on their home court. The photos which were hung around the hallways depicted previous events at the center. The food was good. Just wish the seats weren't so expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trekduet

50,The Who,"My husband and I saw The Who here, while on a business trip in L.A. This place is ENORMOUS. I've never seen a bigger arena in my life. The prices for food and water were not as expensive as I expected them to be, but you will pay. Great venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myjenyoung
50,Excellent Venue,I've been here a handful of times to hockey games and to other places around the center.

40,First Visit Will Definitely Return,"Went to see The Who last week. I was impressed by many things at this venue -- the food options, the cleanliness of the venue, the friendly staff, and the acoustics. If you are not on the floor level be sure to bring binoculars. Do yourself a favor and take the Metro Line straight to the Staples Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558bethm
50,This place is awesome and very intriguing,It is so fascinating to see how this arena converts seamlessly from basketball to hockey in a matter of hours. Night one we were seating watching the Clippers light it up... and night 2 we were watching the puck slide on the ice. This place is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHAMChris
50,"Perfect for Sports, Great for the Grammies","I go here for 2 things: sporting events (especially Lakers & Clippers) and the Grammy Awards. The accoustics in the venue get super good at Grammy time. Not so good when the basketball floor is out, but they take that away for the Grammies. Also, if you get a ticket to the Premium level at ball games, there's a great buffet called San Manuel Club. All-you-Can-Eat for a set price. Prime rib, sushi, deserts...lots & lots of upscale food. You'd never know about it unless you get PR seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottRHansen
40,"Somewhat Dated,But Still A Decent Venue","Located next to the LA Convention Center, this is a relatively nice place for a concert or game. The Lakers, Clippers and Kings all play here, and they host many concerts and other events. We've seen a concert there (Justin Bieber) and it was well done.Parking is conveniently located nearby in parking garages, although there is street parking available around the center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robogator0
50,"Call me biased, but it's like the Mecca for me","I lived in California when I was little and getting into sports. I embraced LA Laker basketball. I was a Kings fan. I moved away and still considered these two teams to be my favorites. That hasn't changed aside from the fact that I've changed my hockey allegiances.Still, it's pretty special to arrive at the arena, see the statues of Magic Johnson, Wayne Gretsky, and other legends and not feel a little nostalgic or get caught up in the history of the franchises, even if any of the special moments I remembered took place at the Great Western Forum.The arena itself looked very nice. For the hockey game I bought some pucks for charity. We sat in the upper part of the arena and could still see the game great. I had the luxury of watching my new favorite hockey team play my old favorite hockey team and wore the associated colors and didn't get harassed or feared for my safety at any time (I couldn't say the same if I was at a Flyers or Devils game, which is why I'll never do it).Hopefully it won't take another 20 years for me to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aspiring_Critic
50,Ice hockey experience of a lifetime,"Having never been to an ice hockey game (we are from New Zealand) had the best fun.

30,No Game?,"I went here last year 2015 , also playoffs but was not able to watch the game.. being here is just a wonderful experience since you get to take pictures with the Legends of basketball, hockey and boxing.. in front of Staples Center is the Statue of Kareem Abdul Jabar , Oscar Dela Hoya and Wayne Gretzky..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384davea
30,Pretty Good Sound for Concerts. Great For Sports. They Must Work on Handicapped Parking,"Staples is huge. I wish it was smaller so all of the seats were good, but it is a wonderful venue for a concert or a sporting event. Parking is a pain and if you are disabled it really sucks--good luck if you don't walk well. Inside the venue is great. It is clean and the seats are somewhat comfortable. The sound is pretty good, not great. But compared to other venues I have been at, Staples is pretty good. Around Staples is an area called LA Live. There are wonderful eateries, a few stores and the Microsoft Theater, which is very nice. You can spend an evening just at LA Live. The area is safe and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

Somehow, even with giant lines we got in fairly quickly even with the metal detectors and bag searches. The lines for beer went quickly too and I just really enjoyed this facility- plus there are stellar bars and restaurants an easy walking distance all around it. It was a great experience.

50,A downtown LA Hub,Staples Center is an excellent place to see sports and concerts. It is a family friendly arena with many food options available.

30,Big place,"I'm sure the place is great when it's in full operation. Still, I was at conference of about 10000 people, at least and everyone had to go in search of a place to eat well beyond the confines of the center. We took cabs a lot. Too much, I think. And, what's up with snack machines or soda machines. I mean, what's a girl gotta do to get some snacking food while she listens to back-to-back lectures? I think that really bothered me. Otherwise, great place to hold a big conference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ketsiat
40,Go when there is a game,"I brought my boyfriend here recently when there were no games or concerts scheduled and the whole place was pretty dead. I'm used to the bright flashing lights and crazy crowd that usually gathers there on game nights.There are several nice, affordable restaurants in the area, but parking can be a challenge if you want to spend less than $20-$30.If there are no events going on I'd say skip it. There are much more fun areas/activities is the area.There is a bar at the 21st floor of the Ritz which I highly recommend for a quick cocktail or small snacks to enjoy the view overlooking the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CignoNero

40,Plan to pay the parking meter downtown.,"Parking is a moving target and not regulated. If their is and even plan on at least $20 or more a good walk.

If you just want to look around and eat, find a meter for $1 and hour but 2 is the limit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship

I love to attend basketball games at the Staples center and I always have a great time especially if we sit in the box seats or close to the floor always a plus.

40,Kobe's last game,"Came in town for Kobe's last game. The Staples Center is really nice but the security line to get in was awful. It took over an hour and 20 min to get in the stadium causing us to miss Magic Johnson's speech at the beginning of the game. It was a joke. For the money spent on tickets, it should have been handled better. As for the stadium itself , it was well run as easy to get around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMOO834

You also have Steak Places to eat at like Prime across the Street , though not in LA Live as well . Parking is easy , as their are dozen and dozen of lots within walking distance of Staples Center.

Well worth going to Staples for an Event .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3115XVstevenl

Besides, it is a great venue to enjoy a show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
40,Amazing experience,Attended the last LA Lakers game of the year and had an awesome time in their Premier Seating section - well worth the tickets for the view and food alone. Service was exceptional and the food was okay priced for such a venue. The souvenir store was completely packed but generally well run. Queues into the venue could be handled much better as it was a bit confusing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guac_and_roll
50,Fantastic arena,Having seen the NY Rangers play the last time I was in NYC I was delighted to see that our visit to LA coincided with the NY Rangers playing the LA Kings at the Staples Centre. My second experience of NHL was just as good as the first and a lot of that was down to the Staples Centre. Even the nose bleed seats have a great view and the arena was very well maintained. The game itself was a tight affair and it went to overtime before the Kings took the victory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonny_k86
50,Awesome Venue,"We had a full day layover in LA, so being the good Canadians we are, decided to catch the LA Kings vs. Dallas Stars game. Other than the traffic infested drive to the arena, our experience was amazing. We like travelling to different venues for ice hockey whenever we travel. The Staples center and surrounding are is similiar to Columbus, Nashville and what Detroit is planning for their new arena. Creating a district around your arena is a great idea. Inside the venue, there were many good options for food and drink. The seats were comfortable and sight lines awesome. I don't think anyone would have a bad seat here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetboyb747
10,Disgraceful attitude towards less-abled by a member of staff.,"I've chosen terrible in the hope a member of the Staples Center see's this.The overall experience for a Lakers game is very good but 1 member of staff really was out of order and this should be addressed - plus the Staples center lack of disabled access which is quite shocking.We arrived on March 30th for 1 of Kobe's last games having come from England to ensure we saw him before he retires.Amoungst the group were 3 registered disabled. We asked at one entrance where there disabled access was but were told to ask nearer out ""stand"" which was around the other side of the arena. When we got to that side the person said there isn't any. I explained the situation and he said he couldn't help and that none of the party is in a wheelchair.I found this comment to be rather distasteful and not acceptable. Disability isn't confined to a wheelchair user and comes in many other forms shapes and sizes. I was very incensed by this and really stressed the urgency in the situation and more about the disabilities amoungst the group. He wasn't happy but said he would ask his manager.He came back to say its OK and to wait here for these people to go through then he would let us in so I called over the group. At this point he then announced to the people we were moving ahead of that we have disabled people in the group hence him allowing us in. Again I felt this was a shocking thing to say he had no need or right to announced infront of our group that we had disabled people. We received some very nasty looks from those people and I told him that he had no right no announce that.Additionally we then asked if the young 6 yr old autistic child in our group could walk down the seating isles to be at the bottom (just above courtside) for a picture. The staff at the isle's said no but to ask guest relations (other side of arena) said no but to ask the Lakers people (other side of arena). The Lakers people said no but to ask guest relations (other side of the arena) at this point having walked the youngster back and forward along with the other less abled in our group we decided to give up. It was such ashame because at 6yrs old and autistic he doesn't understand why he was unable to do that.I urge the Staples Center to review their disabled access facilities and train their staff on what is acceptable in terms of language to use. Also it would be great if you showed more empathy and understanding.A great game v Miami though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/743nadeemb
50,Excellent Arena But Beware Of Timeshare Raffle Scam At End Of Escalator,"Staples Center is gorgeous, clean, larger than life, thrilling, and while a splurge it's an affordable luxury for families, great place for singles to meet, fun mixing spot. However, and I regret to use my time on Tripadvisor to write out this warning.... BUT!If you have a third level ticket and need to take escalators UP UP UP, at the very top of the escalators there is a man dressed in black, looking like a blonde and tired Gary Numan. Do not talk to Miss Thing there because he's going to LIE to you. He will pretend to be a Staples Center usher who needs to look at your ticket and direct you where to go, but he is not interested at all. He's not even looked at your seat section but he will hand you a gold raffle ticket and point you to a wall of touch screen computers to ""enter to win a VIP upgrade to today's event"" -- we were miserable in the nosebleed section as the tickets were sold out but for the nosebleed seats, and my kid took the bait. Before I knew it, as I was talking to Gary Numan Miss Thing in tired suit, my kid was already at the computer screens entering in our phone number and email address.Wonder why you ever get a dozen calls a day from telemarketers?When I realized this was a TIMESHARE scam and that no way was there ever going to be a VIP upgrade but data collecting to resell to third party telemarketers, I asked Gary Numan Miss Thing to please remove our data from the computer and he got all prissy huffy freaked out, telling me ""too late, now go away,"" so this obliged me to warn everyone coming off escalator and entering entryway where the fake ushers are......Once more the fake usher would hand out a gold raffle ticket and redirect fifty dollar seat guests to enter cell phone number to get called in case the free VIP upgrade was won. I said one word to the person taking the raffle: ""TIMESHARE"" and each person passed the raffle ticket back to the false usher....And well, after about ten of these failed attempts for him to swindle good people's personal information for exploitation, the guy just turned into a hissy fitted primadonna and why he was renamed ""Gary Numan Miss Thing In A Tired Men In Black Suit"" --Yes, I know, not a nice thing to say, but he has earned it for deceiving thousands and thousands and thousands of innocent people are lied to about this stupid free VIP upgrade win that does not exist nor ever will. And this was confirmed to me by the staff of AEG. I spoke with three of them Charlie's Angeles en masse when they were observing the interaction between me and GNMTINAMIBS, and I later had a discussion with them near my section, when, to my surprise.... they sent their boss, Omar Castro, who came to my seat to ask if I could speak with him out in the hall....I worried for a second about being evicted for trying to stop the Timeshare data collecting goings on.... Mr Castro said that he was not pleased to hear what happened and so hoped to actually upgrade our seats to VIP but as it's playoffs none were available so he had a couple of care packages to share with my family. I was very touched, and it helped me feel good about Staples again. But I told Mr Castro that while my family does accept the gifts it's not in trade of buying silence about the Timeshare business... He said he understood and will look into not letting that kind of deception continue further.So just to be clear........... DON'T ENTER INTO ANY RAFFLE AT STAPLES BECAUSE IT'S A TIMESHARE SCAM!!! Just be happy with your seat as it is at Staples because for what it's worth, the building is designed so well that every seat is a great seat whether third row nosebleed or VIP. I've sat VIP plenty and this nosebleed front row was a first, and it did not bother me.... just the idea of it did, but in reality the seats are all good.Also, compliments to Karen in food service hot dog stand (around section 329) and the Tostitos cart lady Martha for being kind to remake nachos that had too many crumbly chips. All nice staff at Staples.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MotherTravels

10,"Clippers Game - Racism, Ignorance Incompetence","I purchased 2 tickets to the first clippers playoff game on April 17th. I arrived at the game shortly after halftime and was told that I need to physically have my tickets printed because the box office was closed. After spending most of the 3rd quarter finding a local hotel to print my tickets, I was finally allowed into the arena.Once I tried to go to my seats, two other patrons in the seats next to me (sec 104 row 6 seats 1 and 2) demanded to see my tickets and refused to let me walk past them to my seats. There was only one way to enter the seats in the row of four chairs. The patrons stated that ""people like me"" are always trying to move down at half time for better seats. He made several demands for my tickets, stated that those seats are his two and we cant sit there. He refused to move and I was physically prevented from sitting down. Another group of jerks joined in on the harrassment, one man even standing up to fight my boyfriend. This group of inebriated men continued to argue with us until I called security to resolve the issue. Then Staples Center Security made my boyfriend get up to speak with them outside of the main arena and away from the game for 15 minutes. We were eventually permitted to watch the the final 2 minutes of the game. Not only did the fans next to us prevent us from watching the game, they also confiscated the promotional t-shirts and wriststbands that were on the seats. (Which they eventually attempted to return). We were there to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the entire experience was ruined. Moreover, I was prevented from watching a game that I paid over $400 for tickets for. Security allowed the unruly patrons to stay in the game and didn't even acknowledge that the patrons threatened us with physical violence and stood up to fight me and my lady. I am appalled by the treatment I received at this arena. There were no apologies from the staples center staff. They did however ask us if we wanted to be relocated to ""different seats"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neefp
50,A great place to watch Sports and Concert events,I frequent staples center mostly on Lakers games and It's all great! One thing I don't like is the long line to use the restroom during event breaks so use the restroom during the event's performance. I highly recommend going to this place at least 2 hours before the event due to easy parking and I usually park right on staples center's owned parking lots and it's cheap. The private parking lots around staples center are more expensive and I've seen them charge $60 for a parking space for a bigger event. There are some cheaper parking space $10 to $15 and that's If you don't mind walking 2 blocks away from staples center. Thanks for the memories KOBE... GO LAKERS!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe_TrekkerXXX
50,Basketball & Ice Hockey,"This is a well set out stadium with great views no matter where you sit!

40,"Very good, not great, facility.","I am a long-time season seat holder to the Los Angeles Kings (back to the Old Forum days). So, I have been to this facility several hundred times. I will review as it relates to hockey primarily.First of all, unlike facilities for the Coyotes, the Ducks, and the Sharks; this is a general purpose facility- it is a bit larger than those three. I've sat in a lot of different areas in this arena for hockey and unless you are in the lower bowl, you will be further away from the ice than in those venues.The eats are a definite upgrade from the Forum. Prices are a bit steeper compared to the other arenas I mentioned. I recommend that you eat somewhere else if you can just b/c of that. However, the quality of the food is fine, and there are plenty of choices there to select from.The ""sit down"" type restaurants though at Staples are only available to the club box patrons. However, these is new bar/eatery there on the ground level which I have not gone to.Men's bathrooms are a problem. Always a big line in between periods.Parking is not cheap, but you are in downtown L.A. Good luck with that.The facility should not distract from your enjoyment of the event. The Staples staff is courteous and the ushers are responsive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJBrew
50,Fantastic Experience,Had never been to an American sport event only ever watched it from the comfort of my home buy always wanted to be there. Well what a night the atmosphere before the game the build up around the stadium was superb lots of places to choose to have a beer Toms was brilliant. It gets to game time and the atmosphere inside was electric the Americans know how to get a crowd going would go again I would go tomorrow if the Mrs would let me. A must if you can get tickets!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166darrens
40,Loved watching the LA Lakers here!,"My friends and I came over from the Uk for a holiday and bought the cheap tickets to see an LA Lakers game at the Staples centre.We expected to be so high up we wouldn't be able to see clearly, but the way the stadium is laid out you can still see, even from right up the top.There was a great atmosphere, plenty of restrooms & food stalls, and even an outdoor bar area.Even though the centre holds 20,000 people it didn't take too long to get in before the game, or out afterwards.Had a brilliant time - and the Lakers won to make it even better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/475claireb

I chose to just not eat rather than have overpriced nachos or hot dogs. They really shoud provide better options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariabQ1156DD

Good security on the front gate, a range of catering options for all budgets including a range of craft beers.Clean and well maintained concourse areas and once inside the seats (upper level) had a good view of the court action given the height.I think venues back home here in the UK could learn a thing or two from Staples Centre when it comes to all round experience and hospitality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbh73

When we booked the tickets we new we'd be up high, so we were expecting the action to be far away...but surprisingly it didn't feel like that at all. We had a great view & watched the game on the ice rather than having to watch it all on the screen.The bathroom line was really quick between periods, which was also a pleasant surprise. Also, they were very clean & well stocked.We would LOVE to come back & see another game of hockey or even the Lakers!!Cannot recommend going here enough to experience a game, great family fun & fantastic entertainment.

In the past they would just quickly look in it and then hand it back to me. I guess the security guy was just doing his job but I still don't like anybody rummaging through my handbag.I have sat in different sections and I can definitely say I do not like the upper level concourse 300's, I prefer the 200's sections.Restrooms are clean and I don't think I've ever had to wait in a line as there are plenty of stalls. There are also many places to buy a beer or a cocktail, and you'll see lines but it is never long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvgrl2014
50,Great venue!,"This place is big. But if you want to see the big music acts that are touring, they are probably playing here. Food is ok. They have nice bars in a few locations. I really just go there because some rock band is playing. Bring at least $20 or more for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/566KarenP
50,Loved our NHL match!,We managed to book tickets through Stubhub to see an NHL match during our stay in LA and it was fantastic! The game was thoroughly enjoyable and we had great seats too! Would love to come back for a basketball game on our next visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottew278
40,"Nice arena, convenient food & shopping, Kings fans from hell.","I've attended quite a few hockey games. Even though I am not a Kings fan, I appreciate the level of skill this team brings. The game March 17 against the NY Rangers was fantastic, the security lines were moving quickly, the ticket scan was a breeze. We got an Uber to drop us off at the curb, it was perfect.As soon as we got in the arena we noticed a lack of staffing at the sections . We struggled,to find our seats only to be turned around and rerouted three times.The Kings fans were immediately confrontational, belligerent, and rude .I was embarrassed for the families that sat @ this idiot.Even after the game while walking back to the hotel we were alarmed at the classlessness of some of these supporters, great team, low life fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Penfanz
50,Kings vs Habs at LA Live!,"Friends invited us to their private box when the Kings took on the Montréal Canadiens in March. Although the habs lost, we still had a great time in this first class facility.Great sight lines, expansive common areas with wide circulation paths, clean and safe environment.Food concessions were better than average for this kind of venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean_MarcR183
20,Not a bad venue just a bad part of town,Not a great place to be at nightime. This is a good venue but we just felt unsafe and hurried to get out of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Food_Travel_Ron
50,LA kings!,"Had a great night here watching the LA kings!Parking was incredibly easy to find and relatively cheap.There are a huge range of options of places to eat both inside and outside the staples center. The seating is also good, you can have an awesome view from pretty much anywhere in this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/becsyfoster
40,Friendly staff - Not what you would normally expect at a venue like this.,I love the location of Staples Center. The center is surrounded by excellent restaurants and top notch hotels. In the Winter they even set up an ice skating ring!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S541GIsarahr
50,Fun +energy.,A bustling area is filled with tourists from all over the world. Staples center is such a magnet with its grandiose architecture and energy. LA Live will cap off a visit day or night. Restaurants free shows and a good time is guaranteed. Walk about safely and enjoy our city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/427harryc
50,Opening Night for Clippers. Awesome Night,"Went on Home Opening Night of the NBA season, Clippers were playing Dallas. The crowd was great and the Clips put on a really good show. Was a pretty one sided game with Dallas having a couple of key guys out.Will definitely try and get to another game next i am over in the States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550nickd
50,Lakers vs. Golden State Warriors March 6th 2016,"I've always wanted to be there and finally I've managed. Bought the tickets 6 months earlier, had breakfast @ Pantry Caffè and we were all set. Easy to access via car with my family. The Staples opens 1h before the match, take your time to get some pictures of the Lakers legends at the main entrance. The show was amazing even though we had tickets in the last rows on top. It is a must go attraction! btw Lakers won and we got free tacos as well :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SebastianoM936
40,"Small Seats, but it's an arena...","Caught a Clippers game last Friday night. Great venue. We had nosebleed seats, but mid court for a pretty decent view. Seats were Donnelly pretty tight, but I guess this is to be expected. Lots of food and drink. Staff friendly. Look forward to taking up another game here, with better seats. No comments on parking as we took the Metro in amd walked over 2 city blocks, which was pretty easy to navigate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOneiricTraveler
50,What a great stadium,"Was lucky enough to see a game during a business trip this month. We booked tickets late and were in the nose bleed section, to my surprise the view of the action was excellent for a stadium this size. Food and drinks are well priced and the atmosphere is awesome. Would recommend to anyone on any budget as the cheapest seats are still excellent.Well done",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNMO1978
40,Nice place to see a game if you can afford it,"We saw a Clippers game here. The arena was well designed with good sight lines. We had premier seats -- great but expensive. These seats were worth the money if you can afford it, but it seemed Ike a big splurge. In fact, all decent seats seem pretty pricy. The scoreboard is well designed. The light show with the introductions was awesome. The music and PA announcer were not great. But there were fun distractions during breaks in the action. The team store was a bit of a letdown. Concessions were better than expected. Great fries. I am not a huge fan of the Times Square vibe going on outside around the arena. And would it kill someone to put up some signs around the arena to direct visitors to the right places? It took a full 30 minutes to find Deck C so we could use out parking pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMasterJ

50,Awesome Lakers Game,We went to Lakers Game to see Kobe's final play. However he had shoulder injury and didn't play. But the young players did and amazing play including Russell dropping 39 points braking his own record. No one left till the last seconds. Great Game! Attendance were all excited but nice and friendly. Everyone had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crestwood2014

50,Another fantastci evening,"The Staples Center again laid on a very good show for the Montreal Canadiens visit to the Los Anegeles Kings. Friendly staff, great on ice entertainment and a classy anthem singer who actually sung the Canadian anthem in French. The only disappointment was the fact that the Kings won the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reservarlden

Its a really good place to watch events,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966zacb
50,Fantastic!!!,Well I think that you can not go to LA without going to staples center. It is perfect for a weekend night to enjoy a good game with your family or with your love. You have many option to eat and drink. The games are always entertaining with the staff in middle of the games. And when the game is over you should go to the bars around. You will enjoy the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackyazamas
50,BEST NHL EXPERIENCE,"Outstanding venue for sports. Went to the King's game. Loved the whole experience. LA LIVE across the street. Parking is in and out. A little pricey and remember where you parked. Great seats, new seats are much more comfortable. Clean, family friendly, great place for a game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonaldM876
50,NBA Game,"I Had a great night with my friends, we went to watch the Clippers vs Kings fun atmosphere and nice venue. Very organised just wish it was the Lakers as part of Kobes last season!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faz1045
20,Overall a fairly poor experience for a NBA game,While the game was good to watch the overall experience is lacking. Despite being a relatively par game LAC vs MIN the facilities were really overrun with people. Food was expensive and terrible.A side note that we only had our Australian drivers licenses with us and they refused to serve us drinks without passports. This was the only place in the USA that did this to us. We tried multiple shops and got turned around at all of them even though we were nearly 30.Atmosphere was nothing compare to other stadiums I have been too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Pones

40,Big - but somehow intimate,"I saw the Lakers play there and was there another time for a convention. Had nice seats for the Lakers, it's a nice center, clean, good staff and like all event centers the food and drinks are a bit pricey..so bring some money and have fun - But don't drink to much, this is the only thing concerned me - the building is CIRCULAR with small entrances - and you may not find your way back to your seat...LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronb753

50,The Staples Center is the place to be!,The Staples Center is really becoming the place to be in downtown Los Angeles. With LA Live right next door and lots of other activities going on you could spend a whole day in the area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QDOGG8
50,Home to LA LAKERS - LA KINGS -LA CLIPPERS excitement non-stop!,Perfect venue for all major sporting and concerts in L.A. Convenient parking - Nokia live offers ample food options. Good security,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596erike
50,Amazing venue and great atmosphere,Watched 2 games at Staples Center during my stay: Spurs vs. Clippers and Spurs vs. Lakers. The Lakers game felt more festive and the crowd more raucous. There is certainly an element of history when the Lakers play. Clippers fans are more reserved and not as passionate about their team. Plenty of entertainment and food inside and outside the arena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranzA848
50,LA KINGS,"My aunt had got my siblings and I premium seating to go see the LA Kings take on the Ottawa Senators (sadly, we lost ;-; ) But it was a wonderful experience, the seating was great the whole stadium was beautiful and I found myself taking dozens of pictures with my siblings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theoneonlyme

50,STAPLES Center is worth seeing!,"Was able to attend a Clippers game while in LA. The stadium is beautiful and in the center of downtown giving you plenty to do before and after the game! We stopped and had drinks before the game, which is a good idea if you are trying to save a buck, otherwise there are plenty of bars to grab a beer or cocktail. The arena itself is magnificent, and the seats were good too. Would come for a concert or another NBA game in the future>",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcPuma
50,Only the best venue for all sporting and music events,I've been coming here for years attending Laker games and have been to the grammy's once. My friends and I have always had loads of fun here and you will too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daleo170
50,Lakers at the Staples Center,Very impressive. Found valet parking right across the street. Tons of restaurants to walk to. Just being down there was exciting! Lots of good energy from the Lakers fans. The neon lights create a lot of excitement and you will be glad you experienced it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bartosortiz
40,"Great venue for games, next to DTLA","Great venue for basketball and hockey games. Concerts and shows are also hosted here, but the upper seats aren't as attractive for these kinds of events. Parking is available in the nearby lots, but it can be expensive, so metro or other public transporation is recommended. There are a few restaurants to the north in the LA Live complex, and the rest of downtown is further north, down Figueroa. For drinks, you may want to consider pregaming off site, unless you are OK with paying higher prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tute66
40,Iconic is iconic,"I have been a Lakers season ticket holder for more than 35 years, and a Kings season ticket holder for a significant portion of that time. Actually I much preferred the access and egress, the sight lines and the seats at the Forum, which was the Lakers' and Kings former home. But like Madison Square Garden, MetLife Stadium and Centre Bell the history and ethos survive their teams' transitions to newer homes, and if you love sports you gotta visit Staples. The banners are there, the knowledge and love of the teams are there (even when they have fallen on hard times as have the post-Jerry Buss Lakers), the pageantry is there, and all the playoffs and championships you remember, even if some of them were played elsewhere, are in the air. And, in LA, so are the stars who come out regardless of the team's fortunes. If you are a fan you will remember seeing a game there, and--notwithstanding the high prices, so/so food, the less than comfortable seats and the variability of the performances--it will be a special experience. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethA435
40,Great if you have a reason to be there,"The Staples Center is a sports arena. There is nothing really exciting about it, but if you have a reason to be here, (Kings, Lakers or Clippers game, or a concert) then it is fine. Otherwise there is no reason to be here at all. In and of itself it is not a tourist attraction.As with most similar venues, food is extremely expensive, so if you are going to an event there and are on a tight budget, I suggest eating beforehand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyS110
50,Go Kings!,Took my best friend to his first NHL game and sat in premier seating. What a blast! We ate inside the arena and thought everything was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721RobertC
40,Here for Lakers Game,"Went here to catch the Lakers. Easy to get to and surprisingly parking wasn't bad. Ticket prices are ticket prices, but I got decent seats which actually had wait service so I didn't have to wait on line. Would go to again to see Lakers or Clippers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomg344
40,Good for NBA,Went to see lakers v Bulls. The stadium itself is pretty neat. It is very high up due to three levels of corporate boxes(?). So I dont know if the view on the highest level would be good. We were seated in the 200's section in one of areas on the corner of the court and the views were pretty good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872jessiez
50,Quite an experience!,"I visited the place on several occasions for Basket Ball matches and hockey games.The venue is great, the ambiance is always energetic.You are coming to a sport venue / arena, so do not expect to fin good food within, but you can always cross the road for a proper meal before the events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaetan2013

40,The downtown fun,"It was fabulous area, memorable for the tourists.Taking the pictures there were attractive.Different kinds of famous companies' studios.ButFar away car parking.Insufficient food markets and restaurants there especially for kids meals.

50,Awesome venue,"WOW! Came from New Hampshire for vacation and decided to check out a Laker's Game. Got there a bit early as we didn't know how to judge the traffic. Ended up parking a couple blocks up for $20. We go into the arena and were impressed. We have been to lots of venues like this, and this one is one of the nicest. The seats are super comfortable and the entire inside is beautiful.Drinks are super expensive but that is no different than any other venue! I would love to come back if I was in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfedele85
30,Great venue for standing in line,"We went on January 31 for a sold-out Laker game. About 19,000 in attendance. We had very good seats (near mid-court, about 20 rows up) and valet parking from a friend. And Kobe was the high scorer in yet another Laker loss this season.That's the good side. Well, not the Laker loss.Valet parking. Easy in, and only one car ahead of us. But that car did not have valet parking and that led to a 7 minute discussion with the driver to get her to turn around and find the correct lot. I don't know how much our friends pay for valet parking, but if you want valet parking and you show up without a pass it is $200. Yep. $200. On the other hand, leaving after the game was seamless.On getting in. Well, the Lakers ticket office apparently failed to tell security they had sold out, all 19,000 seats, so not every door was staffed. Yep. Some doors were locked. So we stood in line. Mind you, that is for tickets which had a nominal value of $269 each, for the four of us. And we got sent to the wrong door by a security person who sent a bunch of people around us to different doors. Once we were up to the metal detector, the staff went through my wife's purse for over a minute searching for whatever. (They missed the sealed water bottle in her jacket.) Time trying to get in: 27 minutes on the clock.Once inside and at our seats, there was a constant stream of people coming down the stairs blocking our view of one side of the Court. Ordinarily, Staples is usually good about holding folks back until there is a break in play, but the usher on our aisle told me that they had been instructed, because of the long lines to get in, not to enforce that rule in the first quarter.We never bought snacks because the lines were far too long.The face value of the tickets and parking must approach $1100. For a game that is on TV. There is some excitement in being there, especially for cheering for Kobe. But that's not $1100 worth of entertainment.On the plus side, bathrooms never had a line. They were not terribly clean, but staff was there trying to keep up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalTraveler91356
50,LAL vs CHI,"Plan to arrive 2 hours early before game time, to find parking, price range is from $6-30. construction is going on, so where parking use to be something is being built there. a few eatery's in Nokia Plaza, Staple center is a beautiful place, LA Store is open during game times & off game( and can only go inside with paid ticket.) the same trips back here never get old! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeandraM_13
50,"Beautiful, Clean and for everyone","I came here for a Laker game. I was so impressed with the how clean the facility is and the food options they have inside. If you're going to an event at the Staples Center, I recommend you eat in there. Restaurants surrounding the building are overpriced. I made the mistake of going to a Mexican restaurant nearby thinking inside the Staples Center was going to be more expensive. I was wrong AND there was Mexican food in there. It is beautiful exploring the surrounding areas of the Staples Center during the holidays, so many lights, the music, tree and skating rink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianamP6140CZ
50,Awesome Venue,"I have been here on many occasions for sporting events and concerts. The place is simply spectacular. This is where the Lakers and the Kings play, folks! Anyway, I have never actually parked in their parking lot though I know it exists. I always park in the other parking lots including the large structure by the Nokia Center as well as the smaller private lots. Costs will run you between $15.00 to $30.00, which is not bad. My favorite thing about Staple Center is that there are freeways all around the stadium so it is pretty easy to get on the freeway on your way home. I hate the Rose Bowl for this exact reason. It takes you 30+ minutes just to get to the freeway after a game.I have also watched numerous games from the suite. If you have never tried, please do. It is a pretty cool experience. The dessert cart is awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jt99941
50,Wonderful Event Center,We have seen several sports events at this center. We have been to several basketball games as well as hockey. This is a beautifully designed and well maintained center. The bathrooms are plentiful and always easy to find and kept clean. We love the special areas that they have to eat and drink. Lots available for any taste of food that you might have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Always5Star
50,Just my opinion from the outside ! Good overall,"I visited the staples center at night. However, we just saw it from the outside and its surroundings. There was a game at the time so it was full. It seems like a good place for games and its surroundings are very clean. Tons of restaurants. If you are not going for a game, then I recommend you go somewhere else. Not much to do other than watching a game inside. The bars and restaurants around are kind of expensive and you can get the same things for a cheaper price at other places. Parking is ridiculous and too expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaTrias
50,LA Lakers v Houston Rockets,"Well worth a visit just to see and feel the whole basketball experience. Security is tight (good) with airport style entry search regime. The food and drink inside puts British sports stadia to shame and the whole vibe is friendly, despite some away fans trying to wind up the locals. In between the basketball there's a ton of entertainment to keep everyone amused. A great night out for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47
40,Nice Arena,"Not my favorite NBA venue, but it is a nice facility. Team store was picked over and the lines to pay were really long. Had lounge access before game which was really nice. Good people watching obviously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meflatow
50,Great venue to watch an Ice Hockey game!,Took the family to see our first Ice Hockey game. The fun started before we even stepped into the centre. Lots of entertainment outside to entertain you before going in. Once inside there were plenty of food options and the staff were very helpful when we were trying to navigate where we were going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115cathyh
50,Great venue!,The food in the restaurant is great! The premier level provides in-seat food service. The suites provide wonderful service. You must buy something off of the dessert cart. I've also sat in the 300 level and it's still a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Truevoice

We did not do so and spent a crazy amount of money at concessions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKoreenRS37
40,Great venue,"We went to watch a basketball game here during our visit to Los Angeles.As with most sports venues the lower the price the further you are from the action.Our seats were US$70 and located on one of the highest seating levels. While it was possible to see all the action, it was next to impossible to make out the actual players.If you have a fear of heights you'll need to pay a lot more and sit lower down, because the levels slope up quite severely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnpsau

Sat at centre ice about half way up . Great sight lines . Loved the passion of the Kings fans , very knowledgeable and loyal fan base . Staff was friendly and helpful , crowd was friendly even when thousands were doing the ""Leafs Suck "" chant .lol . Being a smoker I enjoyed going out to the smoking area without having to leave the arena . bar , BBQ food and heaters located there . A lot of people seeing our Jerseys came over for some good natured banter . One of the best nights out we've had at any hockey venue . Will definitely return .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmyd1
30,"Not for the ""little"" people","Staples Center is good for sporting events but as expected acoustics are not great for concerts. If you are sitting in lower levels the experience is better. With its multi-layers of suites, it leaves the average fan up higher than expected so you have to look down on the scoreboard in the center. The suites have special entrances and exclusive food and drink options that others do not have but they make you pass by and see it on your way to the rafters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slash45
50,Bucket list check,"As a Lakers fan for almost 20 years, I finally made my 1st visit to Staples Center. I flew in from DC and stayed at the downtown Sheraton, which was a short walk to the arena. To see Staples Center lit up at night w/ the historic statues of Magic and Kareem outside, with fans filing in it, it was a great moment for me. I sat center court about 12 rows up, and got a great look at all of the championship banners that we have amassed over the years. Great great feeling!! Although we're rebuilding and we didn't win the game, it was just great being on our home court for the 1st time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wvhofdc
40,Staples yes!,"So we had our one annual set of tickets for the Clipper game last weekend. We go every year along with a Laker attempt just to get in an outing to something other than baseball. Staples was its usual splendid self with good sight lines from our seats but too hyperactive a sound system and overly chirpy crowd motivators who chatter endlessly when the game is at idle. The neighborhood takeaway this time was finding a nice, cheap parking location near Hooters that was half the cost of the three others surrounding it. The L.A. Live offerings around Staples make it well worth an early arrival to allow time to enjoy a micro-brew or dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306bobh
40,Go Early,Great venue. Go early the lines are long to get inside. Great food options. And be sure to get some photos with statues out front with past Laker a Greats.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stunning1
40,Wonderful night at the staples centre,"We went as a family to see the LA Lakers play. Easy to find although parking proved expensive close to the stadium, however it was worth it to be close to the venue. The stadium is impressive, we had seats about as high up as you can get and the view was still ok. Great atmosphere and well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizmomo
30,Went for a Kings game,"It was a nice arena. Clean, friendly staff. Good variety of food choices on the lower level. They have a McDonalds and Wetzels Pretzels. The food choices on the upper level are limited. No vendors in the stands. In the upper deck the seats are more straight up, not slanted. They have a very nice scoreboard. The sound was at a good level. Overall, a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savedbyhim2
50,Must visit,"I had the privilege of attending a Lakers game here and it was a dream come true! What a stadium, what an atmosphere, what a crowd! If you are a true blue sports fan then this has to be one of the MUST DO things in LA.

Hard to beat.From the easy access from the 110, to the food, concessions, seating and overall asthetic, this is a great arena to see a game. In a season where I have been to the Canucks in Vancouver, the Flames in Calgary and the Oilers at Rexall, as someone who lives in LA, I am proud we have the Staples Centre.My next game will be the Leafs at Kings.Go Leafs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HutchinLA

40,Good venue but park and pre-load elsewhere downtown,"Went to two different types of event at the Staples Center whilst on holiday in Los Angeles – an ice hockey game and a rock concert. The venue is generally very good, although both the parking ($30) and the food/drinks are extortionate ($12 for a beer).In order to avoid overpaying, best thing to do is to park in one of the open-air car parking lots downtown and walk over to the Center – perfectly safe. It only takes about 10 minutes and costs around $5. For example, we ended up using the Athena Parking Lot on Grand/9th St quite a bit...it was a useful location for several points of interest downtown.There are a few bars en route as well, including BottleRock wine bar on W 11th St.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gulya_ldn

30,Your average arena,"Went to the Staples Center for UFC 184. Overall a decent experience and nothing to really differentiate this arena from any other one. I would suggest though when leaving or before entering the arena head directly across from it because there at LA Live is a gang of restaurants, museums, bars and plenty of other sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigRu510
50,The heart of the Lakerland!,"Incredible experience. Saw Kobe Bryant last December 23, 2015 in their game against Oklahoma City Thunder. Though they lost by more than 30 points, it was a dream come true for me!!!

40,Show time...,"Went to Staples Center to watch a Clippers game.Centrally located you can access from many different roads. Lots of parking available, especially if you get there an hour earlier than game start. Prices range from 8 to 15 Usd.There are plenty of descent restaurants around Staples Center but most close by 10.30 pm so options are limited after a night game.The Center is easily accessible, entering works smooth despite the security checks. As soon as you enter the booths, shops and rest rooms are very close.The usual Hot dog with a soft drink will cost you 15 Usd.Team boutique stay open after the game for about an hour so it is advisable to shop after or during the game , not during halftime.Overall a must see experience once in LA....Clippers or Lakers for basketball, but there is also Ice Hockey to see in Staples center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grbr07
50,Experience of a lifetime,"We attended to a Lakers game (preseason) but we were able to get almost courtside seats. It´s incredible to be near the players!

50,Concert Experience at the Staples Center,"Attended a concert at Staples Center on December 19, 2015. If you have VIP access, there are 2 covered VIP entrances (nice on this date because it was cold and raining. The general admission line was not under any kind of cover). Since we had VIP tickets, we saw more of the venue including the lounge area where food was provided. The food was catered by the Staples Center and was OK - keep warm with Sterno cans and heat lamps (sliders, nachos, chicken strips). The restrooms were adequate for the volume of people attending. It was a sold out show and we never had to wait in line for the restrooms. Seating was comfortable enough for a stadium. This tour used a 360 stage set up, and other venues had delays or cancellations due to difficulty setting up with the equipment in place in the venue (jumbo-tron, etc.), but the Staples Center was able to set up and the shows (Dec 18 & 19) opened on time. The only issue of note was that the floors in the riser sections were not cleaned from the night before and were extremely sticky. I cannot speak to parking because we stayed within walking distance. For those walking, there were plenty of security and police in the immediate area when the show let out to ensure safety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818BB
50,NBA experience at the Staples,First NBA experience. Clippers vs Pacers. Enjoyable atmosphere. Easy access to stadium by transport; then smooth access into the stadium.

20,Not my favorite venue.,I have to admit from my first visit until the present I have not really liked the Staples Center. I have attended many Clipper's games and concerts there. The first time I went there I sat down and every time someone in the row sat down I could feel my seat shake. Somehow the seats were connected and it was annoying. Even in the good seats there is really not much room. It just doesn't feel like a very high class venue.Also the bathrooms are pretty disgusting.The food is passable but like any arena overpriced. Of course you have to go to Staples because that's where the teams play. Don't sit in the really cheap seats. You're better off watching the game on TV unless you're only going for the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
50,Clippers v OKC,"What an absolutely epic experience. The game was fantastic, there is no way myself and my partner could have asked for a better spectacle. The shop had 30% which was neat.

50,"Great center, even better melt down","I was lucky enough to be in this beautiful building the night the unwatchable clippers choked to the rockets. The arena (which is beautiful) played the roll of quite and solum perfectly and allowed a beautiful and colourful precession of band wagon supporters to file out, head down and tail between their legs!

40,Great sports venue,This arena is nice and newer. The concessions are standard fare. The views are good from below. There is an exclusive club where you can eat and drink. The food in the club is buffet style and tends to be over cooked and over salted.There is a lot of game time action and never a quiet moment during clippers games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2traveldaworld
40,Worth a visit,One should not miss seeing this place specially to sports lover....you'll have the chance to see the statue of your fav sports hero who made history....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriam19_2013
50,Basketball Heaven,"This was a major bucket list item for us, and it didn't disappoint. We went to see the Lakers play the Bulls in what ended up as a game that went to double extra time. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GCsk50
40,Great venue,"Teated ourselves to watch the LA Clippers, stadium is fantastic, my tip would be to buy tickets online 48-24 hours prior to the game. We used Star Hub and secured really good seats at reasonable prices. Clippers tickets are significantly cheaper the Lakers, so if you aren't fused the Clippers Tickets are great value. Atmosphere in the venue is simply fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817PaulS
40,Lakers VS Minnesota Timberwolves,Great loactions only downfall is being a traveller they would not except drivers license as a form as ID so we couldn't drink unless we had our passport. It would have been nice to know before we arrived at the centre so travellers take your passport !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JadeSmithx
50,Wonderful experience!,"Me and my husband has just got back from our trip in LA, we were lucky to catch the first Lakers game in the season. We are both basketball fan, and were really impressed with the Staples Centre, from the facility to the atmosphere. The location is great, and so easy to access. We were lucky to see Kobe, and this is his last season. Overall, this is one of the best venue we have been to, highly recommended, whether you are a fan or not, it is worth coming just for the atmosphere! Awesome!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MPerrylxx
50,Great place,Went to concert I love this place it had so many screens that made you feel comfortable to watch the show. I felt right there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramiahdavis
50,What a venue,"My daughter and I went to Staples to see the Los Angeles Clippers play Phoenix Suns. The venue is great and easily supports the amount of people attending, which was sold out.There are a number of different food stalls ranging from sushi, Mexican and fried chicken. Beer is on tap as well as cans.The atmosphere at a basketball game is just magic. Try and get as close as you can afford to the court. We sat in section 106 and although it was behind the ring you still get a great view. I would rather be there than up in the top section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyWRAdelaide
50,Hoops and hockey!,"Most recent visit to STAPLES was 10/15, but we go at least once a month for sporting events. Great line of sight from any seat, wonderful service when in a suite, good food and beverage options for a sports venue. Great teams!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J145WHkarenw
40,Good set up and plenty of food choices,Been here several times to watch the Lakers. Plenty of food choices when you arrive. Seats from almost any area have a decent view of the court and you can see all the action. Would recommend that you park in one of the $20 lots a few blocks from Staples as the lots right by the Center take forever to get in and out of and are not much cheaper.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougieg703
50,Huge Arena,"This place is big,and it takes more than 19,000 guests.You can find good restaurants and other entertainment around it.Ticket prices isn't that bad,and everybody can enjoy a game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izadjafarij
50,Amazing arena,"Went to see LA Kings x Sharks match. If you are not in downtown LA, save a couple of hours to get there. Parking the car costs ~$20. Entering the arena is easy and quick. Several snack bars inside. Everything well organized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardoq90

40,Basketball,"Leave extra time to get through security. Good atmosphere, you don't realise how big it is until you are inside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussiej36
50,sports,A great sports venue for Basketball or Music performers . Large area with ample seaating for all events,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2678PZmarkh
40,good experiences,At the center during the Special Olympics. Everything I thought it would be .Very near other venues and located in an ideal location downtown. We could walk there from our hotel across the street . There are several hotels in the area . They are all upscale hotels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anna3
50,Fantastic atmosphere - for a Kings fan!,"Had a great time here for the ice hockey. We had close seats and it was spectacular, the atmosphere was electric. It wouldn't be great for anyone supporting the opposition but for a Kings fan or a general sports lover this is an absolute must see. I'm only disappointed I couldn't get to a lakers game too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Essa13
50,Great venue for a game!,"Went to watch the Kings here and the facilities for the public were outstanding. Very hospitable, excellent range of food instead of just hot dos and fries!Came back a couple of days later to buy at shirt whilst checking out a clippers game, and the merchandise had all gone! Apparently they only stock the merchandise of the team playing that night-that's a lot of work!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregNS68
50,Great venue for ANY show!,"I've been to Staples for everything from car shows to concerts and have never been disappointed. SO many ways to get there through mass transit and yet, it's still very accessible for drivers. Just go online to see the many surrounding restaurants and bars to hang out in while the traffic dies down and your stress level will be next to zero!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egtact
50,L A Lakers Basketball,"Our final night in LA before flying home to Germany. We booked Premier Seats for 99$ each to see the Lakers vs Portland Trail Blazers. Having Premier Seats means also in seat service for beverages and snacks. The atmosphere was great, Lakers won the preseason match at the end. It was a great event for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tombe253
50,Walking around,Great place to walk around downtown LA. The staples is perfect to watch a game and also to have a good dinner and drinks. The environment is cool with nice bar and restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romelp856
40,No DSLR cameras and $12us a beer!,"Went to see a preseason NBA game, first thing to note is that apparently according to NBA regs, no cameras with a detachable lens of any length are allowed into the game! We were not aware of this, nothing was said when I booked and paid for the tickets, but we had to check my camera in and collect it after the game.They charge a fortune, Kings ransom, for a beer $12us is a new record for me! The beer was good but this is still an outrageous over charge.Also the ticket site I went to said all the best tickets were sold, but that did not look like the case to me when we got in, so search around and you might find a better ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitchrj1
50,Laker's Eighth Row,The Staples Center is an awesome place for a concert or game. There are tons of restaurants and bars all within walking distance so get there way early to enjoy some of them. The tickets for a Laker's game are pretty expensive but it was for a special occasion so it was worth it. Good place for a concert too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736TimB
20,Its alllllllright!!,"Ahhhh....good ol' Downtown Los Angeles aka DTLA. True it looks live and great on postcards and tourist knick Nacks. Essentially, there is not much to do at staples center, unless there is an event going on. In addition, Staples has a Club called the conga room, which you have to go to there website to see which night suits your interest. Oh and there are resturants with great food and atmosphere, and a movie theater, and a bowling alley, but ba dee, ba dee, ba DEE THAT ALL FOLKS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beezwax400
50,Sports and Entertainment Heaven,"If you visit LA and want to see the Famed Lakers, or LA Clippers , or catch a great concert to see Taylor Swift, and so many others, this is your place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
30,Not a great place to see a concert,Went to a concert here and the acostics aren't very good. We were close to stage but the venue is so caverous that it is hard to understand performances. Floor seat area does not have bathrooms nor food/drinks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtravelover1
40,nice arena,"I have been to the Staples Center many times for hockey games, and I also saw Pink there on her last concert. I have been to several NHL arenas for hockey games, and only have two complaints. The food choice and quality should be a little better, so eat at one of the many restaurants in the area first. Second complaint is the security guards, very rude, would not answer my questions regarding best way to get back to where my car was parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveljo1988
50,My first NHL game,"On 20 November 2014, I was on MY first NHL game. LA King vs. Carolina Huarricanes in Staples Center. It was magnificent! Staples Center is a large, modern arena. Hall was full of fans, noise big, spectacular show. fulfilled my childhood dream - I am on the NHL game! GO, KINGS, GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Optyroc
50,Great venue for sports and concerts,"Of course, two of my favorite sports teams play here so I have to love it. But, it does meet the hype, although I wouldn't keep saying it's the ""sports and entertainment center of the world."" The atmosphere is great with great sound; the championship banners help too. I've been to just two concerts, but thoroughly enjoyed those too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKang1962
50,LA Kings Hockey,"i was only in LA 4 days, watched 2 kings games in 100 level. it was great to experience an NHL opening night game in a different city. a guy in row 5 of section 106 wants Jeff Carter to shoot more. i'll tell his Uncle Wayne when i see him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamn470
40,Enjoyable Venue,"We were in the Los Angeles area during the NBA Western Conference this past year when the San Antonio Spurs were playing the Clippers, so we knew we had to go to one of the games. Booking tickets online was easy through AXS. We had the option of booking parking at the same time, which I seriously considered as this was our first time to the venue and we were unfamiliar with the surrounding area. I am really glad I ended up not booking the parking online, because the surrounding streets were so crowded and they had police at certain intersections making it impossible for us to follow the directions our gps was telling us to use to go to the parking garage. We ended up using a valet which was just about a block from the entrance to the arena.As is common outside of sporting events there are plenty of ticket scalpers and various other people of ill repute outside the venue trying to engage with the attendees. We just ignored them and continued walking with the crowds into the building. There was a significant police presence outside on the streets both when we entered and exited the facility and we never felt unsafe.The staff checking people's tickets and assisting at the landings to direct people to their seating sections were all pleasant. There were a wide variety of food and drink options which were right on par with pricing at other sports venues we have attended. We split a long hot dog as a snack and it was hot and fresh tasting.We had seats in the upper section (nose bleed) but found them to still be quite good and wouldn't hesitate to buy seats in the upper section again. Every seat had a Clipper's WC towel over it as a souvenir for the patrons to wave during the game (if you were a Clippers fan that is). When we were there the half time show featured the entertainer Redfoo. While we are not particularly fans of his, it was interesting seeing a ""known"" performer as half time entertainment as we have been to many NBA games at other venues and have not seen entertainment of that level. We were not sure if having named performers such as this is common place all the time at the Staples Center due to the venue being in LA or if it was due to it being the Western Conference and the venue stepped up the entertainment.Upon exiting the facility we got a bit turned around and had to walk almost around the entire outside of the building to find our way back to our valet area, where we had quite a long wait to get our car. We had a very enjoyable evening. Sadly our team (Spurs!) did not win, but we were very happy to be in LA during the WC and having it work out that our team played the Clippers while we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FL_Sable
40,Good Venue!,"Venue is great! Easy to find your seats, staff is nice. Parking is a little crazy if you want something cheaper, otherwise prepare for $20 parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871ninag
50,Terrific Entertainment Venue,"Terrific arena for basketball and other live events. A big entertainment complex has grown up around this venue, and make it a real convention destination and tourism center. A revitalized downtown surrounds the area, which was until recently quite blighted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
40,Ice hockey venue,"Went to see an Ice hockey game here.. Although only 10 rows from the front, you will need a jumper but was not Freezing inside. Food vendors had really nice food there. Seating is good all round being able to see the game. Also has the big screen in the middle up high so you can see the replays. Good venue with stalls marked out clearly so you can get to your seat easily",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneA63
50,Pre Clip,The ease of access is great there is plenty of parking around the arena. There are tons of food choices outside of the stadium for pre event or post event meals and or drinks. The stadium is very nice. The suite level is one of the best I've seen. They don't allow selfie sticks in the stadium so please leave them in the car to avoid confrontation because it is not posted. Drinks and food in the stadium are average stadium cost. There doesn't seem to be a bad seat from the suite level. A part of the LA live area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess123182
30,Venue is good but could use better organization,"We went here for the Big Bang concert. Pre-concert line-ups for merchandise were super long and then they ran out of items (that were available inside). We were also told by staff to use another entrance that had ""no wait"" when there was actually a huge line. Some general confusion about what line you were supposed to use depending on your ticket. The venue itself was nice. Super comfy seats, good views and sound. Show itself was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodie66
50,Friendly staff and spotless place,"We were there for the BigBang concert. The staff working there are so friendly as opposed to the folks working at stadiums back home. Staples Center was also a lot cleaner than, say, Rogers Arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ermoson
50,great food,variety of off places to eat and see - liked modern feeland constant movement inexpensive and over the top.Casual feel'Mostly greatdisliked constant lights that I could see from my hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/751rosab
40,Staples Center - Big for entertainment,"Staples Center is the place to see big entertainers. We've been to a few concerts there - some from a skybox and some from the general seating. Only problem I see is that they can't seem to control the young adults from standing and blocking your view. I complained to security but they said there wasn't anything that could be done. Best seats would be to pay more so that noone at your level can be in front of you. Other than that, the bathrooms are clean and the food is fairly good for the venue. But if you are in a skybox, definitely try the dessert cart. Awesome treats!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lkstumm
50,Great venue for concerts!,Have been there many times for concerts. Great view of the stage...not toooo big like the Forum! Great chick nachos on 3rd floor!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afleetingmoment
50,Great time,"This was my first time at a professional sports game. I went to watch the Lakers play the Dallas Mavericks in 2013. Even though I was a Mavs fan at the time, the home team blew them out. Nevertheless, the crowd was ecstatic and there was strong camaraderie amongst them. The staff even gave away Shaq jerseys (his jersey was retired during halftime), which was a very nice surprise. They also gave away Panini Kobe Bryant collector's cards. The price of tickets is above average compared to the national average, but with an overall positive experience than exceeded expectations, I'd definitely go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unagiroll
40,The LA Clippers won!!,"Went up to watch my first ever NBA game, and it was great. It was easy to get in, easy to find seats and we had a great time!! You should really check this out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SolveigHansine
50,This is it.,"So much has happened here, but the reason I had to go to see this place was because that's where they had Michael Jackson's funeral. It was a sad occasion, I even felt it standing there walking around the building. But it was neat to see. And it was nice to be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelife2015
50,Love Staples!,"I've seen a few concerts here and have always had the time of my life. What makes it great, though, is it's right by a Metro stop so you can easily get here from anywhere you are. We come from the valley, so instead of sitting in traffic... fighting traffic... then paying to park... you can get there and back for like 7 dollars. Totally worth it. Don't eat before you come as there are many affordable options, too! Acoustics are great and it's just a fun place to see a show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philb760
40,Neat arena,"Located downtown LA. Home to many music, theatre and sporting events. It is about a 15 minute walk from USC. There is a multiplex adjoining the center. Also several fancy clubs, bars and restaurants in the area. There is nothing much to see of it unless you hold tickets of a show/event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Priya_T
50,Sports game or concert venue- its a great time either way!,"Been here for Laker games and music concerts. This venue is really in the heart of downtown with so much to do before and after your event. Located close to public transportation, this stadium is easy to get to but is usually surrounded by heavy traffic so be patient and allow some time to get to your destination. There are lots of establishments around that have promotions where you park your car there, have dinner, take the shuttle to the show, then shuttle back to your care. So many options here. The Staples Center is located across from LA Live which is a plaza that has many food options from fancy to fast food. So you can park on site and walk between food and venue in less than 5 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
40,Plenty of Everything,"LA has lucked out with Staples Center—it's no longer the newest arena in the country, but it's still one of the best. Everything is well thought out, inside and out… and the surrounding LA LIVE facilities make it easy and fun to come for a meal and entertainment. You have plenty of dining and parking options, and there's generally a fun vibe around the place.Downtown is coming of age, and Staples Center is a big part of that. It's worth checking out when your favorite artist, team, boxer or *whatever* is playing there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandersMusic
50,Sports and More,"We love to go to Staples to watch hockey games with the Los Angeles Kings and basketball with the Lakers or Clippers.

The tickets were easy to get, the crowd moved fast, the entrance was clear and well define. The sound was absolutely the best and the place was comfortable, having restrooms and drinks available at a very close distance. We were on Floor 3 seats 14,15 and 16 and we were less than 10 meters away from the stage. Excellent place, safe, clean and comfortable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viajeraenfamilia
40,Sports Games and fun times....,"Excellent place to catch a basketball game. I have been to both Laker and Clipper games in addition to Kings Games at Staples. Also been there have been some concerts. A convenient place if you live downtown. Since I live in the San Fernando Valley, it takes a lot of time with traffic on the 101 Freeway and the other roads I need to travel to Staples. I have found that the public transit takes time, but is very convenient. You can take the Orange Line in the valley to the Red Line and take that to 8th and Figueroa. You can then walk a couple of blocks to Staples.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisz282
50,Landmark,"The #1 sport arena in LA!! Not only basketball games and hockey games but also many great concerts/shows performing there. Love the atmosphere because of the big crowd and everyone is cheering. FUN!There are always lots of staffs on duty. They are always there for any assistance. For example, CAN'T FIND THE SEATS!Now there are more variety of food vendors other than McDonald's or CPK. I love the bottomless soda $7 and bottomless popcorn $6. Trust me, I will make it worth it for those few hours of game!! :DThe Parking: Parking structure at Staple or Nokia Live ($20-$25). Ouch!!

40,"Great acts, sports","If you want to see your favorite act in LA, if they're not at the Forum, they're here. The good thing about Staples now is all the restaurants within walking distance.

40,Overall good experience,"First time visiting this venue and attended a concert here. We had excellent seats so cant speak for through out but the sound was great. It was a center stage setup with a screen and a center screen too, so it seemed that no matter where you were you would get a good view. The staff and security here were AMAZING. Been to many a concert where it is obvious folks hate their jobs but we never got that impression here.Location is surrounded by tons of shopping and restaurants, and it felt safe walking to fro parking. Parking is a bit confusing to get too and find, but once you do it was easy to get in out and price was comparable to what you may pay in any city center. LOVED the amount of ladies rooms! Thank you kindly Staple for keeping us ladies in mind. We live sports too!! Food was fairly priced as well for this type of venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mtnlvrs
20,"A soulless, cavernous facility","I've been here for concerts and for basketball and it's never been a very memorable experience. Maybe if I was court side but they have a great level of seats, a second great level of seats, THREE levels of private boxes and then the seats for us riff raff. Springsteen played there its first weekend and announced from the stage he didn't like the place. He's played at the Sports Center or the Forum since then. There's nothing exceptional wrong with Staples but I don't think ANYONE likes going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814charlesz
50,Premier Seats & Floor,"Premier seats perfect for Laker, Clipper Games, even Kings. You get an all around view. Floor seats are perfect for concerts. No strollers allowed inside.

50,ballgame night with Lakers and Spurs,"It's a thrill of a lifetime, both teams are my favorites... the location is in the heart of nightlife fun... bars, clubs, resto of quality. Ambience inside is so overwhelming especially the big screen in the middle top of the court, you will feel the fun and excitement of the spectators of the game... we were seated in a not so close to the court area, but its good enough to see our favorite players... we were given souvenir Lakers towels to wave for Lakers everytime they score..... an experience to be shared... GO LAKERS.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iambalat
40,It was my first time there for a concert and I liked it,"I liked it as it does what it is suppose to do, host a concerned. The location is in the middle of Los Angeles and therefore it was a bit hard to get out of the area after the concert but that is normal. The surrounding area is clean and has a variety of restaurants. They could do a better job posting the parking lots as it is a bit confusing which one to use nearest to the Stable Center itself. Overall a good experiance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigA1999
30,it does what it says on the tin,"It's not horrible. It's a stadium and concert venue. It's right downtown, which is convenient if you can use public transit to get there, but obnoxious if you have to drive.

A friend who stays in LA brought us around the Center. It is a big place. At that time Taylor Swift is going to perform so that there were lots of things going on. A long queue for the tickets, interviews for Taylor Swift fans, posters, so we could really see the excitment if something will happen in the Center. Although finally we could not find any Lakers promoted items but it was still good that we have a chance to see Staple Center .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O754ZBdonnas

We asked one of the promoters at the front and he said it was only 16 dollars to get in to watch a women's basketball game. Having never seen a game before we went in with no expectations at all and it turned out to be a great decision. The atmosphere of the whole place was great and just a fun few hours in general. Would highly recommend it to anyone of any age who is even mildly interested in sport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178harryw

40,Great Venue,"Great place to see a concert or a sporting event. I have been there 5 times in the last year and have sat anywhere from the private boxes, to the nose bleed sections. Lots of places to get food, beer, wine, and merchandise. Lots of great restaurants across the street. The safest parking lot I have found is also right across the street, however, it is pricey. $25 for the night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyg554

40,Great place for sports lovers,My hubby and sons are avid sports fans so we visited the area and took pics in front of the Staples Center. Please note that there are many people doing the same thing so it was better for us to have dinner first nearby and go over a bit later to take photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pajeh
50,Kelly Clarkson!,I saw Kelly Clarkson there last week with Pentatonix and Eric Hutchinson. Such a great concert! The acoustics are very good. We had floor seats and I'm a big girl but it didn't feel uncomfortable. There is plenty of parking around the venue and lots of street vendors selling food and water outside after the concert lets out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wannahula

40,"Great Venue, but maybe not for all events!","We attended the Kelly Clarkson concert at the LAStaples center on Wednesday, August 20, 2015. We found the tickets on a discount site and figured we'd give it a shot. While I've been at the Staples Center on several occasions, I had paid full price and, therefore, was able to control the seat I had. We have always enjoyed our events here, but this time I will confess to being disappointed in the venue ONLY because they chose to sell ""obstructed view"" seats when the theater was not sold out. I'm sure we've all attended events when we wished we had bought (or could afford!!!) better seats, but our discounted tickets were at the very top tier of the event center (which we expected), and SO FAR off to the side that it made even viewing the jumbo screens and impossibility. I will say that the sound was excellent, no problems there. However, if Staples is going to release their tickets to a discount house, then I feel it is their obligation to inform that the seats will have an obstructed view.Another thing...parking. Thankfully I had done some advance research only to learn that parking at Staples Center can be the most ridiculous rip off. Parking stubs are not validated and you will pay through the nose at the end of the evening if you don't do your homework. I believe the first two hours only cost $5, but it will cost you $5 more each extra half hour. I believe it maxes out at $30. Wow!! THAT'S EXPENSIVE!!! If at all possible, take the LA Metro...you'll pay a fraction and it's a short walk from the Pico Station. (Current rates are $1.75 one way per person.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugs4u
50,Great Place,Went to see the Pentatonics and Kelly Clarkson and it was an amazing venueI wish there was a better assortment of restaurants however seats were comfortable and parking was relatively easy and only about $ 10.00. Staff was very friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71

50,Fun times,"I've gone to the Staples Center for games and concerts and enjoy the venue each time. I like that the Staples Center has a method in place for managing the crowd. Being a New Yorker, I often feel like the processes here are always chaotic. It's great to go to a venue and be able to get in and out and find ample parking (although expensive). I also enjoy the area around the Staples Center. I was last here for the BET experience and had so much fun literally dancing in the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CulturedBlackPearl

You can park for a nominal fee at a nearby parking garage, walk across the street to LA Live and you will have many dining options to choose from ranging from low budget to fine dining.

50,Great Venue,"Home to the Los Angeles Kings, Clippers and Lakers, not to mention the various concerts and other events there. . This is a great venue. There is not a bad seat in the house. The view from the upper deck is good, but the seats are smaller and at a steeper incline. The lower decks the views are good and the seats are larger. No matter what your pleasure is, the Staples Center is the venue to enjoy it at. However, the food and drinks are a bit pricy. Still a great place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T100BAKER

20,KCON (KGONE) / KPOP Concert,"I was taking my granddaughter to the KPOP Concert on Aug 1 and 2, 2015. We had been in the Convention area all day at the KCON Convention. I had bought Premium Tickets for both nights and parking. Little did I know the parking was going to be further away than regular parking which was cheaper. Then to top it off when we were getting in line for the Concert, there was no one to direct people to the right areas, or stop anyone from cutting in line. We stood in like for an hour and missed approximately 15 minutes of the concert. When we got to the door that is when the usher/security told us that we were in the wrong line. By that time needless to say I was agitated and just went to our seats. We did have a great time at the concert, but the food was limited and very expensive. This was our first time there. The next night was easier as I found out where we should have gone the first night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortdlee

40,Not really an attraction?,"Don't get me wrong, I love LA Live, Staples Center included. For those coming for a visit though, this is certainly not a place to go out of your way to see. You can take a picture with it from LA Live, but I don't think you can even get in without a ticket.It's fun to be inside, and I've been to concerts, hockey and basketball games here. It's surprisingly large inside, and very steep towards the top. It's always great fun though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious1991

50,Simply awesome!,"I took my wife here because it is the Home of the Los Angeles Lakers and home to the Los Angeles Kings. I just wanted her to see the place even though the Lakers aren’t playing currently. We just asked if we could enter and take a few snapshots inside. The uy looked at me and I showed him my Laker tattoo and he said go ahead. I was so grateful. I wanted to take her downstairs so badly but I felt guilty and didn’t want to take advantage of his goodwill. She was in awe of the place. I’ve been many times to the Staples Center to watch my Lakers. The place has fond memories for me and when I move back permanently to the area, she will see the Purple and Gold and hopefully they will have a better team, lol.Parking is expensive and we just usually park around the corner down the street and enjoy a bacon wrapped hot dog. I read some bad reviews that said there are ghetto thugs outside. What? Have you been to LA? We are a diverse people and just because we don’t match your color, we are not ghetto thugs. Relax, take a chill pill and enjoy the diversity of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

50,Good for Lakers/Clipper fans,"If you are a fan of Lakers/Clipper, go! The stadium is larger than other NBA stadium (like Rose Garden) so if you buy the cheapest ticket, it'd be kind of far.

40,Visiting the venue,I am paralyzed. The first visit was to watch the 2008 Summer Slam. It was exciting and a joyful event the only problem I had was our seats were nearly lost because the workers pulled the bleachers out and made the space untenable. When my party and I went to the special needs office to find out what was going on. The worker had no idea and acted like we just didnt understand how to use the facilities. After about 15 people with varying degrees of disabilities filled the office the worker realized the seriousness of what our complaints. I came back for other wrestling events and did not have any trouble. The interesting thing was like at the United Center they have statuary of famous Lakers who have made the team famous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wheelerbob

50,Great Sports Venue,"I've been to Staples Center several times for Kings games. It's pretty nice & the boxes are nice, though expensive (I've gone through a business-owned box). I don't what concerts are like there. Area outside has restaurants, so you're not stuck just eating there. Plenty of parking. You can walk all over the area (jewelry mart; Broadway is being re-gentrified).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539marleneh
30,"Be Aware, Be Safe and Have Fun","I have been to the Staples Center on many occasions, and so I speak from experience. It is located in a very sketchy part of Los Angeles (I had a friend who had split off from our group one time who was assaulted on her way to her car, for example), and I CAN tell you how to go and leave from there safely. Unless, you are arriving by limo service, do this...arrive VERY early for your event and park at the Holiday Inn valet parking that is kitty-corner from the front of the Center. They have a pretty good restaurant inside where you can do lunch, or an early dinner. A lot of people do this, so give yourself plenty of time. You will be in a large, safe crowd coming and going, have your car brought to you in a well-lit, safe area when you leave, and be worry free. Lock your doors when you enter your car to leave and make sure you already know your way to the freeway on-ramp. The center itself is okay, but not as good as say, The Honda Center. I've encountered a lot of rude employees, and some nice ones, as well, but its a mix. The staff doesn't seem as well-trained in public relations as they could be. I've had some fun times there, but not because of the venue itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miztude

50,Great place for a game or concert,"My husband and I were here for work. We got tickets to a Clippers game to go check out. This was our first time at the Staples Center after moving to town and it was great. We were in the suite which was so much fun. The folks we were with said the hockey games are awesome, however to get seats up close to the glass. The basketball game was great but very low key. The views look great from almost any location. There are places to eat or relax before the events outside and many options for parking. You could easily take the train over too. Look at options since traffic is LA is always part of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12

Staff inside the venue were very helpful.Having been to several NHL arenas recently and being surprised at the lack of wifi availabler at most arenas, it was a pleasant surprise to discover that the Staples Center was offering wifi. Food prices were more or less the same as most other arenas. The massive Kings store was a great place to find all sort of Kings souvenirs.Sitting alongside a party of four who had never been to a hockey game before, they said that they loved it at the end. Yes it was a very close game and the Kings got their win.Would definitely visit the Staples Center again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reservarlden

As a venue it was great and the seating was fine, my only problem was upon arrival I was told my camera lens was too big and I wasnt allowed to take it in with me. Now as a tourist getting her camera confiscated I was devastated. I had all of my holiday snaps on it and was worried it would get lost. I generally never let it out of my sight.

50,Clippers and Lakers Games - Different views!,"I saw two NBA games at the Staples Centre in March/April – a Clippers and a Lakers game. The Clippers game we were very close to the action in section 105 row J – seats 1 & 2. These seats are at the baseline of the court but ARE FANTASTIC. They are to the side and along the tunnel where the away team (in this instance the Warriors) ran in and out. This is also where the people who sit on the floor seats come in and out so the chances of seeing a celebrity are very good! We saw Drake go in and out a few times which was so cool. The view of the court it awesome and being at the baseline gives a new perspective. You are not blocked by the hoop and can see up the whole court. Great seats and I would sit here in a heartbeat again. The Lakers game we were sitting much further away in section 316 row 6. The view of the court is still good, albeit further away. It’s almost centre so you get a good view of up and down the court – and for the price a pretty good way to see an NBA game. We paid about $20 each for these tickets. The food at the staples is basic arena food, hot dogs, nachos etc. and is more expensive than food outside but won’t send you broke. Staples is an easy train ride from Hollywood/Highland if you’re staying in that area. Just be conscious there are some ‘interesting’ characters on the train, so if you want to avoid that then a cab is the way to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spazwok

Its a large venue, but the sightlines are very good from anywhere except the upper upper level (that's a bit far for my tired eyes). Sound quality is great and the fans are usually super well behaved. Even if you're not going to an event, the area surrounding the satadium is worth the visit. Statues of famous players (Kareem, Gretsky, etc.) and others (Chicl Hern, Oscar De LaHoya) adorn the entrance and you are right across the street from LA Live's tons of attractions (Grammy Museum, restaurants, bowling, nightclubs, hotels) and the endless new places popping up all over downtown (DTLA).

40,Home of the Lakers!!!,"I would suggest that if you can afford it, try to get seats in the Premier Section via Stub Hub and make reservations at the buffet upstairs in the Premier section. The food it pretty good and the seats are great. The only complaint I have is that in our section there were some very rude and loud ""fans"" talking throughout the game....and their talking had nothing to do with the game. Parking can be expensive, but we tend to park east of Staples for about $10-15 and walk the short distance (5-10 minutes).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmyla
50,"Easy to find, park, and get to.",We have been to the Staples Center on many occasions and I was nervous with the traffic on 110 heading there that it would be a mess once we were near the center. I was so surprised it was easy to find parking nearby and to get in and out of the area after the ball game or concert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiM506
50,Lakers Game,"We got tickets late notice from stub hub, the seats where at the back but it didn't matter.Great venue would definitely recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gh417
50,Went to see Bette Midler,This was an excellent concert. this was our first time at the Staples Center. As a former L.A. Person I loved the athletes statues. It was an easy in and out and all the seats had a great view of the stage. Restrooms and concessions are easy access. Loved L.A. Live.We will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billstans123
50,Superb NBA experience at Staples center,"Spring of 2014 on a tour as a family of 3 our 2nd stop in the US was Los Angeles. We stayed at the Ritz Milner hotel which is just a couple of blocks away from Staples center. It was a very memorable game I'e experience in my US tour and definitely one of the highlights. The stadium was huge, game exhilirating and alive and most especially the fans are very excited and lively as well as people working in the arena who were very friendly and helpful. We were sited on the upper box section but I felt I'm seated in the ringside because the inside of the arena feels like alive. I was also sick that time but I don't feel like I got a cold because the game itself made me forget it. It was me and my parents first experience watching an NBA game and our first time in Staples center and Los Angeles yet it was my most memorable trip in the west coast - I can't wait to go back and watch another NBA games and to end my review as Lakers fans said - LET'S GO!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krubee
40,Arrive early!,"For us, after we got off the freeway we turned on to Figueroa st. and began our search for parking. There were men in the street holding Signs with different amounts. The first one was $15,then 20,30 and 40 being across the street. All lots are within 2 blocks of the center. Very easy. They open early so you can eat inside. Many choices of food stands. Plenty of bathroom, and most seats are good. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag

50,Basketball holy land,"The whole building is so huge, even beyond my imagination. We saw a Lakers' game against Sper, and eventually Lakers lost it. However, we still enjoyed the show, the music, and the atmosphere. Laker's girls are awesome. Remember to book a parking space(I used Parkme) in advance to save money. After game over, fans walk everywhere near ths stadium; so you don't have to worry about the dark street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benjamin0723

Arena is safe and a lot of food and beverage options inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933jonathana
40,Exciting place!,"I was so excited to visit this place, and I was not disappointed when I finally got there.

50,LA Kings have amazing fans!,"This was our first time to the Staples Center and we were there to cheer on our home town Oilers. We were treated very well by the surrounding Kings fans and because we got our butts kicked, we didn't pay for a drink for most of the night! Local fans are very respectful and generous, probably cause we lost so bad but either way we met great people that sat around us. Will definitely attend any chance we get. The fans there are way more energized than the Ducks fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oilfan1077
40,Great for sports. Not good for concerts,The arena is beautiful good bars and restaurants inside. Nice and clean and very classy for a sports arena. Seats comfortable. Quite the scene.

50,Smiling Staples,"During my visit to the Staples Center, every encounter was smooth. From the moment we stepped in, everyone of the employees were smiling, even the nice ladies who were cleaning the bathrooms; I chatted them up cause they seemed to be having fun doing their jobs!!The food selection was ample and not overly priced-only I didn't get to buy a drink because the Margarita machine was down.Next we sought out to find our seats, and again the ushers were all smiles! I have been wanting to see my favorite player in the NBA league Kawhi Leonard, the seats were good enough to see without minimizing his actual size.I was overjoyed that I was finally here.After the game, I wore a very large smile for two reasons; because my team won and it was our anniversary.Another thing I wanted to add was how classy the Clippers fan behaved themselves, I was one of the few rooting for the other team, and though some people leered at me, I never felt threatened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agapilexi
50,Great for hockey and concerts,"I've seen Taylor Swift and 2 Los Angeles Kings games here in the last few years....I booked a parking spot very close to the arena and it was only about a two block walk....I love the palm trees surrounding the arena....the floors of Staples Center were so clean that they sparkled! I arrived earlier for the Taylor Swift concert, so I bought some pizza and found a sunny table to eat at.....I liked the tables up against the windows in the California sunshine...the ushers were friendly and were knowledgeable about the arena, which is important to me, especially since I'd never been there before...Staples Center is easily accessible from the interstate coming from LAX, too....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Georganne88

50,Awesome stadium,Watched the Clippers play here - loved it. The view from the top is surprisingly pretty good. The big screens obviously help too. As an Australian I was quite taken aback by the prices of the beers though - upwards of $11!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcMenz
40,A very different place,It was a great experience for a non-American like me to be in the Staples Center and see a Laker match.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999400
50,wonderful arena,"Lakers were always the dream team for me since my childhood, and so was the staples center. We exploited the opportunity of being in LA for the first time although none of the teams (lakers vs sacramento) were at their most successful season. The arena is really great although the first row of 3rd section was a little scary with a very short glass fence in front of the seats. There are not many food alternatives inside, so I reccomend to eat something ourside before the game unless you want to have mcdonalds like us. It is a must to be there before you die",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Omeralpb
40,Corporate room,"Private room the way to go, food was ordinary however a lot of the food in LA ordinary. Good beers, great service and all about the atmosphere of being at the game. They know how to party started The Staples",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotg20
40,a must visit in LA,We passed the Staples Centre just about every day whilst touring LA. This place has such history and we had to pose for photo-shoots out here. My fave was the selfies with Oscar De La Hoya and the like. Chilling in the precinct for coffee made the visit all the more worthwhile!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delainec
50,Go Lakers!!,"We came all the way from Perth, Australia, to watch to Lakers play, it was amazing, the stadium is Fantastic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannona608

50,Great Volleyball tournament,"The center was loaded with thousands of people and whistles, and screaming...it was very sound friendly. Super Clean, easy to get in and out of. Parking was so simple. There was lots of staff to help us. TONS of bathrooms (very clean). The food could be healthier :) luggage check was so easy and convenient. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mombeto
50,Went to a Lakers Vs Clippers game,The arena is very new and i have bent both Lakers and Kings games here on multiple accounts. I am a huge hockey fan and would recommend for that going down to the Honda Center as Kings games can be rather boring and quite. A lakers game on the other hand even when the team isn't performing well is a great experience and the crowd level of energy is a exhilarating experience. You don't have to be a basketball fan as my wife is not and has enjoyed multiple games here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterholland18
50,"Awesome arena , fantastic atmosphere","Visited the staples centre on a family holiday from England. We watched the LA Kings play ice hockey and win. Great night, atmoshere was awesome. Lots of parking in the area although $20 and above. Lots of good places to eat nearby for a reasonable cost. Would highly recommend going to see the ice hockey if you are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tct2701
50,Friendly staff,"The Staples Center is home to the LA Lakers who we went to see. Whilst the Lakers played terribly ..... It was their last game of the season and it was lacklustre to be polite, the stadium was terrific. We have been to a lot of basketball all over America this trip and Staples Center had the healthiest option of foods available, which I was most impressed with. The staff were wonderful, helpful and considerate as I find most American staff. Australia could certainly use a lesson in manners and courtesy from our American counterparts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda63_12
40,Good for Ice Hockey but be early for dinner,We got there early (2 hours before game time of an LA Kings game) but still struggled to find place for dinner..... it was so packed. The stadium itself was good and easy to access seats and facilities and such so I would recommend it as a place to watch sport for sure. The LA live set up nearby has plenty of restaurant choices but maybe making a reservation well in advance would be a good idea. We pre-arranged parking which was easy at local car spot and had no issues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiger70SH
50,Lakers Game,"Nice Clean Venue, good LA teams store. easy to get around stadium. well behaved crowd.With the lakers winning, the whole crowd even got free taco vouchers for jack in the box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopstar87

40,Awesome Venue,Parking is in abundance by Staples. We choose to park in a lot between 11th and 12 th Street. The lot charged us $15- for a Clippers Game Night when around the area they usually charge $25. It's very convenient to 10 East. Out of the lot take a left on Venice and follow that road straight to the 10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calitripgirl

50,Love this Arena!!!,"Coming from my home at Madison Square Garden it's hard to find an arena to challenge the amenities and atmosphere. There's a balcony bar you can stand outside during intermissions which I thought was so cool. The fans were very nice, even toward me who was wearing an away team jersey. Definitely would love to go back and see another kings game here! And if you're in the area, would totally recommend catching a game",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poprocks5

50,Awesome experience at the Lakers game!,"My husband and I travelled from Toronto, Canada to LA for the first time and enjoyed a Lakers game at the Staples Center. It was a great experience! We were able to travel via the metro train from Hollywood (where our hotel was located) directly to the Center, and the train stopped literally across the street. It was a short walk to the Center once we got off the train. There is a variety of food and concessions available at Staples Center along with their ""wall of fame"" where you can take photos with the NBA Championship trophies! Overall, a great entertainment venue, easily accessible by public transit, and an awesome game experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trini_traveller08
30,Went to Kings game,Traffic was awful to and from the game - worse than many other metropolitan areas. Also the interior of the building seemed dated and the layout was confusing. I attend hockey and baseball games around the country and this is one of the few places where I was disappointed by the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johncP5477OA
30,Expensive,"Food at the Staples Center is good - though the hot dog buns are bland and often stale and ruin an expensive dog - but otherwise it's all okay. Get the peanuts, skip the rest and get a burger or something else affordable after the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddg735
40,Big stadium lots to see and do.,Went here for a Lakers game. You don't realise how big it is inside from the outside! Obviously has a lot of history due to the sports played there. Pretty good to get around with good directions. Lots of statues and places to eat and drink in and around the center. Would highly recommend to go and watch a game and get food afterwards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMysteriousOne
30,Nice to see,"Staple Center for itself is nice to visit. Not more. The interesting stuff in terms of statues is in front of it. alot of statues of popular athletes (basketball, boxing, athletics, etc...)Check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gorang753
50,Went just to see the statues,I am a sports nut so i went down town just to see all the statues. Nice place to walk around with some shops and restaurants in the surrounding area.

40,Clippers was awesome,"Attended a Clippers game for my trip to the Staples Center. The statues outside Staples was great as we get to see of the greats who called this place their home. What I liked most about it was it has more walking room in concession areas than other stadiums I have been to. It was relatively easy to get around crowds of people and get to my seat, bathroom or vendor. The court itself is nice. The game is great and the Clippers did win so that was cool also.Would definitely recommend to any fan of either the Lakers or Clippers to come here and see at least one game in their lifetime, It was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pharmacyguyX

50,Godfather,Beautiful complex. Saw the Godfather movie with a live orchestra. Sound throughout the theater was fantastic. Our seats were towards the front off to the side but still had an excellent view of the entire stage. Seats are comfortable and plenty of legroom. Line at the bar was long but went fast even during intermission. Food offerings were minimal but we didn't go there to eat. If there's an event there you want to see then this venue is perfect. Very comfortable!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988timg

40,Center of LA!,I went to watch Kings vs. Penguins game with my bf in a box seat during a visit to LA.The building looks cool in purple and with a lot of fancy events going on around on a Saturday night. We saw people in ball gowns and suits walking on the red carpet in a building next to Staple's Center. You feel like you are a part of Hollywood life walking on the street nearby.Parking is not a problem and it's 20 bucks for most of the parking lots.It's my first time watching a hockey game in live... it's so funny to know that the players actually fight in the game hahaha... but i would really love to watch a Lakers game here. Hopefully we will get that chance in the near future!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey39259356879
50,great multi-purpose venue with excellent sight lines,Fantastic arena in downtown LA. Plenty of local parking both at the venue and cheaper options within 2 blocks. Where ever you sit you'll have an good and unrestricted view. There are plenty of food options which are expensive but not outlandishly so. There are more food options around the Staples in an area known as LA live.The are plenty of toilet facilities and an escalator.Getting out of downtown after an event can be slow but if you can come by metro it is quick and easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/researcher59
40,Great To See A Game or Concert,"I loved watching the Lakers here. It's also a great place for concerts. The one downfall is the traffic. Maybe get there early if you're on your way to an event. And have coffee or dinner or whatever nearby first like The Palm or somewhere. Know that traffic after the event will be bad, as well. They're well-organized at The Staples Center and are good at dealing with the crowds. The staff is friendly and the food is good enough. I do always buy great seats because I don't like going to events and feeling like I'm watching on TV. Although, the fun crowd doesn't make it seem like that, I suppose. It's pretty easy to park here and cabs are usually readily available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
50,Consistent and good!,I have been to several games in the past year from basketball to hockey and the venue stays consistent with customer service and cleanliness. Decently easy to get to with parking options. Best advice is to search and search again on the web for different tickets options and prices. It's amazing the different details that people will post including a picture of the main court/area where the action takes place so you have an idea of what your view will look like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynJ22

50,Lakers Game at the Staples Center,"We went to the Lakers vs. Thunder game on 3/1/2015. The Staples Center is a nice venue. We had seats in section 207; in the last row. The view was decent from this section, so I can't complain. There was no waiting (or a short wait) for drinks, food, restrooms, as there were plenty of choices around the whole center. The Lakers lost :( , but we still enjoyed the game. We took the Metro from Universal City station to 7th Street. It was about a 15 minute walk from the 7th street station to Staples Center. This was great, as we did not have to deal with parking or the cost to park. After the game, it was an easy out and back on the Metro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingtheworld_00
40,Fun at Lakers game,"Even the surrounding is already impressive with status of the great Lakers like Magic and Kareem. The arena is functional with everything easily accessible from your seats to food, souvenir shops, bathrooms, you name it. We saw the Lakers playing Milwaukee and enjoyed the good atmosphere and free tacos thanks to the Lakers' win. Really recommendable but do yourself a favor and don't buy ""cheap"" tickets from creepy guys near the entrance. We got tickets at the box office 15minutes before the game started.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tobias2402

What a wonderful venue and they really know how to make the experience comforting for first time visitors. Information staff on arrival were helpful, plenty of food outlets offering variety. Outdoor terrace was very pleasant. We had seats in the upper deck and we still enjoyed an excellent view of the game. We caught the Metro to the station ( Pico Station) and it was only a short walk to the Stadium. We had a very enjoyable night and the Clippers won!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesr985
40,2 NBA Games,"We went to 2 NBA games in March at the Staples Center and were very impressed. There are easily enough facilities, helpful staff and the seating was comfortable. Our seats were right up in the heavens but we could still see all the action easily. The Center is also big enough so there's no extreme crowding during the rush for the exit at the end of the games. Would love to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodthorn
40,Great sports arena,Transport links good. Food reasonably priced. Tickets expensive (go to Stubhub for best prices). Big screen replays. Very US style 'between play' audience participation in NHL/NBA games i saw.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superduagain
50,GO KINGS GO!!,"We LOVE Staples Center and have been many times to see our beloved L.A. Kings play. We live a couple of hours away but make it a mini vacation everytime we come. The arena is absolutely gorgeous and the staff is professional and very friendly. Parking is abundant for a fee across the street but worth the price. The VIP entrance is fantastic as is the VIP seating which is where we sit. It's awesome to have your food and drink brought right to your seat without standing in a long line. The food is quite tasty and convenient, which of course you're going to pay a bit more for but it's so totally worth it. We love coming to Staples and will continue to do so as the years roll on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zekesgirl

50,Great evening at the ice-hockey!,"We watched the LA Kings at Staples Centre. It was brilliant. Atmosphere was great. I would recommend anyone who is visiting LA to watch a game at Staples Centre. Just ensure you park at a secure car park. We had prebooked to book car in a car park that looked really isolated and dodgy. Car was fine, just felt quite wary parking there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennaMarieParry
50,Kings Game,"Great Atmosphere. The staff was super helpful and nice.

That's service!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamkat127

40,"Excellent arena, needs better, cheaper parking","Great place to watch a basketball game. Easy to get to from anywhere downtown LA. But there need to be better parking options. Not sure why cities can't figure these things out when they pour so much money into stadiums. Lots of great options around the area for food and drink before and after games. Also, great place for celebrity watching in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTWtraveler213

50,LA Kings vs Boston Bruins Hockey Game,"Went to the venue to watch a Hockey Game when over in USA Nov-Dec from Aus. Venue was greatly signposted, excellent in venue layout & easy to navigate. Heaps of parking in lots around the Centre for a reasonable fee. Short walk into the Centre & once in simple walk to your seating area.

40,Took in a Kings game,"Took the family out of snowy Boston to Disneyland. Went up to LA for the day and capped it off with a Kings game. Surprisingly impressed with the fan knowledge. Coming from Boston that's saying something. Staples Center is a nice venue...Big. We decided to park right at the arena and it was simple, $30 bucks and we literally parked against the place. We did see lots a block or 2 away for just $20. Hope LA appreciates how much easier they have it than trekking into the TD Garden in Boston!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaxDad275

50,"As far as LA goes, the tops","I have only attended this venue seven times until next month. Once as a walk through prior to it's opening, next as a freebe for a very short lived arena football team, once as a staff of the X-Games, twice for concerts, (Van Halen, and Roger Water's The Wall), and three times attending an LA Kings Hockey game. I have to say it is the ultimate. I never once had the privilege of any of the VIP/suite/luxury perks. I was just a 'normal fan' even if I was able to obtain my seats. There are two main entrances for us folks, either the boring Figueroa entrance of the exciting Star Plaza entrance adorned with bronze replicas of Magic, Kareem, Gretzky, Chick Hearn, and now Luuuuuuuc Robalatile. Upon entering you can easily find your seat due to a huge number of staffers. As a lone atttende you quickly get to know your seatmates and it becomes a fun friendly high-five match all around, win or lose. The sound system, lighting, and video is intense but never distracts from when the game is on. Bailey the mascot appears everywhere. Just an absolute fun time for young and old. some folks wear current jerseys and some date-back to the earlier Forum days. Just a great night. Can't wait for my next night, the final home game on April 11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
50,"Modern, impressive, clean, & friendly","I don’t know much about indoor arenas as I've been inside less than 10 of them, but this one was probably one of the nicest. Its flashy neighbors include the LA Convention Center, Tom’s Urban Café, Nokia Theatre, etc, all under the shadow of the towering JW Marriott.It was an easy walk from the parking garage near Hope & 11th streets. I was impressed by how clean the surrounding grounds as well as the interior appeared. We were there for a game and I was relieved the fans were tolerant and overall nice. Even the vendors in the main corridor were kind with their gentle ribbing (much appreciated!).

20,Worst fans in America,"Our first trip to watch the Kings play our Detroit Red Wings, we were very excited but when you wear your jerseys, you have become the enemy. In the food lines, the help see you in a wings jersey and look the other way, your are a second rate citizen; you go into the Kings store and even though you buy Kings merchandise again you are treated as second class people. Walking to your seats little kids say, Hey Red Wing fans, then everyone around them chants Red Wings Suck, the organist even adds to this with the chants that precede these chants during the game. The fans throw popcorn, peanuts, pop or beer on you. In San Jose the ushers walk the isles every five minutes, in LA you didn't see one. They can keep there animals there. They talk about road rage, someday someone there will have to answer why it was allowed to get so far out of hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271marcw

Unlike games at home that are sold out months/years in advance, we were actually able to order tickets online and get premium seats for a very reasonable price. The only downside is that the crowd seemed to be a little quiet/subdued compared to what we are used to up north.Tip: Premier Seating includes in-seat drink/food service and you can enter the building through the VIP entrance to avoid some of the lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mt-42
50,First game in a sky box,Watching a game from the box was an experience I will never forget. Food was wonderful and the desert cart was over the top. They did a very good job with everything. Being a basetball fan this is a great wat to watch a game. You could really see the action perfect.

However, I was pleasantly surprised that going to Staples presented few hassles: parking was easy; LA Live is fun to walk around in; traffic isn't really that bad, getting in and out.

Went 3 times to watch 3 different NBA games and sat in a variety of seats ranging from near the front to right at the back. All of the games were great.There is parking nearby and restaurant options right outside the building.Getting to building itself can be a bit of a hassle as traffic can get quite hectic closer to the game. Would recommend getting there early and getting something to eat and watch the players warm up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392jayk

30,Kings season seat holder,"As a Kings season ticket holder since it opened back in '01, the venue has steadily declined. $20-$30 to park across the street is atrocious. You can find cheaper lots the further you get away from the arena, but fortunately there is still some free parking to be had if you know where to go(sorry, that's a secret, lol). The venue could do for some new food concessions. When the venue was new there was mcdonalds, panda, and pizza hut, along with the general stadium fare. Now, there still is mcdonalds, and cpk, and the usual stadium fare, with Wetzels Pretzels being the outstanding one. Thankfully the bbq place at the smoking area got so much heat from Kings, Lakers, and Clipper season ticket holders for changing the chicken tender meal at the start of the season from 3 tenders to 2, and keeping the same price, that about a month after the season started they were back to 3 tenders in the meal. The people spoke, and management listened, rare in this day and age. Most of the employees working there are friendly and helpful, but beware the redcoats. A lot of times they think they're above everyone else since they have the power to remove people. Seats are comfy after being redone last summer, and the new scoreboard makes game viewing that much better. My recommendation, go for sports, skip the concerts. Sound and sightlines are terrible, and after going to a concert last summer at the newly redone Forum, Staples doesn't compare. But if you do go to a concert at Staples, pay the extra for the PR seats. All in all though, Staples is a good place for a night of fun. How to do a night at Staples the cheapest? Take the subway in(free parking and $6 all day), eat and drink at one of the many restaurants beforehand(your wallet will thank you), with El Cholo and Rock n Fish as my suggestions, along with the Yardhouse, if you get there early enough, and if you still want to hang out for a bit after the game, LA Live has numerous places to go, and you won't have to worry about driving, for a little bit, anyways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabomiamor

50,Kings Game,We caught the Kings vs Capitals game at Staples Center last nite. What a nice venue! It's a very spacious and relatively new arena and great place to watch hockey. The fans were very friendly and respectful to us as we were wearing the opposing team's jerseys. We parked 2 blocks away off the main road on Pico at Hope St. at a closed restaurant parking lot and paid $20 instead of the $30 at the arena and within a block of. There is a Hooters and a Mexican bar restaurant on Figeuroa across from the arena. We ate inside the arena but the Mexican restaurant was enticing as it claimed a roof top deck. The arena is very easy to find with a GPS.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PHLee7ca

50,Showtime! What a great venue,"Visited for the first time and it was really fun. Approaching the stadium at night is fantastic - all uplit in blue with the LA skyline as a backdrop. We had VIP tickets and entered parking with ease immediately next to the stadium. The $200 valet leaves the most gorgeous and gawk-worthy cars in front of this entrance. What was gritty LA about the setting were the two pan handlers waiting for people as they exited. It didn't seem to bother anyone that the incongruent show of wealth was next to the hustling poor. City life does that.A steep escalator inside the gate delivers visitors to the row of suite doors, accessible only by bar code reader on your ticket. The suite's set up for a dozen people, with a chair for each, as well as one sofa, and a self service kitchen stocked with hot dogs, buns, soda, water, and desserts. Pricey beer & wine and other food is outside the suite at the general concessions.We had a great view of the Lakers as they lost to the Wizards. The game points were close so the mood in the Center stayed interested and competitive right to the end. My friend brought up a map on the iPad showing where celebs hold floor seats. That and the kiss-cam showed us Cameron Diaz & her new hubby. How apropos for a SoCal event so close to Hollywood.The jumbotron featured a tribute to Dr Bussy (RIP) and a pre-recorded speech by Kobe. I then realized the big ring trinket given to everyone coming in the door was a memorial. My idea to later use a couple rings as game night napkin ring holders went immediately away. o well. Who the heck uses napkin ring holders on game night anyway?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieRoss
50,Great atmosphere!,Watched the Bulls vs Lakers and the atmosphere was awesome. I'm a Bulls fan and the Lakers fans are really cool people. The people we sat by were so friendly and fun. The center and LA Live are lively and it's surrounded by people that want to have a good time. It's walkie distance to multiple parking garages if you don't want to pay the $$ to park at the center. I had a great time and can't wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818stellad

40,Easy to get to and a huge range of food options,We watched 2 NBA games and found public transport a great option to get here. Once inside there is a huge range of dining options which are reasonably priced for a venue like this.

During the cold months they have warmers set up so its not so cold outside. Kings fans are nice we are not mean to the visiting fans so everyone can enjoy the game. As for the food you can eat anything from hotdogs and hamburgers, nachos pizza, BBQ and there are a lot of things going on in the arena as well as during intermission on the ice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la660
30,Nice place to watch a game,"Decent seats in the upper level, we could still see the entire game. Disappointed with the cost of tickets though. I'm young and don't have children but the only thing I can think of is families trying to take their kids to see an NBA game - it would cost a family of 4 a minimum $250 for ONE NIGHT!! Absurd.Otherwise, the stadium is nice and I enjoyed the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssm6
50,FUN,"Lexus room is great for food. Buffet is delicious with all you can drink mimosas and my fave bloody mary! The assortment of sushi, salads, stuff bellpepers and then there are pancakes and eggs benedict. We could not get enough of it. Then they let us take our drinks to game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895melc
50,Fantastic,"What a great facility. My wife and I saw two nba matches there and it was easy to get to and get home from, food was realisably priced and seating was comforting on level 1. Only down side were the feral laker fans. We come fromAustralia and we thought collingwood fans were feral but they have nothing on the foul mouthed poor sports that are called laker fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timbX493ZC
50,Go kings,Had a seat in a suite and it was fantastic. Highly recommend trying a suite if you have never been in one. Insuite you can order food and beverages delivered. Nice seats and a few bar stools as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkVatta
40,Go Kings,Watched the game my girlfriend has season tickets I loved it. The ice skating rink was open and it was very festive. Great date night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayfromcali
50,Great spot,"Family trip to see LA Lakers and saw Kobe Bryant play. Won by 1 point against Indiana Pacers and was exciting in 2 half. Lakers first win of the year and the atmosphere was great. American basketball is special, we don't get that in Australia. Worth a trip and not far to get to from Hollywood. Lots of parking close to Staples Centre and easy walking, so you don't need prepaid parking across from the Centre. We paid 3 times as much to be in the VIP area only because we did not know. Get tickets from the LA Lakers website and delivery is by email. Easy to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayILikeIt
50,Clippers vs Heat,Our first ever basketball game and we had a fantastic time! What an atmosphere! I cannot recommend highly enough to attend a game if you get the chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9474GOmatthewb
50,NBA game environment just fabulous,"This is very late but we attended a Christmas game and it was just fabulous. The Staples Center was completely full and it was so exciting to be in. We loved it. The venue was fabulous. Across the road from LA Live which had all sorts of Christmas themes and activities happening. Stub Hub seems to be there too... so if you don't know... get your cheaper tickets by going there, you may just miss 5 mins of the game though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TK20132013
40,Great stadium,went for both an ice hockey game and then a basketball game and it was great to see the transformation. even if you sit high up you still see perfectly. Great location and lovely staff there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EventsCecilia
50,San Manuel Club is worth the extra cost!,"We had seats in the San Manuel Club and watched a Clippers game. The staff throughout the arena was both pleasant and helpful. There was a separate entrance, and we entered quickly. Our tickets showed a table, but we actually had four movie theatre like seats (2 in front and 2 behind) with a small tv in the front row, There was also a high top table for 4 behind the seats reserved for us as well. The tickets included a full buffet and beer and wine, with several choices. Other liquor was available for a cost. There was a waiter who constantly checked on us throughout the game. The buffet presentation was substantial, with soup, salad, a carving station, pasta, breads and cheeses, and several desserts. We were told before the food was removed, to allow us to get a last serving if we wanted. There was also an outside area with heaters as well. I would highly recommend the San Manuel Club for viewing any event at Staples Center!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flalove2travel
50,Great venue,"You get what you pay for. This is a huge arena/stadium and the better seats give you a better experience. Sitting in the ""nosebleed"" section is worthless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellboydquinnell
50,The Best Arena on The West Coast!,"Clippers, Lakers, and Concerts are all here. It is a massive complex with an intimate feel. Like Dodger Stadium, there are no really bad seats, just farther away. This new complex has every thing you need to enjoy the event you attend. Many different food and drink choices are yours. Just bring your wallet! If you thought this review was helpful, please let Trip Advisor know!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445ChrisR
40,First timer to the venue and impressed.,"Just recently went to a Lakers vs Pacers NBA game and found the overall experience here to be really good. We had Premier Seating which gives you the ability to have service at your seat and seperate entry etc to the venue. The service attendents were excellent and friendly, the view from the seats was great and the overall aesthetics of the venue were also excellent. If you get your tickets via Stub Hub be aware that the collection window is across the street that is normally closed for pedestrian access from the main entrance not the VIP. Also try and drive and you will find that hailing a cab is more difficult in LA than other places around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywood1973
30,Nice stadium but horrible team,I went to see the Lakers game a few weeks back. The stadium is pretty decent but the team was just horrible this year. The line at the concession stand was huge and the place is pretty dirty with all the food dropping and drinks spilling on the floor. We sat at the mid section and could see the game pretty well considering the price we paid for the tickets. Overall it was not a bad experience but the performance of the team this year is quite disappointing with Kobe and his lingering injury.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulcP1304DO
50,Easy as...,We went to three awesome NBA games at Staples Center over a long weekend in LA and I was really impressed with a number of things.Their entrance points are super easy and straightforward. Exiting the building was very easy given the amount of people that were leaving at once. Restrooms were always clean & available -no lines.Staff throughout the complex were very friendly and helpful and there was one older man in particular that served us at the Snack Bar who was just ever so lovely and looked after us so well - even after I spilt my soft drink right by the court!! (still cringing) I was more impressed about this man's rare genuineness than the celebrities we were sitting amongst.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnlBmb

40,Lots of entertainment in precinct,Lots of good restaurants and there was an iceskating rink set up as well as other activities (hockey) prior to the game. Was disappointed that you couldn't do a tour of the Staples Center. I had done a tour of Madison Square Garden whilst in NY and enjoyed it immensely and expected to be able to do a tour of the Staples Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869denises

40,Clippers won!,"Great game on Christmas Day, between Clippers and Warriors -- two hot teams in the NBA right now!. Great venue with Christmas festivities, including ice skating, across the street. Excellent seats with waitress service. Food/drinks were expensive. Half time show was spectacular. Only complaint -- took forever to get inside, even from the VIP entrance. A fun evening, and glad the Clippers won (Warriors have the best NBA record at present).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexander5431

50,We had so much fun at the basketball game!,"We went to the Warriors vs Lakers game and it was great! The atmosphere was wonderful and the crowd really got into the game. Probably because the Lakers actually won. ;)We didn't have to deal with parking or public transportation, so not sure what is available. We stayed at the Omni and used their wonderful courtesy car to get to Staples Center and back again.One warning: DO NOT bring cameras with long lenses. They will require you to take your camera back to your car, or check in your camera at Guest Services. Very annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CantFindMyBlueBird
50,Clippers Game!,"If you are travelling to LA, make sure you check out the NBA schedule to see if there's any game going on, because its awesome! The atmosphere, the game itself, all the cameras and food. Everything makes it worth your time AND money! You can buy a seat ""far"" (the further seat) and still watch it perfectly, and pay (depending on the game) only a few bucks ($15 in my case).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josec977
40,Beautiful place with one rude parking agent,"We were just there for the Clipers/ Raptots game. We were invited to a private birthday event. Everything from food to open bar to venue was great. We just have one complaint and that is the girl who was standing in front of the private parking was very rude and kept saying you are not on the list without really explaining or even looking at any lists. She was right in that the private event we were invited to was not including the parking but instead of benign so rude she could have just told us turn around and go to the general parking. She was a parking agent in an orange shirt so I imagine directing peoplewould be her job. Unfortunately we were kind of late and I didn't have the time to get her name but she was at the SW private entrance parking "" directing"" people and I have to say the only disappointment of the whole experience. I hope her superiors would have a talk to her and let her know that as a parking agent it's her job to direct people and to be polite to the visitors of this beautiful arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazeeandkavian

50,Amazing,"I saw Katy Perry live in September & it was awesome! Its only a few mins walk from the nearest metro stop ..definitely prefer public transport here because of the rush on event days. The surrounding LA Live area is full of energy. The staff was very helpful. Though I was in the top tier, still I had a great time..the sound quality was excellent and the crowd was electric. The bathrooms & food stalls were all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vineetmbbs

40,Really awesome!,We came here to see the Ice Hockey. After a mix up with the tickets we managed to get inside. It's a bit confusing and there wasn't anyone around to help us find our seats. It was packed with people trying to get food. It was a very interesting experience considering we hadn't been to an American sports venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412teganm

Great arena and the atmosphere was incredible especially for tourists as I was.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monicav7
30,Interesting,"For a first time visitor, its definelty something to see. Once inside and you navigate around the arena you soon realize that its just another arena. It is much cleaner, more spacious than the AirCanada Centre in Toronto. Staff are very helpful and friendly, something that you don'y always find in larger cities. Go visit, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocko2347
40,Excellent for Sporting Events; For Concerts It's Touch & Go,"For your Sparks, Clippers and Lakers games, this is an excellent venue. Elevators, escalators, plenty of handicap accessibility and food at this venue.For concerts, apparently depending on the crew, there may be problems with the sound. (When I saw Tina Turner in 2008, all sound was on point.) At the Maxwell and Jill Scott concert Summer of 2014, I was so disappointed because the sound was horrible. I had waited for years to see both acts and many people complained that we could barely hear the words. (For $99.50, It was a major let down.) The crews didn't appear to make a real effort to correct the problem--The entertainers even complained and apologized to the audience.For Sports they get an A+.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginas526
40,Home castle of the Kings,"If you are a hockey fan, this arena is for you. Designed for hockey, this building delivers with great views and ample seating.

40,Clippers Game,"My husband and I enjoyed a Clippers Game at the Staples Center. It is a very nice facility with escalators to take you to upper levels. There are nice look-out points around the arena where you can view the Hollywood Hills and LA skyline. The staff is friendly. The food is overpriced, but where can you find cheap food at a venue like this? There are a bunch of restaurants outside of the Center if you want to eat a nice meal prior to or after your event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMac511

50,Put it on your bucket list,"We just got back last night from a Kings Hockey game. We love the staples center. We (my wife and I) since it opened. I forget just how long that was, but it more than a few years. The facility is very comfortable, modern, and very high-tech. Food courts are very ""Hollywood-LA, and that's a good thing. Prices are very LA/Hollywood..meaning on the above average side, but again youget what you pay for. Good food, large portions. The company I work for had a suite for many years and that was fabulous. Good sound..LOUD but would one expect from that type of venue.If you get an opportunity to go to some event there, in my opinion, do it. Put it on your bucket list",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929MichaelT929
30,Industrial place.... Not warm and welcoming,"Its the ""coldest"" sport arena I have been to. Looking too industrial. Does its job - but I think the Ducks arena has got a much warmer feeling. Be aware that traffic around can be sloooow. It can take hours to drive a few km. It did for us - calculate plenty of time if driving there. Some weird seating numbers on lowest rows where we sat. Almost didnt find our seats. And, bring ear plugs for the young ones - its LOUD!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrodeEyolf
40,The New Heart of Los Angeles,"Staples and LA Live have given LA a new heart and done Brilliantly!!!Basketball, hockey, music. The arena is beautiful. The food is good (but I miss the pasta). The sight lines are always good, as long as I am on the upper deck.Hope they bring back ice skating across the street this winter",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNW-SoCal
50,Go Kings Go!,"Went with the lads for the Kings v NY Islanders game, had a great time! The atmosphere is electric in there, the whole place is just incredible. Naturally being English, we don't really get sports like this back at home with an atmosphere like that. Even though it's nearly a sell out and really busy, it's like you have all the space in the world to walk around. Just so much room, everything was really efficient with staff and any waiting times.The shop is massive and a great range of stuff. Was gutted when I got my Jersey I had to wait till the end of the first period to go get it back but I guess there are a lot of people wanting shirt printing done too!But still, we lost on a shoot out, but still was an amazing night, hopefully one day I can go back and see the Kings again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nawilliamson89

50,Lakers vs Rockets - NBA Opening Night,"I've wanted to see an NBA game live for over 30 years....and this year I finally got the chance....Lakers vs Rockets NBA Opening Night. As a Lakers fan the result was disappointing...but I did get to see Kobe play!!The venue itself is brilliant....it handles the crowd with ease and all seats appear to have good views (aided by the massive screen above the court!)We caught the LA Metro subway from Hollywood, transferred at 7th St and got off at Pico right across from Staples....amazingly convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mafman74
50,Brilliant,They really went all out on this place. It's just beautiful! Laker clippers kings.. Concerts galore! Always full of life and great energy . It's real pricey but it's just one of those things u save up for . A definite must in la. Transportation to and from here is definitely easy and affordable. Nothing but great times here.

40,You have to go,With so many games played there each week it's something you have to do - to experience a live game just once. Totally different to where I'm from (Australia) and well worth the investment for a night out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2JoanneD
40,LA Kings/ Anaheim Ducks.,Had seats to this hockey game as a treat for myself.We sat in the 4th row behind the Ducks bench.Center ice .Next time I would sit afew rows back.It was hard to see the game when your are too close to the ice. Also the coaches were obstructing the view. But it was exciting to be so close to the players.Couldn't really see the action at ether ends of the ice.We parked in Lot #1 which was very good.Good entry and exit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbrussels
50,Great Venue for Sports!,"My friend got us cheap tickets for a Clippers game before they became relevant again. Despite the seats being near the top, I was still able to see the court very well. It definitely beats the Great Western Forum nosebleed seats! I've also been to a Kings game there. The access into Staples Center is pretty easy, it's very clean, and there are plenty of places to grab food at if you didn't eat outside Staples Center already. You can also eat at one of the restaurants at L.A. Live before the game such as The Yardhouse, Wolfgang Puck, Rosa Mexicano, Smashburger, RockNFish, Katsuya, Live Basil Pizza, etc. The acoustics are very good as well. I would love to go to a concert here. I'm sure it would totally be worth the price. You can park three or four blocks away for cheap parking or across the street for $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASeoulGuy

10,ASX.com selling tickets for AEG Live in venues like Staples Center,"I loged on to Ticketmaster to purchase ""VIP"" tickets for an event at the Staples Center. I was re-routed to a purchase screen for ""ASX"". Evidently they sell the tickets for AEG venue events. With only 3 minutes to complete the sale I tried twice to change ""will call"" to another form of ticket in case I was unable to make the show. When I was unable to do that I made the purchase (to make sure I did not loose the tickets) and contacted ASX for help. At the very least I wanted my husband to be able to pick up the tickets if I were to be out of town (the ticket would only be avail 2 hours before show). After 10 minutes of the first call taker I moved on to the supervisor who informed me that if she were me she would not have spent that kind of money on tickets if she didn't know for sure she could attend.Hardly customer service… more like customer disservice. Buy from ASX at your own risk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeg339

50,Great place for Hockey,"I love attending Kings' games at Staples Center. It's easy to find your way around. Plenty of Ladies' rooms (for a change), and great venues for eating and drinking. It's in an active plaza with restaurants and clubs which stay open late, so there is lots of activities and you feel safe walking around, even late at night. There's nothing like hockey in person; the excitement, the sounds and the smell of the ice are things you just can't get on T.V. If you get a chance to see the Kings play in the afternoon, stick around and see how they turn the venue into a Clippers or Lakers game site for that night. A swarm of people put down a wood floor over the ice and change out all the banners in nothing flat. It's good to have a top-notch arena in our area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100SusanS

Always bring cash for parking (can cost anywhere between $7 in the prepaid lots to $20 in the lot behind the movie theatre). The drinks and food are pretty pricy too so its best to go to the Yard House or any of the other restaurants close by before the show. If you have the money, get the box seating - it is amazing and you can even order your own private sushi chef!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doublek23

30,Ugly,"Hit with an ugly stick at an early age, Staples Center is not aging well. Good architecture need not cost more than bad architecture; why did the Staples' folk go for the latter? Compare it to the Colisseum (in Rome or L.A.!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Go Kings,went here to watch an ice hockey game and the facilities and service out did anything I have had from back home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peppers49
40,good shopping,This center isn't very big but its so close to the Figueroa Hotel and has fast food places to eat. I had never been to an H and M store and it was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347debraw
40,LA Kings,We went to an LA Kings game on our recent holiday. We stayed in Hollywood and it was easily accessible by the Metro Rail. Lots of staff members to help direct you if needed. Food options were limited but we were after the experience with game food anyway so we were ok with that. Our seats were way up high but the view was still good and atmosphere great. We even made it onto the big screen a couple of times. This Aussie family loved our ice hockey experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4Fun2014
40,Great venue!,"I've been to the Staples Center before but haven't left a review.We had a nice suite for the Lakers game & overall the experience was pretty good.Easy to get to, traffic wasn't that bad & parking underground in & out was ok (expect to pay $25).It's really easy to get to the suite from the VIP entrance.The seats are comfortable.They have a pretty nice dessert cart comes by around the 3Q.The main downside is beverage service. If you're not doing bottle service in the suite the closest bar is 2 floors below. I'm surprised they didn't have any mobile service or make that portion easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VicandFawn
50,Great Atmosphere!,"We watched a Kings game. Easy to get here via the Metro Rail. There were no good places to eat food inside. Nothing healthy to eat. I would recommend eating outside at LA Live, but apparently you need to make reservations at least a month in advance. We ended up with two hotdogs and a water for $15. The arena was super cold, so make sure you dress accordingly. We sat up in section 316 but found the music was way too loud. We had a great view of the ice and the jumbotron is just amazing in this place. Multiple screens, they really show off the game. Would definitely recommend checking out a game here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J727YCkellyg
50,Go Clippers!,Conveniently located with the Pico Metro stop just outside makes it easy for tourists to visit without a car. I loved the 'seat view' option on the website when I booked my Clippers tickets - it's a huge arena and I wouldn't have wanted to end up with 'nosebleed' seats.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aodina
40,LA Kings game in a private suite,"The new inefficiency in sports events tickets is searching on the after-market for undervalued tickets. I always wondered what it is like to view a professional sports event from a box. Found suite tickets on StubHub for about 60% off.VIP entrance and access to the San Miguel Lounge restaurant. Dedicated waiter service through a phone in the suite for alcohol and general food. Each suite has a TV. Great experience. Concourses are wide and spacious and even during intermissions when everyone gets up to urinate or buy food, it didn't seem that crowded.Only drawback is that modern arenas and stadiums feel the need to blast music at 200 decibels during every time out so conversations in the suite even in the non-seating section were hard to have due to the loudness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmfronds
50,Visited a LA kings game and totally loved it...,"...nothing more to say really. The Staples Center is huge for a place to visit a hockey game (at least for people from Europe like me). Everything else is so to say typical american: Perfect organization, fast-food everywhere for reasonable pricing and a perfect show. The game was good as well - went to overtime and penalty shootout. LA Kings won, crowd went crazy. You should not miss it, when you are in LA.Little bonus advice: Use ParkWhiz for parking at the staples center. Maximum half a mile a way you can book reserved parking on guarded lots for 5 bucks and save some money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derflieger2003

10,A review of the not-so-great Staples Center... and not the fabulous things that happen there,"I was at the Staples Center for a sold-out Elton John concert. I arrived at the venue 45 minutes before the concert. When I arrived inside the center the lines for food and beverage were ridiculous. Several of the concession areas were closed which made no sense since Mr. John's concert had long been sold out. I estimated some lines were 30 minutes long - for a hot dog and a bottled water!The Staples Center is where Los Angeles goes for sports and entertainment. It is a shame that while the facility is very nice (clean, well-designed, pleasant to walk around), the service is not up to the standard of the events that take place there. (I did not let this bad service experience mar my enjoyment of Mr. John's knock-your-socks-off performance.) My advice to those traveling to see an event here: Make a reservation well in advance (at least a month) at one of the restaurants at L.A. Live, a complex next to Staples Center that has numerous food options (from high-end to a brewery atmosphere). My mistake was not making a reservation far enough in advance (everything was booked by the time I tried to make a reservation).Go to the Staples Center for the world-class entertainment and don't rely on Staples to provide anywhere near the level of service that a complex of this importance should.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950sonial

50,Fantastic,"Went to see a Kings game (ice hockey) last minute. We booked via ticketzoom and had amazing seats for a third of the actual ticket price. You do have to print the tickets yourself if they are sent via email but most hotels can help you with that. The venue is great with lots of food options inside and a great shop for all fan-stuff. Parking was easy, we paid 15$ and were very close. Metro was just as close. A tip: If you go see ice hockey, dress WARMLY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniquej865

40,Incredible venue,"What an incredible venue. It's eclectic in its ability to hold a plethora of different events. I've been to lakers games here to the Grammy awards. The staff here are all professional, and the suites are fantastic as well. Albeit, they are a bit far from the action on the floor... But fun nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamezn2014
40,"Cool Place, Easy Parking and good seats","I have been here over the past two years to Lakers, Kings and Clipper games. Even the cheap seats are pretty good and the kiss cam is cool as well as parking. Several times I was able to get $25.00 parking within 50 - 75 years of the front doors. You can also book parking in advance across the street. Hooters across the street is a good spot to get food during happy hour. You can also take the Metro Rail to the game. Pico would be the best route to take the games if possible. I have gone with friends, family and business associates. It is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr

There are quite a few food and Drink options which was nice. We had premium seating so we parked in parking lot 1 directly next to the stadium with its own entrance which is far less crowded and you dont have to walk. Parking lots can fill up quick and then parking is limited. There alot of restaurants and bars to enjoy before or after a game. that are right in walking distance (no need to move the car) that are great, mostly big chain places like the Yardhouse and LuckyStrike. Definitely a fun venue!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27

30,the food is bad,"I have season tickets for the LA Kings. I find the food at Staples Center to be barely edible. The best choice is McDonald's, if that tells you anything. A lot of the restaurants outside are really good, though. It would be great if we could bring in food from LA Live restaurants, even better if we could have it delivered to our seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgirod
50,An American experience in the impressive sport's centre Staples in LA,"I went to Staples with my husband, my daughter who lives in LA and a friend of her to watch a game with the Clippers. I love basketball and this place is incredible to watch a game. The stadium is used for many different kinds of sports and events.The place is huge and yet easy to enter and to find your place, which is numbered, so avoiding confusion for people to sit. The stadium has a good structure with many options for snacks and drinks at the entrance.But the basketball in US is more than just a game, it's a whole spectacle. To start with, they gave T-shirt from Clippers to each person, for people to cheer for the team. During the game, each time there is a break called for one of the teams, they bring cheer girls to dance and sometimes also, they bring acrobats to perform. It was even too much for my taste, since the game was interrupted too often. At that night Jack Nicholson and Rhihanna were the celebrities around. It seems that in the games, there are always some celebrities.All in all, it's an American experience to go for a game in the Staples Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuPereira

40,Very nice venue,"The Staples Center is a really great venue. I went for the last home basketball game of the season since LA was playing my hometown team and I was impressed by the center.An easy walk from the Metro Expo Line stop, the Staples Center is nicely situated on a plaza in close proximity to retail shops, eating establishments, and bars. The arena is huge and the staff were quite helpful in regards to finding our seats. As expected for a place of that size, there are plenty of options for food from McDonalds, to the typical hot dog and fries and to more ""upscale"" places such as Ludo Bird, which is where we ate. The prices are of course arena prices for both that place and for the soft pretzel and popcorn that we indulged in a little later in the game.We had great seats and the sound and acoustics in the place were pretty good. Despite the terrible season that the Lakers had, the fans were nonetheless really engaged in the game, which made for an exciting atmosphere. One bonus of going to the last home game of the season is that there are discounts at all of the clothing/souvenir vendors at the arena so we got some memorabilia for relatively inexpensive prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maishar

50,Awesome facility,"Staples Center to me was very historic. So much history with this facility. Whether your attending a Kings, Lakers, Clippers, Sparks game, or a concert, you won't be dissapointed. The concourse was nice and spread out, lot of concessions and food options. Parking wasn't too bad for me, but after I went to a Kings game, the traffic was chaos. Other than the traffic after an event, I loved this facility, highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dstanch2016

30,Ringling Bros. Circus,"We attended the Ringling Bros circus this past weekend. While the event was OK, the whole experience seemed to be a money grab. I paid for Prepaid parking but should have waited as it was cheaper to pay the day of the event. Also the prepaid parking was further away than we had parked in the past.The food was WAY over priced. Bring your own if you can. They do scan for metal at the door so be aware of that. The large soda at $5.25 was more like a Medium at Mcdonalds but you can get the real Large for $7.00 and it is refillable. That is if you can muster waiting in the long line or sit on an aisle seat so you do not have to crawl over everyone. I think they know that no one is going to refill their drinks and they conveniently close before the event is over so you can not get a refill for the drive home. Scam.Aisle seat numbers are 1 on the right and 21 on the left. Try to get somewhere near there if you want easy access in and out. Sections 101, 102 are the best for middle of the arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerrittB

40,Clippers Game,"I was there the last time I visited LA. It is a really nice and apparently safe area. There were some police around and it was easy to buy a ticket. The online deal cost the same as buying the ticket at the ticket box so I went there instead. The place around is full of overpriced paid parking and it is infuriating how it is almost impossible to find free parking in a city where it is compulsory to drive. Inside the centre it was very nice. It was organised, it had proper restrooms and the usual fast food joints. I really had fun watching the Clippers. The only complaint I have is about the seats. The seats are hard and too close to each other. If your ""neighbour"" is overweight (lots of them are in the US...A) and mine was then it is a bit unpleasant because I ended up using half of my hard plastic chair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RicardoB486

40,It's a MUST visit when in L.A.,"On my first trip to LA i thought it was mandatory to see a Lakers game in the famous Staples Center, disregarding the fact that they lost, it wasn't dissaponting. The facilities are modern and accesible. The staff makes you feel like a fan immediately, even if you aren't. The ambient during the game made me realize why the stadiums in America always gets to their full capacity. The souvenir shop has a great diversity and good deals on jerseys.If you visit LA and there's a basketball season in progress, don't miss a game here with a cold beer and some nachos. it's a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EfWilson1

50,Lakers vs Hawks,"I went twice to see the team of my dreams. My advice to the people that have not travel to a NBA game is that they should pay at least $100 more to be on the middle or down in the stadium. Because watching the game from the very top is very poor view.The main attraction is not the game, but the shows.If you assist to a VIP area, arrive early, so you can enjoy the area of restaurants. Their is a Buffe real good. Plus if you can also be outside the stadium, where there are restaurants and other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/668robertot
50,WOW VIP is the best,If you ever get to go and watch a game. try and get a vip suite. This experience is worth it. The views to what you get over it all is just one of the bestest experiences.Here you do have waiting services to which whatever your heart desires you can order over the phone or you can also go and get whatever you would like from the food stores they have available.Seating here is luxury and as I said the views are one of the best house seats in the stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodecirossi
50,Great Venue,"It is a great venue for concerts and Basket-ball games. There is not a bad sit in this arena. If you come early enough, you can find street parking, but otherwise there is parking outside the arena that are cheaper than the actual arena parking lot. You can find parking for $10 the night two blocks from it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pauline2706
50,"Nice concert venue, parking OK","Not thrilled with the parking since there were a myriad of streets colliding and didn't know which one(s) were one-way, etc. around LA. GPS took us in a circle. Finally found a parking structure with small spots and never like to feel trapped but it turned out OK. Staples Center is kind of a sprawling arena with a lot of hype but reminds me of some super dome. Anyway, I loved seeing Patti Smith there when she opened for Morrissey. Great seats we had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OceanS49
50,Great venue,"Even if you have cheap seats you will at least have a view. Easy venue to get to, public transportation dumps you right off at the arena and you are good to go if you don't want to drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betwigg

50,AWESOME venue!,"We are avid KINGS fans and the Staples Center is out hockey home! We've also been here for concerts and the sound quality is very good - not as much distortion as other venues.

20,Great facility...douchey fans,"Went there to see a Kings game. The facility itself is great. Good sightlines, awesome scoreboard and multimedia systems. Good food choices, but ridiculously priced beer.The problem was the ""fans"". Noboy's watching the game. People getting up during play. Talking on cellphones. They don't know the game and they don't care about hockey. Just there to see and be seen.Is it harsh to judge a venue by the fans? Maybe. But if the fans ruin the atmosphere of the venue and the experience of being there, so be it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrWayne

40,Great downtown venue,"I've been to Staples Center several times. It is located in the L.A. Live, the entertainment complex, where many restaurants and attractions take place. Staples Center is a great venue for sports event. It is a large and well organized place. You can still see the center floor fairly well, even if you are on the higher levels. If you are on the floor seat for the live music performance, you might feel a bit frustrated as you are one of many audience on the flat big floor. My small complaint is that they have one escalator area only on one side of this big building. My main complaint is lack of the parking space. You have to plan to spend $10-20 to park your car in the nearby parking areas including the convention center next door. I try to manage by using a public transportation unless I go there with a group of people so that we can split the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venusian2000
50,LOVE IT!,"I like this place for sporting events....Lakers, Clippers, Kings...it has a great vibe and L.A. Live is right beside it and you can spend time there as well.

For sporting events, however, this place is da bomb!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
50,Great arena,"It's a nice place to see a game or a concert. Lots of restaurants nearby, easily accessible by public transportation (which is a miracle in downtown LA).

50,STANLEY CUP HOCKEY IN STYLE,"My first time at Staples Center and here are a few tips for a really fun experience there, whatever you are going to watch. My experience was for a great hockey game between the Kings and the Ducks and I have to say being a Ducks fan I was worried. I found that the LA fans were fun loving, friendly and very cool, which added to my enjoyment of the evening. First off, get there about 2 hours prior to event time, Park right up front for $25.00 (CASH) directly across the street to the Figuroa Entrance. A short walk to HOOTERS for a few resonably priced drinks and a bite to eat (large portions & really good) and relax. From where you sit you can see when the doors open, so you can pay your tab and take a short walk across the street to the event. Afterwards, a quick right turn out of the parking area and you are on your way to the 110 Freeway. Have fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottysgirl01

40,Cool but overpriced!,"Staples Center plays hosts to the Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and many other entertainment events.

50,Nice and LA's best place to visit,"Went yesterday for the LA KINGS (Hockey) vs Anaheim Ducks. I really enjoyed walking around the venue and taking some shots. We came early to do this roaming around and for the parking. Wow, how expensive, the cheapest around the area is $25. The crowd is well behaved as we'rein line to go in. Lots and lots of police patrol cars and motorcycles in every single corner, all the way in Figueroa st, even in fronts of restaurants around the Nokia centre. It's nice to see the giant statue of legends in basketball, which is captured in my camera. It's well worth the visit and i'm solucky my family brought me here and experience this first class gatherings of fanatics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maganda0411

40,The place of LA's BEST,"Want to see the Clippers, Kings, Lakers, Concerts. Here is where to go. The Staples center is a great arena. When it comes to basketball sitting in the raised area of the 100 section all the way to the back of 200 section is great. You're able to see the entire court. In section 300 it's a toss..if you have an HDTV 40 inches or better...just stay at home. Inside of Staples is a place called Ludo Chicken. yummy. Of course it's overpriced to accommodate stadium entertainment.So you ask why not 5 stars? Parking. It's outrageous. and it's always a far walk. If you're not familiar with the staples center and park on the opposite side of where your seats are oh you're in for a long walk. Due to Staples, convention center, Nokia center, club Nokia, movie theater restaurants it's always congested. Don't miss your turn cause if you do you will be stuck trying to get back to where you started from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowbuxlux

20,Upstairs = Nosebleeds,"This place is the arena to see and be seen. Its built for the rich folks who can afford to sit downstairs for the Laker games. So happen the Clippers and Kings play here too. Oh and the WNBA team.The downstairs level is rather deep, and then there's 3 levels of corporate suites. Yes, three! So by the time the cheap seats start, you're already 3 levels higher than the ground level. Kobe Bryant isn't that tall when you're 3 stories high. Imagine a hockey player who averages 6 ft 3.Their food selection, though is good.Parking sucks, and the area around this place is either an expensive place, or a sketchy part of DTLA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle

50,Just Amazing,"Wow, I came here for a Lakers & Clippers game. It like day & night for each game. The arena itself is a marvel to be in, but taking in the work it takes to completely change from one team to another really makes you appreciate the work it takes to run this place. First the Lakers game gives off a very old school feel. They place the lights solely on the court to make sure the focus is on the game. They play music from the organ just like days of old & its very vintage. The Clippers has an atmosphere similar to my experience for a Miami Heat game which is it's very bright, energetic & exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigd413
50,Great basketball atmosphere,"I recently went on my first trip to LA and I made two stops at the legendary staples center for basketball games. I saw the Lakers and the Clippers play on two different nights. The games were back to back so I was surprised to see the signage and displays change overnight from lakers to clippers, very cool! The stadium itself was very cool and in a nice area in downtown.I sat in the premier section seats and was surprised that they had waiters that took your order and served you right at your seat. No need to leave the game unless you need to visit in the restroom! And they use mobile devices to take your order and charge your credit card on the spot. Super easy and convenient!If you're a Kobe fan, you'll be pleased about the specialized store they have for him. They display all his shoes and sell lots of shirts and accessories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waicool

The bottomless soda was OK but I wish they would have stayed open later at concessions so I could have gotten a refill. Parking could be tough if you don't have a pass.

50,Clippers vs Bucks!,"The Staples Center itself is amazing! It's very impressive to see from the outside, but once you're in it seems so much larger! There are bars, restaurants, shops etc. within the building - which is quite impressive. The atmosphere was good, I expect it would be better with the Lakers but we had a fantastic time! The only downside is they don't accept UK driving license for ID, so our good night was marred by that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzJPH

We were in section 314. Didn't need binocs or anything, and I could make out the facial expressions on the player's faces.Of course, snacks and drinks are too much, but we just sucked it up and got a couple of beers to complete the experience.Parking is cheap and easy in the underground parking, or just take a cab.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristopherowens

50,Thanks Staples/Lakers for a Wonderful Memory,"The U.S.A. often gets a bad rap for some of its over-the-top events but here’s one foreigner who couldn’t get enough of the event that accompanied the Lakers V Knicks game on the 25th of March. The stadium itself is a technological marvel but it was the organization and the fans that won me. We immediately felt part of the night when we were given a Lakers towel as we entered the center. Our seats were high up but you had a great view. At every point there was something to see on the huge scoreboard hanging from the roof. Now the game! The Lakers were expected to be soundly beaten but, after a shaky start, they seemed to grow in confidence and enthusiasm – no wonder with their fans being so passionate! At each break, the Lakers Girls entertained with great routines. I have never been a big fan of cheer leaders but these girls sold me. Great to see that they and the whole Lakers organization serve their community. Reading programs for disadvantaged kids, dance instruction from the Lakers Girls, help with building projects – GO LAKERS! At the end of the night, the organization made good on its promise to give each spectator tacos from Jack in the Box if the Lakers won the game and scored more than 100 points. They scored a record 50 points in the third quarter! As a celebration of the win, tinsel was fired from the ceiling.Staples Center and the Lakers – you have won a new Aussie fan. I will never forget the night you put on for me and the 11 year old Aussie Lakers fan who had encouraged me to book the tickets. He is now back at school telling his classmates of the wonders of a night at the Staples Centre watching his favourite basketball team.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973russellc

Great view of the game too-sat in the 200 section and could see everything. Staff were very friendly, and the food selection was good (My daughter, who is gluten-free, was happy to see some gluten free options at the concession). They also sold sushi, which was a nice alternative to the regular sports concession food.A great experience, and an awesome place to go watch hockey!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caribby96

There are lots of food choices, the bathrooms were clean, crowd control was great and we didn't have to fight with traffic because we stayed in the area.

Beware of parking in the lots--prices are subject to going up or down and rarely are they the same each time I go (one time it may be $10 another it may be $25). I asked the attendant why the prices are always changing and she said it depended on what else was going on around Staples Center. Overall it is a great place to see a hockey game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vhockeymoose
40,Pretty good venue,"Saw the KINGS last night. First visit to the Staples center. I see a lot of hockey games. Seating is great. Facilities are very good. Beer offerings are excellent. Weak on the food offerings, however. McDonalds? Really?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucycan
30,didn't have my passport so couldn't get an alcoholic drink,"after 6 weeks of traveling around the US and Mexico we got to LA, the last place before you headed home. it was my friends birthday and she had been looking forward to a really great night watching brooklyn vs the lakers. we go to get some drinks and are denied them because we don't have our passports to prove we are 21..... we are baffled by this! we ask where are we told this and the lady says - on the website (its not on the website I have checked since being home) we go to our seats and start to watch the game and thought we should maybe go and check another bartender and see if the same thing happens... and funnily enough it does! after much frustration i ask the bartender how we were meant to know this... he said 'im not sure but its only the staples center that have this rule' WHY WOULD WE THEN MIRACULOUSLY know to carry around our passport which is of such value with us to a BASKETBALL game...... it really ruined the night especially my friend turning 21 it was so disappointing :( other than that the atmosphere is great fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiam981
50,Clean and Comfortable,Attended a Clippers vs Phoenix Suns game and enjoyed the experience. The facility is clean and the seats are comfortable with a sufficient amount of leg room unlike many venues. Chick Hearn Way is closed off before and after events which allows easy access and egress. We parked in the West Garage and were directed out of the garage and onto the Harbor Freewaqy in record time after the game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonH728
50,L.A Living,Can't go wrong with a laker game and L.A Live to top off a date. Be apart of history when you watch one of your favorite sports teams play at this historical staples center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mignaud
40,Staples!,Huge place for conventions and games! come here during Ski Dazzle and some Laker games! food may be a bit overpriced and restrooms are located all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brunohits
50,Ton of fun!,"I went during the Clippers VS. Pelicans and it was great. By far one of my favorite venues in the US. Not only is it pretty from the outside, but the inside is also very spacious and clean. I am a huge fan, and will be attending more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xlindaas
50,Awesome,The view was spectacular. It's the nicest stadium I've ever been to. The atmosphere was just so lively and fun. We attended a Lakers game and loved it. Would certainly go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilviaD949
30,Fun... but not very accommodating,"We took a group of 8 developmentally disabled adults to a Laker's game. They had a variety of mobility challenges and I informed the group ticket sales person this at the time of the ticket purchase. There were absolutely no accommodations made for our group (either seating-wise) or financially, even though we are a non-profit that benefits disabled folks on limited incomes. We were seated in the very top tier - at the top of a very steep flight of steps - not ideal seating for our group.One of our clients was in a wheelchair and one suffered from vertigo, so neither could sit in our assigned seats. It was quite an ordeal to get them seats in the handicap spaces. They originally wanted to seat them in a whole other section from where the rest of the group was seated and would only allow the two seats for the clients, themselves, no attendant! Even though we brought the clients in to the Guest Services office to ""show"" them the clients, the ladies were still hesitant to accommodate them! They were going to make us present two of our group tickets in exchange for the handicap seats so ""the Laker's can re-sell them."" What?!! Seriously? It wasn't even a sold out game - empty seats all around us! Really? The Lakers aren't making enough money already?Anyway, the clients had a great time and that, ultimately, is the goal. Just sad that a franchise that pays their players millions of dollars can't be more accommodating for their fans, especially those to whom this event was the highlight of their year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellengruetz

50,"Great Location, LA Live!","So the stadium is very well kept, also very modern looking. But almost all NBA stadiums are that way, what I enjoyed best is the surrounding area before and after the game. LA Live is fantastic. Plenty of bars, and entertainment. Awesome people watching, a lot of walks of life and ""only in LA"" situations.The opening act with the huge curtain was pretty impressive, only second to the Bulls in Chicago!Great time. It seems that Jack Nicholson never misses a game, he was there. Only thing is that the rockets beat the Lakers by more than 30 points :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ORD-TGU

50,Awesome time at the basketball,"The atmosphere at the Lakers Vs Cavs game was like no other sporting event we'd experience at home, it was epic! Admittedly our seats were 10 rows back from the floor. Remember to take your passport if you want to drink! We only had Australian drivers licenses, but were lucky enough to be seated next to some friendly doctors who wanted to shout us the whole night =D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alishaaarobinson
50,It so fun!,"We saw a Lakers game and it was so fun! We had seats all the way up, but still you can see everything very good, plus they have huge screens. You can buy food/drinks and enjoy while watching the game. Totally recomendable for all the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuateRider_650
50,Great Seats!,"I have been to the staple center several times for NBA games, WMBA and concerts. Each time I've been lucky enough to have floor seats, however, a few times I've sat farther up and still have to say I was able to see everything at the stage. The staff keeps everything organized as far as checking tickets for entry and seating. Overall, I've had great experiences here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496ericas

The broadcast support staff are consummate professionals. I always enjoy working at Staples!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duckfisney
40,LA 2014,"Large and clean facility. This place is well organized for its size. The day I was there I attended an expo and there were many other events going on at the same time. While I am sure there were thousands of people there, I never felt crowded or overwhelmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WedsChild
50,Up there with the best,"On this trip we've been to a few great indoor stadiums, Consol in Pittsburgh, Madison Square Garden and Staples. For ease of access, cleanliness, sight lines, concessions and wow factor, Staples wins. We were there for a Kings game and the activity/entertainment off the ice kept the atmosphere great even in the breaks in play. Can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhN5574ZN
50,Out of this world,Made it to the Lakers vs Heat game on christmas day. Coming from Australia we have nothing like this. I was amazed by everything from the court to the way the stadium was built.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamInAus88

40,Kings vs Flyers,"Gorgeous arena! Long lines for concession. Be careful your in the correct line as they do not have good signage. Some of the people working in concession were rude, but the ushers were fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
50,Amazing experience,"We saw the LA Clippers vs Denver Nuggets which ended up being a whitewash. It didn't matter though, it was a great experience and well worth it. I think we picked up tickets for around $30 each and the view was pretty good. Great entertainment throughout, including dunking contest, DJ and American national anthem. We drove in and paid $10 for parking I think and it didn't seem too complex for us. The stadium is well managed with professional staff. Puts Australia to shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmO6405MS
50,Kings vs. Pens,"I got my boyfriend tickets to the recent LA Kings vs. Pittsburgh Penguins game and I have absolutely no complaint about the experience! We parked in event parking which was right across the street for $20. We weren't going to chance running around other areas trying to find parking and it worked out just fine. We got tickets that were ""VIP"" so we were able to enter the arena before most could and the staff was so welcoming and friendly, even if we were for the opposing team. I would recommend buying seats in the VIP section - you are basically at a restaurant since there are designated workers who ""serve"" you and take your order. This is so convenient and less disrupting for those around you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katew83
50,Clippers vs Minnesota Timberwolves at Staples,"This is our 2nd visit for 2013. Staples Center has everything you can ask for when watching a game or concert. They have great selection of food outlets or restaurants from food court, lots of beverage outlet for beers and sodas and a buffet restaurant where you can enjoy the foods while watching a game or concert.During the basketball game, Clippers foundation auctioned some items signed by the players. I think this is a nice project for raising money to help the community and for the fans to get an authentic souvenirs signed by their favorite player or players.Restrooms here are clean and well supplied.The staffs are friendly and helpful, whenever you need an assistance or directions.Parking across the street price is $20 and it's a bit cheaper when you go further.There are lots of cops assisting the traffic in and out the Center area, that make it easy for everyone attending an event.I'll suggest to come at least an hour before any event to get a nearby parking and get to your suite or seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonip548

20,check the information,I went around here to visit the Grammy museum closed to staples center. and I wanted to shop something like official lakers goods after that. but they had hockey games on that day so I couldn't even enter the shop and buy anything. so you should check store information if you plan for visiting there only to shop something.But I'd like to visit there someday to watch NBA games!! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayaaan131
50,Lakers on Christmas day!,"We saw the Lakers play on Christmas day, it was an amazing Center and great atmosphere. We sat mid tier and had a great view of the game. We also attended an Ice Hockey game which was one of the best experiences. The Center has plenty of food outlets and is opposite Nokia Plaza, which over the Christmas period had an outdoor ice rink and huge Christmas tree. Loved LA, loved the NBA and NHL at Staples!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma_S_Aus77

40,Lakers game anyone?,Come on you can't go to LA and not see a Lakers game!! This was an experience that was enjoyable as we love a good game. The atmosphere and energy was great. The coliseum was smaller than others however our seats were very close to the floor which was a big plus. We could see celebrities in their dedicated seats which was also fun! Another great opportunity for photos. Great halftime show as well. Worth the time and money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bankerchic77
50,All decked out for the Rolling Stones!,"We have been here many times. Usually we just get a room near by to get there early and avoid the parking and crowds. It's good to be relaxed before a show/game and not stressed about the parking and crazy drivers.Once we got inside, the level we were on was all decked out in Rolling Stones decor for the show and Staples had special food courts and bars set up. It was very nice and we felt like we were in a special venue. For the price of Stones tickets I guess we were! The whole area around Staples is nice and well done.If you are not from Southern California, go see a show or game here and stay in the area to avoid driving prior to showtime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
50,Great venue for concerts!,"During a trip to LA last summer I went to a concert at the Staples Center. What a great facility! There are a ton of nice food and drink options, plus it's nice and bright and visually pleasing inside. Sound was very good and the staff was helpful. It was a major plus that it was in the center of LA Live. Loved having fun places to go after the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelchick576
30,Parking was a nightmare,"I was there for a convention, we had to walk about a 1/2 mile each way because we couldn't find a place to park. The center was OK once you are inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwo911turbo
50,LA Kings hockey game,"My son and I attended LA KIngs hockey game (vs. Boston Bruins). Kings won 4:2 !! GO KINGS !!We bought parking tickets in advance (section 1, VIP), which right next to the Center and about 2 minute walk away from the main entrance. We purchased game tickets in advance also.Entrance logistics were smooth and without huge crowds. The Kings store with memorabilia and check-out registers got a bit busy and crowded before the game started, but the staff handled it efficiently and quick.I wish I could say the same about gate and service staff (on various levels and in various functions). We got two tickets to the Wells Fargo Chairman Room from one of Kings players (thank you so very much again Anze !!). It took us about 1/2 hour of being sent into all different directions before we were finally directed to the right part of the stadium to find the Room. For future Chairman Room visitors - it is underneath the stadium (under section 105) next to the players dressing rooms.Overall it was a great experience and everything went more or less smoothly. The entire game was an unbelievable experience. Kings and Stadium crews provided for a lot of entertaining moments, as well as for a very safe and pleasant 3 hour game stay.GO KINGS !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zuro
50,You can see the atraction (and well) from anywhere!,"Everything very organized, people helping everywhere, taking orders from the seats (you don't need to get up to pick anything to drink or eat).

40,Great for Hoops,"I've been to a lot of arenas and the Staple Center is great for watching basketball. A bit too large for concerts, not as intimate. If you want to see famous people, you will see the most at a Lakers game. We spent the money and got 8th row seats and can not even list the number of stars you see there just walking around. The concourse is very large and the lines are never that bad.Park around 9th and Georgia. Less crowded when the event ends and there are on ramps for the freeway right there to take you anywhere you need to go quickly (unless it's 5PM and then the freeways will take you anywhere very slowly).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166ToddS
50,Awesome atmosphere,At the guidance of my hotel I bought the tickets through Stub Hub. Easy process. The Center is located next to a lot of pubs and restaurants. Loved the atmosphere although tix were expensive. A must do while in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adrewbryant
40,Famous stadium,I went there once while staying in San Diego to watch Clippers against Oklahoma. Interesting and nice building from the outside as well as from the inside.

Was great to have someone come and take our food and drink orders throughout the game. Very friendly service. Food delicious - popcorn, carnitas nachos, cheeseburger. Had parked the car in Lot C which was a short walk to the arena. Only problem was on the way out, we got lost and didn't know how to get back to the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvhb4evr

Great location, comfortable seats, friendly staff, everything you need to watch a Kings good game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/v_noda
50,My sons first concert,This place was amazing. I took my son to his first concert here to see Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. Everything about this place made it an experience we will never forget. I felt safe with it being just my son and I because there seemed to be security all over. I would definitely go back again!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovejones69
40,Lakers Heaven!,Liked: Very fan friendly. Lots to do for all ages.Disliked: Parking. Seemingly lack of open security and distance to be walked from parking lots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1fyneday
40,Vibrant. Action. Well organized.,"We went to see a match of the LA Clippers. Prices for seats are not cheap. We paid $150 per person. But it's great fun to experience the NBA feeling. The hall is impressive and so is the show around the match. The organization is fluent. I ordered tickets from home in Europe, which have to be picked up a special booth. This all went very fluent. The entree went smoothly and fast. Only downside is the prices for a drink inside. Absurdly expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dirkaarts
50,Lakers!,"I guess my biggest thing about the Staples Center, LA Live, and Convention Center area is probably the parking. It depends on what event you're attending and the time. I highly suggest parking 3 blocks away from where ever you're going and pay the cheaper parking price.Or you can get dropped off or take the metro and walk the 10 minutes to the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
40,NBA games,"Went there for Lakers Game. The entrance is faster than I thought, and really big place, just lakers didn't win that night, audience left before the game ends which I think it's a little disrespectful to players.

50,Loved it!,"Saw a Lakers game and had a great time. When staying in downtown LA, you can walk to the Staples Center and grab drinks at the many nearby bars.

And we got free tshirts at the game - bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexShelli
40,Basketball on top level,This is the home arena for the two basket teams in Los Angeles. Here can you see both Clippers and Lakers and the facilities is excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LudvigR

50,My Home Away From Home,"As an LA Kings season ticket holder I spend many nights each year in Staples Center. I also travel a great deal and have been to Sports Arenas around the country. For me none of them combine the atmosphere and the people watching opportunities as well a Staples Center does.First the arena is still state of the art relative to seating and electronics even if it is getting a little older. The people who work there are wonderful. From ushers to concession staff I've never had a bad experience. Staff are generally friendly and helpful at all times.Parking around Staples is easy with numerous small lots available and because there is no one huge parking structure getting away after a game is a snap even in LA.Finally the atmosphere around the arena with LA Live across the street , the numerous restaurants nearby and the pretty much uniformly great weather makes a trip to Staples a great night out all year long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bccrab
40,Great atmosphere!,We watched the Lakers beat the Kings there. Being our first NBA game it was great. Everyone is either cheering or booing or chanting. So much energy in the stadium!You could even send sms messages to the number on the big screen and it would display it in turn.We also saw Red Foo and Zach Galifianakis there too that night. A great night out for the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConfusiousGuy

10,an arena,it's an arena. Big deal. If you get a seat in a luxury box it doesn't include anything else. We got there and they pointed us to concession stands downstairs where we could stand in line for food and drink. No service unless it's arranged days ahead of time. terrible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedml

40,LA Clippers Game,"We went to see a Clippers game last week and had a blast!! A must do if you are going to LA. Beware, food in the arena is extremely expensive as well as parking ($20-$25). Additionally the restaurants in the surrounding area are all very high end..if trying to stay on a budget plan on eating beforehand. I found tickets to the game on eBay (paid $20 total) and was in section 304..and they were great seats! There is not a bad seat in the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/945JulieS945
40,"Great for a game, bad for eating","Food and drink are overpriced. Food, in particular, is very average, even for an arena. My best suggestion for food is to go a little early and eat at one of the restaurants at L.A. Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinAlan
50,Everyone must go to see the LA Kings! Section 209 is the best,The Staples Center is amazing and a must for any hockey fan. I always like to sit in section 209 because the fans are always loud and fun. Kings fans are also friendly and have fun talking to visiting fans so don't be shy if you're cheering for a visiting team. The Staples Center is a class act and a great place to see a game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian
50,VIP Treatment,I came in town to see the AVS KINGS game and it was my first time ever at Staples Center. We sat on the premier level and the service was quick as ever. I've been to many games in many cities and the worst part is waiting 25 minutes for a drink. Not here the place was packed but well ran. We had access to the Chairman's Room which was so cool. Down close to the Ice and the full VIP treatment. Thank you to the staff and the people who work for the Kings. James Cefaly Kelly Cheeseman you have a class organization and a great building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenT407

40,Nice Stadium but nothing like Madison Sq Garden,"Before I went to the Staples Centre I had already been to Madison Square Garden in NYC. The two are similar only Madison Sq is in much better condition, its newer and view is better and there is more room. Dont get me wrong I still enjoyed my experience at the Staples Centre watching the LA Lakers play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotelier2407
30,set up for the extraction of your resources,"Everything about this place is set up to extract dollars from you. If you buy a ticket to see something here, you're a captive of the venue, and you will pay dearly.Start with $28 for parking, and that's not for big events, it's just the run-of-the-mill everyday parking cost. If you must come here, park somewhere else and spend $1.50 on the Metro trains, which run late into the night.The LA Live zone outside the stadium feels like the worst possible combination of Las Vegas and a strip mall. Despite being an outdoor pedestrian space, it still feels like it was built to withstand major riots (which admittedly do happen in LA from time to time) with blast doors, steel shutters, metal detectors to go into the venues, overpriced bars restaurants, and way too many people hanging around with nothing to do -- because there is nothing to do here except go to your concert or sporting event, which you should do posthaste and avoid the rest of it.Eat and drink downtown or on Hollywood Boulevard before or after you come here, but don't spend any more time here than necessary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dagmaragogo
50,Fun sports and concert hall in Downtown LA,Have seen many shows and sporting events at the Staples Center. Home of the LA Lakers and the spot for many larger touring productions. Easy parking and many places to dine in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,"""State of the Art""","I was here for WWE Summerslam 2013. What's not to like? Eating places all over the places,well-maintained VIP suites, good security, good proximity to public transport and walkable from hotels in downtown LA. All the Laker banners hanging from the rafters gave a good nostalgic backdrop too, especially for the basketball-crazy minion in me. Layout of the arena was excellent. The acoustics, perfect. Such was particularly evident given that I was there for a sports-entertainment event. Would definitely go back for concerts, sporting events, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MigiCortez

50,Lakers Game,"Great seats, well designed. Easy to see the game from every seat. Plenty of parking all around the area. no waiting to park, no walking to leave after the game. Lots of variety of foods. I had sushi $16.50 but worth every bite. Generous portion, soft fresh flavorful fish. Plenty of bathrooms. No walking for miles, no waiting in lines! Great game. Fun, fun, fun! I recommend a visit to the Staple Center whenever you are in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosalie1836
30,La Lakers vs Timberwolves.,"Went to a Lakers game. Was very easy to get to on the Metro. Well signed, cleaned and tidy. Food is reasonably priced, having a McDonalds inside is a great idea. Loads of places for merchandise to be purchased. No warning that you can't take certain cameras in etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwikorie
30,For NBA Fans,"This is part of my bus tour in LA. A remarkable place for sports fan, espeically basketball. There are statues and small monumemts outside on the square. I did not get in, just wandering around, A ""must"" for me. I met some teeangers. They showed great interest in this stadium and they seemed to be frequents. I was a Lakers fan back in the 70s and this short visit was definitely kind of pilgrimage. I found shining faces with bright smiles as they passed me by.Somehow, the spirit was contageous. Great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neverlandalice

50,Home away from home.,"We are huge Kings fans and love going to Staples to watch games. One of the best arena's out there. Always clean, every seat has a cup holder-even in the nosebleed level, nice staff, good times. Love everything about this arena. You will definitely have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFinals
40,Hockey and great seats,"The Staples center is just one of those places you have to visit at least once in LA, even if you are not a sports fan. When I went, we had wonderful seats to see a hockey game along with junk food and good beer. You can not beat the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wearecured
50,"Loved the Staples Center.....however, don't pay for parking on ticketmaster","I am not a basketball fan at all but since moving to California last year I've been able to cross alot of things off of my bucket list. If you don't have a bucket list you should definitely make one. Going to an LA Lakers game and to Staples Center was on my list and I killed two birds with one stone this past weekend which was also my birthday weekend. They lost and the team hero, Kobe Bryant, didn't play because he had surgery but I had fun. We went to the Regal cinemas to see a movie. That is located on the other side of Nokia Theater. The matinee prices are outrageous so be prepared for that. The theater itself is huge though!! I bought my Lakers tickets online from ticketmaster the day they went on sale. I didn't buy parking tickets because I had read reviews on here that said not too and I'm so glad that I listened to those reviews. On ticketmaster they had parking tickets on sale for no lower than $25 I believe it was and the parking area for those tickets is near Blaine St which is about a half mile walk behind Staples Center and you have to walked under the bridge where the 110 freeway passes. I took my chances and arrived early that day so I could tour the area around Staples Center and parked DIRECTLY across the street from Staples Center for only $10. You can't get any better than that. It is a privately owned parking lot and it is huge. I noticed all of the other parking lots around that were reserved for the Staples Center were not open yet and the signs posted all had prices twice as much as what I paid to park. So if you're reading this review DO NOT PAY FOR PARKING ON TICKETMASTER FOR THE LAKERS GAME. My son and I will be back on Christmas day to watch to Lakers play the Miami Heat. Like I mentioned earlier I'm not a basketball fan but hey I have no other plans for Christmas and my relatives all live on the east coast where I'm from and going to Staples Center sounds like it will be fun to see two rival teams play plus maybe Kobe Bryant will show up and I'll get to see both him and Lebron James play. That'll be awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BridgetSmith4
50,Great game,"Our first professional basketball game and it was very exciting, can't really compare it to any others but we had fun. It was not too expensive, very crowded but overall a good night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodgerskay
40,"Great venue, parking a bit confusing","Attended WWE Summerslam 2013 in August. Venue was great, amazingly comfortable inside considering the heat on the day. Lines moved ok to get in (event was sold out) and very efficient to get out. Had pre-booked parking (I assume a rookie error) and it was very hard to find my lot, which was not as close as some of the unofficial lots around for the same price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speake53

40,Enjoyable evening watching Kings hockey,"The stadium is a perfect fit for center city Los Angeles. Not a bad seat in the lower levels. The upper level appears to have too much pitch, but this is common with the newer type of stadiums. Not up to par with an Air Canada Centre, but close to the top otherwise in sports venue arenas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amacwow
50,Opening Night,"There is nothing to say but WOW to the Staples Center. We caught opening night of the LA Clippers basketball vs the GS Warriors (a win at home for the Clippers). Besides the Clipper Band, the Spirit Team and the players, the dynamics of the atmosphere was incredible. The surrounding plaza area outside the arena is filled with great shops, restaurants and bars. Inside the area, fun venues, bars and more food. Never a lack of eating and drinking. The folks in charge have their plans and are fully equipped to take care of thousands of folks out for the game or whatever venus is offered there (also home to the LA Kings and the LA Lakers and concerts etc.). A wonderful time. (Oh yeah, always a chance of seeing some Hollywood celeb!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReenL
40,Concerts and sporting events,We have Clippers season tickets so we attend regularly during basketball season. We also attend several concerts throughout the year. This venue is good for both. We usually stop to eat before we get there. The food and drinks are very expensive. The parking fees range from $20-$30 for the closest lots depending on who is performing/playing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhonniH
40,prepay parking,"You can prepay parking directly from the Staples website. This will save you lots of time, as the line is separate from non-prepaid cars. Food and drinks are very expensive as one would expect, but there are tons of eateries in the area. The location is very close to the 110 freeway entrances, so getting there is easy. Dealing with the zillions of people leaving at once is a bit crazy, so take the redline train if you can. The 7th/Figueroa stop is just a few blocks from Staples center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808stays
50,Staples Center,Although the parking can be tricky the Staples center is a fabulous place to see sporting events or concerts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njcrocker
50,Great Venue,"I Attended a LA Lakers Pre-Season game and a LA Kings game here and I thought the stadium was amazing! I am an international traveller so I purchased my tickets online and then had to pick them up at Will Call and I was a bit nervous as to whether this would be an annoying process but it was super easy. A gentleman working there directed me to the correct window and I picked up my tickets and is was as easy as ever. We parked right across from the stadium and it cost $20.00. They have plenty of bars and food options in the stadium also. Must say the hockey was way better to watch than the Basketball, it just had an awesome atmosphere and the crowd were so hyped up it was awesome. Basketball could really get rid of the KissCAM it just makes people feel awkward and scared that the camera will come onto them :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiddelywinks
40,Great venue for it all :),"Hold Laker season tickets for six years now.Great venue, seats are comfortable. staff is professional and friendly.Large selection of food and drinks , it's over priced but that's to be expected.Parking in the area can also be way overpriced.It is an expensive experience but well worth the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kerensh

40,Lakers Rogers Waters at Staples Center,"This is a great venue for just about anything. I have seen several Lakers games here, and have no complaints except perhaps the ease of departure. Driving home after an event can be very time consuming. There may be one, but I would love to see a shuttle that takes you well out of the traffic zone after an event. I say Roger Waters perform The Wall here and it was epic. Even though I had nosebleed seats for that concert, I could still see very well. Food and beer was quite expensive, but that is usually to be expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmT2538FV
40,Attended many events here,It is so easy to commute to the Staples Center on the light rail. The facility is user friendly even when there is more than one event taking place at or around the same dates and times. I like the variety of exhibitions and conventions which are held here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/995drw

40,"Perfect for businesses, large or small","The facility is beginning to show some wear, but overall it is a wonderful place for business conventions. There are a wide variety of rooms, small to large, to accommodate any size meeting or conference. Staff is always available to direct you if you get turned around in the enormous facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andi63
40,Nice venue with surrounding area to visit,The Center was nice and orderly to enter and exit. When a group of women wanted to harass some people during our concert it was dealt with swiftly and they were escorted out. Parking was easy in and out with a garage across the street and personnel to aid. There is a food and and shops in the area adjoining the Staple Center so go to your venue early. Once inside bathrooms are clean and the level we were on had a night club setting which was nice for a few cocktails before the concert. The food was good but of course venue pricing. Nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justjoe2
40,P!nK Rocks the Staples Center,"I've only been to Staples once, to see P!nk and it was awesome. Aside from the concert, Staples was pretty cool too. There are a lot of restaurants, though get there early we faced 1-2 hour waits, and a pleasant place. The staff were friendly and the seats were good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkipperM
40,See an event at the Staples Center,"My best friend (a local) treated me to tickets to see Depeche Mode (one of my favorites) on October 2, 2013. Wonderful concert and we did have incredible seats close to the stage.Re: the venue: there are lots of bathrooms so do not stop at the main entrance; keep walking around to the next one since there usually isn't a line (there was a long one at the main entrance; we walked less than a minute to our right and there wasn't a line to enter).Prices for food and drink are pretty expensive but we ate on the way to the concert so we avoided that unpleasantness.Souvenirs for the event weren't priced too awfully (I've seen a lot worse).Exiting from the garage took a lot longer than we ever anticipated; perhaps we missed signs but we needed to circle around in order to get on the road that we wanted.Would go to another event there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BZM_13
40,LA Kings V NY Rangers,Went to see the Kings get beat by the Rangers recently in a very entertaining game. Centre is excellent great views and good food and drink service.

40,ottawa vs kings,loved the staples centre - pretty expensive though for concession drinks - 2 beers and 3 wines (horrible wine) - $49 US - yikesonly got the third cup of wine because a full one was knocked over by a fan - ate before attending the game so can't comment on the food - the seats we had were in the 109 secton - really good. got heckled from young drunk fans behind us because we were Canadian - whatever - had a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badweather
40,"Awesome acoustic, economy class seats","Every time i go to staples center for an event (concert or sports) i feel the same. The sound is just incredible and the seating always tight that i feel like I'm in a economy seat on a plane.One of my events i purchased parking with, which turned out to be quiet far away, lot c, for 15 when you actually can get across the street for that same amount if you arrive on time or a bit ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragdias

40,Good arena,"I was here to attend Taylor Swift's RED tour. The indoor arena is big and well-organized. The staff are friendly. It has strict, airport-style security, and no camera is allowed (other than your smartphone). The bathroom is clean. I had no problem finding a taxi back to my hotel after the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yinhh
40,Hyde Club at Staples,Ive been to numerous events at Staples but I had yet to experience a night like I did last week. I was surprised by a friend who invited me to see Depeche Mode for my birthday and took me to the Hyde Club inside the Staples Center. I looks like they took about 5 or 6 skyboxes and knocked out the walls to make a sizable lounge environment complete with DJ and all. We had 2 seats right on the railing with a great view of the stage. The seats also came with food and drink credits so it was nice to be able to order a Manhattan from the bar as opposed to concert beers. I will surely be viewing future concerts or games this way. It would be really fun to go in a large group and it looks like they offer table service as well to larger parties. When the concert was over we ended up staying and dancing to disco for about an hour as they didn't kick anyone out and closed curtains to enclose the room. All in all a great time was had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nvhernandez
50,Great venue in LA,"We had an unbelievable experience with the show Red Tour performed by Taylor Swift. The venue was full of vibrant people, but the access and the exit of the show was very well organized without any confusion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruijorge190

50,Unbelievable night at Staples Center,"We were visiting LA in July and were very lucky to get to see Beyonce while we were there! She put on the most incredible show, as expected, and the venue itself only added to the experience. very easy getting in and out with staff super organised and lots of places to eat around the area including wolfgang puck, katsuya, starbucks etc. we chose to eat in Wolfgang Pucks place which was fab! the atmosphere both inside and out was electric and we found getting to the venue easy enough on the metro. really enjoyed my night at Staples Center. It would be nice to catch a basketball game there sometime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gillathethrilla
50,No bad seats.,Saw LA Sparks play in September. Great centre and great atmosphere. Sat near Jack Black so be prepared to see a celebrity.

50,Awesome venue,"We were fortunate to be in LA for the Usher closing night concert and were able to get premium tickets at a great price. Akon and Tiny Tempur were the opening acts. It was absolutely awesome.The vibe and atmosphere outside the Staples Centre was electric. The very best concert I've ever been to. Sound and lighting during the concert was phenomenal.

I had a business meeting in a box, and food and drinks were served all night, while having the privacy and comfort to stand, talk, or sit. The dessert was fabulous too.

50,Who doesn't love Staples Center?!!!!,"This place is really in the heart of Los Angeles, this is your number #1 place to take visitors to see the real LA! when there's a game this place is crazy! In a good way though, the Staples Center itself is gorgeous, very nice! It's in a very walkable part of downtown, during winter (or what LA considers a winter) there's an awesome outdoor skating rink and tree, and carnivals., which is great to visit once your game lets out! I love going here for the hockey games! They're affordable, much more so than seeing the Lakers, and they have great restaurants surrounding the center (Rock N Fish is great, there's also ESPN, Yard House, Flemings, Wolfgang Puck is the only one which I would steal clear of) there's a movie theatre and lucky strikes bowling alley and bar right near there (I recommend trying lucky stripes it's very cool, fun, clean, and good drinks!) plus several cool bars and pubs. All in all, it's a great experience and an awesome place to entertain company!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305ashleym

50,Great Venue,"This is a great venue and it is amazing how quickly they can convert it from a concert to a hockey or basketball game. I love attending things at this venue but would not make it a destination alone.

40,Venue is beautiful!,"So, we were here for the P!nk Concert in February 2013. It was our first visit, so we had some questions. There were several entrances to the venue and we just didn't know where to go. No signs directing us. We asked a few 'door attendants' for some direction as to where we were suppose to go according to our tickets and NO ONE knew. And when we did get some answers, they were completely different from the other guy.Just seemed like no one was on the same page. I wonder if they have a pre-shift meetings before each event and go over pertinent information.But, the concert was great! The Staples Center is beautiful. I will definitely attend another event here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2liau
30,A Really Big Venue,"Been there lots of times for Hockey Games and a few concerts. The good is that pretty much every seat has a good view, considering how huge the place is. The bad is that unless you are in the ""Premium"" 200's you are so scrunched up against the person to the right or left of you that you wish you were seated instead in the economy cabin of United. And that's pretty close!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayB23
40,"Right in the Downtown Area, Try To Reserve Parking Somewhere in the Area First","This is a great venue for all kinds of events. The VIP glass booths are a great place to sit and they are set high up and at a kind of steep rake; they're also pricey but worth it! Otherwise, seating here is pretty good everywhere depending on your budget. There are lots of screens to help with viewing, if you are seeing a popular event and could only get seats way up in the crow's nest or something. We definitely suggest reserving your parking ahead of time. It doesn't have to be at Staples Center. There are other places very close by that offer online reservations as well, which is a must if you don't want to drive all over looking for parking or pay an exorbitant fee!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewindatourfeet

Which arena can say that they hosted the 5 NBA championship in the first 10 yrs of opening? A NHL title banner was hoisted a year ago. No other arena can say that they've hosted the Michael Jackson Memorial or the Grammy's award.It is a magnificent facility to watch games. The Lakers are historic, the Clippers are coming around, and the Kings have been great lately; must see either when in the LA area.There are lots of food oulets, restaurants, and bars inside the venue, but overpriced as expected.

50,What a great D'town area,"The area is greatly improved and there are so many restaurants, hotels, activities for the whole family. During the holidays there is outdoor ice skating and the place is decorated to the Nines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamC608
40,One Stop Shop,"Staples is better for sports than concerts in my opinion. I've been there many, many times for both, and there always seems to be something just a bit off with the sound system for concerts. Would I attend another concert there? Sure, if it were someone I wanted to see.As the home of the LA Clippers, Kings, Lakers, and Sparks, Staples Center has seen me plenty of times, and continues to earn my business. The works I've encountered throughout the years have always been pleasant, and the addition of LA Live across the street has made the area even busier, but also provided great eating opportunities prior to events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine80312
50,Best arena for Basketball on the West Coast!,"Each NBA season this venue is a must-visit to see a LA Lakers NBA game. The pricing can be quite expensive + food & drinks, so if visiting it might be best to see a less popular team... Highly recommended venue with great history and an awesome place to watch NBA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryj523
30,Women's Basketball,"First it was very difficult to find out where to park because another event was taking place. We ended up driving around and around until we found it, we were given incorrect parking information.The center itself compared to other places I have been seem to be cheap and in need of renovation. The seats had no place to put cups so drinks got knocked over easily.Just not as clean as I expected it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wo550
40,Good venue for a concert!,"I don't understand why seats behind the stage were sold (upper level), those poor people couldn't see anything. Other than that, the Staples Center is a good venue for concerts. Lots of places to eat or drink all within a walking distance. Food and drinks inside are crazy expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0mmelB
40,good venue in central LA,"Hi I have been fortunate to see meny gigs all over the world I fount the staples center in LA easy to get to, we had cheap seats but still had an excelent view. The bars however are not cheap. I hate venues taking the **** over bar prices. That aside the one thing I would note is that you are not permited enrty with an Ipad or ipad mini.They let us in because we were from Scotland......Thanks mr security man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bjorn_Toulose

40,Nice place to view concerts,I like how everything is layed out to where you can get to things. Parking fees can be astronomical and the beer is pretty expensive. Still the beer is cheaper that the Greek theatre or other places that we've been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillR256

50,Brilliant!,"My partner always follows the NBA season so when we knew we were going to LA the first thing he wanted to do was go to a Lakers game. I was a little nervous at first not knowing what to expect but I had the best night/experience ever! The Americans know how to put on a good show and I would tell anyone to go to a basketball game. The Staples Center and the surroundings is brilliant. Restaurants and bars to grab a bite to eat and if you do got for something to eat, check the yard house, massive place but the staff are brilliant and food is delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chunk1985
50,Staples Center,The home of the LA Kings. Not a bad seat in the house. Good seats can be purchased from the club or Stub Hub.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markp0298
50,Great Venue,Its hard to say there is a bad seat in that house. The stadium has different set ups for different sporting and musical events but I have yet to find a bad seat in the joint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyisMe

30,Not much atmosphere,"We were there on a weekday so there wasn't much atmosphere there, maybe at the weekends there is. Seems to be a lot of nice restaurants there that we didn't get to try. The cinema is just around the corner which is handy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RegMaC88

40,Costly but Worth It,"Worth it depending the event, have seen concerts here but most recently a couple months back a Lakers game. It lives up to the hype, the showmanship, the flash, the arena is upkept well. The food is high cost but everything is high cost at a laker game. If you are a true fan nose bleeds arent at all bad to watch a basketball game but if you want the full experience you will have to fork over a couple extra dollars too get in the bottom bowl and its worth it at least once. Maybe next year Lakers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39RyanF39
40,Excellent Complex,The whole LA Live precinct is a real credit to LA. Lots of good food options and hotels to choose from. along with big screens to watch sports action.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melb_aviator
40,A great sporting palace,"A great place to watch sports. I've seen LA Lakers (NBA) and the LA Kings (NHL) here. Great views. I've sat in many different places. If you're from outside of USA then get Premiere seats. You can then order drinks from the waiter rather than needing to take your passport as they are ridiculously strict there (We are both over 21 with Drivers Licenses from our countries but were denied ""all licenses from out of state are not accepted as proof of age"").",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arnosx
50,Concerts here are extra awesome!,I LOVE going to concerts here. I have seen the same bands and artist at a different concert center but when I see them at staples center it's usually always the best concert. I think it's because it's in LA and thats where the artists and bands usually live so they always play an amazing show here and go all out. So my husband and I stopped going to concerts in our hometown in san diego and started going to concerts here and man we are never disappointed and it's always worth it. It's always a blast here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieWol
40,"Great arena, decent food, for sports or concerts","Safest place in town lots of professional teams to chose from basketball and HOCKEY. The Stanley cup Champion Kings. Food choices are large, service is friendly. Levy restaurants runs the joint so it runs smoothly. Always fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AARDVARKKILLER
50,Clippers/Celtics,"Flew out to LA to see the Clippers/Celtics game and had an awesome time, although my Celtics were destroyed by the Clips. The atmosphere was lights out and my wife and I had a great time. There is plenty to do around the arena. I highly recommend viewing a game at this arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D0nteT
50,Go Kings Go!!,"Staples center is a beautiful arena. Of course when you go to a sporting event you expect to pay for parking and food that can be over priced. I usually sit in the premier VIP section or a suite which parking is included and VIP entrance. The food is also better, made to order. Their is a resturant too you can eat at. The team la store is always packed so make sure to head out early and lots of traffic too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeremyfeldman
40,Great Place to watch a concert,We saw the Rolling Stones here in May 2013. This place was great. Easy access to our seats and easy access to restrooms. Drinks were averaged price and food was inexpensive as well. And The Rolling Stones sounded GREAT!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthTexanGirl
50,Beautiful High Tech Sports Venue,"I have been to numerous Lakers games and other events over the past several years and this is certainly one of the best sports venues in the country. The inside of the Staples seems covered in neon lights with a great sound system. Really excellent giant four-way TV screens over the game adds to the enjoyment. Good bar and food concessions. Parking across the street is a little high at $25 but VIP parking is over $100. Beautiful bronze statues of the Laker greats surround the entrance. The area around the Staples is also very cool with restaurants, Nokia Center, theaters, bars and lots of neon lights. This area of downtown has been completely redone and really looks good at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmhersh
30,"Nothing to see here, unless you have tickets for an event.","Don't bother going to the Staples Center just to see it. It would be more fun to go to a Staples shop. But if you have tickets, that could be quite different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silkroadworker

50,Staples Center,We went to the Staples Center to watch a basketball play-off. LA Clippers. It was a great experience the atmosphere was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyR10
50,"Give yourself time to have fun, before a Laker's game","We paid 20 some for parking, but it was worth it. It was close, and getting out didn't take nearly as long as I thought. Fun restaurants, and lots of action going on prior to Laker's game. My son enjoyed getting the Laker's girls autographs of course. The center doesn't have as great of art around it as other athletic facilities...my son tells me that is because it is for several sporting events in one place. The food is expensive...and had I have known, I would have saved my cash and waited until after the game. The locals bring out their grills and sell food that looked and smelled spicy and delicious! FAR better than anything you would get in the center I am certain! I got our Laker's tix through Ticket Exchange...and was a little nervous about it, but it was a great system and worked out great. This was the SOLE reason we came to LA, as an early graduation trip for my son, who is an avid Laker's fan. He soaked up every bit of the atmosphere and loved the game and whole experience.I'm not a sports fan, but I had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBMT
40,Fun experience,Watched an LA Kings game. Atmosphere was great. Tons of food options were available. Remember to take a jacket for the cold weather inside the venue! Fun experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charvinian
30,Parking expensive,"Went to La Live after leaving fashion district its about 1/2 mile away ,They have a lot of resturants and a few stores but parking was 20 $,here s a hint drive down street to office buildings and parking there is 5$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsc2678
30,Good place for game nights or concerts,"Staples center always full of crowed during the season, and good for indoor events. But if you don't attend any of those events, i would think its bored to go there just for city sight. Maybe you might just walk around the center, and take some pictures with NBA star sculptures in front of the Staples Center Store. That's it end of your day at Staples. and the Parking lots next to the Staples Center is kind of expensive to compare with those parking lots located just a few blocks away. The difference can be $10 or more. Some of them will ask about $15 per hour. But most of parking lots have flat rate around $7-$10 per day in LA, or 25 cents per 30 mins in Downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
50,Let's Go Lakers!,"Went to see the Lakers whoop up on the S.A. Spurs.. I love the atmosphere in Staples and with LA Live across the street, seeing an event there turns into an all night outing. Parked outside, directly across the street for $25. Ate sushi before the game. Took pictures in front of the arena with the statues in Star Plaza. Great time for LA fans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RolandM239
50,Basketball and hockey fun,This is definitely a fun place for a concert or sporting event. Being in Los Angeles there is usually something good going on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
30,Average Indoor Arena,"They have a special exhibit right now for the LA Kings and their Stanley cup, but don't get your hopes up, the Stanley Cup is not on display.....though they'll offer to take a picture of you with a PICTURE of it, for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucep460
40,Take a loan for the beer,"Rolling Stones concert and the center is clean, well staffed with friendly employees, lines weren't too long for bathroom or concessions. Sound good for the most energetic, 'old' band in the world and the seats were not uncomfortable. Only complaint, they seriously rip you off on beer, start at $8, but they were 'out', so had to buy beer starting over $10. We expect to pay an upcharge for beer in this type of venue, it just seemed about $2-3 too high. Pretzel was yummy, they have McDonald's in the center and some other options but we didn't have any. Smoking section on 3rd floor was HUGE and had concessions w/ a cool view of LA Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGlimmerTwins
50,Huge fantastic architecture!,"Amazingly huge, love the layout, didn't think the building was going to end. Lots of venues and lots of friendly staff around to keep you from getting lost!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarbeau
50,Basketball and Ice Hockey,Saw the basketball and ice hockey here and it was fantastic. It doesn't say you can't take video cameras in on the ticket and security tried to take it off me the first time we went in. I had to tell them the ticket didn't state it so I didn't know and I would make sure I wouldn't use it. It was lucky they let me keep it in my bag.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krys1224
40,Wonderful resturaunts and movie theaters too:),"LA film fests home turf is a great one. We love that we can grab a coffee, or a really great meal, between films here:) Try Trader Vic's for a world famous (because it was created by them) mai tai and some apps. if you want something quick and tasty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass810651
40,Lakers and Kings Games,"We went to the Staples Center to see an LA Kings game and a Lakers game and thought it was a great venue. It is pretty cold when the hockey is on so make sure you bring the appropriate clothing or else you'll have to buy some merchandise there (like we did lol). For the LA Kings we had seats in the second back row of the entire stadium and still had a great view. The stadium is designed pretty well so you can see wherever you are. For the Lakers game we had premium seating which is perfect as you don't need to get up to get drinks and food, waiters come around to your seats.Both games had a great atmosphere! Surprisingly exiting the stadium is relatively pain free considering the number of people watching a game and taxis are plentiful outside the venue.I'd also suggest getting a hot dog from the street vendors after the game outside the stadium, they are AMAZING.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spazwok
50,Great atmosphere,Saw the Lakers v Golden State and the atmosphere at Staples was fantastic .... better than the Knicks game at Maddison Sq Garden.Lots of selection of food and drinks at typical stadium prices.Drove and parked at LA Live - cost $20 and was easy to get out of at the end of the game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davejlewis
50,Great Spectacle Lakers!!,"We went to watch the Lakers beat the Spurs and had a great time, it was more than a sporting event and was riddled with the typical Americana one might expect fro such an event. The only downside was some loser advising the coach (at the top of his voice) directly behind us.We read that parking was around $25 but we went pretty early and managed to find a place which was $8 for the day which was about 0.5 miles from the staples centre (definitely worth the walk to save $17).We had no issues picking up tickets from Ticketmaster just write down the reservation number and show it to the ticket office.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JakeandNicoline
40,LA lakers,"Went for LA lakers defo something you should see, if your driving parking is $25. International pick up for tickets is no issue",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReefyReef

50,Ice Hockey- Los Angeles Kings Vs Dallas Stars at Staples Centre,"We booked only a few days out and as the Kings are #1 favourite, seats were limited and pricey. But we ended up with seats fairly close to the front and on the half way line. I did notice the safety glass/ plastic ? around the ice and being clear, it does have joins in it which are metal. This could be a consideration when buying tickets as that top of the glass through your line of vision was noticeable, but probably more so for me as I was trying to take photographs. Perhaps lower and closer is better for photos ?? but general viewing it all seems OK. The atmosphere is really neat. The hockey is fast, entertaining, not too many stops compared to other American sports games I have been to see. I really like the little interludes with cam kisses etc etc. Even the ice sweeping girls are fun to watch. The popcorn etc is expensive but you know that before the game and munching on some of that American snack food is half the fun (You can tell I am not from there) Get there on time, we did, but noticed the die hard fans do not like you getting in their way while the puck is in play. If you are late you cannot sit down until there is a little break although they come often. We really loved the experience and definitely will go again when the opportunity arises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz

There are food and drink vendors located all around the venue, with a separate VIP area accessible to people with certain seats.The arena is located next to a large shopping area with restaurants and other shops to keep you entertained before and after an event. There are also a few statues of legendary sports icons outside the arena (Magic Johnson, Wayne Gretzky, etc.).The crowd during the game was amazing! Loud, enthusiastic, and an overall great atmosphere for a basketball game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babyrice

30,Good arena to watch an event,"The Staples Center is by far one of the largest arenas that I've been to. That goes for the prices as well, as even for a nose bleed seat the prices were much more than you would pay elsewhere. That is the biggest shortfall, as it prevents a lot of people from attending too many events. That said, the views are good throughout. If you are in the front rows of some of the sections there is a glass partition to prevent people from falling over by mistake. However the glass is clean and doesn't obstruct the view.There is a big video screen over the court but not all of the screens were not working which affected portions of the crowd. The arena is pretty simple to navigate. There are both stairs and an escalator to take you to the upper floors (The media elevator is available for handicapped personnel). As part of the event I had access to the Lexus Lounge prior to the start of the game and during halftime. Expecting the lounge to be on the extravagant side, I was disappointed as it was very basic.There are concession stands throughout the arena offering the usual overpriced fare. I didn't get a chance to see what different choices were available as I waited until the game was over to eat at one of the restaurants close by.Overall the Staples Center is a nice choice to watch an event, but it is nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wbullseye

The complex between the center and LA Live is very nice with many restaurants. A tip - there are some decent eateries inside the Staples center too. If you just want something to eat, McDonalds (full service) is inside the center! Parking directly across the street from the game was only $20, cheaper than what we pay here in Maryland for a sporting event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenflady
50,Amazing!,"I was lucky enough to get suite tickets to a Lakers game and WOW! This was an absolute amazing expierience. I am not a Laker fan so I got to enjoy the stadium as a fan and I gotta admit its really Hollwood style! Went to the Amex lounge and that was really nice and alot of room to hang out. Also, got to enjoy a steak dinner while watching the game at one of the resteruants.

30,Do I have to Go Back - REALLY?,"It has to be a really really interesting ""something"" for me to want to go back to Staples Center. Parking is complicated and expensive. Concrete floors inside hard to walk - if you have any aches and pains, it will magnify these. Surrounding area - sure don't want to be here after dark. It was a good idea for urban renewal. Please improve parking signage and directions - and lower parking prices. Yikes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waystation_49

40,Blackhawk fan enjoyed the experience,"Even though I am a Chicago Blackhawk fan, I enjoyed being a hockey fan for a night. The Staples Center truly provides an experience starting outside with the music and other marketing activities (Alberta tents, broadcasts). The great weather allows for this unlike cold snowy Chicago. Inside its easy to manuver to find food or your seat. You can also visit the museum where you can see the Lakers, Clippers, and Kings winning history. Kareem Abdul Jabbar portion is very nice. The game was good and you can easily see the fans excitement. Glad I went, but there's still no place like Chicago for a hockey game. : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bauer99
50,Awesome,"We've went to Staples Center 3 times in January for 2 Lakers games and 1 Clippers game. Staples is an excellent venue for basketball (and probably for anything else). The organisation is good, that staff are helpful and the facility is clean.I'd definitely recommend a visit for a basketball game",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firequeen1962
40,Staples Is Easy,"Staples has brought moving large crowds in and out of the arena almost a non-event. Entering and exiting the facility is rather easy, even with security check points. Parking in the parking structure at LA Live is not the best option, so pay $25 and park at the lot on the corner of Figueroa and Chick Hearn. The arena staff is professional and Stapes itself looks pretty good considering all of its use over the past decade. A few more restaurant selections could make it even better. Always good celebrity watching, even if you are not that into it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinLBC
50,Kings/Lakers/concerts --go!,"Staples is a huge complex--love when we go to the box--fantastic dessert cart will NOT disappoint you..it is like a circus on wheels! Food is okay, but the venue is great. You will see stars, celebrities and neighbors all in the same night! Concerts are great, easy to get in and out and of course tons of restaurants and fun places to go before and after the game or show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1825ZNjuliev
50,wow,great place to visit for the whole family. lots to do and see in the surrounding area. lots of things at nite going on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
50,LOB CITY,While the Lakers are though of as kings the Clippers might be able to steal the throne. Section 331 front row right on top of the home team tunnel. Never a problem. Great view of the court. Get to the game 30 minutes before hand and you can buy a meal deal at a price savings.Bottled water is allowed in the place unlike the Honda Center. Take the Metro Blue Line to the venue and get off right outside and skip the freeway and parking mess. Street vendors selling hot dogs and sausages with grilled onions on the sidewalk when you leave. Skid Row is right down the street if you need any party favors. Clippers Nation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexn228
50,Outstanding Facility!,"Second time at the Staples Centre, once for basketball and once for hockey! Love the atmosphere and how clean it always is.

50,the lakers and morrissey,"this place is perfectly organised. there is no sense of disorder or impending doom. everyone is there to help. it's very casual and I just found the environment very safe. food is ok, but I am difficult!

40,Kings Game,"We had center ice seats in row 8. Having been in other NHL arenas, this one seemed less suited to hockey. The seats were comfortable. The staff were very friendly. Saw a few celebrities. Good selection of food and beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/layne17
50,Great arena....,"Area is beautiful and very well maintained....they put you through a metal detector when you go through the door, food is great for a sport arena, staff is friendly and very helpful, and the arena is supported my plenty of parking if you dont mind paying for it...saw the Lakers in a VIP suite and it was outstanding!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drivebmr
50,worth it!!,"went to watch the clipper/bucks game and it was well worth the bucks & 4 hours. even went the ball was not in play, they had heaps of talent on show with music & entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aspib2018

50,Awesome Facility for Lakers' Game!,"Even having nose-bleed seats like mine, the facility was still fantastic! The view was good and it was easy getting in and out of the arena. I was worried that I would get stuck in the crowd of people, but it didn't happen. I stayed until the end of the game, but then wasted no time leaving and it was a breeze! I didn't even have to wait in line for the metro, I just got right on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylan98

40,Nice arena,"This arena is continually transforming from one event to the other. In a 36 hour span we witnessed the arena going from the Clippers court, to the Lakers court, to the ice surface for the Kings - amazing! They also change the apparel selections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPP566
50,A great sports venue!,"Saw a recent Lakers game at the Staples center. We were staying in the LALive area so it was super easy. No problems getting in, really good food. We had good seats to begin with but it didn't look like there were too many bad seats in the place. Ticket prices are steep everywhere but the Lakers are entertainment as well as NBA. A really fun night out that I hope to do again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcdedrick

50,Grammy Awards 2013,"Great venue!! Given the event, the security was through the roof so safety was the first priority. Lots of staff, plenty of restrooms. Sad they didn't service alcohol during the show (however most everyone just as I had gone to a pre party with lots of food and drinks, so it was not a huge deal). In our gowns inside the arena my only complaint was that it was SO cold!!!! Besides that, amazing time. Had the time of my life, great seats!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaMC86
50,Saw P!nk here,Went to see P!nk at the famed Staples Center - a very magnificent premise. Many F&B stalls located right inside so you can satisfy your palates. Just opposite is the Nokia Theatre where you can grab a bite or two before a show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XY_Boon
10,Bad neighbor hood.,use valet parking and do not leave the ground it is not safe too walk to a parking lot away from the center. the prices are through the roof. we can no longer afford to go. at the forum club I had season seats. priced me out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandlisaK
50,Party atmosphere,"Going to see a Basketball Game in a L.A. was a great experience. We booked tickets online and picked up at the stadium. We caught the subway from Hollywood/Highland to 7th Metro and walked the last bit, which was fun being with the crowds. There are also restaurants along the way that offer deals for fans. The centre has food and drinks to buy before the game, and of course merchandise which wasn't as expensive as we were expecting. Our seats were the 'cheap' ones right at the back, but this gave us a great view of the whole stadium. With the all the music, lights, kiss cam and Laker girls dancers, you don't even need to be interested in the game to enjoy it! We were lucky though as it was a close game between the Lakers and the Hornets, which the Lakers won. It's a real party atmosphere as most of the crowd support the local team, the Lakers. You might even see a celebrity or two courtside. Leaving the centre we walked back to the subway for the trip home. Vendors are set up along the way selling merchandise if you missed out at the centre. Overall an experience I would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45KathyB45
40,Grammy's,Great venue. Plenty of amenities and not too crowded during intervals. A little confusing when loo9king for the entrance but on the whole a good venue to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/168MichelleC
50,One word....WOW!!!!,"This was a huge highlight for me and my brothers and it exceeded our expectations. From the streets to the seats this is something everyone has got to do at least once in their lifetime! The crowds are enthusiastic and the arena is pumping from the time you walk in to the time you swim out with the crowd. Lights, cameras and non stop action and entertainment. Can't wait to go back and do it all again. Only thing I suggest is that you spend a little more for some decent seats or your experience could go two ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiannaH23
40,great,i have been at the staples center multiple times since 2008 its a great arena.everytime i was at a lakers or clippers game but the arena is actually really nice.nothing that blows you out of the water but the glitz and glam are kind of cool.either way its something that anyone should exprience once in there life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RovadS
50,Amazing,"Pretty much amazing. First time to visit the venue took pictures of all statues of great athletes in L.A just outside staples.It was on a game between New Orleans hornets vs the lakers. Lakers won the lopsided game. Saw my favorite athletes Chris Paul, kobe bryant, pau gasol. Paul was still with the orleans then.Great feeling to finally go inside the jam packed crowd chanting defense while seeing a lot of celebrities like Tom cruise and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Food_eric
30,Meh...,"As much as I heard the Staples Center was the premier venue for sports and entertainment, I wasn't all that impressed.The LA Live area outside was really cool, and they were shooting the crossover episode of Hawaii Five O & NCIS. I used a porta potty that was meant for the extras, I felt like a movie star.Outside the venue there's statues of Gretzky, Magic, Oscar, and some guy that looked like my dad. I'm sure he's important to LA sports history.For as impressive as the outside of the building looks, Inside the venue, it's nothing special compared to other areas around the country.For all hype I've heard of this place, it lacked a state of the art, high end feel, and already seemed a little dated. If you really want to see an impressive arena like that check out Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.They did have a fancy new score board, and I understand bells and whistles aren't everything, but this place also lacked personality. The Joe in Detroit might be falling apart but it still has a charm, whether it be for a concert or Wings game. That place has history.Probably didn't help I went to a Kings game, and most of the crowd was more interested in playing with their twitter accounts. There was not much to keep the crowd entertained during breaks, and there wasn't even much excitement after they scored. This is the team that went on to win the STANLEY CUP.Maybe a Lakers or Clippers game they would be more excited, but I'm a hockey fan, so Ill never know. Staples Center you stink! However you did have an interesting sports museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew0027
40,Pretty amazing,Wow I mean I've been outside many times but the inside is pretty sweet .... The outside atmosphere is awesome with restaurants and the people watching. The staple center is what you would expect of la big colorful with lots of Roomie seats,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raychael84
40,Preferred venue!,"We recently saw Muse here, and the venue is great! Anywhere your seat is, you have a good view! It's right at LA Live, so there's lots of lights and restaurants to go to. Staples is easy to get to from the freeway as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LO_SD
40,Gutted I didnt see the Lakers,"Gutted I never got to see the Lakers whilst in LA. Went to the Staples as part of a LA tour, very nice arena, in the heart of LA Live, Downtown LA. If the Lakers are around, go and see them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arron1403

50,Clippers vs Thunder,"Our first ever NBA match and we were overwhelmed with atmosphere! Drove up from Anaheim and parked directly across the road for $10 for the day. Parked car around 11.00 and then walked into 'town' for a look around. Parking was easy and we did Will Call ticket pick up which was also very easy. Had tickets in lower section (AUD175 each) on end/corner which were fantastic, clear view of players and all the action on the court. BAthroom facilities good and clean despite the large number of spectators. Food options as you would expect and prices you would expect - slightly inflated. Amazing experience if you have the chance go and see a game - to get the best view you will have to pay a higher price for your tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roko_me
50,Show Time!,"Incredible. I was there for a NBA game (Clippers vs Hornets) and was exactly as expected: organization and very good installations, lot of gift options and very secure. You can use Events arena parking lot, and after game, ESPNZone was in front of Staples Center exit! Nice!Entrance rate: depends on which zone will you be seating, but normally not so expensiveFood and Bevs: very expensiveParking: lot of space, from 10 to 30 dollars of rate.For now, I can just say: it worth for the fun and for the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raphgbicalho
50,A great place to watch sports if you have good seats,"I love love love Staples Center! It is no doubt one of the premium sport arenas , many events you can see if you got the $$. I've been here to see Britney Spears. I've seen performances where the stage was front and center. I also attend many sports events there. I lately came for the Lakers vs. Jazz game and it was amaze balls! Some events even Lakers tickets can get under value price ticket if you goes to site like Ticketsinventory.com . Overall, great venue for any game, concert, or whatever. I want to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298SarahS298

40,A great place to watch sports IF you have good seats,"We recently caught a Clippers game and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The arena is large, loud and the fans passionate for their team. We were surprised at how the arena is laid out; little use of overhanging balconies which means the upper deck (which is perched above three levels of luxury suites) seats are as far from the action as you'll find in any arena together with crowded hallways and only a mediocre offering of food. I've been to many other arenas that offering a much more intimate setting with the same occupancy (for example, the Air Canada Centre in Toronto). If you plan on catching a game or seeing a concert make sure you very carefully select your seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
50,Phenomenal place to see a concert!,"I went with a close friend to see John Legend and Sade. We had floor seats and I jhave to admit, for a large venue, I really appreciated the sound quality, acoustics, and light effects. We had an amazing time. Don't forget to buy a bag of Zebra Corn!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smcrawford38
50,A splendid indoor multi-purpose arena/venue.,"I went to the Staples Center to see a couple of hockey games. The arena is modern, has very good sight lines and is clean and attractive. It is spacious and I would imagine well suited for many different attractions.I'm sure that to some degree your enjoyment would be based on where you sit and the proximity to the stage or playing area. That though is a matter of affordability and ticket availability.There are multiple food court areas serving diverse menus. Everything is over-priced but that goes with the territory..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerM965
50,Steep arena!,"We watched a game of the LA Lakers here. It was great, the atmosphere, the game, the fans etc. We had seats on the toprow and from there it is very very steep to walk down!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dekpau
50,Awesome Venue,"We have been to many venue's for concerts and the Staples Center was awesome. Its new, clean, in downtown LA near a bunch of restaurants, hotels, etc. The paperless entry tickets we had for our MUSE concert worked well. A bit hesitant at first on how it worked and if we could get through the line ok, but it was a breeze and the staff was very helpful at getting us in the door, through security, our wrist bands on for the floor section and headed in the right direction to be able to sit in the 2nd row from the stage. A+ employees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovept

50,Check whats on while your near.....,"Went to Lakers v Knicks basketball game, the stadium was really good, easy, close parking for 25 dollars, there are different bars and types of fast food available so walk around inside.

It was big and spacious, and easy to leave from! there was a lot of people around for the Clippers vs Dallas Game on 1/9/13 but it was still easy to get around... game tickets were cheap too! And with the way the Clippers are playing, it will be a good game/show to watch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cvsteph09
50,WOW!,"A huge stadium but although full did not feel crowded in areas. It was impressive and we saw the clippers there was so much going on the lights, dancers, basketball a really fun evening out.

50,Wow!!,Three rows of Box Seats to start with!! The powerful energy of a Lakers game at Staples is totally amazing!! The high-energy Clippers crowd is fun too..

We got in with no trouble, the line to get in moved very quickly and we were able to find out seats with no problem because everything is marked very well. Many restrooms and helpful staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaC28
50,Clippers Home Game,"We were in for the Clippers V Lakers game.I love the Staples Center. It was easy peasy to get to, and get around.

40,Pretty BIG,"I went to a Lakers game for the first time this last time I was in LA for work.....and was Wowed, by the Staple Center.

50,Kings Season Ticket Holder 07-11,"Staples is an Operatic setting. Holding 18k when standing room only and being very large and spacious inside, it is a beautiful venue. Without new HD scoreboards as a great enhancement. I've enjoyed every type of event there though, concerts, Laker games, exhibits. I've sat down low, up high and everywhere in between. There is not a bad view at Staples. I've been to a lot of sports stadiums and I am sure there is bias in my opinion but Staples is certainly a top five.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erik4Travel
50,Staples Center is good for just about anything,"I've been to a lot of arena's, and Staples is one of the most classy places I've been. There are very-good food options when you're in the Arena, and something that really makes the area special overall is LA Live - tons of restaurants and just a fun/nice place to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewW895
50,Lakers Basketball Game,"Liked the statues, seeing all of the mature players on the walls on the floor. The lines were long, but it was well worth it. Good view and seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0z2012
50,Excellent arena,Always a good place to catch a game . . . . . or spend ages scanning the crowd looking out for the stars. I've attended loads of basketball games here and although the Lakers attract the stars it's Clippers games which provide the best atmosphere and fun amongst the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tw2310
50,An amazing venue for sport and the arts,"We visited the Staples Centre to attend a LA Lakers basketball game and were fortunate enough to have a tour of the facility before the game. An amazing venue. If you are attending an event, get there early so you can look around, absorb the atmosphere in the general area. Even though our seats were ""up in the Gods"" we still had a good view of the action and were impressed with the access and the way crowds moved in and out of the Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binduAustralia
30,Handling the crowds well,"The Staples Center is able to handle the traffic in a pretty smooth way.You feel the crowds, but you are able to navigate well among the people.There is also a fairly descent restaurant located on one of the floors, for those that are not interested in frequenting the concession stands.Those using the ""super boxes"" also have access to the gourmet carts that have a great selection of goodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardL624
30,A great event,"Saw the Lakers play the Utah Jazz.While the local fans were not happy it was a good night.We parked in a lot on Grand Avenue. $10 for the night and only a couple of blocks away. There were plenty of people around so it was quite safe.The venue is well organised and adjacent to LA Live - a great spot to spend a few hours with game machines, restaurants, bars etc. The area has quite a buzz.Any seats in the 100's section will give you a fairly close-up view of the game. Personally I don't like watching basketball from too high up and far away, Seats are comfortable although they are a little narrow.Major criticism is that are the queues at the food and drink concessions are too long, Of course the prices are high but there was no way I could get a drink at half time.Ditto there was a very lengthy queue at the men's restroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMRFamily
40,Good place for a game,"If you find a good game or concert to see, this location is a worthy place to see it. Its an easy on and off the highway location with well market roads. Great modern designed stadium with versatile events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speel
50,Lakers home game,"My sis and I saw the Lakers V Magic on Dec 2 and despite the loss, we had a great time at our first Lakers game. I'm a huge Lakers fan, so it was really great seeing Kobe play before he retires. Will definitely go to another game in my next visit :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaalmario
50,"Loved it, wish we could go more","We were in La for 4 nights & went to 3 NBA games, 2 Lakers & 1 Clippers.

50,Another bucket list check,"First time at the Staples Center. Watched the Clippers demolish the Kings. Our seats were high enough that I could see the game and watch the Mars Rover at the same time but you get what you pay for. (section 304. View was actually quite good) Fantastic to see all the Lakers jerseys on the wall, to do a little shopping at the stadium store and we lucked out and caught the attention of the staff looking for energetic fans and scored a clippers shirt during the game. Overall it was a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrotherBoggs
50,Came here for Lakers v Orlando Magic,"Neither my mum or I were basketball fans, but I felt we just had to soak in the NBA game atmosphere while we were here since the sport is huge here. I must say, though I am more of a football/soccer person, this was one an eye-opening experience for me.I got the tickets for the game almost two months earlier through ticketmaster.com and though it was quite expensive because of all the add-on charges ($93 for two originally $35 tix - cheapest in the stadium) I think everyone should pay to experience this at least once. It didn't really matter that we were in the back row of the gigantic indoor stadium since we weren't really there for seeing the players up close but just to soak in the atmosphere really. There were these huge screens which zoom in on the players and fans as well - so we got to see David Beckham! And ya, a Lakers game is probably good for spotting celebrities as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chunlian

50,Great atmosphere,"Took 2 teenagers to see the Clippers v Timberwolves. Great seats, helpful staff, amazing atmosphere and saw some of the best players in the world up close (K.Love & C.Paul).

40,Lakers Game,"Unnormally cold in LA in November but well worth the trip. As you go to the stadium, you get to check out the Espn Zone, and the Nokia Center. JWMarriott is right next door and they are several restaurants around it. If you get there early and hang around the Ritz (beside JW) you might get to see Kobe (he stays there hours before the game). Inside the Center, you have the history (banners and statues) plus the ambiance is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rniles

Staples Center is totally family-oriented, with something for everyone. It isn't exactly cheap, but neither is it prohibitively expensive (unless you want a ticket to a Laker game!!). Go ahead. take the whole family, and enjoy walking around the surrounding area now known as ""L A Live."" It used to be more like "" LA Confidential.""

We were in the nosebleed seats but still had a great view and were able to appreciate the action and the atmosphere.

The Tripadvisor forums were also very helpful in working out transport to the centre from Anaheim but we caught a taxi home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyTraveller5ofus
20,Sucks for Concerts! Go go for the Nokia Center across the street.,"The worst venue ever to see a concert. The acoustics are terrible. They leave it to each band to figure out on their own, leading to high variability. The best it has been is fair. Most of the time, can't hear the vocalists very well and the music meshes together due to too much echo. Staples needs to get their act together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msagman

50,Best venue,"I'm a Los Angeles native (well sorta) and visit here very often. It's extremely clean and modern. Like every other venue I've ever been too the food is way overpriced but that's expected. I've sat in all sorts of seats and there really isn't a bad one except for basketball games you don't want to end up in the end zone. Even if you're way far away they have an amazing new jumbotron so everything is crystal clear.I'm here almost weekly for Clippers games, I saw Kanye//Jay-z here, I also saw Lady Gaga here and I've never had a bad experience.The in arena staff are really helpful when you're trying to locate your seats and always super friendly.Definitely a LA must-visit.Tip: If parking isn't included in whatever ticket you bought you're better off parking in a non-staples center lot. They're way overpriced and there are parking lots just as close (just about anywhere along Flower and Hope) that are much cheaper.Also, if you're going to buy beer at Staples avoid the bar, they charge about $2 more than the places that sell food for the same brand (Blue Moon, Heineken, Stella etc)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChelsiaB

We paid $40 a seat for section 319 row 12. We could still tell which players were Blake Griffin or Chris Paul but probably would have had a better experience in the $75 or $120 seats. So save up or get a raise If you want to take your whole family. Also, make life easier and take CASH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bball-Mom03
40,Superb stadium,"This is a facility that clearly takes pride in their teams and appearance. I attended a Clippers game and was greater by several tents and events happening right outside the Staples Center which gave me a reason to kill time before the game. Once in the stadium it's easy to navigate and help is convieniently placed around in case an issue arises. A beer will run you about $11 and tshirt about $40, but it is completely worth it in the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMCmass

30,"Basket Ball, Hockey, Concerts at a Premium","I have been to Staples to see some of my favorite Teams, The Kings, The Lakers, The Globetrotters, etc. Cost for game is high this is a $$$$ place to go. The plus side is great sports, You can dine in or at The Pantry down the street, You can eat at at LA Live some great places to eat, But you will spend your dollars, A family of four needs to save up for this event. Staples does offer some discounts to groups like the scouts, and other community organziations to check with your local group you may just be able to aford the visit. If you have problems with looking down from high places beware of the 300 level seats. Great view but you are at a great height. The only bad seat I have ever had was behind the basket on the level one hunderd seats, The seat was centered right on the pole so I missed part of the game. So check the website for view from your seat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552StevenA

50,PAC-12 Basketball Tournament,Great place with the exception of prices charged for food. Heard the attendance was much lower than expected and with their food prices I can see why. Also parked in the Staples Center parking lot which for the first two days was $15.00 per day then when we went on the third day the parking increased to $25.00 which is outrageous considering the arena was not full. The final day we found a lot that charged $15.00 and was just as close but didn't have covered parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgibsonaz
30,"Nazi ushers, plastic seats & overpriced food","As a sports venue, Staples Center feels like it was done cheaply. You will overpay for everything - parking, food and tickets and will be treated with suspicion. You are not allowed to bring outside food in, must have bags searched and go through metal detectors and be ""wanded"". Even though the venue was almost empty, ushers watch to see that you sit where your seats say - unless until 15 minutes into the event. T least there seem to be enough bathrooms, but, like I stated, the venue was at most a third full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrnrMom

We were able to grab dinner at a resturant in LA Live which has a lot of choices. Quick walk over the front of Staples, after getting through the security it was pretty easy walking around and finding our seats in section 210. The arena didnt fill up until the game had already started. The Clippers put on a good pre-game show and overall it was worth the ticket prices.

30,Big city indoor stadium,"Overpriced everything - parking, drinks, food, souvenirs. Allow at least a half hour more than you think you'll need to park, make it through the metal detectors and find your seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phineas55
50,La kings,"Fantastic way to start a trip in the USA,fantastic venue great value for money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WAussie1
40,Getting to Staples Centre,"Had tickets to the LA Lakers game at Staples Centre and was worried about how to get to the game. The concierge at the hotel said to catch a bus to the game and then a taxi home ($80 approx ) I am glad I listened to my wife and the Hertz Car hire at the hotel and decided to hire a car. The drive was easy ( we did leave before peak hour ) and found plenty of parking near the centre ($15 flat rate). Also had the car for a day to go to Hollywood Blvd, Rodeo Dr etc. In the end it actually saved us money ( approx $100 to hire the car ). After the game didn't see too many taxis or bus stops, we were in the car and back at the hotel in about 30 mins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wglee
40,Great Seats all around,"No matter where you sit, the seats are pretty good. We were very high up, but still had an excellent view. Our camera batteries ran out and we could not purchase new batteries anywhere in the center. Also, the choice of snacks was limited and repetitive. I would enjoy visiting again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraw46
40,GO HOCKEY!,"When I told my son that I wanted to take him on vacation, his only question was if we could attend a hockey game while we were in Los Angeles.Apparently yes, yes we could. We went to the LA Kings versus Colorado Avalanche (he is an Avs fan). Our seats could not have been any better (8 rows back from the ice). The food prices were reasonable (far better than those at Pepsi Center!) and the location was very clean.We will definitely return. Just hope next time MY Kings will win... :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SleepingFoxandSon
50,Great Place to see an event,Lakers and that other basketball team and Kings Ice Hocky are great to see there. We saw the Eagles play was really good. Lots of restrooms and snack bars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredIBEW
50,"What can you say, the best sports venue in North America!","Have been there many times for concerts, basketball games and other special events. But got some hockey tickets and couldn't wait. This venue has got it all, great service and excellent staff. It takes a lot of money and hard work to keep a venue at the top of it's game.Would highly recommend for any occassion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverTraveler-11
50,Go Kings Go - LA Kings in the NHL is unreal,"We only went to the hockey because the NBL was in lockout but wow what a blast. We had so much fun, the game is so fast and in between there is plenty of entertainment. Our kids had heaps of fun. We sat near the top (but ""Center Ice"", ie on halfway), and we had a great view. They also have an awesome scoreboard with video so you miss nothing. There was only one goal scored when we were there, by the Kings over the Dallas Stars with 4 mins to go and the place exploded with delight.As a parent with young kids, I was also impressed with how safe it was. We felt safe walking around and the Metro (subway) was also safe as well as clean (not graffiti, how do they do that).If you want a great night out, go see the LA Kings. The only tip I have is an obvious one - take some warm clothes in case the icy atmosphere does not agree with you - I only put on a fleece in the last (3rd) period but the family had theirs on the whole time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dogboy63
50,Go the Clippers,In Hollywood for a few days and wanted to see a basketball game. Easy trip on the Metro and then a 15 min walk. Good venue and our nosebleed seats were still very good. Plenty of food outlets and other facilities were good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozziemale1964
40,Great Sports Venue!!,"I've gone to staples center for many sporting events. Laker, KIngs, Clipplers, Avengers and Sparks! I have sat in different upper lever seats and, let me tell you that there is NO bad seat in the house!!If you're in LA and want to have fun and catch a good sporting event, visit this place.....pluse LA Live is right across the street where there's lots more to do...food and music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fer_LA_11
50,Great fun!,Went for a Lakers Playoff game and was awesome. Ppl outside giving away freebies. And sitting there watching Lakers play...wow! I honestly know absolutely nothing about basketball but I had a blast! I just wanted to see Jack(nicholson)...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
40,Good Arena,"Went to a Sparks game and the seating was comfortable. Great food choices inside the arena, and after the event you step out the front doors and can enjoy LA Live which is a happenin' spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chundell
50,Great Stadium,"Staples Center is a great stadium. I've never been to a hockey game there but the Lakers games and concerts are great. The place is well designed whether its a great seat or cheap seat, you'll have a good view of the action. Lakers games are always packed but I recommend checking them out. World class talent whether they are on top or not. Drinks aren't cheap but they never are in a stadium. Cheers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveWilkinson_11
10,Foreign tourists beware!!!,"Foreign tourists beware!!!If you are not a US citizen & you would like to drink at the Staples Centre they will refuse you alcohol if you don’t have your Passport with you on the day.We are Australian tourists in the US going to see a concert & were refused alcohol at this venue as our proof of age drivers licences weren’t considered a safe source of identification, which is complete crap.Completely spoiled our night, & was the only case like this since our 5 weeks in USA & we did not get this anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussietour123
50,cool place,"I went with my husband who is a big hockeyfan to the Staples Center to watch the Kings. It's easy to find, easy to park the car in the area. The stadium is very nice, big, modern, lovely. I have seen lots of stadiums (even though we are from Switzerland) in the US and Canada but the Staples center is the most beautiful we have seen so far. We would definitely come again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matamanoa81
40,"Staples is a blast, not a bad seat in the house","Great place to catch some NHL and NBA actionI attend almost all Kings games and Staples Center is always a thrill to be in. The atmosphere is great, not a bad seat in the house (at least for hockey)If your scared of heights then splurge for the lower bowl seating because the 300's are high and steep. But they are still quality seats.The new scoreboard is brand new for 2010 and is incredible. All HD and unbelievably huge.Concessions are average but pricey. There are some good things on the menu, so make sure you walk around the concourse a bit. Don't just settle for McDonald's or CPK. Some nice deli sandwiches places are located throughout the concourse.There is a smoking patio on the 300 level, but that is the only place you can smoke. No in and outs.Parking can get expensive. $25 if you want to park right across the street at LA Live. But the best kept secret is the lot regulars park in.Its $7 buks and within a 5-10 minute walk to the arena. It is locatedhttp://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=831%20S.%20Francisco,%20Los%20Angeles,%20CA&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wlRight off the 110 freeway so really quick and easy to get out on the freeway after a game. You end up walking past the street traffic on fig, jumping in your car and cutting all that street traffic as you enter the 110.If your in the area, and its now a very nice area to check out, take in staples center and watch some hockey. (best sport to see live)GO KINGS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixSix
30,I love the staples center,"I have been to the staples center many times. This venue is my Favorite here in Los Angeles, because it is more bigger and mostly the most popular artis perform there. The staples center is big it is divided by 3 sections upper level medium n lower level what I like about the staples center is that your seats are guaranteed therefore you can arrrive anytime n ur sear is reserved . Watch oh for the best seats in the venue which are sections 100's and general admssion lower level",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddylpz4592
40,Offers more than just the game,"Staples Center is a glitzy looking stadium that hosts many Los Angeles sports franchises and hosts events and concerts for some of the most famous acts in the world. The stadium is in impeccable shape and is truly the best arena I have ever been to. They have a wide variety of food and many vendors so the lines aren't too long. The only issue I had with the arena was that parking was very expensive and that due to the high demand to watch the teams and concerts, ticket prices are naturally going to be high. Be careful parking on the street as there are many seedy areas around the stadium. After the game however, there is extra entertainment to be had outside of the stadium at LA Live. I would definitely recommend making a trip out to this arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HexterGastoscar
