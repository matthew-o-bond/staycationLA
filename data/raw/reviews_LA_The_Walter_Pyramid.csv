20,"Looks cool from a distance, not up close","If you're already visiting the CSU Long Beach campus it's worth checking out, otherwise there's not much to see. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it. It looks cool from a distance when you see it on campus, but up close it's less attractive.",ESL Teacher

50,Great place to see Lakers summer league,"The Walter pyramid is part of the CSULB campus and where I go to see the Lakers summer league for next to nothing.

Something to please everyone. On a side note, another unique attraction there is the Japanese Gardens, which are amazing!!. Go early and make a day of both attractions.",Don B
30,"From the outside, this is a striking piece of architecture on campus","I was only able to see the pyramid driving by on 2 days. This is a nice piece of architecture on a campus that was built with bland, boring 60s - 80s spartan type design. Depending on the day and the lighting, the blue takes on a different shade.",chicago90Phoenix
30,Here for a Jiu Jitsu tourney,"Spent two full days here. Place was pretty packed and lots going on. The venue itself was large and easily accommodated the 2800 competitors and families and friends.The food was is pretty bad, and just one concession open. The restrooms are awful, getting more disgusting as the day went on. They definitely need to improve their services on this front especially as so many athletes change into their uniforms in the bathrooms.$12 per person per day entry fee (parents of children also have to pay). Ridiculously long 30 minute wait to buy entry tickets.",Timothy H

50,A Beautiful and Unique Piece of Architecture,"There are very few modern pyramids in the world and there are only three in that I know of in the USA -- The Walter Pyramid at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) is one of them. It is a truly one-of-kind structure in this part of the state and rises majestically from the manicured lawn that serves as its street-side ""welcome mat"" -- giving an otherwise normal-well maintained suburban neighborhood quite a view! I have attended sporting events, exhibitions and fairs here. It has also hosted concerts and it has served as a filming location as well. There are no bad seats for viewing an event here and it has definitely become one of the most identifiable land-marks in southern California.",Observer333
30,What a cool building!,The pyramid can be seen from miles around. It's imposing glass structure is an impressive sight. It's also the entrance to the university. If you have some spare time.. give it a gander.,Chad H
