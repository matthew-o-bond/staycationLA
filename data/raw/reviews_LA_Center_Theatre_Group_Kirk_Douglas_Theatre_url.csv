50,The Best Local Theater,"The Kirk Douglas Theater is located in the heart of little downtown Culver City. It used to be a movie house and was built sometime in the late 40s or early 50s. It has been redone to the way it was and it is beautiful.The theater is small and intimate. It is the perfect place to see a play. It is run by the Center Theater Group, which also runs the bigger houses in downtown Los Angeles. The Douglas tends to have newer plays, sometimes viewing there for the first time.Parking is either on the street or in the back. You will find a space. The pricing is wonderful for such great plays they put on. You will love it, if you like original theater. Have a great time in Culver City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

40,Intimate setting ideal for broad range of productions.,"Our introduction to the place was an hilarious Spamilton all rap satire targeting Lin-Manuel Miranda and his Hamilton musical, and virtually all of commercial Broadway. The small theatre was ideal, enabling easy following of the fast rap that would have been swallowed in a larger setting. With easy on-street or garage parking, and a range of restaurants immediately around it, the Douglas is a very pleasant night out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billa651

50,Small and Wonderful,"The Kirk Douglas Theater used to be a movie house and was very popular during the 50's and through the 70's when mega plexi screen came along and put the theater out of business.The outside is the same and super cool with 50's features, even the tile on the outside of the building.The play house is small and there is not a bad seat.The pricing is very reasonable and I assume subsidized.They have different types of plays from musicals to one acts and everything in between. Some of the new work, is just that new, and some in need of work. Other plays are great and ready to be seen by all.It all really depends on the type of theater you like. This is a small house, it is not the Pantages in Hollywood so don't expect fancy stages etc. But now and again you will see a gem by a new playwright and you will love it.Parking is great, you can often find a spot on the street (mind the signs) and there is parking in the back as well.It is worth a try and it is nice to support new work. You can get discounts through Goldstar or by a season pass.Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

40,First Time Attendee,"We had the pleasure of attending a play at the Kirk Douglas Theater in Culver City. Plenty of parking was available for the Sunday matinee. We parked underground for free at Culver City City Hall which is behind the theater. The parking entrance is on Duquesne Avenue. Although we didn't eat in Culver City, we noticed there were plenty of restaurant surrounding the theater.We climbed a couple flights of stairs to get to the upper level of seating at the back of the theater. Sight lines to the stage were fine, and while we brought binoculars to view the play, we really didn't need them. It's a wonderful little theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796ja

40,"Small Venue, not a bad Seat in the House","We got last minute tickets here and had to sit on the side lines.

50,One of best mid sized theatres in L.A. area.,The Kirk Douglas is a theatre that is affiliated with the Center Theatre Group.It was originally a movie theatre in Culver City called the Culver which is now a historical building. Kirk Douglas and his wife contributed the money to change the movie house into a legitimate mid size theatre. It is a wonderful theatre with great acoustics and sightlines. The plays tend to be a little more experimental than the larger theatresA bonus there is free covered parking in the city hall parking lot a block away. Also many trendy restaurants within walking distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
50,Los Angeles Favorite- Unconventional and Exciting,"The Kirk Douglas is one of my favorite Los Angeles Theatres. It's intimate ( no seat is bad), modern and I can always expect to see an experimental evening of theatre. The offerings never disappoint.On my most recent trip, I took my in-laws to see ""The Object Lesson"". I can honestly say that none of us have ever had an experience quite like it. Jaws were dropped!Parking is easy and free at City Hall, located just behind the theatre. There are also plenty of restaurants on the same block, making it a great destination for a complete night out.I've been to the Douglas about ten times and each experience has been exciting and special. This is not the playhouse for conventional theatre, but sometimes you need to step outside of your comfort zone and be rattled!Like my review? Check out my blog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
40,Small playhouse with excellent theater,"This is a small playhouse, seats around 300 people, located in downtown Culver City. The plays are first rate, usually very small cast (or one-man-show), but great to see close-up in this intimate theater. Parking is close by and free. There's also a wealth of eateries within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkj1111
40,Landmark,"The Theater: What a historic landmark in Culver City. The theater is very well maintained. They still keep the original box office in front of the theater. Very cool~ Inside the theater, there is concession stand, selling drinks (including soda, beer, cocktail & wine) and snacks. There are seating area next to the concession stand. They allow drinks inside the theater but no food.The theater and stage are not too big. Every seat is good seat. Good sound effect too!The Service: All the staffs are very friendly and helping. Very pleasant experience.The Parking: City Hall Parking Structure (FREE during weekends)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Perfectly designed and sized for cozy intelligent theater,"Smart theater, staged well in a historic, restored venue, with a really nice house staff (and above average selection of food and drinks at the lobby bar).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
30,"Good Show, Average Theatre","Recently visited this theatre in Culver City to see the 'Girlfriends' play. Play itself was not bad overall; it started off a bit slow but steadily picked up. Writer was able to infuse a good mix of comedy, drama and social awareness in a space of 90 minutes. The actors were very good; you have to give it to these two guys who were able to hold the stage on their own for a straight 90 mins without a break. Acting was so good that sometimes I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching a movie screen. However, the theatre was a tad cold, and the ambiance was not that great. Most of the shows I've seen have been in the West End (London) or Broadway, and those theatres leave this in the dust; but hey maybe I'm not comparing Apples with Apples. Overall, good show, average theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hungryblackman
40,Chavez Ravine revisited in a Play,"What a great script for a play: movies of actual homes, landscape and people added to live musicians and actors (4) reliving the history of building Dodge Stadium in Los Angeles.It was clever, great music, wonderful acting and the interplay of all the medias made it work beautifully. Found out about how things really get done in Los Angeles. Afterwards they have a lobby QandA with staff and actors adds a nice closure to the fabulous play.Good size theatere near lots of restaurants and parking nearby. The history of that area in Los Angeles in the 1940s, 50s and now what it is is a great story and many schools bring children to learn about it as well. Lots of fun, history and great performance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73helenew
