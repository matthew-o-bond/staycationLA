20,Clean toilets... that’s about it,"Just came out of a nice Thai place about a block away. and being far away from my hotel, my buddy and I were searching for an open toilet to release the kraken.Well we saw free exhibit and went in. We had to go through the exhibit to get to the toilet.This is a massive collection of outliers treated as status quo, paranoia, half truths, and full on lies. This is by far the highest psychological toll I’ve ever paid for a poo.Clean toilets tho...(Rated 2 because of toilets, the exhibit... let’s say that what I left behind was both more appealing and scientifically sound... please don’t go)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nj90210
10,"Beware, Scientology re-education center!!!","This is a center by the Cult of Scientology as an attempt to spread doubt about our scientific medical approaches. While psychiatry likely has room for improvement, this is designed as a dangerous entry point into this cult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GourmetRic
10,Not what I expected,"I expected an educational experience for my psychology class. What I got was brainwashed none-sense from the Church of Scientology. This was a complete waste of my time. The Church of Scientology does not believe in psychiatric conditions, so this whole museum is about how psychology is not a branch of science. DO NOT GO HERE. If you do, DO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY. I wish I would not have been fooled into thinking this would be an educational thing. The whole museum is loaded with the propaganda of the Church of Scientology's ideology about what psychiatric disorders are to them. NOT THE TRUTH about psychiatry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tykane01
10,What were thinking - Run away!!,We were walking down sunset blvd and were invited in for free. What a mistake - sick and disturbing distortion of history in what I can only describe as some sort of attempt at cult indoctrination. Actually quite scary when you're pushed into a padded cell to watch the first video. Would not recommend to any unless you plan on becoming a scientologist...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveofthefinn
50,Must see it will open your eyes to a world not many people know about.,This museum is free and incredible. The movies are short and to the point. This has been happening throughout history. Eye opening example of the atrocities of all citizens. Please see and write a review. Some viewings are not appropriate for children under 10-12 in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferl262
10,Really dude?,If you believe any of this I have some lovely real estate to sell you. fnhsdfh fdhsuf fnusdh fhsdio hfiosd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spideylover
40,Not for the faint-hearted,We're glad we didn't bring the kids. Very interesting way to kill a few hours but very macabre and can be disturbing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5484ZEmarie
