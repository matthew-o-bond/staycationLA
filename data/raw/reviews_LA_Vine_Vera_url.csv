30,Usual,Before coming there I read some Vine Vera reviews and I had some expactation. I can't say that I was diappointed. No. I was just ok. The cosmetics they provide is not something unusual however it may compete with other brands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natie_sunny
20,Do not waste your money,"The day time and night time moisturizer can be compared to any other generic brand. The reservatrol merlot fefining peeling cream (although in a pretty box) could do the same amount of removing dead skin cells, that a cloth could do. I keep all of my skin products to the temperature that they are recommended.. I pulled out the refining peeling cream today after no longer than a month and a half.. it has turned into jelly. I tried to work it in with fingers.. but it still will not turn into a product to apply. I work on a servers wage.. so to me.. this was a huge waste of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieBlais15
10,Deceived,"I was shopping one recent Saturday in Chandler Fashion Mall and I happened upon a Vine Vera store. There were two young men standing at the storefront handing out samples and doing quick demonstrations. I allowed one of them to demonstrate a product on my arm, I saw results so I agreed to go inside and learn more. The man had me watch a Dr. Oz video on his phone, was demonstrating different products on me all the while trying to convince me to purchase. When I told him I couldn't see spending that much he tried the ""buy this and I will throw this in"" trick. Finally I agreed to a one product on layaway. I put money down and was to return the following Saturday to pick it up. I arrived, the store doors were open, product was unprotected on the shelves (I checked to make sure they weren't empty boxes) but no one was around. Who leaves a high dollar product unattended in an open store in a mall? Anyway, I waited nearly 20 minutes thinking someone was in the private room doing a facial as that is what a sign said on a door on the back wall of the store and a lady from a nearby store came by to tell me the store is closed and is never open on Saturdays.I tried to tell her I was just there this past Saturday and made arrangements for this day. She said she didn't work there or know anything about it. I then said if a store is closed, who opened the doors? She then got deer in headlight look on her face and said she was sorry and she didn't know, she was just asked to come tell us to leave and lock the door. Now, how did anyone know we were there to contact her to tell us to leave? Were they hiding in the back? Were they watching on camera? I don't know. Either way, they got my money I never got my product. I tried looking for phone numbers and corporate contacts to make a complaint and get things rectified and turned up nothing. I did find numerous complaints about the product and the apparent scam they are operating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandatP9629ST
10,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,"I only had a sample of Daily Moisturiser, Merlot Collection. I tried on Saturday, it’s now Tuesday and my skin is still reacting to product, dry and sore. I have a normal skin complexion so not sure what nasties are hidden in the ingredients!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globetrekking2013
10,Vine Vera DON’T BUT big SCAM,"We recently visited Las Vagas April 2019, and everywhere there are stores set up to buy this anti age defying face and eye cream. They start but getting you to try this eye serum which dries in 30 sec, and it’s basically does the same thing as the product My Beautiful Eye cream, then they try and get you to buy this product by doing all the things that have already be discussed on other reviews However I did not buy, just as well cause after they demonstrated the eye cream on my self the next day I had a reaction to the product which made my under eye swell and it stayed like this for the rest of our time in Vagas 1 week and this was on the second day. My under eye went red and swollen and tingled and was very sore. I did go back to the shine Vera stand , but they would take no blame for this happening to me, they blamed everything possible like the sun burning my eyes while out walking, to that I had been rubbing them.After having a very heated argument with them I had to walk away cause I’m sure that if I stayed there any longer I would have hit the bloke over the head with any object that was close to my hands, I’m not usually a violent person.So please everyone out there be careful when letting them try their product on your face or eyes, I’m not saying that their product will affect everyone but just be careful !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kat2429
10,Vine Vera hoax,"In the store, I believe they used a souped up version or special mirrors to show the effect. However, doesn't do a darn thing, in my opinion while at home. Went thru 1-1/2 tubes of it, I look the same. They give you a lot of other products with your purchase. Haven't used them and suspect they are fine, but no miracles! LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYFLGAL
10,Caution !!!,"I’m writing this review to hopefully warn others of the terrible sales tactics of the people who work for this company that lure you in to buy the product.Firstly I have to say that I am generally very cautious and think before I buy but these guys firstly lure you in with a sample of moisturiser then say let me try some eye serum on you , then they put a face scrub on your hand then next out comes the manicure set where they buff your nail , I did keep saying to the sales girl that I would go away and think about it but seems to me that once your in they don’t let you go without a sale the price started off $600 for the eye serum plus they would throw in the scrub and manicure set , I nearly got out the door but the another sales person stepped in and kept me talking for another 10 mins and dropped the price to $250 and guess what I fell for it !!! Only after I walked away did I do the research and read the reviews all of which happened to me , I was extremely lucky and received a refund after I returned the products and insisted on a refund , so please just be sure it’s what you want and research the products",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helen-n-Pete

10,Vine Vera Silema Malta,I was vacationing in Malta and was invited in to Vine Vera to sample some product. I felt the Shiraz non surgical made a difference and I was reassured that the product I was purchasing was not available on line only in store so I purchased. The product was 20g that was being demonstrated. They quickly get you to pay and when you open your beautiful package it is only a 11g. When I got back to my hotel and googled it I was sickened to find the same product for $109 CAD. When I called them back Natasha told us we were wasting her time and hung up. I guess you are only good when you are reaching for your wallet. I give Vine Vera 2 thumbs down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving54777148483
40,Spa in United Square in Hongkong,"We bumped into this sales lady who is very convincing and persistent in trying the product. We did and honestly it looks like it’s working for the time being. I have big eye bag. Then she started selling the products and if we spend HK$3500, I will get some extra gifts plus she gave us 2 free facial in United Square. Not too bad, I thought.....Then we off to United square and we promised ourselves not going to spend a dime anymore for some cream or machine. Just do the facial and go...well, after the treatment, we were taken to special room and there was a lady who offered us the face ironing machine, for a absolutely crazy price. Course...we told her that we are coming back for another facial and we will get it then.Just be careful when you bumped into this cosmetic sellers, indeed they are very convincing and persistent, and we need to know how to say no. And you all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yudanih

30,CAUTION,"****PLEASE READ!! This will be the first of 2 reviews from me. I gave 3 stars because at the moment, I am doing some research and in order for me to even leave a review, I had to rate with stars. Here it goes....*****PLEASE READ******Here was my experience: A few days ago I was swayed to go into their store and ""just take a look"" at their products. Let me start by saying the staff was very passionate and informative about the Vine Vera products. In fact, so persuasive that I authorized a purchase of $995 for this magical eye lotion marketed as non-surgical with surgical results. To convince me to purchase, they added in ""for free"" 3 other items (3 free future facials, moisture day cream and moisture night cream). Ok. Here is the rub. Just now, I was researching and found what appears to be identical products on-line for what would have been a total of under $150 (minus the facials). After my sick to my stomach feeling I contacted the store owner there in Playa. He immediately responded and said those products are fake. (Fake News you know). So, I decided to order them and once I receive, I will do a comparison test. To include analysis of the ingredients. For now, they have 3 stars....However, should I find it is in fact identical....not only will they get 1 star from me, I will make it my mission to get the word out and they will be getting many more 1 stars from past customers.! If it is in fact ""fake"" on line, I will then, of course, let that be known. I can not stand either governments or private industries screwing over consumers....in fact, it is a mission of mine to call out what in fact is FAKE. Cheers everyone. And thanks for reading.. TO BE CONTINUED!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiewZ9293KA

50,Best Skin Care,"I came across a skin care brand called Vine Vera that I have come to love over the past few months.The thing that attracted me the most to Vine Vera was its beautiful decor, fantastic service and highly effective products. The prices were a bit too high for my liking, but after seeing how cool the products were, I had no qualms about purchasing them.My favorite product from the Vine Vera line is the eye cream. This eye cream is so cool. It does not give a greasy look and works wonders with your puffy eyes and dark circles.After using the product for a week, my puffiness went away and the dark circles have dramatically reduced over the past couple of months. Better yet, the eye area really looks nice.Well, eyes are the windows to your soul right? Mine finally look nice enough to qualify for the title ""windows"".I also tried out the deep peel at the Vine Vera store and it left me confused if I liked the eye cream more or the deep peel! Both products were fascinating in their own right.The eye cream gave you beautiful eyes, while the deep peel gave you flawless skin and kept acne in check. This peel basically works as the ultimate cleanser cum exfoliator which is so gentle on your skin that it actually leaves it looking moisturized, despite removing a lot of dead skin.I use this product twice every week and my acne issues have dramatically reduced in the last 2 months.I am sure that a few other products would have also impressed me, but sadly, I had already crossed my budgets (their staff reminded me this fact! I was astonished! Never seen a saleslady say no to a sale! Really thankfull coz things would have become difficult otherwise!)I shall certainly come back to the store in a few months for more purchases. Since these products last for close to a year, they should offer value for money as well.So impressed with Vine Vera and its staff. Will recommend the store to everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520jannett

50,Completely Bowled Over by Vine Vera,"If you’re looking to get away from the hustle bustle of the mall and are wanting to rejuvenate your body, look no further than Vine Vera. I recently went to the Vine Vera Store in Arcadia and it was almost as if I had stepped into an oasis of luxury. The store boasts of a beautiful décor, the staff make you feel like royalty and they also have stuff like free demonstrations, refreshments, free facials, etc. The routine is like a person greets you and asks which beverage you want, then pays attention to all your whims and fancies and gives you a tour of the store. They will also give you a questionnaire to fill up if you are a first time visitor so as to be able to offer the right kind of products that are customized to your skin. I think that its really cool because they actually have the right kind of stuff to do this.I have been to many salons and beauty stores that look OK, but Vine Vera isn’t OK. It is AWESOME. The décor, the look, the feel, the smells – everything is just perfect. And I could go on and on about the products. I admit they are a bit creepy in the sense that they make you end up purchasing a bit too much for your budgets, but you really cannot help it. The products are that good. And hey, I saw the demo. They used so little product. So they should last a while as well.Talking about the demonstration itself, they used a deep peel on my skin and followed it up with a moisturizer. I could go on and on about both products. The deep peel removed so much dead skin that its not funny. It was freakishly cool. The moisturizer was the perfect compliment. Together, they gave an instant shine to my skin and gave my face a unique natural glow.Im gonna come back again!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianen737
50,In love with vine vera,"A friend of mine had recently gone to the Vine Vera store and was very happy with their products. After seeing what these products did to her skin in just 2 weeks, I must say that I was inspired to visit the Vine Vera store myself. My experience at the store was a mixed bag. Yes, they had those aggressive sales practices that I read about, but the salesman was put aside by a senior store in charge the moment she realized that I wasn’t at all comfortable with the way this guy was trying to sell products to me. To compensate for my experience, she offered me a free skin consultation from their in-house skin specialist. The specialist was actually really good and she managed to tell me things about my skin that I didn’t know myself. She helped me chalk out a proper skin care routine and also offered me tips on how to change my diets and exercise routines to better suit my skin.I was really impressed and bought the products that she had suggested. I even altered my diets according to her suggestions. It’s been a month since I last went to the Vine Vera store and I don’t plan to use any other brand now. The results have been fantabulous. Not only does my skin look younger, I have finally managed to get over the acne issues that were haunting me since puberty. In fact, I tried a lot of products before Vine Vera, but I was never successful in getting rid of acne until now.What I like the best about Vine Vera is that their products are not just about solving your skin issues. Each of their products also helps out with anti-aging and keeps those fine lines and wrinkles at bay. I definitely recommend their products to all you ladies out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Devonmarie2
50,"Great skin, courtesy of Vine Vera!",I have been searching for skincare that will work for my skin for a long time but so far haven't found the right fit. I have been to many different ethesticians and facialists who have recommended different products. I have been feeling for a long time now that my skin is starting to really show the signs of aging - it is looking dull and dry and my wrinkles are more obvious. None of these options that I have tried have helped. It is frustrating to even think about how many different options I have tried. This was all until I came to Vine Vera. Since going to Vine Vera a couple months ago and getting my facial my skin looks so much better. I thought I would have to chock my bad skin up to aging and just accept it. Now I know I just didn't have the right tools to care for it. During my facial at Vine Vera I learned about how to better care for my skin. Thank you Vine Vera for all your help in making my skin better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orlytzuk
50,"Thank you Vine Vera, you make me feel like a new person.","I have been seeing some wrinkles and lines in the mirror and unlike some of my friends I am not excited to try Botox or other cosmetic procedures (esp those that involve needles!). I had tried different stuff including home remedies (messy, pain in the behind, didn't work). Checked out Vine Vera for the first time about 6 months ago and its been awesome!I am so glad I went because I feel like my skin looks much better now. The wrinkles are a lot less visible and seem more shallow. They seem like they are slowly getting smaller and smaller. What I like:-They want to know about you, they profile you. On your first time they have you fill out a questionnaire about your skin and they keep it on file so they know what to work on for you,-They explain everything and answer any questions that I have. Easy to understand. They even have iPads to show you stuff online.-They give advice for your daily beauty routine. What are good things to do, what are bad things to do-They use great products on you-The place is really nice - looks elegant, clean, comfy-The people are pleasant and always nice to chat with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adidaben
40,My skin never looked so good!,"When you go into Vine Vera you no longer feel like you are part of the craziness of the mall. It is a relaxed environment. Someone greets you and asks you if you'd like a beverage, this person pays attention to you, even gives you a little tour of the location. The first time you go there they will have you will complete a facial questionnaire. I am glad that they do this. Its important for them to know about my skin before applying stuff to it, right? Right!Its a nice look place. Other places I've had facials are usually in someones house or very homey look, which isn't necessarily bad... but Vine Vera is NICE. It looks well designed, like a high end luxury designer store. You know the ones you pass and dream of going on a shopping spree at? There are little set ups all over with comfy chairs and skins where they show different skin care products. I got to get my facial in the back in the ""VIP"" room. It's like a secret oasis in the back with one of those super comfy full length leather reclining chairs. Mmmm :)Dimitri was the one who did my facial, he was very nice. He put stuff on my skin and left for a whlie, he told me it is for it to skin into my skin. It was great for me to have time to relax and and just enjoy the experience without a stranger in the room. Also that seemed to really do the trick for my skin. It looked so glowy afterwards.Ya the price for going to Vine Vera is not so cheap but what good things in life are? As they say, you get what you pay for. The cool things is you can get discounts for signing up for the VIP program. So check that out. You're welcome ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OriE11
50,Skincare done right!!,"Awesome! Before visiting Vine Vera and being helped by the sweet and super helpful girl there (cant remember her name, ugh!) my face was not looking its best. I have uneven skin and am starting to see wrinkles showing up on my skin. Usually I only visit places after reading a lot of reviews but I happened upon this location and got sucked in. I was walking by and when someone near the door offered me a skincare sample. I took it and was looking at it (they give you a little bag with the sample inside - super cute) when he told me to come in the store so he could show me something for a moment. So in I went, not yet knowing anything about Vine Vera. Just what I was needing, I thought to myself. I was gonna go check reviews online before letting people touch my face but it all happened so quick! Next thing I know he is introducing me to the girl that will be taking care of me, than being lead to a ""VIP"" room. I do not regret it one bit! The VIP room was very clean and tidy and looked really professional. There was a big reclining chair/bed in the middle that I got to lay on - very comfy. After this whirlwind experience I have been back several times and I can confidently say that my skin is looking a lot better. I am wearing less and less makeup these days because I don't need it any more. Yey Vine Vera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sseevv
50,Vine Vera ... I love it!,"Did i say how much i love it? :) i have been to several different Vine Vera's locations and I always enjoy my experiences. This one is very close to where i work sometimes, which makes it convenient. Before you even walk in you already feel special ... the decoration only its very fancy. Very classy design but not too much. Once you are in the store someone greets you and it ready to help you right away with anything you need. They are all hight tech, the staff uses fancy tablets to explain the products. Pretty cool.My skin has experiences a total change since i started using the products, i even gotten compliments about it. I remember the first time they asked me few general questions about my skin and personal routine and what would i like to fix about my skin? instead of just telling me what i need, like in other stores.What i like the best is the Resveratrol. I've researched and it is serious stuff and amazingly good for you; another reason why I love Vine Vera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634bees
40,My skin loves Vine Vera!,"Walking in the mall a while ago, I was passing a Vine Vera when a nice person standing near the door offered me a free sample. I had never heard of Vine Vera and had no clue what they were giving me a sample of.. it was a little elegant looking plastic bag with something inside. The guy invited me into the store to learn more. I was intrigued so in I went. Once I went inside I realized that Vine Vera does skin care. I was invited to try them out with a complimentary facial. Who can say no to that, right? First I saw seated with a beauty consultant who asked me some questions and talked to me about my skin. Than she discussed with me what the best things would be for my skin as far as products and treatments. Next she led me to the ""VIP room"" for my facial. My facial was about half an hour long and super relaxing. I really enjoyed it. The girl doing the facial was very gentle and it felt nice when she was massaging different creams on my face. After the facial was over she explained all the steps to me and how I could replicate the process at home. I liked it so much I bought some products to take home with me. I was a very enjoyable experience and I am planning to return soon and do it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Efibiton
50,Gotta love Vine Vera!,"Recently visited a Vine Vera location and wanted to tell yall about it. First of all it looks pretty nice, modern stylish design. I didnt expect that a place that looks like this would be a skin care company. I came in for a facial and I really enjoyed it. My friend and I got our facials together in the VIP room. We got to lay in comfy lounge chairs side by side while getting our facials. I thought we would be able to chat and catch up but turns out that doesnt work. Getting a Vine Vera facial is too relaxing for talking. I had to sit back and just enjoy. I guess I will need to reschedule that chat with my friend :) The guy doing my facial was really nice and sounded really knowledgeable. Before doing the facial we had a short chat about my skin and if there is anything I'd like to improve. After he did my facial he went over everything he used on my skin and why. I've had several facials before and I really appreciate it when someone goes over everything with me. Not only does it make me feel more comfortable to know what is happening with my skin but it helps me continue a skin care routine at home. To sum up: Vine Vera facials are relaxing, the person who helped me was nice. Go check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arkidru
50,"Firm, Glowing Skin!!","I'm a skincare junkie and I love checking out new spas, treatments, and products to improve my skin. Vine Vera was my newest adventure and I love their products! I was shopping at Santa Anita mall and got invited into the Vine Vera store. They have very friendly and knowledgable staff that introduced me to ""resveratrol"" which is the star ingredients in their skincare line. I got to enjoy an one hour firming and anti-aging treatment facial at this location. After the relaxing treatment, my skin looked so tight, firm...and the glow...omg...the glow. I would definitely recommend to stop by Vine Vera if you have a chance. Say hello to beautiful, younger skin!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lena724
50,Awesome experience,"Finally found something that makes shopping with my girlfriend suck less. She keeps convincing me, who knows how, to go with her to the mall. Not my idea of fun but she loves it. So shes dragging me around from store to store. At some point I end up inside a Vine Vera. No idea what this place is or what we are doing there. Suddenly I hear words like facial, treatment... interesting. I barely put in the effort to put sunblock or lotion on my face let alone getting a facial but yet again my girlfriend convinces me. So off we go to a special ""VIP"" room in the back. I was very skeptical and not looking forward to this experience. I already got dragged into the mall, I didn't think anything there could be pleasant. Well I was wrong! The VIP room has these big comfy chairs that look like pool lounge chairs but with comfy cushions. I got to relax on the lounge chair while someone rubbed stuff on my face. I am not really sure what she put on there even though she explained everything because I was waaaaay too relaxed to pay attention. All I know is if you feel stressed or annoyed this is the perfect way to forget your problems. Anyways, when we are done with the VIP room my girlfriend is so amazed with how ""glowing"" my skin looked that she bought me some face cream. I dunno what this ""glowing"" nonsense is but I would not object to experiencing a facial again for sure.;) ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelpQ4626WQ
50,Loved itttttt :),"Recently checked out a Vine Vera location… it was pretty awesome. I was walking by with a girlfriend when we were invited in to check out their facilities. On a whim we decided to go in. The gentleman helping us was sweet and super helpful. I’ve been meaning to revamp my skin care routine and I was planning to get a facial and ask for recommendations on how to better care for my skin so this seemed like destiny, lol. I feel so much smarter after this experience. I try to read up on skin care and the best things to use for skin but I never felt like I had a good understanding of it. This guy (unfortunately I can’t remember his name!!  ) explained things to me and made it so easy to understand. He created a facial for me specially addressed to my needs. I have some dark spots left over from acne and that was something I wanted help with. He explained to me what these were caused by and the best way to treat them. During my facial he used products specifically targeted to reducing dark spots. So back to my story, my girlfriend and I came in, we started asking questions and we were invited to the VIP room for a treatment. That was amazing. It is a special room in the back and we both got facials together! It was relaxing and super fun. And as I already said super informative. Both my girlfriend and I felt like our skin was very well taken care of. We will be back again soon for another facial; loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlgaRonis
40,Awesome facial,"I can't believe no one has ever told me about this place! I went in for the first time this week and I can tell you now that I will definitely be back. Who knew you could actually get relaxed in the mall? They used the Chianti mask on me which gave my skin a nice warm sensation. The girl said the warmth helps to open your pores. Well whatever it did, everyone else sure seemed to notice! Now I'm telling all my friends to check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMaureen350
40,Thank you Vine Vera!,"My friend Vicky suggested this place a few months ago and while we were in the Santa Anita Mall, I couldn't resist the opportunity. First of all, what a great location. It looks so modern and clean. I loved it! I was excited because the service was great. I was treated like a regular customer.We got facials from the skin care specialist. As she used products on my face, she made sure that she explained everything she was using. She answered all my questions and knew everything about the ingredients in the products! That was amazing in itself. I was just happy that it felt great and looked great afterwards. My skin has never felt better. I highly recommend them.I would definitely come here again. It is a great place to unwind and enjoy, especially after a day of shopping. It completes any girl's day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresag35
50,So relaxing and a very knowledgeable staff!,"I rarely review places online, but I had to share after having such a nice experience over at the Vine Vera spa in the Santa Anita Mall. Let's start by saying that I wasn't out for a day of spoiling, but I just couldn't resist! The staff was incredible and beyond knowledgeable. There was an answer for every question I had in regards to their methods and their use. Part of the experience is a facial in their beautiful facilities. The experience was beyond relaxing and quite informative. They analyze your skin to determine what products will suit you best. I appreciate the fact that they know exactly what ingredients make up their formulas and how they benefit your skin and in what ways. They also know the optimum way to mix them with other ones to maximize results. After just one visit my skin felt and looked amazing! Above all, they were all very friendly and made the whole experience very pleasant. I can tell you that my visit was worth every penny, my skin is glowing! I feel like I found my new favorite beauty provider. Thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3danielav
50,Highly recomended !,"I was dying to get a facial but hadn’t been able to find the time. I asked some girlfriends if they knew a place where I can get a quick facial. One of my friends recommended Vine Vera so I went to try it out. As soon as I step foot inside someone greeted me right away. This girl was smiling and seemed very happy to see me. She asked if I had come in for a facial and I said that I did. She took me to one of the facial areas and had me sit down in a big comfy chair. First, she told me, she would ask me some questions about my skin so we could decide what is the best type of facial for me. I was surprised she wanted to ask me questions cuz I haven’t really been interviewed before a facial. She explained that there is a variety of techniques and products which can be used so they ask questions to narrow it down. So I told her about my skin, what were my biggest issues, what type of skin do I have, do I have any skin conditions. After this she told me what she would be using, what would be best for my skin. She left for a couple minutes to get all the supplies she needed. She came back and began the facial. She has a gentle touch and explained everything she was doing as she was going. It was a nice facial though I would have loved for it to be longer. I didn’t want it to end! My skin looked very glowy afterwards which I really liked. I’m sure this was partly because my usual facials include extractions but this one didn’t. If you are looking for a relaxing and pleasant facial you should come here. If you are looking for extractions and a more medical approach with machines and procedures that must be administered by nurses, do not come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hagara90
40,Awesome Skincare,"I was doing a day of shopping at the Santa Anita mall when I walked by Vine Vera (girl time!). One of the staff by the door invited me in. I looooooove skin products so I decided to take a look. The store was very clean looking and I liked the fact that there wasn't a lot of clutter in oppose to beauty supply stores. Usually I don't like when sales people following me around but the young lady was explaining things about the products as she walked me in. They offered me a free facial as it was my first time in the store, yaiiii! Adding a facial to my day was excellent! I had the facial done in a private, relaxing room (awesome) and the girl was explaining everything she was doing. It wasn't the kind of facial I usually get (no extractions and it wasn't an hour long...), but for a free facial it was great and nothing to complain about. I got a facial massage using the stores products and my skin felt GREAT ! Even though I left with no makeup (cause they had removed it for the facial) my skin looked good so it was fine :-) I looked like someone retouched my skin and everything was a bit tighter and smoother. It seemed like she knew exactly what to use on my skin. It made my day. I really wish I could remember the girls name so I can thank her, well, hopefully she will be there next time I come by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543kerenw
