50,Great Small Theater with Top Actors.,"The Geffen Playhouse, located in Westwood in Los Angeles, is a great venue to see a play. They have original plays and the best touring plays as well. You are also going to be able to see some of the best actors working at the Geffen. Andy Garcia was there this year, for example.The theater is small so get your tickets early. I suggest getting there very early and finding parking and then go have a meal or just walk the Westwood Village. It is adorable and some of the eateries are great.You can find the Geffen on line and buy for a single show are a series. You will not be disappointed. We saw the story of Nat King Cole there and it was magical. There is not a bad seat in the house. The prices are reasonable. Go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Marvelous play...parking- not so much,"The production of Key Largo was very well done. The stage, the sound effects and lighting were top notch. The Geffen is a beautiful building. My only complaint on the Geffen itself was that the seats were not that comfortable. I sat on my jacket to soften the seat somewhat. We paid $155 per ticket so I was a little surprised on that issue. The other problem was the confusion with the parking. We followed the suggestion on the Geffen website and found the parking by the Trader Joe’s. When the play was over, we had some problems with the payment machine in the parking structure. It charged full price even though we had a validated ticket from the playhouse. The parking attendant was no help. The line behind us started forming so we decided to just go ahead and pay full price. ($22). The machine still gave us a hard time. It took 2 credit cards to finally get out of there. A stressful end to a nice evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tara360
50,The Thanksgiving Play,"The Geffen Theatre is one of the best in Los Angeles, located in beautiful Westwood near UCLA. They do good work. This play was written by a Native American playwright featuring a group of people getting together during Thanksgiving and, at the same time, during Native American Heritage week. This juxtaposition creates some natural conflict. Well written by playwright Larissa Fasthorse -- yes, that's her real name -- and wonderfully acted and directed as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adryan2013
50,Witch is a HIT at the Geffen! Loved this play!,"Going to the Geffen is a great thing to do with visiting company, family or friends here. I see a lot of plays in LA and few theatres have the track record of choosing the variety of what has been showing up here. Like going out to dinner, a favorite restaurant is as important as a favorite theatre experience.Witch is on the menu. This wonderful take on witches, devils, souls along with the state of the world (then and now) is written with great comedic aplomb by Jen Silverman. It’s just in time for the Harvest season.We quickly find that Elizabeth (Maura Tierney) is a banished woman who has been assigned the title of a witch. Sir Arthur decides to bring in a lesser class son, local Frank Thorney so he’ll produce an heir. Arthur’s son, Cuddy (Will Von Vogt) likes/loves/hates Frank and won’t be producing an heir anytime soon but the jealous rivalry between the two makes for fantastic fodder.Everyone seems to have a secret or want to sell their soul quickly to the devilishly handsome, Scratch (Evan Jonigkeit). He’s a devil who has had many forms and he’s collecting souls in exchange for promised deeds (which he forgets to do the paperwork on). Scratch is more of a devil-in-training. Instead of fire he actually has heart - an interesting take on a very old tale.There are so many intertwining personal scenarios and agendas going on within this dark comedy. Theatre is food for the thought and rich conversation afterwards. The question of what would you exchange your soul for if any? But with the added twist that this is no ordinary devil – had my friend and I laughing but also feeling good about an evening out in Westwood.Elizabeth surprises Scratch by saying no to selling her soul initially and by the end we realize she was willing to all along but the two do a dance of seeing one another for who they are not who they are presented as - in terms of labels. She’s not really the witch and Scratch is changed deeply by their interactions – or being off the books.Witch succeeds on every level. The set has the upper class world set with a huge table that expands out and retreats to give us the intimate moments where Elizabeth lives. Barefoot in the dirt. Is there hope for our world?The Geffen has two theatres and I'm always mesmerized by how quickly they create an entirely new environment with an incoming show. Good, bad or indifferent. Usually, great.Kudos to cast, playwright and every designer connected to this project.If you’ve got friends coming into town, do NOT miss this show. Bring them. Your stomach will hurt from laughing. My older friend said, “This is funny!” during a moment in the play and we were up front. The actor playing Scratch the devil thanked him and the laughs went on from there.It’s an affordable night and is local to many of our suburbs.It's easy parking and again, affordable. There isn't a break but the 95 minutes fly by.So much is within walking distance before and after a show to eat, see or drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMFredric
50,"Comfortable Vibe, Intimate Playhouse Theatre❤️❤️❤️","This is 1 of my fave theatres.Helpful ticket staff, variety of different shows, comfortable neighbourhood vibe, and I believe all seating is good. Great venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/303
50,Charming and Intimate,"It is a great venue to have an up close experience with the performances. The charming entry courtyard is perfect for a pre-show glass of wine or snack. Not being a local, it is worth an hour drive to see a play here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdsaction
50,Gotta Love the Geffen,"We love the Geffen. It is a medium sized, very pleasant theatre that does totally professional work. Near-by parking is available and there are several good restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998judyw
50,A Christmas Carol (December 2018) and Nat King Cole Musical (February 2019),"For experienced theatre-goers, A Christmas Carol was a Tour de Force; for newbies to theatre, set a high bar of pleasure and sheer enjoyment. Them the Geffen followed it up with the Nat King Cole Musical and we were all blown away (again) by Duke Hill. The score, performance and joy we felt, singing along and remembering one of the greats and his music, Nat King Cole is not to be missed as it runs through March.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChaplainDOV
50,Great little venue,This is a great place to see a show. It is cozy and all seats are great. They bring great productions that are perfectly priced. Great for taking the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magfamily2016
50,Consistently Good Productions,"Wonderful place to see a play if you are a LA resident or a visitor. Actually consists of two theatres, the Gil Cates Theatre and the smaller Audrey Skirball Kenis Theatre. They offer about 10-12 productions a year. Have been Geffen subscribers for many years and have always been impressed by the quality of the productions. Virtually all seats are excellent and the seating is quite comfortable. Parking is very convenient in the numerous parking lots located very close to the Playhouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/springpa
50,Not a bad seat in the house,"We have been subscribers to the Geffen Playhouse for years. Here is why. Although we find at least one production each year that we think is unbelievably bad, the majority of the productions are wonderfully rewarding, and even a terrible play is a good night at the theater if you are stimulated by experiencing live art and the critical discussion that follows. The venue doesn't have a bad seat, and the audiences are always considerate. A few of the productions have been once-in-a-lifetime experiences, never to be forgotten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aronl785
40,Very Nice Community Theare,"Not a bad seat in the house. Staff is a little curt, but they are probably students. Production was excellent and the price was perfect, with a great selection for dining nearby. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatrinkaSD
50,Excellent theatre and great production,It’s obvious in just one visit that this community supported Theatre is something special. The program detailing how donations allow extra rehearsals is inspiring. The physical attributes of spacious seats and plenty of leg room is much appreciated. The production we saw tonight CHASING MEM’RIES was outstanding with a really superb Tyne Daly quite unforgettable. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
50,Love Downton Abbey?,"Allan Leech(tom) and Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy hopps in Zootoopia are currently starring in a two actor play- 'constellations'at the Geffen playhouse. Mr Leech gets to show off his acting chops as a beekeeper who falls in a love with a nerdy physicist How much time do we have and our infinite daily choices are the major themes in this heartbreaking performance. Ms Goodwin's performance is fabulous, as well They make a great team. Only in LA can you see great performances by great actors in a small venue. Through the 26th of July",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmichaudsilver
50,Wonderful production of Actually,I saw Actually there -- it was an amazing play and performance. The space (the smaller of the two theaters) was perfect. An intimate setting but a large stage giving the actors and directors plenty of options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott95401
50,Always something interesting here!,"Just saw a production of Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" with Jane Kaczmarek and Alfred Molina lighting up the stage. I love the venue and visit as often as I can. very comfortable seating, with great stage views. The theater has a small stage more suitable for experimental plays and the main stage, perfect for the more traditional productions. I highly recommend you go see a play while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
50,"Two theaters, one location.","The Geffen houses two theatres in one building. I have seen many great performances here including Annette Bening in a one woman show in the larger theatre and Ben Scheuer in ""The Lion"" in the smaller theatre. You can get discounted tickets at goldstar.com or try to get rush tickets the day of the performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeisatraveler
50,Fantastic Venue for Theatre,"Saw ""Barbaque"" here and laughed through most of it. All of the actors were phenomenal and we really enjoyed the production. The theater was nice and charming. Seats aren't all that comfortable but it didn't ruin the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishgirl8253
30,In and Of Itself: Interesting show but not a very comfortable theatre.,"Though it was fun to attend a show at the famous Geffen Playhouse and the show was interesting, the tiny side theatre was not comfortable. The theatre has rather steep steps upward to chairs that are like cheep metal folding chairs but they are all connected together. The seats don't fold up so there is only a tiny space to walk through to get to your seat (if you are on the inside and not the aisle). If a heavier person wiggles in their seat, your seat will move down the line. If someone needs to get out, the whole row would need to get up and move to let them out because there is absolutely no aisle space. We managed ok as the show was only about an hour with no intermission. We had good attitudes and are healthy people so it worked out fine for us. This review is to let readers know that this is a ""no-frills"" theatre so go and have a good time but be warned that it is very cramped. Frankly, I wondered if the theatre is to code. If there was a fire, it would be pretty terrifying and dangerous to try to get out.With that said, the steep seating allows for a good view even from the back row. This particular show In and Of Itself was decent and has some interactive elements. It received excellent reviews so I was expecting a bit more. Go with low expectations and you might be delighted. It is admirable that the one man is both writer and actor. He tells an interesting story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wethrivelife
50,Big Sky - Excellent,"We have a subscription to the Geffen and we just saw Big Sky. It was an outstanding performance. Well written, engaging, entertaining and poignant all at the same time. The casting was spot on and the cast's performance was engaging. Definitely worth attending.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshPhD
50,Always an interesting show,"This is one of my favorite theatrical venues. Right now there is a really intriguing magic show, that I'm going to see for the second time next week. The dark comedy that premiered here last month is still running and it's a wonderful, high quality production, that leaves a view thinking, ""If only...."". The theater makes an effort to support new plays, and provides a beautiful setting, right across the street from UCLA. It's worth your while to check in at the box office before a play to find out if there are rush seats available and what you might need to do to get them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,Best Theater in Los Angeles,"I love the Geffen Playhouse and have been a patron for years. The ambiance is wonderful. The space is small so all comfy seats provide a terrific view of the action on stage. The plays and talent are top rated with recognizable performers. There are special offerings during the run of a play. For instance, I attended a Girl's Night last week with a gathering on the patio featuring small bites, a bar and desserts, including a dj and other activities following the performance. What a treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaR824
50,We saw Big Sky,"If you can see a play at the Geffen, absolutely do it. I've been a subscriber to the Saturday matinée for 20 Yrs during preview week. Prices are lower and rarely you'll hear a mistake. Plus u still have plenty of time afterward to get a lovely meal. This play, Big Sky was outstanding. It explained that in life, we all have something for which to atone. The best way to do it, starting with your own family and close friends, is to listen and become part of the team. Do not retreat to your own corner. There's a lot swearing which my 88 year old mother-in-law didn't particularly care for (she said ""do they really have to say the ""ph- word"" in every sentence?"" But we all thought the performances were terrific. The Geffen usually have rush tickets that u can buy for $25, 15 min before a performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/405hollys
50,Great magic show,I've seen other plays here but never a magic showThe theater is intimate and every seat is a good seatThe parking garage close by was convenient,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107cl
50,Great theater!,"The Geffen provides a Broadway experience without going to New York. Sometimes there are famous actors and actresses from film and television, but sometimes the unknowns will provide the most memorable experience. I love this theater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmichaudsilver
50,"Alive, Live and Excellent",Visited the Geffen to see the outstanding production of Louis & Keely Alive at the Sahara. Loved every minute. Wish it was there for a longer run. Saw the first version a few years ago and this was as good...maybe better.Charming theater built in 1929.2 stages and both are wonderful.We will visit this jewel box again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hyflyingbee
50,Love It Live!,"Introduced my Pasadena based daughter and her husband to this gem of a playhouse because the show ""Louis & Keely: Live at the Sahara"" looked so enticing to me. It was also my first visit to the venue. Wow! What's not to love? The Gil Cates theater is great and this particular show just sizzles! A very impressive performance in a setting that gave us a night to remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298jerryl
50,Wonderful Venue,"In town on vacation, we attended two performances at the Geffen: Rita Wilson's cabaret-style ""Line Notes"" and John Patrick Shanley's ""Outside Mullingar"" in the main theater. Both performances were extremely well-done and very enjoyable. The Geffen is a wonderful venue. Very laid back and comfortable. Just prior to the Rita Wilson performance we received a call from the Geffen advising us there had been a cancellation of seats better than ours, wanting to know if we would like to upgrade at no extra cost. We very much appreciated their attention. Would love to go back next time we are in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecouple
50,Not a bad seat in the house (in either of the houses),Yes yes yesThere is not a bad seat in this comfortable theater or the smaller theaterSeats are wide with room for arms and legs.I've seen performances in both rooms. This time I'm in the larger theater (gil cates).Lobby and patio have plenty of space for relaxed conversation prior to play and during intermission.Parking is easy right next door.Lots of dining choices in Westwood area as well as nearby Sawtelle or BH,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,So much fun!!!! Great find close to UCLA,"This is a beautiful Playhouse that we happen to walk by one evening when we were in the area.The staff helped us with great seats to see the play ""These Paper Bullets"" We arrived at 7:30 to purchase rush tickets, ( 1/2 the price). We ended up with great seats and loved the play. The wine before and at intermission was excellent. They also offered a cheese plate that looked wonderful.We had so much fun we hope to plan a trip back to the Geffen Playhouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pam1234168

50,A Gem in LA,Attended Hershey Felder show last month and it was fabulous. A great evening for all ages. I only wish their were better restaurant choices within walking distance. Hope to attend more shows this year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KGross818
40,Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin,"As season subscribers for years, we regularly enjoy plays at this small jewel box of a theater. The current production is perfect for the holidays. Felder sings, plays the piano, and tells the very moving story of the great composer who wrote White Christmas, God Bless America, Always, There's No Business Like Show Business, and many, many more songs. There was something quite magical about the whole audience singing White Christmas together at the end. There isn't a bad seat in the theater downstairs (there's also an upstairs and I've been told those seats are also good). There are two lovely patios and disability access. Parking for subscribers is free at a nearby garage about a block away or there is paid parking in the next door garage. If you're not a subscriber, stop at the desk and ask for a discounted parking card. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Nice bar with drinks and bites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
50,Wonderful Venue,"The Geffen is one of my most favorite theaters. It's small and intimate and always has productions that are well worth (for us) the long drive from Laguna Beach. It usually takes 1 1/12 hours to get there during the week--and sometimes even longer- so my only complaint is that it's not close by. Otherwise, I'd be a season ticket holder in a minute!Last night we saw Hersey Felder in Irving Berlin and it was just wonderful–as are many of the productions in this little gem of a theater. Great location with many good restaurants close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SylviaPowers

50,Great venue,"We live in LA and always see a few shows a year at the Geffen. Really pleasant place to see a performance. It's not a big theatre, so there really aren't any bad seats.There's a very comfortable patio to relax on beforehand, and Westwood's an easy place to walk around for a meal before or after.Also they do a good job of making the property handicapped accessible because a large portion of their subscribers are elderly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA-LONDON-NYC
50,Great small venue,"We saw Slowgirl here last week-end. We haven't been in many years and this is a great theatre experience. William Peterson, (Gil Grissom, CSI) was amazing and the theatre is so intimate that you really get to appreciate his amazing persona. Also, if you arrive 30 minutes before the show, tickets are half price. Students $10 w/id. Highly recommend...and Westwood is a fun place to explore before or after the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BnRLovetosail
30,"Nice house,mixed quality","I have seen some interesting shows here.It still suffers from the LA curse, it's supposed to be about the show not the performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Offbway
40,great production of American Buffalo,"Luscious wisteria draped over the arched entrance, ivy clinging on garden walls, and a tiled fountain in the courtyard -- refreshing and delightful! It looks and feels more like the main house of a hacienda. There was quite a crowd mingling about sipping wine. It fells like a garden party!4.25.13 - We saw a great production of American Buffalo written by David Mamet. Very impressive set design, great lighting, and convincing acting. Two thumbs up! We love the unusual venue too! No wonder they attract 130,000 patrons a year. Bravo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,"Great little theatre, always fun to go there","I love going to this theatre, it is right in the center of Westwood with many options for dinner and drinks.

50,Good theatre,"I saw ""By The Way, Meet Vera Stark"" the other night. The Geffen consists of two theatres and there's always a high quality of production. The theatre is located in Westwood Village where there are lots of restaurants, and if you're looking for an out-of-town paper, there's an international newspaper/magazine stand in the Village, on Westwood Boulevard, north of Wilshire Blvd. (West side of the street). Garage parking is available next to the theatre for $7 (after 5PM). There's an open lot further down Le Conte, for $5 after 5PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikkiH890
40,Worth the visit,"I was here last month to see a play. I was very pleased by the size of the playhouse, the acoustics and the overall design. There is an outside patio where one can sit and wait for the performance. While Westwood is not known for ample parking the lot where we parked was not an unreasonable distance. The size of the theater leaves no bad seating. The quality of the playhouse's productions is consistently good-excellent. I highly recommend the place for those who love theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cloust
40,Geffen has the goods,"It's a great deal for subscription. This is my third year and have kept the same seats even though could have being ""bumped"" up. Quality productions, easy to get to and parking is available. Great for westsiders who don't want to battle traffic. Like the low key atmosphere , don't feel I need to make it a full night out . There are some quality restaurants near the Geffen but most of the eateries are geared to the UCLA students so might be smart to eat at home first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
40,Broadway Quality in LA,"This is my first season as a subscriber to the Geffen Playhouse and I have been very pleased with the quality of both the facility and the productions. Located next to the main UCLA campus, the Geffen contains two spaces, the Gil Cates Theater, seating 512, used for musicals and larger shows, and the smaller Audrey Skirball Kenis Theater, used for experimental theater and musical performances. Name stars seem to be attracted to the facility. This season we've seen Kathleen Turner, Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Jeff Daniels, Richard Chamberlain, and Brooke Shields, to name a few. The last two are current appearing in the world stage premiere of ""The Exorcist."" Yes, that one, we all saw on screen or read about. Tastefully done within a church setting, the play is more about the struggle between good and evil than special effects. Not that there aren't scary moments created effectively by the actors, the music, and the lighting. You won't regret for a moment your subscription to the 2012-2013 season (which includes free parking at a nearby garage). Extra tip: our seats are on a Sunday evening at 7:00 pm, so there is no traffic getting there...and The Geffen is kind enough to offer a free glass of local CA wine (your choice: red or white) before the performance to encourage you to arrive early and enjoy the lovely outdoor garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardJ3
