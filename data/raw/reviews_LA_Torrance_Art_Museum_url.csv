20,Missing all the wonderful local artists,"This museum used to be such a showcase for local artists,but they have changed for the worse. There are many wonderful local artists that I have seen in other shows but this place never features them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djoffino
50,one of the most interesting art venues in the LA region,"The Torrance Art Museum proved to be one of the most interesting art venues in the LA region. Finding intriguing contemporary art in Los Angeles is not easy. Most of the art museums within the LA region focus on blue chip, historical and modernist art. Truly great art gallery and museum exhibitions that focus on the cutting edge are relatively few and far between within this sprawling megacity. The Torrance Art Museum is one of a few in the LA region contemporary in the publicly funded Kunsthalle style. According to the Assistant Curator, Benjamin Tippin, their current emphasis is on art that defines the edge between digital art, sculpture and video. The director and head curator of the Torrance, Max Presneill has been named one of the “8 Best Art Curators In Los Angeles” by CBS Los Angeles . It is well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730fray
30,A supplement for a small anonymous municipality,"Very enthusiastic and accommodating person.Of course, not to be compared with the great modern art museum. The current exhibition, however, has art that makes the visit worthwhile. Not so big surfaces for artwork make it feel a bit too compressed.Commutes between high grade art and close to amateur alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
40,Easy access museum ~ FREE Parking!,This museum has some great events~ I've been a few times and it's always an enjoyable time. Many restaurants close by for a meal before or after.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
30,"Local, small...","I totally appreciate that ""art is in the eye of the beholder"", and I have only been here about three times, but all three times I found the art not too interesting. It's a great place to take students who are required to do a review, or less mobile people as it is small and you won't be overwhelmed by choices of what to look at. Parking is not a problem either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagooBeachGirl

40,Superb building for displaying Art - but what of the Art?,"A really good Modern Building with excellent display spaces.What you make of the art on display all depends on what is on - and what your own taste in Art is.We saw a comparative display - of Art from both Los Angeles and then from New York.Some of what was exhibited had been well executed and was very artistic. However the majority was ""pretty average"" to the point of being ""pretentious"".That was our view - others are more than welcome to disagree!!Free entry, donations always welcome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
