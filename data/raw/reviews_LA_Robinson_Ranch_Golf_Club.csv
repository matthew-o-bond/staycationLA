10,STAY AWAY!,"Let me begin by saying that I almost always do not review a place unless I feel I can give it four stars. If I have a bad experience, i usually am willing to chalk it up to a bad day, and just move on. What happened here, however, was not attributable to someone's bad day, or just a honest mistake. It only can be attributed to a management decision to take advantage of their customers for a short term gain, without regard to what they were doing to their reputation. Last summer Robinson Ranch was severely damaged by the California fires that were centered around Santa Clarita. I had heard they were re-opening around March 1, so I called to inquire as to whether that was true. The person in the pro shop who answered the phone told me they were, indeed, open, and everything was 'beautiful"". It is true they are open, but ""beautiful"" is about the last word I would use to describe the course's condition. Abomination is more like it. Numerous fairways are still under re-construction, with several of them having open trenches where pipes are being installed. In addition, many of the fairways have large areas without any grass whatsoever. If any of the fairways have even been cut, or otherwise cared for, it would be a surprise. The icing on the cake: they were charging full rates. If management wanted to write a manual on how to permanently lose a customer (who was playing multiple times a month before the fires), they could not have done a better job.",Stanley K
20,Could not receive a refund when cancelling a tee time reservation online.,"I've played both courses at RR Golf Club dozens of times since RR opened and like the courses. The problem has always been the RR management staff and what I'm about to describe is an example of very bad management. I recently made an online reservation for 2 players and then had to reschedule due to a friend /business associates work schedule. A couple days later I then had to completely cancel the tee time reservation because of excessive heat / temps above 100F. In short, I called the course and spoke to the club house and left a VM for the GM about a refund and the answer was a flat out ""NO"". RR Golf Course didn't lose a penny but they still charged my CC because the reservation / tee time was made online. Down through the years I've spent thousands of dollars directly and indirectly at RR Golf Club but I'll never spend another penny at RR or play the courses ever again. Also, I'll be sure to tell anyone who will listen to me about my experience. Nice way to treat repeat customers.....",JRENO777
30,"Great Course, No Water","Truly a shame as these 2 beautiful golf courses, Valley and the lesser Mountain, were once great tracks. All that has come to a screeching halt as the course has no water during this California drought, and the course is primarily dirt and tufts of half-dead grass. Kudos for keeping the greens in good shape, but many of the holes are close to unplayable as the ball bounces into bushes due to there being no grass, and definitely not much to look at. Rumor has it the course is going to go down to 3 9's, try to get some water privileges, and return to some of its former glory. Right now the mountain course is closing per the pro shop, and the Valley course will keep its poor condition until something changes. Would not visit now unless desperate for someplace to play in the Santa Clarita area.",desertduffergolf
50,Great happy hour!,Had happy hour there tonight. Beautiful views. Quiet evening. Very good wine choices. Delicious appetizers! Crab risotto balls were amazing! Veggie flat bread yummy! Sliders too! It's a nice place to go for some good eats and scenic views!,mamaduck131
40,new managment,"I am a member at this golf course but didn't like to eat here much, but the management has changed and its a lot better....had a great pork chop dinner the other night....and they have added new items...will be eating here a lot more ...",Kathleen G
50,Top quality course with spectacular views!,"If you are in the area, this course is definitely worth the visit. 36 holes of championship golf. Challenging to say the least!I played the mountain course during my visit. I scored a special on Golf Now's Deal Caddy for $39 unlimited golf. I wanted to play 36 but the rain squashed my plans.Narrow fairways, plentiful bunkers, elevation changes, and OB flanking every hole made my round a challenging endeavor. I was spraying the ball a bit, and it cost me quite a few balls to the scrub.Beautiful restaurant and bar overlook the course and gives it a real country club feel.It's a 10 in my book!",WHunkele
50,Can You Say … Perfection?,First Class treatment is something I was offered at Robinson Ranch Golf Course. The staff … the practice facility … the putting greenThe golf course was in great shape … the greens true and fast … the fairways perfection … the rough was really non-existent (but out of bounds is another matter) … the sand traps were pro-quality with light fluffy sand …There are 2 18 hole courses … I played the Valley Course only. It's narrow and someone said the PGA played here sometime ago but didn't return since the pros felt it was too tough? But I found that it was MORE THAN FAIR … just keep your drives in the fairway … DON'T SPRAY the ball and you'll have a very enjoyable experience. Desert golf … from the White T's … you don't have to be LONG OFF THE T … your approach shots will be reasonable and fun. I booked on GOLFNOW and paid a great rate for a top tier course and a challenging round of golf. I loved it and so should YOU.,Stan056
