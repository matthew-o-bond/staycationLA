50,Favorite place!,The place to go after a hard work week. Always make me feel relaxed! Sally is great. She always does a great job! I highly recommend coming here! Love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thats_netty
50,Friendly and caring staff,"I was really sick when i came in. Had a horrible cough and horrible voice. Everyone was really caring, bringing me hot water to drink, looking for cough drops, so friendly. Lynn did my nails and helped pick the cutest color. She also explained to me how my nails grew wide, so she was going to file it a little bit more narrow, gave me tips on how to control my cuticles. I'm usually really bad with Gel mani & pedi, it would start peeling after a week, but thats not the case when i come to BeautyBar, everyone does a really great job at putting on the color so the mani's last.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louH2305IP

50,"Love, Love, Love!!!","When I moved to LA it took me over a month to find a nail salon that I could call my own. Once I found BeautyBar SGV I never went anywhere else. The entire staff is super friendly and can do any design you can imagine. I love bling nails and they‚Äôre always up to the challenge of my elaborate designs. The owners (Kimi & Ben) are just freaking adorable and know the value of delivering quality service and products. All the staff are talented, warm, and friendly.

Also they are pet friendly which is a huge plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natvicent25
10,NEVER AGAIN COMING BACK TO THESE CON ARTISTS,"CON ARTISTS!! They use every trick in the book to add hidden fees. I came here for their ""flash sale"" 20% off event, I got a pedi and a mani with acrylics, gel polish, chrome effect, and almond shape. They did not clarify or ask my approval for any of these extra fees, which they should have because they charge CRAZY fees. $15 extra for gel AND $15 extra for chrome even though you already need to have gel polish in order to do chrome. To top it off, the 20% off excludes acrylic...how convenient. Worst of all, these fees are not listed ANYWHERE. The menu, the pamphlets on the counter, AND their website are all outdated, so when I asked to see why my mani came out to +$75, they said ""That's just how much it costs."" My 20% day turned out to be a *generous* $4 discount, and my bill was $100...I have come here for 3 years but after today, I will NOT come back. They didn't even seem to care how shocked I was at the price, as if they were happy they got away with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744kirstiep
50,Home away from home,"I have been coming to Beauty Bar for several years, the service is awesome and always on point, this is my home away from home, the owners Kimi and Ben are always so welcoming, and also the staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgonzalez7074
20,Full set and pedicure,I loved the place but I didn‚Äôt like the person doing my nails. I got a full set and a pedicure and I was there for 2 hours. It should not take that long to get both done. Plus after I left my nails got messed up so I paid around $68 for nothing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicapina1714
50,Great Service,I really like the service at Beauty The personal is friendly and attentive. Sometimes they send emails with offers and special events to help clients save money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7737KYmaria
40,Always room for improvement.,"My overall experience was good but there was a few things that could have been better for example, the lady that started my pedicure left to start another clients manicure and didn‚Äôt tell me, she just asked someone else to finish my pediü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My manicure was ok I wasn‚Äôt 100% satisfied with the final shape of the nails but overall they look descent. I think once the ladies get used to your hand and nails their work gets better. Will I go back? Yes the ladies were nice, specially the one that finished my pedicure. I didn‚Äôt catch her name but she was really nice and did a great job putting on the polish on my nails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soledadgmz
