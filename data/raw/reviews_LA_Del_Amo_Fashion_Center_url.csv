40,Variety to Boot!,"We love Del Amo mall and miss living in the South Bay as it was an easy go-to. Lots of great shopping options, Cinema and restaurants; the upgraded Food Court is great with something for everyone. HANDS DOWN the Genghis Khan there has THE BEST Mongolian Grill that we have had Anywhere! It was the first meal we had when we got back to Los Angeles! This mall is great to spend an hour or two or the whole day! The only reason I did not give it 5 Stars was that there was no Christmas Music or real 'Holiday Feel"" the last Christmas I shopped there. I love a mall at the Holidays and while I got my shopping done, it was not the festive event it could have been. Other than that, this mall has everything you need and still (I believe) ranks in the Top 10 most visited malls in America. Not bad at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404panag
40,Got it All,We specifically booked our hotel close to the center because clothes shopping was our aim before heading home to Australia. As it turned out we weren't disappointed as we found everything we wanted and more. From all the great department stores to small boutiques and everything inbetween. spent 3 full days just roaming through all the stores and food was abundant here too. From some vendors scattered inbetween other stores to the large food court to outside stores and restaurants . Great experience glad we came.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/our56
40,Fine for a small town,"Good:pick-up service for orders placed onlineall the standard brands plus Sears, Nordstrom and Macy's in one placeBad:Too huge. You really need to walk a LOT. So if you see something, buy it, otherwise you'll end walking miles and miles to get back to that store.Macy's Women's Shoes & Bags section was a major disappointment. Very small, limited brands, limited options, limited sizes. Out of 10 pairs, they didn't have anything in my size and didn't even offer to order online and pick it up later on. The staff overall seemed uninterested in you as a customer. The bag section was just awful. Very messy, bags on top of other bags, very dusty shelving. Again, limited options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burntfalafel

I wear a pedometer and count my steps, and feel comfortable racking up the count at this mall. Parking is ample, stores and eateries are plentiful. I often stop at one of the three Starbucks for a beverage, and Nordstrom's Ebar for a beverage/nosh. Occasionally, my husband and I dine at Luna Grill. The mall has stores I like (e.g., Macy's, Ecco, and Nordstrom) and is kept clean. When I choose to go to a movie with my husband, we prefer the AMC theatre at this mall. I have one issue that really needs to be resolved: dogs of all sizes, some of which I have seen poop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tapbelle

It is located 10-15 minutes south of LAX, in the L.A. suburb of Torrance, which is consistently ranked among the safest cities in America.

I ordered shrimp and noodles. Very good. And the bok choy was outstanding. Be careful with the green tea. Its very high quality but sent me to the ladies room, if you know what I mean.

30,Not As Good As It Used To Be,"The last time I was at Del Amo Fashion Center was 1997. Back then, this mall was simply amazing. It was also larger than what it is today. The mall itself has a nice feel to it but there are not that many good retail stores to choose from and the layout is very confusing. The food court has good options but I just wish they had more selections of stores to shop from. Maybe I am just a relic of the past...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6313QUjamesk
50,Great sekection,"All your favourite brands and chain shops here, great layout - very airy and spacious.

40,A Rebirth,"Del Amo Fashion Center has become the place to go for top end stores, easy access, plenty of parking and as a central location with plenty of restaurants. Having an AMC movie complex as part of the Fashion Center just adds to the draw. The owners have moved from north to south in redeveloping and cleaning up the Fashion Center which had started to show its age badly. Now, the facility competes with anything in West Los Angeles or the Valley. The owners are continuing the massive face lift at the south end of the complex and when finished will be a gem for the South Bay, although the north portion that is completed makes it the place to go for shopping and entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanK67

The mall also has varying styles. It's interesting to walk from one end to the other and see it transition styles. My favorite part is the outdoor mall. There's a fountain and lights strung up. It's quite nice to sit out there and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009

50,Large Mall with The Big Dept Stores and Food,"We all know there are too many malls in some parts of the US and big department stores are suffering, some are just thin on stock as a result. So if you want something in particular you can be unlucky. We found (as tourists from Oz) this was one of the better ones. Macey, Nordstrom, JCPenney are there along with a Sears but we didn't go in the last one. Also great food at Lucille's and a BJ Brewhouse. Liked the food, atmosphere and prices in both of them and in fact visited them both twice. Also a Barnes and Noble and a big cinema. Plenty of parking, including a big undercover area for those days when you don't want to leave your car in the sun (as a tourist I can confirm that two hours in a hot car does chocolate no good at all) No review of a mall can cover everything and we were just looking for clothes but I rate this as one of the best in the district for normal shops (best outlets was probably San Clemente)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNSydney_Australia

40,Great mall,This place is spaced out which is great. No narrow hallways where people have to fight each other to move through. Some malls are not as stroller friendly as Del Amo.Best part about Del Amo is the DAVIDsTEA store. I had been to Teavana before but the selection from this store is great!

They have Zara, Uniqlo, Lululemon, Banana Republic, H&M. One thing that is missing is an Apple store.They opened a Din Tai Fung in this wing, and that alone is worth the visit if you like Taiwanese dumplings. Frida's Mexican restaurant is also a decent dinner spot. I haven't tried the other restaurants, but they look inviting.The movie theater is pretty cool because it's clean and doesn't get very crowded unless you're watching on opening weekend.

40,Work in progress,"The new section on the north end has turned out very nice and I'm looking forward to what they do to the south end. If you want to walk the whole mall before the stores officially open, you're out of luck. You have to go through Macy's in the middle and it's closed until 9AM on Friday-Saturday, 10AM on Monday-Thursday and 11AM on Sunday, so before then, you have to go outside, cross the street and re-enter the mall on the other side. Would be nice if they would have some sort of way to walk the whole mall before Macy's opens and not have to go through Macy's. Maybe because they're a major anchor store they have an agreement that it won't happen, but it sure would be nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63

50,Del Amo Mall....You've Come a LONG Way!!,"I used to frequent this mall back in the 80's and 90's before moving to Las Vegas. I came for a visit recently and all I can say is....MIND BLOWN! The update on the mall, while sad in a nostalgic way for me, was done very well. Actually, stunning. Modern design, more upscale shops.... you can't even recognize the old bones that were shaved down and repurposed. Well done.I love the fact that there is now a Nordstrom here as well. Back in my day, one would have to go all the way to South Bay Galleria or even South Coast Plaza for a Nordstrom. But no longer. Everything you need shopping wise is all under one roof now.The northern end of the mall has pretty much completed it's renovation, so renovation of the southern end is probably the last step in this redevelopment process. Another thing that I found was great was the fact that there is an outdoor promenade wing. The landscaping is beautiful and is anchored by an AMC movie theater and Lucky Strike Bowl.Good for you Del Amo. You've come a long way! Definitely going to be a shopping destination for me whenever I'm back in Torrance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaAllen
40,Great Mall,"My husband and I have stopped at this mall twice now. We drive down to Torrance to hit the Target (by Del Amo) and Marshalls since we don't care for the Culver City mall. The prices at the Westfield Culver City Target seem higher, plus the mall is too crowded for our liking.I would like to point out, that on both of our trips, we arrived at Del Amo Fashion Center at opening time on a weekend. Parking was great at that time, but by the time we left in the early afternoon, the lot gets too busy.The mall itself is quite beautiful and so bright with much natural light.There are a good mix of shops at various price points. We especially enjoyed the movie theater. Our absolute favorite shop is Book Off, we have picked up so many discount DVDs and books here! If you love music, check out the $1 CD section.Other great stores are the Marshalls, lots of good deals to be had here. I am also a fan of the Old Navy for basic staple items, you can usually pick up some good discounts here as well.Haven't dined at any of the restaurants here. I did notice that at 1pm on a weekend day, the food court is packed and there are a lot of long lines.We do like this mall a lot and will surely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
20,A beautiful waste of space,"First parking is bad, yes you can park in the garage, but its a long walk to Macys, and the worst directional signs I have every found in a public place. The signs are hard to read, too small, and they are so narrow, one person can block everyone else. And you have to get up close to understand where each store by number is located. Rest rooms are down exit hallways that you aren't sure where it is taking you. And for me a man, there is not a store for my interest. The mall is beautiful, but it is confusing, and finding what store you want can take alot of your shopping time away. I will not shop there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dizzydazz

There are loads of all sorts of small boutique type stores but make no mistake...these are all geared to attract and please the under 30 crowd.If you're a woman, 50 or older, your choices are slim with Nordstrom and Macy's mostly. Would have been a whole lot better had they been able to add a Dillards to this mall.It was a whole lot of walking with very little for us over 50....disappointing at best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941JudyC

50,Renovated and beautiful!,"Del Amo just re-opened it's north wing (where the old movie theaters and Montgomery Wards used to be), and it is gorgeous! Nordstrom's, Kiehls, Lush, Sephora, and other shops are now there (at least those are the ones I noticed). More shops opening soon. Nice to see a new energy and modernness to that part of the mall - connects to the already open open-air part of the mall where the AMC theaters are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAWoman_2011
