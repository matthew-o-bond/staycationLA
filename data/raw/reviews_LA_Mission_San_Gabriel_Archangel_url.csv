50,One of my favorite California Missions,"This mission is one of 22 built during the Spanish reign of California, and one of my favorites. Worthwhile to pay for a ticket to go through the gardens and original chapel .... Very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiY_13
40,More interesting than beautiful but still easy on the eye,"What remains of the mission's original buildings are mostly fragments located in a well laid out tract of land between two churches. Here the story of the mission from its founding to its expansion and appropriation by the Mexican state and on to the present, is laid out in well organized information plaques and exhibits that can be viewed in an orderly sequence. Visitors learn about the beginnings of California's wine industry and can touch the original vine stock which still grows in a courtyard. The well, cistern, ovens, candle and soap vats, tanneries, and other facilities are on display as well as a selection of cultivated vegetation like olive trees and a fascinating kapok tree. There is also a museum with religious and cultural relics including a silver baptismal font and ladle presented by one of the Spanish monarchs. I especially appreciated the maps that showed how water was brought from the surrounding hills and how the nearby land was divided into different uses. You may encounter knots of school kids on organized tours that are integrated into the state's history of California curriculum. The kids tend to outnumber all other visitors and they can be boisterous when ringing the bell and rushing about taking selfies but they were all good-natured and polite when we were there. You could easily spend a couple hours here and come away with a new appreciation for the role of missions in the development of the state. Plaudits to the preservationists who have kept this enterprise going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taughboyne
50,"If you love history and architecture, you must visit!","We (I brought my 1 year old) visited the mission while we were visiting Pasadena. It’s the 3rd one I’ve had the pleasure of exploring. It is peaceful, beautiful, and there is so much history on display .I’ve been to San Juan Capistrano and Mission San Fernando Rey de España. This one had a couple of surprises history wise that really delighted me. The Ramona grape vine was inspiring and a lovely reminder of the incredible history of this mission. The info about the orange trees originally planted there was cool too!This is a really great place to explore for an hour-hour and a half.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstockton
50,Well worth a visit!,"I was recently in San Gabriel on business, and I remembered there is a California mission here. I've seen maybe half a dozen other missions, and I've always enjoyed visiting them. This happened to be a Sunday morning, so there was an English-language service ongoing in the old church (there's a modern church on the property as well, across the gardens, which had a Spanish-language service at the same time - I believe the languages alternate through the day on Sundays).The old church is beautiful, as expected. Everything is in excellent condition. The gardens are very nice as well, with a number of exhibits explaining what mission life was like in its early days. The museum hadn't yet opened, so I can't speak to that.Give yourself 30-60 minutes and you can see the church and grounds. More time for the museum of course, but I don't know how extensive it is.Definitely 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmX7412QG

Program your GPS for the ""mission parking lot"" to save extra steps and confusion!The bookstore attendant was very helpful and we enjoyed walking the grounds and seeing how simply they lived hundreds of years ago.

50,Beautiful Mission close to Los Angeles!,"The 4th of 21 California Missions I visited on my motorcycle trip was Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. The Mission was founded on ""The Feast of the Birth of Mary,"" September 8, 1771. Chronologically it is the 4th Mission built of the 21. It is a small mission compared to the other ones I have visited but definitely worth a visit. It is near Pasadena and very close to Los Angeles. My Garmin was a block off and had me park at San Gabriel Mission Playhouse which in itself looks like a Mission! So if yours does the same thing just park and ask where the mission is. There is plenty of parking at the Mission and a nice gift shop too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimDore

I must confess that a field trip to the Mission San Gabriel at just nine years old change my life regarding my Catholic faith. I have done a great deal of soul searching lately and have come to the conclusion my faith in Catholicism has never been stronger in the last 60 years of my life. The Mission San Gabriel is the embodiment of images, words, beliefs, people, ideas, and religious ceremony of the Catholic faith. You must visit the great gift shop in the mission and say hi to Teresa Galeazzi the gift shop manager.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyswiftca
40,Wonderful Visit,"This was a perfect sized Mission for us to tour. There were a variety of items and lots of history to take in. The parking lot was being worked on so we grabbed a street 2 hour parking spot. We visited in the early morning and had no wait time to purchase our tickets. The gift shop had many items including candles to purchase if you wanted to light one in the church. I would not suggest bringing children here unless this type of history interests them. Those that we saw were bored and/or fussy. The gardens were being worked on and we learned about the oldest grapevine that was so very impressive. I wish we could have stayed for mass, but maybe next time we are in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR1350
30,Third Mission Visited,"This is the third mission I’ve visited after San Juan Capistrano and San Luis Rey, and so far this is my least favorite. There are some nice aspects about the mission like the Spanish/Moorish architectural elements of the church’s facade, the centuries old artwork and written records, however the service is less efficient because unlike the other missions I’ve been to, you have to get your ticket to the museum from the gift shop instead of its own booth, which makes the lines longer when people are inquiring about items they want to buy while I just want to get my ticket. Other people were confused about this too when I visited, so I thought I might add this point. The mission complex itself is also not as well preserved as there seemed to be random things lying around and the grounds are not as well tended to. Still, there is some good history here and it’s pretty amazing that this small complex is the namesake for the entire San Gabriel Valley that surrounds it. Probably wouldn’t come back personally, but at least I can mark another California mission off the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Beautiful Mission with nice gardens,"We visited the San Gabriel Mission after my wife finished reading a book about one of it's founding priests, Junípero Serra. It was very cool. It costs $6 to get in, but there is quite a bit to see. There is the mission itself, a small museum, and the grounds a full of gardens, cemetery plots, a nice fountain, artifacts and even the remains of their winery and candle/soap factory. Wish they had relics like some of the other missions. Those are super cool.The beauty of the many paintings and sculptures in the mission as well as the historical significants is enough to interest anyone out there. This would make a great day trip from LA, as it has as pretty cool town around it. Check out the Mission Theater, the many local historic restaurants, and even a few close other museums like the Ramon Parlor, a free museum just around the corner (though only open on Saturdays from noon-3).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage

40,"Beautiful Mission Church, But the Rest Looks a Little Run Down","San Gabriel was the 8th mission we have visited in California, and the Mission Church is quite beautiful, with many works of Spanish colonial art. The larger mission itself and courtyards seemed to be undergoing some renovations, so that it appeared somewhat dilapidated. Not like the magnificent Santa Ines in the Santa Ynez Valley whose interior courtyard is beautifully laid out. Interestingly this mission was taken over by the Capetian Fathers from the Franciscans about a century ago. There is plenty of free parking and be aware that when it's hot, it's really hot in that vicinity and aside from the church itself and the gift shop, there is very little shade in the interior courtyards, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestSideKid

Quite frankly we came here only because the Norton Simon Museum in nearby Pasadena turned out to be closed on Tuesdays, but it worked out well. You enter through a gift shop and walk through the various gardens and a small cemetery. There's a densely packed ""museum"" (a few rooms with loads of artifacts). The signage and map are informative.Be aware that there's a mission-styled theater a few blocks away. At first we thought that was the mission itself, but it's not. We parked on the street near there (2 hours free parking on weekdays) but could have driven a few more blocks, where we would have found that the San Gabriel Mission has a huge lot out front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerseyjazz

40,A beautiful historic Mission rich in Californian history.,"Founded in 1771, just 2 years after the discovery of the San Gabriel Valley, the Mission is rich in California history.I did not have much time at Mission San Gabriel Archangel as I arrived close to the time for last entry but I had long enough to walk the gardens / mission grounds and to appreciate the beauty of this historic church. The Mission is open Monday thru Saturday 9:00am to 4:30pm and Sundays 10:00am to 4:00pm. The entrance fee is US$6.00 for adults, US$3.00 for a youth and Free for children under 6 years old and Seniors (aged 62+) pay US$5.00 (Times and costs were correct as of July 2016 when I visited the Mission).The visitors information sheet and Mission complex map is excellent and certainly helps you get the most from your visit. As well as the beautiful altar in the church itself I really liked the path covered in grapevines (planted in 1925) that go from the entrance to the church towards the museum building. I also loved the Peace Garden with the colourful hand-made tile picture of 'Our Lady of Guadalupe'.This Mission is certainly worth an hour of your time - I recommend paying it a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69

50,Still on a Mission,"I've visited this site many times, but it had been a while. Mission San Gabriel was the fourth Mission founded in California and the first near what is now Los Angeles. Today the Mission is open and for a small fee, you take a self guided tour through gardens, past various utility buildings, , dying vats, and of course, the Chapel. I've been to all the Missions in California (and several in other states) and I believe this is the only one with models of all 21 California Missions, built as a WPA project during the depression. The Mission is also home to the oldest grape vine and in its day, it was supplier of wine to all the California Missions.On the day of my most recent visit, we had just left a birthday party for the City of Los Angeles. The celebration began with an eight mile walk from the Mission to El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Park, a walk that reenacted the walk from the Mission to found the city 235 years ago.If you are interested in history, the Missions of California were the beginning of European life in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

40,The fourth Spanish mission in California,"This mission was founded in 1771 and has zinfadel and muscat grape vines that are more than 200 years old (with trunks that could easily pass as trees rather than vines). The courtyard also includes an indigenous hut and sweat lodge, and the cemetery covers the remains of some 6000 native people (Tongvas) as well as marked graves of Franciscan missionaries.I found the air in the (somewhat air-conditioned) museum quite stagnant, though I was interested in the old books housed there.The church has interesting primitive or noeo-primitivist paintings of the stations of the cross (there is another set outdoors).The missions at Carmel and Santa Barbara (and, if I remember correctly, San Diego) are more imposing (and San Francisco's Mission Dolores has its ""Vertigo"" connections, but San Gabriel's is quite peaceful.

50,perhaps the most beautiful of all the missions,"in the heart of San Gabriel, you won't find a mission more central and more beautiful. After a multi-million restoration, the mission, the ground and the history make this mission come alive. A much better than average gift shop and peaceful places to pray add to experience.

The old mission church is beautiful, but more interesting to me were the remains of some of the mission industries: vats for tanning hides, vats for making soap and tallow, an aqueduct, and equipment for making wine. The mission museum is housed in buildings that were once a weaving room, a granary, and carpenter shops. Don't miss the Stations of the Cross painted by Native American artists.

40,"18th cent atmosphere, unique Cordobese architecture, Sunday Mx brunch, ethnic mis","Mostly oriented to the local Mexican community, while allowing some space and time for Vietnamese and Whites. The mission dates from 1771, thus predating the founding of the US, and has kept a unique atmosphere. It was one of the early foundations of F. Serra who tried his hardest to keep Spaniards (Catalonians mostly), Mexican creole (whites) & mestizos (mixed), Indians (the semi-nomad Tongva), and Blacks, sharing a land with minimum friction (i.e. the shaman woman Toypurina who led the Indian revolt against the Spaniards, was the mistress of the Spanish Captain Pedro Fagés). The Tongva-Gabrielino were not just evangelized but taught Spanish language and agricultural techniques and trades, while they also kept their own. They lived in their own huts, had their own lots of land to cultivate their own native foods, but also contributed to the building of the mission, to which they adapted some of their own traditions, motifs, colors, and even paintings (featured in the mesmerizing museum); the Padres also adopted Indian foods to the mission's diet: corn, beans, squash, nopales, flowers, as is featured in the most interesting gardens, which are the object of study of UC Davis. The 1st industry of California, grape/wine, was the direct product of this joined effort, and would soon provide wine to export to other parts of the US. Despite of the epidemic that, at first contact, killed many Indians, 90% of the Indians remained in the mission, as under the Padres they were not semi-enslaved (to toil for the Spaniards), or hunted down and killed as in other parts of the non-Catholic US (""The only good Indian is a dead Indian"", General Sherman, hero of the Civil War). The 21 missions kept in this manner, hundreds of thousands of Indians, who, as soon as they lacked the protection of the Franciscans, were kicked out and ""liberated"" of their lands, by the Mexicans, who then proceeded to force them to work as day-laborers in the cattle ranchs they ""created"" (took from the missions, just in San Gabriel, they ""liberated"" the 60,000 cattle the Padres and the Indians had taken care of for a century).President Lincoln later gave the missions back to the Catholic Church, as a way to congratiate himself with the Irish Catholic soldiers (recent immigrants) who gave their lives at Gettysburg for the US. The poet Longfellow was the 1st East-Coast Anglo to appreciate the missions, along with the author of the epochal novel ""Ramona"" (a San Gabriel mission ""Indian"") by the great Helen Hunt Jackson.The mission was built by a friar from Cordoba, city that is home to the great Mosque of the 10th century, pride of Europe, as it is unique. F. Antonio Cruzado, nostalgic for his Andalusian city, built this mission in a style that is different to all the other missions. He also baptized ""Antonio de las Rancherías [huts]"", the Indian who painted the 18th cent. Stations of the Cross featured in the Museum, 1st product of artistic hybridation of White & Indian.I attend an early weekly mass in order to avoid the Mexican mass packed with screaming children, and parents who neither walk out nor correct them. However, I do also attend the Mexican brunch under the vine: coffee, tacos, pan dulce, aguas frescas (""fresh waters"" of tamarind, hibiscus flower, watermelon, cucumber, and horchata [rice with cinnamon].The Mexican community contributes greatly to the warmth of the mission by sponsoring many events during the year, including the September ""fiesta"", attended by all ethnic groups, featuring all kinds of food from all over the world. The current Claretian priests, of all ethnic groups (black, Vietnamese, Indian, white, Mexican) enrich the masses and cater to all people, and try to keep the sermon non-ideological (except one priest), but with a strong message of Catholic care for the poor, which explains why all the ethnic groups are devoted to the needs of the San Gabriel community. If I attend Sunday mass, I sometimes attend the 3 pm Vietnamese mass, although I don't understand a word (I follow the readings from the missal in English and Spanish), because of the exquisite gentleness and beauty of the songs and the garments of the women.The mission is a cultural and historical experience. The old Anglo man who tour-guides in the Museum is very anti-Catholic anti-Franciscan and anti-mission... and the priests know it and have allowed him to say what he wants for all the years that I have been coming to the San Gabriel Mission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaM234

50,"The Most Prosperous, The Most Afflicted!","This was the fourth California Mission in the chain of 21, founded by Father Junipero Serra in 1771. It's present location is actually the third for this most prosperous of missions. While it was blessed by nature with fertile lands and a total of 27 rancheritas raising livestock, it's location was cursed by nature with frequent disasters. The mission was severely flooded in its very early years destroying virtually all of its crops for the year - and the mission was moved as a result to higher ground. A few years later there was a devastating earthquake, necessitating a move to its present location. Almost exactly ten years after the mission was founded, eleven families moved west into 'the valley of the 10,000 smokes' as it was called by the Native American population living there to found a new 'pueblo' soon known simply as Los Angeles. The church has a unique, largely cordovan-moorish design featuring round-top buttresses and long, narrow windows. Much of the interior features original artefacts, including the iconic painting 'Our Lady of Sorrows' which - when shown to the native Americans by FATHER Serra - immediately pacified them. The buildings are survuivors of many an earthquake, and there have men many 'earthquake refits' to strengthen them. The mission museum is open 9 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Saturday. Admission is $6 per adul and $3 per child. Masses: Saturday 5:30, Sunday: 7 and 9:30. Take I-10 to exit 24. Turn north onto New Road. New Road becomes Ramona. Continue on until you see a small park (Plaza Park) on your right. The mission will be on your right just past this park. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden

The six-belled campanario - one bell weight a ton andcan be heard up to 8 miles away. Also features the monastery with kitchen gardens, old books, parchments, working tools and a winery.

50,It's a great tour and well stocked gift shop,"We had toured this mission and kids, but just took our ten year old son on the tour. He really enjoyed it.

50,I was baptized here in 1941...,"Born and raised in San Gabriel, I know the history of this significant mission and Father Serra. I visit the mission every time I get 'home' to the area.

50,Where Los Angeles Began,"I love all the missions in California but this one is particularly fascinating. When I visit I cannot help but reflect on how this Mission once stood alone in what is now the center of such a vast urban area. It is a beautiful Mission and grounds with excellent artifacts in the museum. Even if not for the special connection to Los Angeles' history this would be a wonderful place to visit.On display are baptismal records hand written by FR Junipero Serra, several historic books and bibles and photos and paintings of significant people in the Mission and the areas history. Very much worth visiting for those who come to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bccrab
30,Good local history,Local history is represented here. A bigger gallery of old photos would help get a better 'feel' for the location. At least the church was able to raise the funds to retofit after the Whittier earthquake which was pretty hard on the old buildings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577brucec

50,I loved this enchanting place,"My son and I came here on a Wednesday morning and had the place to ourselves. I was enchanted. I am protestant, not Catholic, but I absolutely positively felt the presence of God here. I also could feel the deep sense of history the place had... don't know how to describe it... This place is loved and cherished by its caretakers, and has been for centuries, and you can feel that. The gardens were beautiful with trees and vines dating to the late 1700's! The small cemetery was so nicely kept and touching with the tributes to the fathers who have passed away here. The church itself is so quaint, so charming, that I could sit there in the stillness and quiet and feel my cares drift away. The museum was my favorite part. This is not a polished, professionally-curated museum. This is a lovingly preserved collection, probably low on funds to preserve things, with many hand-written tags rather than typed. There is an AMAZING collection of old bibles here [dating to the 1500's!], old furniture, old garments, paintings, photos, pottery, dioramas, etc., etc. The museum was chock full of wondrous and fascinating things. I am not exaggerating when I say that I saw more things here than at the Ellis Island museum in New York City, which has few objects on display and mainly had just pictures [at least as of July 2014]. I really wish I lived closer to this place... I could see myself going here often. Even my atheist son said he wished we lived closer so he could attend worship here! Mission San Gabriel, know that you are doing a wonderful job caring for your treasure. Please keep it up and know that you have an important task that does not go unnoticed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichiganMelissa04
50,"""Most Historically Interesting Mission in California""","Great choice for the ""Fourth Grade Mission Project"" and to simply learn about the history of one of the most interesting missions in this great state of California. Our family visited the mission on a special day when the original Indian tribe who lived and worked at the mission in the past came that day to talk about their ancestors life in the olden days.. This is a fascinating working mission which shows for example how soap, wine, and leather goods were made. They have a nice museum with interesting artifacts and even a photo of Lucille Ball when she visited this mission.I highly recommend a visit. Nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyr721

50,A hidden treasure in plain sight!,"I've driven by Mission San Gabriel years ago. I remember little of the place other than I wanted to continue driving. This time we stopped and went it.Wow! Though not along the main El Camino Real of the 21st century (US 101/I-5), it's worthwhile to detour to see it. The chapel is small and to its side is a neat baptistry. In the courtyard are the graves of its clergy. But the hidden treasure is hidden behind the sacristy.The museum is the gem of the place! Many relics and artifact and great old photos, artwork, furniture, santos and more! It's not just about Mission San Gabriel, its also about the community it started, grew around it and its people!If you like both mission history and the history since its founding in by Father Serra as the forth of California's Missions in 1771, by all means visit there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazo1894

There are displays of Spanish and Tongva Indian culture. There is a small cemetery inside the walls and many objects from the Mission's past are on display. Walls are painted with colorful murals.Hanging grapes were ripening on the arbors, the Chapel has a beautiful Retablo and the Museum is overflowing with Mission history and artifacts. Restored workshops and interpretive displays explain Mission life. Very nice gift shop. Nearby buildings reflect Mission Revival style. There are several nice cafes in the area.

50,visit the area around the mission as well,"We stopped off here on our way to Pasadena - if we can, we visit the Californian missions as we are interested in early Californian history.There isn't a lot of parking around the area but we found some on Mission Drive. As well as looking at the mission, we followed the historic walking tour that can be downloaded from the San Gabriel website www.sangabrielcity.com and which takes in the mission, Plaza park, and the Old Grapevine.There is a self guided tour of the mission and it's museum which is worth taking - $5 adults/$3 children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bear1953

30,Missions,"I've been visiting California missions over the last few years. (I'm an atheist, former Catholic.) My favorite by far is San Juan Capistrano. They call theirs a 'basilica'. I've seen the Basilica in Rome. Capistrano will give you a glimpse of the money, like the Vatican does. The other missions, like San Gabriel aren't nearly as special. I pay special attention to what population built the missions and how they were treated. Fascinating!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HedthreeG

The architecture is completely different on the outside, but inside, it is just beautiful, like most all the other missions in California. Talk with the ladies in the gift shop: they adore their mission and will spend time talking about it with you if they aren't swamped with customers. This little mission has received more than its fair share of damage from earthquakes, but it is always restored to its original beauty in fairly short time. Well worth a trip to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puttermutt17
50,Always fun to walk in the past.,"The Mission is just a wonderful, relaxing place to visit. Stroll through the gardens, sit by the fountain, take a walk through history in the cemetery.

30,Great historical site.,"The mission grounds include a more modern functioning Catholic church, but the old mission portion is definitely showing its age. It would be great if more effort could be put into restoration and preservation. Considering it has survived several very strong earthquakes, however, it's wonderful that it's still here. There is a small museum here as well. Great for a local 4th grader to visit as part of his/her California history studies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinkmommy

30,A Nice Day Trip,"My goal is to visit & photograph all of the California Missions....I was surprised when I arrived, because I really couldn't locate the entrance, because I parked on the side street and walked in. The other surprise was as I was standing in the front garden, which is really a graveyard for the priests who served at the mission, I suddenly remembered that I had visited the mission 40+ years ago when I was in 5th grade!What I liked: The graveyard garden was pretty and it led to an arbor & patio that was a lovely place to sit & meditate. The grounds were well kept up and evoked a sense of peacefulness. The building were in good repair and didn't look too new or refurbished.What I didn't like: All the gravestones of the priests had been replaced with nice new polished black granite/marble markers. That took away the sense of historical value for me. The second thing that I not only disliked but made me angry was in the middle are of the priests graveyard, to the left was a crappy wooden cross which stated ""Jose, the first Indian that died here."" What a blasted INSULT! They either need to show that man more respect or just remove the sign.In comparison to the other 10-11 Missions I have visited, this is not the best nor is it the worst.... As it is located in the middle of suburbia, it is not the easiest to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntie-Nanuuq

I was born and raised in Miami, Florida and educated on the Eastern Seaboard. However, I love, love, love the California missions and visit them every time I'm in the state. The San Gabriel Mission has in-tact artifacts from the time of the mission, as well as an interesting historical record of what the mission has ""meant"" over the years. I learned a lot about the history of California wine production from this mission! The buildings, grounds, and ""museum"" are well-kept and clean. The staff is enormously helpful and some are very knowledgeable. If you want to get a sense of where this place called California came from, don't miss the missions.
