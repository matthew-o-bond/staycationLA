50,Good beer and you can bring outside food!,"I enjoyed the visit. Very interesting place. They only sell Beer, and it is all made in house. You can buy beer which they can in front of you. If you want food you are welcome to bring outside food! When I was there one group had a birthday party, another a baby shower, some guys brought pizza and some others Chinese.I highly recommend this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob-CS

50,Well crafted beer in an nice Brewpub atmosphere,"Reportedly, this venue is Arcadiaâ€™s first microbrewery which opened up in 2015. In addition to the personable beertenders and inviting atmosphere, I very much enjoyed the uniqueness and quality of the beer offered. The evening I was there, there were a lot of Stouts and Porters on tap, with recipes and styles not typically seen. Of course many other styles were also available. I ended up ordering a flight of dark beers. I always appreciate brewers who try new variations. Parking is on the street; however, for travelers staying in Arcadia, the brewery is a very short walk from five hotels located nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keystone_Traveler
