30,"Takes <10 minutes, unless you include 'American Tropical', which is essentially integral","Remant of the Sepulvada block, with 2-3 recreated interior spaces. Something of a diorama, bu worth a few minutes time - free. American Tropical, integrated with the exhibit is Mexican muralist Sequeiros' contribution and political statement on the roots of LA's modern (1930's) success. The curators there are educated, engaging if engaged, and the original mural itself (what's left) can be viewed in addition to giant sized scale recreation. Worth contemplating as art and also history. (There is an undeniable kinship to Rivera here - though of course by the time of his Coit Tower work, for example, Rivera had softened his social commentary considerably.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
30,Little gem of local history,"Senora Francisca Gallardo owned a house lot between Bath Street and Vine Street (later renamed Olvera Street) where she built an adobe – this was Sepulveda House. She gave this adobe to her niece Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda in 1881.Eloisa refashioned this adobe – the brick facade on Main Street was painted reddish brown and outlined with white paint to create the illusion of lines of mortar between the bricks.A large building with twenty two rooms, Sepulveda House had two large ground floor store fronts on Main Street. For boarders, it had fourteen bedrooms and a bathroom on the higher floor. Senora Sepulveda’s private quarters on the ground floor were separated from the stores by an aisleway.In 1901, she gifted the building to her niece and goddaughter Eloisa Martinez de Gibbs who was married to City Councilman Edward Gibbs.After Senora Sepulveda’s death in 1903, the Gibbs family also moved out two years later. However, they continued to own the building until it was taken over by the State of California in 1953.In the 1940s, a USO canteen was located in Sepulveda House that served thousands of troops passing through Union Station.One can see a recreated Senora Sepulveda’s kitchen as also her sleeping quarters. It is a little gem of local history with photographs and old objects on display – makes for a nice fifteen-minute break from the hustle and bustle of Olvera Street.Admission is free - The Sepulveda Block Museum is open Tuesday through Sunday between 10am and 3pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
