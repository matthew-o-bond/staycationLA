50,Hidden gem,"Nice place with surprisingly good wines. They are a young winery. Their estate grown tempranillo is very nice. Not as heavy as I'm used to, and I think that made it much more interesting. The chardonnay was also delicious. Our faves for the day were the pinot noir and the syrah. They have a few more on the list we'd love to try, so we'll have to call ahead to see what's on the tasting. Found them on groupon. They are off the beaten path for sure, so when trying to follow google, be sure to be looking for their building. Signage could be bigger, too. The folks are kind and cheerful and they make you feel welcomed. Sometimes they have live music and sometimes karaoke. They also have a tray of cheese, crackers, and salami available. We saw a couple bring in dogs as well. Overall a hidden gem in the desert and if like wine, recommend you check it out. I did call ahead and was told we could bring our own food.",IrishHazelEyes

Smooth.All of the reds were uh-mazing and the people, the wonderful people, well that was the icing of a very memorable experience.Highly recommend.Thank you for a great time!",SilverLake2TheWorld
