50,See the Center of the Universe!,"Absolutely amazing place filled with electronics and very happy people! Next Mars lauch in 2020..Everyone who works there has see the movie ""The Martian"" 10 times! This is a MUST see to put on your bucket list!",Kathleen B
20,Disapointed,"There is too much time spent showing an intro video. Someone on a JPL tour is already a space enthusiast; we all know about the planets. Make the video shorter and focus on JPL. The guides rushed us in and out of each area and did not allow enough time to take pictures. They should spend less time telling cute stories and more time letting people take pictures. Ask tour participants in front to trade with those in back, so everyone gets time to take pictures with Mission Control, The Vehicle Assembly, etc behind them. Most of my tour was looking at the back of people's heads.",Jared W
40,Fun Experience,Fun place to visit! JPL open once a year and we always go there to explore new space technologies. It can easily spend a whole day in there.,KUNOUS
50,Thrilling experience,"We were able to visit JPL last summer when they held an open house. It was exciting to see the room where so many space adventures were guided. We were able to see the ""clean room"" and a model of a Mars lander.",Toni S
50,Great place to tour,If you have interest in space you need to tour here. Very informative with an excellent guide Takes about two hours with lots of steps but so worth it,Jeff B
50,Great Day during the annual JPL Open House,"The JPL Open House is great for adults and kids alike. Lot's of things to see, activities, and food trucks. Additionally, the volunteers that work at JPL and share some of the work they are doing with the public are AWESOME. Can't wait to come back again and again.",celdenbu
50,Event in JPL,"I had very nice experience attending event in JPL (NASA), very nice people and scientists and guest and academics. One of museums of NASA is just there and you can see lot's of historical artifacts of space exploration.",Edgar K
50,Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"If you know at least nine months in advance that you are travelling to Pasadena, CA, (JPL) is a place that you should visit. You can apply for a tour but the slots fill up really fast. Go to the JPL website to find out when and how to register for future tours that may align with your vacation plans. This tour is good for everyone meaning solo, family and friends. There is a lot of walking involved but I beleive there is an area to indicate if special access is needed.",daudreyo
50,"Unique, and informative","This is a truly unique place to visit. With part history, part knowledge and of course many parts of coolness, there is much to learn and see here.If you have any curiosity of space, this will quench that curiosity and then some. I am certain you will come away with having learned about matters you were unaware of also. Sadly i can not simply explain this location, other then if you can do a tour here do so.",Batdog62
50,Space History in the making,"Lots of walking to see the most interesting story of the next trip to Mars. Construction, testing, history of space travel all on one site. Make plans early.",Pauline K
30,Hard to compare JPL with anything else since there is nothing like it,"JPL open house was such a success with its long lines to get in, lack of parking and overcrowding that they now provide public tours outside of the open house event. The only draw back is the lack of informative public outreach tents and kid fun robotic demonstrations, but in the small guided tours you do get to see some of the interesting static models and a couple of assembly rooms now being used for storage with large wall banners of JPL past programs line the walls. The tour ends in the main display at visitor hall where you start the tour, but there is no place to buy JPL logo gifts. Remember to visit the JPL website to make your reservations, they do fill up several months in advance. The tour involves a lot of walking and is not wheelchair accessible nor recommended for those who use a walking cane. Walking involves going up hill and the use of stairs, so wear comfortable shoes.",Donald F
50,Excellent place for knowledge enhancement,"A must place to visit,for all astronomy enthusiasts when you are around Los Angeles. But a very advanced planning is required. It’s better to arrive at the venue well in advance,since the parking is limited for visitors!",Enappen
50,Amazing Tour of Cutting Edge Science,"We received a guided tour of JPL from a friend who works there, and it was amazing. We saw the Mission Control Room, as well as the clean room where they are assembling the next spacecraft bound for Mars in 2020. JPL must have more PhD's per square mile than any place on Earth. We were most impressed by the knowledge and dedication of the talented people who work there. You have to know someone at JPL to get a tour.",RebelVirginia
50,A must see,"Extremely interesting tour of the facilities & presentation about the history & future of space exploration.So glad we were able to reserve a spot on the free tour.They open up a tour date months & months in advance & it fills up instantly! As soon as you know when you are going to be in the area, jump on their site & see if there is a tour available.We can’t wait to go again!",nellatenaj
40,Just for a visit and took pictures,Just went there for a visit but didn’t do tour because needing to book something or else to go inside but I was there just for visit. finding parking wasn’t easy.To see all the NASA has to offer that’s it till next time the tour.,HidalgoKlein
50,Fun learning experience,"Parking is terrible at JPL, but the tours are worth the pain. The museum and static displays are great for all ages. Getting to see the landers and satellites in person gives a much better scale of size than what you see on television or in a book. The open house events are worth going to see the special displays they set up just for the event.",timg742
20,Waist of time.,"When you book a tour and see hoe fast sits are gone you have the impression that this is a must see and hope you are going on a life changing event. Reality is completely different. They show you a home made quality movie, some scale down models of old crafts and an empty assembly building. I came out very disappointed.",David P
50,Tour of a lifetime!,"Fantastic experience touring NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory with my son who was doing an internship. For those without inside connections, one can book a public tour but beware these spots fill up quickly and should be requested months in advance.I'd recommend first heading to the von Karman vistior's center to get the lay of the land. You can only enter with a tour after having gained access to the campus and will be shown a film about JPL's part in space exploration. They have a neat exhibit next door to help cement your knowledge about the missions and technology surrounding them.We were able to see them working on Mars 2020 rover from the viewing gallery in their bunny suits as well as the outdoor recreation of the surface of Mars where they do testing on the rover. We were in luck when we visited Mission Control as the head of the team allowed us into the room after we viewed it from the viewing gallery. We were able to stand at the ""Center of the Universe"" as well as partake in some of NASA's lucky peanuts!!!!!My husband, an engineer, said that JPL is like Disney for scientists. Not only did we get to see all the cool exhibits, there were also little pop-up surprises when we least expected them. Walking down the side walk we saw two young grad students working in what looked like a sand box under a tent--they were testing rover prototype wheels to see if they would get stuck in rocks under that sand. We also saw them unloading a base for one of the shuttles in a parking lot! We ate in the cafeteria and the food was fantastic--have to keep all those great minds well fed!I highly recommend JPL tour. My one tip is that if you want to purchase any souvenirs you buy them once inside the campus. There is a very small gift shop at the entrance but the selection is not nearly as good.",sazoram
50,Amazing!,"Impressive history, phenomenal scientific and engineering feats. Inspiring personnel and facilities. Highly recommend!",Alyssa D
50,Go JPL,It’s a great tour. Other reviews cover all the details. If you love space exploration then this is for you. Get online and follow directions. It took us a few tries to secure spots on a tour and they’re booked months ahead but it’s well worth the planning! Get there early enough to for parking spot. Go!,pekotime
50,Fascinating Exhibits and Lectures,From time to time JPL scientists provide lectures for free about their work. The Von Karman series is excellent - generally every other month on Thursday evenings. The mueseum section is outstanding. Want to see a life size replica of one of their Space Missions? Go!,Katrina1222
50,Massive Scientific Facility,JPL has been involved in the development of our space technology. The campus is massive with over 30 buildings. You see some of the actual space modules. The tour is very insightful and is an excellent tour for all ages. Note - you need to walk to the different buildings so it does get tiring.,DMUH
50,Space Out!,"One the to-go places in the world, let alone California. Can't miss this. Unless you can't stand science!",Salvatore F
50,Must be on the bucket list of any Space Hound,"All of the United States' robotic space exploration funnels through JPL. The spacecraft are conceived of, designed, and assembled here. The mission control teams are all here. The Deep Space Network of radio dishes in the US, Spain, and Australia are all controlled from here. You'll learn all of that and more in the 2.5-hour tour. However, it's a tough ticket to get. Blocks of reservations open on a certain day months in advance and they go quickly. There aren't that many tours, so grab a slot by signing up and then design a trip around that date. You'll be glad you did. Pro tip: Parking's at a premium in the JPL lots so arrive early. This is a busy, working facility.",Steven L
50,Register Ahead Online to Get Security Clearance,Great place to tour inside and out. The gardens around the area are lovely with roaig deer. FUn tour.,Jane S
40,The best use of our tax dollars!,"JPL runs NASA's outer planets and Earth observation programs, in addition to many technology and robotic projects. The work they do is amazing, and the scientific return is overwhelming compared with the human space program. You be amazed if you visit.NOTE CAREFULLY: They now have a one-day (no longer two day) open house on a spring weekend because it got too congested in the past. The date isn't set yet; keep checking their website (best to search on ""JPL 2018 open house""). When the date is set, they will say when (free) tickets can be ordered online. When the box office opens, get on immediately as they ""sell"" out in a few hours.If you have a group that wants to tour, call them and ask for the public relations office and they might be able to help at some other time of the year.",RGGBeatty
50,Exceptional,"Public tour just perfect. The guide was so well informed and made it both easy and interesting. If you have the time this is a must but reservations need to made months in advance. See it all from the control rooms for the rocket shots to satellites and the assembly building, a museum and more. This is a premier center for NASA and the quality of the presentation and the information was exceptional. Do not miss.",6sandy6
50,Must Do Tour,As others have said this is great insight into space exploration and anyone with the slightest interest should make the effort. The tour presents a brief history of JPL's role in space exploration and includes visits to the Vehicle Assembly Building and Mission Control (or Geek central as our guide suggested). The tour is suitable for all ages and our guide Brian was a great communicator who showed real passion for the work of JPL.,Peter W
50,More than being a nice museum,"I joined the ~2hr public tour, which needed reservation well in advance. This site is a 'must-go' if you are interested in space exploration. While some of the exhibit displays look like a museum (they all looked stunning, btw), this place is where research and building of space robotics actually happened. When they took us to the giant cleanroom where they are building Mars 2020 spacecraft and landing vehicle, we were witnessing significant history! The tour guides spoke very well and were able to communicate effectively with diverse audience. And it is all free. Well worth the visit!Plenty of walking from building to building. So wear comfortable footware.",Albert L
50,Nasa,Always worth taking a tour of this place. It has lots of history and lots of things to look at. If your a space buff definitely worth a trip.,pasadena4life
50,I'm a nerd so I was bound to like this place,"Few things were cooler to me then starting the tour in a room full of reproductions space probes. Is there something wrong with me that I get excited to see the famous golden record Carl Sagan compiled as a message to alien life on the side of a Voyager 1 scale model? My mind says ""Calm down, dude. It's a model"", but my heart says ""Hells yes! This is what America needs to be doing. Making mixtapes for aliens"". Even as a 44 year old, the interest I had as a young boy for the work NASA does hasn't waned. If I had my way this country would put most of its budget into space exploration because #1) It's awesome, and #2) There are few things more worthy our time IMHO. If you think so too this tour is for you.Be aware that this is a tour of a working facility, so there isn't a lot of hands on activities or touristy diversions. Think of it more like visiting your friends very interesting workplace at a fairly steady clip. This is a fairly in-demand tour, so you need to make reservations months in advance and when you get there it goes by pretty fast. In addition to seeing a lot of reproductions of space probes and the like you get a behind the scenes look at mission control and where our space exploration vehicles are built. Silicon Valley nerds have nothing on these folks. These brilliant men and women are digging into the soil of other planets in a search for alien life, building machines to move asteroids and dance through the rings of Saturn, exploring deep space, interstellar space, and bringing us answers to the secrets of the universe. It will always be a mystery to me why America doesn't fund this program far, far more than it does, but it's damn near miraculous what NASA/JPL is manages to do with what little it has. This tour will show you a small slice of that and remind you that Americans, despite our petty politics and narcissistic preoccupations, are still capable of doing great things when we're willing to invest our tax dollars into it.",Jason H
50,A Must See for old and young alike (and together),"I have attended a couple of the Open House events over the past 6 years and I am simply amazed at how many people show up to learn about the facility and their involvement in the Space Program.The effort and attention paid by the staff to encourage children is wonderful. My young son stood in the long lines on a very hot day like everyone else because he didn't want to miss out on any of the exhibits available to children.It is understandable for the benefit of the staff and the work process on projects being that the facility can't be open on a daily or weekend basis, however, if at all possible perhaps adding a second 'Open House' event 6 months opposite might allow more people to experience the Facility and learn about the incredible work that goes on there, right in our own back yard.",PAC626
50,From Earth to Mars in our backyard,Great visit. Our guide was superb. If fact all the staff at JPL was more than cordial. Made for a wonderful afternoon,RPVWilly
50,Tour JPL,This was cool. I went as a b-day present. We spent the nite in Pasadena because we didn't want to hassle with L A traffic commute. You come out OF THE TOUR understanding the different NASA specialty locations and this one is for building robots and not rockets like I always thought when thinking of NASA. You need to make reservations ahead and parking is a little tough so go early. You get to see them assembling Mars Rover.,Bridget B
50,Any interest in space exploration? Gotta come here!,"This is something I've wanted to do for years. Almost everything you read or hear about in terms of our space exploration program happens here. It has a marvelous history (which the tour doesn't emphasize as much as it should), and its current programs are totally fascinating! The visit is keyed to people who aren't very familiar with some of the basic problems encountered in space, and does a great job of explaining how this is a wholly different proposition from what our early terrestrial explorers encountered. A lot of the tour is centered on forthcoming programs, including the next Mars exploration. The tour guides are outgoing and friendly and welcome questions. The facility is huge, requires a lot of walking and stair climbing, but worth it for sure. Came away wholly satisfied with the investment that we're making in the programs here.",DonaldYokum
50,All our work with robotics off planet,They are open to the public once in May. Sign up online early as all available spaces are rapidly filled. Great for the entire family. Meet and talk to the actual people working on the various projects.,stephencK6534IO
50,Great Tour,"We booked months ago...and went with friends. It was very informative and exciting. Parking was a bit of a challenge. Come a bit early, or you'll have to catch up with the tour in progress. Since the JPL is funded by NASA, who knows what might happen to its ongoing projects in the future. If you wanna see it, I wouldn't wait.",agraves26
50,2-hour dash through some interesting rooms,"Promised 2,5-hour walking tour around the facility was spent first 20 minutes checking in the late-arriving guests. Then a dash to watch a film, a visit to the clean room viewing terrace, a dash to see either two short films OR study the exhibits in the museum room. Then some other rooms. Then taken back to the reception/shop 10 minutes early. No entry back to the museum.",NewExperience2014
50,So interesting!,"Went to the open house today and had a blast! We had tickets for entry at 9am and I'm so glad we went early! Beat alot of the crowds and the heat! It was super hot by the time we left there. Everyone was really helpful and excited to educate people, I loved that. They answered any questions and were very knowledgeable about what they do. I'd go back every day if I could just to learn more. Be forewarned the campus is HUGE and the exhibits are spread across a big area up and down hills and stairs. My mom has a bad knee and she had a hard time with all the hills. Plenty of places to sit, and tables in the shade to eat your food from one of the options available. Tacos, hot dogs, sausages, shave ice, lemonade, burgers etc. Parking and traffic were a breeze...and free! So next year, go! Get early tickets and beat the heat!",cheryl l
40,A great look into America's space exploration,"I think not enough people in Southern California know about this tour, but schools certainly do. The tour itself is fantastic and the JPL staff do a really good job explaining the history and the current activities of JPL. As many have pointed out, you have to book in advance, but the tour and parking are free. Speaking of parking, it is a disaster, if you just show up 5 minutes before start of the tour. It can be frustrating and we almost did not make it because we could not find a parking spot. GET THERE EARLY. The advertised long walks and stairs is really not bad at all. Nothing even close to how much you have to walk at the airport to catch your gate. There are also ramps and elevators to bypass stairs, but make sure to tell the group leader that you want to do that. They don't like it if you just jump in an elevator on your own. Most of the tour is either sitting or standing, though. If you get stuck with large school groups, then you can imaging that the experience is a little ruined. The control room and the clean room are very cool. It is tough to take pictures while posing with signs or objects as everyone in the group wants to do the same, and the tour has to keep moving. The gift shop is really tiny, and has only a handful of stuff considered cool. You can get cheaper NASA shirts elsewhere for example. The tour ends promptly in 2 1/2 hours and they do a good job not letting you loiter around the campus. My 3 year old had a great time pointing out the planets that she has been learning about. Overall, a great experience, but it depends on what you expect before you go in.",mohsenmd
40,One of NASA's top three facilities along with Cape Canaveral and Houston Mission Control.,"You must register on-line and make a reservation way in advance, but it's well worth it.You can spend two and a half or nearly three hours learning the history of JPL, which is probably overdue for a more descriptive name change, view the super clean assembly facilities and the mission control center for all un-manned (robotic) interplanetary flights (Houston Mission Control only handles space flights with humans aboard).Guests can only visit as part of a group guided tour, which does not spend enough time in the ""museum"" exhibition showing the history of the major space exploration campaigns targeted at different solar planets. Allow plenty of time to find a parking spot. The parking lot goes on for miles as it attempts to accommodate more than 5000 JPL workers and daily visitors.",mongoose1950
40,Visited on Annual Open House Week-end,"This is a fabulous event. So many JPP people to explain and demonstrate all that makes NASA work. The only problem is, there are just too many people. When an event is only held for two days a year, it is very crowded. We would have liked to have spent more time here and seen much more.",travelG5
50,Open House at JPL,"We attended the annual open house at JPL and were entranced by all of the offerings. It is a great experience, very well organized, and very informative. It is crowded, but worth it. You need to make reservations to go, so plan ahead.",JamesBondLosAngeles
40,Well worth a visit,"If you live in the area or visiting Southern California, this place is well worth the visit. Having said that, there is nothing that will absolutely blow you away. What you see is very interesting and especially if you are scientifically minded. You can also see the displays where they keep track of spacecraft some of which were launched more than 40 years ago. The tour itself is informative. But this is not a non-stop thrill ride and you need to keep your expectations in check.",vincemc
50,The Center of the Universe,"Totally cool behind the scenes look at what the JPL does for NASA. A day after their open house, I was able to see things the public can't. Check out their next open house! Cool stuff.",Dhavekost
50,Where The Future Begins,"JPL is the place where all space missions are born. From robotics to satellites, from reentry chutes to deep-sea imaging, JPL's design engineers have conceptualized and executed everything from the first Earth orbit to the Voyagers. The open house is neat, but tickets go quickly (no charge for admission).",ScottWhitfield
20,Not what we hoped for.,"Went to the open house today and we were super disappointed. First off it's not a tour, it's basically walking into a crowd of 10 thousand people with a map and you're on your own. They say online that they won't let you in before your set time and will take 2 1/2 hours total which is comical! They let us in 45 minutes before our set time and it was pretty much a free for all. Be prepared to stand in the hot sun in line for an hour and a half for each exhibit, and then when you finally FINALLY get to see what you have been waiting for, like mission control, there are two men on computers and the room is...dead. Nothing really to see and 5 minutes to see it. Same for the other exhibits. Very quiet exhibits with not a lot going on. We really wanted to enjoy it, and see the scientists and engineers doing there thing but it was incredibly boring since everything they were working on were in the beginning stages and the people that work there weren't in the exhibits but doing crowd control or doing a quick hello and a 5 minute video. We were burned out after three exhibits and left. I would maybe go on the tours that are monthly with less people since the open houses seem like Disneyland with no ride!",Thedobsonfamily
50,Pretty neat place,The center of the universe! This place has some pretty interesting things going on here. Not open to the public except on explore JPL days...,Steve O
50,Great lectures,JPL offers free lectures that are open to the public on walk-ins. Presenters are literally world-renowned scientists.,HappyGeekyWoman
50,Excellent Overall,Excellent Overall! Must do! Visit Gift Shop ...even if is the small one at the front gate entrance. You can buy gifts for your friends and families that you cannot buy elsewhere. The Curiosity items are best.,HawaiiTraveler777
50,Excellent - just go...,Not a spacey person really... but the history appealed to me so wanted a look around. Fantastic accessible tour guide made it interesting and understandable (his name was Brian) and the stuff you get to see will blow your socks off!,Emerson_Powell
50,Great tour,It takes some time and logistics to get a reservation to visit JPL but I have to say that the tour was worth it. The visitors museum and multimedia experience was great. Seeing scale models of many of their probes was inspiring considering the size. You get to visit mission control for the probes as well as see one of the engineering areas where they work on future programs. Tour is 2.5 hrs long and can cater for mobility impaired people.,Herman R
50,Heaven for Space Lovers!,"Open once a year to the public is one of the most advanced space research centers in the world. Operated by the California Institute of Technology for NASA, it presides over operations such as the Planetary Robotic spacecraft as well as the construction and launching of Mars Rovers, Orbiting Satelites and responsible for NASA's Deep Space Network. A must visit for those who love space and aeronautics.",dmasu2005
50,So interesting!,I concur with previous reviewers about the JPL tour. Brian and Sara were our guides - so much fun and so knowledgeable. My only added suggestion would be to get there as early as possible. Parking is extremely limited. You can always hang out in the visitors centre or outside on the deck. I wish I had read up on JPL more before visiting as the tour is fairly fast paced and it can be information overload. Loved it though.,Laurel M
50,Excellent tour on Visitor Day,"I booked the February 6, 2017 Monday 1-3:30pm tour in September 2016. We arrived at 12:50pm. The Visitor parking lot was full so we parked on the street. The check in line was outside the Visitor Center where there is a bathroom and the Gift Shop. The first stop was a talk by the tour guide and a video in a room with some amazing replicas of current and past spacecraft (von Karman Visitor Center). There is a visit to Mission Control aka Space Flight Operations as well as the the Spacecraft Assembly Facility. The walking is conducted between buildings with some stairs interpersed. All in all a very interesting tour. My six year old thought the best part of the tour was the Gift Shop with the magnets and keychains.",satilano
50,Out of this world-in every sense!,"If you would like to see where your taxpayer dollars are spent in a great way, if you are a science geek, if you want your kids to appreciate science, if you want a better understanding of space, if you want to have a great day-take this tour. If you have a hard time walking, if you can't negotiate a lot of stairs, think twice.",transplanted2016
40,Interesting Tour,"The tour guide was very enthusiastic and covered quite a bit of information. I would have preferred to have a bit more time to view some of the exhibits since the exhibits had things concerning the space program that I would not be able to see anywhere else. There was only a slight scheduling snafu which seemed to annoy our tour guide who clearly wanted everything to go well for the group. There is a lot of walking and steps, but the guides offered elevators to those who needed them. The amount of walking makes the tour a bit longer than I would have liked, considering the number of exhibits we see, but considering this is a working facility not really anything one can do about it. If one is a space enthusiast or even if you are interested in learning more about the history of the space program, you should take this tour.",Mark
50,Winning the lottery,"We scheduled a trip to LA around successfully getting tickets to attend JPL's annual open house event, and it did not disappoint. If you are a space geek, this is a great event because you get behind the scenes access in nearly all of the buildings and get to speak with the actual scientists and student researchers. Tickets go fast, so monitor the web site to see when they are going to be available and don't wait too long. We obtained our tickets within the first hour they became available, and they were sold out within a couple of days.",kazkey
40,Nerd heaven!,"Having grown up through the 60's and 70's I was familiar with the JPL so when I found out tours are available I jumped at the chance to visit.The tour takes in mission control, assembly building and the museum. The guide is very knowledgeable and questions encouraged.It's a city or campus depending on your view and 6000 people work here. Security is strict but not over bearing.Parking is limited and beware that the souvenir shop closes before the tour ends.",Phil S
50,Space Adventure,If you like all things in outer space this is the place to learn and explore what we are doing in the sky above our heads. They offer tours where you can learn about past missions and see whats going on for our future. Take the time one afternoon and stimulate your mind with some way out future stuff.,darrylwayneb
50,Scientific!,"I you are interested in the space program, this place is for you. It is the place where numerous NASA space vehicles have been designed and built, including the Mars rovers. If you want to visit, they only accept outsiders once a week, and you have to reserve your visit on their website weeks in advance. Once accepted, you will be treated to a free guided tour well worth the visit.",Mary Jane D
50,Brain overload and absolutely wonderful tour!!!!,"This morning I took a DayTripper bus load to of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at CalTech in the La Cañada Flintridge area near Pasadena, CA.They call the tour “a journey of discovery” and it truly is because we were able to get an inside look at current space exploration activities on a 2½-hour walking tour of the facility.The tour started at the JPL Founder Professor Herbert von Kármán Visitor Center with a multimedia presentation entitled “Journey to the Planets and Beyond” providing us an overview of the Laboratory’s activities and accomplishments in the von Kármán Auditorium. There on either side of us were models of many of the spacecraft currently up/out there somewhere. In an adjacent room we visited the museum again with more models of various spacecraft and instruments, plus a camera that showed us some infrared images of ourselves and another short film.From there we went to the Space Flight Operations Facility, it sort of looked like mission control. Well it was actually, for missions of the JPL. They explained how JPL differs from the other Space Centers such as Houston, Cape Canaveral, etc.. With no current missions other than those being monitored, we were able to sit right where the staff sits at their consoles and see into the room where they communicates and track multiple spacecraft within the solar system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.NASA’s Deep Space Network sites enable continuous radio communication between several spacecraft and Earth. They are at the Goldstone complex located on the U.S. Army's Fort Irwin Military Reservation, northeast of Barstow, California; at Robledo de Chavela west of Madrid, Spain; and a third near the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve southwest of Canberra, Australia. All incoming and outgoing communications were lighting up the walls.Finally we got to go into an observation area of the Spacecraft Assembly Facility where we were high up looking down into the clean room where many past spacecraft/instruments have been assembled and the upcoming Mars 2020 rover will be assembled. It will be launched to investigate a region of Mars where the environment may have been favorable for microbial life and probe for evidence of past life.Since JPL is a working space exploration facility, highlights of the tour are subject to change with each visit. Don’t miss this fascinating look at robotic exploration of our Solar System.",mrevent
50,Behind the scenes at Nasa Jet Lab,Brilliant 2+ hour tour of the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab at Pasadena. Chance to see behind the scenes in their clean labs where the rockets are made and visit the launch control room. Tour guides really knowledgeable and no need to swot up on your physics before you go - they never make you feel stupid. A hidden gem and should be on everyone's LA agenda.,Diana B
50,Excellent Business Team Tour,"I participated in a tour of JPL recently as a member of our business team. The relevance of the JPL team efforts were clearly understood by our team. The profound impact was evident in our debriefing that occurred the following week.Whether a family or a business outing, there is profound impact to be realized in debriefing the experience subsequent to the visit.",JoshPhD
50,SO SO COOL!,"We, a nerdy family of four with 12- and 14-year-old children, all loved the JPL tour. It was really so much more interesting and entertaining than I expected. The tour guides were great and there were a number of exhibits that were very well designed for visitors. If you have any interest in space exploration, and are old enough to appreciate the complexity of the work done at JPL (there was a toddler on our tour who definitely was not!) you should take this tour.",Liz O
50,Free Public Tour!!!!,"They offer tours throughout the year on Mondays and Wednesdays. You just have to book them months in advance. I booked our tour for August in March. The tours fill up fast so as soon as they open the spots book them!The tour is amazing. After driving through security you will park and walk into the visitor center. Here is a little store for you to buy all the JPL gear you want!You will walk about a mile and go up and down a few lights of stairs, but they can accommodate a wheelchair!You start off with a short film about JPL, what they do and the universe! Try not to sit to close to the front or to close to the back. Then depending on your tour size they will split up into small groups.What you will see on the tour:A small museum with some to scale models of different rovers and satellites out in the galaxy.Mission Control: where all the deep space communications are coming to and going from.A large Clean Room: depending on when you go you may or may not see them working on something. This time around there were no active projects going on. But a few years ago they were working on the robot that is now heading to Jupiter!And then you will walk around JPL.If you want to see more of JPL then go to the Open House! This is another free event open to the public. There is a lot more going on and there are a lot more buildings you can go into. There are long lines to get into Mission Control and the Clean Room viewing areas. But if you have done the tour you have already seen them and can see the rest of JPL!If you are even remotely interested in space or robotics take the tour! You will not be disappointed.",Monkebones
50,the Annual Open House was fantastic,"This review is for the JPL Open House that was held June 4-5, 2016On Saturday, I remembered someone posted the JPL information on Facebook. I check out the Eventbrite site, and there were still 50+ tickets available, so I selected the 11:30 slot on Sunday. The tickets are free, but you need to get your tickets online before going to the event.The event was fairly organized, even down to the parking (which was free). When you approached the entrance, the staff checked your bag like they do at any sporting or theme park event. Strollers and Wheel chairs were allowed.As you walked through the gate, the JPL staff handed you a reusable black JPL tote bag and a map. I thought the JPL Open House was a guided tour where they lead you on a 2 hour walk, sort of like they do on a university campus. Not the case! It was like going to any convention or fan fest, where you decide where you want to go. Pair it up with the ""Explore JPL"" web app, and you can figure out which attractions had the shortest line.The lines were actually shorter than posted. One line was supposed to be 60 minutes, but when I clocked it, it was only 29 minutes.Highlights of my visit include:- Space flight operations facility. This is where Mission Control is at, and we've seen this on TV. At the end of the tour you get the ""I've been to the center of the universe"" sticker.- The view of the clean room at the Spacecraft Assembly Facility Highbay.1. That's where they finalized Juno before launching it to Jupiter.- Getting an infrared photo of us, using MDL's QWIP camera- And taking a break with Bill Nye, the Science Guy's video ""Why With Nye"".The event was over at 4:00, and I would say we completed about 70% of the event. I didn't know that there was so much to see and do. There was not a shortage of food or drinks, and as they hired plenty of vendors to serve up a variety of food, including the tantalizing Kettle Corn.Thumbs up!! I would recommend arriving early (I think the first appointment is 8:30 am?) and see as much as you can. It's not JUST for the nerds or science enthusiasts. Even a liberal arts person like me got a lot out of it, and had a great time learning.",callmemochelle
50,Don't Miss JPL!,"If you love anything to do with the space program, the JPL tour is for you. Fun family outing, but wear walking shoes and be prepared for stairs. Beautiful setting tucked up against the San Gabriel Mountains.",Jennifer V
50,Explore the solar system.,See where the fleet of probes that explore our solar system are assembled and managed. You can see the Mission Control where all of the probes are controlled: whether it is the Juno probe exploring Jupiter or watching data being received from the still functioning Voyager 1 you will find them all here. Of course I can't forget there is also that fleet of satellites and rovers on and around Mars. Well worth the visit if you can arrange it. There are only small group tours once a week and you have to call a head to see if you can schedule a tour. I would call months in advance. If you can make it work than definitely go.,Brendan K
50,Techies and Trekkies this one's for you,"After doing campus tour of Cal Tech, made the 15 minute drive to JPL, and it's like another world. Have to make tour arrangements weeks in advance, and it was worth every second of it. Son is showing interest in Aerospace engineering so we were in heaven, it is a working lab so they can only show you so much and you are constantly reminded that scientist are working around you so stay low and quiet. Great pics, great video narrated by Harrison Ford, and great opportunity to see various sat's and space probes/vehicles. It was the highlight of our trip, and if you have a techie or trekkie in your family, put this stop on your tour of the galaxy.",Vic S
40,Fascinating for the Science Buff or Simply Curious,"My husband and I took the free public tour of JPL recently. For the science buff , it is fascinating, and kids clearly love it too. (If you're a fan of the TV program, The Big Bang Theory, this is where the gang works, hypothetically.) Advance reservations are required and must be made online, where you can choose a future date and time convenient to you. There are 2 tours per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Warning: The JPL campus is set on a hillside and a fair amount of walking, including lots of stairs is involved. Restrooms and water fountains are scattered about, so that is not a problem, but taking a bottle of water with you is still a good idea.The tour starts with a video explaining the history of JPL and an overview of what they do,which is quite interesting in itself. Guests are treated to a view of the ""clean room"" where spacecraft are assembled, and of the active Mission Control Room, where you'll see scientists monitoring the various space missions/flights in progress real time. I found it surprising how many projects/missions are on-going....at least a half dozen or more, each fascinating in it's own way. In addition, there are scale models of many of the spacecraft and beautiful graphic displays explaining the various missions, past and present. The kids on the tour particularly enjoyed seeing themselves in an interactive infrared photography display. The tour guides are friendly and open to many and any questions. The tour gave me a real appreciation for what NASA/JPL does and a lot to ponder, All in all, well worth the time.",Marie G
50,"So glad they opened their ""House"" for family.","JPL does their once a year open house and it was great. They have so many sites with different topics and activities for kids. My kids got ""ran over"" by a Mars Rover demonstration. It was great! I wish they would do it more often not just 1 weekend a year. They also had food trucks, a lot of learning from scientists and I think we'll go back every year as the kids get older so they can learn more. But I know my kids (4 and 5 y.o) did enjoyed it.",Janetsplanet
50,A pinnacle science event,"The JPL open house is a MUST EVENT for the science fan of any age. Words cannot describe the access, the science, and the people. The people make the event- the director of solar system exploration standing there chatting about the subject, the person who manages Cassini just chatting about developing the program with my seven year old were all once in a lifetime experiences for myself and sons. Thank you JPL",scott s
40,Open House Overview,"Tickets: If you're lucky enough to get tickets, there's a mobile option to scan your tix off your phone. Bring your ID. According to repeat attendees and staff, this new format of limited tickets seems to be working better.Parking/Entrance: For a 9 am start time, go EARLY for free parking in the JPL Lot. Or, go late and catch the folks that are leaving. Line to get into the lot and to the campus started well before 8:30 am.Security: Plenty of it. Your bags are checked, there's even a dog on patrol to sniff bags.Length of visit: 2-3 hours should cover you for the popular exhibits.What to wear/bring: Comfy shoes, sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, water and/or snacks.Big campus. Bigger than Disneyland. Lots of walking and stairs (but elevators and ramps available for strollers and wheelchairs) Bring cash. Some food booths only take cash. Although there is a Bank of America ATM near the JPL ""store.""The Waiting Game: If you've done your homework and visited JPL's website/web app, you'll know which exhibits are the most popular and have the longest lines. For lines that extend outside, there are big tents to keep you out of the sun. JPL also does a pretty good job at keeping you entertained while in line. For instance, at the Spacecraft Assembly Facility, there's large flat screen monitors playing videos and there's a guy on a mic for Q & A. Or there's signage to read while in line with Did You Know facts, pictures or information banners.However, there are areas that you just won't have any protection against the hot sun. At the Alien exhibit, they easily could have broken up the line so that the crowd could stand in shade until there was room to get into the building. I even suggested that to a volunteer as I baked in the sun, but she just shrugged at me.Kid Friendly?: Depends on how old your kid is. As I mentioned, lots of walking...lots of waiting. I suppose that's what the ice cream stands are for?Exhibits: If you aren't a big science buff, this event might not be your thing. My biggest advice is to talk to the JPL staff. Any time we spoke with a staff member, they were extremely informative and suddenly a piece of machinery (we could have just walked past) became extremely interesting. But you have to engage.Staff/Volunteers: For the most part, very friendly and passionate about what they do and they are eager to share. I never felt like they were talking over our heads. There were a few stick in the muds...An example - a staff member at the Clean Room Observation gave a very brief intro, but said he had no time for Q & A and asked us to keep moving, which was a bummer because the Clean Room is one of the most popular sites. Sure, there were people outside of the Clean Room to talk to, but the moment in the Clean Room was lost.Restrooms: Plenty. If not indoors, there's Andy Gump Portables, they even have some of those big trailer Executive Line Portables. Fancy.Food: Plenty of food stands - BBQ, Mexican Food, Kettle Korn, Shaved Ice, Pizza, Lemonade, Ice cream...Pluses: Plenty of signage, maps, visible staff to assist. Again, when we did talk to staff, they were super informative and we learned a lot. Without this interaction, I don't think we would have enjoyed the open house as much. Food, drink and portables all well situated.Minuses: The heat. The distance to buildings. Obviously little can be done about those things. Really wanted to go to Microdevices Lab, but it was just too far on foot in the heat. Perhaps a shuttle?I don't know what I was expecting but the Office of Safety and Mission Success turned out to be just a tent with posters.We are glad we went, but I don't know that we'd ever go again unless it became easier to to attend and more Open Houses were offered during the year. I'm sure it's a huge endeavor to put an event of this size together, but it's obviously very successful judging by the turnout.",Just T
50,The Mecca for Science Buffs,My Dad worked there for over 30 years. So I have been there many a time. If you go by all means go to the visitor's center as they have some neat stuff to see. Also if you are a School Teacher they will mail you some really great photos of Outer Space if you ask nicely.,David L
50,"Interesting, exciting and always something new","Find out about tours and take one. See space probes, rockets, videos and photos of missions. Look through a window at real scientists (Rocket science) working in the dust free environmentAnd if you look carefully there are deer on the campus that just like to hang out. History is being made here every day. Check for lectures , too.",Louise A
50,Our Visit to JPL,"Every year we make the short drive, and long walk :) , to visit JPL. We make sure to get the free bags at the gates and load up with goodies from the displays within the facility. They have so much. The large moving robots are one of our favorites. These aren't toys either, these are real machines, and you get to speak with the people who developed them!Another favorite is the machine shop where you can see the tool which are used to build the actual components going in to space, and speak to the people who operate the equipment.Vehicle assembly and the Q&A booths are also a big treat for us.Bring water, 20$ for a few hotdogs and sodas (food is reasonable in price, lines tend to be long, but move well so don't skip off the line at first), park offsite and walk in. Seriously park nearby and walk in, once the place closes thousands of people are trying to get out one road. If you walk 1/2 offsite you will save yourself an hour getting out.This is a MUST Visit location if you're in town when they have their opened house.I can only choose one for the type of visit, but in reality it is good for:CouplesFamily, young and oldAnd Friends.",ckeveny
50,Excellent tour and the price is right,"You can reserve one of the free tours of this place but you need to do so well in advance. Given the price (free!) and the level of interest, you need to sign up as soon as reservations are available. That said, the 2.5 hour tour is excellent. JPL is the lead in unmanned space (and deep space) exploration. There is a short film to start and some great exhibits with full and half size models of the various satellites. The highlight of the tour, IMO, is the visit to mission control where all of the unmanned space programs are monitored, from Voyager 1 which is 12 billion miles away to the satellites circling the outer planets. Fascinating.",steveprez
50,Walk through Space History,What an amazing place. So many of our major space explorations have begun at JPL. Walking around the campus is very inspirational. The museum is fantastic and during their Open House you get to tour all the buildings.,Dwilcox000
50,Fantastic!,"My husband is a space geek so it was a dream come true to visit JPL. The guides are SO knowledgable and very friendly too. There are ""Open House"" weekend days once in a while but I hear they can be incredibly crowded. We managed to join a small private tour group on a week day. A great place to visit no matter how you manage it!",NatAtHome

50,"Great place to tour, sign up in advance","Saw the other views talking about how crowded it was and worried. It took some time, but we went online and got approved for a tour. There were only 30 or so people in the group and we had 2 dedicated tour guides. Very cool tour, lasted for about 2.5 hours and provided some neat behind the scenes looks. And we got to keep our lanyards at the end of the tour.",Jim A
40,"JPL Open House, amazing but prepare for the long lines!","Excitement of space exploration and renewed interest in the science of space. Take a private tour,no line!",Chona3855
20,"I really wanted to love it, but...","Please not that this is a review of the open house in October 2015.First, the 5 star points. I have no doubt JPL is an amazing place--they are doing incredible work, whether it be deep space telemetry, solar system exploration or earthbound science. From engineering to AI, robotics to exobiology, JPL is at the forefront of incredible discoveries about our universe every day. Everyone we met who works there was enthusiastic, knowledgable, and helpful.But...I'm a huge space science fan--rockets, rovers, manned missions, asteroid exploration--and I was hoping for a day filled with accessible demos of the coolest stuff around, combined with lots and lots of tech-speak. Instead, in addition to the INSANE crowds (lines of 1-2 hours for many of the exhibits), all we found was 5 minutes of gawking at mission control, cleanroom, conference posters, combined with too many food vendors to name and no room to move. Next time we'll opt for a tour, and hopefully gain a real appreciation of what no doubt is an extraordinary place.",Meryl M
20,Overcrowded - Stay home and watch videos on youtube,"JPL is an amazing place, but it was just not setup to handle the over 30,000 that showed up for open house. Lines backed up to the highway by 8:30am, due to overcrowding they closed the gates at 10:30 but it took a long time for signs to go up, so people kept coming and getting turned around. 5 of the 21 exhibits are movies, so nothing special. We visited the ""Space Flight Operations"" which is one of the most popular exhibits. 50 people gathered up around to give some basic information, move into first room to watch video, move into second room to watch another video while taking pictures of the ""Space Flight Operations"" room, and then out the door to get your sticker. Nothing special other than the bragging right to say 'I was there'Open House needs more demonstrations. Scientists talking in front of posters or holding toy sized prototypes explaining things is just not engaging.I was hoping to see something I could not from youtube, hoping to learn something I could not from looking it up on the internet. It did not happen.All the JPL people I talked to were knowledgable, enthusiastic and doing their best, but the open house as an event failed.",Yip123
40,must stop for science buffs . . .lines and wait times are insanely long,I want to preface this by saying the work that JPL does is a great thing and having an annual FREE open house is a very nice gesture. We arrived at 7:45AM and the lines were long JUST to get in . we got into a few of the more popular exhibits before the lines got ridiculously long. next year they should think about having tickets for some of the movie showings rather that having kids and the elderly wait in line in 90 degree heat.,Mark T
20,Long Long Long Wait time,"Our first and probably the last time coming to JPL Open House..... We have been checking the updates on their Facebook event page. They suggested to arrive no later than 9am, maybe 8:30am before they open. we got off Fwy210 (Arroyo) at 8am, continued to follow the GPS. Guess what? Big sign flashing ""No Access to JPL. Parking Lot Closed"". Now all the cars are making U-turn! Traffic started to back up right around the off ramp. We then saw the small arrow sign to go to Oak Grove Dr. Bumper to Bumper..... took us 40 minutes to get to the front gate. Two security checking the cars... slow down the traffic again. Then follow the traffic to go in the parking structure (2 parking structures on site). 10 minutes later... finally parked the car.3 Entrance to go in. Two entrance on Parking Lot A. One entrance on Parking Lot B. When we drove pass the front gate, there are already hundreds and hundreds of people waiting in line. If you come early, it is true to get in JPL faster and find a parking spot quicker; HOWEVER, you still need to wait in line till 9am under the sun!!!!There are over 21 sites and 5 of them are movie screenings. Movie screenings sites' lines are even longer because.... AIR-CONDITIONING!! It is super hot today. Also, the movie screening line stops moving when the movie is playing. The staffs told us to check out other sites first then come back later. NO WAY~ the line would just get longer not shorter!!5 Stars- Awesome idea to open to the public, super educational & informative!!!- Many Information Booths on site, they give great direction where you want to go!- Super knowledgeable JPL employees on site to answer all our questions!- Many food vendors selling food & drinks! (feel like in the county fair?)1 Star- Since it is open invitation, no ticket or reservation needed. It is so hard to predict how many people are showing up. They can't control the crowd.- Since it is first come first serve, people are going there super early. However, they still need to wait on the side walk till 9am when they open the entrance. Either you stuck in traffic for hours or wait in line for hours.- Once the parking lot is full, they close the gate. Many people are still trying to exit the freeway, they have no idea the gate is close. Waiting in the traffic for hours. When they get to the gate then they are forced to make a U-turn to find their own parking. What a waste of time?- The Open House Web App is such a smart idea. However, it is NOT accurate or updated!!- It is great that JPL found so many food vendors selling food and drinks but what's the next issue.... RESTROOM!!! I saw a line and asked the people, ""what exhibit is this?"" They said, ""restroom line""! Really??- After 3 hours there... it is time to leave. Guess what? No single sign/direction where to exit? There are staffs inside the parking lot direct you to the parking spot. But after you leave the parking lot, you are totally on your own.We are still glad we went at least once. But because of the unpredictable crowd and wait time, we will definitely pass next year.",ILoveFoodComa
50,If Traveling the Earth is Not Enough...,"I'm not a space junkie--though my husband is--but even I found the tour fascinating. There's a lot to learn about the Mars Rover and other expeditions and scientific exploits in our solar system. We went as a couple, but I can imagine children would enjoy this as well. I actually found it more engaging than the Air and Space Museum in DC, but perhaps that's because it is both more narrowly focused and less overwhelmingly crowded.You have to make reservations literally months in advance, so plan ahead if you'd like to see it. It's worth the effort.",TLDinPortland
50,VERY EDUCATING,"This is a wonderful place to visit when they have their yearly Open House, usually in October. I'm not into technical things (understatement!), yet I still enjoy touring the premises, looking at all the displays and educational clips, and chatting with the employees...they're usually more than willing to break things down to a pre-K level for me...as I said, I'm not good with technical and engineering things. I always learn something new each year, and what they can do never seizes to amaze me! Definitely a fun and educational experience!",Tina C
50,"If you can find a way to do a tour, do it!","JPL is a NASA site, but it is unique, in that it is run by Cal Tech. Originally it was Von Karmann and his students setting off rockets in the Arroyo, and it progressed from there to what it is today. If it is at all possible to get on a tour, it is well worth your effort. You can see spacecraft being assembled in clean rooms and much of the history of the unmanned space program.",1goofybird
50,To Infinity and Beyond!,"Home of many of Nasa's non-manned missions, from voyager to Mars Rover to Galileo. They invite the general public to visit on Public Open House Day. Each year.

You need to go to thei JPL website, and scroll to the bottom to the Public Events section. Both Tours and Open House are links in that area. It is absolutely essential that you go to the website and reserve in advance. List all tour guests by their full names (as recorded on their photo IDs). Parking is free and so are the tours. You will need to bring your government issued photo ID or you won't get in. Exit 22 off of the 210 Freeway, Berkshire / Oak Grove Drive. North on Oak Grove Drive to JPL.

50,Not to be missed,"My wife and I have been living here in the Pasadena area for 20 months, and we finally got to JPL. Than Goodness. What a wonderful place. Be warned....you must arrange your visit months in advance, so don't be disappointed. There is lots of walking, lots of steps, but though I am in my 80's and walk with a cane, I was able to manage.

For those of us who grew up with space exploration, it is a real treat to see Voyager 1, the Mars Rovers, and to sit in Mission Control. The introductory film is well-done, and the guides cram a lot of information into the tour. This is a wonderful experience, and FREE!",Mary R
50,Part of history,"I was fortunate to have a private tour in a small group from an employee friend. For those of us that grew up with the ""space race"" this was a real thrill to see the control room and displays that have been so much a part of our history.

There is an informative film narrated by Harrison Ford. And you get to visit mission control (yes, it's really active for the probes controlled by JPL) and the assembly building. The tour is 2.5 hours, which is a bit long considering the ground covered (not much). On the other hand, there probably isn't a whole lot more worth seeing. I'd recommend they shorten the tour to about 1.5 hours and let people stick around longer for Q&A if they wish. You must book about 6 months in advance. I'm glad I went. But good to have some background before visiting. Not for amateurs or young kids. Please leave the kids at home, this is too slow, boring and over the top for them. Not recommended until high school age.",RTWtraveler213

50,NASA Deep Space & ET Adventure,Very nice museum. The von Karman lecture series is well worth your time. Visitor Parking is right next to the entrance. Educational outreach to schools and financial support to FIRST robotic teams is stellar!Open House is very educational. Suggest going Sunday morning to avoid the public throngs of people. Employee volunteers make it very interesting. Catch a few JPL movies and then see the public mission control room and Mars exhibits. Along the way you can learn about space missions from the various exhibits.,James W
50,Excellent - even if you are not a scientist!,"You have to book the public tour months in advance - but it was worth it. The crowd is very small and there weren't any lines (still had problems finding parking though). I went with my husband and teenage son who are ""nerdy"" and loved it - but I don't know anything about this stuff and loved it as well. We even got to see an actual launch.

40,Worth Seeing,"I was here recently for one of the JPL Open Houses. This is a really nice facility located close to the 210 Freeway. On the day we went the crowds were tremendous. Even though JPL has several parking lots, getting to them was difficult due to the huge crowds. Lines for many of the exhibits were 1 or 2 hours. We waited for over an hour to get in the fabrication facility where pieces of the Mars Landers were made. For some of the exhibits, such as the demonstration of the Mars Lander propulsion systems, there was no line.All of the employees who presented information were enthusiastic and informative. If you like lots of technical engineering detail you will like this. I would like to go back to see some of the buildings I missed on this trip. We missed the spacecraft assembly facility due to the long line of more than an hour and a half.If you are going to an Open House I would advise going early before the crowds arrive later in the afternoon. Also, they did have food and drink for sale at various booths around the facility.",JohnB00007
50,Amazing discoveries in space science,NASA's JPL has been involved in major discoveries on the nature of our solar system and beyond. One can argue it is the best return on scientific investment for NASA. You will learn about these scientific advances and much more. Amazing museum shows the flotilla of rovers to Mars. You need to arrange for a visit in advance--but worth the trip!,jz-60

From the other reviews about weekend Open Houses, I guess that's what I should have tried to do. This is a guided tour and the information was interesting, but it seemed like we walked more than we saw. There were also several videos in the tour.

You could spend hours and hours there looking at all of the displays and talking with the incredibly knowledgable staff. Just get there early, up to a half hour before they open so you can see a lot before the crowds arrive. By 12p the place was packed and many lines were forming. The replica of the Voyager was very cool to see along with a film. The SMAP was available to see (which is rare) and replicas of the Mars Rovers. The grounds are expansive so wear good walking shoes.

50,2014 JPL Open House,"JPL hosted a two day open house for the public over this past weekend. It was absolutely amazing. We got access to many areas that are never open to the public for their regular tours, and it was also so heartwarming to see so many kids from infant to their 80s getting their ""space geek"" on! Definitely find out when the next one will be held and plan your trip around it!",DrSukie
50,Science For Everyone,"Visited JPL. I thought that this was simply amazing. I enjoyed learning about space, rover, etc. The tour is not long. The information is laid out in a way that even people with no scientific backgrounds can learn.There is seating through out. I was not rushed. I was able to take my time and look around.The staff was helpful.",AJ S
40,It is rocket science!,"I was very fortunate to have a personal tour from one of my friends who works there. It was fascinating! We saw the museum, the gift shop, the place where spacecraft are built,and she also took me around to several buildings where real scientists were doing real work. I enjoyed seeing smart young people busy dreaming up innovative processes and building high tech equipment. I felt like I was seeing the workplace of the future; a place where people are encouraged to be creative at work.",reptilist
50,For the Space fan,"Lots of stuff going on at JPL, Mars Rover, SMAP Launch, Cassini still bringing on great science. Get a tour there or go to the open house will worth it.",Hockey_Tish
50,Can give you goosebumps,"A wonderful, free tour of one of our nation's space centers. JPL, with around 5000 employees, is affiliated with NASA and the CA Institute of Technology. If you're lucky, you may be able to see the lunar rover involved in testing.",pamd927
50,"Facilities a bit tired, but docents out of this world! PLAN AHEAD","The open house was cancelled last year, so I haven't been there for over a year, but this is a perennial favorite for any space fan. The labs, projects, movies, robots, rovers, satellites, and most importantly, the scientists and engineers make a visit to JPL an exciting combination of space science education and science history. They have a few public events each year, which are usually presentations in the main visitor area and don't include much of a tour of the rest of the facility, so if you really want to see things, brave the crowds at the annual open house the next time they have one. Or find someone who knows someone who works there (or at Caltech) and see if you can get a behind-the-scenes tour. Well worth it, but not a last minute thing.",EBrowne
50,"needs advance planning, but the visit is out of this word","let me start by saying that this is not a NASA center where you show up at the front door and visit. not even the visitor center (which does not exist). there are only a few ways to get beyond the guard shack: either you catch one of the open houses (once a year or so) or sign up well in advance for one of the guided tours (think 4 months in advance) or you know someone on the inside who will escort you or you work there. I was lucky enough to experience 3 out of the 4 (won't tell which one I missed) over the last 6 years.the lab is built on the side of a steep hill; the auditorium/museum (and informal visitor center) is on a flat walk from the front gate; anything else requires going up/down stairs and roads. Scale and life-size models of spacecrafts, pictures and animations of outer planets, the control center, the engineering model for the latest Mars rover, a fully instrumented twin of the unit working on Mars, the clean room where satellites are assembled. What you get to see depends in large part on what is happening on the day of your visit; with (a lot of) luck the rover will be out in the 'Mars yard' going through its paces in preparation to drilling a rock on another planet, or climbing a hill, or scooping up sand.Definitively would recommend the visit to anyone.",gpcd
50,Learn about outer space,"I worked at JPL for many years so don't claim to be objective. But every year they have an Open House which more than 40,000 people attend. So locals love it too. On other dates reservations are required for tours and must be made months in advance. Call their Public Affairs Office for information.",suz91101
50,Great place,The people are very friendly and the visitors center has great staff to show for those who like or not astronomy. Great for kids.,PallasParis
40,I learned so much here,Very informative and so much to see. I went on an arranged tour. Do not know about reservations for smaller parties,Chris T
50,Rockets Not Jets,"If you look into it, there are more than a few counterdictions in JPL.Using jet in the name when it was always about rockets was just to not confuse the rubes who pay for it.The guy who was the most instrumental in its founding by the name of Jack Parsons was an outstanding scientist, & also a dedicated Mage.I think it really adds to the glamor to be aware of the ambidextrous nature of the man for whom a crater on the moon was named.I have been to JPL twice, back in about 1996 when it was free & easy to go there. I enjoyed seeing exhibits on the many experiments done there. Then we could buy food & eat out on the attractive campus.After 9/11, the area was shut down & may still be so. But I was fortunate to have a friend who is kin to one of the scientists. He got us in.We even got to see inside a laser lab & a chemical lab as well as the usual. We also walked around more freely in the buildings.JPL is not going away. It still has business, but it may metamorphocise to be unrecognizable if you still think rockets are high tech.As Arthur C Clarke, the father of the satellite said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""When in Pasadena, California, do look into the state of tours.",Janetta S
50,Amazingly interesting...,"I was surprised that I could take in a camera, but after hearing it is on 177 acres (twice the area of Disneyland) I knew why. We got to see a lot but realize that much was going on in other places with the 5,000 employees working. Seeing ALL the moon rovers was the most impressive thing for me and showed how far we had come. Also seeing one of the largest ""Clean Rooms"" in the world was impressive, and seeing large models of many Satellites was so interesting. We have come a long way in space and glad we are continuing. in 2014 we launch the SMAP Satellite and saw it being assembled. This is a first rate tour; could NOT stop taking pictures!!",Calif1
40,"Lots of history, very educational and very structured tour","1). Don't come hungry or thirsty! Bring your own bottle of water!2). Don't wear your high heels or professional suits/dresses! Wear something very comfortable such as tennis shoes or walking shoes. Don't wear flip flops.3). Have your camera ready, you will see deer and ducks all over the campus.4). Recommend you have an appreciation for space exploration because you will get feed information about space exploration.5). This is a contracted NASA facility so yes you are actually on a college campus6). You must make reservations and it may have to be 3+ months in advance7). You will be able to take pictures of mission control so don't go by yourself some really cool photo ops.8). Remember government ID required and Citizenship or Green Card otherwise need passport and advance notice if not US Citizen or green card holder.9). Remember this is a research and a factory for rockets so you kids may be bored unless they have a huge interest in engineering and science.",jdreynoldsjr
50,Awesome experience!,"I was part of a workshop hosted on JPL grounds. Staff were friendly, facility is over-the-top amazing. Complete nerdfest!",cy1229
50,Out of this world!,"Friendly, informed, passionate employees treated us to a tour of a lifetime. Visited Mission Control, watched 3D movie about applications of their work and visited many labs and Mars Yard. Don't miss this one!",Andy10of10
50,A must-see on your LA trip,"Jet Propulsion Labs is a joint project of NASA and Cal Tech, the place where very leading-edge satellites and MARS-landers have been designed and built. On their Wednesday afternoon tours they have experts who explain techy topics in language that we all can understand. Then they take you around their space-age facility so you can see their models up close and personal. If you have even a drop of space junkie in you, this is the place.",Conch
50,Fabulous Tours,Fabulous Tour. Must book online a few months ahead. campus a few months before. Nearby Pasadena is a pretty area. Cal Tech campus is great for a walk.,LoveWailea
50,No babies PLEASE!,"Parents, if you have a child that is six years old or younger, PLEASE don't bring them on the tour. Take them to a park. Take them to Disney. Don't take them to JPL.Oh, and telling your two year old to shush twenty times during a movie doesn't work. The first two times should've told you that it's not effective. Don't bring a stroller because you are walking up and down stairs.With that out of the way, this was a great tour. Starts off with Harrison Ford narrating the movie, then you're whisked away to visit several buildings. I wish we could've have visited the testing center.The gift shop is tiny. Not much merchandise to choose from. I overheard the cashier say that they can't order any new merchandise because a new company is taking over. Too bad for us.Despite all that, my boys thoroughly enjoyed visiting JPL.",FloridaSun4me
50,Heavenly!,"Nothing to dislike here, great if you are interested in space. But aren't we all? They want me to say more but I can't really.",Teacupcake
50,Amazing historic facility,We saw the control room and it was unreal! The stories about sending the Mars Rover were very interesting.,blubs99
50,Fascinating tour,"The public tours aren't given that frequently, have to be reserved in advance, and are mobbed. BUT...they're *free* and fascinating. This place is a must if you or a family member is into space exploration. It involves quite a lot of walking, including lots of stairs, so keep that in mind. And very small children might find it trying. I was really glad we made the time to do this tour.",WritingRetreater
50,Very educational,"Went with a group of university students on a trip related to NASA. The tour was not a public tour - I don't believe that JPL is open to the general public. We got to see the Mars Yard and Curiosity Rover, and had a chance to talk with some of the landing team. Most of the students left hoping to someday get to work at a NASA facility.",Ric B
50,World class experience,This is the science equivalent of the Louvre. The history embedded in this location is huge and the satellites that are on exhibit are fascinating. We were able to sit where the mullet haired scientist was when the Mars explorer landed last year.Our group was part of the OLLI college program that allows seniors the opportunity to return to college. Everyone had grown up during the space race and this was a special experience.,Cavydad
40,"Well worth a visit, but make your reservations months in advance","Very interesting tour guides, beautiful campus, with deer inhabitants. It is always interesting to see what is happening in your backyard.",atltoca
50,Big Review,All we can say is this is one of the most interesting places we've been to in the past year. A good place to peak the interest of the young upcoming scientists and armchair astronomers. A must do!,dbajet
10,Definitely not worth it,"I booked our visit 4 months ahead, and I was really excited to visit the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The place itself is amazing, the research and the projects are amazing, the folks there are amazing, the problem is the way the tour is conducted.Too much talk, talk, talk, talk... and then... a video. And then, they insist people to ask questions, and most of them are silly. I was expecting something more ""advanced"", but that seemed to be a tour for people who don't know a thing about space. Also, there were children making a lot of noise, disturbing my attention, and they did not seem to be a bit interested in the tour. That facility definitely does not seem to be a place for children.Basically, it was a tour to a small (but very nice) museum, a long video explaining the celestial bodies of the Solar System, the assembly facility (which had nothing interesting at that time - ok, that happens), the mission control room, and a replica of the rover Curiosity. Very few things for a 3h30 tour. To fill that time, there's too much talking, and that was so boring.Honestly: best to spend your time in the California Sciencenter, to see the real space shuttle Endeavour, some other real space devices, and many other cool things, not being restricted by some people speaking endlessly.",pvdesign
50,Space is the place,What a great experience. Driving up to the Laboratory entrance alone is cool. Reminds me of Disney's Mission to Mars. Cool retro vibe. Programs we saw were very well done. Updated and current. These folks take space seriously and are friendly about sharing information about the cosmos and beyond. Go you must.,sidz101
50,Must for a space fan,"Lots of walking, but well worth it. An excellent tour of a real live working NASA center. Highly recommended.",Hall C
50,Science up close and personal,"The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been involved in the exploration of space from the very beginnings. They have assembled space probes there and continue to monitor them. It is a fascinating place to visit and I highly recommend visiting their website to find out when their open house is next year and make plans to attend. If you're at all interested in space exploration, you won't want to miss it.",Clive M
50,Watch for The Open House,"I grew up around & have watched this place grow from a couple of trailers to this massive science & space lab. Nothing else in this world (or several others) is like it. I didn't know they had made the open house an annual event. I always got in as a media member. But it is astonishing. Be sure to check out what the Mars Rovers are up to - they are ""driven"" from here.",jg3arrow
50,Nerd Heaven,"We got an excellent tour (signed up via their website). Once you get past the first security guards, everyone is very friendly. Bring proof of your reservation. Beautiful campus and an exciting vibe, as we visited just before the Mars rover Curiosity successfully landed.",Leslie S
40,"Once-Yearly Open House - Hard to Find, Worth the Wait","They don't seem to make a big deal of advertising this, but they still have tens of thousands of people show up the one weekend a year they are open to the public. FREE and lots of waiting in line, but it's worth it for all the direct access to the very scientists and technicians who are working directly with our outer space exploration and research programs. A truly unique experience to talk to leading minds and committed people. Bring your comfy shoes - it's hilly - and it's southern California in June, so come in layers as you never know what weather you're going to get.We saw 3-D movies, saw the ""practice areas"" for the Mars Rover, learned about the Jupiter probes past and future, and saw more information about asteroids and probes to them than we can remember! Tons of scouts and families all over the place, but it's a very well thought-out and organized event. FREE. If you want a full-access pass to a place that normally isn't even open to the public, keep your eyes open for the announcement of the open house and jump when you can.",GibsonCRG
50,JPL Open House,"Interested in the universe at large? Wanna talk to real live rocket scientists? Jet Propulsion Labs has your ticket, and best of all it's FREE to the public, when they have their annual open house in mid-May to early June every year. You will be able to see prototypes of the rovers currently on Mars, and any (as in Curiosity) that are currently en route to the Red Planet. You can enter the Space Flight Operations Center and walk through Mission Control, from whence all robotic missions and all NASA probes going back to Voyager are monitored and piloted. You can see first hand the machine shop where all the parts are crafted and put together. And to commemorate your visit, you can go to the JPL store and buy mission hats, NASA shot glasses and coffee mugs and just about anything else you can imagine with a NASA logo on it. I go here every year and am frankly shocked that I'm only the 3rd reviewer on TripAdvisor for this amazing event!",Yoshi23
50,Famous for the Mars Rovers,Wonderful resource for school projects on space. They hold an open house each year which is informative and fun for everyone.,worldrunner
40,Not bad,"The tour is free, but you need to call to get a reservation. I don't know how parking is because I took a bus. They also have a free bus that goes through nearby Glendale.You wait in the reception area where there are some exhibits and a small gift shop.The 1st part of the tour is a presentation in the auditorium. This is also the press room where they announce the newest discoveries. They give the history of JPL and some of the things they doing now. They also answer any questions throughout the tour.Then they take you next-door to the museum where models of satellites and other exhibits are displayed.Next they split the group to see 2 other rooms, the clean assembly room where you can see them making the next deep space probes and the control room where the tracking stations are coordinated and data is gathered. We got to see this from the VIP lounge.One thing I thought was interesting is that just outside the entrance there is a horse riding club. I recall back in the 50's kids were shifting form being interested in cowboys to being an astronaut",thegreatunknown
