50,Serene,"A beautiful entrance and lovely grounds. Both my parents are here so I visit often whenever I am in town. Always a calming place to reflect and sit for awhile.

50,So peaceful and tranquil,"what a wonderful, spacious and tranquil place. We popped by here, to see Michael Jackson's memorial.

50,A beautiful peaceful oasis,"We went to the memorial park to see Stan Laurel’s grave. It was US mother’s day when we went so although it was quiet when we arrived it soon became extremely busy. It was very moving to see people sat around graves clearly paying their respects. We got chatting to an Armenian man who worked there. He showed us the graves of Debbie Reynolds, Carrie Fisher, and Liberace. He also spent some time explaining the set up of the grave sites. He was also handing out flowers to women for mother’s day which was a lovely touch. I left mine on Stan Laurel’s grave. It was a lovely peaceful morning. You can hear the birds singing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSimpsonfamily

50,What an amazing and serene cemetery!,"Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills has got to be one of the most well kept and serene cemeteries that I have ever seen. I was amazed when a family of deer ran across the grounds during my meeting with planning adviser, Jennifer. Jennifer took me on thorough tour of the cemetery to show me each different area and types of burials available. She could not have been more accommodating. I never felt pressured to purchase anything and all of the questions I asked were answered in detail. Once I decided on the burial needs that would be best for my family, Forest Lawn worked with me to make my selections possible.When I returned to work after my meeting with Jennifer, my colleagues asked if I was weirded out by visiting a cemetery. I can honestly say that I had the opposite reaction. I felt calm and content while visiting the beautiful site and knowing that I had handled this inevitable step in all of our lives. I trust Forest Lawn to conclude my final wishes with dignity and professionalism.Thank you Jennifer and Forest Lawn!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdechris

50,See the resting place of many stars,"This is a lovely memorial park with the final resting place of stars from today (Carrie Fischer and Debbie Reynolds) and those of yesterday (Stanley Laurel and Mary Pickford.) It isn't just for film people though; there are 250,000 people interred here. There are no upright grave memorials, but there are some beautiful statues throughout the park.

50,Home of the departed Stars,"Having a morbid side and being in California, my family and I took a trip the cemetery. I would also advise you to use the website seeing-stars.com for guidance. It shows where the stars are buried. And because they won't tell you where they are in the office, due to privacy. The grounds are amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanj132019

30,Death becomes Forest Lawn.,"Death becomes Forest Lawn. Hollywood Hills is secondary, perhaps the overflow area, for the main Forest Lawn in Glendale. The chapel is nice, but it’s too close to the freeway for a quiet calm funeral. The view over Warner Brothers back lot makes up for many location problems. At least there is something to watch from the grave site. Surprising, people bring picnics and hang out in the memorial park. Overall, a nice place that I am not hankering to get into any time soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Beautiful and Peaceful,"Beautiful place to visit. We found quite a few of the movie stars graves. We were happy to have found Stan Laurel's grave being a huge fan of Laurel and Hardy.

40,Beautiful!,"Came up here simply to visit Bette Davis' grave site, but was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful this place actually is. The grounds were well maintained, and being up in the Hollywood hills, it was very peaceful and serene. The only thing I was disappointed with is there were no signs to point you in the direction you were going. Drove around for about 30 minutes before deciding to take a chance on another turn and eventually found where she was buried.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kozzzzz
50,Peaceful and Scenic Resting Place of Some Famous Stars,"Keep in mind there are SIX ""Forest Lawn"" cemeteries in Southern California. You need to clearly know which cemetery has the graves of whatever stars you want to pay respects to. My main objective was to find Debbie Reynolds new grave. As maps aren't provided, Google ""Bette Davis"" on your phone and save a picture of her grave. --driving around you'll see a large walled area on a hill--Bette's grave is outside the formal entrance. Inside there's in-ground, cremation, wall and monument burials. Finding the graves of LIberace and Debbie/Carrie Fisher is quite easy if you have pictures on your phone to guide you. A very peaceful and lovely place to visit--easy to find off the freeway but you need a car to navigate inside. Security patrols are multiple and often but don't intrude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williambJ8243XH
50,Lovely visit to my childhood friend's mom,"Went to see my friend's mom. She was near Bette Davis, Liberacci, Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher. Lovely, gracious, quiet. Staff was helpful.

We wandered around the grounds for about an hour until security asked if we needed assistance. We explained that we were looking at stars gravesites and the guard walked away but did not seem pleased about us being there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdin10ac
30,Tough to navigate,"Keep in mind that there are two locations of this cemetery with the same name, one in Glendale and the other in Hollywood Hills. They do not appreciate stargazers and don't have maps for celebrity graves. If you are looking for help finding particular graves, visit seeing-stars.com, which has a very helpful general guide. But keep in mind this website brings you to general sections then you have to find the actual grave and there can be 100 graves in a section. Most grave markers are flat plaques, making it more difficult. So bring lots of patience or visit Westwood Village Cemetery instead. Much smaller and tons of famous celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741

50,Strange to want to see but very much worth it,We were in town for a few days and being a heavy metal fan and knowing the final resting place of a personal hero Ronnie James Dio is here I thought I'd go pay my respects. This is the best kept cemetery I have ever been in. There are a lot of celebrities here and the best way to find their grave sites is to use the seeing-stars website as they have a step by step guide on all the spots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamieg84

50,Interesting and Unique,"Weird giving a cemetery 5 stars. Say what you want on our last 2 trips to LA, we have visited famous cemeteries and seeked Hollywood's elite in their final resting place.Our visit to Forest Lawn visit was partly due to a coworker who has a relative they wanted us to visit for them (we did find the site and paid our respects).The grounds are beautiful and once you master the map you can find any area with ease. The have a section that you can walk through and see where some the celebrities are buried or entombed.Call it unique, interesting, weird or creepy, but it was like a mission for us to find the celebrities from Liberace, Betty Davis, Mclean Stevenson to Andy Gibb. Though the map has Lucy still marked, she has moved to her hometown of Jamestown, NY.If you have a few hours and looking for something different, then visit Forest Lawn or the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelforfun2009
50,Wonderful,Wasnt sure about visiting this Park but was the most beautiful place to see. Cant believe how big an area it covers and it is so beautifully kept.

50,In Joyous Remembrance!,"Forest Lawn, Glendale is not just a cemetery – it is an art gallery, a museum a Hollywood tourist attraction with architectural masterpieces showcased here. It’s the final resting place of movie stars. The grounds are so huge, you will need a map to find a particular grave. When it comes to locating celebrities, the staff do not give you any information. It has a replica of Rudyard Kipling’s church and you can view the world's largest permanently mounted religious painting in the world in a state-of-the-art theatre. 'The Hall of the Crucifixion' and Resurrection measuring 195 feet (59 m) in length by 45 feet (14 m) in height is the panoramic painting by the Polish artist Jan Styka ""The Crucifixion."" It has reproductions of famous works of art (1500 statues). It is the only place in the world containing replicas of all of Michaelangel’s works in one place. The castings were taken from the originals and the marble used were from the same quarries in Italy as his original sculptures. David and Moses will keep you spellbound and the stained glass recreation of Leonardo da Vinci’s ‘The Last Supper’ in the Memorial Court of Honor is truly awesome. William Bouguereau's 84x60 inch, oil on canvas painting, created in 1881 titled the ""Song of the Angels"" is one of the most famous objects in the permanent collection. Don’t miss the large mosaic - The Signing of the Declaration of Independence and also the 13-foot (4.0 m)-high statue of George Washington. Ronald Regan was married here at the ""Wee Kirk 'o the Heather"". The huge memorial park does not have any upright grave markers – instead it has huge trees, rolling green hills, water fountains and splendid statuary. The main gates of Forest Lawn – Glendale are claimed to be the world's largest wrought-iron gates. You will need a car to visit. Pick up a map at the information kiosk at the entrance of the grounds just to find your way around this massive park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
40,My parents are buried here and I go frequently but it is a beautiful place just to go.,"the two churches are beautiful. One is just like the Old Church in Boston.

Sculptures are everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570leonardoc
50,Nice visit,"One of the interesting things to do in LA is visit the cemeteries. This is one of the greatest ones. There are 2 Forest Lawns - this one and the one in Glendale. Each is huge, feature lots of interesting things to see and there are, of course, the graves of the stars. Most of the ""biggest"" are in the Glendale site but this one is worth a visit. DO NOT visit a cemetery thinking that they will give you a map of the stars graves - they do not. Instead check out http://www.seeing-stars.com/ He will give you advice and directions on where you can see the most interesting sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
50,Beautiful,"Beautiful resting place. We had word that there was a famous memorial here that we went looking for, but instead we just wandered around peacefully. Had a look at the statues of Abe and some of the resting places. Tried to have a look at one of the chapels and nearly walked in on a funeral so we felt we'd overstayed our welcome and got out of there. But it really is a lovely place to walk around (if you're into that morbid stuff) went with a few of the lads, but just in general, a good place to have a peaceful bit of quiet time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nawilliamson89
50,Peaceful and serene place,"The intent of ""the builder"" of the Forest Lawn cemetaries was to create a place for the living to come and enjoy nature, history, and art. He has definitely accomplished that for those that just randomly stumble into these parks. The views of the surrounding mountains, the memorials set throughout, are all worth a visit to just come and walk around the grounds, and discover something peaceful amidst the bustle of LA.If you're looking for Michael Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor, or others, the Glendale location is different from this location. Although you will still find people like Bette Davis buried here. The grounds are well kept, and the wild life you will see just driving around is sometimes surprising. Once, while writing under one of the oaks, three giant bucks came and laid down in the field in front of me. It was amazing. Little moments like that are why I think Forest Lawn is one of the best kept secrets in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
50,"Somber, peaceful and a lot of history buried here.","This is the smaller of the Hollwood and Glendale Forest Lawn Cemeteries, but it is so breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful.

Never mind the fact that a lot of classic celebs buried there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleOIncognito
40,It is hard to say that a cemetery is beautiful.,"Went to see Michael Jackson´s tumb but according to the employees they cannot tell you where the famous are buried to protect their privacy which I understand.

We wanted the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Glendale. This one did have the beautiful mosaic art and we have a brief visit and drive to see these. Make sure to know which ""Forest Lawn"" you are wanting. If you are seeking a particular person's burial site, RESEARCH it before you arrive. They will not give out locations of individuals. The attendant at the gate was helpful and gave us information to get to the art mosaics, along with directions how to get to Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureexperience1

40,Do your own research and you'll find the celebs,"Grab a map from the receptionist desk next to the flower shop. This will do nothing for you though other than show you which plots are where. There is no guide to celebrity graves and the staff really try to convince you not to bother to look. Use your iPhone to pull up the Wikipedia list of who is buried here and then use ""findagrave.com"" to get you to the grave itself. It takes a bit of time but was a fun scavenger hunt. We found everyone we'd come seeking and more: Bette Davis, Liberace, Lou Rawls, Michael Hutchence, Andy Gibb, John Ritter, Isabel Sanford, Sandra Dee, Ronnie James Dio...The grounds are gorgeous and a car is a must to navigate the vast space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amybatt
50,"Peaceful, lovely setting","This huge, beautifully kept area in Griffith Park is the final resting place for many important people, as well as ordinary folk who choose to be buried there.. There are several churches, including a replica of the Old North Church on site. We drove through the park, stopping to visit the memorials, but not the individual graves. The park is dedicated to the history of North America. Particularly impressive is the huge wall of mosaic scenes depicting the ""Birth of Liberty"" from the voyage of the Mayflower to the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktowne. Also meaningful is the huge bronze September 11th memorial plaque, and the Plaza of Meso-American Heritage, dealing with the early civilizations of Mexico. The Hall of Liberty was closed to the public the day we visited, as a function was going on inside, but use of the restrooms was permitted.A serene setting with beautiful views of the area, it is a welcome break from the hustle & bustle of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryEllenB_12

It is large and the gate people won't tell you where all of them are, so you need to find them on your own. Bette Davis and Liberace are two of the easiest, just up the hill to the left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnTheBear
