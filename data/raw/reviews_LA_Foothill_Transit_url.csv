50,Clean Buses,"It's been a long time since I rode the bus. Now it's cleaner and more quiet. And the most important thing, they are mostly ""on-time"". Drivers are always courteous and friendly. They did a pretty good job on upgrading the buses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeysii
50,Great Free service to get around,"I'm post transplant and staying at City of Hope Hospital for the next 100 days. This free bus system is great and takes us to anywhere in the town of Duarte. Several strip malls, food, Walmart, Target, Etc. It wasn't crowded and the driver was very helpful. Picks up right in front of City of hope Blue and Green Lines have different stops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526kennethm
40,Good commuter bus near W. Covina City Hall,"On weekday mornings, I catch lines 496 or 498 by W. Coviona City Hall on Sunset Avenue, near the parking structure for the courts. There is commuter parking on the upper floor of the structure for a small fee. Between 7:30am and 8:30am, there are buses to downtown LA with a wait between 5-10 minutes. There used to be longer gaps between buses, but it seems they have added more buses to these lines. The bus has only two stops, Cal State LA and USC Medical Center, before reaching downtown. The fare is $4.90 one way. It seems high, but it is worth the price to save the wear and tear on the car and body for the long drive to LA. Usually, I can get my own seat, which is not the case with the Metro Gold line in Irwindale. Drivers are generally courteous. Save some gas and take the bus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
