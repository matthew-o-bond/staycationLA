50,It's a special place,"Whether you are a racing fan or not, this place is a special day out.The atmosphere is so friendly, there's no shortage of facilities, the venue itself is iconic and the sun always shines.........What more do you need?Just Wonderful!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KGS66
50,Beautiful scenic track - worth a visit even if not a racing fan,"This beautiful track, opened in 1934, is such a wonderful throwback to an earlier time. It is worth a visit even if you aren't interested in racing just to see the architecture, decor, and the gorgeous view from the stands. All employees encountered throughout the couple days spent here were incredible.I was actually there for a wedding. I was a little dubious about a wedding at a horse track at first, but as soon as I was onsite I understood. We all had an excellent time and it really was a beautiful site for the event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaredA510
50,Horse üê¥ Track,Not bad. Friendly staff. Scenic views. Good choices for seating and food and drinks. We'll mannered horse fans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirby0122
50,Good roast beef sandwiches,"Of course the Breeder's Cup at Santa Anita 2019 was great. The carved roast beef, corned beef, and turkey sandwiches were tops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasurbaniak1
50,Scotland on tour,Spent two days at the beautiful Santa Anita racetrack. 1st day at the trackside marquee and the 2nd at clockers corner. Both good days but the trackside marquee was my favourite. So relaxed atmosphere which lacks at British racetracks on busy days . Food and drinks were good both days though they should have had the drinks chilled for opening. The racing was of a high standard being breeders cup meeting. Has wetted our appetites to return to the US to watch more racing and have plans in place to come to Kentucky Derby in 2024,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgflooring
50,A beautiful historic race track with a good atmosphere,"We were here for the second day of the Breeders' Cup, and loved the magnificent setting of this race track set in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains with the tall palms and distinctive architecture. Placing bets and buying food and drink was all easy without too much queuing, and the merchandise was very good. We enjoyed the actual racing and hope that very soon a solution can be found to prevent further horse fatalities. We returned to the race track the next day for a free ""Seabiscuit Tour"" which took us around the horses' barns and into some other areas, and we had a very good guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosew537
30,Not as good,We visited for breeders cup day 3 years ago and after a great day decided to visit again. Noticed this time they had hiked the prices up. Our seat this time was in the grandstand as the apron seats had been changed into an expensive dining option. The stairs were very steep and made it a hike for drinks and food. We had no issue with queues for betting or drinks and food. Although that reason would probably be down to the extortionate prices. ‚Ç¨14 for a can of beer with no glass. Food all tacky cheap food. For even an average sit down affair the ticket prices were hiked . From our last visit and the chaos that ensues after racing we left straight after the 2nd to last race. Out easy and straight into an uber and no traffic. Wont be returning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cssoperator
30,Picturesque but not logistically challenged,"Beautiful track and location. Well staffed and multiple tasty dining options. We were there for Breeder‚Äôs Cup and that day changed my feelings and outlook on the sport but that is irrelevant to this review. Extremely friendly people and generous pours for mixed drinks. San Gabriel Mountains backdrop is beautiful throughout the day and into dusk. I have to mention their inadequate crowd control and genuine mess with traffic and ride share. This is probably not an issue the majority of the time of their operations. We just happened to be there on a day with 67k people and it was miserable leaving. That said, back again to their gracious and friendly staff that made the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taxx0702
30,on principle - we wont' return,"we purchased tickets for the breeder's cup before Santa Anita had the problems with the horses dying. After much debate, we decided to go, hoping that the problems had been fixed. If you followed the races, you know they were not fixed.Although this was a beautiful track -- i don't think we will return until (if) there are significant changes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bawgreen
50,Breeders Cup 2019 - Friday and Saturday,"What a wonderful park! Old, but still pretty. Sat in the $20 seats (concrete bench in the shade!) Friday, and Saturday the $50 grandstand seats (row 28). With 67,000 on Saturday, lines were long to bet, and longer to get drinks because the concession‚Äôs computers were down (for about 3 hours)! (How convenient on the busiest day of racing at Santa Anita! Amazing! At least the computers were still going for betting. Friday was a much less crowded day, with all the top rated 2 year old horses in attendance. Nice day on Friday. Much more relaxed. Fun trip both days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doncQ7339OJ
50,Great Day at the Races,"Santa Anita is an iconic place to watch the races. Some of the best horses in the nation compete there. Great views and lots of room to stretch out.

50,There is a reason why they call it The Great Race Place!!,"We have been attending the races here for since the 1980's, and while California racing has declined somewhat in the past 10 years or so this place is still running strong. Definitely a must-do activity when visiting Southern Cal! The best World Class Horse Racing and one of the Classiest Sports Venues in the entire world!

40,good memories,"I use to come here when I was younger and loved the infield. Recently this place has a bad rap for all the horses passing.

Its a wonderful view of the track and the mountains in the early morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomboysreviews
40,Good day out,"We were visiting from Australia and saw the Santa Anita Derby was on so we headed out and had a great day out. Easy to get food and drink, prices a bit expensive but expected that. We just found a table out the front down the straight and watched the races there which was perfect for our day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/74grantg
50,"If you like horse racing, this is one of the great tracks in the US","While there is no overlooking the current tragic situation with the horse breakdowns, which will hopefully be sorted out soon, this is one place that anyone who loves horse racing must go. The backdrop of the track is so visually striking, the flowers and birds are beautiful, and it is simply a fabulous way to spend a perfect day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeneff
50,Better than expected!,This was an unexpected stop in our vacation but so glad we did. Customer service was nice. The atmosphere was energetic and clean. We had a blast watching the races up close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpjim2019
50,Excellent seats in the Turf Club,"Because one of my party was handicapped, we got excellent seats in the Turf Club at the finish line! The waiters were excellent. The breakfast omelettes where huge. We loved the TV sets at our tables to see the beginning of the race before the horses head down the stretch. The persons taking our bets were great fun. A wonderful day for all of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtraveller678
40,Great racetrack,"We went there on a Friday afternoon when it was raining on and off, so relatively few people. Everything worked as advertised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrgnFsh
50,Great Track,"Santa Anita is a fantastic experience if you‚Äôre into Horse Racing.Everyone that I interacted with while here was incredibly cool. I needed to renew my owners license, and had no idea where the CHRB was. I asked a guy that worked there , and he walked me all the way to it. The CHRB took care of everything in a few minutes.The park itself is very clean, and has a great view of the San Gabriel mountains. It‚Äôs well maintained and landscaped.Getting there is simple. It‚Äôs fright off the 210 Freeway in Arcadia. Parking is easy. You can park in the free lot or pay $5 to go closer to the entrance.There are plenty of totes so you don‚Äôt have to wait long for betting.The quality of the horses is world class. And you are treated to Hall of Fame jocks most days.If you don‚Äôt like racing, you‚Äôll probably not like this place. And if you do, you most likely don‚Äôt need to read about it on TA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MHollman
50,This is the most fun that I have ever had. We love the beautiful mountains and the expensive horses rule.,Try your luck and win a bet. It takes practice to learn to handicap but you can enroll in free classes. One day I plan to claim a horse!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunnyshiines
50,A WONDERFUL Day at the Races,"Our group of five had a fantastic day st Santa Anita Horse Park. It was a light crowd Friday. Both general admission and parking were free. We were hosted by a friend who reserved two tables of six in the Front Runner restaurant. Our location was perfect, with a view of the entire track, overlooking the Jumbotron and the Finish Line. The food was reasonably priced and was perfect. Service from each employee we met throughout the day, approximately 10, were thoughtful, customer experience conscientious and genuinely helpful. We will be back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsieu
50,First time for everything,I have never been to a horse race track before. It was really exciting! They have people help explain how to bet which was great. The food was excellent! We had a private party there so our menu was already picked but all the food going by us off the menu looked really good. Beautiful park! Had fun walking around seeing everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladysteele75
50,Beautiful Day At The Races,"We hosted an event at the Santa Anita Race Park and it was a great time for all! Besides the wonderful food and service, the horses were beautiful to watch and a great way to spend with family and friends. Some areas are adult only but there are also family friendly events and the young adults love the horses. Opening day is December 26 -- we love to take the family while we have a little bit of extra time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail606111

40,Great Way to Spend a Day,"I doubt there is a more attractive setting for a race track in the country. Sitting in the club house, looking out over the track, and seeing the San Gabriel Mountains in the background, makes for a great day. We go a few times a year, sit in the Turf Terrace, enjoy lunch and watch the ponies run.Santa Anita runs specials throughout the racing season. Some are fanciful, others offer the opportunity to taste craft beer and speciality cheese sandwiches.It's a great way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxG583
50,Good food and great entertainment,You can no longer reserve a certain table which I find disagreeable. You have to say that you have at least 4 people coming or you are seated at the smallest table made by man.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/121johnc
40,Fun,A day at Santa Anita is pretty much guaranteed to be a fun day. It's a lovely old building with top-notch contestsnts. It's a lot more fun if you bet on the horses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Fun time at the track.,A day at the races was great fun. I wanted to Surprise my husband by taking him some place he had never been before. The Horse Races was it. It was an awesome day. The day we went it was raining a bit so we went to The FrontRunner restaurant in which every table has a great view of the track.Thw food was very good and the service incredible. We took our time and that was a definite ok in this restaurant. It was immense fun as we took turns placing our bets at the nearby betting stations. Santa Anita is a beautiful track and we can‚Äôt wait to go back on a sunny day and get closer to the horses and the track.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dismaniacjd19
50,A great day,"You can bring the entire family here and nobody will be bored. The grounds are beautiful and expansive so plenty to see and do.

50,Delightful Fun For The Entire Family,"My extended family and I spent an entire day at Santa Anita and had a fabulous time. This was the first time any of us had been to a live horse race and we weren't sure what to expect. Watching the races was very exciting, and we had family wager contest to see who could guess the winner. There are children's activites and plenty of choices to eat. This is also a great place to people watch. The little ones in our group had an opportunity to see the horses up close as well as the jockeys. This is a must do on anyone's list while in Arcadia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynp200
40,Fun Afternoon,If you have an afternoon Santa ANita is a fun place to go with friends or family to take in a day at the races. The track is not as formal as it once was so you can go to the Turf Club and grab lunch in a very casual way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allnines1414
50,Relaxing and Fun,We spent one afternoon at Santa Anita Race Track. First of all the view of the mountains as a backdrop was spectacular. The atmosphere was great and everybody was helpful and really patient. We caught the last 5 races and walked away up on the day. So all round a really fun day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gushcymru

40,Great views,It's a nice track with great views. Easy to park and get in and easy to look at horses before races. Only issue is the beer was very expensive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/show1969
50,Fun at the races!,Just had a ball with friends! Free parking and admission on Thursdays and Fridays. Only $5 a person at the Frontrunner restaurant. Great drinks. Great food. Great fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbadams7
40,Took in the racing from the Clubhouse restaurant.,"We had a table just about at the finish line, about 4 stories up in the restaurant, with comfortable furnishings and perfect views. Admission is charged, and there is a dress code, as befitting the nice tablecloths and napkins, china and solid cutlery. No plastic or paper here. Full bar and eclectic but limited food menu available. Service was good, prices are mid resort. Convenient parimutual windows are close, of course. Each table has its own TV display of the happenings. There are other places for food in the huge facility. The entire park is well landscaped, huge, with lots of parking, but nothing really close for the handicapped. No tram from the parking lot; valet parking is available, but it's still a distance from there to the race viewing areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edq88222
50,Loved it!,"We live in Las Vegas and it was our first visit to Santa Anita. It won't be our last! We had a great time. Track is very pretty and quite historic.

50,"Santa Anita Race Park the Pride of Arcadia, Ca.","A ""Must See"" Race Track when visiting Southern California.Located near the Los Angeles, County Arboretum, especially during the racing season.Some of the most prestigious horse races are held at this venue along with great summer concerts.I am fortunate to live near this beautiful track and have attended the venue many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onthego1936
40,The Great Race Place. Sometimes.,"Since Hollywood Park closed this is really the last old racetrack in L.A. A fun place to be on any Derby Day (Kentucky Derby, Preakness or Belmont). Santa Anita Derby is fun too, especially if a local has a shot at the run for the roses. Definitely sign up for their jockey club card, it's free and easy, gives you some decent discounts and perks. Easiest way to bet if you're new to it is go to a window and buy a voucher, then take the voucher to one of the many machines around. It's way less pressure than having some desperate addict behind you at the window. Beware to get your bets in early because the same thing will happen at the machines as it gets close to post time. Earlier you bet, the chances are you won't be harrassed by some jerk behind you trying to get one more losing bet in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimo213
50,Horse racing,"I like to go to the horse race track, it is a wonderful experience, Santa Anita is a nice track, the people that works there are friendly and helpful. I went there on a Thursday, there was no charge for the parking and the entrance, I just paid for some seats. The track looks very well and the everything there looks nice and clean. For sure I will return to this place which I recommend it to everyone that likes horse racing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mand022
30,Sky View,"I recommend not to buy there sky view package when you go. We spent 140 dollars for two and it was a waist of money. The service, food and seats were horrible. It was a total disaster. They had one waiter for every 20 table on the day we went which was April 7th. It was so dis-organized. Its better to pay general admission to park and have a hot dog or hamburger. That would save you a 100 dollars for betting on the ponies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/689damianw
40,"A ""must see"" place, even if you don't gamble","Beautiful grounds, beautiful horses and there is something for everyone including kids.

50,Went to see my relatives race horse run!,"How lovely is grounds, takes back when racing was an American pass time. Love the big buildings from by gone age. Art Deco or around. We watched our horse get saddled and ready, he was fantastic, the excitement was in air for his second ever race! He got out swiftly and won the race. Th food was excellent for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
40,Great way to spend the day,"The view alone is worth a visit. It is jaw droppingly stunning, seriously.We have lived in Los Angeles for years and I can't believe we haven't come before now. We had a fantastic time just hanging around and enjoying the horses, the fun of betting and the thrill of winning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShesAlwaysWright
30,Gorgeous Views,We've been here a few times and it's a great place to watch the ponies with stunning mountains in the background. A little hard to figure things out if you've never been to a race track before. The general area is bustling with people who leave their ticket losses on the floor. The club area which you pay more for was a little cleaner and nicer. The whole place could really use a make-over though to draw people in. It's very compartmentalized and disjointed. The food options are very limited and pricey. You can go through a tunnel and walk around the inner part of the track which is a nice change from the other areas. We will come back because it's something different from our everyday activities and we love to look at the mountains especially on a gorgeous day. Races are exciting--especially if you pick a winner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63
40,Some things have changed but still a good day out,"Should you like try something a little bit different you cannot go much wrong with a day at the races. The grounds are beautiful the horses tops class. They have changed the arrangements for the inner circle, no more segments with the bar & BBQ for organized parties now it is a first come first serve flummox which is the only bad thing about the track now. But all in all still a good day out. Ample parking, malls & restaurant not too far away",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morfynn
50,Most Scenic track in US,"They don‚Äôt call it the ‚ÄúGreat Race Place‚Äù for nothing. The back drop of Mt Wilson is stunningThey‚Äôre are a lot of different options for seating,dining,etc. If you‚Äôre going to the races on the weekend make reservations,prior to going.You can see the horses train and have breakfast at Clockers Corner daily from 6-10 and there‚Äôs stable area tram tours on the weekends.I suggest calling Santa Anita directly to for more information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyndik779

20,Chandelier Room,"Growing up in Kentucky I love the races! Santa Anita has the most stunning view of the mountains it‚Äôs hard to watch the horses!We paid $70 per person for the Chandelier Room in the Clubhouse. First, it wasn‚Äôt as described in the web site.The Chandelier Room is a large open space that is nice. However, there was a DJ playing loud music and all the seating was couches and chairs. Mind you, this is were the food buffet is located. This made it difficult to eat. The room has seating for about 80 but holds much more. There is no view of the track.The view is up the stairs to a small patio and again, mostly couches. Seating for only about 20.We were fully confused. No one to answer questions. No central manager to assist.Drinks aren‚Äôt included. What you get is a very mediocre buffet and the ability to stand for hours. Skip this. Pay for a box seat or one in the restaurant and enjoy the races at a much lower cost. Get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philr742
50,Equine clover in the sunshine in Southern California,"Equine clover in the sunshine. Hand sliced corned beef sandwiches, the type they made in the 1940‚Äôs. Totally retro, granted nothing has changed since it was built, just cleaning and painting. Beautiful view of the San Gabriel mountains and the observatories on Mount Wilson. Everyone is friendly and the horses are fast, exciting and and beautiful.Easy to bet, easy to lose, just a matter of what horse you select.

There are lots of seating options at different price points, kids get in free, and there's a playground in the infield which is great if your kids are little. We just took our 15-year old for the first time. She loved it as much as we did. It was a beautiful clear day, and the personnel there are totally willing to help if you are new to betting. Take a few bucks, a blanket (if you'll be sitting on a bench), and even your lunch if you like. If not, there are lots of food options onsite.

The place could use a bit of a ""sprucing"" but the setting is beautiful w/ the mountains as a backdrop and palm trees. For the most part the people were incredibly pleasant and went out of their way to be friendly and accomodating (certain security personnel were a bit surly and brusque).All in all a great place to watch horse racing but not nearly as clean or well kept as some places we visit in KY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tencatdaddy

50,Great race place for novices,"This is horse racing at it's best, Santa Anita is one of the top notch race tracks in the country. Updated facility. Plenty of nice restaurants and different ways to enjoy the races. If you want to bring your own chairs and subway sandwich they got you covered general admission. If you want to sit in the club house area enter the clubhouse gate. If you don't want to pay any admission you can go to the infield for free. Let's talk betting they offer any horse bet you can imagine. My favorite is the $1 exacta box. $12 for 4 horses and only two need to come in. They can be in any order. Take the favorite and pick 3 others. The other bet we like is the $5 show your horse can come in 1,2,3 and you get paid. We usually take the 5 and the winning to the next race to see if we can hit every race. Good luck out there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beggem00t

Parking is free and best to enter Gate 3, 5 & 8 to parking lots. Prices for the food vendors are rather high...mostly from $8. to $22 + for lobster items. They open at 4 p.m. and close at 1 a.m. It is quite a happening place and great for everyone. Also, people who are betting on the horse races are there too.You need to have a bit tummy to try everything. I tried a dessert at the Heaven Breath where they offer unique ice cream and a item ""The Artist Palette"" with dipping sauce. It was $10. for a cup of nitro oversize trix cereal and a palate of different dipping sauce. I was disappointed in this as I thought it was nitro ice cream. I do not recommend this at $10.I wish I had more time and tummy room to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluecar88
50,NICE TRACK,This day was my first ever to go since it was on Kentucky Derby day and it was a lot of fun. I had access to all level of floors which was really exciting. The bartenders and staff were all friendly and attentive. I did not have food so I am not able to comment of the menu. This track is nice for a day trip with loads of races to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270julieta
40,HIstory and more history,Awesome place to visit for the architecture and the history. From world war 2 era to modern day racing. Always something to see at Santa Anita,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccunningham333
40,Fun day under the sun,"Santa Anita is an iconic and historical site. It is well maintained. Fun for the racing fan, casual visitor, and the family. Check out Clockers Corner early in the morning for breakfast, watch the horses exercise, and take the stable tour. Kids will enjoy the infield. Several special events are held on weekends throughout the racing season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geneg244

50,Seabiscuit Tram Tour,"Be sure to take the Seabiscuit Tram Tour. You will learn so much about the track, the horses, and racing. It is very enjoyable and informative. On top of that - it is FREE!!!!!The tour guide, Paige, was absolutely marvelous and so knowledgeable. Weekends only. Be at the tram spot at 9:30 to get your seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susangK9032XX
50,Fun with Friends!,"It was a hot day, but we found some shade in the clubhouse seating area, I would say it is worth the extra $. The valet parking was super easy and quick, we had a large party and it was perfect. If you go, you must try the fresh carved sandwiches and visit the Carlos Lounge. The drinks were great and the staff was AMAZING.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kbrown-Ly
40,Fun Experience,We went for the first time during the Belmont so this track was crowded. We paid for the Clubhouse level and enjoyed nice views at the restaurant. The food and service there was top notch!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsK45963
50,"Wonderful Venue, beats Churchill Downs","We attended the Kentucky Derby #139 and the run down facility, which had a sewer flood and ran out of food at 1 p.m. absolutely stunk (we reviewed that at length, what a disappointment). KD at Churchill Downs literally left a hole in our hearts for attending a glamorous race. To the rescue for this terrible experience--Santa Anita Race Park!First the facility is old style glamor (example--the ladies room in the box seat area which was well worth the upgrade BTW--was huge with dressing stations like in the days of old when people dressed up and took an outing seriously. Because it is maintained so well, we got to enjoy the decor and loved the old fixtures and trim everywhere. It added to the experience. The floors were clean, the track seats were clean, the facility had helpful staff, and the food was really good (fresh turkey and roast beef sandwiches with home made chips, yum).And unlike Downs on #139 derby day, we got to be right at the paddock, seeing the horses and jockeys up close and parade past to go to the track.Ample free parking and free entry on Thursday and Friday for grandstand, and $15 for three of us to enter the clubhouse/box area was worth every penny.Santa Anita Race Park gave us the experience we had expected and not received at the Kentucky Derby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tolistravelers
50,Wonderful racetrack in marvelous setting!,Santa Anita is a very nice racetrack in an absolutely wonderful setting! It does show it's age a bit & could use a bit of an update to seating but go! It's large & lovely!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baja001

There are tons of places to explore. Also, do not forget your hat and sunglasses, you will be glad someone tpold you.RG",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207ralphg
50,Nice Park to Stroll Around,"A nice place with flush green park where you can spend your evenings with family & friends. If you are interested in open area fitness then this place is very ideal. There are no major children play area which is a downside and not much of open food stalls, in case you need to munch something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caballero500
30,Hello! Im Mr. Ed,"Great way to spend an hour or two. Free. Entry, High Priced Beers and low wagering make this place a worthwhile visit!

50,Great view and old school,My favorite track in us!!!!!!!!!!! Easy to be close to horses and horsemen. Easy access and great service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkMuleDeerHunter
50,THE GREAT RACE PLACE,"What a beautiful place!! This was my first time here, visiting friends who live close by. The setting is breathtaking looking at the mountains and the races at the same time. I loved that you could get so close to all the horses and see them warming up, whether they are skittish or calm. Walk through the tunnel and let your kids enjoy the playground. The architecture is lovely being built in 1934. A great way to spend a day with your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BH709
50,Fantastic day for racing,"We came here for a business event that our insurance company was hosting in the club house. We had an absolutely fantastic day! The buffet food was so delicious, desserts excellent, and plenty to drink. We were right at track side and able to see everything. My husband went on a tour and was able to go to the paddicks to see the beautiful horses before their race and then was able to go to winners circle after a race. All in all, the Santa Anita Park is a definate place to go to even if you aren't a gambler. Lots of beauty surrounding you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharna1974
50,A Must! Try to Get A Tour!,"First time at the Historic RaceTrack- beautiful- get there as early as you can - Clockers Corner serves breakfast items and you can watch horses warming up- etcTake the Seabiscuit tour if you can to see areas used in filming, the paddock, the walking ring and get a good overview of the timing of the races=Admission varies= Thurs and Fri are Free- less people- plenty of places to sitCheck out their website for special events like Classic Carshows- etc.Great day=food options all over varies- drinks for $4 (sodas/juices) sandwiches-ice cream but beautiful venues-Clean restrooms and mostly helpful employees. Look for Ambassadors with all black and red bow ties- they seem the most knowledgable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BackRoadsUSA
50,Great day outing with three generations,"My MIL told me about the Seabiscuit tour. I did a little research and found that the tour was free to the public, took 45 minutes, and covered the grounds at the park most weekends.We made it to the 9:45 departure time. There was a tram tour and then a question answer session one of the barns. Our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable.Learned a lot however, kids are expected to behave so know that when going. My 9,8, and 4 year old did fine.We came back for the afternoon races and had a ball. Beautiful day at the Park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlwaysExploring17
50,Family Day at the track.,"We took our autistic son here during family day. They have family day in the center of the track with loads of carnival rides and entertainment. About the one thing is they shut down the rides during the races so not to distract the horses. Yet, once a race is done, they rides are right back up and running. Very interesting to see the process. My son won lots of prizes. We had a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yaquigirl
50,Love this place,This is our third time at the track. When we visit our son and wife we enjoy going to the races. We sit in theTerrace Cafe so that it is a mix of outdoors but under the roof. prices are a little high but you get the table for all day so just sit and real;a are not big horse people but enjoy a wager to keep things interesting. You do not have to bet a lot to enjoy an afternoon of racing. I grew up going to race tracks and this is very well kept and the guests are treated well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVJAKE
40,Bucket List Item,"My husband has always want to visit this race track. The grounds were BEAUTIFUL. We went on a Friday and there wasn't much of a crowd at all. Very surprised, Saturday & Sunday must be their big days. We recommend getting the Farriers package. Very good value. Club house entry, box seats, free food and drink. One per ticket. The only down was the poor interaction from employees at the ticket windows. Such unhappy men. No acknowledgement, No thank you, No Good Luck greeting, NOTHING!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dprp2014
50,No better feeling,Love to go to the races. The horses are beautiful. Best carver sandwiches. Barn is really cool. People are friendly we like to go to Annies bar right when we arrive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0bertgailt
50,1st Horse Race Experience & Loved It!,"We went with an educational trip in mind as neither my wife nor I have been to the race track before and we had our two kids with us. Watched a couple YouTube videos, attended the free seminar before the racing started, and after 2.5 hours and multiple small wagers on 4 races we left with $2.20 less in the pocketbook. Visited the Paddock between races to see the horses up close. Great experience and entertainment. Races run about every 30mins. Self service kiosks were intuitive just find the ""manned"" booths for cashing out when you leave. General admission was all we needed and reasonable: free! As was parking: free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1stPassport40
50,What a Treasure!,"This is one of our favorite stops when visiting California. The atmosphere is fun, the seating is very comfortable with multiple types of seating available, and they even have kiosks where you can learn how to bet on the races if you are not familiar with it. There is club house seating available also. The views are outstanding, the food available is good, and the lines are usually pretty short. Just watching the beautiful horses run is worth the trip :) It's a great piece of history you don't want to miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanil2013
50,Beautiful Scenery,I love this track not only for the races but for the beautiful backdrop you get to enjoy in between races.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stacymkc
50,Good day at the races,We purchased clubhouse seats and would recommend them for a relaxed and comfortable day watching the horses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/199MikeH199
40,We Had Fun!,"This track is good. We have only 1 or 2 others to compare it to. The weather this weekend was excellent. We had box seats but found food on the second level to be more appealing. The food on Level 3 with our seats was OK but did not appeal to us. We got a hot dog and it was barely cooked. The second level had all kinds of ""fast food"" and sandwiches. The fries were great and they give you a lot! The area is lovely with a nice view. There was smog, but it was noticeable only in the distance. Drinks at the bar on Level 3 were high priced ($7.50). The sodas and other soft drinks on Level 2 were reasonably priced. Level 2 had so many people there and dozens of betting windows. There was a lot of trash on the floor/ground. I didn't like seeing that. In the box seats, there is no trash container, so it is difficult to keep the area clean. We had great seats and enjoyed the races. Some of the window clerks on Level 3 leave a lot to be desired--very unfriendly and acted irritated when THEY could not understand our bet. They are in a hurry and don't listen. It was fun watching the toss of the horseshoes for someone to maybe win $1,000,000. No one won this year. I like this track as it is only 4 hours from our home in Las Vegas. On Friday, there was no charge for parking, and on Saturday, parking was only $4. I didn't like the fact that they charge you for the program so that you can see which horses are running in each race. I think at Del Mar in San Diego, the program comes with the admission fee. Box seats at Santa Anita are very inexpensive and worth it. Overall, this track is very good. If you've never been to a horse racing track, this is a good one to visit. You can easily drive there from Las Vegas if you are visiting Las Vegas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6755RHsandrag
40,Pretty good afternoon,"The race track overall was clean enough, and the staff we interacted with were very helpful. It isn't anything special, but if you want to spend an afternoon at the races, this isn't a bad place to do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbellc44
50,World Class,"This is a stunning facility...a world-class race track, an art-deco architectural masterpiece, and one of the planet's most beautiful sporting venues. For fans of horse racing, the attraction is obvious, but even if you aren't, there's a lot to recommend it. If you're a fan of art-deco architecture, it's a must-see, and the park-like grounds, especially the paddock/walking ring area, which are almost formal gardens, are a joy to stroll through. And the view of the San Gabriel Mountains from the grandstand is jaw-dropping. Truly, this place is one of Southern California's jewels. If you're in town during racing season (December-July, and for about a month in October-November), do yourself a favor and pay The Great Race Place a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venckman2017
50,Beautiful Track!,"Went here for the Santa Anita Handicap. Beautiful track that faces the mountains and nice amenities on the club level. Club box seats worth it -comfortable and a relaxing place to watch the races.Also, spent an hour at the track in the morning at Clockers Corner. Wonderful to watch the horses working out and got to see Bob Baffert!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/labs33
40,Gorgeous track in a gorgeous spot,"While I cashed only a couple of tickets out of a full day of betting, it was money well spent. This track is spectacular, as beautiful to attend as Keeneland in Kentucky. Be sure to walk the grounds and paddock area. You can get as close as you wish to the horses, jockeys, and trainers, as they prep for each race.The betting windows are easily accessible, as they should be, although it would have been better for more of them to be open on the Sunday we attended.The food and beer selection could have been better; definitely not as good as what you get in Keeneland, but hey...you are there to watch the ponies, not to eat, so who really cares.Very enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveandMolly
40,Great Sunday afternoon,You don't have to wait for the Kentucky Derby to enjoy a day at the racetrack with family and friends. Kids enjoyed it too as we watched the horses get prepped and race. Beautiful surroundings and historic race track.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LibyAH
50,A VERY special place,"Even if you have very little or no interest in one of the best places to enjoy horse racing it is a MUST.If you want lunch in a good resturant with a spectacular view. Go up to the Front Runner. You can make a reservation and pay a cover charge and dine in style, or do as true horse lovers do sit at the bar with no reservation, cover, or minimum and be served the same food and drink by some great bat tenders.And if you are a handicapper, or never put $2.00 on a horse's nose this is the easiest, most friendly place to bet. With many simulcasting screens you can bet on a Santa Anita race or many other tracks in the world.Spend a few hours at this track, and I will make a sure bet. You will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYNorthcoasters
50,Horse racing with a view,Cool old Art Deco grandstand. Many food choices and bars to choose from. Get up close to the horses in the paddock and rub elbows with horse racing elite. The mountains are great backdrop to watch the races.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coopervanning
50,Great experience,We were invited to the track by a good friend. I love horse racing. We went to have lunch at the front runner terrace. Nice meal in good company. The gift shop amazing. I can't wait to come again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juankya
50,First Breeders Cup Race,I had the opportunity to go to the 2015 Breeders Cup. It was awesome and from what I hear I got to go to one of the nicer tracks on the horse racing circuit.Had a great day in the grandstand. The view is awesome and the atmosphere was cool. I would highly recommend going to this track if you have the chance.We also had tickets to enjoy one of the buffet rooms. The food was really good. Great day all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbO8905VU
50,Always a fun outing to the Track,"If you would like to get away from the sea of humanity, ask to be directed to the Clubhouse Terrace for a table that will be yours for the day. They serve lunch and drinks all day. Tricky to find it, but ask for help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaguarford
50,Racetrack brunch,"What better place to have brunch than Santa Anita racetrack clocker's corner restaurant? As a bonus, you're entertained by watching and/or betting the horses as they race around the track with the beautiful backdrop of the snow capped San Gabriel mountains.This is a must see place especially if you have never been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakester1201
50,There 2016 Breeders cup was fantastic.,I went to both days of them Breeders Cup and it was then greatest. Record crowds and top notch horses from around them globe. Nice scenery and the best accommodations for a novice or avid horseplayer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasurbaniak1

50,Beautiful Santa Anita Racetrack...,"I have loved coming here for years and years. I always go up to the clubhouse for lunch now that I'm older, but I use to just stand in the grand stand area. The excitement of the horses racing is always a thrill. The view of the San Gabriel mountains are breath taking. Go out and enjoy a day at the races, and remember to always go for the grey horse... ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriamO7075VV
50,2 days of fun capping 2 weeks of cruising.,"We attended with another couple and had absolutely no regrets. No one won, but not too much was lost. It was a great two days of racing at a quality track. Very nice accommodations and easily accessible. The reservation receptionist makes getting exactly what you want very easy. I would highly recommend using Uber to arrive and depart. It drops you right at the front gate only a few feet from entrance with an easy pickup point. You can choose either nice indoor or nice outdoor table seating or regular box seating. It is an excellent setting for an afternoon of betting on the horses as well as eating, drinking and visiting with friends. We definitely hope to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taxhogsdad
50,Great Day for Horse Racing Photography,"If you like to shoot horse racing photography, this is the place to go. Thursdays and Fridays are free admission and not very crowded, especially the earlier posts. They don't mind you bringing the big pro lenses (I shoot with a Canon 300mm 2.8 on a 5 ds) out there and you can get some fabulous action photos, even right at track level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoronaSt3v3
40,Beautiful track,Opening day is completely overcrowded. Long lines for bets and drinks. We paid an additional $35 for the craft beer vendors. The lines were so long that we were unable to us all of your drink vouchers and the better beers ran out quickly. The remaining beers were not worth drinking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8296RCrebeccam
50,"Historical race track with new, fun events & nightlife festivals.","I've grown up in Arcadia so I'm partial to this historic landmark. This place has so much history, it's amazing that so many of Arcadia's residents have yet to ever step foot inside and experience it for themselves. From Seabiscuit to the Annual Derby held here in April to the days of its interim Japanese interment camp location to a blimp school, the race track is an icon of Southern California and should never be forgotten.There are many different things to do here BESIDES GAMBLING. Do NOT make that your excuse to not visit because you don't like the concept of gambling. Yes, this is a horse track and yes you can gamble here, but there are a plethora of food stalls, restaurants, and bars available to fill up...amazing architecture and history with statues and photos and beautiful gardens... Don't forget about the famous infield! You can walk UNDER the whole track in an old-school tunnel and exit out into the light at the infield(called such because you are literally inside the track's perimeter) and see the grandstands from a view otherwise reserved for the jockeys and horses.The view is amazing. Clear and uninterrupted as far as you can see, only a cross from the Methodist Hospital nearby pushing through some trees can ""technically"" deter it. The San Gabriel Mountains above looking down with a big blue sky, how can you hate being here? It reminds you of the heydays back in the 30s and 40s. The arboretum is right next door so you can see what the vegetation looked like as well.If you're hungry, hit up the turf club or frontrunner restaurants for dinners with a view. There are plenty of old and new-style gambling windows...Graduating from Arcadia High comes with the honor of having the ceremony here, so it's very near and dear to my heart...it also meant I had to take all my Advance Placement and SAT exams here as well... a double-edged sword like no other. But we did get to ditch class and be an extra in Seabiscuit! So 2 pros outweigh my 1 con ;).Parking is $4, hey... they have a LOT of concrete to maintain... don't complain. Entry is usually $5. They give out programs with tips for $2.25 I believe... So for around $12 you can have a fun day at the races... Oh! I forgot they have a playzone for kids in the infield so they can be entertained while the parentals place bids or grab a beer! It's a lovely place to bring relatives, family, kids, and friends on a warm San Gabriel Valley day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hemang88
50,Unique horse racing experience!,"Most people think race tracks are basically the same everywhere. If you were blindfolded and taken to a track . . . iy would be almoist impossible to quickly determine exactly where in the country you were sitting. At Santa Anita, not so much! Santa Anita might just feature the most dramatic scenery backdrop of any race track in America . . . maybe the world! Originally built more than a century ago, the track's history within the sport is amazing so take a few minmutes to ""read up"" before visiting. Seating options and dining are both pleasant. But the special feature is the backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains which feel like they are just past the infield! If you're not sure that you will like horse racing, try a day Santa Anita. The scenery is so spectacular that even if you don't like the sport . . . you'll enjoy the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ourfinan
50,Racing and Cusine,Went for the races and lunch in the Front Runner Restaurant. The food was excellent and the horse racing very exciting. I would highly recommend it for a day of fun. Prices were very reasonable for the meals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steventyre
50,Breeder's Cup races at Santa Anita,"We went for a second time at a real World Cup of racing at Santa Anita. It is located in the luxurious neighborhood of Arcadia. Champion Horses of all over the world visit the US to exhibit beauty and racing capacity. You should buy tickets some 3 or 4 months in advance for this meeting. For regular meetings, it's no necessary, as the race track is really big. There are restaurants, or you can buy food and beverages and bring them to your seat. Santa Anita can be reached by car (large parking) bus or metro (Arcadia Station),and if you need to buy something, is close to a Big mall. Meetings are with daylight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paleteli
40,Arrogate!!!,"Ok so basically the last 3 races were all winners so clearly remembering the best of it. We had the cheapest tickets about 30 dollars I think for the breeders cup. All in all the course is fantastic, the view is amazing and a great day's racing.One downside is the staff were quite rude, buying food (which isn't cheap) they were rude, taking bets majority were rude. I understand it was busy and probably busiest meeting of the year but a bit more manners wouldn't have gone amiss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
40,Breeders Cup,"This was a special trip to the USA to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and the Breeders Cup has long been an ambition. We also love the film Seabiscuit so what better way to combine both by seeing the Breeders Cup at Santa Anita- Seabiscuit's home.We attended on both days. On Friday we pushed the boat out, did the fine dining on the Belmont Terrace with reserved seats in the grandstand. To be honest for $150 the dining experience was a disappointment, the food was a distinctly average buffet.The seats were great though and Santa Anita is a stunningly beautiful track.Very little waiting in queues to put bets on but the price of drinks was expensive. To get a pint of beer you have to ask for a ""giant beer"" and it was $12 Wow! For this Northern bird who is horrified by London prices that was steep. A small beer, that was probably 3/4 of a pint, was $8.On Saturday we were on the course. Again blown away by the beauty of the track but surprised by the lack of food outlets for those not doing any kind of organised dining. I stood in a queue for 40 minutes to get a ham sandwich. Not great.(I have to compare this to a busy day at York races where there are pretty much wall to wall mobile food outlets) The betting was better - again no waiting to put bets on.Overall as an experience it was fabulous, we saw California Chrome's last race, saw Seabiscuit's statue and would love to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaa29
50,Incredible Breeders Cup!,"Lovely place, beautiful and very kind people! They were organized and ready for a large crowd as there was never a wait for food, beverage or in the restrooms. A lot of history and pride here and it definitely showed. Congratulations to a lot of work that was very well done - it looked beautiful, especially in the paddock area. I would definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnyl216
40,Nice Track-Food Not That Great,"I hadn't been to a horse rack track in many years until I visited Santa Anita. Things have changed. The betting was done on machines and it didn't take long to get the hang of them and figure out how to do it. No real lines as it wasn't busy the day I went even though admission was free. Bought a hot dog and tea at the snack bar. The tea tasted horrible, not like tea at all. They had the place looking real nice because the Breeder's Cup was the next couple days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
50,One of the top tracks in the country for racing fans,"Time stands still when inside a racetrack -- not too much has changed inside for more than forty years --- anyway, great place to visit, top quality racing, nice gift shop, food choices decent. Paddock and walking ring unmatched, A+ for a racetrack",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stormyray
50,Take a note uk,Visited for the breeders cup. Even though the crowd was big I never once had to wait for toilets good or drink. Never felt overcrowded and watched from seat and rails. Uks greedy r acecourses should take note. Only downside was chaos and lack of staff knowledge when leaving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cssoperator
40,"2016 Breeders Cup, California Chromes last race, amazing time!","I got to see #californiachrome 's last race and it was a heart stopper! Santa Anita is a great track and it was a great experience all around. There were some complaints about service etc, they had over 72,000 people and was very comfortable. I will be back next season!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dany92118
50,And They're Off!!!,"I had the pleasure of attending the Breeders Cup on Saturday, Nov 5 at the Santa Anita Race Track. It was AMAZING! So many people dressed up in suits, dresses, fascinators and hats! It was definitely a fun and exciting location. Nestled in the foot hills of the San Bernardino mountains near Los Angeles, the Santa Anita Race Track is a gorgeous sprawling complex. It has three tracks and a huge in field that you can access via underground tunnels. Ample parking is available around the track and you can be picked up via tram to the front gate. Unfortunately, they don't sell premium cocktails at the bars, just well drinks. There were a few lunch trucks that were stationed in the in-field as well as a mini concert! Bet on a couple horses, sit in the shade and cheer for the jockeys! It can't get any better than this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theJasonTadeoShow

50,Another great Breeders Cup,This was another great year for the Breeders Cup. I will only attend these great races when they are held here. It has great parking and is a large enough facility to accommodate the LARGE crowds that want to see these races live. I will be back when they host again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddtburg
30,Nice track but not prepared for large crowds such as breeders cup,"Beautiful setting looking at mountains and excited for breeders cup. Buying any food or drink was a minimum 30 minute wait. Ran out of sandwiches, water and beer at concession stands I waited in. Took my sister in law 45 minutes to get hot dog. Had to get water from ice tub at concession where they served wine. Over 70,000 people all leaving after watching California chrome and no traffic control. Total chaos driving through city streets. Sound system vintage in a bad way. Could not understand anything and music performers a waste. Video monitors small and can not be seen from grandstands. Ok to visit on slow weekend to see beautiful track but don't go on busy weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikehC9437RO
40,Race track is kid-friendly,Often attended this beautiful race track for birthday celebrations or just a pleasant day out. The track rents out covered patios for small events and you can get catered food and snacks and they'll also supply a bar right there. The track has a very large and kid-friendly infield where the kids can play on acres of grass and a playground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcdennis2014

50,Breakfast,The biggest secret in Arcadia is the wonderful breakfast served at Clockers Corner in Santa Anita Race Track. Open 5:30 to 10 food is home cooked and everyday they have a different homemade soup which you can't beat anywhere. You sit outside and enjoy the day eating breakfast while watching the horses work out. Whenever I have company that is always on their list to go to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbniswan
50,Great to sit in the clubhouse seats looking at the mountains,Spent a pleasant afternoon visiting this beautiful race track on a pleasant sunny afternoon.Sit at the base of a beautiful mountain range. What better sight then to view races in this setting.The only problem that we encountered was trying to win a bet as well as the painters convention that was being held directly behind the betting windows.Missed a few races due to crowds too close to the windows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GARYW478
50,Close to the horse raceÔºÅ,It's nice to be there when there are horse racing. You can watch the race closely. Sometimes you can even ride pony! Also a place for picnic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDONG-coh

50,Fun day,"What a fun way to spend the day. When you drive up to the race track,it looks like a beautiful and elegant place from the past. While watching the races the beautiful mountains are in the background. The restaurant has excellent food. I had a turkey BLT on pretzel bread. It was very fresh and the turkey was delicious. The waiter was friendly and attentive. You can even watch the horses and jockeys up close when they are on their way to the track for their race. The experience was a great way to spend the day with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karen1012
50,If you like racing...,"If you enjoy horse racing, it gets no better (at least in California) than Santa Anita (the ""Great Race Place."") The beautiful background of the San Gabriel mountains cannot be matched by any other racetrack that I am aware of. This is THE race track in California. Nothing else comes close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jandh33089
50,Another Check Off the Bucket List,"If you love horse racing and its history you have to visit this mecca. The beauty of the San Gabriel mountain range in the background, Bob Baffert holding court, TVG onsite, are some of the reasons to come and visit. Loved my time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/appetitetogo
50,A great place for horse racing history.,"I noticed that the attached photo is of the 2010 horse of the year ""Zenyatta"". The Bronze is beautiful with it's painted white socks, but for me it is seeing the bronze statue of ""Seabiscuit"" that is so appealing. To think this was the horse that beat the famous, East coast champion, ""War Admiral"" in 1938 to become the Horse of the year. I was two years old at the time & now I am standing besides his statue at the age of eighty. I have visited, over the years, a number of times to Santa Anita during the racing season, but now free from the crowds I was up close & personal with a piece of history. Strange as it may seem I am not a gambler but I do love horses that is why I am here at Santa Anita in Sept. So if you take the time to visit this special place, to gamble or just to say you have been here, be sure to visit these historic bronzes of famous horses that graced the turf, & some many years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheriffGunn
50,Outstanding Venue to Experience Quality Thoroughbred Racing,"Quite possibly the best all-around Horse Racing venue in the United States. Have been to numerous other tracks around the country, but this has the widest variety of amenities and accommodations for both the novice as well as for the professional handicapper. Spent two wonderful days watching high quality fields; lunch at the Terrace Club was very good. Del Mar is wonderful, but the shear size and scope of Santa Anita's offerings puts it a neck ahead at the finish line!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimeTraveler_800
40,Historic - worth a visit,"We do not bet horses nor gamble but the race park is certainly well-worth the visit. Especially notable is the architecture of the building, the history of the track, which includes Seabiscuit, and the gorgeous view of the San Gabriel Mountains as a backdrop across the track. Free admission and most of the seating area is open. Day we attended no race only betting on races elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaY9891

40,Off to the Races,Santa Anita race track is one of the few tracks left in SoCal since the closing of Hollywood Park. It is a destination track for many of the major races. My friend owns horses so we are always pleased to attend when his horses run. The track is set in the Los Angeles backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains. Betting is efficient and hospitality easily accessible. On special occasions souvenirs are complimentary. Nearby is Arcadia Westfield Mall with plenty of stores and restaurants. Attending races at Santa Anita is a wonderful way to experience southern California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpac2
40,Foodie Fest,We had a lovely experience at the Santa Anita Race Park. We were in town August of last year during the 616 Fest. It was a massive food truck festival with countless vendors and plenty of shopping. It was super busy FYI.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872emilye
50,Absolutely beautiful facility/ wonderful outside afternoon,"We love to come to Santa Anita Track -- as it is such an always dressed for the public Southern California experience. We always say we should come back more often.And with its rarely full stands-- worry that it will not be there forever-- like it should be, if they keep it in the condition it is now. Fun to go back and see the horses at the paddock.If you have not been/ have not for a while DO NOT MISS IT!! You will look hard and long for a more beautiful view of mountains, greenery, the sport of kings and downright afternoon joy. Ie Southern CA at its best!!

From the food trucks to the BBQ, to the micro brew days in the infield there is so much to do other than play the ponies and that's always a blast as well. Great places to eat, drink and be seen! I highly recommend the Great Race Place for a days outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicolaP2222

50,23 years between visits,"I hadn't been here for a long time.maybe I was jaded because I've been to Saratoga every year for 8 yes now but it seemed like not much was different at the ""great race place"".maybe it has some new paint and some private boxes and gas gone through three track surface changes. Now dirt again I believe?but I was not in awe .even with a kids carnival in the infield and one foliar draft and hot dog day, it just seemed ok.people were very friendly and I spoke with many of the staff who all knew Windsor Ontario Canada, and had relatives etc in Canada. I wondered if without the memorial day holiday and the thousands of kids for the carnival and the thousands of non horse fans there for the cheap draft, how many would've been there normally? I guess the fact I never win there hurts my.opinion?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zeeguide

We love to have lunch in the Frontrunner Restaurant, very good food great views, and last week the weather was so pretty with the Mountains in the backdrop.

You don't have to be a knowledgeable horse person to have fun there. We usually sit on the in-field on the grass, it's relaxing and I actually end up getting all excited when the horses come out and do their races! There's food and drinks available, and the vibe is very chill and fun. With the mountains as a backdrop, this venue is a nice place to come to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
30,A Day of Fun,"I have gone here twice this year and have really enjoyed the day. Have not been to a race track for about 30 years and husband has never been. First visit we went for the chili cookoff. The chili was just OK but the race track was fun. So much fun that we brought our son and his girlfriend this visit for the Tacos n Beer event. We all lost money and made money but it was great entertainment. You can bring in your own lunch if you want, families are welcome and parking is only $4.00. General admission $5.00, how can you go wrong. The view is amazing of the hills. This place is old, but clean and there is always some event going. It is worth checking into.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redbeauty58
50,Fun place to watch Kentucky Derby!,"First time to the racetrack and we decided a good time to go would be when they'd be showing the Kentucky Derby on their big screens. Got to bet on the local races, as well as the Derby. Had a fabulous afternoon. parking was easy in/out and only $4. We paid for access to The Gallop Out. Get there early if you want a seat at the windows overlooking the track. We got there around 10:30 and got the last seats at the windows. The Buffett was marginal, but the bartenders were great. Overall great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaleG880

I've also been for concerts and for events, which are easily handled by the open and well kept grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MithilaNepal
50,Fun even if you don't know horses,"I'm not a gambler and I can't handicap a horse. So why did I go to Santa Anita Race Park? There was a special event, a Chili Cook-Off! My husband and I went for the chili and were pleasantly surprised by everything else that we experienced.First and foremost is this iconic park. It is fabulous and they have maintained it in such a way that it is in Disneyland condition. The structures and grounds are beautiful. We sat in the Club House and our seats were perfect. I was blown away by how beautiful the track is, once again, perfectly maintained.This started off with us enjoying chili along the apron on the west side. That was enough fun in itself with many cooks preparing their chili on the spot and our ability to try 8 different small cups of chili. By the time we finished I was filled but not too much to enjoy the wine that came along with our Cook-Off package (my husband had beer). I don't know who won the competition but I'm glad I didn't need to judge!Then it was to our seats and watching the races. Our seats allowed us to see the owners boxes and the winners circle. I am not a gambler but did put money on a couple of races --of course I lost but it was worth it for the fun.There is a large parking lot and I can imagine it is quite a walk if it is crowded and you get there later than we did.Will we do this again? Yes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2

But not horse racing where you can bet, as gambling in all forms is illegal.So on vacation, i met up with friends who invited me to the Japan Fest. There were food booths and such. But what there was was horse racing! Even if you know nothing(like myself), you can easily learn about horse betting. They have booths that explain it to you. Then, go to one of the many booths to place your bet and watch! There were about 9 matches that day. I played the 1st 2 and actually won the 2nd one! If only I bet more than $2.00.

The view from the stands is wonderful with the track in front and the mountains in the background. Top quality racing in a great venue makes for a fun afternoon. We ended up down $12 so with admission, racing form and some food the total cost was less than 40 for 5 hours of entertainment for the two of us. Now that is hard to beat.If you are a first timer make sure you speak to the racing ambassadors and they will help you out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonJac
40,Recently reopened in Sierra Madre,"Zugos Caf√©, Sierra MadreLinen napkins, sparkling glasses, friendly staff at the reopened Zugos on Sierra Madre Blvd. Manager/owner Rickey is hands on and can be found even in the kitchen but usually schmoozing with patrons. Speaking of customers, I note that the lunch service is consistently big. This portends well for the future. The community seems to be embracing this little place. The menu still needs help especially in the pasta department. The wine selection is good.Looking at the Zugo website, the headline appears to be the ‚ÄúFrench chef‚Äù. So far, the French chef seems to be a no show and the only French item on the menu is steak frits. Maybe Z should stick with Italian since the one good Italian place in Sierra Madre (Sierra Brigante) is closing. The current chef, not from the south France but south of the Rio Grande seems to be doing a great job.Although management seems to be waiting to see which way the wind is blowing, the new Zugos is off to a good start.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayo1234

50,Dining with a view at the racetrack,"Had lunch this past Monday at Santa Anita Racetrack's Turf Terrace Restaurant. The food (I had the lobster roll, served with French fries that weren't half bad) was fine, the service decidedly friendly.What was special was the view of the races. We were virtually on the finish line, three levels above the track, with a perfect view of every finish. And with four winners, I especially enjoyed the great sight line.There's an extra charge to get into the clubhouse, where the Terrace is located, and the dress code requires that blue jeans be ""nice,"" whatever that might mean, and collarless shirts are discouraged. But for a slight extra cost and a slightly less grungy look, you're rewarded with a view that is unparalleled. Once again, Santa Anita scores a resounding 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6450TNmarks

50,A relaxing day at the races...,"I took some out of town visitors here and we had a wonderful time. I had bought a box for 4 people although you don't need to do that if you go on a weekday, apparently, because there were plenty of empty seats during the afternoon and we could have sat in regular seats with lots of room around us. Our Farrier box package included an entree from one of the concession stands, a free drink, and souvenir beer glasses. We learned how to bet from very helpful tellers (if that's what they are called) at the counter, and had a lot of fun losing as well as winning now and then. The view is spectacular from any vantage point, and we enjoyed walking down to see where the horses are shown before they go out on to the track. There are many gathering spots and choices of places to eat and drink. The website of Santa Anita instructs how to place a bet, and the basics, for first -timers, which we studied on the way over in the car. Great way to entertain your visitors, we hung out there for several hours. The food was excellent, especially the sandwich concession with generous portions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3855POhelena

The jockeys were interesting as well. The people we met in the stands were nice and added to our fun. The people in the booths where we placed our bets were also helpful.We won't go every week or even once a month, but it's fun to go on occasion and this track certainly is worth going to if you are in the area. From all we could see it is a really well kept place with with great view of the mountains.All tolled for a couple hours of fun and 4 races we spent $50 since entry to the park was free. You can easily spend more or even less if you just want to watch the ponies race.I am happy to recommend Santa Anita Race Track for some good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schnedavid
50,"Terrific experience, even for first time visitors","This was our first time ever visiting a horse racing venue, and we could not have been more impressed with this experience. The view of the mountains is uncluttered, and postcard perfect. The facility is beautiful, and has been maintained and updated to provide a perfect combination of modern function and comfort without losing the historic beauty of the original design. Every staff member we encountered was welcoming, helpful, and very patient with our first-timer lack of knowledge. All of the seating areas looked great, but we specifically asked for the ""nicest outside seating experience"", and were guided to the Turf Terrace (a deal at $10). This was a perfect location, and the service and food was impeccable, at reasonable prices. Wagering minimums are low enough you can try your luck without much worry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/922susanf922

Opening day for the first session was special. Early risers can experience horse and trainer sessions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grandmud1

40,Morning workout at Clockers Corners,"This is one of the prettiest places, early in the morning. They have close free parking, and you can buy a modest breakfast and sit at Clocker's Corners and watch the morning workouts. I didn't give them five stars because I didn't like the coffee, but you can bring your own. The track has a free tram that take you through the barns and other parts of the track. Thursday and Friday are free parking and free general admission for the afternoon races. The racetrack sits looking up at the San Gabriel Mountains and is just off the 210 Frwy. on Baldwin. It is across Baldwin from the LA County Arboretum and next to the Westfield Santa Anita shopping mall. I went on October 25 and saw American Pharoah on the track, a special experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
40,Nice Place to horse around,"Santa Anita Race Park is fun, great for kids, and has a warm and friendly atmosphere. It is great to watch the races, just for the fun and excitement of it.

50,Go for the 6:30 a.m. wokouts.,"I had heard about watching the workouts, but it was more thrilling than I even imagined, especially with American Pharoah there preparing for the Breeders' Cup, and other great horses as well. The energy was just so special - so many horses working out and the people watching in silence just filled with love for the sport. There is almost a reverence there with the sun coming up and the mountains covered in fog. Really neat!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susangK9032XX
50,we went to a car show here & I got to watch the races to boot!,I have loved Thoroughbreds and the Santa Anita Track since I can remember. I have owned 2 OTTB's so imagine my surprise when we were on vacation and found out there was a car show at the track where I have always wanted to go. I got to see my first horse races after 35 years of loving the sport and it did not disappoint. The staff here were wonderful and very helpful. I cannot wait to come back here again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
20,Disappointing,"My husband and I stopped here while on our honeymoon in California since he is a huge horseracing fan. I have to say this place was a disappointment. You had to pay just to park then again to walk in the door. I've never been to a racetrack that charged for either of those before. While he was waiting for one of the races to start, I decided I wanted to go get a frozen drink. The main bar didn't have any, so I was directed to the Fieldhouse. After finally finding it, I was asked if I was stamped. I said yes, my hand was stamped when I paid to get in. The hostess held my hand under the black light and proceeded to tell me I wasn't ""priviledged"" to be in there because I didn't have the right stamp. Ok fine, slightly embarrassing in front of a line of people, but I didn't know you had to pay extra to go in there. I decided to make my way down to the Rita Cabana near the track to get a strawberita (I am not really into the racing, so I was just trying to paas the time). I was then told they didn't have any of any flavor - just regular beer. What's the point of the stand and the big signs on it with all the flavors listed??? My husband enjoyed a few races, but we both agree that it won't be on our list of stops next time. It was a nice looking place, but definitely could be run better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amya631
50,Great day outdoors,"This is a fun place to visit to watch races, get some food and enjoy the great California sunshine! They often have concerts and food/drink specials and giveaways but it's fun on normal days. Expect to spend at least a few hours here to explore the grounds, watch the horses parade before their race and place a bet or two. All reasonably priced fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/childofcorn
50,Great time had by all,First time to a racetrack in the US and it was fantastic. Dropped off at the gate by Uber and we were greeted by the Manager. He walked us up to the pay gate and upgraded us to VIP. Found the track and building charming and old school set in stunning surroundings. We planned to stay for only a couple races but ended up staying all day! Everyone helpful and friendly....fun day had by all. Really helpful that there is an Uber pick up and drop off area which is clearly signposted for drivers and passengers too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillyDundee
50,Father and Son Day Out,"There usually is a fee for entrance but we went on a Thursday free admission and free parking day. Had a nice relaxing day out with my son eating hot dogs, let him pick a few ponies and sat there spending a wonderful day out. The staff is super friendly especially to kids. I didn't know you are allowed to bring a small cooler otherwise I would have packed some extra treats for him. I can't wait to take him back for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411

Not bad at all~It is always fun to see any sports LIVE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
40,Remembrance of days gone by,Went to a concert at Santa Anita Park. The Race track is a beautiful remembrance of days gone by. When you come through the front gates you will think you should be getting dressed up for the Kentucky Derby!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancesG_12
50,Arguably the best racetrack in America,"I've been to Santa Anita literally hundreds of times, and I've been to a good many other tracks, in California, the rest of the country, and abroad. I'll take Santa Anita over all of them. Santa Anita has the best sight lines and draws the best horses (three consecutive Breeders' Cups and five in the past seven years confirm that the horsemen love it there). There's no more beautiful backdrop for racing (well, maybe the chateau at Chantilly) than what race caller Joe Hernandez used to call ""the majestic San Gabriel Mountains."" Access to the horses in the saddling enclosure and the walking ring is excellent, and you can get close enough to the jockeys on their way to the walking ring to encourage or insult them, depending on how you're feeling about their ride in the previous race.Attendance at Santa Anita isn't what it once was, not with racing televised on TVG and other racing-related channels, and not with gambling via computer available in many states. I'll admit that the smaller crowds produce a less exciting ambiance. But Santa Anita is still the total package. If there's a better racetrack anywhere, I have yet to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6450TNmarks

I guess you can call me a regular at this place. You can dress up or go beach casual, it doesn't matter. You can live it up in the fancy restaurant upstairs or eat a hot dog and sit on a bench. I enjoy pretty much everything about this place. Make sure you join the Thoroughbred Club because the more you go, the more you will save. You will get coupons for free entry if you sign up as a member. This can include entrance, parking, etc. Take the Seabiscuit tram to see behind the scenes. They have made many beautiful improvements too. The bar upstairs is beautiful! Go to the infield with your kids and enjoy the outdoors. There is always something for everybody!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomjonesCalifornia

50,Cant beat a day at the races!,"One of the most beautiful race tracks in U.S. i love the turf racing off of the hill, plenty of betting windows just find an area that doesn't have a lot of newbies and you'll be fine. Food is usually pretty good although there are not a lot of different spots so they do get a little crowded. If you are going on a big race day, get there early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd46
40,Class horse racing,Huge facility with spectacular views. Many food choices from waiter service to fast food. More than ample pay parking including valet.The downside is that horse racing has not adapted to the present. Half hour between races. Not much to do other than read the racing form and pick your horse.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalTraveler91356
50,Triple Crown Winner,"I purchased a trackside package for $15 that entitled me to a seat in a roped off area of near the track, a free alcoholic drink, a baseball cap, and a tip sheet from a handicapper. Besides all the races, we got to see the Triple Crown winner American Pharaoh parade by his admiring public. What a deal and great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460paulinec
50,Box Seats are worth it!,"We have gone to Santa Anita to see the Jockey club Gold cup for the past two years. Both times it has been a great day. There are children's activities in the infield. The playground is free, but some of the other activities (Face painting, bouncy houses) have an extra cost.We had fun watching the horses get saddled and then going and placing our bets and watching the races. The food in the section where the box seats are is pretty good. Also in the boxes there are TVs, so you can watch other sporting events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCKelsey
50,"beautiful track and great ""seabiscuit"" tour","I went here because I am a horselover and fan of American Pharoah( now triple crown winner!!)I went on the ""Seabiscuit tour"" of the stables and behind the scenes life at the track and was not disappointed at all. I did have a very difficult time using the online phone numbers that were listed to book the tour, these did not connect me with anyone that I could talk to on the day that i called. I did call on the same morning as the tour, and so i just went to the track and hoped I could join the tour.When i got to the track, I saw one sign that pointed in one direction, for parking for the tour, and then no other signs. It was very difficult to find out where to go, but I did manage to find the tour tram just as it was pulling away, and the tour was well worth the effort!So... try to call ahead, and leave a good 30 minutes of advance time at the track to park and find the tour!The tour was fantastic! saw many barns and some of the staff housing, the pre race barn, the jockey's dressing room, saddles and the saddling area. then a complimentary pass to go into the grandstands.I then had a wonderful lunch at the Frontrunner restaurant. Had to pay an extra $5 for privilage of being there, but it was well worth it. The veiw, the staff, and the food were all well worth it!It is a beautiful racetrack, palm trees, mountains, statues of great horses...I am not a gambler, so only watched 4 races, then went home, but had a wonderful time!Definitely a fun place to spend a morning and part of, or the whole the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhodeygem
50,WHAT A GREAT DAY,Santa Anita Race Park is a wonderful place to spend the day and is by far the best racetrack I have ever been to. The race park is well maintained and well run. The mountains in the background made it even more pleasant. The employees are extremely nice . The park is huge with so many different ways/places to watch the races. Lots of grassy areas to have a picnic and noticed that people were bringing in their own water and snacks. How great is it that they allow you to bring food in. General admission is just $5.00pp and parking is $4.00. I felt the prices for food and drink to be quite reasonable. We had an even more special day as American Pharaoh made an appearance after the 7th race. Great day...we will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7066VSlisas
50,Place a Bet!,I love going to the infield. If you have children please go to the play area in the infield for the kid. I also enjoyed viewing the horses before they ran.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilnLA
50,Terrific fun and a day at the races,"Having grown up in Southern California i have passed by Santa Anita countless times. Finally I set a side a day to go to the races. I anticipated a relic of a building as it was older than I am. Boy was I wrong. It's clean and well maintained. Food and parking is cheaper than Dodger Stadium. Plus the employees are gracious and appear to enjoy their jobs. All a positive plus.For a newbie track racing and betting was an interesting experience. I was a low roller, $2.00 bet on each race. At the end of the day I was only down $10.00 as I won two races.It.s fun to watch the horses in the stables. Lean and fast, not like the rental horses in Griffith Park.After the 3rd race we had lunch at the Turf Club. Service was great and the short rib sandwich was among the best I have ever had. we were able to remain at our table that was located on the finish line for the rest of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Fun for the family,"My wife and I attended a work event held at the historic race track. Our organization reserved the picnic area on the infield portion of the track, but had access to everywhere. The food was delicious and beverages were flowing. Our group was given tours of the park and paddock as well as betting advice by a former jockey.I have been to the track many times, and it is always a good time. The price is easiliy manageable even for a family. The racing is an entertaining backdrop for your picnic. There are some attractions for the kiddies as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyD342

50,"Unique building, a great experience even if you don't bet on horses","The tram tour is very interesting and the grounds are beautiful. If you see any of the horses they are all so gorgeous.

50,"Great Thoroughbred Races, and Seabiscuit Tour!","If you want to add a little fun and behind the scenes action at the track, get there early to enjoy the FREE Seabiscuit tour that happens during the morning workouts. The tram portion takes you through the barn area, past the barn where Seabiscuit lived, and the walking portion brings you around the race staging areas as well as the statues around the grounds. A lot of interesting information about the history of Santa Anita. The guides are horse trainers/owners and at the end, we actually got to ""meet"" a couple of her horses who are stabled at Santa Anita. As we were boarding our tram, we also got to say hello to HOF jockey Gary Stevens who was watching workouts (and who was in the movie ""Seabiscuit"" - pretty cool!). Food in the clubhouse was good and service was relatively quick.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneW342

50,Fantastic race track,"Coming from Australia where we think our tracks are pretty good, the view from this one was exemplary. We paid extra for a Farriers package which got us into a box with a TV, free meal and 1 free drink, as well as race book and a gift at the shop at the end. We are avid race fans in Australia and absolutely loved our day at the track. Very interesting to see them race on dirt and turf at the one meeting. We eventually worked out dividends were for a $2 bet, not $1 like here in oz. if you ever get the chance, come to this track, it was sensational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madnesss
50,Great Day of fun outdoors at the track,"What a great day of fun. It was wonderful to be outdoors and the track was beautiful. I've always wanted to go to a horse race and never thought it was affordable. I was wrong. This is a really inexpensive fun day. We were able to even place inexpensive bets on each race to make it more fun and exciting. You could though, pack a cooler and bring in your own food and drinks. The food trucks there were delicious. We can't wait to go back this time and bring the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1ofR4

40,Special place to watch the ponies,"The ambiance and setting of Santa Anita is truly unique and very special. The backgrounds of the Sierra Madre Mountains gives the track, both dirt and turf a surreal visual. Also, the turf sprint course down the hill is one of a kind in the USA and a treat. Frontrunner restaurant service is excellent but menu a little pricey for what you get and you can not get any potato chips which would be nice with some of the sandwiches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8029ZYjohnb
50,Top Best tracks in the world!,"Take a date, or the family. See the horses up close.

50,Beautiful Venue,"I took my mother to Santa Anita for lunch and a Friday afternoon at the race track. The clubhouse has to be one of the best values around. Admission was $5 more than the regular admission. We were seated and we enjoyed salads, a ruben sandwich and the magnificent view of the San Gabriel Mountains as a backdrop to the finest racing facility in the country. The staff was very helpful and we spent most of the afternoon in those seats enjoying the races and dessert.

50,Derby Day,"Santa Anita Race Park is an institution and even if you don't like racing the scenery is worth it. With mountains all around and topiary, it harkens back to when racing was the sport of kings. We went on Derby Day when the winner of the 8th race goes to the Kentucky Derby. I went with the Alumni association from my old high school. We were in the picnic oval in the middle of the track. Most people who go are in the grandstands. Lovely day to see the ponies run. The oval is very commercial with beer festivals and food trucks while the stands have a quieter feel and a clubhouse. This year they had replays of famous races over the loudspeaker between real races and that was confusing. A fun day for all ages as they have many entertainments all over the park. Bring your own food or buy from many choices. Be sure and bring a hat and sunscreen if you plan to walk around as it gets hot in the walkways. Visit the paddock area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
50,We Love This Track!,"After reading TA reviews on Santa Anita we decided to give it a try. It's about two hours from our Palm Springs resort so we made a day of it.This is a beautiful track with incredible landscaping. We were oo-ing and ahh-ing we walked in. It's simply gorgeous! Based upon previous reviews, we paid the extra $5 for Club admission and headed there.On the way to the Club area we stopped and checked out the general admission area. There is definitely nothing wrong with the general admission areas with plenty of room to watch the races and lots of food choice.The Club areas are more upscale and they have better seating. Most of all, you get admission to the Terrace restaurant where you can get a table over looking the finish line and with an incredible view of the entire track. It's simply awesome! We had lunch up there and had one of the best track experiences we've ever had!We can't wait to come back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNM1011

Probably dumb luck but it never hurts to check out the horse you are betting on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeenThereDoneThat123
50,There is something for everyone. A first class operation.,"Santa Anita just seems to get better with age. The racing season is much longer since Hollywood Park closed, and even though Los Alamitos has been upgraded to a full mile track and has taken over some racing days it has just made Santa Anita seem even more special. We usually sit in the Turf Terrace for drinks and lunch; food and drinks are reasonable considering the view of the track, and not having to pay any other premiums for seating other than the price of clubhouse admission. Many families make a day of it picnicking the infield, where more serious bettors hang out in one of the bars, or in a box seat. Track personnel are very friendly and even most patrons will be more than happy to help novices figure out how to make a bet. The historic grandstand and track, backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains, and cleanliness make this a great place for an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Qualnurse

Beautiful landscaping, many great sculptures of famous horses and track celebrities and of course some of the best horses in the country. The San Gabriel mountains provide a beautiful backdrop to the track as an added bonus. The track is well maintained in all areas and you are safe and comfortable at all times. No better way to spend an afternoon and you might come out of there with more money than you had when you went in. Three cheers for one lovely racing venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55georger

It has been kept up to date but retains its historical presense, making it a must visit for anyone wishing to enjoy a day at the races as it once was, or almost.The setting against the San Gabrial Mts is spectacular and the racing is as good as any in America. Weather is usually good with a chance of rain in the winter but still even then there are places to hide under the grandstand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alcduane
50,A MUST SEE,"One of the nicest racetracks in the country. Beautifully manicured grass, bushes and trees it is worth a throughout the complex. Beers and food are not cheap but it is worth a day to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phillytom_10
50,Breeders' Cup 2014,"Traveled all the way from NY to attend the 2014 Breeders' Cup - everything here was first class. This is the best race track that I have been to, and I think you'll be hard pressed to find a better backdrop than the San Gabriel Mountains. If you are a racing fan, Santa Anita is a must and trust me, it is worth the cross-country flight for those on the East Coast. Looking forward to heading back when Santa Anita hosts the 2016 Breeders Cup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bluescreen2
50,Santa Anita is one of the best places to watch horse racing,"SA is a wonderful place to watch races. I've been to the Breeder's Cup when they've hosted (in 2009, 2013 and 2014) and will go back when they host again next year in 2016. They host a lot of stakes races and top notch horses run there, so you can always see the superstars (I watched California Chrome and Shared Belief race last weekend, and you won't find a better matchup!) The concessions are good, I am a novice bettor - the people who run the betting windows are always great when I have questions about how something works. The seating is ALL good. You get good views no matter where you sit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karlyndab
50,One of the most beautiful Race parks in the world,"We had our Rotary meeting there this morning and were lucky enough to get a talk from one of the jockeys who rides there. He has ridden at tracks around the world and he said Santa Anita is one of the best 3 or 4 in the world. And he's ridden Dubai, England, all over the world. It is so beautiful and the staff are the friendliest ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR71
50,The place is magical,"This place has a magical feeling as soon as you walk into the place. Imagine the 20 ' s here, dressed up in your Sundays best. Walking to the paddock and seeing the jockeys mount the horses. Making bets on a gut instinct because you like the name of the horse or the color or the way the jockey looked at you! Either way you feel that rush as the horses approach the starting gate! You place your bet and close your eyes and imagine the possibilities with your winnings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metalmulisha88
50,a fantastic day out,you can get into the races for as little as 5 dollars and have a fantastic time spending ...or winning as much as you like ...the latter requiring a bit of luck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patfatty
50,Breeders Cup 2014,"Had visited Santa Anita Racetrack on closing day, June 30,2014 and knew I HAD to return!! Such a rich history there for any race fan, AMAZING to see where so many great horses have ran, it is very clean, with an exceptional staff, Art Deco design making you feel like you stepped back in time. I visited again for the the Breeders Cup, specifically the watch the Breeders Cup Classic, my 17yo son went with me and enjoyed the day as well. Such an amazing place/amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673juliae
40,Best Race Track in Southern California,"This place is historic. Racing first started here with ""Lucky"" Baldwin, the founder of Arcadia. The gardens are beautiful.

50,Fun afternoon with a beautiful view!,"My husband and I enjoyed our afternoon at Santa Anita. We always have lunch in the Turf Terrace. In addition to tv screens at each table, you overlook the finish line area and the large screen there. Perfect ways to watch the race. We also enjoy the view of the mountains. It's fun to walk down and see the horses in the paddock area before each race. A wonderful afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232dianec
50,Great family fun in the infield,"Had a ton of fun. Lots for the family to do in the infield. Will bring a picnic lunch next time, as many others did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarryBee
40,"World's most beautiful racetrack, Very Impressive","The grounds were really well maintained, the track and scenery are beautiful, the food was real good, little pricey but good. Betting was pretty simple, lots of people to help you. It's a great place to be if you like betting on horses. I usually come here for special events, not much of a gambler though, I tend to lose a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredIBEW
50,Santa Anita itself is great -avoid the Chandelier Room,"Very disappointed. Paid 65 dollars each for a ""Chef"" buffet an it was a bunch of cold cuts and pastries. While there were good quality it wasn't prepared chef quality fare. The glass of Champagne was 1/2 a glass. The sitting outside is uncomfortable unless you spend an extra $250 then you can sit on a bit better place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starviagera
50,Great track,"This is one of my favorite California tracks...hey they have hosted Breeders Cup the last 2 years, what more can I say.

50,Private party whoo-ha.,"This is a beautiful building. You do not need to be a raving horse race freak to appreciate the building and the history. We had a private party and loved the space and the quality of the event. It would, I am sure, be crazy fun to watch the horses run. But maybe another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birtch

50,Breeders Cup 2014,Attended the 2 day Breeders Cup World Championships 2014 for the second year. The event was outstanding inspite of cool and cloudy weather on the Saturday. This is a world class event at a magnificient venue. The back ground of the San Gabriel mountains makes this a spectaular location. The facility is well maintained and clean. The food truck festival on the Saturday was outstanding. Well worth the visit. Would do this again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJTeddy1
40,"Breeders cup venue, fantastic!","We came all the way from Britain to see this wonderful spectacle, we weren't disappointed. The setting for this race track is stunning with the mountains in the background. We were able to see the horses training at Clockers Corner at 7 am on the Thursday before the meeting started on the Friday. What a wonderful experience watching the sun coming up while the jockeys and trainers flexed the muscles of the horses on the track. We were there for both days racing and had a fantastic time. The facilities are good with plenty of betting booths, food outlets, and bars. There are a few things which would have made this racetrack perfect. The owners enclosure needs to be bigger, it's way too small for all the connections and the horses don't have enough room to move around or take a turn. Also, around the paddock there needs to be a stepped viewing area so the public/racing fans can get a clear view of the horses as they parade around the paddock before the race, this is essential if you are to make a good choice when betting on the race, at present you can't see anything unless you are actually next to rail! It's great that there is a TV screen in the centre of the track, unfortunately its simply not big enough to see all the action, it needs updating and enlarging! We had a fantastic time and hope to return to Santa Anita for the Breeders cup!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_flying_goose
50,Great trip for race fans,The track is amazing with beautiful views of the mountains. The people are friendly and the place is very clean. Get close to the horses !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gina1014

50,Great day at the races,"Went for the Breeders'Cup horse races, an all day event,; easy parking, beautiful location at the foot of mountains in So Calif, lot to see and do. Bring binoculars camera/cell phone, wear a hat for the fun of it-people dress up for this; guys wear jacket and some hats, too. Be sure to see the jockey area--stalls and paddock where horses & jockeys parade on their way into the track. In the stands: all prices for seats and some just pay to stand. Move around to the betting area and walk down to the rail for a closer view. Also box seats and restaurants at extra cost. A very memorable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindamg42
50,Breeders' Cup and Santa Anita Race Park are made for each other!,"Too bad there weren't more than 5 stars to give!! This was my first Breeders' Cup and first visit to Santa Anita and I don't know that I could bear to attend this event at any other track. I am from the east coast and have been to many tracks in VA, MD, PA, NY and KY...nothing compares to Santa Anita...not Keeneland, Saratoga or Belmont (and I love all 3). The facility itself is so well suited to hosting such a large event as Breeders' Cup. Even with 61,000+ people in attendance on Saturday, it didn't feel unbearably crowded. There was still room to walk around the paddock, lines for food and restrooms were not bad. Betting machines were a bit confusing but lines were not that long. Multiple, multiple gift shops that were well-staffed and stocked. I cannot say enough about the wonderful volunteers, some of which were stationed at key-photo op places (Zenyatta's statue) just to take visitors pictures. Even security personnel were accommodating and friendly. There were lots of cars (of course) but traffic control was pretty good and it didn't take nearly as long as I feared to get back to the highway. Nothing like the 3 hours it took to get out of Belmont's parking lot on Belmont Day! I had reserved grandstand seats, which were very nice, but didn't use them that much. There was plenty of room around the rail if you wanted to stand along the home stretch. The apron is tiered so even with a large crowd, visibility is pretty good. I didn't get to the infield, but it looked like it would have been fun for folks with kids. And the views everywhere you looked could not be beat. The mountains, the palm trees, the flowers...gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Absolutely worth the trip across the country!!!! I can't wait to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N964ADpatricias
50,Fantastic Breeder's Cup Experience! Tracks do not get better than this!,"First class event and track. Came here for the 2 days of Breeder‚Äôs Cup. Bought tickets well in advance directly from the event and quite expensive (Section K, below the walkway) - $125 for Friday and $300 for Saturday. I have been to many tracks but this has to be the most geographically beautiful track anywhere. The mountains are big and in your face. Being in Southern California the weather was fine, late in the season so skies are blue. Parking was hassle free and cheap ($10). It was even easy to exit and the end of the day (what happened to the LA traffic gridlock??). They had AWESOME food trucks (and I mean awesome ‚Äì the best truffle fries EVER and great lobster roll!!!) in the infield. Did not see any ‚Äúunsavory‚Äù patrons (unlike the Kentucky Derby where there is high society, and then there is the infield that is filled with drunks, people in clothes that look like they have been rescued from the trash, etc.). Really enjoyed our 2 days here. Visited the paddocks. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Would come back to the event ‚Äì but would not pay $425 for the 2 days. Instead I would go to the infield: it had a live band, places to sit (permanent picnic tables set up) that were in the sun or shade, and there was a TON of room if you brought your own tailgating stuff with you. We did not go early in the day and there was still room to set up your gig. First class event!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraBaja
50,Most Beautiful Racetrack in North America,"Went to the Breeders Cup at Santa Anita Park this weekend. The views of the mountains behind the track are breathtaking. Great atmosphere, and great customer service. Much nicer than DelMar, which was dissapointing. Can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sportrocket

50,Terrific Venue - first class customer service,"I have visited all of the major tracks in the US (including Churchill, Belmont, Pimlico, Del Mar Saratoga) and my experience at the 2014 Breeders Cup was the best. The grounds are immaculate, the views are stunning and the best part was the staff. Everyone from the security staff, to the ushers, cashiers, food. Servers and janitorial crew were friendly and accommodating. If you like forest racing, you won't go wrong visiting this outstanding facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliveinsf
20,NOT Hollywood Park!,"I visited Santa Anita to celebrate my mother's 88th birthday as she is an big horse fan. The first problem was actually finding where to park. There were NO signs. After asking several different attendants we were directed to the handicap parking area. Of course, it was full! Del Mar race track offers VIP parking for handicapped people when their lot is full. And they provide a tram which takes you right to the front gate. Not at Santa Anita. We were told we had to park in the regular lot and walk or pay extra for valet. So, we were forced to valet park. From there it was extremely difficult to figure out how to get my mother in without taking stairs and walking a mile to the box seating. Again, no signs or direction. My poor mother was exhausted by the time we found our box which was way down the track. In addition, we had to pay $2.50 for the daily race program. Again, it is complimentary at Del Mar! If we visit Santa Anita again, we'll have to rent a wheelchair for my mother. But I doubt we will ever visit again. They should have closed Santa Anita and not Hollywood Park - which was a joy to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunny0016

50,Santa Anita Race Track,Just a quick note that if you are ever going to visit a race track Santa Anita is one of the nicest in the world. A classic location for a classic race track. Just go for the views and experience and you will enjoy your day very much,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/548jamesv
50,Worth a visit,I really liked this place. It was my first time visiting and I will go back. It is a bit confusing at first but with some research before going will help you as far as betting and the horses. Very clean and organized place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mglluvs2trvl
50,Historic with a touch of modern,Santa Anita Race Track is introducing many new accommodations to attract a younger and more vibrant crowd while preserving the history.

50,Fun Place to Watch the Horse Races,"This is a beautiful horse racing park in Arcadia. We like to have lunch, bet on the horses, and cheer on our favorite (sometimes we are lucky, sometimes not).Santa Anita is a legendary race track, starting in 1907.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,It was ok,"Nothing special about this place unless you remember the entrance was filmed as a part of the movie Family Vacation many years ago. Like so many things in this area it is old and tired and, while still kinda cool, not that awesome compared to similar venues elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelm461
50,Sea Biscuit Tour & Box Seats Recommended,"We spent a fun, family day at Santa Anita on a Saturday. They have a great playground in the infield and on this particular day they had bouncy houses, carnival games, and face painting too. We took the Seabiscuit Tour, which was great. (I wouldn't recommend it for little kids, but mine managed.) We also splurged for box seats (which was $5 extra per person) and it was nice to have the shade, a place to put your stuff, corral your kids, and it included a TV so you can watch the World Cup or Wimbledon or a baseball game too. The food in the box seat section was very good too. The view of the mountains is breathtaking. We really enjoyed watching the horses get saddled and then watching them race. Set aside a whole day to come here if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCKelsey
50,Must see - but skip the sandwich,"The entire facility is beautiful and worth seeing. If you enjoy betting on the races, even better. We were staying nearby (in town for the weekend - for a wedding). After reading the reviews mentioning the great corned beef sandwiches, I was on a mission to get one. I was extremely disappointed (probably because I was envisioning a rueben). Anyway, we had a nice couple of hours at the track and would recommend for everyone to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603ald
50,Beautiful Racetrack!,"What a beautiful place for a horse race. Save yourself some $$ and don't bother paying for the ""clubhouse"" because the only place you can actually sit isn't any better than with the normal entry. Beer is well priced and there are a number of options for food.If you like the horses and are anywhere near Santa Anita, you need to make a stop here. This track is head and shoulders above any other in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tscshale
50,WHAT A GORGEOUS TRACK!,"I am a horse fan from South Florida. I have attended the Derby in Louisville, Calder Race Course in Miami, Gulfstream Race Track in Hallandale Beach, Florida but nothing as beautiful as Santa Anita Race Course! We went on Saturday the 10th of May and from the airport drove to Arcadia by 1 PM. Of course, my bride notices the big mall next door to the track. It is no wonder that Santa Anita is awarded the Breeders Cup in October-November. Even the food which includesa corned beef carving station is there at this track. The folks there are nice and we loved our day out at Santa Anita!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/53lindaw
50,Wonderful changes,"The race track has gone through a major over haul and it is very nice. There will be more upgrades this summer. It is worth the time to look into and explore all venues here, from the Turf Terrace, Chandelier Room, Club House...to the parties in the infield. A very fun day! Carved sandwiches are still the best food at the track, save your money for the gambling and skip the Frontrunner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/destinationaddict
50,And their OFF!!,"I grew up in New York and worked for NYRA during a few summers while on summer vacation from school. Belmont was decent, but the Saratoga Horse race Course was and still is the absolute best, in my opinion. That said, when I visited Santa Anita race Park, it too, was a beautiful setting, a great place to watch/bet on the horses and a great time to spend a day with family & friends. I very much recommend this place to go and enjoy the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyBeachLasVegas
50,Off to the races,"Santa Anita is a beautiful racetrack inside and out. The grounds are immaculate, with a view of the San Gabriel mountains. The interior has been recently refurbished, the clubhouse art deco lobby is striking. Santa Anita offers multiple dining options from gourmet to casual, if you visit on the weekends reservations are advised for the Frontrunner and Turf Terrace restaurants.We enjoyed our day at the races and dined trackside at the Turf Terrace, menu selections ranged from breakfast to sandwiches to full dinners. Our food was excellent, hot and tasty.We returned the following morning for the Seabiscuit tour, I recommend reservations for the tour, it features a short tram ride through the stable area followed by a walking tour of the paddock and jockey room. We stayed for a leisurely breakfast after the tour at Clocker's Corner and watched the horses working out on the track. What a wonderful and memorable weekend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roushmobile
40,Fun afternoon,"Went to the races this last weekend to watch the Kentucky Derby and other live races. Eat some delicious food, drink beer, listen to live music, play some corn hole, and of course bet/watch some races. I highly recommend the Lobster truck and get the lobster sandwich or the crab sandwich with butter. SO GOOD! The home town California Chrome won so the place was extra energetic. A really fun place to spend an afternoon. Visit my blog for a full review and more photos at http://msvaleriesmith.blogspot.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vjs5031
50,A fun day for all,"I have planned several events at the clubhouse, the turf club, clockers corner, and the front runner restaurant, but each caters to a different crowd, yet every time you always have a great time! I recommend planning an event at the track during the race season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ST757
50,The best horseracing expererience in the west,Purchasing a club house pass is highly recommended as the amenities and the food are first rate. The view of the mountains from the park is terrific as is the well maintained infield. You can spend a leisurely afternoon wagering and enjoying food and drink in a great environment. The valet parking is prompt and really good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregB751
50,What a Fun Day,"Had a fund raiser with my old High School at the track. It was a special, $25 covered food, a place at the table, t-shirt, program. We were in the infield. I have been there before in the stands but this was great as you could talk and move around. Met new friends at spent $20 to win $12. It was fun to see the ponies run and to take a walk around the track. Get there early (11am) and leave around the 8th race (if you can). The weather was beautiful. A great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
40,A Fun Race Track Experience,"This was my first time to this track. It is very similar to other tracks around the country. Lots of smokers and compulsive gamblers. Nevertheless, a fun betting and viewing experience.We were disappointed that the Club House restaurant was completely booked, forcing us into fast food. The setting was beautiful and the weather perfect making for a good afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pflagdad
50,Did I say free?,"Santa Anita offers free tours of the facility on weekends during the season. It was an excellent hour tour of the stables, jockey area, and track.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555paulm555
50,Great Seabiscuit Tram Tour,"You can't beat the price - free! Ideally you phone ahead to reserve a ticket on the tram tour, although you can also just show up and try to get on if there is room. The tour runs on Saturdays and Sunday's, unless there is a major event - you can check online. The tram takes you through the stable area and employee housing, it's a real little community. Then you get off and walk through the receiving barn, the silks room, the jockey's room, the staging area all the while with guide telling you all the details of the inner workings. This may be a little boring for small children. They do talk about Seabiscuit, and you can see the horse that played him. If you go a little earlier you can have breakfast and watch the horses do their pre-race workouts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirlLRacine
50,Arcadia RAce TRack,"This is a great place to visit, however I don't gamble generally. The races are exciting, the beauty of the hills and mountains make this a superb setting.Visit early on Saturday morning for a free tour and tram ride throughout the stables and grounds.My visitors to California always want to see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pollyparker2014

50,A great day!,"We celebrated my husband's birthday here with a bunch of friends and family on Sunday! We sat in the Clubhouse section which was $10 per person and kids under 17 are free. This racetrack is so beautiful and everyone had such an amazing day. We ate the corned beef sandwich with the homemade dirty chips! The food was really good. We also were allowed to bring in a cake to celebrate my husbands birthday which I thought was really nice! Just make sure you get a cake that does not require refrigeration as it cannot be refrigerated.This was my first time betting on horses and I have to say the staff here is so incredibly helpful, and they really try to help you figure out the whole process. Win, Place, Show. I cannot wait to go back in a few weeks. The beauty of track along with the fun of the races makes for a perfect so cal day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah896
50,A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR A GROUP OUTING,"Let me be clear about one thing first: I am NOT a gambler. I'm one of those ""if I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any"" types, so I just don't do it. BUT I DO love horses and old-timey atmosphere,, and friendly people and a good, stiff drink, all of which I found in spades (pun intended) at Santa Anita. I've lived in Southern California my entire life, had been to Del Mar and the recently closed Hollywood Park, but never Santa Anita. Now I wish I'd gone decades ago, because it's just my cup of tea. The place is gorgeous and it reminded all of us (a long-standing group of show biz professionals) of something out of the 1930s. We bought the Farrier's package on Goldstar for $30 each and it was well worth it. We had box seats next to each other and the package included lunch and one glass of beer or wine, plus a couple of little extras. No need to reiterate what some of the other reviews mention, because they're all true. I fully intend to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrisW536

Friendly and enthusiatic staff.the excitment of the races, compleate with a good selection of refreshment and food bars. very cheap by standards in other locations.Only $4 to park the car. $10 entry per adult, but as always refreshments are more expensive inside the track than in a bar or a burger joint.Over all a great afternoons entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artycraggs
50,"Beautiful day, colorful, exciting and maybe profitable","What a pleasure to spend a few hours at this great old track. Recent renovation have made it even better. The staff is SO helpful making even a novice able to enjoy both watching and placing a small bet. Our last trip was on a Thursday afternoon, a little light rain, just enough to make everything sparkle. We made our way to the club house and ask if a table was available. Yes indeed and we were seated close to the finish line at a table equiped with a TV monitor. Victor, our waiter, quickly showed up. He took our orders and spent the next few hours helping us in every way possible, showing how to us the betting machines, giving us directions to other things, and when pressed even offered some hints. Great experience, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDwalkerSOCAL

50,Bucket List,"Check off the bucket list. Well we are going again 2014. It was a great experience for horse lovers and the horse betters. The weather was great, the view of the mountains from the racetrack was breath taking. Only set back was the parking for Breeder's Cup day. The parking lot is within the mall parking and there was no help getting out the thousands of cars in the parking lot. We ended up leaving the car after half hour of not moving and walking back to hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gina1014
50,Got to do it again!,"I live only an hour away but hadn't been here in thirty years. I could kick myself for not coming back in all that time. My New Years resolution is keep coming back. The place is Gorgeous and very well run. Not at all expensive for such a fun time. Where else can you walk through the gates of such a beautiful place, be entertained by some of the best athletes in the world, and it only cost $10 for a family of four, plus $4.00 to park. You can't even park at Dodger Stadium for that price. Bring you picnic lunch and day camp in the infield. Spend a couple of bucks on a horse with a funny name and see what happens. You can have a great family outing with the kids and still spend less the $20. That is crazy! I am hooked.You can enter through gate six and park right next to the tunnel access to the infield.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staythurstymyfriends
50,Worlds apart,"Sometime in the seventies, my dad took me to Santa Anita Racetrack for the first time. It was in the late Fall, when a chill was in the air, smog was minimal and the Oak Tree Meet was on. He bought two clubhouse admissions and a couple of seats in the stands, armed us with racing forms and programs, pointed out General Omar Bradley in his usual spot and we settled into our seats to plan our strategies. We never cashed a ticket, pretty consistently betting on the horses which ran the wrong way. But, win or lose, they were wonderful times. We walked down to the paddocks and admired the beautifully landscaped grounds. Daddy bought himself a hot dog in the grandstand while I fell in love with the freshly carved roast beef served on a turf roll. Ack Ack and Affirmed became part of my vocabulary and I learned to recognize jockeys such as Willie Shoemaker, Laffit Pincay Jr and Eddie Belmonte.All these years later, Daddy, Omar Bradley and even the Oak Tree Meet are but fond memories, strongest felt when I'm back at Santa Anita. It's as though there's such some thin veil of time separating Then from Now and I can almost reach out and touch yesterday. Laffit Pincay, Jr and Bill Shoemaker are no longer there in the flesh, but there are bronze statues of them to remind me. I smile at the bugler and the voice of the announcer calling the race. We still favor the clubhouse roast beef on turf rolls. My betting skills have turned out better than Daddy's but only just barely.And truly, the years have been kind to Santa Anita. Bets are still (amazingly) a minimum of $2.00 and the dance is unchanged. Scour your forms (or play eeny-meeny-miney-moe), and lay down your bet. Watch the action from the finish line if you wish, or via a tv screen on the board or at your seat. Though I prefer the more at-one-with-the-action sensation of being outdoors, there's always the option of dining at a comfy booth in the FrontRunner Restaurant, where you can watch the race and admire the view via the expansive wall of glass. Or you can dress up (yes, there is a dress code) and do it in style at the Turf Club (which I've yet to do at this particular track).I love the rush of excitement as the horses approach the home stretch. I love the magnificent view of the foothills when we're blessed with clear weather. It's a fun day's outing which temporarily sets you worlds apart from the everyday-- away from traffic, shops, and canned music. And for me, it's a chance to sit back, smile and remember those long ago outings with my dad, and the fun we had together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailg306
50,Fun,Took our lunch and had a great time we had so much fun met a lot of nice folks that seemed to be playing tracks from all over I did good to do Santa Anita.The weather was so great we went two week ends in a row the parking was so easy as we had a person in a wheel chair and he had no problems at all getting around fun had by all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41Jeanniec
50,A Day Full of Fun!,"Had SO much fun here on New Year's Day. I had been to the Hollywood Park racetrack one time before, so I sort of knew what to expect, but my boyfriend had never been to the races and we both had a blast here! We found a great deal through Goldstar.com for $30 each which got us admission, (great) box seats, a free craft beer, and an entree (we went for the hand carved sandwiches [YUM!!]) AND a souvenir pint glass from the gift shop. We got there in time for the 3rd race and stayed until the very end. Lots to do, seemed great for the families with kids, and also nice to have a box seat AWAY from the ""family areas"" considering we were drinking and betting and having some adult fun. We will definitely return and will probably sit in the same section and eat at the same place. I am going to dream about that chicken sandwich!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kungfoofighter82
50,Gorgeous Venue!,"Were there for Breeders' Cup weekend. Very impressed with facilities, and every employee we encountered was incredibly polite- unexpected, as this is their busiest 2 days in their season.

50,Breeders Cup,My daughter and I returned to Santa Anita Park for the 2nd year in a row from Montana. The grounds are simply beautiful from the paddock to the track.

I just can't say enough about how much I love this place.....but most of all the horses.You can be sure4 we will be back next year!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberlyP560
50,Breeders Cup,"Beutiful track with great scenery. Track has a nice mountain backdrop which makes for stunning photos. Interesting quirks with the track as well with some out of the norm racing configurations. Staff was hit or miss with some being great and some being awful. Plenty of food options at standard over priced concession stand prices. For those of the betting type, the track offers a strong speed bias favoring front runners. Great track and would love to visit again some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magicandbird
30,Breeders Cup,"Track is very nice. They for the most part do Breeders Cup well. They certainly have the great weather and a friendly staff. I have never seen so many available betting windows. Free programs are unheard of in the real world. Now for the completely unacceptable . I paid $225 dollars for the two days. Our seats were in section O. Not bad seats and I knew the price going in. However from our section and the sections around us there is not a tote board you can actually read. It was not just my old eyes but everyone around us. This is just crazy in the real race world. We also don't need food trucks, concerts, and dumb hats. Pre adds featured Bo Derek and fascinators instead of horses. Only if the northeast was warm in Nov!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2375GZrichardc

40,A Mucho Good Trip,"Second time back to the track and great improvements in a year. Last year, the lines for drinks were way too long and they ran out of beer, ran out of water! Yikes! This year they had many more drink stands - although the bars did run out of limes - but I can still drink a vodka and tonic without a lime. Food was good. Bathrooms were clean - important for women - and no lines where I was - also important. Pleasant betting staff as well. And the weather was beautiful. And most importantly, Mucho Macho Man won! We'll go back next year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99karend
40,The Great Race Place!,"This past Weekend ( Nov 1 & 2nd) had the pleasure of attending the Breeders Cup at Santa Anita Race Park in Arcadia, Ca. A very nice impressive facility, both racetrack & landscaping.. Even on these very busy days, there was plenty of parking available with a ""tram"" to take you to the main enterance, which was a nice touch upon entering the racetrack. The grounds were very well maintained, and the restrooms and all public areas were clean and presentable. Security staff were noticable thru out the entire complex. All the staff at Santa Anita were pleasant and helpful from the betting windows/tellers to the bar/cafe areas! There was also entertainment and food trucks to make the weekend even more festive. Perfect weather TOO! The mountains are a great backdrop to the races.This is one of the nicest racetracks in the country. A very enjoyable two days at the Races at a historic old racetrack! looking forward to next years Breeders Cup at Santa Anita. Overall Rating ~ Very Good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larilu
40,Just enjoyed the Art Deco of this amazing building,"It was s beautiful day in Southern California. I had never been to this race park but always loved looking at the photos. We were lucky to be in the clubhouse. I did not gamble but it was delightful to see all the people that maintain the track. It was fascinating to see how much work it took to maintain the turf after a race. It was impressive to listen to the horn being played before each race. Each time they played a familiar song. I'm glad I was there today with two friends. As we were walking into the park, a kind gentleman gave us three free tickets to the clubhouse. Some very nice southern Cali hospitality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrammyJ43

This is after all the venue of the world famous Breeders Cup and has more real history and kudos than most LA attractions. Would recommend this venue even if you are not a race fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Axecroft

40,take your family to the infield,"The grounds at Santa Anita are very pretty and well kept. The infield has a playground and is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon with the whole family. You can bring in your own cooler of food and drinks as long as you have no glass containers. Lay down a big blanket, set up your chairs and enjoy the day. You can watch the horses run, make bets nearby and not have to be in the crowded areas. There are plenty of restrooms, not all as clean and pretty as they could be, but still better than most city parks. Check with the park for the tram tour. We went about 9 o'clock in the morning and went through the barn area and then got a walking tour through the receiving barn and jockeys silks room. The tour was free, informative and we all enjoyed it. There is breakfast available at clockers corner. The food was okay, the service was really nice and we got to see owners talking with the jockeys. If you stay inside you are also in free for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annieb318
30,"Steeped in history, but we had a bad visit.","We live 3 miles from Santa Anita. In the winter they give stable tours, although the day we went it had rained. Which may explain why they were so disorganized that we never got our tour. But if you want to watch and bet on the ponies, this is a great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilibro

40,"The ""PONIES""",I used to have a friend that owned two race horses and he went to the track everyday. I went with him mabey a few times a week. We worked together on the graveyard shift and he studied the racing forms at night. He finally quit his job and took his retiement money and his ponies down to Calexico. I never heard from him again. I'm not a big better but I do have fun going to the track,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodagain

50,What FUN!,We hadn't been here in 18 years and know now that 18 years is too long! We were there for the Santa Anita Handicap which we watched from our box seats. Its worth the extra money and not that expensive and the shade was nice with 80 degree plus weather. There were 11 races and the excitement of the track just soaked into us. The staff at the racetrack are friendly and helpful and really add to the whole experience. I'm one to pick the horses by their fun name or the fact that its a grey horse or by the jockey. My husband reads the stats. I win more than he does so that shows that a lack of knowledge of horses or horseracing does not detract from the fun of winning. We have sat in the infield which was also a lot of fun. I envy my husband who grew up in a family that loved a day at the races. Great for all ages! And why aren't more people there? We also went on the Seabiscuit tour the following day which was FREE and worth our time for a back scene look at the racetrack. Reservations are advised for the tour as numbers are limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenaiSeamama
50,Frontrunners restaurant,"We stopped in here for lunch and stayed for a few races. I made reservations since the weather was cool. You get a table with a television screen and that's your table for they afternoon. It's pricey but the service and food and the view and ambiance made it worth it. I hit a trifecta and paid for the day. There are statues outside of jockeys and horses. We liked Seabiscuit the best. But the bloody mary they tout isnt nothing much to write home about, but the waitress rinsed and wrapped them up for us to take home as souvenirs, so that made up for it. San Gabriel Mountains are located over the horizon. Very cool place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadtripperAmerica
50,Drinks + Gambling = Fun,This is a great place for a bunch of friends to get together and hang out. You can go through the underground tunnel and stand in the infield. You can stand inside if its too hot outside. You can go to the clubhouse for an additional $9 (we liked it there and thought it was well worth it). The entry fee is a minimal $5 and you can even see the horses upclose in the circle area for photos with owners and a show and tell before the race. Children are allowed too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sigirl33
10,Major disappointment,"Always heard about the famous Santa Anita Race Track home of the Champions. When you first walk in it looks pretty and nicely done, then you go past the entrance to the track, what a dump!!! The bleachers are empty no one seems t oclean the place, it looks and smells like the homeless are living there. (there not).Tried to eat the way overpriced food it was disgusting.

""Clocker's Corner"" is open 364 days a year (the horse trainers have to get breakfast somewhere) You get a close up experience of the horses working out with a beautiful view of the mountians. I also like to take friends during the racing season to ""The Front Runner"" a large restaurant/bar/wagering venue with a fantastic view. The food is pretty good as are the drinks.

50,Never been to the horse races?,"We have never been the the horse races before, so I e-mailed the customer services department at the track to get suggestions on how to make the day go well. Through prompt e-mail responses, we decided to book a visit for Opening Day, December 26. We purchased admission to the Club House Level and four tickets for the buffet lunch on the Club House level using the tracks website. It was advised that we arrive by 11:00 for a 12:00 first race. Parking at Gate 8 was easy and the cost was $4.00. We entered with our prepaid tickets on the far right of the entrance. We chose a table without any building structure to obscure our view of the majority of the track. Our table was a covered balcony table with a small television as well as being within view of other large screen TVs. The view of the track and surrounding community was fabulous! Our waitress was prompt to to offer drinks and explain how the buffet worked. The racing was exciting. We purchased the race program to help us get a better understanding of what was going on. We bet a little, cheered a lot, and laughed endlessly. A good time was had by all. Make a day of it....you will have a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kolby

I loved it even though it rained and was cold, me and my friends had such a fun time.Its a beautiful view and even though I didnt have a clue about horses, my horse that I bet on won 4 times! Its really beautiful and fun to see up close the horses running that fast and you can also go and see them get ready and the jockey's get on them and there are some horses that you can touch to.We were going to do the Seabiscuit tour but got cancelled due to the rain. We did have breakfast at Clocker's corner and had some delicious pancakes and was such fun just watching the horses practice.They have plenty of restrooms, food, pepsi, alcohol beverages, souvenir shop, and you dont need to bet if you dont want to. If you do I think the lowest is only a dollar or two. Whether rain or sun, there is plenty of shelter.Its really a great experience, beautiful scenery, and loads of fun for all ages, and even if you know nothing about horses you would love it. There are many people who work there and bystanders who were really helpful to answer questions and welcomes us warmly.What fun!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizbert
50,"Beautiful Track, excellent racing!","I have to start by saying that I was there during the Breeders' Cup Thoroughbred World Championships, so I am aware that the minor annoyances I witnessed were a product of the BC management and not the facility. (Ran out of beer at the sport's biggest day?)The track has a long and storied history and is almost unmatched by the beauty of its setting. (Del Mar on the edge of the sea is pretty close.) The art deco metal work on the exterior is beautiful. I also highly recommend the tour. Our guide was extremely well spoken and educated on the topic.It has been the backdrop for many famous races, from Seabiscuit's comeback in the Santa Anita Handicap to Zenyatta's Breeders' Cup Classic win, and has been filmed for movies and tv.I am very excited to be going back for the 2013 Breeders' Cup",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeAnnB

50,Breeders' Cup 2012 was fantastic,The team at Santa Anita could teach other tracks how to handle a major event like the Breeders' Cup. The hospitality by the entire staff was outstanding. The track has ample parking and getting out of there after the races took less than 30 minutes. That is a far cry from the 90+ minutes it takes to leave Churchill after the Derby! The view of the track is amazing and the timing in between races was just right. WELL DONE!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMZB_KY
30,Breeder's Cup 2012 in Santa Anita,We paid $75.00 per ticket to be in the grandstand and we could not hear a thing. Breeder's Cup is a big event in the racing circle and we were very surprised that they did not ensure that theirPA system was not in its greatest state. We could not hear the National Anthem singer and thecrowd started to sing at the very end to help out. We were quite disappointed at the agedequipment of this world renowned track. We believe it has seen its great days. We still had agreat time watching the races though. Another thing that surprised us was that there were notraffic officers directing traffic after the event. It took forever to get out of the park. They couldhave organized the exit from the parking lot a little bit better. It seemed like they did not preparemuch for the Breeder's Cup.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linrabCanada
30,Needs Improvement,"We just attended the Breeders Cup here and had two major issues with the track.First, they allow smokers, and there are many, are permitted to gather in various places in the Clubhouse to puff away at will. All of the smoke drifts up into the seating areas making for an unpleasant experience for non-smokers.Whoever is in charge of traffic management is a total idiot. After the races they routed auto traffic in an opposite direction down the only lane the shuttle buses could use to access the park. This left the shuttle stuck out on the road, unable to enter Santa Anita. It was not until the traffic cleared that the buses could enter the track. What a fiasco!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NWOhioGuy

40,exciting,"I've been coming here since I was just a little girl as my Father attended all his school years with Willie Shoemaker who was a famous jockey here. My favorite thing to do is to come with a large group and picnic in the midsection of the track. You can sit on blankets or chairs that you can bring and carry in along with an ice chest filled with lunch (i've hidden alcohol beverages at bottom) though you can purchase food there. Betting is also available in this section while the horses race around you. They even have an outside play area for the kids too. The scenery of the mountains and palm trees are gorgeous if you decide to sit in the grandstands which face that direction but you will have this same view from the midfield aswell.

Compared with other tracks like Arlington, the service level for food and beverages is a let down. No service to the boxes and understaffed in the areas you go for a sit down drink or meal. I will still go, but could be even better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IDWTH
40,A fun day!,"We recently went to the park, and had reservations at the Front Runners Restaurant. It was really a treat, because this restaurant overlooks the finish line, and has a beautiful view of the mountains. Not to mention, there are TV's at every table, and a full bar. The food was pretty good, but make sure you order early. Most people arrive right around 12:00-ish, and the restaurant and the wait staff gets slammed. Reservations are a must!http://www.santaanita.com/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt
