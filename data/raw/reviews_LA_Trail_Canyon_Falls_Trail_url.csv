50,Saturday Morning 2.09.19 HIKING TO WATERFALL,"Saturday begin with me doing my research on the trail, which started off good, so i started to prepared my camera, and headed out toward the Trail Canyon Falls. It took me about 1hr and 30mins drive there. I find parking easy and no permit needed as most car that park alongside me do the same.I started off seeing a lot of beautiful moutains and flowers that begin to bloosom. there were atleast 7 little creeks that you have to cross either in water or on the wood that was along the way. i decided to get my shoes soaked up to get ready for the waterfall because i am tempting to go inside the water to swim.As i walk about 40mins in, i saw a lot of hikers headed back and they are all mentioning that the waterfalls was beautiful and magneficient. I begin to get excited and started to speed up. Along the way, i took pictures of the mountains, trees and some birds. it was a great breezy weather day that give a little bit of sun to keep us warm.I finally, got to the waterfall, through climbing down the rope which was easy. I begin to set up my camera, and started to shoot multiple photos, before i begin to jump in the water to swim for about 3mins. the water was insanely cold and most people that were there did not want to get in the water, however i was too excited and i don't really care how the cold the water was, i started jumping into the water.Overall, experiences of the hike was amazing and fun. it was an easy hike for me, because i used to hike a lot tougher trails so it seem natural. if you want to come here, i suggest come early and bring plenty of water, foods and energetic energy to begin your early morning or late afternoon atmosphere.Goodluck on your journeys and adventureneverdied is here on 2.09.2019",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
50,Gorgeous Water Fall and hike,"Trail Canyon Falls is a moderate hike to a water fall located in the Angeles National Forest. There is little to no shade so wear sun screen and bring plenty of water. Once you arrive at the Falls, you will have to take a rope down to it. I was on my butt for this part and my knees coming back up so please be careful. Once you are there, it is well worth it. The hike took me just over 2 hours moving time. The distance was 4.7 miles there and back. Lastly, parking on the street only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sageskye2304
50,"Moderately challenging, enjoyable hike","This trail is easily accessible, not too crowded, and leads to both the top and base of a waterfall that was not much in July but that we were told is full of water in the winter. You will probably have to park at 19300 Gold Canyon Truck Trail, Sunland-Tujunga, CA 91040, and walk up the dirt road to the base of the trail. We completed there and back in two hours, but we were passing everyone else on the trail, so maybe give yourself more time than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fiveboro
