50,A Fun Outing!,I took my niece and nephew to Go Cart World. They had tons of fun! It is conveniently located and not far from our home. They were so happy to be driving a real car! Attendants were courteous and helpful. We plan to visit againLoretta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise581758
50,race look a pro at Go Kart World,I have raced at GKW over the past several years and found it to be quite enjoyable. You fee just like a pro driver on the track and it is great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7847peterson
40,Cool Spot!,Go Karts are fun and can be expensive. This place seemed reasonably priced. My 11 year old and 13 year old had a blast and so did I. 6 tracks to choose from. Check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SClemens
40,Great value and great fun,We did the groupon. Go during the week and you can ride as many times as you want for 2 hours . My kids are almost 12 and really enjoyed it. Good for a 2-3 hour visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,Quick family outing,Everyone was bored so my boyfriend suggested going go carting. K1 was too busy so we ended up here. Glad I came. It's not to expensive and kids of all ages can ride. Will definitely be back soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/877paulal
30,Party time,"We went to go kart world for my daughter's birthday. The kids had a lot of fun. The food was not bad. The problem is the parking. We had friends who did not go because they could not find a place to park. The parking lot is too small, but I guess the location is why the parks is so bad. They need to figure out a way to improve that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciaw915
50,Too much fun,If you got a spare few hours you want to just go feel like a kid again this is somewhere you gotta go! My husband and I went for 4 hours and it was the best fun I've had in years. Pic green car 5 or red car 15 if you want fast ðŸ˜„,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barendinas
10,"Really in need of investment, staff are awful, over priced","Visited here on a Thursday evening recently. Place was run down and had a horror-movie-set feel to it.90% of the staff looked like they absolute hate their jobs. It was explained to us that the track was ""quite slippy"" and the tyres had poor tread, so we needed to make sure we went slowly through the final corner. Some of our group skidded and spun a couple of times, which... was to be expected, and is surely part of the fun, and also a result of the under investment? Well who knows, but without receiving a single warning, two of our party were barred from any further races by a rather unpleasant manager-type chap. It said, ""you are going too fast through the corner. No more racing for you."" It was pretty obvious that the guy just wanted a quiet evening and couldn't be bothered to do his job, maintaining the safety of the course and helping drivers who have got into difficulty.Meant we had $30 of tickets that they were unable to use, and they wouldn't refund them either.Honestly - I bet this place was amazing 15 years ago. These days, without sacking the management team and injecting a load of money, it's going to rot away.Give it a miss and help put this place out of it's misery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpatrickedwards
20,Expensively inoperable,Most rides were in disrepair making everything difficult. The place was nearly empty on a friday afternoon. We spent half of each ride keeping the cars running. None of the seatbelts could be adjusted so saftey was a major concern for the younger set. The tracks were fun as all racing things are once we were able to get the cars running. The arcade machines were taking coins and the no refunds policy was pushed at us. 75% of the machines were inoperable but not labeled as such. This place needs a major renovation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marchellp2016
40,Only go for the cars,The cars are awesome. Everything else is lacking the arcade is from the 80's. The snack bar wasnt open when I went on A Friday evening and all the employees are just like wondering around and not really stationed at a particular area. Maybe it works the business but the perception gives you a feeling of chaos. The cars are awesome though!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/964andret
10,DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE!,"This place is a safety nightmare. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE! I work in the theme park business and have seen many family entertainment centers. This one is the bottom of the barrel. Seat belts that don't work, car control systems that don't work, lack of track supervision, dirty, car fumes, rundown.....4 of the kids I took were all stopped in line at the end of the session. One car came in FULL SPEED and crashed into all of them from behind. They all hit their heads against the cars and were crying. They did NOT or were NOT able to limit the speed of the cars as they came into the loading area!! The car I was driving with my 8 year old stopped working and we were stopped in the middle of the track. We sat there for many minutes as cars passed us. I waived my arm and nobody came. We were hit at FULL SPEED from behind. Both of us are not feeling well. The track crew clearly was not watching. We were finally pushed off the track. However, while we were being pushed off the track there were cars racing past us at FULL SPEED. This put us at risk and the employee behind us. Clearly they don't have control of their cars and are putting their guests and employees at risk.They gave us ice packs as requested. When I spoke to the manger about this, he refused to fill out an incident report and told me I should call the police if I had a problem.Avoid this place and tell all you know to stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcD6017OS
40,Truly a Go KArt World,If you enjoy Go Karting this place is for you. They have many different tracks to suit all tastes. The mini indy is perfect for the little ones while the slick and super track are thrilling for the adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crease131
10,DANGEROUS!!!!,"BAD, BAD, BAD! They donâ€™t provide helmets, the cars are old. The people in charge behave like they are high! Expensive, disorganized, exhaust fumes, dirty, and they mix kids with adults in the same track. Negligent people and manager operate this place! VERY DANGEROUS! My son got hurt and we had to take him to the hospital. He got hurt badly in the head and resulted with a BROKEN RIB too! THIS PLACE SHOULD BE CLOSE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbarellachamo
50,Great Fun,"My family would come here all the time when I was little. The building is old, so if you can look past the cosmetic issues you will have a good time. There are 4-5 different tracks and I was able to use the fast karts for the first time. The staff is always fun to interact with and I'm always able to engage in a friendly competition with other drivers.If you're in the area and want to have some good go-kart fun. Stop by this spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kechat
50,Even the kiddy tracks are cool.,"20 bucks gets you your license for the fast karts that go 45, cool staff. I biffed it a couple times but you get better and its way worth it and fun for couples",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielnb23
40,Great Thing To Do Once,"If you like go-carts, this facility offers five different race tracks. It's not a new place, so if you can look past the peeling paint and the dated design, you will see there are lots of smiles to be had! The slick track was my favorite, although it was neat to have a go cart track that went up and down hills. The carts are unlike other's I've experienced. They are really deep, so once you're in, the odds of you falling out are pretty close to zero. But because they are so tight and low, if you are a larger person, it may be difficult to get in them. This is not a cheap activity. But if you are looking for an hour of fun, this would fit the bill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanEsq12
40,so much fun,"Just finished a bday party there. Omg. this was so much fun for the kids and the dads. Our party host Eric was real nice and good at getting things done. Everyone had so much fun. We got the basic party package only because i would rather bring my own cake, but the kids got their 2 slices of pizza and juice , and scarfed it down so fast so they can go back on the karts. The wrist bands guaranteed 6 rides. It was $30/child for the package which came with tokens too. It was worth the money seeing these kids and adult men have all this fun.We had a reserved picnic table for an hr but since being this time of the yr it wasn't very busy so we had our table much longer.The rides itself i think were about 3 min long , and being no lines the kids didn't have to wait that long to go on again.MY only complaint is that there were a few younger kids that were too small to go on karts but was still charged the $30 for the young ones( party price), which i think it should have been cheaper, since they could only do the kiddie motorcycle ride. And they could only go on the older rides with an adult, essentially means that the adult needed to buy a wrist band($25). I spent a pretty penny here, but...in the end it was the best party ever had for a 6 yr old.there are height requirements so they had 2 faster tracks that older kids can go on, which looked like a alot of fun. and by the end of the night it got pretty busy.But so memorable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isacameth
40,Good but not cheap kids outing,"This place is a bit rough around the edges. However the staff are good, the choice of different types of karts is good for kids and they don't seem to notice the worn patches, being too excited most of the time.We have never eaten here but they do food and snacks. It's not near much else but right beside the freeway so it's easy to get to and from.The choice of tickets and wrist bands is a bit complex, best I can figure it, if you have kids who want to keep going, buy the wrist bands. If you have kids who will do a few races but would rather play in the arcade, buy individual tickets. You can buy wrist bands for an hour, two hours or all day on line at a decent discount to purchasing in the place. Dont get distracted by the timing on the wrist bands, even when there were no lines, we couldn't actually do more races in an hour than the minimum number allowed per wristband. Having been a few times I have realized my kids will really only do an hour of karting before they want to do something else.It does work out pretty expensive if you have multiple kids racing for an hour then begging for money for the arcade games and trying to wheedle money for snacks. But, if you can persuade your other half that it would be better if they did the planned trip to Ikea (just one exit North) on their own, while you and the kids play, I reckon it's worth every cent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2504
