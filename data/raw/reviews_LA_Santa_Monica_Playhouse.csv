50,Great performance!,Josh is an amazing person. His one-man show is funny and an inspiring. I recommend his show for anyone. A truly enjoyable performance and evening.,Jay
50,"Great, great playhouse. Must visit","This is a hidden gem. It's on the 4th and Arizona in SM, easy parking (two parking lots with first 90 mins free and a lot of other parking). Great theater. If you're lucky enough to catch a play, they are great. It's your old school theater yet with super intimate and non-stuffy atmosphere (you'd feel equally comfortable in jeans and sandals or a little black dress). I've been going here for a few years and you'd notice that a lot of patrons are regulars.",Lana_Calif
50,"Fantastic, convenient, intimate local theater!","This intimate, local venue is superb for shows. It has a welcoming entrance with a lovely patio, clean restrooms and conveniently located in the heart of downtown Santa Monica. Public and reasonably priced parking is plentiful in the garages. My personal favorite is the parking lot just north of wilshire. The show that we saw here, ‘We Should Hangout Sometime’ was incredible. It was touchingly, hysterical and awe-inspiring! Josh, the lead in this one-man show, is a remarkable comic, and exquisite performer who had us in stitches, laughing out loud! At times, our laughter was so uncontrollable, it got to the point of embarrassment! Josh is an extraordinary storyteller, and his true life story left the audience dazzled in amazement, only yearning for more! i suggest that everyone needs to have a dose of Josh’s humor and a shot of inspiration! I’ll be taking more of my friends back for more!",WillinLa
40,Magic Visit on Magic Monday,"Good night out on, er, Monday for the Magic Monday Magic Show !Made the mistake of forking out extra dosh for the front row seats. Not worth it, as this is a very small venue and just about every seat gave a good view if the stage.Well, you live and learn.I noticed that Goldstar were offering discount tickets, so that may be an option if you are booking ahead.The show itself was good fun and the three acts on offer made it good value.",glasgowbigyin01
40,Charming shows in a historic venue,"Eager-to-please performers delivering enthusiastic shows, skewing towards the light and frothy comedic side of the scale are generally showcased here. This tiny complex of a few different stages has hosted a variety of works for over 50 years and chooses productions that are well suited to small stages where every seat is a good seat. There is a quaint courtyard where the house staff usually handle tickets and serve refreshments before the show, and where cast members greet audiences after the show. A great break from the usual commercial retail hustle and bustle of the neighborhood.",Ray Q
40,Intimate and fun,"Saw a kitschy, musical, drag version of Cinderella which was pure silly fun. This is a very small, intimate theater. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Easy walk from parking structures and restaurants galore.",Michael S
50,"You have to see ""Jamaica Farewell"" - a one woman show by a super talent that plays over 20 characters!","""Jamaica Farewell"" is actress/writer Debra Erhardt's personal story. In 90 short minutes (no intermission) she tells her amazing story of her life in Jamaica and her dream to come to America. Along the way she overcomes many pitfalls and challenges. She tells all with many laughs, pathos, tons of energy and enough dramatic effect that allows you to imagine the picture of the scenes she creates. Do not miss this show.",JulianSolo
40,Great little theatre in the heart of Downtown SM,"Craving some culture? Head over to SM Playhouse for a one act play, a cabaret or children's performances. There's something for everyone. It's a great local theatre company and fun little space within walking distance of good restaurants, bars and public parking (and the bus).",88jet88
50,Great New Year's Eve Musical Review,"Two shows with buffet supper (nothing special), dessert, wine, champagne, party hats and delightful staff who turned out to be the performers! All original songs, but masterfully presented and thoroughly enjoyable. The staff was extremely helpful with best tickets and seating for my sister in a wheel chair due to recent surgery. Families with young children were there to enjoy the early performance.We appreciated being able to drive home before all the drunks got on the highway. The parking garage across the street was the cheapest theatre parking we've found in years.",MendocinoMcLeans
50,Excellent!,"Great community theatre. Used to come here for years. Now when we visit the kids, we can bring them, and the grandchildren, to most of the shows and enjoy ourselves! Tremendous talent, great selection - we are never disappointed!",2x2ontheroad4u
50,The Play Adults Keep Out is really timeless.,"Saturday nights at 7 PM if you are near Santa Monica, please go and see the Play, ""Adults Keep Out"" since it is really well done as a musical with adventure, romance and good political satire for all!",Lblivas148
50,Great Local Theater,"It seems like a hundred theaters are in LA, and everyone seems to be working there while waiting for the real break to take place.Santa.Monica Playhouse is not that kind of theater. A dedicated band of actors and staff struggle to keep it going while producing excellent theater.A specialty on weekends is children's theater - local parents would do well to take advantage of this local gem!",BrianFromMcFarland
20,Not The Playhouse Of My Dreams,This is a run down theatre that is a fire trap and desperately in need of serious renovation. It is a shame because their venues are excellent. It is a mystery why the city has not condemned this building.,cuppajoe2

The shows are entertaining for adults as well as children. The shows have clever dialog, singing, dancing, audience participation, and lots of energy and enthusiasm. I have taken my daughter and all the children in my life to many shows. We've also had birthday theater parties-- tons of fun.",rqta
