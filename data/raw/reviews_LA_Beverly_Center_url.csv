50,Great Mall,"Super nice mall! I really like it here, between the shops and all the restaurants in here, it really is a great mall. Tons to do even in the area, highly recommend checking it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilsonLin
50,Lovely mall,Had a great shopping experience here whilst on holiday in beverly hills. Went on a Tuesday morning so it was nice and quiet. Lots of designer shops but I fell in love with macys and got lots of designer labels at knock down prices so was able to bring home lots of pressies for the grandkids. Staff were super helpful in there too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loveholsinthesun
40,Shopping for the discerning patron,"High end products at a premium price. Getting around was a bit confusing at first, especially if you enter via the shop fronts, but we got to where we needed to be. The whole feel of the place is a almost like it isn't finished yet - and the food court is small and unappealing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pegasus928
30,Very big but missing a lot,"We spent a few hours circling the mall and found some great shopping, but there are a lot of main stream shops missing from this place, considering the size, I would have thought it could have had more variety. No real bargains to be had, but that isn't what this shopping centre is all about. This was our high end shopping day and it was the right place for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzTraveller99

50,Happy Clients,"Both I and my wife are frequent visitors to this one-of-a-kind Shopping Paradise, thanks to the Conceirge, Mr. Sammy. Over the course of last few years, we have seen him cater to the clients' needs with much calm, cool dexterity. Not only him, but the young team of Service personnel display an identical attitude, thanks to the constant watch he maintains.Coming from Canada a few times a year, we enjoy the hspoitality of some of our close friends here. What Sammy does, with his captivating smile, is take our enjoyment of the trip a few notches up.Please make it a point to say Hi to the people at the Conceirge Desk, and ask for Sammy.

50,Super trendy and high end,"The newly redecorated BEVERLY center has lots of places to sit. It‚Äôs very bright. The stores are the most expensive, Tiffany‚Äôs , Prada, etc. although uniglo is on the top floor. The stores have the most bizarre shoes, fun to look at, probably uncomfortable to wear. Not crowded on a Friday afternoon.the apple store is huge and popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyemlucky

50,Beautiful mall - park correctly,This is a huge beautiful mall with tons of great stores- and bargains too. Download the Beverly Center app for a directory of stores and then see where the closest parking is. You will save yourself a ton of walking by parking correctly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debsi

40,Better than it was...,"as you would expect after a $500 million renovation. We were mostly around the H & M store on the top floor but it gave me an excellent opportunity to notice the huge screen on that end of the mall. I found out that it is a 35 foot tall LED screen. Showing between the paid advertisements were some amazing computer generated artwork that looked ""alive"". Kept my interest for a few minutes.Other than that, it is just a shopping center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m2swim
40,Big place with mostly high-end stores,"I stopped off from my hop on/hop off bus tour from Hollywood and Highland. I was there early morning and there weren't that many people in the place. I had trouble with the new elevators - you had to pick your floor before you got in the lift and the lift kept taking me to wrong floor. I think when they get their food court, they may get more customers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixiehat
40,"Beverly Hills shopping, but there are much bigger malls","The mall is nice, but you have to pay for parking, although not overly expensive. Not to my liking. I prefer the larger malls, such as South Coast Plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
50,All the stores you need,"I always stay in West Hollywood when I travel to LA. This mall is very close to most of the West Hollywood hotels, and worth coming to even if you‚Äôre not staying in the area. It‚Äôs a big mall with a Bloomingdales and Macy‚Äôs. Across the road is Beverly connection, with all the outlet store like Ross, Nordstrom rack and marshals.between the two you could spend the whole day here. There are a few eating establishments within the mall. It‚Äôs a very nice clean mall in a very nice area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40

30,Ok mall in the Centre of LA,"Lots of parking spaces and stores like Victoria‚Äôs Secret, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren and Macy‚Äôs.

40,Nice renovations,"I've been to the Beverly Centre a few times now and since the recent renovations, it is a beautiful mall and easy to navigate. It has all the stores you would expect and some good food options. But it could have more food variety and a bit more ambience. It was quiet each time I was there and felt a bit sterile.Good for shopping, not great for the vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJLuvsHotels

40,Good place,"Very good shopping and dining place. There are most of the highend brands, parking was very easy location excellent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siyamik
30,Too expensive and cold atmosphere,A large mall for window shopping only because most of the shops are way to expensive. The atmosphere is cold...would not recommend it. I went to the grove after this and that wasn't that big but way more fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debby76
50,Window shopping experience,"If u really want to have perfect shopping, They have a lot of luxury stores and they‚Äôre usually pretty private since not a lot of people shop here. I mostly window shopped at the expensive retail stores. the only busy store was the apple store. all I can say this is one of the largest and luxurious malls I'm visiting. and a good advantage is the mall is not so busy so the noise level is very low. the parking garage is very quite, no service people were there I guess. I used my instapark app to parking my car. the food is actually very costly...You‚Äôll most likely have to go to a restaurant in the area if you want good food. There‚Äôs a ton of options across the street at the Beverly connection,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbyjayjay2
30,Under Construction - ALWAYS,"This mall is in a very fancy area or LA. It‚Äôs been under construction for a VERY VERY long time so there‚Äôs always certain areas of the mall that are closed off.LUXURY SHOPPING:If you are looking for upscale shopping, this is perfect. They have a lot of luxury stores and they‚Äôre usually pretty private since not a lot of people shop here. Weekdays are pretty quiet and weekends don‚Äôt get super crowded.BUDGET SHOPPING:If you‚Äôre on a budget and want stores that aren‚Äôt too expensive, then you have your H&M, forever 21 and macy‚Äôs. Honestly, there‚Äôs a lot of other malls in the area that are waaay better if you‚Äôre on a budget and you really want to shop.FOOD:The food court is still under construction so your food options are LIMITED. You‚Äôll most likely have to go to a restaurant in the area if you want good food. There‚Äôs a ton of options across the street at the Beverly connection, so just go outside of the mall and explore your restaurant options.PARKING:If you‚Äôre here longer than 1 hour then you have to pay. It‚Äôs kind of annoying because stores don‚Äôt validate, one the restaurants. Parking isn‚Äôt too expensive, I believe it‚Äôs around $3-4.FINAL TIP:It‚Äôs cool to check out if you‚Äôve never been, but it doesn‚Äôt have the greatest variety of stores. If you really want to shop, there‚Äôs better malls outside of LA that you can explore. (Topanga Mall, Fox Hills Mall, The Grove, etc.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsnancyestrada
30,Upscale Mall atop Parking Garage,We took escalator after escalator to get to the shopping. The view of the city is pretty awesome. We mostly window shopped at the expensive retail stores. The only shop that felt busy was the Apple Store. It was interesting‚Äîlike visiting Rodeo Drive but with much easier parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650JulieS650
20,What a waste of money??!,"The mall went through some multi-million renovation only to end up looking almost exactly the same with a new coat of paint on it and some minor unnoticeable enhancements. It looks enpty, cold, and like a dinosaur. Sorry but the best mall now and even before their renovation is the Century City Mall. I was expecting so much from this very long renovation but its so underwhelming and almost exactly the same looking as it was before. Gosh, I wish they would have just given me the money as a consultant because I could have told them in a second thar this was going to fall flat as it apparently has. Yes there are new restaurants around there but as far as stores or shopping I would just rather go to Century City mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelookforless
20,Macy‚Äôs and Bloomingdales after Christmas,"The store line-up seemed ok but found nothing interesting upon visit. Was it because it was past Christmas that I found the mall stores bare? Went thru Macy‚Äôs , Bloomingdales, Saint Laurent, L‚ÄôOccitane, Bath & Body Works. Didn‚Äôt bother checking other stores anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893lynettel
20,"Not really the Beverly Center's fault, but....","I used to love the Beverly Center, I really did. I never really cared for the Grove - to much tourism, too many people.Yesterday was my first visit after their remodeling (which was really a nightmare). I like the new design from a designer standpoint, found it cold and unwelcoming though.And unwelcoming it was - first I was shocked when I parked - no one there? I was wondering: is it closed? Then: no people. Not that I really mind, I was not looking to find new friends/ company, but to buy three things:A: A nespresso machine at Macy's - a cyber monday dealB: The iphone XS or RC: Shoes for my wonderful wife :-)Again no people = bored staff = everyone playing with some sort of mobile devize instead of giving possible customers a welcoming look to make the come in. Shoes first: the sales lady did even bother to look up. We felt so unwelcome, almost as intruders. We left.Then: coffee machine at Macy's. We were the only customers there, to sales reps. We asked for a specific machine - one had no idea what she was doing. The ""Breville Nespresso Creatista Single Serve Espresso Machine with Milk Auto Steam Wand"" in black was on display and I asked her if this model was also available in ""Champagne"". She shrugged - had obvoiously no idea what she was doing there. Shje helplessly looked to her colleague, who said in a harsh Russian accent to ""come back later"". We left.Finally: my wife and I want to get new iphones. We went to the Apple store - possibly the busiest store in the mall, but far from being really busy. We were greeted by three important looking guys with mobile devizes to ""check us in"". I asked if someone could help us to decide between the iphone XS and XR - sure, there are five people in front of me - just give us 30-60 minutes. As we had a business dinner at Cleo (around the corner) in an hour, I asked if he or any of the two others could quicky explain the difference I was whisked off - come back when you bring enough time.They must have lost their mind.We left the Beverly Center, bought shoes in an owner operated boutique oin our way to Cleo ando ordered the coffee machine from Amazon. I am seriously considering busing a Google Pixel phone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
30,Glam from outside,On first appearance it looks huge. To start the lifts are confusing you have to enter your destination before u get in at the outside controls quite confusing. Although spread out and quite a few designer stores not make international high street brands. Shops I hadn‚Äôt heard of and even Victoria Secrets although spreads out was not as much selection as would have liked. Macy‚Äôs menswear you have to enter through the ground floor street level or there is one lift that gets you there but quite confusing. Not many food places or coffee shops to stop and get something. Disappointed yes Bloomingdales and Macy‚Äôs are there but struggled to find things to buy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936sophiap
50,Huge,Largest mall we have ever been to and have visited many large cities. Larger than the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas. Every upscale shop you can think of is there. Shops are on all different levels. Macy's has a men's store and a women's store.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passport204342
40,Luxury shopping mall,All the big luxury brands can be found in this mall. It‚Äôs a bit expensive as opposed to other same brand stores outside but nevertheless if you want Louis Vuitton etc you can find it all here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MahmoudAGD
40,Beautiful Big Shopping Center,This is a very well maintained big shopping center down in Beverly hills. Beautifully designed with a nice inside decor. Almost all brands have shops at this center in addition to two department stores (Macy's and Bloomingdale's). Luckily shops were on sales when we visited so we did some shopping. Unfortunately during our visit last July some elevators linking Macy's men stores to other floors were not working so we had to cross the parking area to reach other stores.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OsmanB511
40,Beverly Center,The Beverly Center has some amazing shopping. You do have to take several escalators to get from the parking garage to the stores but the variety of stores is worth it! The 3-D Holographic wall was cool and kept my kids entertained while I shopped! The concierge workers were not very helpful so we figured things out for ourselves. Was located in close proximity to our amazing SLS hotel!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebeasley2018
20,Glam from Outside But rubbish,It is tough enough to get in and the lifts are a pain. There is limited food and drink places that are decent and when you have a shop round the selection is so so and over priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuldge
20,Needs work,"I have been here many times over the years, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be in prime shape anymore.There were quite a few shops closed and they seem to be doing some work in the centre, but it‚Äôs mystique of being a high end shopping destination seems long gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O5948IAstuarth
10,Needs a huge amount of work - avoid the lifts!,I visited this mall with my small child in a pram after going to The Grove (which is gorgeous). The parking is easy and not many people were there. However the parking is very misleading. It appeared to advertise 4 hrs for $1 but it actually cost $6 for around 2 hours.The centre is huge and is located above on a great number of floors from the carpark. The lifts are a safety hazard. The ones closer to Macy‚Äôs were out of order and the ones near the information desk were busy with lots of people waiting. You had to put the floor you were going to into a touch screen and then wait for your number to come up. They don‚Äôt work! We waited ages and then got taken to the wrong floor then up and down and eventually got out on another floor to start again. It was very stressful and I would never visit there again while I have a child in a pram. Imagine when the mall is busy!When I visited there were only 2 cafes operating - one on the top floor and one on a lower floor. The vending machine near to Macy‚Äôs was suggested by the customer service at the information as being the best option for a drink. Except that that was out of order as well.All in all I was extremely unimpressed with this centre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strategicallyb
40,Prettt comprehensive considering renovations,"I recently visited Beverly Center and was very pleased with the range of stores. Even with construction on multiple floors, the 3(ish) available stores had a wide offering. There were a lot of higher end stores out of my price range (Versace etc.) but also plenty of more affordable stores (H&M, Forever 21 etc.). Across the road is Beverly Connection which has a good range of discount/outlet stores too. Will be brilliant when the food court opens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganstericker
50,Great place to shop in the heart of West Los Angeles,"Easy place to find parking. Bright and airy inside. I found a lot of stores under once roof. Food was available on all levels. There are even restaurants with views of the LA basin. While the Macy;s is there so is the other stores to explore. Combination of food, entertainment, and shops. Better than the open air maills in the heat and smog..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eaglepipeclub
30,A Little of Everything Except...,"Want a cold drink on a hot LA day, searching here is pretty daunting with no food court that could be found and sparse options, most of which were crowded because we weren‚Äôt alone on our mission. The usual mix of high-end stores with Bloomies & Macys as anchors; the top level seems to be for the younger less extravagant crowd, with H&M, Forever & Uniqlo among the options. Lots of space to walk around; very poor wayfinding; hardly anyone around to ask info of...and a slippery floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney

40,Good shoping place at beverly hills,This mall has all the big and normal brands and huge apple store. One can shop here more conviently then rodeo drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarun2k5
20,One of the worst malls ever.,The mall is one of the smallest I ever been to. They got the high end brands like LV and Burberry but other than that it is small and not much of a gallery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimNil123
10,Calamity Jane,Welcome to Hollywood welcome to Beverly Hills Beverly Center. The center just spent 500 million dollars on a restoration and a remodel. Incredible that they pick the color white to paint the outside my grandmother would have picked a better color.This can be a fun place you're going to need to have comfortable shoes you're going to be doing a lot of walking.Everything inside the mall is expensive from clothing to food going to the movie theater or any kind of entertainment. Make sure you take out a bank loan or call your credit card to extend your credit limit before you enter the mall.As I was strolling around the mall one day with my wife I use the restroom to wash my hands and found the bathrooms filthy toilets overflowing and a disgusting smell in the restrooms. This did not happen on just one occasion this is many occasions on different days so it's obviously the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.Parking is at a premium better to park outside of the mall in public parking which is a lot less expensive than you're going to pay when you get to the mall.Shoppers beware especially if you're coming to California for a summer vacation pickpockets are at an all-time high best to travel in a group of people or with a friend to prevent this from happening to you.I'm trying to think why anyone would want to go to a mall that is so expensive. If you want to say you were there take some pictures by a postcard and send it to Grandma.One ‚òÜ Star Rating,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogonblick

10,Big Letdown,"Visiting on holiday, we got a cab to the Centre, what a waste of a fare!!. The main escalator was off and being repaired!!, Half the Centre is just boards and no sign of shops coming. If it wasn‚Äôt for Maceys and Bloomingdales we would have been in and out in 10mins. There isn‚Äôt even a coffee shop in any of the levels!.

20,A dying place,"Sadly, this is a dying place. Even though the mall has attempted to be refurbished, it's not that well done.The elevators are ridiculous: be sure to hit the button of what floor you want on the OUTSIDE of the elevator, not the inside ! How random and odd is that.The mall has a terrible layout. Smoke parking that was free on Sunday, so I'd say lark there and go elsewhere!I hope this is helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllTryAnythingTwice1
20,A Ghost Town,"I am not sure if they are finished with the upgrade of the Beverly Center, however, it looks like a car grille or something from the outside. It is not very appealing. Inside it is like a Ghost Town with not too many shops open and no atmosphere. It is difficult to find food, not functional or easy to make your way around the center and to add insult to injury they charge you for parking with no validation. Definitely skip this place and head to the Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiges88
50,"Love, love, love","Every year that we go to USA, we visit the Beverly Centre. The range of stores is excellent and the Godiva Chocolate Shop is my personal favourite! Macy's is excellent and we have found that on weekends in December, they seem to do special 'friends and family' discounts. The only negative comment I have is that the layout can be quite confusing. Some elevators only access certain parts of certain levels and it is very easy to get lost. Even my husband who swears that he has a documented 'allergy' to shopping loves the Beverly Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodidella
30,Wasn't aware going thru quite a bit of construction,I always love going shopping here but this last time was a bit odd. Didn't seem to be near as good and the construction is a HUGE inconvenience. The Lacoste store and some others do not seem to be there any longer as well?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KC_Ultraveler
20,Can't find food in shopping area,"Arrived at 11:30am hoping to find an early lunch. Only found a pretzel stand in the shopping areas above the parking levels. Other restaurants are on the first floor. However, One place was not open till later, one under construction, and the one restaurant open had a long line. Across the street I saw a strip mall with lots of restaurants open. My 6 year old boy was hungry. We ended up at Farmer's Market.When they finish the proposed eateries, I may return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Hope the reconstruction update is worth it...,"The whole block inside and out was under construction. I took public transportation from the location where I was staying downtown and I had to alter the order of my errands because of the street construction surrounding BC. There is no better way to test a person‚Äôs patience than with scaffolding, construction workers, and dust everywhere. I was on a mission to shop a specific store I knew was in BC‚Ä¶I had to walk up a ramp through the parking structure because the closest entrance through a department store was blocked. Even though there isn‚Äôt much foot traffic at the northwest corner, it was kind of a buzz kill to enter this way. I had to find what floor and the location of the store. There was scaffolding everywhere and in some ‚Äúhallways‚Äù the lighting was so dim it was eerie and maybe just a little unsafe. I found the store I was looking for and made my purchase; unfortunately later during my week in L.A., I looked at my receipt and there was a mistake. I ended up having to go to a different location of the chain store and the mistake was corrected. That store had its own issues, but to speak of Beverly Center, it‚Äôs a fun place to shop when you‚Äôve got the time to contend with but I'm pretty sure its heyday is over; the good thing is the construction won't last forever but it won't be the place to be like it was in the late 1980s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
30,Remodeling inconvenience,"I usually like shopping at the Beverly Center, but my recent visit was disappointing: dealing with reduced lanes for parking entry, closed off areas while looking for my favorite stores. I shall have to wait until the remodeling is completed to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
20,Unfinished,I expected so much more from this mall and was totally disappointed. There is construction going on outside the mall so to get in you had to walk through Macy‚Äôs Men‚Äôs Department to the elevator and then go to the 6th - 8th floors. Sound confusing? It was.I wound up in Bloomingdales which I did like. I won‚Äôt return until the construction is over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetHanover
30,Parking nightmare,"I have been here numerous times and the parking is always chaotic for me. The shops are alright and for people watching, decent place to do so. Under renovation for exterior, I am really not sure it is for the better, not it looks like a prison with wired metal decor. The old look was definitely more futuristic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semanticvision
40,Now it is almost finished the renovation its great,The newly renovated Beverly Center is beautiful. Really worth a visit. It has almost all of the upscale stores & many other popular stores too. The two anchor stores are Macy‚Äôs & Bloomingdales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvelynneG
30,Don‚Äôt forget the Beverly connection next door,"Okay, this mall is a large complex with the top two floors for shops on top of multiple floors for parking. It‚Äôs under remodel right now the highlight was to ride the outside escalator for a view of Los Angeles. There are quite a few high end stores here including a Ferrari store.Now next door is the Beverly connection which has what I would call a selection of off price stores like saks off fifth ave, Nordstrom rack, Ross, tj maxx, Marshall‚Äôs and a target. So it‚Äôs not a bad setup for those wanting luxury goods or those looking for deals",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01

50,Definitely a place worth visit for a collection of brand items,Good range of brands from Gucci to Tiffany.Also can hop over to the other mid range mall Beverly Connection selling Gap and Navy across the street.Good area to explore for both range of shopping. Use the hop on hop off bus to get you around for shopping and attractions. You must try the farmers market at the next stop too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bennylimlee
30,Just A Tad Bit Overrated If You As Me....,"The Beverly Center would be a great definition of an overrated mall. It's not a horrible mall but it's also not one that really gives me a ""WOW"" experience. You hear all sorts of things about shopping out in Beverly Hills and being apart of that whole glamorous scene but it's not quite fulfilling the hype.In the past, I've visited several times both pre-construction and most recently during construction. It's like a war zone right now but the whole renovation was much needed. The question is though will it help enhance a shopper's overall experience? That is left to still be determined. Renovated or not I really hope they implement a better parking situation because my gosh it's a mess to say the least. On my most recent visit my friend and I had to stop by the apple store and it was just an in-and-out type of thing. We couldn't have been here more than 45 minutes and when headed back out through the parking garage it still cost $2?!Yeah, yeah I know... most are probably like why is he shopping at the Beverly Center if he is complaining about $2. My issue isn't about the money but solely around the principal.. Point, blank and the period. Think about it most malls offer some sort of validation when you stay under a certain amount of time. This is the Beverly Center! If people come drop a few thousand dollars they shouldn't have to pay for parking.Bottom line is there are PLENTY of great malls and places to shop while in Los Angeles. You won't be missing out much if you just so happened to not make it to this one lol. I'll possibly visit again once the construction is completely done..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BugattiBoi88
30,Where is everything?,They‚Äôre obviously rebuilding this centre. We‚Äôve never seen so many boarded up shops with no signs of new tenants. Clearly the Center itself is going upmarket. But it was almost a ghost town yesterday. We were dying for a coffee and a small snack. The food court is gone and we couldn‚Äôt find a cafe for love or money. Strange for such a large Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
20,Massive Construction,I would advise you to avoid the Beverly Center until the massive construction project is done. There are still a lot of shops but it isn't really worth the hassle until the renovation is over. Another thing where did all the restaurants go?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsthetravelguy
30,Currently Under Construction,"My visit to the Beverly Center was short and sweet. There were lots of rich stores here like Prada, Gucci, Armani, etc. If you‚Äôre going to see celebrities, then this is the place to be. The entire mall is under construction but will be a really big mall once it‚Äôs completed. I couldn‚Äôt find a food court and it was a little confusing as to where things were. There are other shops nearby like; Old Navy and Nordstrom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J727YCkellyg
30,Beverly centre,"Currently under major renovation and construction. A lot of shops closed. Very big shopping centre with a huge variety of shops available anything from Maceys & Bloomingdales , Apple, Ferrari etc etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlW28
50,Shopping,Very nice at Hugo boss store service first class w William Ramos I really recommend the store if u like Hugo boss clothes:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/placidoa470
30,Being Refurbished - avoid it,"Wasn't aware it was being done up - best to avoid at this point in time - limited entrance points, confusing on how to get anywhere.All the expensive / designer shops are open but the place is empty and is not worth the trip at the moment.Macy's open but as usual looks like a jumble sale, dark, uninviting and just awful - although the staff are really friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benalexhw
40,A Maze,"My son and I visited the Beverly Center as there are a nice mix of stores across all price points. It was like a maze because of construction that is underway. The Macy's store was very nicely laid out and our entry point into the center. There are 8 floors but the 2 - 4 floors, I believe, are parking. When coming off the elevator, there are stores that are in a circle, while construction is being done in the middle. Can't wait to see the final product.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodjohn
40,Worth spending a half day,A quick tour around popular local and foreign stores and also some good places are just around the corner. Reasonable parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/konstanza_sf
30,One day,"Hopefully, one day this will be worth the visit. They are undergoing renovations. What is open look fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexH214
10,Just drive a couple of miles east or west...,"To either Century City, Rodeo Drive, or The Grove. This mall is the worst in terms of construction, selection of stores and parking (dishonest and shady protocol). Beverly Center is an eye-sore. Elevators skip floors, malfunction parking machines.Century City just renovated and the ambiance is peaceful with hammocks and bamboo decor.Like the other reviewers here... I would skip the Beverly Center. It will be worth your peace of mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newyorkannie7
40,Under construct but still worth a visir,Ventured here for the first time and really enjoyed the experience. A good mixture of both high and medium end stores as well as Bloomingdales and Macy's. Great choice of both men and women's clothes and felt the centre was clean and well maintained. Staff were also very helpful in pointing us in the right direct to get a taxi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Di_Australia1302
20,Exclusive shopping centre,Definitely not the time to visit. Under major renovation. only parts of some floors open. Only place to get a coffee is Starbucks on 7th floor. Feel sorry for retail tenants.Disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GieS418
30,Under renovation,"Not sure if it's because of the renovation, but the place is deserted. No restaurants or cafes, which is a bit weird. Overall, okay but not really impressed by it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoKart
30,Nothing Happening Here During Construction,"Came into the mall with the hopes to get something to eat and use the restroom in a clean and cool environment.The only place open at this time was Wetzel Pretzels and vending machines. There seemed like two other food places are open at the moment but it was so insignificant to me I don't remember. The Beverly Center doesn't even advertise what is open now, it just boasts about the five places that will open in the future.Many shops are closed. Some that are open are high end. There are also anchor shops like Bloomingdale's and Macy's.Parking was reasonable - $1 per hour. I felt it was easy to navigate around by elevator or escalator.Would return in the future when construction is complete.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasBling
40,"As malls go, this is cool, ... BUT!","All across America, malls and large scale stores are closing, or downsizing. It's the ""Amazon effect"", and while sometimes the convenience of buying online saves time, The Beverly Center is still a place you should go to, if you are in West Hollywood. You can find whatever you need here, because otherwise some things are hard to find, or overpriced. Parking is ample, and if you have kids, this can take up some time in a cool atmosphere. I mean, a mall is a mall, but this is Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/music-professor
10,Pretty average,I went to this shopping centre over 20 years ago and it was very beautiful I went there today and it's very below average there was plenty of renovations going on .. but really nothing to rave on about just that it's in great location.. but for shopping centres it's very very average,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unclechownza
40,Was the gold standard now it's bronzed,"Just passed through. Major renovations taking place, and complete disruption. I viewed some renovated parts and they were really nice. But in the end, it wasn't an enjoyable experience so for now my advice is to avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrense
30,Construction,"Place is still under construction, lot of shops are closed, some of them working but rarely, should be good once it's finished,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timbershire8899
20,Under Construction,"Few stores, poorly laid out. Trying to get back to your car is a gamble with the elevators. I'm surprised it's still open. Huge disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButchHogan
20,Eh...Not Impressed,"I was in the area and my teen son wanted to see this shopping center. It us under construction so hard to get around the place...felt like a rat in a maze. Hard to figure out where we were and hard to access any shops. We stayed for 30 minutes max. If you want an excellent shopping experience, visit The Grove instead or 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. See my reviews of those places...Also no restaurants in this shopping center which is odd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
40,All the shops you need!,Always enjoy this mall. Although it's under reconstruction at present this is still a great shopping centre and will be even better once completed. All the big brands! Floors so shopping. Directly opposite is Beverly connection with all the outlet stores you need with Ross and Marshalls.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
30,It may be better once it is finished,This is under construction when we came so it was hard to find the stores as the detour signs can be hard to follow. There were great shops there though. 3 levels of shopping fun! We had a Starline 'hop on hop off' pass which allows you to go to the customer service desk and get discounts on certain stores. I would recommend this,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189shellc
30,Construction!,"Still under mega reconstruction, as it has been for some while. Better to head to The Grove and other area malls. Really nothing special about it and the scaffolding everywhere is a decided bore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justchristine
20,Stay away for a while...Construction mess,This shopping center was previously great to navigate. The construction is horrible and it is hard to find the entrances and dark inside. The Bloomingdales was a huge disappointment and didn't carry some of the nicer brands that I would have expected in an affluent suburb. The construction makes it impossible to enjoy shopping and dining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicetoeatout
50,Shop til you Drop!!!,"You name it it's here!!! And despite the dust from the remodeling going on, there's friendly staff to guide you around on the inside of your lost! The stores are never-ending....from my fav Louis, to Tiffanys, Gucci, Lacoste, Bloomingdales and Vickis to everything in between! And of course some good ole Starbucks to keep ya pumped n going! It was great!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6089DGmariak
30,Renovation!!!,This place is doing some renovation at the moment so it's kinda frustrating to shop especially if you are shipping by Bloomingdales area which is all the construction is. Parking is good but you have to pay for it even though you were there even for under an hour. I'll come back when renovation is over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaindl
50,Pure luxury.,"All luxury brands are present there. Also non-luxury shopping is posible, you'll find an apple store and a Macy's.Bar from 6th floor I don't recommend it. No great bartenders.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maximilianos101
30,Still sort of average,"This place was being renovated when we visited and it's already a difficult place to navigate, I really H&M in there, I just don't like going there really, strange place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldwide002
50,Lots and Lots To See and Buy!!!,There are more shops than you have time for in one visit! And a good range of prices on apparel and everything else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIndaFeinstein
40,Under Renovation,"Very confusing to get around with the current renovations in progress. What we did like was that the Macy's, Bloomingdales, and fast fashion (H&M, Uniqlo) stores were well stocked and carried a great assortment of men's merchandise. Skip Gucci, Prada and the like as their Rodeo locations carry more variety of stock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellBoys60625
40,Shopping,Beverly Center is under going a remodel at this time but you can still shop. Alot of high end stores .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyH978
30,High End Shopping Under Contruction,"Visited while we were in LA, it was under construction so it was a little messy and unattractive. But let me tell you this, we had zero problem spending money in the stores. I guess once its done its going to be really from what everyone told us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonsbiz
40,Great Mall for Higher End Shopping,"A high rise mall in downtown Beverly Hills. Lots of specialty higher end stores that you won't find in your typical mall out in the Midwest. We enjoyed looking in many of the shops and bought a few things. Mall was very clean. However, it was under construction when we went but still accessible to all the stores. They offer covered mall parking within the structure. The mall has a food court and is approximately 4 stories of really nice stores. Worth a visit for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royw366
30,Upmarket mall being renovated,"We were here last time about six years ago with our whole family and were rather impressed with the structure, the external escalators taking us from the car parking levels to the 6th, 7th and 8th floor shops.Parking was cheap at $1 per hour for the first 3 hours in the multi storey car park. The costs goes up a bit more after 3 hours.This time, there were a lot of renovations going on at the Bloomingdale end and we came out from our elevator to walk through construction tunnels to get to the major shops.The area of the high end European Designer shops were fine. There were very few shoppers about this afternoon. Quite a change from the very busy Westfield at Culver City not so far away.We only did window shopping on this occasion, as my wife having already done some shopping in Europe where prices are lower at the current exchange rate with the Euro and the tax refund on leaving Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HL314
40,Has most of what you need,Array of shops gives you everything from cheap to luxury items.When I visited they where doing renovations that meant that there was no food court.But still a great place to go shopping I Beverly Hills. Atleast for the mid range pricing shops.Clean and nice which also makes it very laidback and nice imo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abeltur
40,Under renovation,"Nice upmarket indoor mall. Has all the popular brand stores but be warned, this is not a mall for bargain hunting. The food court could be better but hopefully after the construction work finishes the variety should be better. The car park has a great view of LA & for a tourist looking to past a couple of hours then go check out this Beverly Hills mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamlin72
40,Mall With Upscale Stores!,"The Beverly Center has transformed from a basic mall with chain stores to a place for the up-scale shopper with Gucci, Prada, LV stores etc. The dining level with fast food places has been re-placed with higher priced food establishments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8824NMalessandram
20,Really? That's all you got?,"Clean and nice but for shopping... I think you can do better. It's very very high end (outrageously pricey) or teeny bopper (cheap and trend of season-ish). Nothing in between for regular people. I was really wanting to shop, but nothing appealed to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/866marthaj
30,Went here with family,"The center was still under construction and you had to travel up like 5 escalators to reach the top. All the shops were very expensive as you may of guessed but there was nothing 'special about the place' neither but it did suit my reason of going in it, superdry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DcVsMarvel
20,Shopping under the scaffolding,The Beverly center is undergoing construction at this time. It is not a pleasant shopping experience during this phase. You are walking under scaffolding from place to place in dark hallways to get from the parking garage. It seems that the anchor stores such as Macys and Bloomingdales have been reduced to miniatures of themselves during construction. I really wouldn't bother until they re-open to their normal selves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atadfussy
40,Good for shopping,Shopped here in August and the mail is being redesigned and lots of building works going on but still able to find the stores we were looking for and plenty of range of shops on offer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
30,Just your average mall,"Yes the mall is huge and they are adding more stores. But if you are looking for things to do on your trip to Hollywood that isn't shopping keep moving.Parking is $1 the first hour and then it charges every 15 minutes. I believe it caps at $17, but I wasn't there that long.If you love shopping then this is a good place for you. There are tons of stores in the Center and even more across the street. The mall is clean and so is the parking structure,.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monkebones
50,This mall is huge & still growing!,"We went here to pick up one of my brother's birthday gifts. There are so many phenomenal stores & boutiques! And to think, they are still adding on to this beautifully-made building! Several stores had signs up that said, ""Coming Soon 2017""). An actual person is located nearby to guide & to answer any questions you might have in reference to the location of any store at the Beverly Center. What a great experience!Ashli H. ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40ashlih
50,Shopping,"Best place to shop, many type of shops you can find.There is a shop called ""Love Culture"" that has women and girls clothing that are on trend and in good quality also in valued prices. Should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hessamk
50,Shopping Galore,"We have seen it in the movies, and while knocking out all of the tourist attractions had to make a stop since we were in the area. It is a nice mall, with plenty of unique stores. The parking was easy, and we did find a few gifts to bring back to the kids. It was not too busy, but the time of year we hit L.A. does help when you're trying to do the whole tourist thing. It is much more enjoyable to go to Orlando or L.A. when the kids are in school so you have less mobs to deal with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,Quick and Easy Shopping,"We valet and went to a store and left. In and out in under 1 hr. It was easy access from valet to the elevators. $7 valet for under 2 hr and the stores with validate with a purchase. The store selections here are good if you are looking for brands but after a store or two, your rent/mortgage for the month maybe be depleted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bac0ngf
40,Good for the designer shops,This must be the same place to come as a tourist to LA if you want the designer stores. Anchored by Bloomingdales and Macy's this centre has an excellent selection of stores.Car park is huge with easy access to the shopping centre.My complaint is the construction work means shoppers are sent down long corridors that are in desperate need of air conditioning. I hope this doesn't last too much longer.The shopping centre will definitely be a nice place to visit once construction work is complete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271MarkW
10,overrated,I expected it to be filled with cafes and restaurants but it was too limited. They only had one crowded Starbucks and one restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryamA1212
30,It is a Huge Shopping Center. Move on.,"Beverly Center is crowded and quite large. It is an indoor shopping center. I have no idea why you would go there while traveling in Los Angeles. The eateries are for the most part chains, the stores are the same stores you will likely find at home. If you want to shop go to Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills, park at Nieman's--buy something there and get free parking and then walk the street. That is fun.Beverly Center is a mall. There is not one thing special about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,"Okay shopping center, not all shops I expected","Partially in reconstruction, surprisingly empty even on weekends (people probably spread out due its size), doesn't have all the average shops, more on the expensive side. Another part of the shopping center across the street, couple restaurants as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/articok
30,Shopping Mall,"Used to be a busy mall to shop not any more. Lots of shops to see, in door so air conditioning during the summer is great, ask the concierge for store sales and discounts before shopping. Parking is decent and not expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrinvankeulen
50,OMG what a mall!,"This place is amazing! It's a lil on the upscale side but it's very clean, sophisticated, nice stores, great parking.Even the bathrooms and the changing rooms are fantastic. Security is vigilant and the staff is friendly and professional.I loved the fact that some of my favorite stores were located in this mall so for me it was all about convenience :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenoritaBlackBarbie
30,Good but Changing,This mall has become more high end. If that is what you like then this is the spot. This use to be a more normal mall with a variety of price points. That mall is gone.They do have a good Macy's. But it to is in transition. I used to come to this mall regularly now I come here less.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonwsimmons
20,Over rated and way dated,Don't bother a special place this is not its just another tragic out dated mall. Truly nothing special here. It's got a few high high end designer the rest was just a few sneaker stores. Was very dark inside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660samueld
40,All in one,All the nice and popular shops where you need them! Great Center with a mixture of upscale and affordable shops. I also enjoyed the food court.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzielicious
50,Large shopping center,This is a large shopping center located conveniently in West Hollywood. It has a lot of upmarket shops. Best time to shop is when the center opens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kozwotsit
30,Chaotic & Claustrophobic,"Dark, difficult to navigate. After we entered the Beverly Center, we spent most of our time trying to leave. With others as frustrated as we were, we found navigating the escalators and elevators almost impossible. It's hard to imagine this mall as ever having any appeal for serious shoppers. Perhaps, once shoppers have an established route, this place is manageable. We felt so claustrophobic in this mall, after we left we stayed on the street and continued our shopping in street-side boutiques.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
10,Dire,"If you are a seasoned shopper, there are many, many more attractive places to shop there here. For Australians, or those that have travelled there, this is like a Westfield shopping mall, but 20-30 years ago, before any of the contemporary renovations. It's a tired, dated centre, that is gloomy and unglamorous. Unless there was a very specific shop you wanted to visit, avoid and go elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CNMItravels
50,High End shopping center,"This a huge shopping mall in Beverly Hills where all high end stores are there like Chanel, Tiffany, Cartier, Gucci to name s few plus a lot of boutiques etc. There are a lot of restaurants and a food court. The whole place is very clean and if you are a tech enthusiast there is a huge apple store in the center. It is a nice place to stop in for browse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulettea621
40,Dissapointing that they no longer have the food court,"Was very disappointed to see that the Beverly Centre no longer has a food court, since our last visit the centre has had a refurb and is a little more upmarket with stores and restaurants then when it was more a ""Westfield"" centre. Opposite the Sofitel Hotel its convenient, but really feel that to lose the food court was a shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheryll
20,Old mall that has most things but food,"Big mall in LA. But, it has NO restaurants or cafes. They will guide you to restaurants outside if you want to eat. That's odd, that a huge mall doesn't have any inside.The mall looks very tired and old. Needs some new pampering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/independent888
50,Great place to shop,Clean with easy parking access. Great stores. Nice department stores as well. Nice restaurants and cafes. I would have lied to spend more time here. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
30,Nice Mall,Mall was really nice. Decent selection of shops. Claimed they were an 8 story mall but only 3-4 stories were shops and the rest was parking. Most of the shops were for higher class people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegrizz88
40,Great place to shop,A beautifully airconditioned shopping centre with a great view from the escalators to the hills beyond. Offers a variety of shops from Bloomingdales to Macy's and lots in between.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohsevenphive
40,Good selection of shops,"A nice indoor mall with lots of shops. I was pleased to find a Bath & Body Works after searching everywhere! It is also easy to access and has a multi-storey car park so I reckon that parking would be fairly simple.There is a large Macy's as well, along with a range of other clothes shops too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeth87
30,Average shopping mall,You would expect an amazing mall because of its name. But its not. Its just average shopping mall. There were literally no people on weekday. It was dry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deepakbansal2000
50,Excellent place,Our visit to this place was excellent tour visiting mall and as whole area. We enjoy and highly recommend for exclusive shopping with wonderful arrangements for the people whose priorities are top class than money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogendrar740
10,Security Guards,"Beverly Center consists of two windowless levels of shops on top of a five-level parking garage. Mall security creates an atmosphere similar to that of the shopping area in an airport terminal.On a recent visit to Beverly Center I was harassed repeatedly by security guards for doing nothing more than writing some personal travel notes. LA is loaded with malls and shopping districts (The Grove, Westfield Century City,Montana Avenue, Robertson Boulevard to name but a few) that are worth your time and money. Beverly Center is not one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657alanz
40,Indoor Shopping Option,Very nice shopping mall within a wide range of stores with varying price points. Something for all budgets there. Parking is easy and the layout is simple to navigate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess123182
20,Just another shopping mall,Just another shopping mall. Known brand shops with not much choice for restaurant. Won't come back unless i need last minute shopping,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliep1610
40,shop till you drop,"visited to kill some time on our last day in LA AND TO GET OUT OF THE hot and humid day.What surprise.A very clean and beautiful shopping center.All the best store from Armani,Macy's,Bloomfield's and even a pleasing surprise ,a Lorna Jane store,a bit of Aussie in this massive City.WE shopped up a storm with all the specials on and a stall everywhere where very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/654SteveR
30,"Nothing spectacular, just average",Not a large mall but it has space inside and confused layout typical of a large mall. Food venues were very limited inside. With that it packs the cosy feeling. Yes many high and middle end shops. Some still being opened. There is a Bloomingdale and Macy's but it's a medium sized department store. So didn't have all the brands and trends like the SanFrancisco union square one.When we did try to look for a balanced place go eat we found California Pizza Kicthen along the road side of the mall.Would I want to visit this mall again. Not really except for one or max two boutique stores.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pt2pt3
50,Go ahead and splurge a little :),Great place to go shopping when staying at the Beverly Hilton! Has all the major retail chains and high end designers as well. Go browse and there's 3 or 4 levels. Restaurants on site and a Fatburger right across the street!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robakapayback
30,Busy but good - $$$ park,Parking is a nightmare and you will pay for it. Only the restaurants will validate and nomen of the shops. My biggest pet peeve is paying to park when I am already given money to the mall. Ridiculously arrogant in my opinion. That's the problem (among many) with LA: paying too park even at grocery stores. Just awful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllTryAnythingTwice1
20,Strange place - one to avoid,"Really odd experience - empty place with lots of designer shops, a few high street options and a big Bloomingdales and Macys. Very few eating options, generally disappointing and far better alternatives abound (The Grove / Westfied / 3rd Street Promenade). I'll never return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricWhite74
30,Nice Variety,"This mall contains both expensive and affordable clothing so there is something for everyone.The parking is quite cheap, about $3 so shop till your heart's content.This was a pit stop since it was on the way to hotel.Just remember where you parked and you'll be fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxD87
40,Nice Selection of Stores in Vertical Mall,"I walked to this mall because I had passed it several times and wondered what was inside. It is a nice collection of upscale specialty stores such as Victorinox, Coach, and Stuart Weitzman anchored by Bloomingdale's and Macy's. The anchor stores also seemed to have nice options for shopping. I just bought a foundation in a shade that was unavailable at home. The sales people in all the stores I visited were welcoming. I had lunch at a mozzarella bar in the center of the mall and it was a nice selection of organic greens topped with free range chicken.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharronH379
50,Safe and comfortable luxury shopping at the Beverly Centre,"Great shopping Centre, all the luxury shops, staying close by enables you to shop till you drop then take your packages to the hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecO7889FG
30,"As expected - high end, crowded","If you're a shopaholic or even just love window shopping, this place is pretty good. But it can get crowded at times, adding to the difficulty of navigating the place. Lots of well-known, high-end shops with some mid-range stores thrown in. It's an enormous building but only the top two floors are shopping (lower floors are parking garage).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crusadercc
30,Great for shopping and not much as else,"I decided to check out the Beverly center because of a few recommendations from a few of my friends. I was already staying in the area, so I figured I'd give it a shot. The shopping is good; a wide selection of everything from high end brands (Fendi and even Prada) to Macy's (which has an outstanding male selection) and other moderately priced stores. That being said, aside from finding a nice Calvin Klein blazer, there wasn't much as to do at Beverly. Nice gallery for stores, but only a few places to eat aside from some high end restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawno718
50,One stop shop for everything from affordable to high end,"Spacious, clean and accessible. Stores are varied from affordable for the cost conscious to the mid-expensive for the fashionista. Best to go mid-week as the weekend crowds can make the place quite congested. Worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cohuna
20,MAULED!,"A monolithic, remarkably uninviting edifice that immediately makes you feel like you are being trapped inside a level of Hades. The food court is little more than lots of street vendors clamoring for attention. There was once a movie theater in the complex, but it was so claustrophobic that one would been better off watching a film in LA Country Jail.Don't be surprised it the place is torn down in the very near future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElOsoTerrible
20,Hardly worth the visit really,"I don't remember previously that this place was, for want of a better word...rubbish. I does have 2 levels but hardly any shops. There are a few Designer shops, a few places to eat and a large Forever 21 and H&M..there's a Macy's ...other than that...nothing. Also, it's incredibly difficult to navigate...they offer an International discount voucher booklet, but it's not very useful. Strange, I just don't remember it being like this in previous years..try across the street at The Beverly Connection, it's like a mini outlet mall with Old Navy, TJ Maxx and Marshall's discount stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldwide002
40,Hollywood shopping,Top mall to go to if you are in Hollywood. Easy to get to by public transport. Macy's is the store especially if they have a sale on. We have had big discounts in Kenneth Cole.

40,"Beautiful Mall, if you have lots of money!",I have been to many malls and this is a beautiful one. It is similar to the Mall of Dubai but not as glamorous. All the designer stores are here so it's great to look but probably not to buy. There weren't as many eateries as I expected and I ended up at Starbucks which wasn't even in it's own unit but is just a stall with chairs and tables in the middle of the mall. They do have Bloomingdales and Macy's but it's not the same as visiting these classic stores in NY.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovechocolate

Taking up a full block, the mall is also near the highly regarded Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and is not too far from the Pacific Design Center. There is ample parking in the Beverly Center's covered parking structure. If you live more than fifty miles away, you may want to stop first at ""Guest Services"" in the mall to pick up a free ""Shopping Passport"" which offers special discounts and other shopping offers. The mall features department stores such as Macy's and Bloomingdales and more than one hundred other popular individual stores such as Salvatore Ferragamo, Tiffany & Co., Prada, Fendi, Gucci, and Versace Collection. There are also nice restaurants. ""Yeah, uh huh"", there is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13

50,They Walk Among Us,"When visiting Los Angeles with my 20-something daughter, I knew I had to take her to the legendary Beverly center so she could experience firsthand what big city mall browsing was all about. It didn't disappoint. She really enjoyed the spectacular views of Los Angeles from the expansive windows and was doubly excited to catch a glimpse of celebrity athletes, musicians, models and stars of television and motion pictures, escaping the ordinary, by casually shopping or having a lunchtime bite to eat. First class customer service without a hint of snobbery or puffery. She loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilkinsk2013
40,Lots of mid to high end shopping,"Tons of Mid to high end shopping stores. Good location to walk around. Clean area easy to navigate to and from. Macys was clean compared to some that I have been in. There is a Nordstrom Rack across the street as well as Marshalls/TJ Maxx. Mall was not overlay crowded, however that could have been due to time and that the president was in town. Took a bit to get there due to road closures from the president's visit. Good place to spend the evening and get dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/219AnnaL

The staff are truly beautiful souls who made every purchase a delight. We took home some precious buys that will always remind us of the Beverly Center. The restaurants in the mall are few but there is plenty to eat at the ones around. We went back on our last day in Beverly Hills to shop some more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774AmandaG

50,West coast fashion in the heart of LA.,"This mall is one of our favorite shopping places to visit. Nice stores, easy parking and we always get something that is different from east coast stores. It is often crowded but if you go at right time it will work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronp768
30,"Well, it's better than the Grove ? And closer than South Coast.","Hmmm.. Beverly Center is the ""fanciest"" mall in LA. They have a lot of new or renovated European designer boutiques. Gucci. Prada. Fendi. Versace. Louis Vuitton. And a big Forever 21. And a mediocre Bloomingdales. And a nice Macy's (really nice men's store). They have closed the food court for a remodel now so there are very few food choices here. Somehow the whole thing seems like the Pompeidu Center had a baby with a crappy mall and left it in the 80s. If you want European designers.. go to Rodeo. If you want Bloomingdales best - go to Century City. If you want Macy's best go to South Coast Plaza. Although the Macy's Men's store at Bev is probably the best thing about the mall and is worth the trip. Oh and I like Henri Bendel for last minute gifts.. The candles are great and unisex. You will see minor celebs..but go to Robertson for better celeb sighting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarriorla
30,Service with no smile,"It is slick and it is popular, but it is not enjoyable to shop there for luxury goods, even though the merchandise is great. These folks do not understand service and clearly, most of the shoppers aren't there expecting it. Everyone who thinks Rodeo Drive is overrated needs to just compare the service experience between the two. The merchandise (and the prices) are identical. I would rather be treated with consideration rather than being rushed in and out and then being charged for parking. Rodeo? 3 hours free. They get it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfdann

40,Nice mall,This is a nice mall in L.A. as there are a lot of great stores like luxury brands but also the store Macy's is here.

The shops carry less merchandise than their street-side stores in other areas of town, everything sold in the mall stores is marked up at least 30%, the food is horrible and the security guards have a John Wayne complex when they approach in groups of five or more.I grew up in LA and I know this town better than any other town on earth and I promise you a horrible experience at the Bev Center.

50,"WOW, MY HEAD IS STILL SPINNING!","AWESOME, The one word I would use to describe the Beverly Center. This Center has every store that you may have dreamt of going to. This is definitely a high-end ritzy place to be,the best stores one could ask for. Be prepared to do a lot of window shopping because these are not your typical affordable stores( although they may be for most Los Angeles people:-)). There is Luxury all around this area and is second to Rodeo Drive, although there are more stores and you may or may not find a SALE sign every now and then in some of the stores. After visiting the Beverly Center you may wonder if you might want a career change just to be able to afford these wonderful items of fashion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brightsmile1
50,A Wonderful Shoping Experience!,"The Beverly Center is worth visiting, shopping, relaxing at bars or eateries, ""just looking"" and if one has time, spending hours at the mall. There are the high end shops such as Bloomingdale's, Louis Vuitton, Micheal Kors, Prada, Tiffany and Co., and many, many more. If one's budget requires shopping in typical mall stores, there also are plenty of stores in which to shop. It, however, doesn't cost $$ to walk around and visit any store, regardless of the price of merchandise. Each level has its' own ambiance and stores to match. I very much enjoyed my lunch at Obika Mozzarella Bar (level 6). The service and food were quite good. I ordered a salad of grilled organic vegetables and enjoyed every morsel. It was too early for me to enjoy an alcoholic beverage, however, I will return for a bigger meal and a beverage to match!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roxymusic4

I went to Bloomingdales first, they had no athletic shoes unless you count wedges (salesman suggested some athletic looking shoe/wedge hybrid) or metallic coach shoes obviously for styling and not running. Next I tried Macy's which was a horrible mess, it took nearly 10 min to try on my first pair, then I finally gave up and asked the sales person to bring me a 7 in these Pumas that I saw on the floor and that I would take them home without trying them on because I can see at the pace that they were moving that it would take alot longer than I wanted to spend at Macy's. I take the shoes home and with horror realize they gave me UK7 which is a US 10. What a terrible waste of a good shopping day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ybyhy
