50,"THE EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY OF EARLY CALIFORNIANS - SPANIARDS, MEXICANS, AMERICANS, INDIANS, MULATOS, AND MESTISOS","Well hidden between I-605 and the San Gabriel River bed, south of Whittier Blvd and with access from Pioneer Blvd, the PIO PICO STATE HISTORIC PARK preserves the Pio Pico Adobe (a mansion in its day) on the site of the original El Ranchito. As the last Governor of the Californian Territories known as Alta California, Pio Pico, an African-Mexican, was a prominent figure in the development of the settlement known as “El Pueblo Sobre el Rio de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Angeles del Río de Porciúncula”, later shortened to Los Angeles.Most interestingly, persons of African heritage enter the northwestern region of Colonial Mexico as early as the mid-1600s. Their “Mexican” descendants were racially mixed, consisting of Indians, Mulatos,Mestizos, and other persons of mixed caste were actually the majority population in the Mexican northwest. From this region came the original settlers of Alta California who came north with Captain Juan Bautista de Anza, between 1774 and 1776. This region also produced the original settlers of Los Angeles.Pío Pico (1801-1894) is perhaps the most celebrated Afro-Mexican in California history. He was an owner of huge rancho properties and a prominent resident of Los Angeles. His parents and grandparents came with the Anza party from Sinaloa, where two-thirds of the residents were mulattoes (one white parent and one black or partially black parent). His younger brother, Andrés Pico was a wealthy landowner and military commander during the Mexican era. Under United States rule he became a member of the State Constitutional Committee, General of the State Militia and California State Senator.Explore this amazing history of the people who created Los Angeles.
