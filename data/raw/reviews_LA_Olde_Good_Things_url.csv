40,Interesting but mostly larger scale fixtures,"I was hoping this would be a vintage antique collectibles store based on the signage but it was not that. But the store is packed with old items such as doors, window panes, light fixtures, old equipment, and interesting old items. But donâ€™t expect to see smaller collectibles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernBelles98
10,Review of your Scranton Pa Location,"OMG !!!!!!!! This warehouse is packed floor to ceiling with anything you can imagine.Doors, windows, light fixtures, fireplace mantels, sheet upon sheets of tin, ceramic tiles, mirrors, chairs anything you can imagine that can be reclaimed. Problem is that NOTHING is priced. You'll need to search this enormous facility in hope of finding someone who works there. In turn the person goes into an office and emerges with a price that is ridiculous. Really ? $25 for a piece of 8"" x 8"" ceramic tile? $400 for a 3' x 3' UNFRAMED mirror? At first glance it looked like a truly amazing place only to be shattered by the lack of and (when discovered) Grossly overpriced reclaimed items. Neat place to look around but don't expect to buy anything",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeNadine
