40,Call Ahead,"First, if you plan to visit this museum, the hours can be unpredictable. The first time we tried to visit was a holiday weekend and the people who run the museum do catering and are usually busy elsewhere on holiday weekends. The second time we tried to visit, it wasn’t open but the back room was being loaned for a meeting but someone took pity on us and let us in. Eventually someone from the museum showed up and opened.With that out of the way, we really enjoyed seeing the museum. The people were very nice and informative. The small museum is filled with small exhibits and artifacts regarding local San Gabriel history. Not everything is small, there is a carriage in the front room. In the corner is a children’s activity center. Among the small exhibits are: old Sears catalogues, manual typewriter, hardware and blacksmith, a smudge pot (I remember these while growing up in the San Fernando Valley when it still had orange trees), housewares, candle making, Native American grinding stones, how to make adobe bricks. There are a number of small exhibits in two rooms.There is a small parking lot behind and street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

30,Interesting collection of California artifacts,"We visited the Ramona Museum after visiting the nearby Mission San Gabriel. I wouldn't suggest going to San Gabriel just for the Ramona Museum, but if you are in the neighborhood, it's free and worth a stop. It has an interesting collection of artifacts and photographs. There were only a few other visitors the day we were there, and we got a guided tour from a member of the organization that runs the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catonsviller
