50,Small brewery to visit while in Long Beach,Great small space to try a few brews. Only downside was how many kids were in there for the holidays. Enjoyed trying thendifferent styles they had there and the bartenders were very friendly and attentive. If in the area you should definitely try this place out and support local Long Beach.,Chase V
40,Hidden away spot worth the stop if you are in the area,This is a strip center brewery on a side street by the Long Beach airport. I probably would not have noticed it but for the pump jack logo (disclosure: I work in that industry). They had a good selection of small batch craft beers and some cool oilfield memorabilia as decor. Good placement of the TVs for watching football or baseball.,BryanMichaelC
50,Surprising Find,"I just happened to stumble upon this little gem while looking for a bite to eat. Small batch beer place while I catch some of the game? Sure! The staff was awesome. The owner is a down to Earth beer lover who will chat you up while you sip your selections. The place has ore of a coffee shop ""hipster"" type of vibe rather than a typical brew pub. The beer was great, the patrons were friendly and Ieft looking forward to my next visit to Long Beach so I can come back. Definitely.",Blubusdrvr
30,Hazy IPA no Bueno,"Recently opened & crowded (limited seating, around 33 seats). They plan on expanding into neighboring vacant business. While they don't serve food you can bring food in, many did. Dogs. As other businesses open up parking could become an issue. We were there on Sunday and front parking was full after we parked.They had 5 brews on tap & tried them all. The Hazy IPA was horrible ... everyone hated it!! The other 4 brews were average and nothing special. They say the Grasshopper IPA was very popular. Brew is $7-8 a pint; $4-5 for half a pint. Overpriced for average brew.",baaaaaaa
