40,A needle in a haystack - just outside of Los Angeles,In Los Angeles finding an inexpensive pair of harem pants and other cotton items from India is like finding a needle in a haystack . . . that is until you come to Pioneer Blvd in Artesia and stop in at this little store. I was so happy! I bought harem pants and cotton head bands and I want to go back and by some household linens from them. It was just a bit crowded and hot today so my first visit was short. Oh by the way the price is totally right. If you like items from India and can't get to India this is the place to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephine1996
