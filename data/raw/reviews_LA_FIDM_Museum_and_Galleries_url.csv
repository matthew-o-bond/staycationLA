40,A good place for fashion lovers,This is a good place to go for those who love fashion and the movies! They have a rotating collection of costumes from films as well as showcasing the work of students. They also have a collection of period costumes. You can get a little turned around as to wear to start and rooms to see. The gift shop also has pieces from students as well as other knickknacks. Maybe take an hour to see it all. Not a ton of parking cause it’s in the middle of downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybO6789RN
40,Good for people into Fashion/History or touring DTLA,Check website to see what is currently going on. Three Small(ish) rooms and an interesting Gift Shop. The Displays are temporary. There is a small park outside and many other DTLA attractions nearby. So one could make this part of a full day downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Small but mighty!,"An excellent museum, especially since one of the exhibits showcased costumes from the Academy Awards nominees. While you're clearly not allowed to touch any of the garments on display, you could see all the detail up close. I especially enjoyed seeing the Mary Poppins costumes that looked as if they're painted. So cool! Staff was exceptionally welcoming and gracious, which I don't usually get when visiting museums. Free admission was an unexpected plus! If you've got an hour or so, drop by. It's well worth it and then get lunch at the Grand Central Market, which is about a 5 minute drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickieW302
50,Annual academy award exhibit,This is the 4th year that I’ve attended the Academy Awards costumes exhibits. It’s fun to see the detail in the outfits up close and personal. I also love that the exhibit is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/559carlaj
50,So cool and under an hour,"What a great museum and you can do it all in under an hour. There is a nice park outside, too. Movie costume exhibit was great. Admission is free. There’s only one bathroom with a long line so don’t plan on using facilities here. I’d recommend this museum if you’re looking to spend just an hour. Exhibits are very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RumRunner01
40,Saw a Fab 'Outstanding Art of Television Costume' Display. Free! Stopped By After Visiting The Nearby Grammy Museum.,"We swung by the FIDM Museum and Galleries after first visiting the Grammy Museum, a few blocks away. We were pleasantly surprised by what was on display -- ""The 12th Outstanding Art of Television Costume Design"". (Displays change regularly, so check their web site).I was delighted to see costumes from a few shows I watch (Outlander and The Crown) as well as many others I've heard of like Game of Thrones, Star Trek Discovery and Westworld). The museum/gallery isn't huge, but it's free and the costumes are of high quality. You're allowed to take photos.In a separate area, there is a Napoleonic Court Gown on display, as well as a small but quality gift shop selling jewelry, books and souvenirs.Besides the nearby Grammy Museum (Part of the ""L.A. Live"" complex), you'll also find the Staples Center, Microsoft Theater and a small mall and eateries at Fig and 7th. Don't let anybody tell you nobody walks in L.A. -- that area is very walkable!If you found this review useful, please click the 'thank' button. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfr
50,You will appreciate fashion and costuming a lot more after visiting!,"I lived across from FIDM for a year and never went. Partially because they didn't open the FIDM Museum until the year after I moved. If you haven't been, GO! The exhibits are so much better up close and personal so you can see all the painstaking detail! I can't wait to return for their Academy Award-nominated costume display!AND they have a museum store that everyone in my life can just go here if you ever need gift ideas for me. They also have an amazing sample clothing and shoe store and jewelry store where you can get great pieces for way less than they are worth!#FIDM #lindaandstevenplochocki #exhibition #makesmewander",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderwithsarah
40,Worth a quick visit,The FIDM Museum and Galleries is a free attractive by FIDM in downtown Los Angeles. You can visit the attraction in no time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsthetravelguy
30,Enjoyed Grand Hope Park out front....,If you are into what they display you will like it.I could not care less.What I really liked was the beautiful park in front of FIDM. Very attractive and a place to sit and relax and stay cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/differentname
40,Free and quick visit - pleasantly surprised,"Visited with wife and 11yo daughter. No real interest in fashion but staying nearby and dropped in to fill in some time. Very pleasantly surprised.Well presented display of actual costumes from current popular TV shows. It was the week of the Emmy's and they also had free popcorn, chocolates and lemonade.Free entry, no crowds, well done display, in and out in 30min. If you are in the area definitely worth a visit.The venue has a decent gift shop with unusual pieces, samples store and relaxing garden all attached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
50,Gorgeous costumes!,Wow! This is by far my favorite costume exhibit I've seen in a very long time! It was so neat to see movie costumes up close and in person. Better still they weren't behind glass and difficult to see against museum lighting!!! It's a shame that they don't have this exhibit around longer than a few months but it was well worth it and free! I will make it a point to visit annually to see what other gems they show off in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009
50,Free museum for fahionistas and movie lovers,"Exhibits change every few months and range from costumes used in oscar movies to fashion collections of the famous. Two great shops as well...the museum store with books and interesting gifts and jewelry, some one of a kind items. And around the corner is an entirely different store stocked with donations from the fashion and rag industry where students come to find the raw materials for their projects. You'll find finished fashion donated by various well-known stores as well as buttons, bolts of cloth, etc. Cheap fun! Take the blue line..no hassles with traffic or parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417kittyk
50,A great little museum - and it's free,I went to see the movie costume exhibition. The clothes were from recent movies (nominated for this season's OSCARs) and you could get close to them (ie actually see them).This was the main focus of the museum and I would definitely go back to see another exhibition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda_UK_2015
50,Take the docent tour and shop at FIDM Scholarship Store,"My club took a docent tour of the campus. Very interesting! The school, located in a 5 story building at Grand and 9th has 28 majors all related to fashion, design and marketing. Throughout the campus building, there are displays. Our docent covered all 5 floors and talked about the school and the fashion industry in general. Who knew there is a college degree in window displays?? The school has a museum, which was closed the day we visited. I will return. It also has a scholarship store. Designer goods, donated to benefit the school, are sold pennies on the dollar. Well worth a visit by itself. Panini's is located nearby for lunch. Tour lasted 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
40,See fashion for free,"This is a small museum in downtown LA, as part of the FIDM school. It's in a nice building in a nice businessy area of downtown. And oh yeah, admission is FREE! If you like fashion, even just a little, I would recommend visiting. Check online to see what exhibits are on display before you go. I wish there was more info to read about the clothing in the TV costumes exhibit that we saw. The mens attire exhibit was a great little show. It's a nice digestible size, doesn't take all day to see everything. Would def return the next time I'm in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishmosh_1
50,An Inexpensive Way to Spend a Fabulous Afternoon,"We visited Los Angeles the weekend of the Emmy Awards so we went to FIDM to see the exhibit of Emmy nominated costumes. The exhibit was fabulous. The costumes have so much more detail that doesn't come across on TV but helps the actor get into character. As I walked the exhibit, I decided to watch several shows I hadn't seen based on their costumes. In at least one instance I want to see why a character would be dressed in such a costume! I had to find out.FIDM has convenient parking underneath the building. The museum is free and has three rooms with rotating exhibits. You can check their website for the schedule. However, make sure to search for the FIDM ""Museum"" or you will get the design school. We visited FIDM on a Saturday which is open until 5:00. After noon on Saturdays, there is no parking attendant so the parking is free. This made for an inexpensive way to spend a fabulous afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckaul2016
40,"Interesting visit. Very small, will only take one hour.",My daughter wanted to visit this place. It was extremely interesting as it was full of costumes used for films and TV. It was small with a large number of staff who were really helpful. Nice location and peaceful surroundings in the middle of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stennyhouse
50,FIDM FASHIONABLE.,"During my trip, I signed my daughter up for a fashion workshop at FIDM. She learned so much as she always wanted to be a fashion designer when she was going to grow up so it was perfect for her. We got the opportunity to tour the museum and it was quite entertaining. We saw several designer works, models, and portfolios. The showcase was professionally set up mannequins, costumes, and props. If you happen to stop by at FIDM or just interested in the works of fashion, take this gallery a peek!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seabreezesakka
50,"Calling all Fastionistas, Aspiring Costume Designers and Lovers of Fashion History","A downtown LA attraction that should be on your list if you are one of the above. The first time I visited FIDM, it was with my son, who was doing a double major at UCLA that included Costume Design. It was after the year's Oscars and winners were represented in a fabulous exhibition. To be so close to the over-the-top costumes that one could otherwise only see on the screen. There is an interesting gift shop, but the bonus is the ""store"" next door that offers clothes, jewelry, fabric etc of FIDM students. I've found some amazing things that are one of a kind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel
50,Beautiful displays,I had always wanted to visit the FIDM museum and finally went today for a small and beautifully staged fan exhibit. Only one room but well worth the visit. Metered street parking was readily available on Saturday. Admission free. Lovely gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,A Treasure Trove for Movie and Fashion Lovers,"This museum is a wonderful secret, situated in the heart of downtown LA, that needs to be shared and explored especially if you love fashion and movies. Every year the Annual Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibit is housed here from February to April. It is free and showcases the wardrobe of movies made the previous year. This year was particularly special because it featured costumes from the latest Star Wars saga. When we showed up there were also live Stormtroopers to herald in the excitement....Next door in a smaller venue is the historical garments exhibit and it usually shows period clothing or accessories in all its finest flair. Have a chat to the museum guards and usually they can give you some tidbits of valuable information regarding the items on display.The gift shop is a great last minute stop to find a beautiful gift or memento commemorating your time there.Oh and around the corner is FIDM's student discount store selling garments and yards of fabric from sample sales. A must for any fashion bargain hunter needing to indulge in more retail therapy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edenrox10
50,It is worth your attention,"A small exhibition of costumes made for filming, but worth a visit that would realize how different what we see in the movies from reality. I was impressed as merely look costumes of the latest Star Wars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9vasyln
50,Real gem of an exhibition space,"A free gallery (donations accepted, but not aggressively sought), that showcases fashion -- typically costumes associated with movies. The current main exhibit has costumes from about 15 movies of 2015, from Star Wars to The Revenant to the Danish Girl and Cinderella. Beautifully displayed and not crowded so plenty of time to look at style, construction, fabrics, etc. A secondary exhibit has a wonderful collections of fans with some of the dresses that were worn in the heyday of fan use. While there, be sure to check out the museum shop (fantastic) and the FIDM Scholarship store, which has designer/manufacturer donations of samples and minor seconds for fantastic prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intl_bus
50,Free!,"Heard about the costume display from past and current Oscar award nominated films. Terrific, as well as one displaying fans and period gowns and dresses from turn of the century! Check website for info on current exhibits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbB2000
50,Always an interesting exhibit!,"A well-known jewel that has gratis entry to all of their fashion, film/TV costume shows! Wow, how can you go wrong? They host the annual ""Academy Awards film costume exhibit (February/March) and also the Emmy (TV) costume show (July/August)...pretty much the same time slots each year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rug-girl
40,A hidden treasure,"The Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising museum is a little known treasure in a rather obscure location in downtown Los Angeles. Frequently referred to as FIDM, which says little about the place, it contains changeable displays of fashion. I was there part of a private event and on display were many Academy Award designs from recent movies. The web site will say more about the place and what is on display at any particular time. I'm sure this place will be of interest to anyone interested in fashion of today or years past. It is located on the ground floor of a high-rise in downtown L.A. Check out the location on a map or GPS before going. There was valet parking when I was there. Don't know what is available the rest of the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pixer1
50,Hollywood Costume Sketches,"A really interesting display of rarely seen costume designs from various designers and different studios. Some designers actually drew a portrait of the star wearing the costume. Covers a wide range of years also. This is an art form that was not generally saved by the studios.The Museum also has a small exhibit of corsets, some quite early, as a fundraiser: you can adopt a corset!No photography permitted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruth250
30,Cool place to see but watch out for rude security guards,"This was very neat to see, but the security guards staff are so rude that it makes it a ~ only if you get there ~ NOT a must see. Its fairly short and wouldn't be worth it to just go see this so package it with some other sight seeing downtown, I will try again in a year or so to see if the people have decided to welcome donations and visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Always_Traveling7644
40,Costumers welcome!,"FIDM Museum and Galleries is worth a trip to anyone interested in costuming or fashion. Check the website before you go since there is a gap between shows when the museum shop will be open, but no exhibit installed. Sometimes the back Gallery has a show when the main museum is empty. If you are interested in costuming, try to visit in spring during the annual Academy Awards costuming exhibit. Other shows honor the Emmy's, historic garments from the collection, fashion and costume sketches, etc.Before or after the Museum, you can visit the Scholarship Shop for great bargains on fabrics, buttons, trims, jewelry and ready-to-wear clothing. There is a constantly changing stock donated to the school from designers and manufacturers. This is a non-profit store with all proceeds going to scholarships for FIDM students. Take a break by crossing the street to Whole Foods and pick up a salad or sandwich to eat in the FIDM park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112kathleeng
50,Great FREE Muesum,We've been here multiple times and it's always great! The set up is awesome. You can really see the detail in the costumes. Always worth the time to walk through it. The park that it sets next to is also nice. And free is always good:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyAdventures41
50,Definitely worth a trip if near downtown Los Angeles!,"This is one of those hidden gems that aren't usually written about in guidebooks, and even many locals don't know about, but it's well worth a visit - particularly if you're from out of town, but even if you're not, because this being the company town that it is, it's quintessential Los Angeles. It's an opportunity to get as close as you're probably ever going to get to the real tv/film industry.In the fall, FIDM features the actual costumes worn in many television programs, particularly those that are nominated for Best Costume Design for the Emmys. This year, that exhibit goes from July 30-October 19th. There are costumes from Games of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey (including the 2 wedding dresses from Season 3) and the winner of this year's Emmy: Behind the Candelabra. The detail and workmanship of all the costumes are amazing to see - just the sparkle off the sequins on the Liberace costumes are enough to power LA for about a year.In January or so (once the Oscar nominees are announced), FIDM also annually features the movie version of their fall exhibit. This time it highlights the movies up for Best Costume Design. Check out their website at: fidmmuseum.org for exact dates.The museum is not overwhelming: you can tour the primary exhibit and the other gallery in about an hour. And the exhibit is free. We always visit on a Saturday (closed on Sunday), and there seems to be plenty of on-street parking (50 cents for an hour: bring quarters).Two blocks down (at 7th/Grand) are some great lunch restaurants: either Louie's or Coco Laurent. Also next to the museum is the FIDM clothes shop. Lots of funky clothing/jewelry for very, very, very cheap prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miznina
40,amazing costume museum! bring your sketch book! (no cameras!),Just got back from a second trip to the FIDM museum and scholarship shop. The galleries had som e phenominal pieces from several of the current TV and movies we've seen and admired. Additionally there was an exibit of outstanding gowns and shoes they they are trying to acquire for thier permanent collection- unbelivevable things!!Afterwards we wandered over to the scholarship shop and found more fabulous bargains- I should have a beaded gown later this year- just for starters. something for most everyone over there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/act2redux
50,Wonderful!,"Wonderful exhibit of exquisite costumes from many award-winning/nominated films of 2012. Free admission + parking charges ($5 to park below the building.) Perfect girlfriends outing. Next to the film costumes exhibit is a small but equally wonderful display of dresses, hats, bonnets, jewelry from the 1800's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
40,very interesting place,We were at the FIDM for a cocktail and had great time. The galleries had a very interesting display of 2012-2013 Oscar movie dresses. The museum store was unique. A must place for movie and fashion lovers...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrWorldTraveler
50,Highly recommended for film buffs,"Just made our second visit to the FIDM museum. It such a great way to get an up close look at costumes worn in the movies. Last year it was 2012 Oscar nominated costumes (The Artist, Thor, Hugo, Hoover, W/E, Jane Eyre among others) and some historic costumes (like gowns worn by Marilyn Monroe & Marlene Dietrich, shoes worn by Fred Astaire ).This year it's 2012 Oscar nominated costumes. Some of the costumes we saw were from Lincoln, Django Unchained, The Avengers, A Royal Affair, Anna Karenina, Mirror, Mirror, The Hunger Games, and Snow White & the Huntsman. There was also a separate display of costumes from Skyfall. When you visit, bare in mind it's a small museum and it's free. There's no docent so you're on your own to walk around and look. We visited the exhibit in less than an hour. We went on a Saturday afternoon and didn't even have to pay for parking.While you're in the area, the LA Central Library is within walking distance (near 5th & Flower). Consider walking over and taking a look around this amazing building. As of this date, they offer a free guided tour Monday-Friday at 12:30 and two on Saturdays 11:00 and 2:00. It's well worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barb1wired
50,Great value for fashion and film lovers,"Current show is costumes from 2011 award winning movies. Great display along with historic costume pieces worn by the likes of Dietrich, Douglas, and Kelly. Great value since the show is free (donations accepted) and their parking garage only charged $5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseB22
50,"FIDM Museum , a secret jewel","This small museum changes it's exhibits regularly. This month it was a show called Fabulous. Many costumes displayed on mannequins,and all kinds of oddities that were actually vintage accessories in the side cases. My favorite was a purse made out of a whole peacock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msbrown5804
40,A best kept secret in LA.,"Last February I visited the Fashion Institute and Design Museum in downtown LA. It was absolutely fascinating. At that time (it was Academy Awards week), they displayed costumes from several movies like the Last Air Bender and Burlesque. Not only were the designs amazing but to see the actual sizes of the people wearing the costumes really put it into perspective. They change displays every 3-4 months and it only takes about 45 minutes to see. They also have a really cool gift shop with unique gifts. It will definitely be on my list of things to do the next time I'm in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandyjpa
