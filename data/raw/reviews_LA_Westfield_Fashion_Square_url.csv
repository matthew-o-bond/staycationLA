30,Nice for walking,"Unfortunately, there seems to be fewer people shopping in this mall. Macy’s, Starbucks, and the food court appear to be busy; however other stores (even designer stores) are not. It is a brightly lighted mall with ample parking so it’s a great place to walk (certainly not the intention of a fashion Mall).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,Great for a late night quick shop/ eat,"We went for my daughter desperately wanting a shopping fix as we arrived into LA as it was all under one roof , had free parking and was only a few minutes by car from our hotel. She shopped, we didn’t get lost and found our car easily afterwards and we got something to eat in the food court which had plenty of choice - we had Persian which was very good and great value. It shuts at 9pm so back to hotel not too late, after a long day of travelling.A lot of the usual type shops but handy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhJ1878CC
10,Starbucks,The cashier stole $10 from me by not adding the cash credit to my Starbucks credit card. After young lady cashier charged on my card she didn't add cash $10 into my card account?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warrenakop
