50,Great Place To Watch A Play,"My husband, young adult kids, and I went there last month to watch Famous, the Play. We had a Great Time from beginning to end! First of all, the play is fabulous and a Must-See! I'm hoping it extends past the end of the month so we can take friends and watch it again. The staff at The 11:11 are all fantastic, very friendly. The inside decor of the venue is a lot of fun to view. The place just has a great atmosphere. There's a parking lot across the street and restaurants at walking distance. We will definitely be visiting The 11:11 again.",Sara T
