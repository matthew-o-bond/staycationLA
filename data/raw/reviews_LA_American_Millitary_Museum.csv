50,American Military Museum,"this is an awesome museum to visit, open fri-sat and sunday.. Come check it out. very cool place to visit....highly recommeded it.",Sreng L
50,History that one can experience,This was such a great experience for young students studying history. The ability to walk through this area at their own pace while asking questions and viewing the actual equipment is amazing. The experience is much more meaningful than words and pictures in a book. The price is certainly affordable; and the people hosting this exhibit were very patient and helpful!,martys37
50,Hidden treasure,Lots of tanks...APC and artillery..naval guns. Great to see up close. Pricing is great. Takes about an hour to 90 minutes to check out. All outdoors so don't go when super hot.,Frank Y
20,You Must Be A Real Buff To Come Here!,"I don't get the attraction...this is just a collection of old military tanks, copters and stuff sitting out in the weather on a dirt parking lot like a used car lot. Nothing looks maintained in any condition or provided with any care or consideration that should be afforded our military heritage. You've got to be a serious buff or just run out of other sights to see to come here. I won't waste my time again.",HappyTraveler0109
40,Looks like a nice museum over the fence. But only open Saturday and Sunday,This museum is only open Saturdays and Sundays. But you can peek over the fence and see a lot of the different vehicles and Military things that they have on display. It looks like there's a lot.,Bernardo F
50,Route 66 Sort of Fun!,"If you enjoy seeing armored vehicles and other military equipment up close, this is a great attraction. This is ""Route 66-Goofy-Kitschy-Sort of Fun""!I took my younger son here on a Saturday as he's big into military museums and equipment. It's a bit of a drive from Costa Mesa but we had a good time. The museum is more like a large dirt lot with lots and lots of military equipment - both restored and awaiting restoration - are stored. The visitors parking lot will hold about 15 cars but it was never busy while we were there. The place is a not-for-profit operation and depends entirely on the entrance fees and donations to restore and maintain their vehicles. As of November, 2015, the entry fee for adults was $5 and $1 for children. Check their website for updated information.The gentleman at the front desk was really nice and friendly and gave us a binder with the indexed information on each vehicle (to be returned when we were done). You can get pretty close but not climb on, all the tanks and stuff that they have tucked away there. It's pretty impressive. Most of the equipment is from World War 2 and the early Cold War periods up to about 1975 or so. You won't find any Abrams, for example, although you will find a beautifully restored M551 Sheridan light tank and three great examples of the M4 Sherman (three different variants).They have a small ""gift shop"" under the EZ-Up tent with the requisite models, tanks, RC vehicles, etc.Some recommendations: Walking through this museum will take about an hour and the only facilities are a porta-potty. While it is very interesting and I'm glad we went, it doesn't really rate being the primary reason to visit the area. Add this to your itinerary. You will enjoy it but, again, be realistic as it is small and more like a restoration shop that is open to the public. Set your expectations accordingly. Additionally, the facility is not open when it is raining as it's on a dirt lot and there are no canopies.Directions: The museum is on the east side of Rosemead Blvd. If you're coming north on Rosemead from the 60 Freeway, stay in the right hand lane as the museum will quickly sneak up on you and you will miss it if you're not watching for it.",Paul S
40,Great if you are into this sore of things.,"Tanks, tanks everywhere. Not a grand museum big a lottle gem hidden in the middle of an warehouse area. An hour is enough for this place.",jeffd2000s
30,One Mans Labour of Love,"Tanks, Tanks and more Tanks.... Throw in a heaping helping of all things large & military and a couple acres of land and you get the American Military Museum.I found this place after it was featured on a Canadian TV show. It's all out doors. About 10 seconds after meeting the owner, you can tell this is his labor of love. He's got lots to be proud of.This is a small road side attraction in a small town north east of Los Angeles. It's dusty, it's a dirt path lot, some of the tanks and other vehicles are dirty and yes rusty.... Perfect I say!! Don't expect the smithsonian and you'll be just fine!You have to be a military buff to get the most out of it, but even my wife had a look. Apparently about half still run .There's a Huey helicopter, several artillery pieces, ambulances, jeeps, half tracks, apc's... And yes tanks. There is also a decommissioned LAPD Apc with a ram on the front. Some of the items are pretty beat up, others are restored quite nicely. It's cheap to tour $5/adults, $3/ teens and $1 kids. You can breeze thru in about 45 min, but if you went thru all 100 or so displays in the self guided walking tour binder it would take close to 2 hours.Don't forget to check out the Russian T72 in the back, most impressive!!Thanks for reading and if you found this useful please click helpful below. Godspeed!",Saskheat
50,Awesome museum,"I love tanks and this museum was a great place to visit. They had many tanks but also had many vehicles and gun, one which they had was one out of two in the whole world. Each piece had a stone in front of it with a number and that number corresponded with a number in a book that told you about the piece. That was very nice. It is all out side so it can get really hot but you are in California what do you expect. I would go back any chance I had and would recommend it to anyone who loved military vehicles.",legobrickter99
