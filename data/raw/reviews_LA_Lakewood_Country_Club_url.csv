40,18 holes,"Very nice golf course. Played 18 holes, course is good for the average golfer. Will play there again next time I'm in Lakewood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wredmann1
20,Hope you have 6 hours to kill!,"Played last Saturday, had a 2:00 pm tee time. Didn't actually tee off until 2:25 due to over-crowding and lack of golf carts. This is the third and final round I will play here - every time is a marathon session and always a delay on actual tee times.It's a shame because the course is fun to play when you don't have to wait on every hole. It seems likely that they are over-booking the course and then they let the players deal with it on their own. No marshal to be found on Saturday, no beverage cart either.When we got to the 12th hole there were 4, yes 4 groups waiting to tee off. It was now 6:00 pm and we decided it wasn't worth the wait. We would have finished the round around 8:00 pm on a 2:00 pm scheduled tee time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandenike
30,Jan 1st Round,"Most Regional course can get pretty packed on any given day, but on this Tuesday Jan 1st it played around a 5 hour round. Normally most Friday / Saturday / Sunday can play closer to a 6 hour round if you start later then 9AM.Greens were in decent shape, but still very bumpy from when they punched about a month ago. Also, it is a public course so a lot of the sand traps were not racked.All in All Lakewood is ok, but the fairways could use some help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverRaine
30,Busy executive course,"This is an executive course which is very busy. Too many leagues hinder a round of golf for the public. 3 of us teed off before a league late morning, then when we hit the 10th tee there were at least 20 people waiting to tee off for an afternoon league. We ended up playing front nine again until it became too much of a waiting game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sue0501
10,Corporate outing,"Don't botherPlayed the course on a beautiful California day. Course looked nice but is maintained like a muni. Greens were decent stimping at 8-9. Fairways and surrounding areas Were either weedy or bare ground. The food buffet after was horrible.!the burgers came out under cooked and cold, bad combination. There are much better choices in the area. It's too bad, nice layout and challenging par threes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfguyhngc
40,Really nice public course,This is my regular golf course. It will be upgraded substantially in the next few months so play may be less than ideal during this time but then it should go back to its normally excellent level. The course is quite pretty and in decent condition given the drought. It offers a good challenge for golfers of all levels and the management is working hard to make this a great place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UltimateWines
30,A Day To Remember,"Lakewood Country Club is the combined collaboration of William Bell (architect ) and Casey O'Callaghan  (course designer ). It is rich in heritage and history. Its first golf pro was Jimmy Thomson, a Long Drive Champion. When the course opened in 1933, Bobby Jones hit the opening drive and his ball was signed and displayed in the trophy case. Lakewood is also the home course for LPGA player Brianna Do. Lakewood has hosted several tournaments such as the prestigious Long Beach Open Championship, and the Southern California Public Links Championship.     Lakewood Country Club has a beautiful layout which includes several large ponds, mature trees, sloping greens and an abundance of deep sand traps that rival those found in Ireland and Scotland. The greens are moderately fast. The course features Bermuda grass on the tees and fairways, while the greens are made with Poa grass. The course is relatively flat and easy to walk. The par 3's are the courses signature holes. All are long except for one, with intimidating features which adds some drama to club selection or skill set. The Clubhouse is a charming Spanish ranch style design, that has a well stocked pro shop, and elegant banquet facilities.     The day I played Lakewood it was sunny, with a mild breeze and the temperature was in the mid 60's.  I played the white tees which has a slope rating of 70/120 and measures 6416 yards.  There are 5 sets of tee boxes and the Championship tees are 7033 yards with a slope rating of 73/128.      This remarkable facility seems to have all the elements to provide a wonderful golfing experience, yet this day failed on several accounts. First, the tee times were delayed a half hour due to over booking. There were two groups of fivesomes in front of me playing from the wrong tee box (dreamers or delusionists?) which led to slow play and a 5 1/2 hour round. Our group waited on every hole to tee off or hit approach shots to the green. Next, the greens were in very bad condition, likely due to budget cuts at Long Beach Parks and Recreation and drought conditions in CA.  There were too many bare spots of varying sizes, and divot holes. Finally, the rangers and starter either did not understand their job responsibilities, or were lazy about minding the pace of play.     There are a few other public golf courses near Lakewood that are better managed and the course condition is in better shape. As a visitor to California and the Long Beach area, I would only consider  golfing at Lakewood Golf Course under present conditions if green fees are reduced to low to mid 30 range or the greens are greatly improved.Course ReviewH Bell (Golf Enthusiast)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hbell2015
