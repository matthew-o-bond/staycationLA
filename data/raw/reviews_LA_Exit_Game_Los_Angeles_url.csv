20,"Sorcery room, disapointing","This was my least favorite escape room out of all the ones I've ever done. Do not reserve the sorcery room!. A lot of time is spent listening to recordings and video which is wasted time from your 60 minutes. Only a couple of people can solve a puzzle at a time, so everyone else stands around looking because there is nothing else to do. May beest for a group of 2, not a larger group. The last puzzle is not explained very well so you have to guess what to do. I hear some of the other rooms here are great, guess we just got the bad one. Custumer service was very good. So go but dont waste your time in the sorcery room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy0100
50,Exit Game,First time going. Won't be the last time for me. The rooms were pretty creative. They also have boba next door if you are hungry or thirsty and you can bring them over. They also have board games to play with while you are waiting for your turn. They even have a slide so that means one of their rooms is a dual floors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atjig
50,Magic Made,Had a fantastic time discovering the magic of the Harry Potter escape room here! Tons of fun and really well done!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahdG7819WY
50,"One of, if not the best, Companies in LA","My girlfriend and I have done 50+ rooms and the customer service here is probably the best we've ever had. A great escape room begins and ends with the game-masters and the two we've had here were both friendly, accommodating, funny and went above and beyond to be sure we had an excellent experience.The 3 rooms we tackled were among the best we've done and we really enjoyed them all. My favorite would have to be Villains Lair followed by An Hour to Kill and finally A.I.Great themes & story, fun tech, exciting reveals, fun physical activities and a few awesome AhHa Moments.I live out-of-state but the experience was so good that I intend to return just so I can try the new games they will be opening soon in Orange County!Fantastic experience all around. My only regret is not getting the GM's names so I could thank them by name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylerr604
50,One of my favorite escape games,I did a room at Exit Game as my first game three years ago and just did numbers 36 and 37 tonight and it remains some of my favorite rooms.The tech in their rooms is cutting edge and they always have a few surprises. The themeing and set design is amazing and the staff are absolutely incredible; friendly and genuinely seem like they want you to have fun.What a blast. They have some of the most innovative ideas I think I’ve ever seen. (Check out the slide). I can’t wait until I get time to do the other two rooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregbM5828XN
40,"Friendly Staff, Great Escape Room, would be 5 Stars but ...","I had my daughters 13th birthday here. She had been to a party here before and had fun so this is what she chose for her birthday. I have no personal experience with the escape room itself (they did the An Hour To Kill room), but my daughter & her friends had a great time, even though they didn't escape. The staff was VERY nice and friendly. I was shocked to read so many negative reviews about customer service regarding the staff because everyone we dealt with was super friendly. My daughter's game was free because it was her birthday and she signed up ahead of time.The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is for 2 reasons:1. The place is not easy to find. The shopping center itself was easy enough to find but once there, we had no idea where to go and could not find The Exit Game on any of the directories. We had parents dropping kids off for the party and it was difficult for them to find. They need more signage letting people know where to go once they are parked. Thankfully, I told everyone to be there earlier than our time so no one was late.2. We had to pay $50 for a table to have after for the birthday guests to have pizza & cake (that you bring yourself). It wasn't in a private room - just one of the tables they already have out for their customers. I truly feel $50 is WAY TOO much to charge. It's pretty outrageous and I would not recommend paying it.My daughter had a great birthday and lots of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTreppFamily
10,Disappointed,"We booked for 7 players and paid an additional $40 to make it private, which was up to 10 players. So, we assumed we could have up to 10. We had 9 and they charged us for the extra 2 when we arrived, but didn’t take off the $40 private booking and it wasn’t like they were going to add another single player to our group. Website is not very clear. Too much going on when we arrived. Once inside the room, they did not explain very well what our mission was or where to start. We all were not clear on what to do first. Clues given were not a great help. It’s an hour you have to escape and the clock started exactly at your scheduled time, so we were a 1:20 start and although we didn’t get into the room until 1:27, we already lost 7 minutes. Won’t go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kidcass
50,So fun! Great staff!,We had a lot of fun at Exit Game. There were five of us who played the AI storyline. I really liked that they had multiple rooms as part if the puzzles and you end up using all the rooms throughout your event. We won which is good but did not beat hard mode.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chickabeegrrl
10,HORRIBLE STAFF,"My daughter arranged a room for her and her friends for her birthday. The staff is unprofessional, disrespectful, dishonest and downright rude. Erin, the manager, interrupted me mid-sentence when I called to discuss my concerns. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.My daughter's phone stopped working while she was driving there and she got lost. She went to Starbucks to use her laptop and got the phone number for Exit Game and directions. She could not call her friends because her phone was not working so she called to ask the staff to talk to her friends to let her friends know what was going on.She asked to speak to them and was told no. She asked if they could wait and was told no. She asked if she could speak to them and was told no and she could not join them if she was late.She did not go, but her friends did. Some of the props malfunctioned and their experience was ruined. The staff was disrespectful and sarcastic. Said ""duh"" to her friend. I called to find out about potentially rescheduling and told that the cancellation fee was $50; however the booking fee was only $32. It is better to walk in than to make an appointment.Long story short, the staff AND the manager are unprofessional, rude and disrespectful. I hope the owner replaces and/or retrains them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6458WMmarcias
50,Great Escape Room,"There was just me and a friend visiting Los Angeles from England for a week, we're massive fans of escape room so I googled one's near us and this one had good reviews.It was easy to find with sat nav and we parked in the multi-storey car park next to it. We hadn't booked as didn't know which one to do. When we entered a really nice girl helped us, she never told us her name and I forgot to ask which is a shame as I always like to reward good service but she was the only girl working Sunday 5th February '17 around 11am.We are fans of Harry Potter so she encouraged us to do 'The School of Sorcery'. This was amazing, we loved every minute of it..apart from the bad english accent of one of the actresses but even that we laughed at.We loved 'The School of Sorcery' so much that we booked straight onto the next one 'The A.I.', this was good but we need a lot of help, probably because we were quite tired but it was still great and we escaped.The only one comment I would make is that when you need a hint they actually come into the room which for me spoils the moment a little but as soon as they're gone you get back into it, in all other escape rooms we've done they usually give the hints over a speaker or on a computer so it doesn't interfere with the moment.I would highly recommend this exit game for everyone. There was only two of us and we loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNT8114
50,Super Fun Escape Experience!,"I love themed escape rooms, but usually choose ones with a little lighter theme! We went ahead and decided on 'The Villains Lair' because it had the highest rate of difficulty (23%) at the Exit Game. It was challenging, but super fun at the same time! The Villains Lair was imaginative and unique. It tested our calmness under pressure, decision making and our ability to work together as a team! We escaped with seconds to spare. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our three-generation family member team enjoyed our Exit Game Los Angeles experience and if visiting Southern California in the future we will definitely return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
50,Great Teamwork!,"Took my family to Exit Game and it was only us. We did lab #2 and enjoyed it. Everyone contributed something helpful for the clues. Since this was our first foray into this type of challenge, we don't have any comparison points. Totally worth the time and great way to see that your children are engaged and thinking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/punkguins
50,Great Experience,"Fantastic experience, missions are very well done with technology and originality. I would recommend groups as the missions are very involved and exciting!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazcadet
40,A Great Place to Hang Out with Friends,"At first, I was anxious about being put into a room and trying to get out on my own but once, we got into the room, I was really excited. There are some things that I would recommend. One thing would be to use the restroom before you enter the room. Another thing is to bring a whole group of friends with you. The more people you have in the room, the more likely you can figure it out. I would also say that it would be a good place to hang out with people that you do not know as well. The staff is really nice and the rooms are great (I've done one but if the other rooms measure up to the one I did, then the rest should be great as well.) Exit Game hyped me up for other games that are like the escape rooms and I can't wait to go back to try other rooms. I'll be back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToriY
50,Review from escape room owner,"We did the AI room, it was amazing! I've done escape rooms around the world, this one has the best use if technology i've seen. The staff is really nice as well. If you like escape rooms You can't miss this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GonzaloA388
50,Awesome experience,"Awesome experience, the missions are very original and cleverly designed. Missions are very realistic!! Great idea for parties and couples!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazcadet
50,Awesome- but bring more than two,I've only been to one other slightly obscure escape room game in Singapore so I don't have much to compare it to but from what I can tell this place is fantastic. We were very impressed by the technology and how we interacted with it to solve puzzles (we tried the AI room). We also liked the backstory and how the AI computer 'Ada' talks to you during the puzzle. We do highly recommend going in a group larger than two...me and my hubby went and didn't have quite enough time (understandable considering the rooms are designed for groups of 6-8). Anyway long story short it was very enjoyable and we plan to come again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonnetm2015
50,Best place to be at with your friends!,I was invited here to go through one of the mazes. I wasn't sure how I would do but I learned that this place is for everyone! I had a blast here and I'm sure you will too. It won't hurt your wallet either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophernoda69
40,Very Impressive Experience of Room Escaping,"We endeavored to escape from the room ""artificial intelligence"" today and we were really impressed by the delicate technologies and fascinating room layouts. Successfully escaping from room requires capabilities of comprehensive analysis and collaborative work between teammates, as well as innovative perspectives of reasoning and analyzing. The plot was very well designed and the clues were coherently presented and highly mutually associated.The facility features five different escaping rooms with increasing degrees of difficulty. The escaping time is strictly controlled and the staff is very friendly to help you out when needed. The only defect of the game in the ""artificial intelligence"" room was that some sensor had not been working sensitively, so players might need to redo certain maneuvers to let the computerized sensors confirm those correct motions that players have carried out, which may cost more of the escaping time significantly.Overall, this has been an awesome experience. We would like to try other rooms with different themes next time. We are strongly recommending the escape game to more people who may be interested in collaborative working and solving logical problems/puzzles under pressure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harrisonl813
10,Something was broken in the room before we went in and caused us to fail,"It was pretty interesting in the beginning and then towards the end we couldn't solve a puzzle which made us ran out of time and failed. We then asked the staff what was the solution to that puzzle, the staff responded that something was broken in the room and that we would never have found the answer. I was like are you serious? Why didn't you tell us before letting us in??? We literally spent half of our time trying to figure out the answer to that puzzle and now you are telling me it was impossible?Obviously we were not happy and said this is not fair. The staff just said ""I'm really sorry."" and did nothing.So remember to ask the staff if everything is working before going in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotcocoz
50,Escape room,Great fun! Super high quality rooms and great staff!! I've played almost all of their rooms and each one is just as good as the last. I would suggest Exit Game escape rooms for anyone looking for a fun night out!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221jacobf

50,"Fun, challenging, and great for all ages!","I had a great time completing one of the missions! It was a fun challenge and was a great way to spend an evening with friends. This was my first time doing one of these challenges, and I was very impressed/mind blown. Clearly, so much thought goes into developing these mazes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emersonadventures
50,A must do!,We have completed 2 of the rooms here so far and can't wait to come back for more! Both rooms were intricately detailed and were amazingly well thought out. The engineering in these rooms is so impressive you won't find another escape room like these. That's why this one has been on the top of our list for favorite escape rooms that we have done so far!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheEscapologists
50,Best escape room!!,"I did mission two and it was AMAZING! The puzzles were great, the room blew my mind, and the staff was super friendly.I would recommend this room to everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178bril
50,Awesome fun,Incredibly well done. Especially awesome for people that love escape rooms!!! Beautifully themed and great puzzles. I was totally puzzled a few times. We did room 3 & 2 on the same day and would've done the 1 but it was late and we were tired. :-) Highly recommend!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
50,Room escape game near LA,"Love room escape games, and I loved this place! They offered 3 different rooms to choose from, which is good for variety. Their room setup and equipment is pretty nice and clean/professional, and the owners are super friendly! I've tried and failed Mission 1 (the Vault) and passed Mission 2 (Lab 51). I liked the puzzle difficulty - but definitely bring more people for more eyes and more brains! At the end, they do NOT tell you what you missed/how to solve the room if you failed, so it's a little bit frustrating because they don't have a cheaper option for return/veteran groups to retry the room(s) they failed. The owner did say that some groups would fail and pay an extra ticket price to gain another hour and continue to finish the room but I would like maybe a half price half hour etc option. Definitely going to go back for Mission 3! I was also told they're in the process of developing more rooms! Woohoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnt242
50,Fun team work,"We all had a blast solving the puzzles in The Lab. None of the puzzles were frustratingly difficult, nor were they too easy. Definitely will go back to try the other rooms!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baoh319
50,Great Escape Game venue in LA,Great Experience! They were able to connect few rooms together as one big one. Very creative and great production - probably with great engineers to get up the puzzles to solve.Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VK322
50,Great experience,"I've never been to a place like this before, but it was great. Makes you think, it's a unique experience everyone must try it especially if you like puzzles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derykaguilar
50,Great Experience,"It was my first time ever trying a place like this. It was a lot of fun and really gets you to think. Although we didn't finish it, I would love to go again! We tried Area 51 and would definitely do it again to finish it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suziei2015
50,Great Experience! Lots of fun!,"I came with about 5 of my friends, 6 people total. It was first time experiencing anything like this before. We ended up doing Area 51 and almost passed it, but sadly didn't. The staff was really nice and helpful and even took our picture at the wall of shame lol. The building is big with lots of room for sitting down and relaxing as they prep the rooms to be explored. The puzzles are really creative and quite challenging, make sure to think outside the box! As for the price, its a little pricey, but totally worth it if you've never experienced an interactive escape room before. I really enjoyed it an highly recommend it.- Jonathan Gutierrez",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jon_stp
50,The best escape game in town!,"This is the best escape game in town. Superlative. The games are elegant and have high quality, astonishing production values and aha moments. I can't recommend this game enough.We did two games: the lab and the vault. We escaped the lab but not the vault. Regardless, both experiences stayed with us for a long time after.Just genius.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Real_ACR_Owner
50,Fantastic experience,"Very fun experience. I have tried several ""escape game"" type games before and this place is a favorite. Lots of great puzzles and clever mechanisms. Puzzles are pretty hard- so be prepared for a challenge. Area 51 was my favorite of all the options- but they all were fun and had interesting puzzles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureGuy5
40,It's in Monterey Park.,"Had no clue this place existed. I found it on this site and I signed up right away . I parked in the depths of the shopping center underground. This place is located on first floor behind escalator.Very fun. Very challenging! I went with my honey and it was not easy, the more eyes in the game the better. You have to solve puzzles and look for clues.Just remember on the vault scenario..... ENTRAPMENT Laser scene!We had a good time only downside was it was kind of expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiefYuka1
50,Something new to do!,"This place is absolutely amazing! Wasn't sure what this place was at first, but the concept was pretty simple to grasp once we started. You and your group are given one hour to solve puzzles to proceed throughout the rooms. The puzzles aren't overtly difficult, but boy do they make you feel stupid after you solve it. It's a great place for a lazy friday night if you're wondering what to do and where to go with your friends. I'm definitely coming back to try out the other rooms, or maybe just bring in a different group of friends so I can laugh at them as they struggle through!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronl940
50,Really fun place - Very unique,AMAZING!!!!! One of most fun things you can do in Los Angeles. It was our first time going to this place and playing this kind of game. We had so much fun. Can't wait to go back to play again. I recommend everyone try these games.Pay attention to small details but don't be too overly analytical. The puzzles are easier to solve in a large group. When I went with my friend there was no one else with us and it was difficult. They give you a walkie-talkie and allow one clue per room.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonTST
50,"Very fun ""room escape"" adventure.","Love this place! Great for hang out with friends.Good quality puzzles, ideal for group of people. They currently have three challenge adventures available. The atmosphere and ambiance are very cool, depending on the room.Having tried many of this type of game before, I can definitely say the puzzles, presentation, and professionalism are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DreamyJM
50,One of the best hidden gems of Los Angeles,"This is the most fun Ive had in Los Angeles! Everyone needs to go now, the puzzles are super fun and really take you to another world. I cant believe how much better this is than the other escape games I have played. They use so much special effects that I just want to see all the rooms. Our group did not pass the vault but we are definately coming back to finish. One hint: Keep your eyes open and notice all the clues they give you!!! THE MOST FUN U CAN HAVE IN LOS ANGELES!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonardLeo
50,"FUN for all ages, best exit game activity in Los Angeles!","I went to Exit Game's soft opening this past weekend and HAD A BLAST. It was my first time playing an ""escape"" game, where the premise is you get locked into a room and try to get out before time's up. You solve puzzles by finding and decoding hints that involve reasoning and observation!Despite some really smart, puzzle-solving experts on my team of 11 people (including a game designer, PhD, and several engineers), we still failed to escape in time. They allow you one hint for the entire hour, and we blew it on the first room (The Vault, rated at 2 out of 5 difficulty) after failing to solve anything for the first 15 minutes. :(I won't spoil any of the puzzles for you, and don't let anyone else do it either! This place is supposed to be different due to the more physically-interactive puzzles, where you open locks and find doors and things, rather than solve puzzles on paper. The rooms were challenging and well-designed, and part of my group's inability to solve puzzles was probably due to us being too excited to focus on doing things the logical way! My group could not stop talking about our experience playing the game and went back a month later to try a new room!DEFINITELY coming back once more rooms are open! A MUST DO in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401rhino
