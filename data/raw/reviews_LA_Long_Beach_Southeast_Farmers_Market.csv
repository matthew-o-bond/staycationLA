40,Looking for fresh California produce? Come here!,"Wonderful place to seek out the very freshest, locally grown produce. It's amazing how many locals are unaware of it. Discovered it about three months ago and now weekly drop in to purchase all manner of fresh fruits, and vegetables. The site also boasts some handicraft vendors who offer jewelry, ceramics/pottery, clothing, scents, soaps, etc. There are some excellent prepared food vendors as well so you can eat your lunch and enjoy the music played live by little combos throughout the venue. Vendors are generous with samples, so you can ""graze"" your way from one booth to the next. It's fun!",Dagnytags
