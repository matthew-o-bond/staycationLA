50,Cheese-making with Kyrsten was SO FUN!,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time during ""The Cheese Whiz"" class, led by Kyrsten. Things to note:1. The space is within a very industrial area. The location of Hipcooks is deep within. I simply followed the directions that was emailed to me and was able to easily park and find the class. Here were the instructions: Our address is 642 Moulton Ave, Unit E21. However, we are physically inside the complex. To find us: once you turn on Moulton, make your 2nd possible left at ""The Brewery"" sign. Continue until the stop sign (Barbara's Restaurant is straight ahead). Hipcooks is to the right of the stop sign, along the alleyway. Park in the lot on your left & walk on up to Hipcooks!2. Parking is free!3. Hipcooks sells various items handy for the kitchen from microzesters to knives to vanilla bean paste to cute aprons. They take cash and card for whatever you would like to purchase4. We cleaned our hand very regularly - if you ever touched your phone or your face, there was a nearby sink for the purpose of cleaning your hands before handling the food! I really appreciated this since we were communally cooking (and eating).5. There was an 'assistant' in the class who helped clean materials as we went - that made for transitioning between dishes really easy.6. There was water and chilled mint tea available to hydrate!7. Restrooms were upstairs.8. Once you arrived, there was a clipboard to sign in at the door and cubby spaces to hold your belongings. There were hairties available too if you forgot one. Aprons were also available.9. Once you opened the door you are immediately greeted by a large dining table that is already set - in anticipation of feasting off all the food prepared during the class! So fun!10. All recipes and instructions were emailed the day after so you can start practicing and impressing at home right away!Our instructor led a brief orientation at the start of our class explaining how the philosophy of Hipcooks is to really go at your pace and adding your own flair. Normally we would loosely follow recipes and adding the amount of salt or spice you personally desire. However, since I attended the cheese-making class, she added that this would be a little different since cheese-making required a little bit of science and therefore specific measurements. However, with the food prepared with the cheese we were able to exercise a little more freedom.Now specifically for the cheese-making class...We learned how to make Mascarpone, Chevre Goat cheese, Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Fromage Fort. We worked our way up on the difficulty scale of the cheeses. Surprisingly Mozarella was most challenging! But right after making all these cheeses, we were able to jump into the eating portion because Kyrsten had all prepped all the additional ingredients that simply needed the addition of our cheeses! This was a great reward after a long class - 4 hours in total! I wasn't even hungry or realized how late into the afternoon it was when the food came out though because we were having so much fun.With the cheeses we made 1. two types of goat cheese: one rolled in crushed pistachios and honey and the other rolled in dried oregano - both delicious! Going with toasted baguettes. 2. roasted tomatoes with ricotta - yum! 3. Pizza Bianca using prepared pizza dough from Trader Joe's and topped with our fresh mozzarella oven baked to gooey deliciousness! 4. Fromage Fort dip with celery and carrot. 5. Sweet Mascarpone mixed with some vanilla bean paste (SO GOOD!) and orange zest piped into rehyrated apricots and topped with a sprinkling of crushed pistachios ... delicious.I had so much fun with the class - very engaging. I was so excited to receive the recipes and started right away - the next day!! Kyrsten made herself very available to answering any questions as well. I have emailed her several times to troubleshoot some areas I had run into trouble at home but also to share triumphs of cheese-making at home! Would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone - super fun for individuals, couples, friends and more! Most of my classmates had come on their own but we all had fun together. Also at the end of the class there were cheese kits Kyrsten had prepared with the additional ingredients needed for cheese-making (all the different kinds at least once) - I was able to pay with credit card.Sidenote: there was a special assistant's program available where if you assist 3 classes, you can attend 1 for free! The assistant observes most of the time, helps clean utensils and other equipment in between dishes but still got to enjoy all the fruit of our labor! I would totally do this if I can fit it into my schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imskimmy

50,"Fun, educational, and yummy!!","Hip Cooks is located in the artist loft area called ""The Brewery"". It is in a wonderful building surrounded by a culture of creativity.I took a class on Tapas that provided me with many ideas for dishes I want to try. This is not my first experience with a cooking class but it is my first experience with being creative and recipe-free (don't be scared, they send you suggested recipes after the class). This is hands-on, everyone participates and has the opportunity to provide input as to ingredients and quantities -- with a little coaching by the instructor. Then everything gobbled up by all classmates round a community table. The Tapas class included glasses of Sangria that we concocted.I must say something about the instructor. Her attitude including enthusiasm and humor made the class this incredible and fun-filled experience.There is free parking at the Brewery but you may need to look a distance from the building because they seemed to fill up close to Hip Cooks. Be sure to check out all of the nifty kitchen gadgets in their small collection of items for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
50,LOVED our time making Tapas with Tory,"This was our first time at a cooking class with Hipcooks. Tory was the instructor and taught us Tapas. It was fun, delicious, and we learned a lot! We will definitely be back to take some other classes!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twelve1212
50,A GREAT pairing of a fun cooking class and HEALTHY food!,"How does spring rolls, pad Thai, chicken satay, sticky rice, red/green curry (and more dishes!), and even beer, sound? These Thai dishes (and more!) were taught to our small, 10 student class by a warm, talented, cooking instructor named Courtney! She taught us awesome cooking techniques and gave us great recipes as well. Courtney shared with the class her recent cooking experiences in Thailand. She incorporated what she learned in Thailand with her what she was teaching in the classroom! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, made new friends, and left with a healthy feeling in our stomach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4everBuds
