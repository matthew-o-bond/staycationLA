40,Doll house delight,If you blink you would miss it. The angel statue outside the Victorian house structure if it's hard to find. It's metro close and offers a fine selection of doll house displays to view. I found a few unique items in the gift shop that were not expensive.,SMOgal
50,Doll Museum in Santa Monica,"My husband and I visited this museum on Oct. 4th, 2016, and even though it was notopen that day, Charles opened it because it was the only day I would be in Santa Monica and when I called him from FL and told him I was desperate to see it, because I have loved miniature furniture and dollhouses, and dolls all of my life, he said he would open it. How kind was that of him, that was his personal time. All I can say isas I told him, he was my ""angel"", I loved seeing that museum and its' contents, I do not even have enough good words to describe it, awesome, beautiful, amazing, anabsolute visual joy. And Charles is so informative, interesting and charismatic, all I can say to him, is thank you, thank you, thank you for such a memory that brought me so much happiness",Priescilla
50,A HIDDEN SECRET,"Angel's Attic, is just wonderful. It really is a hidden treasure and not something you'd expect to see in a busy place like Santa Monica.There are heaps and heaps of Dolls Houses to view and also dolls and other miniatures.The Historic house they are in is also beautiful but surrounded by modern buildings, the new tram tracks are right outside, it is about 5 minutes walk from the beach (Ocean Ave) on Colorado Blvd just passed Sears.When we visited the door was locked but we rang the door bell and were let in by a lovely gentleman - sorry I can't remember his name. We were shown around and told all about the historic dolls houses and also a little about the history of the home and owner.Even my male partner found it interesting, we spent about an hour there, I could have stayed all day or even forever! I was in heaven!I hope the Santa Monica Tourist Board knows what a wonderful place Angel's Attic is, it's a quiet attraction that should be forever saved.",Rachel1087
40,Doll House Victorian in Santa Monica ...,"A quaint & charming well preserved Victorian house which holds a treasure trove of Doll Houses & accouterments. Ladies & girls will be nostalgically swept off their feet. Guys like it because the miniature constructions keep them busy. A special treat place, plus the house reminds you that this is how Ocean Ave. homes looked - before the modern gentrification. Enjoy..",David B L
50,Charming and impressive,"My wife Sandra and I visited the museum in September 2010 during our annual vacation from the UK. The place is magical and inspiring, and the gentleman who gave us the tour was so helpful, knowledgeable and positive. He gave us as much time as we needed to look around and ask questions, providing fascinating information about each doll house and its history and context. We will seek out the Bethnal Green doll museum on his recommendation.There was so much to see, and everything was so beautiful - the building itself, all the doll houses and of course their little inhabitants! Sandra loved the museum and the Beatrix potter characters in particular, we will definitely return. Highly recommended.",RichS67
40,Dollhouses and Dolls,I visited this Victorian house in Santa Monica. There was a vast array of beautiful and old doll houses and dolls throughout the house. The person at the museum was friendly and informative. I have never seen anything like this but it was a nice pleasant surprise to discover something a little bit different in Santa Monica to see. A must if you are a dollhouse fan.,bilby2009
50,Amazing Collection of Doll Houses,"We found this small museum through Trip Advisor and sure were glad that we did, The beautiful, historic Victorian House is jam packed with doll houses, doll furniture, dolls and a few toys. All are incredibly well displayed thanks to the amazing talent of the museum artistic director and host Charles Phillips. He proudly shows off the collection and provides much information on the items that you are seeing. The children and adults that were there when we visited were all almost overwhelmed with delight and awe. The house contains millions of dollars worth of items, all collected by a woman who entrusted then to Charles to create the museum. It is hard to imagine a nicer, more complete collection, so well displayed in two floors of the rather small house. Aso take in the back garden where they host tea parties. I guarantee that it will be a memorable visit.",oompahdave
50,"A great little, forgotten place.","I agree with another reviewer, this is a hidden gem. I'm always so happy to see it's still open. I used to go a lot when I was little and now I'm looking forward to taking my niece there. Places like this are rare.",Emily K
50,A Hidden Gem,"Angel's Attic in Santa Monica is a hidden gem in the LA area. In my recent visits, I have been alone or with one other group. The museum is in a Victorian house that is worth the visit. The antique doll houses are filled with original furniture and dolls. There are also some exquisite modern houses and other antique toys. Girls of all ages will love it, but even boys can be enchanted!",MargieLA
