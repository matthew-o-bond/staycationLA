50,Local Theatre,"Decided last minute to go see a performance. Didn't take printed tickets but theatre manager honored our e tickets from my smart phone. He was so friendly and helpful. Great venue, any seat is a good seat. Beverages and snacks are available on site. Really enjoyed the intimate and casual setting. Good to know such a great little venue is nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eva9630
