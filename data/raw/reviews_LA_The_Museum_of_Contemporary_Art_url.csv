40,Multiple Highlights,The best part of our visit was seeing how many teen aged students came in groups to benefit from the museum’s exhibits and learning opportunities. We also noted how many young people worked for MOCA as guards. The exhibits’ variation added to the quality of our experience. Robert Frank’s much touted series of photographs of “The Americans.” Pattern and Decoration in American Art with fabulous quilts and more. The museum shop was one of the most creative that I have seen. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/204roberti
40,"Great Exhibits , and very nice welcome ...","Great place to visit in LA. Not far from Grand Market, and the Walt Disney Hall. It is free, you can leave with bags well secure at the front desk . The place it’s very interesting, and colourful. Great exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
50,Go to MOCA,This was a wonderful afternoon. MOCA is now free admission. They have a great new layout of the museum. Some very interesting new exhibits. I just love seeing what is on display. There is a wonderful interactive art installation that has you walk through rooms of different colors. The museum staff is very knowledgeable. This was a great way to spend some time looking at world-class art in Downtown LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst
20,Not much to see!,"Not much to see! I was in and out within half hour. But I'm not a big modern art fan, except for abstract art, which I love. I don't get stacking cereal boxes in a couple directions and then calling that art. And then getting it in a museum!!This museum was free, which is good, as I wouldn't have wanted to pay for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Backpacker_0905
30,Okay,Great art pieces and its free to visit. I really like the LED room. Very interesting pieces but I also thought it was kind of simple.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dayzers_
50,Fascinating views of the modern,"One of the first of many great works we saw was Max Ernst's Capricorn, a striking creation. A sculpture by Louise Nevelson titled Sky Cathedral / Southern Mountain was impressive. In black, a colour that engaged the artist, it comprises a plethora of stacked boxes each filled wood fragments,Two Tall Figures were unmistakably Giacometti. Now 90 years, the Stockholm born Claes Oldenburg's array of objects, including a Burger and a Shirt and more on a Chair is a good exponent of Pop-Art.Mark Rothko has a few works on display, including Reds and Violet and Rust and Blue. Night Sherbet is an imaginative pour-piece by Lynda Benglis.A deconstructed piano by Raphael Ortiz is one of a series since the mid-1960s where the artist chopped at musical instruments, symbolising the liberation of the material to its original form.A sweet work is Chocolates by Felix Gonzales-Torres, comprising one of his mounds of foil wrapped chocolates to which visitors are invited to partake. We assisted with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
30,Hit and miss,We went there on Thursday evening when it was free to visit. It was well worth it then but I'm not sure if it's worth paying the admission though. I personally enjoyed The Broad more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Pattern and Decoration Show,"Excellent show, well displayed with good descriptions. Some of the best examples of Pattern and Decoration movement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer
40,Very Good Exhibits and Helpful Staff,"I went to LA to visit a bunch of museums. This was my first stop. A very nice museum with an average amount of exhibits. There are many good ones in here.I was worried about parking. I had heard horror stories. But if you go to the parking that is just north of the museum it is cheap and close. I also left the car parked and walked to the other museums like the Japanese American Museum, the Broad, the Moca Grand and the LA Chamber of Commerce observation deck. It is a bit of a walk but you don't have worry about parking over and over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
20,Not surprised by negative reviews,"In a tourist book we had read much acclaimed hype about this location. We visited on a Sunday and was there at opening time of 1000. The cost for us two is us to enter the MOCA was $20and at the sales desk we were informed that only half the exhibition was open. When we asked why we were being charged full price for only half the exhibits we were told that we could, with our admission tickets visit another MOCA outlet about a mile away! Having entered the museum we were advised that we could not take Backpacks in and we had to take all our valuable out of our bag and put them into a carrier bag given to us for that purpose. I am not sure what either of us were expecting and I am sure that someone who understands contemporary art could explain, but some of the exhibits make you think ‘really!! Did we enjoy it no. Have we ween better, absolutely and because there was only have the exhibition open we were soon back outside. We did not bother to walk to the other location just to be disappointed again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reacher33
30,Not The Broad and Over Priced!,"La MOCA is pretty small and just can't compete with The Broad. There are some quality works here, but, the collection and galleries as a whole are small in size and quality. Adding insult to injury is you have to pay to visit here and The Broad is free. Very hard to compete with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hermuslj
10,waist of time and money,The Museum of Contemporary Art is very small there are much better options for things to do in Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sisal08
30,Mmmmmm...Ok.,"We visited on a Thursday when the museum is free. Its a beautiful space, and feels very calm which is a rarity in LA. I liked the collection of works they had, but it is a small collection. I'm not sure I would pay entry price to enter. I also was disappointed to find out they didn't know the female to male ratio of artists exhibited. I would have really liked to know this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateradartist
50,Well-chosen collection!,"This one-story museum of modern art has more than its size would suggest. My favorites included works by Louise Nevelson, Claes Oldenbourg, Lari Pittman, Corita Kent, John Baldessari, and Franz Kline. At the time of visiting, Thursday evenings had free admission. The gift shop has a nice selection of art books and magazines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanSusanin1613
50,Fun Time,Came here when it was free one weekend. We did have to wait in line but it went by fairly quick. The art is very unique and you probably wont be able to find anything like it at other museums. Would reccommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/constancescalia
40,We visited the Geffen Contemporary--kind of out there--get a docent!,"Price was right--FREE on Saturday and perhaps all the time through March, check the website. Parking is amazing right in front. The building itself is a refurbished police garage! We enjoyed our visit because we lucked out and joined a very knowledgeable docent tour. Do the same--you will appreciate this art MUCH more when you have an idea what you are looking at and the artists' stories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007
40,Check exhibition info online 1st!,"Check exhibition info online 1st! some good some crazy stuff! several bicycles clumped together is ART? A stroller is an ART? Two lawn blowers are ART too? come on, give me a break! But nice Miro painting and other surprise artists. $15.00 buy it all. meutermedia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeuterMedia
20,Not for serious art admirers,"As an art lover and an artist myself, I was extremely disappointed with this viewing experience. In fact, I would say I didn't even have one. Every time I wanted to get a better look or inspect the work closer, a docent was quick to run over and warn me to stay back. At a sculpture, I wasn't allowed to view it from all angles. At a painting, I wanted to point out something interesting to my husband, but I was told to step away. I even overheard a docent chastising another patron when she leaned in for a closer look, telling her she wasn't even allowed to BREATHE on it! I was treated like a child who cannot be trusted. If MOCA wanted its patrons to keep their distance, I wish they'd install barriers, put the art under glass, or put in brighter lighting so the art could be viewed more clearly from a greater distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethD108
50,Manny Farber,"We went on Thursday night when it was free to get in. Focus was on an exhibition of Manny Farber. It was very well curated, and the works chosen to complement different aspects of Farber's work were perfect. Lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverViolet
40,Comprehensive Collection!,"LA was experiencing something that they have not experienced in a while - a rainy day, all day too. So the perfect day to be inside and look at the totaly amazing and comprehensive collection of contemporary art in a beautiful building on Grand Avenue.We probably went through a bit faster than I would have liked but we wanted to get to the Geffen MOCA since it was included with our admission ticket. A wonderful display of art from the permanent collection including an entire room of Rothko's and a special exhibit on Manny Farber and ""Termite Art."" I was not aware of the prolific and iconoclasitic nature of Farber' creative endeavors and it is obvious his oeuvre could only have happened in Los Angeles - it all came together through him. There could be more places to sit for a minute to view the art, but the museum, all on one level, permits an easy flow from gallery to gallery. A wonderful afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twomartinilunch
50,Great as always,Had not been in years. Great collection - all on one floor - 1/2 their permanent collection and 1/2 rotating collections. Have a whole room of Rothkos - always top notch - did not disappoint (except for the parking ticket outside - so be careful of that.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsNinaG
40,Interesting collection,"We visited the The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, North Central Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, USA which is a branch of the MOCA. They have collections of two artists Zoe Leonard and Laura Owens. I found that that the collections are impressive. While Zoe's collections(mainly photography) are quite humble in their expressions, it conveys a deep feeling of care towards downtrodden and impoverished. I was moved by her ""My president"" memo. On the contrary Laura owen's collections are quite expressive , bold and audacious. She has brought out her bold and rebellious attitude on the canvas and all her work very well. It is quite obvious that she has lot of fun during her work and it is quite evident in all her work. The museum itself will take about 3 hours, if you are a serious art lover/critic. We went on a christmas eve and we could not make it to the other branch of MOCA in downtown as it closed at 3:00 PM. The facility is quite a good one with polite staff. Some of the gallery attendants were quite knowledgeable, where I could engage them in a productive/intellectually stimulating conversion. The ticket covers both the museums, but unfortunately we could do only the one on the central avenue , next to the Japanese National American Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srivathsa_kn
50,Great collection,"This is a great museum, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about it since they have a pretty large collection with some well known artists. Free on Thursdays 5 - 8pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristine4412
50,Surprisingly Good,"I'm not really a contemporary art museum fan but I was staying downtown and this was walkable. The collection is pretty impressive and all the big names you're looking for are here. They have a good temporary exhibit and a nice cafe with really good lemonade. Most impressively, on weekends they have middle schoolers act as docents and explain the art to you, that was my favorite part. I'd be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sal_Paradise767
40,Trying hard but still a little brother to others,"I first visited MOCA as a member before it was even open, I was invited to a grand opening reception of the brand new 'space' before they had installed any art, for the previous few years they had operated as the Temp Contemp (Temporary Contemporary) which is now the Geffen. I think I spent two hours there, in an empty space. That is about as much time as I just recently spent there. Yes, they have masterworks by master artists but something just doesn't click with me. The previous day I was at The Broad across the street and found it much more enjoyable, plus it's free. MOCA charges $15, if you have a Metro TAP card you can get 2-for-1 tickets, but if you come by yourself it really doesn't do any good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
40,Worth a Visit,"We visited the downtown location of The Museum of Contemporary Art. It has nearly 6,000 works in MOCA's permanent collection. The museum's exhibits consist primarily of American and European contemporary art created after 1940. I enjoyed my visit through the exhibits, but probably would not need to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurer1234
40,LA's Contemporary Art Venue,"With some financial underwriting from The Getty, you'll find several outstanding works here. I was amazed at their collection and also the temporary exhibitions. If you come on Thursday this summer, watch a Getty restoration specialist clean up a Jackson Pollock masterpiece - No.1 1949. You'll also find a room devoted to Rothko and a section for Rauschenberg. For another month there's an amazing photo exhibit showing Arbus, Brassai, and Goldin. It's worth watching the 42 minute video of 700 Goldin photos set to contemporary music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
40,Modern Art Museum in Downtown most folks don't know about,"My friend and I visit a museum (or the Huntington Gardens) once a month, as we enjoy each other's company and love to see new places. No one I knew, even LA natives, that the MOCA exists in downtown across the street from The Broad and Disney Hall. The admission for seniors was reasonable and the museum didn't disappoint. The highlight were the special exhibits of photography. The modern art was good and not so good, but the museum is so clean and bright with large modern rooms that the energy in there was beautiful. The people who work there were knowledgable and very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieD_12
40,Good,A small section of some nice exposures like James rosenquist and Andy Warhol - max ernst and jean miro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennys34
30,Contemporary art it is...,"If you are someone really into contemporary art (which I'm not) then this is a must go place for you. There are some cool creations, that were quite attractive to me as well, though I'm not a great fan of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satlakhapu
40,For mature patrons,"I visited LA’s MOCA’s with my art appreciative 18-year-old daughter; and although the exhibits were well done, given the mature content of many of the pieces, I personally would not recommend a visit for those under 17. For me, the most interesting display was the restoration of an iconic Jackson Pollock. I was sorry we missed a curatorial talk about the process.I also want to give a grateful shout-out to the gift shop employees who helped us with emergency phone re-charges. I was surprised and glad that the store was able to sell us a portable MOCA charger for an android!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travels-4-Fun-Mom
40,Beautiful building. Friendly helpful staff.,An excellent museum of contemporary art. The Pollocks were memorable. Definitely worth a visit if you are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmN5299NC
50,Visit with my Uncle,"A small museum with an excellent permanent collection. Very friendly and no restriction on taking photos.I particularly enjoyed the Rothko’s, well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899sarbs
40,Very nice,The museum is very comfortable. It isn’t big but the permanent collection was interesting. We like the flow of the space. The photography show was interesting. Overall we enjoyed. A little expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5819PBstevem
50,Innovative modern art,"I love modern art, so I liked this museum. Other reviewers described the exhibits pretty well.If you are going to visit downtown LA, then see this museum and then walk to nearby Grand Central Market to eat. Lots of interesting food choice. Eggslut is the in thing right now.The ticket seller tells you that your ticket allows admission to a second museum about a mile away. We walked there, and that second museum was no good. It's a tiny dark warehouse with some art inside lighted boxes. The saving grace was that Japantown is nearby, and that's a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renetn
50,Awesome Museum! Small but colorful!,"I'm a little surprised to see the range of reviews regarding MOCA. Yes, MOCA is smaller than the highly popular Broad down the street, but it holds its own with its impressive modern art collection and flow of the building. The Rothko room is breathtaking. The gift shop has some funky finds. I think it's definitely worth checking out (I actually preferred it to The Broad because it was significantly less crowded and more manageable). I would definitely go back, especially on a Thursday night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arissalovesart
50,Good museum even if you don't love modern art!,"There is a lot here for everyone. Yes, there is a section dedicated to the multiform paintings of Mark Rothko which I always think of when someone says modern art. But there is also a lot of photography, pop art, sculpture from ""found"" objects, and a lot of interesting conceptual pieces. I am not a modern art lover, but I enjoyed this museum. It doesn't take that long to go through..2 hours or so and we took our time. If you are using LA Metro during your visit, you can get 2 for 1 admission by presenting your TAP card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwillard
40,Thursday visit,I visited the gallery on Thursday. Free entry on every Thursday between 5 to 8 pm. Exhibition was mostly good. Good experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299saurabhg
40,"Good, not great","I was familiar with this museum when it first opened. It was an important update to the LA art scene, and a decent piece of post-modern architecture. What has become of it is interesting - not especially for the better. The architect, Arata Isozaki, must not be pleased with the plastic mural that now coats the Grand Avenue facade of his building. I'm guessing it was done to ""liven things up."" When I visited, half the museum was closed for a new exhibit that was being installed; ticket was full price and a second ticket was provided for free admission. The collection they were exhibiting was part of the core of modernist painting - great works from Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Joseph Cornell, Giacometti, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha, and others. Great things to look at, but still thin for a visit. Although a visit here should be included on any art tour of Los Angeles, this museum is coming up short of its new neighbour The Broad, and the genius of Walt Disney Concert Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101
10,Worst exhibition ever,"This review is based solely on the Adrián Villar Rojas presentation of ""The Theater of Disappearance"" a site-specific installation inside The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA’s warehouse space.I am very open-minded when it comes to art but this exhibition was the least redeeming I've ever experienced, generating no emotions beyond boredom and occasional revulsion. There was no guidance and no explanation of the so-called artworks. And probably no tutorial could have enhanced the experience. We were so disappointed that we did not even bother to go to the MOCA Grand, figuring if this what they chose to display in this space, there was little likelihood of anything thought provoking at the MOCA Grand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7J1AIL
40,Very trendy museum,Spent twelve hours in L.A. with a friend and this was our last stop of the day while sightseeing on foot. It was an amazing museum with very over-the-top art pieces which made it enjoyable to look at. An added plus was passing other points of interest along the way like the Peace Bell and walking by the Disney Concert Hall! I would recommend a visit to this museum if you have time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingCAgal
30,"Knowledgeable staff, small collection","Maybe because I always thought it housed a much bigger collection, maybe because it was right next to the newly opened Broad. It was a nice but not a wow experience. However, if you can coordinate between going to the nearly attractions, then it is definitely worth a visit. There are some great pieces and not a big museum. If you are really pressed for time to see all the things LA area have to offer. I would consider carefully.Nice little cafe - Lemonade next to the museum.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724sc
40,Ping -pond Table,We had a great time playing ping-pong INSIDE the musuem . You will never imagine that you can be part of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teofiloc49
50,Intriguing Exhibits,"My hubby and I enjoyed ourselves here. We saw some interesting exhibits including the Statue of Liberty horizontal and chopped in half - kind of how most progressive folk are feeling right now as our liberty and human rights are suffering an onslaught from an illegitimate ""President."" Don't feel like getting political? Then maybe skip off to the La Brea Tarpit Museum. But if you don't mind controversy and cutting-edge art, check out the MOCA. Our San Diego MOCA is a bit smaller so it was nice trekking through LA's. Everything can be found on one level (except the bathrooms - they're downstairs). The staff were all friendly and knowledgeable about the exhibits. One exhibit was a bit too graphic for children; kinda nice to have at least one child-free zone inside the museum. There was one ""hands-on exhibit where four people could play a game of ping-pong on a table for four with a little ""pond"" in the center. Really unique and fun.You'll see works by Man Ray, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollack among others. If you go in with an open mind and no preconceived notions you are going to enjoy the heck out of this gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattymooney
20,Boring - The Same Old Art,"Nothing new or exciting at this museum. Dull, depressing art. Some art is definitely not for children if you have to have security tell you an installation piece is violent and not for children to see. Have seen this art for years now. Can see cardboard scribbles at peace protest for free. There were a few interesting pieces but all in all not worth $20.00 unless it is free and don't bring your little one. Students seemed to enjoy some of the pieces as it makes you think about world issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailySanDiego
30,Not in line with its neighbor,"A short walk from The Broad you will find MOCA. Arriving by car is not recommended.MOCA is surprisingly small and, in our company's sense, did not live up to expectations.The temporary exhibition of Anna Maria Maiolino became the highlight of the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
30,It's ok,"It's free from 5 to 8pm then. Go then. If you're really into modern art, you'll love it. If you're on the fence about spending $15 on any other day and time to see a bunch of clay ropes thrown on the floor and 15 people standing around gawking about an Ikea mirror, then have at it. Took 20 minutes to pretty much see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGavin
30,A Good Museum,"Art devotees will want to put this on their to-do list, but I have to say it's a pretty expensive proposition at $15 per person for those with only a passing interest in contemporary art.I also have to mention that I found a lot of the display techniques used within the exhibition space questionable. The Joseph Cornell pieces were hung in a decorative manner more suited to a domestic interior than a museum. Lighting was off with noticeable glare on multiple pieces.There are some nice Rauschenbergs, Rothkos in the collection as well as Brassai photographs that I especially liked. Certainly if there is a temporary exhibit by an artist you're interested in you should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookala
40,Highly recommended!,"Excellent contemporary art museum, large, attractive galleries, high-quality collection and temporary exhibits of new art. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roy-Tto
50,A wonderful museum,"simple review. I love museums and we have a wonderful one here in LA. Central to downtown, walkable to the Disney, Broad and Cathedral....and don't forget the Grand Market!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/69FairlaneRagtop
40,Amazing...,The museum of contemporary art is definitely something unusual. It is amazing what the artists can do with scrap and garbage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
40,Check exhibit calendar before going,"We probably picked a bad time to visit the MOCA. This was late July/early August when new exhibitions were being installed so many of the galleries were closed, although were compensated with future tickets for free admission, good any time. I liked the collection, from what little of it we did get to see, particularly the first room with the giant Max Ernst sculpture. Traveling with a toddler, I was great full for the little play area located in the reading room. Just outside the museum entrance is a reasonable priced cafe with outdoor seating. And the gallery itself is conveniently located about a block from the light rail, should you be traveling by public transport. It is also located near The Broad, the Walt Disney Performing Arts Center, and more. All in all, it was a nice visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longstrangejourney
40,"""Something Different from Collections of Modern and Contemporary Art""","I visited this museum along with a conference in LA. Incidentally the hotel where I stay is not so far from the museum.Upon entering the museum I found many collections of artwork with various dimensions.Whether it's painting, photography and a three-dimensional sculpture.Many works that can be called differently from the works commonly found in other museums, perhaps because the work is modern and contemporary, which is different from usual.Many art works that I think are very good and the best art works, and also strange because different ??But there are also some art works that I think are still less worthy to be displayed in the museum.Three-dimensional art work is my favorite ones.Anyway is very important to visit this museum, to know about the art work of modern and contemporary art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0613-SA
30,Some Great Exhibits - but Not Really A Kid's Museum,"MCA has a lot of challenging exhibits, more than many contemporary museums I've been to in the US. They get some great, major exhibits like Weegee and, recently, Kerry James Marshall's Mastry.However it's worth noting this isn't really the best place for kids. There's almost always one exhibit that has warnings all over it or an employee standing outside to warn you about violence or imagery - sometimes things show up without warning. One time my son walked into an exhibit with a bunch of sexual imagery and we weren't expecting it....it was a hallway from one space to another. I don't mind nudity - but not being able to decide to view it before we hit it, or contextualize it, was horrid and annoying...and I found it such a worthless installation, on top of everything.The permanent collection is decent if you're into mid-century contemporary, like Rothko, Johns and Warhol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jays170
30,Yet another contemporary art museum,"Well, I don't regret the visit, great collection of course, but a little hard to compete with The Broad across the street. I guess if you don't have the time to visit both, check out current exhibits they host and see which one suits your interests better. If you're on a tight budget The Broad might be the one to go with, just make sure to book in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627justynap
40,wonderful contemporary art museum,Half the museum was a comprehensive retrospecitve of Kerry James Marshall and it was completely fascinating. Took the one-hour tour of the exhibit from an artist. Was unusually informative and helpful to get perspective and background on the artist and his work. Really enjoyable and opened my eyes to an artist I was not familiar with.The other side of the museum is the permanent collection. Excellent quality. they have a whole room of Rothko's!Is not too large and a perfect close by complement to the Broad for another occasion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeBirdman
50,Great museum,"We took our daughter to LA to celebrate her HS graduation. Since she's an artist, we'd planned to go to the Getty, but it was closed on a Monday. So we went to MOCA, which turned out to be fabulous. Their special exhibit was Kerry James Marshall, who had a tremendous body of work on display. The regular collection was also good, although we'd been to MOMA in NYC in December so that was a tough comparison. Lemonade, the museum cafe, is a nice restful lunch spot with good, reasonably priced food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps804493
50,Multiple Outstanding Museums,"We visited 3 of the branches of MOCA. All were outstanding. 1) MOCA Grand is just down the street from the Disney Concert Hall. We enjoyed the Kerry James Marshall retrospective which has major works by this great African American painter. The eclectic modern and contemporary art was also very good. 2) MOCA Geffen in Japantown which is large enough to handle the large scale work by Carl Andre and other artists whose work cannot fit into smaller venues. 3) MOCA Pacific Design Center which currently has some very strange furniture and teapots by Peter Shire of the Memphis design group from Milan. All 3 museums were fun visits, definitely providing a varied view of contemporary art and design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/areview28
40,See the Kerry James Marshall Exhibit!,"I visited this museum on a culture-packed Sunday. We began our day at the Broad across the street. Lunched at Pez Cantina. Took a docent-led tour of MOCA after lunch. Our docent took us through the permanent collection for about an hour. It was very interesting. There's a lot to like and lot to hate from my perspective but if you look you don't know. I really recommend docents when they are available. Currently and through July 3, 2017, there is an exhibit of Kerry James Marshall. He is a very talented multi-media artist and painter. Most of the paintings are huge and the colors are bold and vibrant. There is much to like in this exhibit. I might try to get back to see it once more and get a docent if possible. Although, I found the painting to be very expressive even without the docent. The story on the construction of the museum building itself is very interesting. See if you can get the story. We were parked at the Broad all day but I believe there is a structure on the same side of Grand as MOCA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
30,This rating reflects the exhibit of Carl Andre,"Andres Mosley exhibit featured mostly large cut lumber of various sizes stacked in unusual ways. Also was a long row of aluminium ingots. Worth looking at and appreciated, not an exhibit that I had hoped to see, from another artist. My timing to visit was only that one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Casertast

50,Museum Heaven,"If you're a museum junkie, MOCA has to be on your list. Recently went for a political discussion. There is always something interesting being offered. The area around MOCA is a cultural haven.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passport247746
40,MOCA Pacific Design Center,"This is a smallish outpost at the Pacific Design Center. This place is larger once you're inside. It's uniquely curated apart from the MOCA downtown, and also uniquely free. It's often worth the visit just by itself. A few years ago I got to see an amazing installation by Jacob Hashimoto (pics here). It's usually more impressive than not, and the price cannot be beat. There's a high-rise parking lot a few blocks away that's covered with extraordinary murals (Shepard Fairey).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocor335
40,Not Up to the Broad,"The LA Museum of Contemporary Art would be a great Museum, if you hadn't seen a great Museum, but unfortunately for LAMOCA, and fortunately for patrons, the Broad Museum is across the street. You can see in the galleries how they, at one time, tried to use natural light, but it just didn't work and thus the glass panes on the ceiling are covered over. The art, under electric lights, just doesn't have a great feel. The permanent collection is okay, but not great, although there are some great pieces. However the special show of Kerry James Marshall: Mastry is outstanding. This is a show that would be at home at any of the finest museums in the world. LAMOCA seems just a bit tired and needs some sprucing up to regain its luster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YayaShare
50,Smallish but great art,"Across from the Broad, we chose it when we couldn't get in but glad we did. The Kerry James Marshall exhibit was quite striking. I loved all the insights in the paintings about how most African American art is invisible. Highly recommend. The Rothkos and Pollacks were a bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobPhibbs
30,A llittle disappointed,I was surprised that the gallery is rather small with a visiting exhibition taking half of the space. While there is a good range of thought provoking exhibits there wasn't enough to hold me there for more than an hour and I was left with a sense of slight disappointment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctoronz
40,Interesting exhibit by Kerry James Marshall: Mastry,"I like to visit the MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, because it's easy to access, usually not very busy and it's a relaxing way to look at art. This time I saw the work of contemporary African-American artist, Kerry James Marshall: Mastry. I was impressed by the simplicity and colorful approach mixed with a serious undertone of African- American life in the U.S. I also took another good look at the permanent collection which includes works by Warhol, Giacometti and Pollock. A nice and refreshing outing. Recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucabentivo
50,The Pollack was worth it!,"Loved the whole look and layout and feel of MoCA. Seeing Jackson Pollack's No.1 was surreal and I appreciated the Warhol's and Rothko's and Miro's displayed.Spend maybe two hours at MoCA then go down to LA Art Walk afterwards. Good collection of artworks and souvenirs at the gift shop, though on the expensive side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaofalcis
50,AMAZING space - got to see the Doug Aiken Electric Earth exhibition,"A rare rainy day in LA meant we could extend our time in here.Such a special exhibition and such a great space.We were there early afternoon for a couple of hours and it was virtually empty, making the exhibit even more special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAH3653
30,"Nice Art, Rude Staff","My wife and I enjoyed the museum pieces, but we're a little confused by their labeling, or not labeling system for the art. I suggest a visit to Chicago's Art Institute to learn how to present the art. Several staff staff members that we spoke to, asking questions about the exhibit, were pert and some were just plain rude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tapetseb22
30,Overpriced,"With the size of the small place, it is overpriced, should have been like $7-9 (it is $15). Not many exhibits and most of them are just ok. Disappointed! Should have been better. Tour guides are kind of annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pooloo
40,Smaller than it looks but still interesting,This is the kind of place that will challenge what you consider art and has some interesting stuff in it. I liked it but was a little disappointed how small it is considering how big the building is. There's a lot of empty space that could house exhibits but doesn't. I don't regret paying the ticket price because they offer some great discounts if you have a metro card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattwA642GO
40,Terrific contemporary art museum in downtown L.A.,"A museum filled with art by well known modern artists as well as lesser known contemporary artists. Encompassing a nice variety, the museum can be enjoyed without spending hours there. Although down flights of steps from the street, there is an elevator available by asking at the ticket window. A small café in the museum's courtyard offers an unusual assortment of food with seating on stools at a counter or at tables in the courtyard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dobbstraveler
50,Needs to be near the top of any TODO LIST,"When you visit LA, MOCA and LACMA akways are a must see if you care about fine art and the sense of what west coast creativity is. Great exhibits curated by the west coasts who's who.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18

40,great,"A museum of contemporary arts, it is a room lavishly decorated with beautiful colours and unique artistic works created only with plastics and natural things. It is an Excellent space for artists and because of its majestic vision it receives loads of tourists every year and has become a must see of Los Angeles. It’s also thrilling to experience a theatre here. There’s a lovely the upper viewing platform where you can see everything. There is a nice movie theatre inside that is a little hard to enter in the dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sumitrajain11
40,Somewhat disappointed,"The MOCA is a good museum, but quite frankly, after hearing all the hype about the Broad across the street, I was somewhat disappointed. In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the MOCA. Compared to the Broad Museum right across the street, the MOCA'S both the general collection as well as the Special exhibitions seem a little tired and lack pizazz!Their collection is worth seeing as their are a number of interesting pieces, especially the Max Ernst sculpture and the Mark Rothko gallery.Not withstanding, if you have to choose between either museum, the Broad is infinitely a more exciting visitor experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724JimB724
40,Small but worth it; includes visit to Geffen Contemporary,"If you love Rothko, don't miss MOCA! Arrive early enough that you have time to take advantage of admission to both centers; free shuttle between them is included. If your eyes, feet, and brain can handle it and you get an early start, you could visit these two and then go to the Broad across the street for a late admission.Beware of the front-desk crew, one of whom is obviously put-out at the idea of having to greet and help people. Fortunately, she is unlike most of the staff; unfortunately, you'll see her at the start and end of your experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanKnee
20,Bizarre,Very few items. I like contemporary art but I didn't understand the pieces here. The Geffen and the Broad are both much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9236AQstevec
50,Must see museum when in downtown L.A.,"I was going to start with the Broad but the general admission line on a Saturday was back around the block. They suggested I try MOCA-Grand, which was pleasantly uncrowded, so I had plenty of opportunity to view some highlights of the collection up close, including Ernst's Capricorn sculpture and the Rothko gallery. MOCA's collection is actually quite large - but this is a small building so limited pieces are on display at any given time. MOCA also has multiple locations in L.A., so if you have specific works you want to see, check the website before you go to see what's on exhibition. But if you just want to get a taste of contemporary art, it's easy access to the arts center and the Broad, and always guaranteed to be interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wheelsupatl
40,Great collection but small,"This museum has a small, but great collection of modern art. If you like contemporary art, it is worth your time. We went on a thursday night with free entry. The Rothko collection is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marleenvdb
50,What a nice way to spend an afternoon!,"We went on a Sunday, found some close parking, enjoyed walking around and seeing the downtown buildings, and going into MOCA - - nice and spacious to see an interesting collection, including Pollock, Warhol, Koons, Rothgo, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artzgal
30,Interesting but small collections,"This was our first time visiting this place. Students price is $6 and regular price is $12. This is a small museum with contemporary arts. It is a nice space and not too crowded. Not much to see here actually, so we finished in less than 30 minutes. Make sure you keep a distance and do not touch the art works. The museum is located underground so you have to take the stairs down. They also have a small gift shop located near their ticket office on upper ground level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thup674
20,Eh,"A few of the exhibits were extremely interesting to see, the others you really just sit and ask yourself "" how is putting these 8 bulbs of fluorescent lighting against a wall ART?"" 12$ for that....... Best display is literally outside the box office.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Streetthiefprod
50,Great collection of American modern art,Well laid out and spacious. Great works mostly modern and contemporary American. I wish I could have touched some of the works and security knew it. ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U8335PTalexanderm
40,"Large space, some provocative multi media exhibits","Caveat - I'm not necessarily a huge modern art fan, but was downtown and figured LA would have a good representation. Some solid standbys (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko), some good work by people I didn't know (though that is a low bar). More multi media than most (figures for LA), the best in my opinion was an immersive work that felt like you walked inside Tron. Worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AggieJoe79
40,"Pretty darned cool place . . . but ""The Broad"" literally across the street is far better!","Some great historical ""contemporary"" art pieces here and well worth the effort. But for my time and money, ""The Broad"" across the street is better. I did like the art and found it interesting and thought-provoking however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanValJeanNAZ
40,"MOCA - small, but satisfying!","The is a small one floor museum of contemporary art! It was easily doable in 1-2 hours with plenty of time to enjoy your favorite pieces. I liked the small size. We took the Metro, so we got a 2 for 1 on our tickets by showing our TAP card.There were many interesting pieces and a docent/guide in each room who could answer questions. They were very knowledgeable and interested in the art. My favorite piece was Hang Over by Fred Tomaselli.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilirun19
50,Small but Beautiful,"While visiting Downtown Los Angeles be sure to stop at one of our newer museums, the Museum of Contemporary Art. It is wonderful. It is not overly crowded ever so you can relax and take in all the art they have on display.This is all contemporary art so no you won't find Van Gosh there, but they have super interesting pieces from painting to sculpture, it is really beautiful.Park at California Plaza, not a long walk at all, so you can get validated. The cost of the museum is fair, about 12$ and they often have coupons you can get--check out Google before you go.You will love this little gem of a museum. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,The Moca,The Moca has some interesting pieces in their exhibit. It is worth checking out when in the Los Angeles area. They also have another location at the Geffen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IAMTHETRAVELGOD
40,Go to MOCA Geffen as well!,"Very compact contemporary art museum with a good variety.MOCA Grand is situated right across the street from the fairly new ""The Broad"", another contemporary art museum. This one has only one level, so if you are a fan of contemporary art, I think you might as well tackle all three (+ MOCA Geffen) in one day. To do so, it is wiser to go on a Thursday, if possible, because the 3 museums are open from 11am til 8pm, plus admission is free for the MOCAs after 5pm.If Thursday is NOT an option for you, and if you are going with another person, and also have the LA metro ""tap card"", show it for a two-for-one price, 2 admissions for $12! As far as parking, park at the california plaza and get validated (validation offered at both MOCA Grand and the Broad) For Geffen, I parked in a parking structure on Central between 1st and 2nd in Little Tokyo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
40,Small musuem that packs a punch,The MOCA as it is called is a smaller museum on one floor with a nice collection of the latest in contemporary art. The collection that is out is small as the display space is limited but it is the most unusual art that you have ever seen. This museum is very cutting edge with the latest works by some of the newest artists. Take an hour or two to really explore this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
40,Compact display,MOCA is set on downstairs on one level. It has an interesting range of installations all set in a traditional clean open space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/675rm
30,One of Best to do downtown,Those who are familiar with most g museums or those who have visited museums of New York may get a little dissapointed. I am not a fan of contemporary art still I can say this is a good one that I have visited so far. There are audiovisuel shows and also free wifi. I was lucky because it was free of charge the day İ visited. It is one of the Best things you can do in Los Angeles downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zehraakpinar
40,"Overshadowed by its cross-street neighbor, the Broad!","MOCA has a good permanent cross collection of contemporary art since 1940's; and special exhibitions. It has been overshadowed by Broad; because of massive personal wealth and special personal taste, Broad's were cream of the crop and more concentrated on selective artists that were their personal favorites. Still worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPDallas
50,Wonderful Museum in Downtown L. A.,"If you're into contemporary art, then you need to pay MOCA a visit. The staff is very knowledgeable about the artwork so, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. The museum features many wonderful modern art pieces. I was impressed with the collection found at MOCA which includes paintings, sculptures, videos, mixed media, and the art installation, Hito Steyerl: Factory of the Sun (through 9-12-16). If you're like me and like to stare at the artwork and read every description, then plan on being there for a few hours. This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRO_13
40,It's free thursday after 5pm!,"This museum was nice, and I really enjoyed some of pieces. I just don't think Contemporary Art is my thing. If it is your thing, then this is the place for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Chrisman
50,Really Fantastic Museum Experience,"We spent about 3 hours at the MOCA Grand. The museum is a big circular walk, from older to newer or the other way around. The staff were incredibly knowledgable and warm. Standing face to canvas with Rothko was amazing. Make sure to watch all of the video pieces, including Steyerl's ""Factory Of The Sun"" which is fantastic and so much more than just a video installation. Spend some tome at the museum store and looking at the airplane parts sculpture outside the store as well. Included in the ticket price is admission to the MOCA Geffin in Little Tokyo. It is a nice 1/2 hour walk past the beautiful Disney building. Have lunch at some little restaurant in Little Tokyo then hit the second museum. MOKA Geffin was also great. The current exhibit, ""Don't Look Back: The 1990's At MOCA"" was very interesting. The 90's was a transformative decade and the art displayed highlighted many of the key changes and concerns. What a GREAT day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
40,Enjoyed our visit,"Visited both the MOCA Grand and MOCA Geffin which are both downtown and included in a day's admission. Enjoyed the Grand, they had a nice eclectic collection of post 1950s art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,Amazing,"Amazing experience in a magical place, it was amazing to be able to see the work of fantastic artists like basquiat and pollock",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elvavb
40,Don't Touch The Art!!,"Of course, don't touch the art, but I use this title in jest! The atmosphere and staff here are incredibly warm and insightful. It is a small museum with a permanent collection and a small rotation. With its modest size, be sure to get a tour!! It's completely free and incredibly insightful. It will truly add value to your experience that you would likely lose otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
50,For art lovers,"if you are seeing some good American art contemporary art scene, this is a must place as this place has permanent displays of Pollock, Warhol, Rothko and many others. It is also an oasis amongst tall buildings surround the museum. entry was $12 for an adult include free tours. Strongly recommend to take the free tour if time allows as the tour guide explain not only the arts in display but also shows the intention behind the curator's view of the pieces that is showing and how each piece is connected to each other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helen591
40,Nice Art Collection,Check to see if they have any free performances on as certain times of years they have Jazz in the courtyard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnconnolly1
50,A Great Collection for Modern Art Lovers,"I'm not one. But I did appreciate what the MOCA is doing and they have fine examples of the ""greats"" from the 1960's modernists, which I recognized. Additionally, there are recent works, which I don't necessarily ""get"", but are fascinating all the same. Because it's not large, and very well lighted and manageable, I think it well worth a stop. I made it a point to get there - modern abstract art is always a learning experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chestnuthouse
40,Great exhibits - just maybe turn the heat down!,"I had to motor through this amazing little one-story museum due to the heat! I visited in February, and wasn't anticipating sweating the entire time I was inside! Great exhibits - will come back when the A/C is on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766katherinep
50,Clever & Intelligent,"For anyone who likes modern art, & for anyone who wants to check it out, this is the place. Such clever & intelligent art. Something for everyone. I lingered not at every piece, but could hardly take my eyes & mind away from many of them. Excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markian
30,Only go if you are a fan of very modern art,A very small museum that can be done in less than an hour. I'm not a fan of very modern abstract art so a lot of this was wasted on me. Especially the Rothko collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCKaboom
40,Small but nice museum,This museum has 5 or 6 really nice pieces in my opinion. It was a nice way to kill 30 minutes. But the $12 entrance fee is a little high for as small as it is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365chrisg
30,Nice albeit Small museum,Went on a Sunday. It is a compact museum that can be done in an hour. When I asked for a museum map I was told I didn't need one. You don't. I first thought that because it was layed out very well they didn't need one. It is layed out well but not very large. Nice collection. Just small.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PBeckerle
40,Good for a visit and a stroll through Downtown LA + Little Tokyo,"A ticket gives you access to two museums. One with the interesting-if-not-great permanent collection and another space with the exhibition. The latter will of course depend of ""what's on"".But still, a good deal + a good excuse to walk between the two and spend a day in downtown Los Angeles, get food at the Market, see little Tokyo etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliep14
30,An acquired taste,"The museum has a small selection of their inventory of over 7000 pieces, currently on display . In particular they are featuring recently acquired works.Older pieces include a couple of Pollack, Warhol and Lichtenstein pieces.Contemporary art is very subjective and I just couldn't connect or engage with any of the other work on display.Extremely abstract work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kardy1
30,MOCA Art Compels But Offers Little Context,"It might be old fashioned to ask that curators offer some context for museum exhibits, but that is exactly what the primary exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles most needs to convince visitors of its relevance. Paintings by Pollack, Rothko, Jasper Johns, sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, and collages by Betye Saar and Robert Rauschenberg are best appreciated by those outside the art world when their relationships to their environment and times are explored. Instead, this exhibit, which was culled from objects in the museum's permanent collection, rests on the links between artists through their friendships, art schools and their interests in each other's works, according to the museum's website. It turns into an investigation of technique and process, one that hardly does justice to the power of some of this museum's collected images. It's easy to visit the MOCA which features a nearby parking garage. The new Broad Museum sits across the street from the Grand Street location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322janetc
40,Modern MOCA on Grand ...,"I've been going to MOCA since it opened but hadn't been in a while. We visited MOCA, the BROAD & had dinner at Vespaio across Grand Ave. The MOCA collection is quite varied and various art from its vaults is on view at different times. Always enjoyable. Took the Metro & it was only a 2-3 block walk. Easy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Interesting pieces of Contemporary Art,"This visit with my kids is really unplanned. We were planning to go to BROAD, parked there and tried waiting in line. But when we realized it was about a 2 hour wait, we decided to explore Grand avenue instead. We were lucky to get a validation ticket so we only paid $12 for parking instead of $22 (whew). The museum is just across BROAD. Ticket for adults are ($12) but my 14 yr old paid $6 and my 8 yr old - FREE (yay). Just realized that the ticket were good for both this one and the Geffen Contemporary - about 7 blocks on Little Tokyo (we walked for about 20 min one way). The place is located at the basement floor. It's small compared to LACMA or Getty. It is not really advisable to bring kids in this one due to the content and the art being abstract - they cannot really comprehend yet. We saw some permanent collections and some of Matthew Barneys work like the River of Fundament and the Boat of Ra. Would love to come back in the future. Both places have shops too. Wished they had magnets though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
50,Great visit for comtemporary art lovers,"We went to the MOCA with no major expectations and were very happy to find some nice pieces of Warhol, Basquiat and Lichtenstein. One amazing David Altmedj installation is worth the visit for those who like David's work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpmessier
30,Just Average,"Was not impressed. Museum has some interesting stuff but in general is not up to the standard one would expect of a 'leading' museum. Quite average really.If you are in the area, and you want to pass the time, by all means do go but do not expect much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndySW8
50,This is a world-class art space!,From beginning to end and with every step I enjoyed the experience here… I have been here quite a number of times in the exhibits are always changing and fresh… There are always a combination of paintings and sculptures and graphic works as well as pencil sketches… I love this place as a display space for the greatest and most challenging of contemporary artists… It is always inspiring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveholden
40,A Treasure Trove,"Contemporary art revealed from its beginnings to current day. Walking through these galleries you can get a sense of artistic development, albeit with a rather sparse commentary (is that a commentary?) offered by the museum. Lots of interesting items to acquaint you with style, medium, technique and an array of artists, many of whom are relatively new on the scene. Would love to have more content about time and space and artistic development. Wish their lighting was better as the glare of the lights really compromises many of the glassed in pieces of art. And, in the first gallery, c'mon with showing a diagram of 10 pieces of art with their description in one fell swoop and then nothing beside each piece...really, who can remember that?! Definitely worth the visit and is a nice complement to The Broad (or is that the other way around...).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,NEW LOCATION NOT ON TRIPADVISOR,Go to the The Broad at 221 S. Grand Ave Downtown LA CA 90012 Tel 213-232-6200Stunning art gallery and building donated by the Broad family. The building alone is worth the visit. The Broads have donated their art collection (or part of it) to the public.It is a stunning collection of famous artists works.I was not able to find where I could review it so added here......it's across the road from the MOCA between 2nd & 3rd.It is so new there is a wait of an hour weather you line up or buy tickets on line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eremitoexplorer
30,Okay - expected more,I thought the place would be larger with more art and more variety.But still worth going - a good collection and enough to see - and not crowded at least Saturday morning,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NivT
40,Comtemporary art in downtown,"The museum if one big loop of contemporary art. At the present time, they are showing more works from their permanent collection. And the artwork is way better than I remember it from many years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandiR81
10,A joke,"Indescribably disappointing. On paying to get in we were told that half the gallery was closed and that, as a consolation, we were being issued with a ticket which would allow us to return for free on a future date of our choosing. These tickets never expire, but they'll have to do some major development for us to bother returning. Even with double the space this gallery is very small. There's barely anything in it. I'd defy anyone to manage an hour looking at the art (we managed 15-30 mins and we were dragging it out).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricWhite74
30,Visit if you are in the area,"We were a bit disappointed with the museum, perhaps because we had been to LACMA the day before and expected something similar. It is quite a small space and although it contains some interesting work at the moment, including a good video installation, a lot of the space is given over to the career of Sturtevant, an artist whose work does nothing for me. Maybe check to see what they have before you come along. Certainly worth a visit if you are downtown, and you can go to the Grand Central market afterwards for eats. I wouldn't make a special effort though, there are other spaces in the LA area which are worth that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2823RUchrisa
40,Small but well selected,"Since they were in between setting up temporary exhibition only half of the museum was open, but this was well worth the visit. Small selection of modern art, presented in an spacious and open way, very accessible and giving right to the artists. Well worth our time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoachimFuchs
40,Kahlil Joseph Double Conscience Kendrick Lamar,The Kahlil Joseph Double Conscience double screen Video was worth the price of admission. It was deeply moving.

40,"Great use of space, manageable size.",2 hrs well spent. Actually a very cool space in an architecturally rich area of downtown LA. Great collection really well curated. Write ups are extensive enough to help you really see the work well but not too over the top art speaky. Big atypical Warhol exhibit while we were there but the exhibit write up was helpful in understanding how to see it. Wide selection of key 20th century artists. Id go back in a heart beat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s0j0urner

20,Wouldn't go out of my way for this,"To be fair I must say that half the place was closed for renovations when we visited. Perhaps it will be much improved when that's completed. Also, it not my favorite type of art. Some of the pieces were kind of interesting or humorous. We stopped in to spend some time one afternoon while staying next door at the Omni. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again. Fortunately their little cafe had a glass of wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CapricornSister
30,fine for an hour,"This is by no mean the best museum in La and they do have couple of key signature piece (giacometti, raushenberg, mondrian), but the rest is sparse. The exhibit on stuyvesant was not good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfizzle
30,Somewhat disjointed,"Well, we went on a free night. That's good. As soon as our little grandson saw the paintings and 'exhibits' he began to cry! We felt somewhat the same. Explanations of the art were on small placards lacking in dimension in relation to the larger sizes of most of the works. So much was repetitive. It was very hard to follow any thought behind the groupings, time-wise or theme-wise. We found it very difficult to take in. Although we are art-lovers, we were confused as to how we should learn from or appreciate this exhibit. Perhaps we are more adept at discerning meaning from art of earlier centuries and better rehearsed to appreciate the master artists of the past. I think, however, the museum might try harder to make contemporary art more accessible for present day appreciation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AriaProf
40,small but excellent collection,"I was surprised that MOCA is only one (large) floor, but their permanent collection is excellent. Currently they have several Robert Rauschenbergs on display, as well as a Jackson Pollack and a Mark Rothko, among others, and you can get super-close to them and really examine them for detail and spend time with them. I also appreciated that they had several groups of young students there -- don't worry, they weren't running around the galleries, the teachers had them sitting near one or another art piece, asking what they thought, what the piece made them think of. That's how you create the next generation of art fans. If you can get to MOCA before August 16, see the exhibit Kahlil Joseph: Double Conscience, a video presentation that I found both fun and heartbreaking. And don't be scared off by how small their cafe is -- the food is fresh and inventive and delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardsmom24
20,Disappointing,"The Jackson Pollock & Mondrian pieces probably saved the day for me as otherwise, it would have been a huge disappointment. Half of the museum was closed & although I was given a ticket to return free when it reopens, I was just visiting so paid $12 for a very short visit which made me feel ""Is that all there was?"" at the end. There were a few other interesting pieces, but not enough good ones and too many really weird ones, some very sexually explicit pieces that made me shudder as two groups of school children were touring the gallery, surrounding an adjacent piece in full visibility of a very explicit piece of ""art"" running the entire length of the room, which young students were able to read. Why not include contemporary art that can actually inspire & amaze instead of shock & embarrass. There is so much good art that it was depressing to see what was being presented to anyone, let alone young would-be artists, as something to rise to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuvallDesdemona
40,Very Happy I Went To See The Collections.,"MOCA is a very good contemporary art museum in downtown Los Angeles. It's across from the Disney concert hall. I parked in the concert hall lot, walked outside and to the museum. They display Lichtenstein, Kline, Ellsworth Kelly, Pollock, Kooning, Twombly, Emin, Terry Allen, etc. It's a very decent collection and easy to view. The rooms are basic and display well. The Warhol Exhibition was interesting. I did enjoy viewing, but admittedly preferred his displayed drawings in a NYC gallery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
40,Contemporary,"Guided by the contemporary artist friend to see this around. Could there be anything better than this? However, they were organizing exhibits last week so there were quite limited work on display. They did give us free voucher for future admission and yet we had to go..Overall, a very good place to be, in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonfung888

40,SPACIOUS,"Spacious, well lit and easy to walk around and enjoy the artwork. I love modern art and enjoyed the collection here; some really interesting pieces very well displayed. An Andy Warhol exhibition was being exhibited when I visited and the monumental pieces fitted well in the large rooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seatseeker
50,Love this Museum,"While it's not MoMA (NYC) it is a great museum located in downtown LA. A wide variety of contemporary artists, and if you love 20th century classics, when in LA make it a point to go to MoCA. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithStephen

40,MOCA,"I am not usually a big fan of contemporary art, to the point that if an itinerary of mine has proven overly ambitious, it will be the contemporary art that faces the firing squad. But MOCA has never, in scores of visits, disappointed. It also has a nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Great museum!,I'm generally not a fan of contemporary art and generally only last about 20 mins. This place is the exception for me. I went through it twice and revisited my favorites. I loved it and would recommend it to others!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beckitex1
50,Take the Tour,"When my sister and I visited the Moca Grand Avenue, one weekend, we were able to join an ""Exhibition Highlight Tour"" which was just forming in the lobby. The tour lasted for approximately forty-five minutes and was led by an interesting and well-informed ""professional gallery educator"". The tour was conversational in nature. Therefore, I was able to have all of my questions answered which contributed greatly to my knowledge of the contemporary art exhibited and added to my overall appreciation of the museum. If possible, take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13
30,Disappointing if compared with other Contemporary Art museums,"I went to MOCA with my daughter who studies art in London. We are use to go to art museums in Europe, Asia, South America and US.We were quite disappointed, since the 2 temporary exhibitions were not that special and the permanent collection on display either. We have seen much better choices in other museums. The curator seems to have a preference for art that tends to be primitive, almost kindergarden stuff or sometimes with not that much talent shown. Even the works from Mike Kelley on display were not the best choices.I know that taste in art is something very individual. I'm not easily critic towards modern and contemporary art, but in case of MOCA, my daughter and I were really disappointed. Of course there were some interesting works as well. Maybe next time, in another temporary exhibition, the Museum can show better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuPereira
40,"If you like contemporary art, you'll like MOCA","MOCA has good representation of the basics of modern art, but I think they shine with their special exhibits, most of which are truly contemporary, in that the artists are still living. They show a broad spectrum of multi-disciplinary arts, and it is quite entertaining. Even if you don't like one exhibit, you're likely to enjoy others. You might even find you enjoy parts of an exhibit while disliking other parts. It's all part of the stretch that contemporary art imposes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sablatt
40,Good overview of modern masters,"Stepping in the the main gallery, you are immediately presented several works by modern masters: Giacometti, Klein, Basquiat, Baldessari, and others. Further in I really enjoyed the substantial collection of Nan Goldin photography. Check out the Thursday 5-7 pm free admission if you've only got a short period of time to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimdagOG
40,Great!,"An interesting mix of wall art, installation art and film. We loved it! Easy to get around even for those who can't climb stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cando
50,tasty exhibits,"An excellent permanent collection, starring Rothko, a favorite. Hardly contemporary in years, but fascinating use of transitional color and texture.We saw the clowns, life-size statues, bizarre, menacing and powerful. There were other exhibits using form, lights, color and unexpected materials which were engaging on many levels. This museum is very good at selecting exhibits of high quality, technically and intellectually.I will say, as in most museums, the art is not cutting edge. You have to go to galleries to see really contemporary art. Selection of work to exhibit in museums is a process governed by consensus of staff who are rarely artists, rather art historians who favor who they are familiar with and who are known to be good. Thus one sees a lot of the same artists all over the country. They sell tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniel_M515
30,What a piece of...kindergarten art.,"I was disappointed right away, because the focus is on stars (as in Hollywood). Also, it is advertised as free on Thursdays, but is only free after 5PM. I paid the entrance fee, and my kids were free, sooo. I was advised that some exhibits were not suitable for children. I was not worried, because my kids are urban, and I am very open about sexuality.I'm sorry, but this was a horrible experience. All the things people make fun of were there - the blue canvas...the broken glass as art, naked people having sex with dirty feet. Mike Kelly - hmmm I can get that on Utube. Ouch, that is not art.There were a few pieces I enjoyed, but my eleven year old son summed it up perfectly, ""This looks like stuff I did in Kindergarten."" I hate to admit - I agree.At other museums there is a quality permanent collection if you don't like the featured show. Not so here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joh09o
50,Great exhibits - keeps getting better,I love visiting this museum with my children. There are several locations so be sure to determine which exhibit you want to see before parking or you might be in for a long walk or taxi ride to the correct location. Today we visited the Geffen location to see the Mike Kelly exhibit. This is an amazing space that feels like a warehouse. I have seen other exhibits here and I always enjoy the edgy feel. The exhibits are laid out well at all locations. There are interesting places to eat within walking distance of each location. If you go to the Geffen location in Japan town you will have the opportunity to try amazing restaurants. We love Ozero for a treat - it is a cool specialty beverage place and I can promise you will be happy you stopped there versus the Starbucks across the street. If you go to the main location you might consider eating at the cafe inside the Disney concert hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
40,Nice with a few issues,"This is not a big museum and difficult to get to. They have no parking (but an arrangement with the music center quiet a walk away, which was a problem as we had someone who needed a wheelchair in the museum. The parking that is closer (California Plaza) is very expensive ($40). That said, they were quite helpful with getting a wheelchair and the galleries are accessible. The permanent collection has some nice things, but is small so you should want to see the traveling exhibits. The small restaurant ""Lemonade"" is excellent and a lovely place to stop before or after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLA1016
50,Intimate & Inspiring,"My favorite downtown modern collection, super gift shop and Disney Concert Hall is across the street!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurel817
40,Weird art,"I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of contemporary art, so most of the pieces here just leave me with a weird expression on my face. The museum itself is well done though, and, for those who actually appreciate the style, I imagine it's well curated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
40,A Gallery of Truly Contemporary Art,"The MOCA is a place that will alienate some and elate others. This museum lives up to its name. It's full of TRULY contemporary art. I'm an art nerd and there are pieces that I'll admit I didn't ""get"" but wow, what a sensory overload! The gallery space is small so you won't feel overwhelmed. A couple of hours is all you need to fully peruse all of the pieces, making this a great place to add to your list of things to do while visiting downtown Los Angeles.There are some great works in their permanent collection representing pop art, postmodernism, minimalism, conceptual art and my personal favorite, abstract expressionism. For every unknown artist on display you'll find pieces by the masters of modern art: Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Mark Rothko, Hanne Darboven and more. You are allowed to take photos in the museum but ONLY of the permanent collection exhibitions. There's a groovy museum store on-site too so be sure to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moviegal226

I recall as a child, watching in wonderment and being part of that exciting 60's, 70's fashion evolution. I recall helping my mother supplement our family income, hand-sew and hem such garments. Matter of fact, my entire family sit together and sew many afternoons.A small shop in our neighborhood outsourced the finishing touches to locals.Check out the se photos of a slice of fashion history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells

20,A couple of Drinks prior could make this more enjoyable.,"J Paul Getty section was impressive with great pieces. The rest would take mind altering substances to appreciate!!! Not sure what the acquisition committees are thinking? or, who's money they could have better spent??? A trip to your local elementary school art exhibit would be a better use of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnP589
10,Appalling collection of trash and decay,"So, the major exhibits were a small house made out of bread, that had been decaying, molding, drawing bugs for about 100 days, an installation of an old, ordinary grocery shopping cart surrounded by some chain link fencing, construction and street trash swept up, with an American flag in the shopping cart, and installation of day glo painted vegetables hanging from the high ceiling by plastic wire, and, in the family reading room, a graphically violent video of people stabbing each other. Wish we hadn't wasted our money or our time. Reminded me of the center of government in The Hunger Games where the privileged spend time and money on every more frivolous crap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MnM1112
50,A must visit,"This is a really nice space. Not the largest selection and part of the gallery was closed, but what was on offer was perfectly selected. The Franz Klein paintings made my day.I think it's a must visit as the MOCA has some intensely interesting pieces of work that are stimulating talking points.The space is lovely and airy, very nice to escape the LA sun and soak up some wonder.The adjourning bookstore / gift shop is really good. A great array of local and international magazines made for great choice. The book selections are perfect with so many inspirational, unique offerings rather than the mass famed artist books that most museums pack in. I loved all the local artists prints, books and mags.A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobbyboysabout
50,A Great Guide (Deborah Cohen)nd a Great Experience,"We arrived just in time for a guided tour. Ms. Deborah Cohen introduced herself as we waited for my husband to join us. She immediately began to ask what we knew about art. She said ""how will I know what to tell you if I don't know where your coming from."" This began one of the best guided tours I have experienced. We found out that at MOCA contemporary art begins in 1945. The end of the war. We marched forward decade by decade. She compared different.works in the same room while encouraging questions and providing fascinating tidbits about the artist or their medium. Who knew that huge off white canvass was showered with caviar and each tiny piece was numbered? The artwork was phenomenal. Ms. Cohen's commentary made the art accessible to anyone. She is a treasure!For seniors the admission is $7 each, but it is good at all three MOCAs on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texas1964

It is most amusing!Just look at these photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Extraordinary collection and great exhibitions,"The room filled with the paintings of Marc Rothko is reason enough to visit, but there is so much more to enjoy. Last week I attend the Urs Fischer exhibition and it was one of the most remarkable installations I've seen in recent years. This is a great space for great art and very close to the Walt Disney Concert Hall.Service in the café is terrible, but the food is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pblythe
40,Good but small,"MOCA apparently has different campuses, this is the one on Grand Street. The collection of works by Swiss artist Urs Fischer is fascinating....particularly the raindrops and the house of bread (note the official names). The levitating fruit is tasty, and melting lamppost brings to mind a poem by Aleksandr Blok. (""Night, street, lamppost, pharmacy...etc."") There are only two halls and it doesn't take long to go through them...so I wish the $12 admission price were somewhat lower.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99LuftBalloons
50,Interesting art and installations,"I'm not a fan of contemporary art - I've never really understood the appeal of installations, but Urs Fischer blew my mind. What better way to show how ephemeral life is than giving clay to however many people, asking them to make something with it, anything, not firing the pieces and then displaying them all in a room, whether they fit with each other or not, to watch them decay and fall to pieces. I do not know one painting that shows the transience of life better. I enjoyed the other pieces or art, too, but Urs Fischer will forever stick with me and I will make a point of checking cities I'm visiting for his exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeM718
40,Fascinating,This is a really unique and fascinating museum to go see. There were so many unique pieces. So worth spending an afternoon and getting lost in all of the displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeastMode36
40,What is contemporary today?,"The MOCA lately went through some stormy times, but this is not what should be of any concerns as long it fulfills its main purpose: To present great Contemporary Artwork. Until January 2014 it mainly focuses on parts of its Permanent Collections, good to become familiar with the last decades not as exciting if you are keen to learn about new trends in the art world. This need is satisfied by looking at the temporary ( Until September) exhibition of Los Angeles based Artist RETNA, which was opened on April 21. His work is due to MOCA Director Jeffrey Deitch totally contemporary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RGerman
30,Not MOMA!,"I was expecting MOCA's permanent collection to be exciting, challenging and more diverse. Disappointing museum for a big city like LA. The items in the museum shop were overpriced and poorly presented. Wake up MOCA, you can do better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenriC670

I particularly love the diverse (in all manner of speaking...age, race, sexual preference, education...you got it!) of the free monthly workshops. They compliment the museum, exibits and the artists.

50,Destroy The Picture Exhibit,"I wouldn't usually be attracted to this kind of exhibit but I have to say it was thoroughly enjoyable. We had an excellent docent who probed our reactions to the artwork and helped us truly appreciate the experience of the artists and what may have prompted their creations. Without the docent, I think I would have breezed through without fully appreciating and enjoying it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930AnneR

50,You MUST GO TO MOCA,"well, modern art is not for everyone, but this museum in the heart of downtown Los Angeles has the real feel of this city. You may have to brace yourself for the power and shock of some of the artwork, others artwork is classic, pleasing, historical, charming and pushes our emotions one way or another That is what art is supposed to do. Most of the installations here are amazing multimedia displays that will really create a memory for you. Check the exhibit calendar before you drive out there, unfortunately they are not all 'family friendly"". It is educational and amazing. Don't be surprised if you get goosebumps. Hopefully there will be a great exhibit or concert when you go. I've been a member since 1984.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624

30,unfortunately some of it is closed,"nice musuem, we were told that some of it was under construction so we were given additional tickets to come back sometime and I was impressed that they dont expire. so took us less than an hour to see, if $ is tight you might want to pass until all the exhibits are open",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riverwest
20,What a disappointment! Don't waste your time unless you just want to help a struggling museum.,"I should have read up on this museum before visiting. The website made it sound like ""The Place to be"" but it was ""The place to avoid"". Its in financial and management trouble. That would have tipped me off. I paid to get in- and then they gave me a free ticket to come another time because half the exhibits were closed. I said that I am from the East and unlikely to return but they would not refund my money. I went in and - boy- not much to see. The permanent collection is old as the hills and hardly qualifies as contemporary in my book. Mark Rothko, George Segal - Give me a break. Don't waste your time here- go on out to LACMA which has an entire contemporary building donated by a board member who cut his ties with this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer

40,You made like this or not....,"Art is in the eye of the beholder and there is a lot to behold at MOCA. Depending on your artistic preferences, you will like and dislike many items in this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChinoSJP

30,LA's Museum of Contemporary Art,not muchdifficult access and parkingboring exhibits,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brassiarex
50,compact but essential,"when downtown, make sure you visit MOCA. it's a very compact museum and when I visited half of it was showing something I was not interested in. still, the other half was the home of some of the most amazing paintings in contemporary history, pollock, rothko, kline, etc... yes, it's pretty bizarre to showcase such incredible opulence and have so many homeless people pushing trolleys on 6th street. LA is a place of extremes. if you are into art, it's a must. I also found the bookshop really good. and great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satori99
30,Poor Parking Options,"Hard to find parking during the week and it's very costly (as much as $25). The museum is, I think, presently under some renovation so not all the galleries are accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
50,Fun Fun Fun,Always a blast with so much to take in. Definitely a must see for adults & kids alike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2remem
40,Loved the Rothco's,"This museum has a fascinating variety of collections. However, the Rothco room when you first walk in is almost a religious experience. Only complaint is that there is not a bench in the room to enhance the experience, there is enough space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philip-USA
50,Give it all your support,"It's so great to have a world-class art museum tucked away downtown. When you've been in meetings all day, it is a refreshing change to see what's happening in this small but important museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuffCrone
40,Friendly and accessible,"I highly recommend going here on a Sunday morning. The parking is easy, you can stroll around easily, and there are no crowds. Have lunch at their little restaurant - it is quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
30,Matter of taste,"MOCA Bunker Hill. Maybe just me, but this intellectual cannot see what all the fuss is about. Their exterior pride large sculpture is of wrecked aircraft parts, which should have clued me in. Also that the brick low building is supposedly some kind of architectural masterpiece, again not in personal world view. Could not locate any ""Cafe""; closed one or more weekdays depending; you either love or disdain the exhibits.Admission buys visit to a larger museum somewhat to the north the same day which may be even better for aficionados of more refined taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smarteconomist

30,"Little tokyo exihibit was great, the rest not so.....","Visited the MOCA and found the art there to be not to our taste and the gallery was fairly small. There was a temporary exhibit of Warhol's soup cans but there was no photos allowed I would not recommend this gallery for the youngsters.Now on to the good bit. Down the road at little tokyo there was an exhibition on called Art In The Streets, OMG why cant they leave this here permanently? Featured art from the likes Of Banksy, Invader, Neckface, Andre and an amazing sort of documentary by Spike Jonze.This ends August 8th so I guess the museum will go back to another middle class artsy type hangout and lose the energetic magic it has found over the last couple of months.Do yourself a favour MOCA, keep it street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorna2011
50,Little Tokyo & the Geffen Gallery at LA MOCA is a great family outing,"If you want to experience cutting-edige contemporary art and some Japanese food, culture and fun shopping, visit LA MOCA's Geffen Gallery in downtown LA's Little Tokyo district. You don't have to be a ""museum goer"" to enjoy Geffen Gallery at LA MOCA. Visiting from New York, I have been a big fan of Jeffrey Deitch who has been making contemporary art accessible and exciting to the masses in NYC for more than a decade. Deitch, ran the Deitch Project in NYC's SOHO, and is now the director of LA MOCA. While vacationing in LA with my 20 year old daughter and her friend I was eager to see his first major exhibit of Street Art. Little did my daughter know that for the past 6 years, on our trips to NYC, she has enjoyed many of Deitch's projects. The Art In The Streets project was phenomenal with works by Keith Herring, Banksy, Fab 5 Freddy, Lee Quiñones, Futura, Margaret Kilgallen, Swoon, Shepard Fairey, and tons more. I'm sure Jeffrey Deitch will continue to impress with future exhibits. Afterward we crossed the street to the Little Tokyo plaza, enjoyed a delicious sushi lunch and shopped in the very entertaining Japanese shops. Lots fun, something for the entire family or any age group, kids or no kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rancheroAlbany_Ny
30,Nice Museum,"This museum is close to the Disney Concert Hall and worth stepping by. Entry is free on Thursday late afternoon. The collection is decent, American art after 1945. Not all is equally good or interesting, but there is a good variety including not just installations, but also paintings and photography. Most of the rooms are underground and the building itself is less interesting. The museum shop had some nice gifts, more than some other art museum shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karabiber
