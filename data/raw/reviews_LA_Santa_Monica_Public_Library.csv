50,Amazing Facility,"All right, it's not the NY Public Library, they don't have every book ever printed, but for a small city library it surpasses expectations. Its clean, modern layout and decor is well lit and comfortable, the staff is friendly and helpful and the selection on the shelves surprisingly good. You can easily spend a day browsing because you can get a rather nice lunch or snack in the cafe in the courtyard where you can munch and read surrounded by a stream-like fountain and shady trees. The library has quite a calendar of free lectures, readings and films as well--something you should work into your schedule if you'll be in town for a few days.",Cornelius T

30,Big library but doubles as a homeless shelter,"There is a good selection of books. And you could also pick up some bargains in the secondhand bookstore. Set against this is the fact that the entrance on Santa Monica Blvd. was nearly blocked by homeless people. And there were also homeless people sleeping at the tables in the interior courtyard. It may be politically incorrect but the city would be better served if they were alternate arrangements made for the homeless. As it currently stands, I would be reluctant to bring young children to this place, despite the impressive selection of books.",vincemc

On this my second visit to this library for research (thank you Alice and the team of reference librarians), I was able to hone right in on what I wanted to do and spent a few hours the Sunday of Labor Day Weekend in a very productive state of mind. The library is bright and airy and modern without feeling high-tech. I was happy the Bookmark snack shop was open, too.

I could not have done it without the librarian's help. I am a big proponent of libraries and when I lived in Santa Monica, during the time of the old library, I didn't find enough time to spend there for working so much. It has a lovely courtyard with a cafe, surrounded by a succulent/cactus garden. It was a great experience.",Sabrina N
40,spacious library with a cafe inside,"This main branch of the Santa Monica library is modern and spacious. There's a small courtyard with a cafe where you can buy some snacks and drinks and read outside. The free wifi is consistently available, but gets slow on weekends when there are a lot of people using it. There is quite a lot of seating with some comfortable couches inside too. The only thing I don't like is that there are usually homeless camping out in the couches inside and depending on how close you sit to them, it can smell bad and is distracting. That's why I prefer the courtyard/cafe area.Overall, it's a great place to read and study.",HollowTurtle

Free wifiBAD:If not a Santa Monica resident, they charge an annual fee for use.Plenty of homeless and those with mental illness using it to sleep, shower and hang out.

50,It's a building full of books.,"It's a library. You have to run a gauntlet of Santa Monica's homeless asking for money to get out of the parking lot and into the library.

50,Way beyond research and book-borrowing...,"Not being a resident of Santa Monica, and therefore not a borrower from its public library, I guess a review from me that thus cannot take account of the range and quality of its book and other holdings must count slightly as false pretenses. So be it… I’m going to stick to writing a review and giving a five-star rating because quite frankly I’ve never come across a public library elsewhere in the US, or indeed beyond, that presents quite such an immediately friendly and attractive face to its public, from the lofty air-conditioned interior to the comfortable, planted outside courtyard complete with a café run by the same excellent outfit that owns the estimable Bud’s Famous Deli in Ocean Park Boulevard a couple of miles away (see TripAdvisors reviews elsewhere). What really pushed me to this review, however, was discovering by chance SMPL’s really terrific program of concerts, movie shows, and children’s and literary events… specifically in this instance an afternoon (free of charge, be it noted) symposium on local resident Christopher Isherwood. This was fascinating, and became really touching and memorable with Isherwood’s surviving partner Don Bachardy, who still lives nearby, reading extracts from their letters to each other. Looking ahead, there’s a plethora of comparable events coming up for Santa Monica’s lucky residents. Long may this obviously well-funded and vital public service to the City continue.",davidjbrown10

Sadly it is also the home of bathrooms which brings many less fortunate to hang out and sometimes weird out there but given the wealthy city's lack of anything much but places to sleep nearby for them means it can be more interesting than most libraries.

The fixtures are nice top of the line brands not cheap things you see in other libraries so there is a lot pride in it's design. Some non-fiction books are not available here so I would check in advance...the check out is easy and the people are nice and helpful. If you suggest for them to order a book, it is usually there in a couple weeks, this I found impressive. They have a decent DVD movie selection as well.

They wheel out on a regular basis a trolley of free books to take as many as you like.,Pauline T
50,"A peaceful, yet stimulating destination.","This library has it all. Lots of great special events, a kids section that is slightly separated from the general populace which is nice and also there are computers for kids, etc. There is a central outdoor courtyard with a cafe to sit and work, wifi throughout and you can reserve private study rooms. It's a great resource and a pleasant place to go.",AFoolForTravel
50,Finest Library In the USA,"The main branch is spectacular. Bright, cheery and filled with every book title you can name. Free computer use. Affordable printing. Lots of free programs & lectures. User friendly. I love this place. The satellite branches are okay, but cannot compare with the main branch on Santa Monica Blvd & 6th St.",cuppajoe2
50,Beautiful Library in a great location,"This library is fairly new, and has wifi, but it also has tons of movies on DVD, and tons of books on tape, as well as every great book you'll ever want to ready. You have to love the staff, too. They are so helpful. If you can ride your bike here, you'll do yourself a favor as I've never actually figured out the parking situation here.",Suziselt
50,Excellent local library,"Nice facility with a good selection and a large selection of reading, listening and viewing choices. Well worth a visit and if a local a place to use regularly.",Chingachgook
40,Library visitor,"We have a tradition of visiting the local library whenever we go on a trip. The Ocean Park branch library on main street was the smallest I've ever been in. Literally, just one room. But it was a pretty building with a nice garden. The main library was very large! It had one of the most extensive non-fiction sections I've ever seen and a beautiful outdoor courtyard. If I lived here I think I would thoroughly enjoy having access to such a tremendous library.",ColoradoDitto
40,A wonderful find,"A lovely peaceful and quiet haven in Santa Monica, free wireless internet if you need it. A multitude of magazines, should cater for all tastes. Looks like it has good research facilities as well as there seemed to be lots of people studying. A courtyard has chairs and tables plus a coffee shop for refreshments. If I lived in Santa Monica, I think that I'd spend a lot of time at this library.",SuaGiLo
10,Library museum rip off,"Waisted $5 per person on Santa Monica museum which is in the library . They have two rooms, couple of old dresses, twenty pictures. Do not worth my time and money. Beware.",Janeandnathanel
50,"Comfortable and clean, nice hideaway for research",I frequently go to this library - everything is very user friendly. The design is beautiful as well.,MiCasaEsSuCasa
30,An okay place...,"I came here with my 3 year old and on a rainy day when we were unable to visit the beach as we had planned. They had an okay section for little ones with a few puzzles and a decent book section. However, not much more. I know its a library and libraries are about books but I am used to my local library that has a few more interactive/learing activities for toddlers.",MGabil
50,Great place to read magazines and good collection,I really used the services to stay engaged during the years I was lucky enough to live in Santa Monica.,hikerdadlvp
