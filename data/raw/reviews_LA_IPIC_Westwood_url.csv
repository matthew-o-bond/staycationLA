50,It‚Äôs like watching a movie on your couch!,"The iPic Theaters on Wilshire Boulevard near Westwood Blvd. in Los Angeles is almost as good as being at home, except here you have someone to bring you food and drink right to your plush, reclining seat. The grading of the seat tiers is such that you never have to struggle with the heads of moviegoers sitting in front of you. And if you get bored with the movie, just grab the pillow and blanket provided and take a catnap!The sound quality is great, the theater is large enough that you can choose seating as close as or as far from the screen as is comfortable for you, and the seats are spaced sufficiently so you don‚Äôt feel closed in by the person next to you.They serve both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. The menu is varied, offering snacks, sandwiches, entrees, and desserts. If you decide to try something, go for the Truffle Oil French Fries. The portion is large enough you can split them, too!The theater provides parking.

50,Wow....,"So, this is what's become of movie theaters? Being from NE and Central NY, I never knew...My son took me to see ""Beauty And The Beast."" (He's 45. I won't say how old I am.) I was shocked by the level of comfort...reclining seats, retractable table, pillow & blanket. And cleanliness...even the restroom was spotless and very chic.I didn't have high expectations for the food - figured it would be deeply fried frozen items from a food distributor. Was I surprised to learn that the food comes from a chef in an adjoining tavern! We shared the Buffalo Chicken Rolls (REAL chicken, right amount of heat, no oozing of secret sauce onto our clothes), the Filet Sliders (yes, REAL filet of beef) and a Lobster Roll. Coming from NE, I was a bit skeptical about the lobster, but my son said it was very good.Some people think the menu is pricey, but I think $18 for 3 beef filet sliders is pretty decent. I would much rather pay a little extra for good food than throw money away for frozen junk food. Oh, I forgot...free popcorn too.We had reservations, so I guess that's the way to go. My son just had to pick up the tix at the window.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KuriousKat2
40,Very high end movie experience but make a reservation,Hard to get in to see a picture here if you want the reclining experience. Also they assume you are in groups of two so odd numbers work it out! Great reclining seats and even blankets accompany you to your seat along with a full dinner and drink menu.

40,Great theater and service,"I've gone to the iPic Pasadena location many many times for many years. Once December 17 came for the opening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, there was only one place I wanted to see it and it was at iPic Pasadena. Unfortunately there were no more tickets left. However there were plenty left at iPic Westwood. My fiance and I bought our tickets for New Year's Eve 2016 in the early evening so it wasn't as busy as a usual Thursday evening.ServiceThe service here was great. Each time we pressed our service button, our server was prompt and responsive. My only gripe was that near the end of our movie, I needed to ask our server a question regarding our bill; it wasn't a big deal but I just wanted to clear an issue. As the credits rolled and patrons filed out, I pressed our service button but our server was nowhere to be found. In fact, all of the servers were gone, which is strange because they don't leave until all patrons have left the theater. After waiting a few minutes, we tried searching for him but still couldn't find him. Again, this wasn't a big deal but I didn't get my billing issue resolved so I just let it be.FoodThe menu here is different from the one in iPic Pasadena, which was a breathe of fresh air because iPic Pasadena hardly ever updates their menu. I got the short rib grilled cheese with fries and the fiance got a lobster roll with baked potato chips. Both items very good and I highly recommend. Once the movie started, we were handed our complimentary popcorn, which is always perfectly buttered and salted.AmbiancePerfect for a date night or to chill with a group of friends. There's the restaurant Tanzy in the same location as this iPic so it's perfect if you want to grab bite before/after the movie. The actual theaters are located upstairs, which you have to take an escalator up to the second floor. There is a bar on both floors so there's plenty of chances to obtain alcohol or appetizers. Although this iPic location is in Westwood, it's still a bit of a walk from the hustle and bustle of Westwood where all the shops and restaurants are located. Comparing this iPic location to iPic Pasadena, the points go to iPic Pasadena because their location is right in the heart of Oldtown Pasadena: I can get ice cream, pie, pizza, cheesecake all within a block radius. But at iPic Westwood, I would have to either walk to the action or leave my parking spot (which I already paid for) and drive to Westwood and find another parking spot to pay for; either way, iPic Westwood isn't convenient for quick access to shops and restaurants.OveralliPic Westwood is just as good as iPic Pasadena. However, I would only go to this location again if I can't get my desired tickets at Pasadena. Otherwise, I enjoyed my experience here.+Good service+Different menu from iPic Pasadena+Perfect for a quiet, entertaining evening-Inconveniently located from hustle and bustle of Westwood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boogiescience

50,When you want more and can pay,"We came here to see Star Wars and it's definitely out place of choice when we what to splurge on comfort and service . I dream all movie theaters would be like this. Parking is easy and best to park right behind the theater . With validation it's 3 $ instead of 24$. We ask have a membership and get some extras with it . The theater is almost like private screening with reclining chairs and little tables . Super comfortable . Don't watch an art movie here you will fall asleep. The food is pretty much all finger food .. You order from your seat, give them a cc and they charge everything you choose to consume during the show.Now the service at the bar and the counter could be way friendlier and interested in customers. The actual seating waiters are fab, friendly and caring without bothering you. Not sure where it goes wrong outside the door . We have been a few times here and now skip any drinks at the bar as its almost as if we bother the staff.Unless you have the money and can afford to come here for every movie , use this a trip for a special movie. We saw Star Wars here , Star Trek, James Bond . I don't think I need to spend 54$ a couple to see some meaningless comedy .Visit is a must, experience is unique",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristost2016

Great beers on tap, and smallish but ample meals can be ordered at your reclining seat before the movie. Super-sugar laden desserts if you really want to indulge. Can't fault this place.

I ordered the calamari sandwich for me and my wife as we just had dinner couple of hours before the movie and we really loved it. Popcorn will be served to everyone for free and you can ask for refill anytime. I really recommend Ipic movie theaters to anyone who love luxury and love spending time watching a good movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316fahmim
40,Luxury movie theater with great food,I was a frequent movie goer at this movie theater and loved ordering the different drinks and the creative food and enjoying the wonderful service from the bartenders to the waiters that come to your movie chair. The recliners with blankets are wonderful to cozy up to and watch the movie. I honestly spent a lot more than you should spend for a regular movie.I guess they had to raise their movie ticket prices by more than I was willing to spend out of pure principal and haven't went back since. It just gets to a point of when they start taking advantage of people because of the popularity or they are going under. Not sure which is the case but for me not worth the price of admission any longer as a frequent movie goer. Maybe every once in a great while now will I see a movie there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolandh871

The seat was comfortable and service was helpful and attentive. Loved the Homemade Ginger Beer and the free popcorn, but having just eaten I didn't get to try anything off the menu. Had one drink in the bar beforehand but didn't want to drink so was recommended a non-alcoholic strawberry daiquiri. Mistake! I'd expect a non-alcoholic drink to be in a tall glass with lots of ice. I got a small martini glass with a rather unpleasant strawberry flavoured drink inside. I expect with the alcohol, you'd enjoy sipping it, but not without it and not for $12. The Homemade Ginger Beer inside the theatre was delicious and tall and with ice and was only $6‚Ä¶ so take note if you're visiting on a 'dry' day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rijima
40,"food, fun and comfort","We enjoyed the comfy recliners, pillow and blanket. The food was really good and our first server was fun and funny, but we were the first to arrive so the only four in the theater. After the place was packed, our second server forgot to give two of our party their popcorn, but they got it upon departure. Unfortunately all four of us reviewed the popcorn as way too salty (ridiculously so). It did limit our desire for and consumption of what should have been unlimited popcorn with the seats we purchased. We were in the first row of the ""better"" seats and I would have preferred to be up a row and in the middle and definitely NOT in the lesser priced seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatPlay411
40,A very nice venue,The iPic Theaters is a nice venue. The seats are very spacious and they recline. They are two seat per section which I think is very cool.They Also give you a blanket and pillow per seat. The middle arm doesn't go up between the seats so if you're looking to get cozy with your companion it's tough.The screens are decent size and the sound it pretty good.Lastly the food is not bad at all and they have a full bar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pauljalessi
40,iPic is Top Notch at a fair price!,"You will be spoiled for going to a 'regular' movie theater after attending an iPic movie theater. The food and drinks are delicious.

Sherry Yard's food is wonderful and perfect to eat in the dark while watching a movie.The seats are comfy and you get a blanket and a pillow! It's like watching at home but with a very attentive wait staff. My only criticism is the size of the screens. They are somewhat smaller than most theaters. It is fairly intimate and cozy. You are not on top of your neighbor though. There is plenty of room to spread out.The movie selection is pretty much what's in your neighborhood multiplex. Not a lot of art films here.It's pretty hard to go back to normal theaters after seeing a movie at iPic.

50,"Large Theater, Upscale Experience","Coming from the Phoenix area, we have our fair share of dine in theater options. Needless to say, we are not quite on the SoCal level ... yet. We frequent the Scottsdale iPic, and always enjoy the experience however, the Westwood version has our home town version beat IMHO, for the theater experience. In terms of immediate surroundings, things to do, and location, Scottsdale wins hands down...once again, IMHO. The LA version used iPads for ordering, and the theater was HUGE. In comparison, the AZ version (as of last visit to see Hobbit Pt.3) was sans the tech in a much more compact setting. Customary attentive service, plush leather seating (in contrast to AZ suede), and a large theater in which to branch out, made a very good impression on the family. Parking in the garage in the building next door was ... interesting. Missed the turnout because of traffic and due to downtown feel of location so, be more attentive than me. Regardless, good time overall, and the kids enjoyed the 532nd rendition of Cinderella. Next time in LA, we'll try the Pasadena iPic, and perhaps the Cin√©polis since we have yet to try it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Girded_Up

40,Great seats and nice screen - warning: Bathroom shortage,"This is luxury - in terms of theater seats, experience and customer service. The limited bathrooms is shocking (and possibly a deal-breaker for us). All the movie seats are reserved - the premium seats were the first two rows of the theater we were in and would have been too close for us. We opted for the full-premium plus experience ... a reclining seat that came with a pillow a soft blanket - instead of cup holds there are moveable tables. I like the trend of having reserved seats at the movies -- here they were easy to find and easy to get to. The premium plus seats have waiter service to bring you food and drinks and the menu is a full menu that would do any restaurant proud. In fact when you walk into the ""theater"" you are in the lobby of a full restaurant and bar. If you don;t have the premium seats then the line for food looked quite short and accessible - the BIG drawback is the restrooms. We have never been to a movie theater with a single stall restroom - one for men and one for women. This is not so bad before the movie but I just had to take a break during the movie and was greeted by a line at the single-stall restroom...this is not acceptable. Since I don't usually take break during the movie this probably won't be a problem; in fact I cannot remember the last time - but it was a shocker today. There is easy parking (valet and self) attached to the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_a_lot4fun

Another glitch in my opinion. Everything else is great. To us it is worth the difference in price, except the bathrooms did bother us. We will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ppepe99
