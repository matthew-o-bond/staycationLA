50,NEON CRUISE,MONA offers a NeonCruise of downtown LA...at night on top of the double decker bus you see tops and sides and details of buildings built 100 years ago or more...the guide is great and there are two stops - one in Koreatown and one in Chinatown...lots of fun and it's 3 hours of visuals you never see from walking or driving on the streets...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84trudig
30,Different,Lunch was goodDifferent art museum if you like the abstract art ( not us)The outside building was terrific,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irenef2
40,Popular attraction,Spent 3 hours at Mona while visiting Hobart on a cruise.Interesting museum with lots of unusual exhibits. Recommended but found a few hours plenty of time to spend there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bradpitt2016
30,Great works of Neon but only one room,"It pains me to give a Neon related Museum only 3 stars, however it was less of a museum than I was expecting with only one room. Putting that aside the room was expertly curated with some fantastic pieces. If you want to fill half an hour this is for you but if you are wanting something more substantial head to The Broad or go downtown in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiannaS539
40,"Cool, quick stop","We attended a walk-thru tour with the museum director on a recent Friday afternoon at 12:30. These occur regularly, I think, and greatly enhanced the experience of this small museum. She took us into the lab where students create neon works and showed us the tools and mechanics that are used. It was very interesting and gave us new insight and appreciation for the neon works by artists that we saw next. Yes, it's a small place that would seem more at home in Las Vegas where neon is a way of life, but for a unique, quick stop, it's worth a visit. And you get 90 minutes of free parking nearby (unheard of in LA), so why not?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivanabhip
20,Calling this small display a museum is an exaggeration.,"2 Star Fair Rating, not because of the great display of neon, but to call this one room display of neon a Museum is misleading. It should be ""Nice small display of Neon"". $10 admission and won't take longer than 30 minutes even if you read every description.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmarzy
40,Interesting exhibit at this neon musum.,"Our Car Club visited M.O.N.A. on a Saturday afternoon. Wonderful display of vintage, neon signs, and interesting little video to watch in a back room. Just wish there were more signs, but space is limited. They do change out the exhibit every so often, so I plan to return again some day. Before or after go to lunch,or for a snack or baked goods at Lemonade across the street for fresh, tasty food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynW98
40,Small and Unique,"The exhibit changes every several months. We viewed classic neon signs, mostly from the L.A. area. A unique museum which is basically one large room. We liked it. I believe classes are also given at this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanMcK
40,Retro cool!!!,"A true gem for someone who enjoys vintage Americana. The museum is small but also the signs are large. Remember, these were meant to catch your attention as you are driving. At eye level they are quite big. I wanted more but I understand the challenges they have. I know my $10 will go to help save and restore these endangered beauty's. For an even better experience I recommend the Neon Cruise (bus tour). It's a bit pricey but totally fun. Eric Lynxwiler is an amazing guide!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean92802
50,A new gem in Glendale!,"This lovely, and lovingly prepared, museum has recently opened in Glendale and I had the pleasure of visiting a few weeks ago. The staffers Gregg and Kim were gracious and helpful. And oh, what a collection! Time travel back into mid-20th Century Southern California: the Van de Kamp's windmill, the blinking OK Used Car sign, the spectacular Spanish dancing couple, the adorable ""Hiya, Folks!"" frog -- absolutely stunning. I can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/877kathleenv
20,Size matters.,"We were eager to visit this museum and the greeter was very kind & helpful, but it was extremely small. It's one room. It's a full room, but one room nonetheless. Also, since some of the art is pulled from Instagram then you only see about half that is actually neon signage. Cool, but not worth the $10 ticket or the Uber ride there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyr667
30,Interesting but needs more,"We were really looking forward to this museum, but were disappointed. Although it has some cool interesting neon signs, there aren't very many of them on display. It's more like a gallery, than a museum. We were looking for information about the signs, such as where they came from, how old they were and how they came to be in the collection. Finally, realized there was one book that had some information in it, but someone was looking at it, so didn't get the opportunity. There was a sign show hanging, too. The information on them was limited as well. Liked the neon hairpin light in the women's bathroom and the signage outside. Again, there's a good start, but needs development.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711monicah
10,Um... This is all?,"I love neon. I love museums. This place is a HUGE disappointment. There are very few signs displayed in this tiny facility.From the outside the museum looms large and full of fabulous signs. But beware, the actual museum is the size of a large garage with only a few signs amateurishly displayed.It's a shame since this concept could be presented with impact and beauty- not to mention multimedia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRVLtruth
40,Glendale Location is Small but Mighty,"One of the most important things to note is that MONA is about preservation and documentation of older & historical pieces. Signs that were in danger of being destroyed have found homes with MONA.If you are serious about signage, MONA is your type of place. It is small but has some lovely vintage examples currently on display. A Jantzen swim girl is fixed on top of the building and a couple dozen restaurant and store signs (lit and unlit) are on the floor. This is only a small part of MONA's holdings.However the display rotates approximately quarterly, so you might see more contemporary pieces on your visit. Call ahead and inquire or check the web site.Entry to the museum ranges from $5 to $10. As mentioned by another reviewer, they have monthly ""cruises"" where they drive through areas and point out neon of note. Knowing my entry fees/membership go to conservation of this predominantly American art form makes me very happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jays170
30,A Tad Disappointing,"We, my wife and I recently returned from LA, CA visiting a son and daughter-in-law. I had signed up for something somewhere that came to my inbox on a weekly basis, called LA Weekly. There was a review of the opening of the Museum of Neon Art recently relocated from Downtown LA to new digs in Glendale. Looked intriguing from the review and from the website as well. We planned to visit. Well, it was not all that a guest was led to believe from reading and viewing the website. Everything that they show, and hence make you believe you will see, is not all currently on display. The one-room exhibit, off the lobby/gift shop was all quite current, none of the antique items that are displayed on the website that the website implies is part of the permanent collection. There is an extensive collection of clocks above the ticket booth, which would be fun to look at a bit closer but they are not at eye level. The museum offers others things, a bus tour at night of Hollywood/LA neon, that would probably be fun to do in conjunction with the museum, but we did not have the time. So, if it is able to expand, I might return for a follow-up visit, but not unless I confirm that what I want to see you can actually see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twomartinilunch
10,Not as advertised!,"The web site has photos of lots of old signs which I recognized from my youth. Brown Derby for example. But, the actual museum consists of one room with primarily contemporary pieces. A very limited offering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noni40
20,"The museum closed since June, 2011 per their website. Expensive, disappointing, problematic bus tours.","MONA is currently trying to raise funds to reopen in Glendale. The downtown museum location is permanately closed.The organization doesn't know when the other Glendale location will open. Maybe the museum will improve with more space at the new location.Bus tours are still given at night time from a street corner. Their website is still active.About the neon lights cruise, conducted on second floor of an open double decker bus:Our travel group went on this tour and it is very cold, even with warm clothing, expect wind burn on your face. The employees said I should have worn a ski mask.Our tour guide gave us both historical information and nonsensible trivia. We were told tales of lights which no longer existed on freeways and buildings, without any pictures of what the signs would have looked like. At one point, our docent commented on the large rat population of Pershing Square. However, I liked seeing the classic restaurants like Clifton's at night.It is hard to get a good picture, in the dark, from a moving bus. Also, be wary to low hanging branches, trees and freeway underpasses, so do not stand up while the bus is in motion. In addition, the architecture is difficult to see at night. Another problem with the fast paced, nonstop tour is both seeing the lights and getting the information at the same time.This will be a different way to view Los Angeles and surrounding areas, not better, different. The cost of the tour is $55.00, per person, for non-members of MONA. We were very disapointed in the expense-versus-quality of this tour.We decided NOT to take the Holiday Lights cruise after this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catnewman
