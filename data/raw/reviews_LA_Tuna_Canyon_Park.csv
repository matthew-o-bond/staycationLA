40,Good Hike w Beautiful Views,"My friend and I decided to hike the Tuna Canyon Trail after reading that it's one of the most popular trails in Malibu. It was a little challenging finding the trail head because you can't access it from Tuna Canyon Road off the PCH. But once we found it, the trail was great. You get awesome views of the ocean and the peaks of the Santa Monica Mountains. We had a bit of a hazy day so it wasn't as picture perfect as you'd hope, but still pretty stunning. And the trail is deceptively steep on the way back so save your water and energy for the hike back. We spent a couple of hours hiking and felt pretty sore and satisfied after.",Sassysandyg
50,"SPECTACULAR VIEWS, EASY HIKE","A short drive from Santa Monica, Venice, or across from Topanga Cyn, there's a gorgeous hike that'll take you to the edge of the cliffs overlooking the ocean, LA on the left, and Malibu on the right. Oh and there's a labyrinth too. Enjoy!",tomasreyes
30,La Tuna Canyon from I-210,The canyon drive includes several places you can pull over to access the trails. The first access point is directly off the interstate. The parking areas aren't very big and traffic moves fast. No facilities.,"Double ""Ollie"" Winner"

40,Beautiful Nature Exposure,"We are avid promoters and partakers of exercise. Primarily walking or hiking). The drive west from Hwy 101 toward Pacific Coasy Highway is a thoroughly invigorating experience. We stopped at Topanga Canyon State Park. You can go to the main gate and pay the per person fee of $5 or you can stop at the entrance parking area on your left. Restroom facilities [exceptionally clean and modern] and picnic tables are available there.To the west (right) of the tables is a trail going up the mountain side. This trail leads to the Triplett Ranch and is an excellent nature hike or walk with great views of the mountains.You should be in fairly good physical condition to manage this hike/walk. I am 78 years young, but walk 3 to 6 miles regularly.Continuing the drive west are numerous businesses, restaurants etc. scattered along the canyon. A small mall is also located on the right side entering the village of Topanga.Upon reaching PCH (Pacific Coast Highway, a left turn will take you down the ocean side toward Santa Monica. A right turn takes you North to Malibu and beyond. Nice ocean view drive to Port Hueneme or Oxnard/Ventura area.All in all a real fun one day trip!!",Miles H
