40,Nice brewery in an attractive area,This is a nice and friendly brewery with some good beers. They serve food too. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was great. They do have growlers but no crowlers in case you want to take some beer home.,Femtosecond
40,Craft Brews,"Kinetic has a nice vibe, a good variety of beers. The food is really good, different, but limited. For example they have one burger, but it's fabulous and the Blvd, dog is great !! Home made catsup and sauces !",gerryclaud
50,Fun environment,The environment is one of the best on the BLVD. They have the best pretzels and fried pickles too! Never disappointed,lgxthatsxme
20,I don't get the appeal...,"I have been here a few times over the last 3 years and I do not understand why locals like this place so much. The food is not good and they almost never have their ""famous root beer"" available. The names of their beers sound pretty awesome for aviation lovers, but the taste is nothing to write home about. There is always loud music playing, so it feels like you're in a bar with pipping hot food that has no flavor.",Crystal P
40,Poutin in SoCal!,"Beer was OK, but the burger with poutin on the side was awesome. Fried pickles had a bit too much breading. Homemade chips should be eaten plain for the best experience (IMHO).",X--ROK--X
50,Sandwich and Sampler Anytime,You can't go wrong if you're a micro brew novice like me. Try the various beer samplers and you won't be disappointed. Sandwiches are plentiful and make a great before or after show meal or a great place to meet friends day or night for a couple of beers that are anything but ordinary. I'll definitely be back!,RLDrPH
50,Great place.,"Kinetic is a great place to spend the evening eating good food, drinking great brew and people watching. They are also pet friendly on the front patio!",Sharon D
50,"More beer, please!","I do a lot of traveling for work, and one thing I always do is check out local breweries when I get into a new town. Enter Kinetic Brewery- modern brewery meets Edwards Air Force base. Clientele of all ages and backgrounds- military, business, hipster, blue collar.... A good selection of brews as well as other breweries' selections. I prefer strong IPAs, and they have a few. Sad to learn that Afterburner was done, but I got to have some on my first visit. Food is good, not too filling to displace the beer, but tasty enough to satisfy the need. Sit indoors or outside if the music is too loud. Located in Downtown Lancaster where you can stroll down the sidewalk and take in the vibe.",saul s
40,Great Brew Pub if Always Loud Doesn't Bother You,"I enjoy the variety of beers served here (correction, my HUSBAND enjoys the beers, I'm not a beer drinker) but I especially like their fish and chip days. They are soon good, best thing on the menu. Other than that, the snacks can be a bit lack luster. It's always noisy, even when there's no one there, they keep the TV or the music at top volume. Wait staff is usually good (had a few not-so-happy staff) and it's a good, solid place to come to hang out with friends.",EllieRKay
50,Another place to visit on the BLVD,"Great place to start and end the evening, we started with a Potenial Blonde Brew, went across the street and enjoyed a good movie in a theather made for adults, we finished the night at GBG where we enjoyed a great dinner.",inspectrdad
30,Kinda Stark - Service Sucked,"Breweries, I guess, aren't known for killer restaurants. Except that in my home town they do pretty darn well (we live in a top rated beer town so our vantage point taints us).This one is very stark. Reminded me of the Firestone brewery in central Cal, which I was not impressed with at all).Not well appointed. Not well decorated. Tables suck. Ours rocked badly and we had to swap it with a nearby table so that our food and drink didn't get dumped on the floor.Service was horrible.Yes, we were seated quickly. That is it though. They weren't quick to come take our drink orders, and even slower to get our dinner orders. And EVEN slower to serve the food. And oh by the way, slow to bring our check.Prices typical of a brewery but we won't go back.If you do go, try the fried cucumbers. Good! House beer. Good. Food. Mixed bag. Some at our tables said good and some said not so much. Mine was good. But service and starkness of the place will prompt me to not go back.Oh by the way, I used to live in Lancaster. WTH did they do to Lancaster Blvd? Parking and even driving there SUCKS!",Sixeye
50,What a gem!,"Went for dinner and beers after a long day at a soccer tournament with several parents and players. The beer was great. I had Propulsion IPA and it was great. My friend tried several beers, including the amber, porter and an ale and thought they were all great.The onion rings are amazing and the boys enjoyed their burgers and a pulled pork sandwich. I had the blackened fish tacos and they were tasty. The beer is the obvious highlight but the food is great too. The space is pretty cool too. The wait staff was nice but a but slow overall.",53bethk
