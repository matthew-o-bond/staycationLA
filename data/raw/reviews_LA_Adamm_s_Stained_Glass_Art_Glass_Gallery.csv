50,Art glass gallery well worth a stop,"With a few hours to spend before taking a flight out of LAX, we decided to visit downtown Santa Monica and check out the Adamms Gallery -- and it turned out to be a great decision. The trip over there took less than 40 minutes on a mid-day Thursday, and there is a public parking garage on the corner hardly half a block east of the gallery. (For the hour we were there, there was no charge for parking.) The gallery itself seemed like a riot of form and color; there are pieces everywhere, and since they sell works of many artists there was quite a variety of styles, sizes, and themes to peruse. Prices were about commiserate with what I've seen in other urban galleries. Our party settled on two very different pieces and arranged for them to be mailed. Adamms packed the pieces very securely and they arrived a few days later in perfect condition. Overall, a very agreeable experience from start to finish. We'll look forward to visiting again the next time we're in the Santa Monica area.Note: in late-May, that nearby parking garage was undergoing renovation, and so it was a bit of a chore finding the ground-floor kiosk to validate our ticket.",kay-cee-1138
50,Not a museum but worth visit.,This is an art glass store but if you like glass it is like a museum. They represent many glass artists and there are many works on display. There are other nice art objects but glass is the main attraction. The pieces have a wide price range and are of high quality. The owner is one of the premier experts in stained glass restoration and has done many large projects including churches. If you like glass this is your place.,Morris K
