50,Great park on any day! Located in a neighborhood very quiet! Neighborhood market right across the street!,We went to this park several times a day while walking our dog or skateboard! This park has a great location that not many people know about! You can definitely find a bird scooter all charged up and ready to go in this location! Many people who love in and around this park pick up after their pets! They do have water fountains and bathrooms! Many people workout or have classes in the park! Great open area with plenty of benches! Nice clean park!,Yehbut

40,"Nice Park, Primarily Locals ...","Hitch kiss Park is a neat green belt known primarily by neighbors and Santa Monica locals - it's a bit off of the tourist paths. Only about 6 blocks from the beach, with some views. Also is about 6 blocks south of Shutters. Lots of trees, open green spaces, benches and picnic areas. Fun to lay on the grass & kick back. Enjoy! .....",David B L
40,Cute park with clean bathrooms and ocean view.,This is one of the cutest parks in Santa Monica. The bathrooms have been recently remodeled and are clean. But the best part is the ocean view.,Yseut
50,Gr8 local park but not tourist attraction,I live in walking distance and go here almost everyday as it's a small nicely maintained park. But I am also a consummate traveler and want you to know that this rating is based on my love of this park and not as a recommended tourist spot.,RLGalloworth
