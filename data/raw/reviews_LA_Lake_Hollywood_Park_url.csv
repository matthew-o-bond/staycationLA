50,Awesome place to take Hollywood sign photos,"Awesome place to see the Hollywood sign and take pictures! Lots of winding roads to get up to the park, but there is some street parking. The park itself is pretty small - really just an open grassy area with little else. Some people had dogs and others were picnicking, but it's mostly a spot in a residential neighborhood to get a great picture of the iconic Hollywood sign. Beware that cell service can be spotty up there. I took a Lyft to the park, but then lost service and I was worried about getting a ride back down. Luckily I had a nice Lyft driver who waited for me to take a few photos and then took me back down the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonh511
40,Good spot,A laid back beautiful spot to take pictures with the iconic Hollywood sign. Reasonably near and feasible parking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Somosmita
50,Great view,"If you don’t want to missed the opportunity to have a photo of this iconic sign in Hollywood this is where you want to go, is not the closest to the sign but you will get great photos here, you can do the walk but is not as close as it looks, there is an awesome view were you can see the lake and the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FJPonzio

10,VANDALISM to cars but great photo opportunity,"BE CAREFUL. We parked the rental car in this beautiful neighborhood the afternoon of December 31, 2019 only to return to find vandals smashed the rear passenger window out in an attempt to steal...nothing! We leave nothing in the car and they found nothing. The rental car did have an out of state license plate. We were parked on the corner of Tahoe Drive and Tahoe Place. Directly behind us was another vehicle that also had their window smashed out and they had money stolen that they stupidly left in the car. The police arrived and wrote out both our incident reports at the same time. We are not sure if it was actual vandals or cynicism about the residents doing this because they don't want tourist parking on their street. For the good side of this location: walk up Canyon Lake Drive and you will come to a dirt trail (as wide as a car) called the Innsdale Trail. It is beautiful and a wonderful location to take photos of the sign. I listed this as a 'terrible' rating purely so that this review is read. It is a beautiful location to visit as long as you are aware of this warning ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian07663NJ
40,Nice view of the Hollywood sign,"This is a nice park with a playground and a good view of the Hollywood sign. I didn’t see restrooms, but did see a water fountain. If you want a better view of the sign, you can walk up from the park through the neighborhood to a higher viewing area. The route to walk up, is, from the parking area, walk up Mullholland drive, turn right on Durand, Left on Heather, Left on Ledgewood, Right on Rockcliff, Left on Deronda. At Deronda and Mulholland, walk around the gate on the foot path and walk just a short ways up for a really nice view of the Hollywood Sign. Note that it is a very pretty walk through the neighborhood. You could try to drive part ways, but there isn’t much parking and some of the above route is blocked to cars. So if you have the time, walk it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
50,Spectacular!,"Every tourist who goes to Los Angeles, visits this spot. Although if you want to walk up to the sign, it takes you 2h each way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruditea
50,See the Hollywood Sign,"Lake Hollywood Park is probably the best place to view the famous Hollywood Sign without doing any major hiking. Once we found a parking space, we walked up the hill, went past some neat cactus plants off to the side, then we found a few spots to take some great pictures. A great visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HOCKPOOH
50,Beautiful park,"We came to this park for an unobstructed view of the Hollywood sign (on my son’s vacation wish list). It’s a beautiful green park with a playground for kids. There were lots of people with their dogs or using the park for exercise or recreation. The drive here is narrow & windy, so drive carefully and use caution at blind intersections. Breath-taking views from here too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelliplansitall

50,Amazing chillout zone,I wasn't there with doggo. I wasn't there with girlfriend. I wasn't there with friend. I just went there with Ford Mustang Convertible to clean my head. And the roads are extremely enjoyable! If you are that kind of person like me who likes to clean his head by driving some enjoyable car then if you are in LA this place is MUST GO! Best corners out there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmckennedy
40,Nice clean small park !!!,This is for the people who want to view the Hollywood sign in close.No other work here. 😀A small park here to engage your children.We can take pictures of us with hollywood in background... really visible in all our photos.. that's cool...Parking is free on roadside.. go on non-peak hours to get stress free parking..I went around 3.30 PM and saw lot of places to park.. Enjoy the world famous landmark!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anandhabharathij
50,Closest view of Hollywood sign,Have been visiting LA for 20 years and tried all the usual spots (Griffith Observatory etc..) and a few less common (Hollywood Reservoir) but this was the closest and clearest view without hiking.The park itself is nothing special. Make sure to drive or walk the road beyond the park to get even closer. Beware there is no parking beyond the park and traffic control was operating the day we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
40,LA is a different place up in the Hollywood Hills,"We came to this park for the same reason as everyone else, for a photo opportunity with the Hollywood sign. The sign was exactly what I expected and we took some great photos from up there but the biggest thing I noticed was how much of a different world it is up there in the hills compared to Hollywood and Downtown LA.I'll be honest, I did not like Hollywood or LA, I could not believe how much of an issue there is with homelessness, and no one seems to care, these people just seem invisible to the locals then you go 1 mile in to the hills and it's dripping with gold. LA has got this all so wrong, how can movie stars live the lifestyles they do when there are massive problems on the streets just under their noses. Speaks volumes and has really opened my eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNatster75
50,"""We have the photographs""","You just can not go to LA and not get your own photos of this iconic sign, we got ours while near the concrete ""Casting Couch"" bigger than the original and not as soft.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore694115
50,LA visit,"We are in love with this city. We recommend Santa Monica Pier and Hollywood Blvd. Be careful and accepting to take pictures with people wearing costumes, they tend to charge for it after. And for the Hollywood sign you should definitely go to Lake Hollywood Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcomayer1
50,Vacation,We drove up and down and all around it was way too hot to hike up and down the mountain to go see the Hollywood sign. The police man told us to go to this spot and we were delighted it was a great stop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paws0810
40,Great view,Great view of the sign. Narrow roads and not much parking. Definitely worth doing if you have your own car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L8911OOnatalief
50,Great place to see the Hollywood Sign,Always wanted to see the Hollywood Sign without being stuck on a bus or tour. Dove up the Lake Hollywood park and discovered we could get a great view of the sign take pictures as long as we wanted and grandkids could play on playground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmS7904FZ
50,Easy way to see Hollywood sign,"While I was Doing research on hollywood hikes I realized that many of them required 2-3 hours round trip of hiking, given that I only had a day to explore LA, I was excited to hear that this park had a close up view of the sign. The park is easily driveable or can Ubered. If you want to get more up close, you can do a 10 minute hike and you will be more close to sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayeung74
40,Nice view of the Hollywood sign,Glad we found this park. It gave us a nice view of the Hollywood sign and it had a nice park for our three year old to play at too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim723
50,Vacation with teen child,"We stopped here after our flight for a no hassle Hollywood sign pic. It was great! The directions from my navigator were a bit sketchy but we made it. The road was very narrow with a lot of turns. The views of the lake, LA and the Hollywood Sign were all great! We didn’t want to do the hike to actually go up to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleshanksbrown
10,Has become overrun,"The background of this location being the best spot for HS viewing is that another location was shut down by the city transferring tourist activity here. As a result when you google you find Curbed saying the lake park is the best. The problem is that it is OVERRUN.There are kind of two locations where you can get a picture. One is safest as there is a dirt area on which to stand that is not on the street (assuming you can get parking down the street and walk up to it). The other spot people go for some reason is further up the street past that point to a non pedestrian area on the side of the cliff next to the street which is one lane in each direction. Both residents and tourists use this street and very often tourists are IN it thus blocking traffic and making it quite dangerous for drivers and tourists alike.There is limited parking in walking distance from these spots to take selfies and there is now parking enforcement due to numerous illegal activities (parking in red, driving the wrong way, slowing so much traffic cannot get by, etc.). So you have residents trying to get through and parking enforcement.Lastly there are no public facilities here. No bathrooms at all. Everything is closed off to tourist traffic at sundown and it is just very, very congested. If you can find another location to get your photo it will be much more enjoyable.From what I understand the tickets will be increasing as the amount of tourist activity increases as well. They have to make sure residents can get through so they are upping penalties",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TabathaKim
50,Quick and easy!!,Great place to stop for a hassle free visit to the Hollywood sign!!!! Parking is abundant....and view are spectacular!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew_Hillary
50,Best place to see Hollywood Sign,"During our two days in LA, we were eagerly waiting for a photo op with Hollywood sign. Tried the Dolby theatre, Griffith Observatory and some other places, then read about this place on internet and took Uber from Hollywood in less than USD 10 and went to the park. This seems to be one of the best place to take photos with the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NQ8286
50,Best View!,"A lovely dog-friendly park with the best view of the Hollywood sign. Lots of trees to shade under if you wished but it's lovely to sit and watch all the dogs playing freely. The views of the Hollywood sign are fabulous and as a tourist, you can drive (or Uber) right to the top of the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CairaO
50,The view the world knows best,Without a doubt the crowd comes to see the famous Hollywood sign. Best viewed from the road leading up to the sign from the base of the walk at Lake Hollywood Park. The hike to the top of the sign is about 1.5 hours (lesser for fit people). Stay on the watch for snakes as they are out there (we saw 2). Park your car at the base of the park and make your way around the streets stopping now and then along the way to get those instagram photos. The best place for sure is about a third of the way up just past the gates.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie_2012
50,Best View,"This is the best place to see the Hollywood sign. You are so close. The roads are windy, but you can take a small hike and get even better views and pics.

50,Panoramic beauty. Great place to view the Hollywood sign!,Real trip! Great view of the famous Hollywood sign from this park and you can get some great shots. The rest is pretty banal. You can sit on the grass and enjoy a picnic.Take sandwiches and pop and a sheet or cane sheet and enjoy! There is a sign that says 'danger rattlesnakes' though it doesn't seem to faze anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lachmanbalani
50,Great Place to See the Hollywood Sign!!!,"While visiting Hollywood we wanted to see the famous Hollywood sign and found this park to have excellent views of the sign. The park itself is sort of hidden and is mostly just a big field, but the main attraction is the famous sign nearby. My family was able to have a lot of good pictures taken which is what we ultimately wanted. If you are in Hollywood and want to get a good close view of the sign this is definitely a place to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge
30,Just went for a quick pic,"If you have too see the sign just take a drive up the hill, parking is free as is the park. Not much else there. took some cool pictures. We did not have time or energy for the hike or bike tour but it is steep. Drive away from sign before making an illegal U-Turn it will cost you $90+.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StatenIslandGuy50

50,My rocker friend once hung from the Y....I can see Y now..those VIEWS!,"The drive up is beautiful.. The houses in the neighborhood alone is fun to look at. Once you get to the park , the parking is very packed and narrow. Practice your parallel parking for sure on a hill! Bring a picnic and sit in the park and enjoy. I didn't see an restroom...so go before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223pammyb
40,Worth the hike!,"We did the hike up to the Hollywood sign, which is an icon in itself. The bonus was the wonderful views! You need to be reasonably fit, but well worth the hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunwestcott
40,Excellent view of the Hollywood sign,"This park, although only has street parking, has a great view of the Hollywood sign, and I definitely recommend this park over the Griffith Observatory. There are actually two places right here with great views of the sign, one in the park and one less than 3 min walking distance. Because the weather was hot, we did not walk up to the Mt. Lee hiking trail, but we still had a wonderful time taking lots of fantastic pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wz4wwky
50,A must see and the best place to see the sign,This is a must see when going to Hollywood. There is a good amount of parking along a pretty steep hill. They have a playground for the kids and a nice grass area where your dog can run around and you can sit. And of course a nice close of view of the Hollywood sign. You can also walk around the trail to get closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lusion1
50,Great park to take pic of Hollywood sign,"Went there to take our iconic picture of the Hollywood sign. However, the park looks great as well and there seem to be great places to hike or walk. Would visit again if ever in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripeo
50,For the Picture,"I agree with others who said this is the best spot for pictures. Getting there is an adventure in itself if go through the tight roads on the hills. Then, parking is another adventure but be patient and smart and you'll be fine. Park up top if you find a spot - great angles for photos and you can just walk down to the grassy park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrisFM7
40,The Go-to Place for Hollywood sign photo,"This is really a small lush green garden that just so happens to have a great view of the Hollywood sign.

40,Good shots of Hollywood sign,"As a tourist to LA I would recommend this to be on your list. We didn’t find the area too busy and there are some good viewing shots for the Hollywood sign. It is in a quiet residential area and it can be nice to walk around to look at the local houses. Easily reached via taxi, we did have trouble getting a return taxi so it might be worth asking the taxi to pick you up again in an hour (for example) for those who haven’t got their own transport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmlreviews
10,Tourists be aware of a few things,"Lake Hollywood Park is located in a RESIDENTIAL neighborhood and the residents are becoming very upset with the city of Los Angeles for not protecting them and the visitors. There is no smoking in this very dry, high fire risk area. There are no bathrooms. That doesn't mean you can just urinate on someones private property. Plan accordingly. Private property is just that. Private. You can't take pictures whilst standing in someones flower bed to get a better view. You can't block driveways or just stop your car in a red zone for a better selfie. It's rude, dangerous and illegal. The parking is extremely limited. Take public transportation to Griffith Park and hike in. Your experience will be better. There are no ""legal tours"" of this area. If you are paying money to a private company for a tour, you are getting ripped off. It's a public park and it is free. Just be respectful of the rules and the neighborhood. Parking enforcement is on it so highly suggest you don't drive in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccobbBoston
50,Nice big area,This place is very scenic with ample parking along the street. It seemed like a dog park it was a great place to take pictures with the sign high above you. It's a steep walk to the park from the street but it's not far. Tricky to get to if you've never been here follow the sign to parking and you'll see everyone heading to the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redan08

50,Best view of Hollywood sign,I read lots of reviews as to where was best to get a picture with the Hollywood sign and very happy we decided on Lake Hollywood Park!

We also got an Uber therefore had no issues with parking etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurenfon
40,Great day out but no parking and no food/water,"We took a while to find a park and ended up parking outside in the street. Trekked up to the 'BatCave' and then some of the way up to the sign. Disappointed that there was no food/water available in or near the park - if there had been, we could have trekked for longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447harrietw
50,Perfect spot for Hollywood sign photo,"This is just the perfect spot for a picture of the Hollywood sign. Might need to drive a little bit around to find a parking spot, but people are leaving all the time as well, so we found a spot just after a few minutes for both our cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterTNorway

50,Nice little park,"Lake Hollywood park is a nice little park, complete with some close views of the famed ""Hollywood Sign"". The area surrounding the park also has good views of the nearby Reservoir.The park itself is a nice open space, with some rolling hills. It is at the foot of the hill/mountain with the ""Sign"". It is possible to walk up the road to get a better view of ""the sign"", but be advised that there isn't a clear sidewalk, and some areas where it's a narrow dirt path.All in all, not a bad little respite from the surrounding Urban Chaos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matts23

50,Great spot to get Hollywood Sign photo,"Awesome location to get a great pic of Hollywood sign in the background. Very clean park too. Lots of photo opportunities. Can be accessed by car only. Be prepared to have no mobile signal and no internet access at this park. The location is an uphill drive, and lots of parking across the street is available. This park definitely gives a more closer look at the Hollywood sign, and it’s about 15-20min drive from Union Station to here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avinashj340

40,Great jogging/walking trail.,"Most tourists aren't aware of ""Lake Hollywood Park"" given that it's ""hidden"" in the hills off of Barham Boulevard. Locals ""in the know"" use the park for jogging or power walking around Lake Hollywood. Great scenery for exercising or quiet time in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford

50,Place for the Hollywood Sign,"When I google mapped hollywood sign, it told me and my buddy to go through griffith park which was definitely not ideal. Going through Lake Hollywood Park is definitely the place to get a good shot of the sign. Very easy to drive to, street parking is available if you show up relatively early and it's only around a 1 mile walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yufliu505
50,Must see place in LA,Great place to see when in LA. A lot of walking up the hills but it's worth the view and the experience. Parking around is free.

I would visit again in I am there as is a great spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dori1305
40,Nice small park,"We found the park while driving around for a spot to view the Hollywood sign. It is a nice place for children to play, to take a stroll and to take photos of the iconic sign. It is not a dog park and your pets must be on a leash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyW619

On the other side of the road are great views of the city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHannah172
40,Small Park but Iconic Views,This place can get crowded parking-wise. The actual park is pretty small. I parked on a side street after you go down the steep hill and pass the park. There are swings etc for kids and the open field is great for dogs. But really what everyone comes here for is the View. And by The View I mean the Hollywood sign. You can get some great photos of it right there in the park but it's better if you hike up the hill and continue on through the residential area. It leads you to some much closer spots and the hike continues. Bring water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms

40,Closest you can get to the Hollywood sign without an hike,"First- a couple words of caution- if you come up thru the Hollywood hills, you’ll likely be in front of an angry local tail gating you. Pull over and let them thru if you are able. Be prepared for a very curvy road that is very narrow in sections. Second, once you get to the park area - park in the designated parking area. Parking patrol actively tickets those parked illegally and we saw them handing out tickets left and right. This is basically a dog park with the best view of the sign. That’s all you are going to do here- drive, park, snap a bunch of pictures, get in your car, drive away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinkykitty
50,Best view of the Hollywood Sign,"You have to drive through the winding residential roads, but it's truly the best view of the Hollywood sign. Just park on the side of the road and walk a little further to get great pictures of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paiten505
40,Great Views of the Hollywood Sign,"We drove up into the Hollywood Hills to get to this park. It had really nice views of the Hollywood sign. We never actually saw the lake, though we didn’t go on any of the hiking trails. There were signs warning hikers about rattlesnakes and mountain lions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericw824
50,Great place if your a local,"I think this is the ""dog park"" right below the Hollywood Sign.But if you go deeper into the neighborhood and park around Hollywood Lake, its 3 miles all the around. A great place to run or walk around the reservoir... You forget your in the middle of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8922SSlisat
40,Great Photo Op for the Hollywood Sign,"This is a nice park with an area that has a great view of the Hollywood Sign.

50,Great Spot,Good spot to see the sign! Parking can get pretty crazy but one of the few places in LA that you can stop at for free. After taking in the sights from Lake Hollywood Park we took a walk (prob about 25/30 mins) up to the intersection between Deronda Drive & Mulholland. Here you get closer to the Sign and it’s much quieter. Definitely worth doing if you’re fit enough. This is where the attached image was taken from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamie344

50,Absolutely majestic sites!,"We came here for the same reason most likely every one comes here for. The ability to grab what could easily be the best photographic moment with the illustrious Hollywood sign. While we didn't have much time to stick around.

40,Great place to see Hollywood sign!,It's a little bit of a drive through a residential area and winding roads but it is a perfect place to see the hollywood sign. Don't go too early in the morning though because it will be foggy and you won't see the sign! There is only parking on the side of the road but no issues getting a spot. Nice little playground and dog park but no restrooms. Not even port-a potties.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheljowo

50,Beautiful,Lake Hollywood Park is gorgeous. You have to hike a long way to get to the top of the hills or you can walk a little ways to get a good picture of the sign.

40,Crazy charm to Stand and take selfies with Hollywood sign Hill,We have visited many places on a day tour but few from inside and rest of them from outside. Visiting the Los Angeles and seeing sky line and museums and universities was a good experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neelu257

30,"Iconic View, best seen from further away..",We drove around the area but to be honest you cannot get right up to the sign so best to just view from afar.. it is iconic and a must do for the photo...The actual area is good to drive around and you get to see some of the big houses along the way,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
30,Lovely view,"It was a great sight to see and enjoy. Sadly parking is lacking and the parking enforcement don’t fool around. But if you are able to snag a picture, it is worth doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelburr77
30,A Cool View but It's Quick,Another iconic view that everyone recognizes and is fun to see in person - for a quick selfie. A bit overrated as you pull off road and see it as quickly as you can before you jump back into the car. It is fun to see but an average experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlsEatsExplrs

40,Just be patient,"The park has a gorgeous view for the HOLLYWOOD sign. You just need to be patient for the parking spot. People come, take pictures and then leave. It only took us ten minutes to mind our business here and when we walked back to our car both the cars in front and in the back of ours have changed.Plan to stay for only fifteen minutes but you may need extra time to wait for a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHUANG69

40,Best view of the sigh,Set in the hills this is the best place to see the sign. We went in a tour from out side the Chinese theatre which was 31 dollars each but this was a good one half hours and was nice being shown all the stars homes including J. K. Rowling. Also the driver took pictures of us which was a nice touch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spice2uk

Recommend go in the morning when it will be cooler temperatures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidforrest2018
50,Great View of Hollywood Sign,"This place is parallel parking, just be advised but it was free. To get here takes a little bit not a direct shot but it was so much fun actually driving too and from this place seeing the local area and life.

You can go to park too if you wish small playground and soccer fields.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breanne07

30,"Cute Park, but basically a place to see the Hollywood sign","Its a cute little kids park on a hill, with the closest view that you can get of the Hollywood sign. Playground area and park areas to relax. It wont take you more than an hour here - probably less. Not too much else to say, except that its quite a winding route through the hills to find it. Best to do this on your way to see something else nearby (Universal, etc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmorris2112
50,"Great place to see ""the sign""","Okay, finding somewhere to take a picture of the famous Hollywood sign can be frustrating (to say the least). This park is the perfect place to solve all your problems! It's easy to find, there's plenty of parking, and everyone seems pretty nice! We didn't walk too far up towards it, but it was a great place to grab some of those iconic pics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
50,"Great park, great views and the iconic sign!","There are few signs as recognizable as this one. After decades of thinking about seeing it I finally went. While I did not go behind the sign I did get a great view and pictures from Lake Hollywood Park. The park is located below the sign and perched high above Los Angeles. In addition, there is a great view of Lake Hollywood and the surrounding area. The park is accessed by Canyon Lake Drive which is a steep and winding road requiring a bit of skill. Street parking is all that is available so remember your hill parking rules. Fun and definitely worth doing while in LA. The park is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CATTSAR

Great selfie opportunities of the Los Angeles nature at it's best.Not to miss this secret locals hangout spot where not too many tourist go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheenaGao
40,Perfect spot to view the Hollywood sign!,"Had family in town that wanted to get as close to the Hollywood sign without having to hike up a trail. Showed them the view from Hollywood and Highland and Griffith Park, but it wasn't close enough. We decided to go to Lake Hollywood Park and we were not disappointed.Getting to the park takes you through some meandering neighborhood streets that are so narrow, two cars can't pass each other. Once there, limited street parking on a steep incline is all that is available.The view to the north is of Mt. Lee and the Hollywood sign. If you take a look to the south, you'll get a glimpse of the Hollywood Reservoir and Hollywood in the distance. The view at sunset was pretty stunning.Overall, if your goal is to get a close look at the Hollywood sign without much effort, it is a great location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burculian
50,Beautiful Day,"Whilst in LA we visited the park at Lake Hollywood, situated between the lake (Hollywood dam) and the iconic sign giving great views of both.The park offers a large grassed area for ball games or picnics, walking /hiking tracks and the playground hs recently been refurbished with cool playground equipment.There are signs warning of rattles snakes and we were also warned of coyotes in the area in the evenings.

50,PERFECT PLACE TO SEE THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN AND PHOTO,"Came here for a photo of the Hollywood Sign as i was at the Griffith Observatory the day before and was a bit disappointed in not getting a good photo with the sign. Yes you could see the sign but was very far a way. Unless you had a state of the art camera you could not really have a good photo.Anyway after 2 buses from Sunset Plaza and a 1.4 mile walk i got there. Was well worth the effort and glad i did.The walk was really nice as you saw some nice houses and the people who lived there were really nice and said hello. You saw some great views also as you walked up some steep slopes.This park is small and was not overly crowded. There were many people with dogs and also there is a childrens playground .One thing missing were toilets.This is a great location for your photo with the Hollywood Sign and even if you don,t have a car you can still get there for your perfect picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddier576
50,Put yourself in a Hollywood Sign selfie!,"The park is below the Hollywood Sign, so you can snap pics of the the sign, selfies and even get a look at Lake Hollywood south of the park.

30,Good place for a selfie with the Hollywood sign,"Ample parking along the street. Plenty of space to get some pictures or selfies with the sign. Not too tough to find. Not normally crowded.

But it's convenient to get a picture if you don't have lots of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettlarkins
50,Park with a great view,If you want a view of the Hollywood Sign this is the place to go. It was so peaceful even though the park is full of dogs they are all having fun chasing tennis balls. I'm not a dog person but every now and then one would come over for a fuss but it was all good fun. If you get chance have a walk about 10-15 mins around the corner up the hill and get great pics of the sign. Great place if you just want to laze around in the sun out of all the hustle and bustle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
30,not for kids,"In the event that you like that kind of thing, this is the recreation center for you. Not a place for kids. The off-chain rules, stopping are totally unenforced and it's flooding with smoking vacationers. As of now had a fire and child's chomped there. Inhabitants stay away from it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnMpozos

40,Perfect spot for the perfect shot of the Hollywood sign,I was originally headed to the Griffith Observatory for pictures of the Hollywood sing. Traffic there was horrible so I headed towards Lake Hollywood Park after seeing recommendation on TripAdvisor. I'm glad for that decision as I got great shots of the sign. Not too many people around and the view was great! Parking along the side of the road was not too bad. The only thing missing was a restroom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Relianess

50,Perfect Spot,"This is the perfect spot if you want a pic or selfie with the Hollywood Sign, no false traffic signs or detours here, just google Lake Hollywood Park, you can park outside and walk towards the sign until you get the perfect spot. Don't bother driving any further along the road, you won't get parked",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liampc67
40,Excellent views of the sign. Good parking,"Did a side tour to see the Hollywood sign. Had read that Griffith Observatory was an excellent spot to see the sign and find parking. Unfortunately, the evening we headed up to the observatory there was an event. Traffic was terrible, bumper to bumper and they had signs up saying the lot was full. My wife saved the day with a Google search and found this place. From where we were, we had to go up some pretty steep and windy roads. We arrived just after 7pm. There was parking on the side of the road and not too far down the hill. It's a short but steep walk up the hill for the good photo shots but very easy to get an unobstructed photo of the sign and your family without others in the shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptownsendj
40,Great Little Park,"We wanted to see the Hollywood sign and tried to go to Griffith Park Observatory but they were having an event and traffic/parking was a nightmare. We opted for this and it was awesome. Families, dogs, and picnics galore! If you want to have the experience but not the congestion, this is the place for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifercZ1027BT
50,Best view of the Hollywood Sign,"This is by far the best place to get a view and a good selfie with the Hollywood sign. It is a bit of a strain on the transmission driving up to the park but well worth it. It's best to get there early because a lot of the parking on the street is taken by 11:00. Parking was a bit of an issue because keep in mind this park is in a residential area. Also, if you keep driving past the park up into more of the residential area, there will be a guard/police to turn you around. Be careful where you park because you will be ticketed or even worse, towed. It is hot and the sun is beaming so once again, I can't stress enough the importance of early arrival during the summer months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cenalestravel

50,Hollywood Reservoir - a Spectacular piece of paradise,"Known also as Lake Hollywood, just 2 miles drive from the ""walk of fame"" up the narrow streets into the Santa Monica mountains lies this wonderful, peaceful sanctuary. Soak in the stunning views over the lake or to the city, and breath in the fresh clean air, and look at the turtles swimming. The famous ""Hollywood"" sign is also so close.We loved walking the length of the resovoir, as it is just so lovely and peaceful. The Hollywood Reservoir should be near the top of the to-do list for anyone visiting Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevea617

40,Gorgeous Views of LA and Hollywood Sign--But park is really for the dogs! LOL,"The first stop (based on recommendations) of my day with a rental car during my April 2017 Weho visit. Winding roads climb to the top of this site (be sure you know how to park and backup on a steep hill). As many have mentioned the views of LA and the famed Hollywood sign are excellent. The 'park,' however, is really a large open space--it is perfect if you're traveling with your four-legged pal. Otherwise, the sidewalks offer a semi-challenging hike up the road. Worth the views and a test of your mountain driving skills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williambJ8243XH

50,Best Place to get pictures of the Hollywood sign,"Free street parking here. Nice little, clean park to hang out. Walk up the pathway for the best views to get pictures of the Hollywood sign. You can keep walking to make your way up the sign. There are a lot of signs that say no access/ trespassing, but we walked over to an officer, who was in his car, as we walked through the neighborhood who told us we were okay and heading the right direction- he even gave us a map. So don't let the signs discourage your hike, if the officer was willing to help us and say we were okay, then it must not be an issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaCLC
40,Perfect for the photos!,"This park just below the Hollywood sign, not only turns out to be the best place to take a picture with the inscription as a background, but also an oasis of tranquility just a few kilometers from the chaos of this great metropolis.

40,Off the beaten path by the Hollywood Sign,"We followed the advice of another reviewer and took a walk. We parked near the little park, took photos of the sign (of course!) and took a path from just above the park that went off to the right, past the white wall of a large mansion. The walk winds gently down to the lake, through some nice wild scenery. We passed dog walkers, but it was pretty peaceful there. At the lake, we walked on the dam bridge and looked down over LA and at the water, then we took the path back to the car. We could have walked around the lake, but that would have added an hour or so to our walk, so we simply retraced our steps. It was a great way to see the famous sign and get some exercise and see a bit of secret LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbea67
50,Peaceful 3 mile hike,"Use google maps to access from 5 or 101. 5-10 minutes from either, beautiful local houses on the way up, tight roads, parking at the park entrances. About 3 miles around the lake, low traffic, very peaceful and quiet walk or run.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan

50,Great place for pic of Hollywood sign,"This is a small park up in the hills. The park itself is flat and provides a great view of the Hollywood sign. If you are looking for a better pic, walk up the road that goes above the park - there are a few places that are even better to take a pic - but no parking up there!The problem is the parking - you can only park on the street and there is no place to turn around. If you are close and see a parking space, grab it.Note the sign near the kids playground - beware of rattlesnakes. Not a problem in the grassy park area.I also crossed the street to see if there was a view of LA. There is NOT a view from the park entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norwegianblue_1
50,nice spor to see hollywood sign,ther are many spots you can take picture of hollywood sign. This one is quite good when compared to others. I think this is where we spent time most .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191semiha
40,Excellent picnic and photo stop,"I take all my friends and family members who visit from out of town to this park. Best view of the Hollywood sign, plus a great place for a nice picnic and drive through the hills. On weekends--especially in the summer--parking can be a challenge, but otherwise you can usually find a space or if you're willing to walk a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,Best Place,"We really thought this was the best place to see the Hollywood sign. Great Pics. There is a sign on one of the side streets that says ""no access"" to Hollywood sign, but just ignore it.....I think that's how they cut down on traffic through the neighborhood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamFive1
40,Great Hollywood Sign and LA Views,"Super cool drive to this park through small and winding streets. Arriving, you'll get some good views on the Hollywood sign and LA. Don't expect any more of this place than just that, but it has to be part of your LA-experience ;-P",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AVDM81
30,Best photo op,This has to be the best photo opportunity for the Hollywood sign. The streets may give your passengers motion sickness as they twist and turn all the way up and all the way down. There is a good deal of parking as it seems not many people know of or don't want to venture that far off the beaten path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzo10943
50,The perfect 1.5 hours in Los Angeles!,"I am an Angeleno and routinely walk around the Lake Hollywood reservoir. I believe this is one of the hidden gems of LA! It's just over 3 miles around, and you enjoy the views of the Hollywood Sign and hills, downtown Hollywood and beyond, a gorgeous reservoir/lake, and wildlife. The dam was commissioned by William Mulhulland, a water pioneer in LA's history (and water thief to some!). I've seen deer, coyote, and don't forget to look over the dam wall for turtles and birds. While you can access from the Hollywood or Valley side, the Valley side is a bit simpler and has much more parking. it takes me about one hour to walk it. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondesteven
40,Lots of tourists,"It must be rather difficult to live up here. First, the roads are very steep and winding. Second, there are tourists and photo takers around all day. It has a great view of both the Hollywood sign and downtown LA skyline (and smog). When we visited it was too hot for any dogs to be playing in the dog park or for any kids to be playing on the playground. There was a traffic cop there ready to give tickets to those parked facing the wrong way on the hill. People need to be safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
50,Nice place for jogging,"I followed some internet hints that said that was a nice place for jogging. It was indeed. Nice reservoir and a fancy neighborhood. Very quiet and flat place to run. No toilets, no shops, no food. Go, run or walk and leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelloNitz
40,Mandatory photo place,This is one of the better places for a picture of the Hollywood Sign. The park isn't spectacular or anything. Small park in a residential neighborhood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakshubkn
50,Best area for Hollywood Sign Picture,The drive to this park is a nice drive as you go into the Hollywood Hills. You pass beautiful mansions and eventually come to the park area. Parking is easy and wasn't crowded when we went. The park is well maintained and there are good overlook areas for the perfect Hollywood Sign Photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acejosh11
50,Hollywood sigh,It's a really nice park and if You have dog it must be one of the coolest places on earth to walk Your dog out. The sign it self is just looking down wards to the park. On my opinion it's the best place to see the Hollywood sigh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T11N
50,Go here for your Hollywood sign photo!,"This is the perfect spot for that classic must-have tourist photo! There's a cute little park with lots of pups running around, but if you continue up the road just a bit, you get a vantage point above the park with just the right view. It wasn't too crowded when we went in the morning. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392heathers
40,Nice place...hard to get to,"It's a very nice picnic park, with the famous Hollywood sign behind it, nice pic opportunity but if there is any road work, be prepared to take lengthy detours...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amrodr0
30,It's all in the letters?,"There are lots of parks like this; nothing makes it special, besides the big letters on HOLLYWOOD hill. In fact, in the letters, there is nothing special, just letters that are often on TV. Many believe it's a good idea to be photographed on their background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardbT2103JE
30,Small scenic park,"Located in the hills overlooking Los Angeles the Lake Hollywood Park offers a nice place to spend some time in the ""country side"" while still in the city. Scenic and calm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Great Place to Relax and Take Pictures of Hollywood Sign,This is a great place to take the pictures of the hollywood sign.Also the park is quite spacious to play some games for kids and has quite a few picnic benches for having snacks and food.The drive is also great as you pass through the curvy roads of the City.Sometime the parking might be difficult to find. But can be managed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/345kirann
50,Best spot to see the sign,"The Hollywood Lake Park itself is kind of small. Great place to see the Hollywood sign though. If you drive up another 100 yards, there is a nice flat spot for pictures and a great view of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rizznizz
10,There's really nothing there!,"Lots of people drawn to this area by the Hollywood sign. No bathrooms, no infrastructure...just a long drive for a photo. Bleh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE

I booked uber to reach the park but getting back to my hotel i struggled. A kind man dropped me to nearest location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karthikdevaraja
50,Hollywood Sign,A great place to see the Hollywood SIgn! Its Amazing!! The park is so pretty and relaxing i could have stayed there for hours. Great drive thru the neighborhood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayzee13
50,Best spot to see the Hollywood Sign,"For me, this is the best spot to see the Hollywood sign. It's easy to park in front of the park, and take pictures and if you go up around it, towards the sign, there are spots where you can take really good pictures that if you angle your camera, it appears you are right in front of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank
50,Yep! A Do Not Miss...,"Add on to your tour of the Hollywood Hills with that private cab tour!!!Must do & be sure to order a picnic lunch box for the whole day's journey :-). If you're on a quick trip, the pre-packed lunch saves so much time; eat in the car or take outside for the views. Don't waste time going to a restaurant....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6
50,"BEST VIEW of the ""Hollywood"" sign!","If what you want is a GREAT picture of you and the Hollywood sign this place is your best bet. I searched all over for a place where the letters would be clear to read in the photo, this was by far the best place I found! Its only a 20 minute car ride from Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinck11
50,A must see if in California,It's a PITA to get too with a lot of winding roads but once you get there and find a parking spot it's worth the trip. Get awesome pictures and bragging rights that you saw the famous hollywood sign. It's only a sign but a landmark. Go there. Get there. Take pictures and say you saw it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joee5
40,Best spot to see the sign!,I could not care less about the sign really. But it is amazing how you get caught in the moment of wanting to get the best photo of the sign.The best photo of the sign is here. The place has no other known attraction!Park carefully. There is lots of enforcement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KK_M_11
30,Nice spot to see Hollywood Sign but disappointing park,This is probably one of the best spot to see the Hollywood sign. However the walk around the lake/reservoir (1hour20) isn't that nice given that you walk all the way around fence (left and right); thus you cannot fully enjoy the nature as you feel in prison.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/485md
40,Great place for pictures with Hollywood sign,In order to get to lake Hollywood park you have to drive up a very narrow and winding road. We went on a Friday morning around 11 am and there were only a handful of people. You will need to park your car on a steep hill. This park allows dogs so be careful of dog poop. If you keep driving up the hill you will be able to see the lake and also get some pictures of the Hollywood sign. We only stayed for about half hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101garyn
20,"Awful crowds, no parking angry residents","Avoid this location because the neighborhood is unfriendly and there is no parking. There are always Police and Rangers present, and traffic officers issue tickets for anything. Go to Mount Hollywood Drive, or Runyon Park for a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
10,"Dog poop, used condoms, cig. butts & traffic","If you like that sort of thing, this is the park for you. Not a place for kids. The off-leash rules, parking are completely unenforced and it's overflowing with smoking tourists. Already had a fire and kid's bitten there. Residents avoid it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RioAngelina
50,"Best Place For Sign Pictures, Low Key","By far the best place to see and take pictures of the Hollywood sign, Its a nice drive up to the park, and the park itself is well maintained, and a great place to bring your pets. Traffic wasn't an issue for me, even on the weekend, there was still plenty of parking on the side of the road by the park. There weren't too many people around and we got many nice clear pictures of the sign. Bring 100mm zoom lens and it'll look like your literally in front of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictorA549
50,Best spot to see the sign,"I have been to Hollywood multiple times and never got close to the sign. Based on reviews I choose the park and it was well worth drive. Amazing park with lots of green space all within view of the sign. Across the street from the park, overs awesome views of Lake Hollywood and Hollywood in the distance (see photos). If your like hiking, the hills are great for for a nice hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustingDuo
50,Lake Hollywood Walk - 3 miles of pure LA bliss!,"Taking the walk around the beautiful and incredibly well located Lake Hollywood reservoir is one of my favorite things to do in LA. It can be reached by the Hollywood side (winding streets and smallish parking area), as well as the San Fernando Valley side (winding streets, loads of parking), and takes you on a flat walk around two lakes (reservoirs), beautiful landscaping and chaparral, views of the Hollywood sign as well as views to Hollywood and beyond. Be sure to stop and take in the views from the main reservoir support, which was built in the heyday of LA water...the 1920s. It's free, beautiful, very ""LA"", and a must see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondesteven
40,"Best place for view of the sign, and for a quiet walk","If you want the best view of the sign for pics, etc, this is the spot. Also, the loop around Lake Hollywood is so nice and peaceful in the evenings before sunset. The huge pine trees and the wildlife make it feel less desert like and more lush. Hidden gem of a location. The homes up the hill have really interesting architecture, for those just wanting to drive around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
50,Excellent if you want to see the sign,"If you are like us and want to sign the Hollywood sign without hiking up a mountain, then this is the place to go, we went to look out points A & B and both were closed, so went here instead. Long steep hi on the way up but well worth it & looking in the other direction, great views over LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bran94
50,Hollywood Sign from two angles,"Hiking up to see the Hollywood sign turned out to be even better than I anticipated. The hills are pretty steep and the whole hike is pretty much a continuous ascend with very few flat areas. The are no signs to indicate the right way but if you keep going in the direction of the sign you won't miss it. Also there are plenty other hikers if you need a word of reassurance.To get there, come to address 2700 Canyon Drive, Hollywood and drive through the gates into a small park, drive down as much as you can before the road closes, leave the car and head in the direction of the continuation of the road. There are not too many places to turn so just keep going on the trail. Once you get to a fork on a paved road you have two options1.Left will lead you to the front view of the sign, although not too close it is a very nice view2.Right will lead you much closer but from the back of the signBut hey, why choose? Do both!One word of caution: If you start out at the park located at the Bronson Canyon entrance (which has a free parking and a few little things for the kids) keep in mind that the park closes at dusk. So if you leave your car there it is a good idea to leave yourself enough time to come back on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katzmopolitan
50,Very close up view of the sign,"Especially driving up to the sign, you get extremely close to the sign, pretty much right up in your face close. The park wasn't all that crowded, so it wasn't like you were waiting behind a big crowd of people to see the sign. I saw some people with their dogs or just spending time in the park. My fiance and I just took pictures and left, but do keep the park in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ian_and_Ivy
40,"Great view of sign, lake",We drove up to see the sign and happened upon a great view of the Lake as well. This was a short drive from our hotel at Universal/City Walk. Neat views of the city too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharalDc
