40,Great Friday Evening Meal,"Went here last Friday night with friends. We started off with the Scotch Eggs. I really love true Scotch Eggs, and while these were different they were also very good. I have never had sauce on the side, and it was tasty. My Bouzy Burger was very good and the hamburger meat really delicious, not even comparable to most burgers based on quality. We also had the chili cheese fries which were excellent. Paired with a couple of nice pints of IPA a very good meal. My wife had the fish and chips and enjoyed that as well.",JJLMc
40,"For great happy hour grazing excellent cocktails, and cozy environment","Happy hour gathers folks from all over. The small plates, appetizers, salads, sandwiches and burgers reward them all. Fried chicken salad, Philly cheesesteak, fried pickles, and Bouzy Gastropub signature burger are excellent.",Bill A
40,Great Eats and Happy Hour,"Long time South Bay chefs Michael Franks and Robert Bell created a front room gastropub with a large bar, good eats and a generous happy hour in their iconic Chez Melange restaurant.",ronsK8337AE
50,"Neighborhood ""Cheers"" bar with great food",We really enjoyed this friendly place with super helpful staff. The food was way beyond expectation for bar food so don't let the Bouzy name fool you. The bar was well stocked and the bar tender was top notch. We were made to feel at home here and even the regular customers were welcoming of tourists. This was a totally different experience from the regular L. A. ambience and a welcome change for us. No Bar Rescue lessons needed here!,Hannahbarbra
50,Awesome pub in Riviera Village with great menu & live music many nights!,"Between Bouzy's Gastropub and Chez Melange (2 restaurants in 1 spot) there's lots of choices between incredible food, drinks and entertainment! There's also a small ""date night"" seafood bar in the back called ""Bar 150"" where you can get oysters, shrimp prepared right in front of you! Many nights they have live music as well as most Sunday's for brunch. Bouzy's has an awesome front patio area as well with heaters so you can keep warm on chilly nights! Ohhh...my favorite menu item is their famous Pancho Burger with an extra side of Franks sauce! For sure check out each venue and enjoy :)",Jeff Ginsburg
40,Cheeseburgers,"This is a great standby. The service is always excellent, and the drinks are great. We enjoyed coming for the five dollar cheeseburgers on Monday night. They are nothing special, but always hit the spot. Truffle fries were very good as well.",Kaymtravel7
50,Wonderful menu & great wine by the glass!,"Fabulous place for lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed here. Michael Franks, the owner, has been at it for decades and always makes you feel right at home. The food is ALWAYS spectacular and the wine list is wonderful and accessible. Wines by the glass are great. Try the fried chicken salad - there is nothing else like it!",Phil W
50,Never disappoints! Great food & drinks. Local favorite.,"Whenever out of town guests ask where to go out to eat when visiting it can be hard to come up with a good list of spots that I can feel confident in recommending. Living in an area can make you biased about spots that hold a special memory, or that you've been able to try more than once. When I think about a place that has consistently impressed me time and time again, it's Bouzy Gastropub (Bouzys to us locals).From a bouzy brunch with bottomless mimosas (until 2 pm usually), to a date night dinner, the delicious food has always left me excited to come back again. On my most recent visit I had the Fried Chicken Salad & it was ah-mazing. At $19 it is a little pricey for a salad, but they don't skimp on the fried chicken. The pecans add a great sweetness to compliment the savory chicken. I even commented on the salad later to my husband while we were having drinks at another bar down the street (check back for that review soon).Located at the north end of the Riviera Village area of Redondo Beach, Bouzy Gastropub can be a great spot to kick off a walking ""tour"" of the quaint small-town-style gathering of shops, eateries, & bars. Just a few blocks west is the sparkling Pacific Ocean. You can take a long walk north or south and work off the amazing meal while watching beach goers, dogs being walked, and hear the crashing waves.Things to Note:- Metered street parking can be an issue, but I believe that if you're eating at the restaurant there is parking in the underground garage next to the restaurant (it's sometimes valet).- Live music on Thursdays- Oyster bar daily- NO brunch on Saturdays :(- It's hard to see the entrance when driving; it's just past the sidewalk herb garden (used for some of the menu items) & bushes north of Sacks on The Beach.",honeybee3087
50,Mid week date night,"What a great night, even though it was in a middle of the week. This place have everything you want. If you are looking for a quite night the next door they have a quite ambiance. If you are looking for just oysters bar they have it. Or if you looking for a sports bar with a great entertainment they have it. What a genius idea! Anyway even though if you are in the sports bar section and you would like to eat sea food instead of comfort food you can order. It. Their food was very delicious & fresh. Their service was great. They had a great music & the singer (Charise) her voice was great.If you are looking for great food & entertainment don’t go anywhere else this is the place.",Nasrin M
50,Amazing and then some,"Man, this is really a great little spot! So much so, that we have been here several times, and plan to come even more often.What is there to say about a place that has good food, good drinks, good service and good ambiance all rolled into one.You can sit at tables or at the bar – either works well and the service is equally good. I last ordered some really great beer (of which they have a good selection) while my wife had a really dirty martini.I’ve had their Smoked Salmon, the Duck Breast Quesadilla, the Pan roasted White Sea Bass, the Lamb Osso Buco and more, and it has always been so freaking good, OMG. Frank, the owner, often comes around to ask how we are doing; the servers are all great. This is a gastropub worth the visit – on every level. Can’t wait to go again – and again – and again!",asharp77
50,Drinks and appetizers,"Loved this gastropub! They had the best Pate I've had in a very long time, the pork bites ( a deep fried pork belly nouget) we're divine and the service was excellent.",Amy T B
50,"Went Monday, which is apparently Burger night","Went with a friend, and discovered when we got there that it is burger night. They have a double deck burger for $5.Instead, we opted for the Pancho Burger and Southwest Chicken Salad.The ‘Knife & Fork’ Pancho Burger is an excellent 8oz Beef Patty, Bacon, Avocado, Chile Relleno, Franks Hot Sauce Vinaigrette. VERY tasty and thank goodness we split it, as it was huge. The Southwest Chicken salad was also very good.",Richard K
50,"Great food, great atmosphere","Been coming here for years, and they always have something new on the menu to try. I'm sometimes sad when one of my favorites disappears, but I guess shishito peppers were so over. Don't worry, the Pancho Burger will never disappear. Happy Hour is the best if you can get there in time. Fresh seafood cart, foodie stuff to try, nice servers without attitude but happy to help you decide, great pub atmosphere (reminds me of my local Chicago bars way back). Wish they had some more local beers! (Might I suggest The Strand Atticus, perhaps?) Every time I go I think, we should come here more often!",Hayes324
30,Hanging out with friends,After watching the UFC fights a few friends and I decided to go to get snacks and drinks. We chose Bouzy Gastropub and I am glad we did. The atmosphere was calm and easy. The staff are friendly and the prices are reasonable.,Latnldy1
40,Yes! Really liked this place.,"**If you liked this review or it was helpful - please vote it helpful below. Keep me excited about reviewing on Trip Advisor**Who knew about this place! It's hard to recognize it's a French Gastropub from the outside - not much signage.But I think the place was GREAT! Loved the food. I had the Duck something or other... LOVED it! All of the food was good. It's lively and cozy inside. Our waitress was awesome - I wish I remembered her name.Try this place out for a nice big, yummy dinner on a Saturday night.Enjoy.",Ocean F
50,Small but mighty,"Hidden, off site, stellar food at this small offshoot of infamous Chez Melange. Fabulous lunch menu, the finest ingredients. Have never been disappointed.",Monika M
