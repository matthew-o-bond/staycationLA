50,Dive Catalina with Tony and his team!,"As everyone knows, diving in Southern California is usually hard work, so it was wonderful to learn that our dive crew had the tanks and weights on the boat before we got there. Island Diver is not the perfect dive boat, but it was small and FAST! Just over One hour to Catalina! Dylan was the DM and he was the most professional,Kind, helpful, sweet, and fun DM in SoCal ever! I rented the BCD - excellent in new condition! This is a big YES!!!",Lisa M
50,Super Annual Sale,Seven seven has the best month long annual sale. It's an awesome sale 4 winter and spring items because it's always held in February. I love it. Their location has grown; there's plenty of parking and their customer service is awesome.,Laurie W
50,Great day diving off Catalina,"We booked a day through Dive N Surf on the Westerly dive boat, which took us to a couple of dive spots off Catalina. The boat left early from Long Beach, but were very flexible about my son and I coming the night before to stay over. The gear was top notch, all well-maintained and functioning. Smooth pick up (you go to the smaller building across the car park from the main store) and drop-off - the rental store even stayed open a little later to accommodate divers coming off the boat. The captain and crew were exceedingly friendly and knowledgable.The shop itself is extremely well-equipped. The founders of the store also founded Body Glove, so that's the main technical apparel brand on offer. There's a good selection of T shirts as well as pretty much everything a surfer or scuba diver could need.",Arthurascii
40,"Great place for scuba-diving information, equipment and lessons!","Dive 'N Surf is a must-see for tourists visiting Redondo Beach. They have great t-shirts, clothes and accessories to buy as souvenirs and for a day at the beach.And if you want to learn to dive in the South Bay, this is the place to go. Their instructors are well-trained, experienced and know the area well. You'll have a fun time learning to scuba dive in a safe environment.",FemaleTraveler902
50,Legendary forerunner to the dive and surf lifestyle,This is one of the earliest places that offered all the things needed. I believe they were the inventors and/or early adopters of the wetsuits that are what everyone uses today. The founders are true legends known worldwide.,LodgingExpert
50,Full service Dive Shop,Top shop for anything you need for diving or beach going. Top names in apparel and equipment. Very knowledgeable service from staff. prices in line with other dive shops.,Judpma012
50,Best dive/surf shop in the south bay,always friendly staff - great variety of items from clothes to dive equipment to boards. They have it all and have great sales throughout the year. this place has been here since before me and I have been here and shopping here for 40 years !!!It is the first place I stop when I need equipment for the ocean,Marcthornton1
20,What attitudes in this place,I hope we just got there at the wrong time today but the woman working the dive desk in the rear was rude. I had a few questions about some products and she just acted like I was a nuisance and would rather I wasnt there. I got the message and decided not to spend my $500-$600 there.Its a shame because they have such a nice new store after the facelift. Its just too bad the vibe is like an elitist cooler-than-you attitude in the air. Too bad ET Surf doesnt sell dive gear as their people are so down to earth with no pretention.,aimeeeeel
50,Fantastic dive training,"I decided to take the open water training on the spur of the moment while in RB visiting friends. The normal schedule spanned two weekends, but the instructor, Vaughn Allen, also offered the alternative of staying in Catalina overnight and completing the required dives on Monday. So, pool and dives in three days. Wonderful.The PADI e-learning class had to be completed in advance, of course. I chose the e-learning “touch” option for ipad. It has a few bugs, requiring a restart or two, but I liked it and I would use it again. Restarting did not make it lose my place. The advantage of the tablet app over the PC version is that a constant internet connection is not needed except while testing and the PADI Library has a number of useful apps. Android users have equivalent library apps - not sure about the training.The class started with a couple of hours of classroom lecture, and filling out all of the forms - for me, this was a Wednesday and semi-private - only two of us with the instructor, Vaughn Allen. Saturday we (seven of us) met in the pool to learn how to assemble and use the equipment, make sure we would survive a dip in the ocean, and swimming in circles. Sunday, we (six of us, plus instructor and divemaster) took the ferry to Catalina Island (from Long Beach) and dove amongst the kelp forests and schools of fish and sunken boats, and did our required exercises. Sunday, the two of us that stayed over completed the last of our required four dives for certification, and then swam around looking at the fish and ruined boats and what not for two additional dives (so, six for the weekend) thanks to the generosity of our instructor. Extra cost for the overnight was around $50 each for the instructor’s out-of-pocket expenses, plus our food and lodging.Vaughn Allen does his best to make learning to dive a fun experience even though you have to take your mask off under water without choking and so forth. He succeeds because he is a pretty nice, patient and very knowledgeable guy. He was good at identifying the why of my problems and giving a solution that works. I would recommend him highly just for that. He is fun to be around out of the water, too, with stories of diving and also his former life (I’ll let him tell you). He likes to dive, and he seemed happy that a couple of us wanted to stay over an extra day.I needed all of the required equipment and the staff in the dive store was helpful and knowledgeable. The equipment they have is of good quality; I checked Amazon for the same equipment and I paid less in the store for all but one item (the exception was $1.50 more). More importantly, the equipment all worked for me. One of my classmates decided she needed different fins when we were in the pool, and the staff brought her new ones (and took the old ones back). I was worried about my bootie size, which turned out to be correct, but it was nice to not have to worry about it. The pool, btw, is on site with all of the necessary dive equipment right there on racks, so one can pick and choose and change.The rental shop is across the street from the dive shop with its own parking, so pick-up and drop-off is a cinch (and the carry distance short.) All the dive equipment was included in the price of the class. Everything was ready when I got there, all wrapped in a bundle (except for the tank, of course). The rental staff were great: helpful and flexible.On the whole, a fantastic experience. I’ll be back for the advanced class and to use my two free rentals.",DanielOlson
50,My Local Dive Shop,"Have been visiting dive and surf for many years for swimsuits, but recent got into Scuba diving. I did my open water and advanced open water certification classes here with Gary, the instructor.The classes were well structured and the included day trip to Catalina was nice too. As for buying equipment, the annual ""yard sale"" is a great opportunity (usually in February) to get discounted equipment.I'll keep coming back for gear servicing, new equipment, and some rental gear as needed - plus my air fills.",Patrick F.
50,Knowledgable and friendly!!,My husband and I are going to start scuba diving we went here on a friends recommendation. They were great super friendly helped us get exactly what we needed. Loved them!,Nicole V
