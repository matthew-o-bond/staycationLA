50,"A laidback, fun brewery",Brewyard is awesome. They rotate through interesting beers. The space is open. The staff is friendly. Never a bad time.Just double-check your directions before you go - it's a little hidden underneath the Western Ave. bridge!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
50,"Fantastic beer, great vibe","My wife and I love the Brewyard. It features great beer in a very welcoming atmosphere. Check in advance on their website to see which food truck is there and you can't go wrong. It's a bit difficult to find on your first visit so be patient. It's ""under"" Western Avenue (actually about 200 feet away from the underpass!). Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,Something for everyone!,"Tucked away under the Western Ave. bridge in Glendale, Brewyard isn't the most inviting place but it does have its own little charm. They specialize in ""Common"" style Californian lagers which is actually perfect because that's all that I like to drink ðŸ˜œ They do also have a lot of other varieties, so there's definitely something for everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westlingk
50,An easy place to kick back with friends.,"A friend who lives nearby was dying to show us this place when we visited from out of state. It's hidden away under a bridge, and he had been living in the area for nearly a year before he knew it was there. The staff are very friendly. There were free ice pops in a self-serve cooler to help beat the heat. There were video games, and of course BEER, but we played darts against a wall so well decorated in chaotic art that any misguided throws would be well camouflaged. The guys loved the beer. As the designated driver, I loved the fact that it was a vibrant enough environment to stay engaged even while sober, while still being low-key enough to hear conversations easily. A true neighborhood gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisond46
50,Excellent beer & Atmosphere,Loved this place. Tucked back amongst some warehouses. The beer list was excellent with many great innovations. I started with the Randall which was their Impostor syndrome infused with grapefruit and mint. It was excellent. Neither the grapefruit nor the mint was over powering but added to the citrus of the hops. They don't serve food but there are usually food trucks. I highly recommend this hidden gem. One of the best breweries in LA for sure!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siri_in_Shanghai
40,"Great beer selection, chill vibe","I visited late on a Wednesday evening and was somewhat surprised to see it so crowded at 9:30 midweek. I found out much later that King Trivia does trivia night on Wed so that explained a lot. Other reviews mention that it can be difficult to find which I would agree if you're not familiar with Glendale and the train track overpass by the 5 fwy. I knew exactly where it was when I looked at the map but I'm a Glendale local so take it for what it's worth. Considering many of the beers here are 5%+ it might be best to uber anyway.I really enjoyed the beer at Brewyard. They had a great selection and offer flights so you can sample lots of different flavors. I loved that they had a variety of styles too - Saisons, Reds, Seasonals,etc. I really liked seeing their creativity in brewing and the beers were all very good. The vibe is much more like Eagle Rock Brewery or Frogtown Brewing Co than Golden Road which is a major plus for me. My only complaint was based on other reviews, I thought they would have food but when we got there the truck had already closed. Very small issue overall and not a deal breaker. Now I know for next time. If you're doing a brewery tour of NELA it would be a good spot to hit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller
40,Watch out for the Trolls under the bridge,"What a surprise, it was difficult to find this place. Finally we found ourselves under a bridge near an industrial park. The parking is not great you have to park under a bridge and walk pass homeless guy sleeping under the bridge, actually he makes a for a good security guard well worth a few dollars tip. When you finally get inside- WOW! worth the adventure- the beer was excellent, the service was great and the atmosphere was spectacular- well decorated. Looking forward to my next visit, but do a map check using your GPS will get you lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomgsells
