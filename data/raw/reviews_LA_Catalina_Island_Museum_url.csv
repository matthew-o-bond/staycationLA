50,Great New Museum!,"If you are thinking of the small, cramped former location in the Casino building, think again. This museum is a must-see!I especially enjoyed the area dedicated to the S.S. Catalina steamship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robtE3808JU
40,Easy walk from the ferry.,"We enjoyed learning about the history of the island-the Wrigley's, the Cubs and the movie stars. I thought it was interesting to see pictures of Charlie Chaplin without makeup. It took us about an hour to go through. We also enjoyed the outdoor sculptures. I did think it was a shame that the beautiful Chihuly chandelier wasn't in a more prominent, open area. Hiding it in a gazebo didn't seem to do it justice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelK5929
40,Small but nice,"We went to see the display about the Cubs, which is small. The museum is nice, though, and we're glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethannk
50,Fun to see history of Island,Small but informative museum. Enjoyed the exhibit on Esther Williams. Don't forget to go upstairs see the outdoor sculptures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateInCali
30,Good overview,"The museum is predictably small, but includes some very interesting Native American artifacts, a great into movie, and very good exhibits about the history of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545charlies
40,Very informative,"Learned everything I needed to know about the history of Catalina and Avalon. A must see, especially if you like old movie history. Many iconic films were made here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickg803
30,Interesting but probably not worth the price of admission,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer: There’s some interesting Catalina Island history exhibits and some interesting outdoor artwork upstairs and an interesting movie and an interesting Catalina Island ceramics display...but $17 ($15 seniors) seems rather steep for the experience, I’m sorry to say. Perhaps it’s the pricy location that governs the ticket price. If you have some interest in learning about the Island’s history, then spend your $$ and get a history lesson and visit the rooftop art display. ~1.25 hrs later you’ll be out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLVAGUY
30,Interesting but in no way worth the price,"Cute little museum with interesting history of the island, but wow it is not worth $17 per person! They should be charging $7, and even that would feel like a generous donation for what you get. I do not recommend paying that fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465jakes
50,Charming and informative,Lovely small museum that sets the stage for an island visit. Good information of the Native American inhabitants of the Island as well as the Hollywood playground eras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjm5749

50,Interesting little museum,"I have been here several times, both before & after their move to their new location on metropole avenue. The museum radically improved after their move to their new building. First, the new building is lovely. The have a beautiful outdoor patio on the second floor. The permanent exhibit is a history of Catalina island, including some of the famous people who have lived there. The have changing special exhibits. I have seen several different ones there, & each one has been excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylottama
50,"Small, but worth visiting","A small museum, but very nice. Enjoyed learning more on the history of Catalina Island. Also enjoyed the art work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Racetothefinish
40,Small but comprehensive museum,"This museum provides a great overview of the island history, along with the unique artist exhibition on the roof. Price was $17 for adults or $15 for seniors. Begin with the 20 minute film about the history of Catalina Island. It doesn’t matter when you join the film it runs in a continuous loop.Great section on the Wrigley family along with old Hollywood star associated with the island. Even HarryHoudini made a movie on the island. The museum even discusses the death of Natalie Wood in 1982.Takes about one hour to do the exhibits, unless you’re very thorough and then maybe an hour and a half. The museum is totally accessible for someone in a wheelchair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcc55-sd
50,A First-Rate Small Museum,"We think the Catalina Island Museum (the Ada Blanche Wrigley Schreiner Building located on Metropole Ave.) is a gem.It has a permanent exhibit that presents many aspects of the history of the island, special exhibitions and outdoor spaces with artwork..We thought the permanent exhibit was excellent. The graphics are exceptionally good; where many venues have graphics that grab ones attention but don't provide much information or vice versa, the Catalina Island Museum's permanent exhibit does both. And the scope of the island history covered is very broad. Our only regret is that we didn't budget more time to be at the Museum.During our visit, there were three temporary exhibits. Two also dealt with the island's history -- Wrigley's Catalina: A Centennial Celebration, which will be there until January of 2020, and Bird Park: An Aviary for Avalon's Celebrity Birds, which will close in mid-August. We enjoyed both. The other -- Elizabeth Turk: Tipping Point -- is artistic and most unusual. Unfortunately, half of it was closed the day we visited due to a low-tech problem, the use of the wrong paint in the area surrounding what must be an amazing circular metal screen. It is scheduled to be open until March of 2020 and will provide another great incentive to visit the Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesB9722ER
50,Catalina Island Museum,Excellent and very informative museum. Easy to walk to from the town center. There is lots of information about the many movie stars that frequented the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaudetteS766

40,Allow One Hour,"We found the $17 entry fee on the expensive side but we did enjoy reading all about the Wrigley family, Marilyn Monroe and movies filmed on the island. They have a lovely Chihuly piece outside on the topfloor from an exhibit. Start your visit by watching a short film about the history of the island. It was very interesting. They have a cute gift store with expensive prices. Their pottery exhibit was nicely presented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpatters
50,Great Small Museum in Downtown Avalon,"We did not plan on coming here, but were told by others when we were.going around Avalon that it was good and we were curious as to the history of Catalina and the Wrigley Family. This is in a building new in 2016 and it works well. This is not heavy lifting, but well presented and clean with lots of information. We worth a bit more than an hour (they say 45 minutes, but we read everything and it is twice that really).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11douglast
50,A bit pricey,"For a small museum, the admission is pretty steep ($17), but we enjoyed the exhibits. Lots of photos, a few interesting artifacts. A pretty space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
40,Informative and leisurely,"This is a great little museum to spend a couple hours at. They’re open every day from 10-5 with the exception of major holidays. A ticket from the Casino tour provides a $2 discount.The museum is well laid out and provides a lot of great information about the island. There’s a short video you can watch before you start exploring the rest of the exhibit.My one critique is that the film doesn’t have subtitles which would make it more accessible to visitors with deafness or hearing impairment. In addition, I didn’t notice any braille either, so just some accessibility issues to be aware of prior to visiting. These weren’t issues for me or my husband, but something I noticed could be improved.All in all, a great place to spend a couple of hours while visiting Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cc_seattle_wa

50,Great way to better understand the history of Catalina,We were in Catalina for the first time and wanted to know about the history of the island. This museum was perfect for an historical overview. Well worth the time and price of admission!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDB51
40,Nice history of island films,The first activity is a set of quick films giving you island history. Informative and kept our attention. The oil paintings had nice descriptions and staff even explained an art technique that added light to one painting. The special display was colorful sculptures. We ended with a display of pottery made from island clay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svf1991
40,"Nice collection, good docents","We enjoyed the Museum’s history exhibits very much. Colorful collection of stories, stars and ordinary citizens. Would have preferred more on island history pre-Wrigley and a better understanding of how Native Americans continue to contribute to the community. New docents were very good and eager to share personal stories related to the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreqWanderer
50,Old Hollywood amid memorable scenery,Another place for your “must do” while visiting list. In the hey days of film this was a primary destination for the rich and famous and the museum and adjoining movie theater along with the famous casino are some of the greatest architecture of Southern California. Movie history mixes with big game fishing and the adventures world renown author and sportsman Zane Grey. Something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodbd

50,"Very pretty museum, knowledgeable curator","My father, brother and I visited on a quiet Sunday and learned so much about the history of the island, and of Avalon. There was a nice exhibit on Impressionistic paintings of the island, many of which predated the Casino--when there existed a large stone outcropping that since has been demolished for the Casino.One of the women working that Sunday was very informative and engaging; she gave us a lot of insight into the island's history as well as painting methods. It's great to see this caliber of curation and stewardship in a museum of this size.The rooftop space was a pleasant surprise--a gorgeous Chihuly chandelier, stage/seating and open area that would be fantastic for private events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmiMahon
40,More than we expected,"An investment has clearly been made in this museum in such a tiny community ... congratulations to all involved. The exhibitions were pretty good. The site itself is a little chopped-up and doesn't flow well, but that may be a function of when and how they were able to add onto it. I never got a straight answer about whether the Catalina pottery still operates or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EcoArtTraveler
30,Museum,"One of the spots to visit when In Catalina is the museum, they have nice exhibits and can spent time understanding the ha of the island, best yet is whinin walking distance of the restaurants and the social live. From there you can take the shuttle ( the “bus”stop) it’s right in front of the museum and you can pick your next destination for example the botanical garden, descanso beach or the casino best yet only $2.00 to ride vs the $90 dollars per hr for renting the golf car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/analaramirez
50,Informative exhibits and great outdoor spaces,Great new museum including a much needed exhibit on the native Indians and the horrific grave stealing by Gliddens! The movie was a nice historical perspective of the island and those humans who played here. A more inclusive exhibit on the island wildlife would be a great addition! Loved the island pottery exhibit 👍,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppyh

50,Great little musuem,This is a great little museum that documents the who's who of Catalina's visitors. You get a great picture of the past and see how it has shaped the current laid back feel of the island. The rooftop sculptures and Houdini room were added bonuses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KandyR_12
50,Interesting mix of displays,There is a nice introductory video about the history of Catalina and Avalon.We enjoyed the historical displays as well as information about the famous actors who had been in movies filmed at Catalina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_Sabael
20,Content lacking,"Disappointed in the thin display of Catalina/Avalon history compared to the large venues available for social functions in the building. It seems the artifacts on display are there for decorating the various social spaces, rather than telling the fascinating and colorful story of Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekevin12345

40,A nice small museum on an island with more visitors than residents !,Lovely museum with an amazing collection considering the small size of the island. Worth a visit. They get worthwhile touring exhibits. When I was there they has two terrific exhibits on Houdini and Jaws !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carly1Esq
50,Very interesting,The museum not only had the history of Catalina but also highlighted the art of a modern sculpted. A must when you visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z15AJmaryl
50,Love to Visit Catalina Island Museum,"What a beautiful Museum in Avalon, well worth a visit! Recommend to all ages for historical documentary film, art and Catalina Pottery collection. Much improved and outstanding gift to the community of Avalon. See to appreciate all the outstanding displays .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjoc738
40,Nice!,"Beautiful museum. However, it needs to have more exhibits, lacks a little in that area, a lot of un-used space. What they have done with it is amazing and hopefully in the future will offer more interesting exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatdoyouwhat
40,museum modern,"Exhibits are interesting. The building is spacious, and modern. The former site at the Casino was cramped & gave insight into vintage Catalina island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
50,A must see for tourists.,"Just wanted to learn more about Catalina Island. It had a short movie about the Islands history and plenty of historical fact about WWII, baseball, and the role of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265kylev
50,Do NOT miss this fantastic tribute to Catalina Island and it's unique history!,"We have been coming to Catalina for about 30 years and I am still finding new facts and interesting exhibits at this new museum. I love the movie, love the Chicago Cubs history, the movie stars, the special exhibits (Chihully glass, JAWS, Houdini...) and of course the ancient history and the NATALIE WOOD MYSTERY! The museum has done a wonderful job making the exhibits user friendly and interesting. I get bored at museums but I now can shoot through the entire museum with my guests in about 30 minutes. Don't do that, but with all there is to do on the Island I can't torture my guests and end up often dragging them in and paying for them. They always are happy with the tour and sing my praises as a great tour guide...by the way, I joined the museum and think that it is a bargain and very worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyh303
50,Not to be Missed,"Hidden away in a residential area is a lovely small museum worthy of a visit. We happened upon the museum in the evening and were thrilled to find out the exhibit was works by Chihuly, the glass artist magically lite up at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianaw580
40,A visit to the island past,"The recently built Catalina Island Museum is a beautiful building with fantastic tile work.When we visited this summer, there was a permanent exhibit about the history of the island, as well as two temporary exhibits about films made on Catalina. The Houdini exhibit were mostly stills of a rare and long forgotten film Houdini made in 1920. The other was mainly a demonstration of how the different mechanical sharks worked in Jaws. There is also an exhibit of wonderful Laguna Pottery. The exhibits were modest in nature but interesting. And the building was worth the trip. The Catalina Museum is open daily from 10-5, and hosts a variety of different events. A lovely spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_ivypruett
50,Highly Recommended!,"The ""Jaws"" exhibit at the Catalina Island Museum was the primary reason we traveled to Catalina Island to being with. And it did not disappoint. Nor did the rest of the museum. They had several wonderful exhibits, including a Harry Houdini exhibit and the history of Catalina Island, as well as several other highlights. The gift shop was great, and while we weren't able to attend, they were having a free movie that evening that was included with the museum admission price. Beautiful place, and would definitely visit again, whenever we're back on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilmScoreComposer
50,Must Visit,"You really must visit the museum when on the island. It offers a wonderful stroll through the history of Catalina. The exhibits are equally well done and it has a nice shop, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gailanna
20,Meh...,"Admission should be like $8, there's not much to this place. The Houdini exhibit was a joke. Literally the size of my walk-in closet and a total bore. Also there's no closed captioning for the hearing impaired. I have no hearing issues and still couldn't understand the film at the beginning or the one on exhibit. Skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candace74
40,"History of Catalina, it's all here, a must-stop","Well as I'm a fan of little Museum, I had to stop. I had to check it out. I did check it out. And it was worth my time. I learned so much about Catalina and the City of Avalon and its history and the big fires they've had and the bankruptcies and the Cubbies coming to play here in practice and more things than I ever knew about Catalina Island and the City of Avalon. Some people might think this is all good for locals only, but I think the history is exciting enough that everybody and what's going on before us here in Avalon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays

50,Love This Place,"This is a great museum. We saw the Chihuly glass exhibit last year and this year there was an exhibit about the making of ""Jaws"" and a Houdini exhibit. Very interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811kathyd
50,Jaws movie exhibit,"The beautiful museum is compact and varied with their exhibits. The Jaws exhibit explained how movies are made to scare people, a mini version of Universal Studios' ride that might no longer be open. I thought the admission was a little pricey especially since there were no family rates. Enjoyed browsing in the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5476LKruthh
50,A must!!!,Incredible place to learn new things! Jaws exhibit and things about the island and wringley. A good place to take kids and friends. You won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liaandjp1
50,Exceptionally well curated exhibits!,"We popped into the museum one afternoon with our group of 4 teens. We enjoyed three different exhibits, each with its own unique perspective. The history of the island exhibit shed light on several stories we'd heard about the island, while the Jaws exhibit provided a behind-the-scenes peek at how the movie was made. The story boards and artist concept pictures were really interesting! Upstairs, the Houdini exhibit provided insight into the early days of the film industry on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624shannonm
40,Nice new museum,The Jaws exhibit was fun. Houdini a little disappointing. History of Avalon was good. Nice gift shop. I'd go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglasr513
40,Learn about Catalina Island,It cost us $17 pp to go through this museum. We wanted to learn about Catalina's history and this gave us a good insight of the island. The current exhibitions was 1) Harry Houdini's film he filmed at Catalina and 2) The filming of Jaws.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RW84074
30,Visit To Catalina Museum,"In our opinion, the admission price was way too expensive. We spent about an hour in the museum and saw everything. The introductory movie was great but that was about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorrieLarryM
50,Great Island History Museum,"Beautifully kept and fascinating museum that provides the history and inside facts about the island. Donated by the Wrigley family, it has a nice section on the Cubs when they trained in the spring on the island. Lot’s of tidbits and features of past Hollywood stars getting away on the island, as well as, major movies that were filmed there, e.g., Mutiny on the Bounty. Great art exhibits that are changed over time. Not sure if the Jaws exhibit is permanent but it was fascinating. Lot’s of actual movie props used in the film, as well as, scripts, scene layouts and sketches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112royf
40,"Small museum, good for an hour or so",The Jaws exhibit was very interesting. Loved the local photos and history of Catalina and Wrigley. Some nice Chihuly pieces. Very small museum but nice introductory film.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dermgoddess
30,Brand new location but lacking in depth,Catalina Island has a fairly recent modern history (<100 years) but this museum didn't really catch all of this. There was a 9 minute movie preceding our self guided tour and I felt that the information in the movie wasn't repeated in the evidence on the tour. There was a brief mention in the movie about the brothers who first developed the island but not much more after that. How did they get the bison over to the island? Movie posters about movies filmed there. How did Ava Wrigley create her garden? What is Mt Ada Hotel? What about the Zane Grey Pueblo? What and where do the divers come for? There was so much more that they could have included. We visited a diving museum in the Keys and it was stuffed with items and pictures and information. This place just seemed sparce.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frugalshopper
40,Great local museum,Small but nice little local museum. Lovely roof top area to relax. Plenty of local history and facts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LornaP144

50,"At last, Catalina has the museum it deserves","At last! Catalina has the museum it deserves, a museum which, while appropriately modest in size, is definitely world class in presentation. The professional curating, the thoughtful layout, the creativity -- I felt like I was in a section of one of L.A., New York, or Boston's finest. Never has the island's varied and fascinating history been presented so thoroughly and well. And fortunately, the gift shop is every bit the equal of the rest of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690
40,Excellent history of island,Small museum which covers the history of Catalina. At the time of our visit it also had a small/beautiful exhibit of Dale Chihuly's glasswork.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
40,Learn about the island in a fun way,"This is a very nice museum where you'll learn a lot about this island's history: natural, Native American, and Hollywood-centric. The gift shop has an excellent number of Catalina island tiles for sale at prices comparable to the gift stores. The Chihuly glass light on the upper level was a surprise we could see from the road outside. I'd have given it 5 stars, but it was a tad pricey entrance, but I don't begrudge them, the museum is very well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
50,Who Knew?,"This is a great little museum full of information regarding Catalina Island, the city of Avalon & all the famous people who've been there. Marilyn Monroe lived on the island when she married to hubby #1 as Norma Jean Baker. From there she went on to Hollywood. Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, George Harrison, Natalie Woods, Robert Wagner, Ronald Reagan, the Chicago Cubs, Charlie Chan, just to name a few of the other famous people who frequented the Island. There's informative film clips about the history as well as the big fire. I highly recommend & definitely worth a visit.TIP: The museum ticket will get you a couple dollars off the Casino tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lexibelle
50,When I lived at CATALINA ISLAND,When you live at Catalina you have to have some history so where do you go you go to the museum and you get some history so when you live there and you run into people who don't know absolutely anything about the island and you have a job where you have to know everything about the island you have your history it's a good thing to know sometimes you can go there and brush up on your things brush up on old things it's like the Catalina Island theater I went there and be inside is bliss you can actually find a seat and you can actually here the movie it is awesome and if you've never gone to a movie theater that is so beautiful inside and it's So Graceful inside you will never experience anything just go see a movie somewhere that is so beautiful so Graceful and so written with life you need to do this do something for yourself or was someone that you care about or love and experience it together the the theater makes the movie even better the museum makes Catalina even better sure you can go in line and see the buffalo but to be a volunteer on the island is even better and it be a volunteer I've been a volunteer on my life ever since I was a kid I experienced being volunteer on the island as something I never thought they could be so fulfilling it was fun it was an experience and you got to do things that no one else did it was the best part of my life and it could be yours too just go experience something go do something that you have never done I did and it's something I'll never get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FREESPIRITEDGYPSYESS
40,New and growing,"The new Island Museum, opened last year, is a vast improvement. It is modern, chic, attractive and easy to navigate. We just missed the Chihuly glass exhibit - a real shame as pictures of it were terrific. The general collections are well done, informative and nicely displayed. The current exhibit (Feb. 2018) was not to our taste, but there are exhibits coming up that seem quite worthwhile. TIP: Take the 90 minute Casino tour, save your tickets, and you will get museum entrance free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsacerdo
30,Gift shop visit,I rated my visit as average because I only went inside the gift shop and restroom. The gift shop actually had good stuff along with good prices. I picked up a few souveniers to take home. The building was very clean and seemed to have several exhibits setup for visitors. The restroom was very clean. The greeter was very friendly and informative upon entering the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianadenise
40,Rotating exhibits,"The day we were there, they were changing exhibits, so we decided not to enter since there wasn’t much to see. We were sad to miss the Chihuly which sounded amazing, but I’m sure the next exhibits will be wonderful also. The permanent exhibit is not very large though. However, we did thoroughly enjoy the gift shop. The staff was very helpful and informative, and we purchased some beautiful Catalina tile replicas. The building is new and very beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
30,"High expectations, average museum","After reading the reviews, we had high expectations about this place. It is a nice place and maybe when they had the glass exhibition was really great, but if is unfair to rate based on a rotating exhibition. The non rotating exhibition is just average.It is very small, a nice overview of Avalon history, few pieces of arts in the second floor...... and that's all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyFavoritesPlaces
50,Wonderful exhibition,"They have rotating exhibitions so it's always different apparently, but for my visit they had Posada. Which is like Day of the Dead themed. It is such an amazing experienced.

50,Great venue rich in Catalina culture!,"Beautiful architecture mimicking the Casino houses a great collection of Catalina culture. The museum is small but that makes it easy to visit if you are only on the island for the day. Hollywood aficionados will love the exhibits detailing the rich historical connection between Hollywood and Santa Catalina island and sports aficianodos will appreciate the exhibits detailing the Wrigley connection. The building is a lovely mix of indoor and outdoor gallery and exhibition spaces which feature their permanent collection as well as impressive visiting artists' work. They have a store with a wide variety of merchandise, including Catalina pottery, but no cafe. Well worth your time to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/obiboo
50,Spoiled!,"Justa beautifulMuseum, upgraded to host the incomparable Dale Chihuly exhibit! World-class presentation, beautifully-curated and interpreted by dedicated volunteer staff who worked their tails off for 9 months. I hope they were able to lassoo the spectacular 'sun'-colored chandelier for all the trouble they went to in putting on the exhibit! Fine gift-shop too. Altogether very rewarding experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbrook2016
50,Good overview of history and amazing special exhibit,We went to the Catalina museum to see the Chiluilly exhibit and were very impressed by the entire museum. The movie gave a good overview of the history of the island. The exhibit gave more details. The Chiluilly special exhibit was wonderful and the volunteer added flavor and knowledge to the specific pieces as we roamed around. The setting is peaceful and a delightful way to spend time in Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside802871
50,Nice museum and the Chihulys were great!,"This isn’t a large place, but it’s a very nice facility they told us had only opened in 2016. You start by watching a film in a small gallery, which is presented in newsreel style and includes some history of the island including native American inhabitants, early development, the fires of 1915 and 2007, Wrigley’s acquisition of much of the island, and its use as a playground for the rich and famous. The standing exhibits emphasize these same topics, plus there's a wall about Old Ben the sea lion, and a gift shop. There are panel exhibits about The Cubs, John Wane, Ronald Reagan, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and others. We felt privileged to visit during one of the last days of the 2017 exhibit of Dale Chihuly Art. While we’ve seen Chihuly artwork before in several settings, this was well-displayed in the museum’s courtyard, on a rooftop area which includes an indoor exhibit area, and an exhibit room on the main floor. This museum, and a walk around the Catalina Casino, were easily our favorites of the things we saw on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmarkwind
50,Check it Out,Beautiful and educational displays of the history of Catalina Island. There are revolving special exhibits. We were lucky enough to see a display of Chihuly glasswork.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BFWPa
50,Hidden gem,This small museum is big on art and history. The history of Catalina Island is told in film and pictures. There is also a fantastic exhibition of Chihooly glass. Well worth the admission. Staff is friendly and helpful and there is a very nice gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/976lisar
50,great musuem,Great museum for explaining the history of the island. We went specifically for the Chihuly exhibit and it was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott_0100
40,Small but quite nice,"I have seen many museums throughout the years. Comparatively, this museum is one the small size but quite nice. You will learn about the island history quite a bit.The glass exhibition, Chihuly, is very impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294dannyv
10,Did Not Go,"The charge is $17.00!!!!!! The Louvre is € 9!!!! I am sure it is interesting but are you kidding? Once you are here, there is virtually nothing to do that isn' t stupidly expensive. We ended up walking a lot, which is fine. If you want more, get ready to spend too much for what you get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FGard
50,Highly Recommend,Enjoyed this museum! Staff was friendly sharing their knowledge. Short Film on the history of the Island was informative. Chihuly is the featured temporary exhibit and was displayed beautifully. The Chicago Cubs Baseball Team exhibit is a must see. Highly Recommend !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RozeMary
50,Loved the Chihuly!,"We took a day trip to Catalina specifically to see the Chihuly exhibit at this museum. Last time we were on the island, this museum was located in the Casino building. It’s now in a beautiful new venue with a more central location. Although we mainly went to see the Chihuly Glass, the rest of the exhibits about the history of the island were very interesting. It’s definitely worth a visit, and not too time-consuming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB1114
50,Great small museum,Great little museum! We saw the Chihuly exhibit which was terrific - don’t miss it! I especially loved all of the history of the island and the many celebrities who spent time here. Well presented and easy to follow. They have a very nice outdoor area for movies. Nice spot for weddings!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimW551
50,Chihuly Glass Exhibit and History of the Island,"On a recent cruise we discovered the Catalina Island Museum totally by accident, As we were walking along the shoreline in Avalon we spotted a banner suspended across the roadway announcing an exhibition of Chihuly glass at the museum.Having visited the Chihuly Gardens and Glass in Seattle Center in 2016, we decided to go see this exhibit as well. We were not disappointed. While much smaller in scope and size, it is just as magnificent to view. The Chihuly exhibit is on display until early December 2017.It was the Chihuly exhibit that drew us to the museum, but the permanent exhibits are just as interesting. Tracing the history of Catalina Island and Avalon, those exhibits provide detail about the development of the island, the Wrigley family ties to the island, the rise of Norma Jean, and a wide variety of stories and pictures related to the famous and not-so-famous visitors to the island over the years.The museum is a welcome respite from the touristy elements of Avalon. It is a great attraction for old and young alike. Allow yourself a couple of hours to take in all that is offered. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvToCruise4001
50,A Place to SEE,The museum was amazing and we got to see the Chihuly Glass Exhibit and it was beyond beautiful. The building is very nicely laid out inside and the museum was excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727JaneA

50,Beautiful,The museum was so interesting to us. We found out things that we didn't know about the island and its history. Chihuly was on exhibit while we were there. It was displayed so beautifully.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyhJ7696GF
40,Small but nice museum.,The museum covers the history of the island. It has some interesting things I didn't know. Norma Jean lived on the island before she became the famous movie star Marilyn Monroe. The entire island was taken over by the merchant marines during the second world war. There is also a lot of stuff about baseball because the island was owned by the same guy who owned the Cubs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidP7119
50,Saw the Chihuly exhibit and it's amazing.,"Saw the Chihuly exhibit and it's amazing. Went Nov 8th and the exhibit is there until December 11, 2017.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julsgarden

Lots of lovely galleries and always a special exhibit as well which of us was Chiuhly glass. Extraordiary and worthwhile,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6sandy6
50,Chihuly!,"We happened to be on island the same time as the Dale Chihuly exhibit and it was a nice down time for us. If you have a chance to see it before it leaves in December, I recommend a peek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyomaha
50,Chihuly Glass Exhibit at the Museum,History of Catalina Island is well presented in a new museum building.The Chihuly artwork 'glass flowers' exhibit is a 'must see'. The artwork is spread outthroughout the museum including the roof top with a fabulous view. The staff and docents are welcoming and knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneS997
50,Brand New Museum. A must see,For years the museum was in a small area in the Casino building.For the last several years they have been planning this new museum by purchasing property and designing it from the ground up. They have displays dating from the native americansto the golden years of movie making and how the Island was used during WWII. They also have various exhibits which rotate from time to time. We were so pleased to see this new jewel and have become members.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmF5998NU
50,HISTORY AND ENTERTAINMENT,What a great collection of the Island's memories and current events. Was able to go back in time and learn great moments of history on the island and also caught the amazing Chihuly exhibition all in one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELERMANIA
40,Interesting history of island,"This small museum features Catalina history and some other special, temporary exhibit. I enjoyed both. You can spend about an hour there. At $17, admission is pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712robinp
50,Must visit site,"This new museum has a video & exhibits showcasing Catalina's history over the years: Wrigley & his Cubs baseball team, movie stars & celebrities, Catalina Tile Factory, Bird Park, old steamers, etc. Truly a must-see to appreciate Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyM2886
40,Catalina island museum,Glass exhibit is wonderful as is the movie on Dale Chihuly. The movie part on the history of Catalina is good but odd the way the produced it as news reels. The exhibits are good but a bit too much attention placed on movie stars and famous people. I love history and would prefer more information on the pre-Wrigley ownership of the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSpencerCSmith
40,The glass display was very beautiful,"They currently are featuring a Dale Chihuly glass sculpture exhibit that is very beautiful and worth seeing. Will only be there for a couple more months. The regular museum has pictures and information on some of the actors/actresses from the 50s-70s and other historical information about the island. It is a small museum. Entrance fee is $17 adults. If you take the guided tour of the Casino on the island first, they told us to show our tickets and we would get a discount at the museum. Went to the museum first and the Casino tour the next day, so not sure what the discount would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebeccora
20,I've experienced better but don't let me discourage you,"I'm really not a museum person but my friend likes to visit them. I will admit I have been to some museums because of her and this one for ME was not worth $17. There is not much to see, we walked through the exhibits pretty quick. Not to take anything away from the Museum because I did enjoy the short history film about the island and the blown glass was pretty impressive...but that was it. Don't let me discourage you from visiting, see for yourself. I posted some pictures of the blown glass below, enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grappler9
40,A must when visiting,"Expensive. Brand new. Starts with video of Catalina history and history of presenting artist. Small exhibits on Catalina history, then the guest artist exhibit was amazing as well. You have to do it at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnmarieKKeiramnnA
50,Pleasantly Surprised!,I wasn't aware Catalina had a Museum. I learned a lot about the island's history. I was blown away by the Chihuly exhibit. Each piece is truly breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamB77
50,"Very nice local museum, with excellent special exhibits","The special Chihuly exhibit was the reason for this trip to Catalina. It was the first time we had been to the museum since the new facility was built and it didn't disappoint. The Chihuly exhibit was much larger than we anticipated, with many pieces from Dale Chihuly's private collection, never before displayed. We arrived at 10 AM sharp as the museum was opening, and we were able to view all the pieces before anyone else arrived, with excellent photo opportunities. The ongoing exhibits of Catalina history, etc. were well laid out and certainly worth spending some time viewing. There was a wedding taking place that day and we therefore were given discounts on admission, even though the setup for the wedding didn't interfere with our visit. One of the staff gave me an overview of upcoming exhibits, many of which we will be back to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjaronoff
50,interesting little museum,"they had a glass exhibit going on well we were there that wasvery, very beautiful and they had a short film to watch aboutthe island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117joanl
50,A feast for the eyes and soul,"Went over for the day to see the Chihuly exhibit. This is a must see show. We have been taught to ""look with our eyes not with our hands"" but it will take a lot of self discipline to keep your hands in your pockets! The works are fantastic and you just want to reach out - but DON'T! The exhibit is here until December 11th. I have followed his work since the early 1980s - the work is magical. Going to the island is like having a vacation for a day. It is just an hour and 15 minutes from LA or Orange County.If you also take the time to visit the other exhibits you will need over an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Food-Art-Lover
50,Lovely museum,Visited the museum for the Chihuly exhibit - very impressive. Enjoyed the exhibit of information on celebrities with connection to Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/572pamm

50,Chihuly Exhibition,WOW! The artist & his team are amazing. To see what can be done with blown glass & the beauty that was created was wonderful. Take a guided tour if you can to learn more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyo854
50,Surprisingly a great museum!,"I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this museum. I didn't think it would be much since we were on such a little island but it told the great history of the island and a beautiful Chihuly exhibit throughout the museum, which is larger than it looks. It wasn't that expensive for entrance, but while on the island everybody should support it as it is a rather new addition to the island and what a great benefit to the community. Please note they do not allow food or drink or large bags while going through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicytravelasian
50,"Basic museum OK, Chihuly exhibit a smash",The basic museum was interesting but not very inspiring. The temporary exhibit of Chihuly blown-glass sculptures was fantastic. My wife had seen some of his exhibits in Denver. I had not and was completely blown away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/600jamess600

50,Chihuly Glass was amazing,go now before December when the Chihuly exhibit ends. Gorgeous up close and stunning display. Informative movie to start your visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinfan3
50,A Marvelous Museum Experience,"We were so very impressed and delighted by Catalina's new Museum. Wonderful , entertaining accounts of the islands past are one impressive and enjoyable aspect of the museum, but the Chihuly Exhibit was the real thrill of our visit. The glass works were so beautifully displayed and the museum's staff members were so very welcoming and eager to share information about the collection. The building itself is a wonderful structure and was such a pleasure to visit.We will look forward to a return visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RexGoliath
50,Dont miss the Chihuly Exhibit.,"The very reason we came to the Island was to see the Chihuly exhibit. We were pleasantly surprised by the new modern museum. We first enjoyed the well displayed exhibits of the history of Avalon and the Island. Chihuly is my favorite artist and there are many of his amazing glass creations on display here, both inside and outside. My favorites are the Seaforms, but there is no denying that to see the sun glistening on the garden of glass ""Mille fiori"" cannot be a disappointment to anyone.. This is worth the trip to Catalina, just to see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugarmillgirl
50,Wonderful gem,"The Chihuly exhibit is a must see. Beautiful! Cubs exhibit is a must for fans, detailing an era that most probably don't know about. A wonderful space and great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3202CPsteveh

Movie history, sports history and more are covered. The museum is a must visit destination for those interested in learning more about Catalina.We visited on a Thursday so that we could attend the ""Chihuly After Dark"" exhibit. The museum allowed us to wander and see the exhibits during the day - leave for dinner - and return for the night time event. Seeing Chihuly artwork during the day and the incredible transformation at night was particularly special.The staff at the museum are all cordial and hard working. The museum is well maintained and very welcoming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603katyl
50,Wonderful museum!,We heard rave reviews of the Gihuli art glass exhibit from other people we met on the island. We decided to take a look so we spent a few hours on our last day at the museum. It has only been open in this new location for 2 years and the exhibits are beautifully curated. There is a movie which tells about the history of the island and also the current Gihuli exhibit which is on loan until later this year. We then toured the museum and learned so much about Catalina Island. The glassworks are exhibited throughout the interior and gardens and should not be missed. We loved every minute of our visit and highly recommend this experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hbmama3
50,Chihuly exhibit,"What a wonderful surprise. The new museum is wonderful. The opening video is interesting, full of information, and well done. We've seen a few Chihuly exhibits - this one is spectacular. Worth a trip to Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaulzalman
50,Chihuly exhibit an added bonus to historic galleries,"I missed visiting this museum when I came to Catalina last year. I'm sort of glad I did, because the current temporary exhibit (through 12/11/17) is Dale Chihuly, whose work I'm somewhat familiar with, having stayed at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and having visited his permanent museum in Seattle (Chihuly Garden and Glass) and his current exhibit (closing 10/29/17) at the New York Botanical Garden.The museum itself has been housed in this new building on Metropole Ave.for a little over a year. It used to be on the ground floor of the Casino. The architecture is a blend of Spanish Mission style with Art Deco influences with generous homages to Catalina tiles and even the marquee of Chicago's Wrigley Field. There are lovely indoor and outdoor spaces; the place was designed to be able to host private events easily. There's even an outdoor amphitheatre that shows movies on a large wall during the summer.Inside, the soaring and bright entry lobby currently houses a huge Chihuly chandelier. A visit should begin in the theatre, which currently shows 2 brief films about Catalina's history and Chihuly.The first galleries house the permanent History of Catalina Island exhibit, with the profound, indelible influence William Wrigley Jr. had on the island's history and development after he purchased it. Most fascinating for me were the island's ties to Hollywood glitterati in the early to mid-1900's, especially a very young Marilyn Monroe and a tragic Natalie Wood.The Chihuly exhibit starts on the ground floor with smaller bowl/basket pieces, with much larger installations outdoors upstairs. It's a small exhibit in a small museum, but a number of Chihuly's styles and phases of glass blowing are represented.There's also a little piece on Old Ben, the friendly sea lion who has a statue near the boat dock.A great and educational few hours. Every Catalina visitor should learn about its history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pillowsofwanderlust

50,Beautiful Museum and Beautiful Chihuly Glass Exhibit!,The Catalina Island Museum has settled into its new home on Metropole Street and is a beautiful natural light-filled building that serves as a magnifying glass for Chihuly glass sculptures and vessels.

50,Chihuly Exhibit - Go now before it's gone!,"It's worth the trip to Catalina. It's worth the trip to the Musuem. It you like Dale Chihuly, there is an outstanding exhibit of his ""seaforms"" and ""persians"" and chandeliers at the Catalina Island Museum, as well as several outdoor exhibitions. Put in place and exhibited by Dale Chihuly himself from his personal collection, it is only there until (I think) December 2017, so HURRY! Thank goodness there is a high speed catamaran from Long Beach or San Pedro to get you there. Go see the exhibit before it's gone!And, while you're there, spend some time in the rest of the Museum, too. There's a great background on the landmark Casino, the early 20th Century fire, noteworthy Island figures (Marilyn Monroe, Humphrey Bogart, Erroll Flynn and others). The museum staffers, by the way, have wonderful stories to tell about the exhibit, as well as the rest of the museum. The museum admission price is modest, and to see Chihuly, it's one of the best deals in Avalon! Just go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skipjack906

50,Make this your fist stop to learn island history,"Great little gem just a couple blocks up Metropole Street! A well-curated exhibit tells you the history of the island, the Wrigley's, and all the celebrities who spent time here. Also, through mid-December, there's a beautiful Chihuly glass exhibit.

50,Chihuly marriage with beautiful newmuseum,"The new museum is a spectacular building with interwoven levels, overlooking gardens and patios and outdoor amphitheater. It is one year old. The plan to have chihuly do an installation there was decided when the building was still in the planning phases. Chihuly asked for a copy of the blueprints and custom designed works to fit perfectly in a he designed spaces. I have seen chihuly installations in botanical gardens and other museums but this one was so well matched to a fabulous building, it really shouldn't be missed. Fabulous bowls can be viewed sitting on black glossy tables so reflections are amazing. There is no glass partition separating you from his works. The bowls appear to float at times. The works outside glow at night with spectacular lighting. There is also an indepth documentary showing on chihuly and his genius and drive to share and inspire art everywhere to all. Well worth the visit and price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancycA5997LT

40,Great for Catalina history,I assumed Catalina had a cool history and this museum explained it all. It was awesome to see all the historical figures that contributed to the island's history. I didn't really care about all the Chuhuly glass when I went in but it really is quite beautiful. The museum was a good way to spend an hour before doing our shore excursion and I learned a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bunk1976

50,good history movie,"Went to island museum, spent about 1.5 hours. first viewed the historical movie, got a glimpse of island history. then we saw the marvelous art of glassblowing. Kids love it. Adults too.$17 for adult, kids are free.worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindalH8945HB
40,Thorough history of Catalina Island and a beautiful Chihuly Exhibit,"We have been to Catalina Island at least a dozen times and had never learned so much about its history! The two short introductory films helped us to focus on what we were about to see. We were interested in the history from beginning to the present: Native American Indians, who first settled the island, the Spanish conquerers who claimed it, the entrepreneurs who were given Spanish land grants and the developers who modernized it with infrastructure and tourist attractions. We were especially interested to learn about the secret military base which trained specialists to fight in World War II. We were also fascinating by the influence of Hollywood, with so many films made on the island and so many stars, who made it their vacation paradise. Although we had seen a Chihuly exhibit in Miami several years ago, this exhibit included many newer pieces and focused on Sea Forms appropriate to the location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbmegowan
50,Cute Little Place,"We had previously been to the old museum in September 2015, that one was located underneath the Catalina Casino. The old museum was quite small and I remember it lacking air conditioning on the extremely hot day that we visited.Luckily, the new museum was opening a few weeks before we were moving out of California. Catalina Island was one of our favorite parts of LA county, so we went wanted to come over one last time to check out the updated museum in it's new location.The new museum building is absolutely gorgeous! It has all of the modern amenities, but the architecture fits in well with the rest of the buildings around it.If you haven't been to the island, it is breathtaking and you will most likely fall in love with it! Catalina has a very rich and unique history, so I would say it's a must to visit the museum and learn all about this unique destination. If you are a Cubs fan, you will be interested to learn about the history that the island holds with the Wrigley family.The museum won't take you too long to get through, it's safe to budget 90-120 minutes to spend there.The museum just has tons of awesome memorabilia, I highly recommend it. The gift shop has a lot of great trinkets and souvenirs. I especially liked the decorative surfboards that they sell for $29, I picked one up on three of my separate trips to the island. They are colorful and fun to decorate the house with.The museum is about a half mile walk from where the ferry drops you off. There are tons of shops and restaurants within walking distance of the museum.If you have time, I recommend taking the short guided tour of the Catalina Casino.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
50,Exceeded my expectations! A Must-See for First Time Catalina Visitors.,"Our visit to the Catalina Island Museum exceeded my expectations. The museum is bright, modern and well maintained. Plus, you get a free visit on your birthday! (to the general collection only - current exhibits like the Chihuly Exhibit are an extra charge)The museum was a few doors down from our hotel, Catalina Island Inn, and was a perfect introduction to the history of the island. Our group included three adults and one 5-year-old. The museum offers a treasure map scavenger hunt game for children which asks guiding questions as you progress through the museum.We started our visit with the theater where we watched a charming film introduction to the history of the island. Be aware that a few moments of the film may be inappropriate for small children (war, gun use, Marilyn Monroe's affairs and death). These topics were briefly mentioned and mostly went over the 5-year-old's head.The exhibits in the permanent collection offer a glimpse into the fascinating history of the island from it's origin as home to indigenous people, it's military use, it's use as spring training grounds for the chicago cubs to it's heyday as a playground for the Hollywood elite.At the conclusion of our visit, we stopped in the gift shop for some souvenirs and the 5-year-old turned in her completed treasure map. To our surprise, she received a lovely book about Old Ben the sea lion as her reward. She was thrilled.The Catalina Island Museum is a must-see for first time visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140sierran
50,Chihuly exhibit,Enjoyed the information film about Catalina Island and Chihuly. The glass pieces were well displayed and lit. The building is beautiful and airy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHIAMTH
50,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!","We were pleasantly surprised by this place! There were so many things to read and learn that it took us two hours to get through it, but it was so worth it! And we thoroughly enjoyed the Dale Chihuly exhibit. Wonderful artist!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175KimW
50,Chihuly Exhibit was Spectacular,"Just a street over from the Portofino Hotel is the Catalina Island Museum. We were lucky enough to enjoy the Chihuly exhibit, seaform ... all done in sea colors of blues, greens and done in Chihuly's unusual style of glass blowing. The gardens had Chihuly scupltures spread throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to be SO close up to the pieces of artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubajackie
50,Dale Chihuly glass exhibits are stunning,Nice 1-hour activity with video introducing Avalon & history. Dale Chihuly glass exhibits are impressive. They light up the glass on Thursday nights only. Worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tc-AYP
40,Worth a quick visit.,"Nice historical overview of Catalina along with a bit too much stuff unrelated to the island. There's a big admission premium for the blown glass exhibition currently underway, so if that's not your thing then wait until next year. All the same, it's the closest thing to culture the island has.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poochkin
40,"Awesome Museum, but beware, the Chihuly Exhibit is an extra fee","We were really excited to visit this museum, and it has so much neat history about the island and the famous people who visited in times past. I was NOT happy to find out that to see the Chihuly glass exhibit, which is advertised EVERYWHERE in town, was an extra fee. Quite a BIG extra fee. We had passes to get into the museum for free, since those were included in our tour of the Casino. But it would have been another $17/each for us to see the glass exhibit. That's a bit much, in my opinion...we'd already spent a chunk of change on the Casino Tour, and were not told that you couldn't see EVERYTHING in the museum. I HATE being nickled and dimed to death, so we passed on the glass exhibit, on principle, and just looked through the books in the gift shop, which probably had more to see anyways. Oh well...next time they need to just include the entire museum in their fees...or be more clear on the costs and what is included. Several people were dealing with the same issues, and it made it hard on the staff too. Sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7634BClauraw
50,What a wonderful visit,"What a wonderful museum. We first visited the historical section and learned so much about the past years on the island. Then lunch at Bluewater Grill before returning to spend time at the Chihuly exhibit which is a real coup for this museum. We then took the Casino tour, before returning on the Catalina Flyer to Newport Beach. What a perfect day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tk9486
40,Well done tribute to the Wrigley family,"This new museum replaces the old ""hole in the wall"" place at the Casino. I missed the historical memorabilia that used to be displayed with origins other than the Wrigley family, but the Wrigley family has done a lot to preserve and enhance the Island and the museum is well worth a visit. At the moment there is a very good Chiluly exhibit of town glass from his private collection",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahb324
50,Beautiful new museum,"Excellent history of the island, including celebrity visitors over the years; Chihuly exhibit phenomenal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marialc562017
50,History in Perpective,"Aside from visiting the Catalina Island Casino, a visit to this very well manged museum will give visitors to the island a rounded perspective of how the development of this place came about. It has a collection of native artifacts from archeological diggings to photos and videos of the Hollywood stars who frequented the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arrastape
50,"New museum, Chuilly exhibit exquisite.",This was a nice surprise. I got the impression this is relatively new. They have an exhibit about the history of the island including a great section on the Chicago Cubs. Go Cubs Go! I also saw a great Chuilly exhibit. I don't know how long it will be there but it was worth the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovefancyhotels
40,Interesting Museum of Art & History,"Stopped in here and had a nice visit. There are really two museums here. One is a Catalina history museum and the other is a glass art museum. When you go, plan on two different experiences and have two expectations of what you will see.The history side is well done and quite frank about the ""Hollywood"" era on the island. You will enjoy learning about the early Native people who lived here, about the Wrigley family, and about the various challenges of Island living.The art museum is excellent (please no children due to very fragile art pieces!). The blown glass sculptures are stunning and this is a world class collection.The museum staff could use some etiquette lessons at the front desk but the overall experience was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larry-Crystal
50,"Chihuly glass exhibit at the new museum, very enjoyable.","It doesn't take too long to see this exhibit, which I think was very well set-up. Awesome glass, beautifully lighted. The new museum is really nice and close to the main area of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catcindyk
40,"New museum, empasis on Hollywood, price went up.","Taking my Dad to Catalina on his 84th Birthday, and added this new museum as one of the attractions to visit. The entrance fee was previously $7.50, now $17.00, ouch! We did get a break on senior discount to $15.00. It's a good thing kids 15 years and under are free with adult, because they will likely get bored. Not that the museum is boring mind you, with some comprehensive exhibits regarding the connection to the Wrigley owned Chicago Cub's, WWII Military training, and of course ""Old Hollywood"".The foyer is bright and roomy. First go to the small theater to view black and white news reels, with a short documentary of the featured artist Dale Chihuly, who's wondrous glass artwork is currently being displayed here. Then view the well laid out exhibits, with a nice flow with videos playing, mostly reading poster sized text with some actual memorabilia, archeological artifacts, models, photos, etc. (The switchboard display is unique and informative, who knew?)What it was lacking to me; not mentioning the Bison herds, really !! Yes it is still a bit of a mystery as to exactly when and who brought them here. One theory is Zane Grey's 1925 film ""The Vanishing America"". (Yet it contains no scenes of them or even Catalina for that matter). But they have a history on the island to this day that should be told, even if we still call them ""buffalo"". Why no mention of the Union Army garrison that was established at the Isthmus when federal forces seized the Island in 1864? (The building is still standing). The early plan was to make the Island an Indian reservation, that thankfully, was soon dismissed.The previous museum was crammed into a little area in the Casino. (some reviewers actually preferred this one). It's art deco theater and ballroom are briefly mentioned in the news reel movie. I was hoping for more info about its construction, etc. I guess I will need to book that separate tour for another $13.00 to learn more about this iconic structure. Oh well, next visit.The Chihuly glass exhibit is beautifully displayed and easily photographed. (no flash). An elevator takes you to the second level for more of his work. This level is were planned events take place as well. (See website museum calendar). With a few tweaks this place could show a more comprehensive historical overview of the Island.I especially appreciate the fact they have wheelchairs for loan at no charge, for folks with mobility issues for the 1-2 hours you need to fully enjoy this informative environment. Elevator's are actually rare on the Island, oh stairs aplenty. It's inclusion here makes accessibility a welcomed part of this modern addition. (Yes, ADA code might have required it). The gift shop is bright, roomy and well merchandised. A good place to fit into your Catalina visit for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maitaimike2015
50,Excellent Exhibit With Island History,"We happened to visit the museum during the Chihuly Exhibit which was amazing! We were also fortunate enough to attend the ""First Fridays"" event while we were there. There was a wine tasting event which featured 4 of the Rusack's wines. We also played wine bingo which was fun. But the biggest attraction was all of the Dale Chihuly pieces that were on display. They were displayed both inside and outside and they were all throughout the entire museum. His work is absolutely amazing. We had an opportunity to see it during daylight and after dark. It is even more amazing when lighted at night. This exhibit is there until December 2017. In addition, inside the museum there were several static displays of the history of the Island, the Wrigley family, the Chicago Cubs, and several famous people that have visited through the years. I would recommend this experience to anyone visiting the Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottJ156
50,Beautiful space and great resource on the history of Catalina,"We were wandering around Catalina and stopped here on a whim--the space is beautiful, and they had a gorgeous Dale Chuhily glass exhibit going on. The museum is not that large, so it's easy to get through in an hour or two (we spent about 1.5 hours there and saw everything). The first floor provides an interesting history about the island, and part of the first and second floors are dedicated to their special exhibits. The second floor is mostly outdoors and is a beautiful space. I believe they have a lot of events here (First Fridays, evening events, etc.), which we would love to attend another time. They also have a small theater that plays a movie about Catalina's history and their rotating exhibits. All in all, it was a wonderful way to learn about the island in a short amount of time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kagee219
50,Chihuly Sea Forms,My husband and I took the Carnival Cruise to Catalina and Ensenada this past week! What a great find to visit the only Chihuly exhibit in California at the beautiful museum! The museum has only been open about a year. They have a movie that runs on a loop telling the history of the island and its movie making history! The Chihuly exhibit will be there until December. We really had an great time here and as always enjoyed the great works of art created by the glass master!It does cost to get in and they do offer some discounts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol0333
40,Worth a VIsit,Spending an hour or so here is well worth while. Very nice Chihuly exhibit. Provides a very interesting backdrop and history of the island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slstraveler
40,cute,We visited it just for the Chihuly exhibition and it was very nice! The video about artist was very informative and gave good prep to see the art. Small but beautiful collection of pieces was a highlight of our day-at-Catalina stay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinaLACA
50,Small but well done,We were lucky enough to visit the Chihuly exhibit. Beautiful and very well done. The docents are informative and not too stuffy. Loved the news reels and artist feature films.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1860QPmarkf
50,Outstanding museum that tells the tale of the island,"This is a place not to be missed on you stay at Catalina. It is a new museum with an outstanding vignettes of the history of the island. In addition to the history, there are temporary exhibits, and the chihuly glass exhibit was there when I went. This installation was breath- taking with indoor and outside hand blown glass installations. Unbelievable, remarkable, outstanding. Well worth the price of admission, and a great way to spend a couple of hours (although you could probably go through it in an hour). Nice gift shop, too. Beautiful Catalina pottery permanent exhibit, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988claudiab988
50,Recently newly opened. Amazing.,"I always enjoyed the older museum in the Casino ""basement"" , but this in now world-class-- and classy. Really amazing and colorful history of the island... entertaining newreels... this is a must-see. Through December 2017 there's a stunning exhibition of the renowned glass artist Chihuly (that's his work overhead in the Bellagio lobby in Las Vegas.) Make at least one hour for this fantastic museum. You will not regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229jodye
50,"MUST SEE by Dec. 11, 2017","Viewed 5/1/17 11:00am— small museum but well-worth my 90 min visit (15usd for a senior):A GREAT Local Museum in a new location (only about a year) with a wonderful temporary exhibit by Dale Chihuly (Seattle/NW glass artist). This museum used to be located in “The Casino”…it now has it’s own well-deserved building.MUST SEE before 12/11/17 to catch the Chihuly exhibit… the docents are amazingly directive— Go watch the movie, etc. If you listen to them— you will be given a great time and miss nothing.EVEN IF YOU MISS the glass exhibit-- THIS IS A MUST SEE BEFORE, if you are doing a tour of ""THE CASINO""Best to come here before going on a Tour of “The Casino” (40 min. or 70 min— if you can walk stairs, take the 70 min. tour)This museum provides a great historical background on Catalina from the native american past...to the island history of tourism...their two fires...the Hollywood history attendant to the island...displayed well and in a lovely way.This is NOT a museum for any non-english speaking tourists. (I mention this as I spent time recently in Japan and it was nice to find some museums there in two-three languages). This museum clearly ONLY expects English-speaking tourists--my only less than stellar comment about this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittlePrince1977
40,Great museum,Enjoyed the museum visit. Great displays showcasing the history of early film making on the island. I don't think the Chihuly exhibit was worth the extra money and would skip it next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieG4735

40,"On a suprise visit to Avalon, Catalina Island",Well worth the admission. Very nice displays and very informative.

50,Island Must,"We spent our first day just walking around the island and it was great...day two we started with a walk around the museum. It totally changed our view and appreciation of the island and its history!The exhibits are interesting and the layout is great. The guest art was amazing.The staff is very well informed and answered even the quirkiest of questions we could come up with about the island.Your admittance is good for the entire day, so start your day there and then swing back in before they close to fire off a few extra questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daliesik
50,Chihuly Exhibit,We last visited the museum about 7 years ago when it was in the bottom of the Casino. The new location coupled with the current exhibit on display made for a wonderful visit full of information. Well worth the time to investigate!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9876GJdans
40,Two days on Catalina Island,My wife and I saw that the museum was having an exhibit by Dale Chihuly and decided we had to see it. The exhibit was done very well and shows off his talent very well. We have seen his exhibit in the Seattle City Center which is much larger and more extensive but still enjoyed what he did here because he is so creative and does so many different forms of glass art. The rest of the exhibit is also done very well and allows you to get a much better understanding of the history and lure of Catalina Island. We are very please that we spent several hours touring this very well done museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770paulk
50,Fantastic Exhibit,While visiting Catalina we were lucky enough to catch the Chihuly exhibit. The price of the ticket to get in included two short movies that covered the history of the Island as well as the life of the talented artist Chihuly. You walk through the two story museum at your own pace and are greeted by friendly volunteers that are eager to share information with you and answer all your questions. I learned about the history of the island and was privileged to view several beautiful blown glass pieces by Chihuly's team. His unique pieces are worth millions of dollars and are very unique. Don't miss the glass flower garden dedicated to his mother.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MychelleF_12
50,NICE YOUNG MUSEUM HAS EFT ROOM TO GROW,"Only a year old, the Museum has done a great job cataloguing the history of Catalina from the Indians forward. The small collection of artifacts are fascinating. One of my favorite pieces is the old switchboard (would make Lily Tomlin's Ernestine green with envy.) Has to shock millennials who had only known cell phones. One of the most fascinating parts is the video you see prior to going through. The important and SECRET military activities were amazing to learn about and seeing the pre-jet travel heyday of Hollywood's elite making the island their playground makes you wish for a time machine to go back and have a drink with the Duke or meet Norma Jean BEFORE she became ""Marilyn."" Added bonus was the Chihuly exhibit of stunning blown glass. The nested bowls takes your breath away and the outdoor garden borough Willie Wonka to mind for the creative fantasy flowers. And the chandeliers? Beyond amazing! Learning his history in the video included in your tour mode him come alive. An incredible artist. The docents live on Catalina and are very informative plus it is clear they LOVE hat they do. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lektra8462

And in Catalina! What a treat. We heard he was at the museum last weekend.Fixed exhibit is Catalina history. For those not familiar with the Island's history really a must to appreciate.Admission is reasonable $17 adults and $15 seniors. It's a donation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyO267
50,Interesting information about the history of Catalina,"Although entry is a bit expensive (£17, £15 for concessions), this is a lovely museum. The Chihuly glass exhibition (running until December 2017) is worth the price of admission - amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taffbach
50,Small museum worthy of an hour.,"Cost is $17. That's the bad news. The good news is that this is a new museum worthy of a visit for two reasons. One is the history of Catalina is nicely presented. Second, if you like Chihuly glass, this museum has a good exhibit that opened a couple of days ago and will run through the end of 2017. There are two videos presented. The first is about 10 minutes long about the history of Catalina. The second is about Chihuly and his art. They run alternately on a continuous loop. You can see it all in less than two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
50,Chihuly exhibition - a must see!,"I attended the opening day of the Dale Chihuly exhibition on March 25th. To see this exhibit in Catalina was really amazing - a real treat for my husband and me. The glass art is displayed throughout all levels of the museum, from lobby to roof level. This was my first visit to the new museum and I was impressed to see the new building design and exhibit space. The other exhibits that covered Catalina history and the Wrigley family were also interesting. I loved the Native American soapstone artifacts displayed there. The Chihuly exhibit will be there through the end of December 2017, so it's a must see when you visit the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrymanCyn
50,""" A must go island""","Catalina island is one of my favorite getaway island to visit, and is an lovely and romantic spot for couples, group of friends and family.

Even though it's a small space, it is jammed-packed with information and fun facts about the island, including the Chicago Cubs training camp, Wrigley family, clay tile company, tuna club, casino and endless parade of celebrity visitors. A must-see, especially to first-timers on Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneDeLo

20,What a disappointment,"I visited the new Catalina Island Museum yesterday. I was disappointed more than I can express in this short review. Yes, I remember the old museum in the Casino, but this was much, much more than that. This was non a ‘Catalina Island’ museum at all. It is now an art museum with a tiny bit of Catalina Island thrown in. Just what does an exhibit on Art Noveau have to do with Catalina Island? If I want that I have a much better art museum in Milwaukee. Please tell me what is so important that Marilyn Monroe lived there with her first husband that it takes up major space? The ‘old’ museum at the Casino was all Catalina Island history, its wildlife and vegetation. This has virtually none of that and that is why I am giving this low rating. It is not a Catalina Island museum at all, in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flutepilot
40,Where to learn about Catalina's recent past,"This is a very attractive museum that gives a good accounting of the island's recent history, especially since the Wrigley family purchased it in 1919. Perhaps that's no surprise, as the family supports the museum. A short film gives a quick overview, and the exhibits go into more depth that includes a strong Hollywood connection. There's also a room for featured exhibitions that may have little to do with the island, such as the one on Art Deco publishing currently on display.One room is dedicated to Native American artifacts, which seems insufficient. It also would be nice to learn about the island's geological and ecological features, which must be fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bartr
50,Very Educational and Informative,"This building recently opened and it is wonderful. As you wander through the museum, you learn a lot about the island, Mr. Wrigley (of chewing gum fame), celebrities who used to frequent the island and the islands part in World War II.Upstairs is an open air venue suitable for concerts and private parties. The gift shop has interesting items and souvenirs for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayA427
40,"It Won't Take Long, And You Will Be Glad You Stopped","A lovely spacious setting. The first suggestion is to view the short movie about the island.

40,Set your expectations at the right level,"It isn't the Met, but it is interesting to see. There is a permanent collection that takes twenty minutes to view. There are changing exhibitions as well. Next up is the glass artist Chihuly, coming in the spring of 2017. The old travel posters were the most interesting to me. I think it's tasteless to have a significant segment on Natalie Wood's tragic drowning, complete with gossipy speculation as to ""what really happened."" Robert Wagner loved her. She loved him. Alcohol and boats are never a good mix. The end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77

50,Surprising little gem,"Do make the effort to go and find the museum it is tucked up a side street off the main drag but contains lots of interesting history including a short film on Catalina its early founders, an interview with Marilyn Monroes first husband - she lived thereLots of interesting photos of film stars and Winston Churchill amongst othersEntry is very cheap and you can go in and out all day for the One priceHave fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseLock
40,Unexpected Visit to Catalina Island Museum,"We actually had some free time because it was a rainy day. thats right it rained on Catalina!!! The museum was across the street from our hotel so we gave it a shot. Entrance fee is reasonable. We started off with a 15 minute video about the history of Catalina. The video was done in the style of an old time movie newsreel and was fun and informative. We toured the museum exhibitions and found them to be quite interesting. Bonus was an exhibit of local artists. Its not a large museum, but not the price it is entertaining and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomcSSI
50,Great history of Catalina time capsul,"When I was on the Island 3 years ago, they were just building the Museum. Opening this June, it was nice to see the completed project. The displays are very well done and informative. If you are planning any kind of special event- this would be a great location for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eha48rochester
40,Historical Museum/culture,This is a must. There is a 10-15 minute video that explains the historical significance of the island. A playground for the Hollywood stars and spring training for the Chicago Cubs. Great way to learn about the island. The exhibits then tell more stories and explain more history about the Wrigley's and how the island came to be as we see it today. Fascinating. Other exhibits are seasonal. Plan about 2 hours to go through this collection of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanr212
40,Definitely worth your time!,"If you are someone who likes to learn a bit about the places you travel, this new museum is definitely worth your time. It is well laid-out and all of the displays are thoughtfully curated in that there is the right mix of visual interest and text information. And be sure not to miss the art gallery upstairs...there are some very nice pieces. We totally enjoyed the experience. Very nice addition to Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martik2014
40,New Museum is a trove of information,"The new location has a fun movie theater where you start your visit watching little shorts that span the history of the island, from movie star scandals to fires and WWII. It's a great pit stop for those with tired feet or those with sunburns.The galleries have a variety of collections. There are exhibits on the original native population, Wrigley, the Bannings, classic Hollywood, Catalina Pottery, and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewinsomewench
50,Interesting Island History,This museum is highly recommended to visit. It gives a very interesting history of the island and its development. We consider this a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilS1742
50,Dive into History Here,"You begin your journey with a 15 min loop video which lays out the interesting story behind Catalina. This helps you navigate the museum which focuses on the interesting stories and people there. Wrigley, who owns the island is the same guy who made the gum and owned the Cubs. But he attracted the interesting people of the world - imagine Churchill out there fishing. They have special exhibits; we want to go back for Chihuly. It's not a huge place, but what they have is excellent and well curate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseK173
50,Great Museum,Beautiful museum with lots of fun facts about the island. An amazing addition to the island. Loved the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chelseamom73
50,"Modern, ""with-it"" exhibits and amazing gift shop!","A wonderfully designed museum. Great exhibit on the history of Catalina Island, and a BEAUTIFUL photo exhibit of model Betty Page, the gorgeous pinup girl from 1950s. The gift shop is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smccmcd
50,Catalina history comes alive!,"We have been visiting Catalina for years, but had never really learned about the island, its history and the people that shaped the island over the years. On this trip, we visited, for the first time, the Catalina History Museum. It now resides in a new and modern building and provides a well curated collection of artifacts and narrative that takes visitors back over two hundred years.A particularly interesting part of its history is as a playground for celebrities and the islands role during WWII. We spent about 1 hour touring the museum and felt it was well worth out time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6895RZrichardf
50,"New, modern, great display of history","I really enjoyed this small museum. It is a beautiful space and the exhibits highlight the history of building Avalon, the Wrigley's, movies made on Catalina, World War II, indigenous peoples and art displays. Must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzanochka
30,Not Quite What it Should be,A beautiful building but they have abandoned too many of the of the exhibits from the old space in the casino which made it a real history museum. Hopefully more will be added to make it worthy of such a nice space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tk4456
10,Not Pre-Informed of Nudity,"After paying for our family of six, one of our children noticed before we did that nude photos were in the next room.Shocked, mad, and angered, I walked back to advise the front desk that the nude photo exhibit should have been made known to us BEFORE we paid the entry fees.Her answer, there is a red sign on the wall before you go into the room.That red sign was chest high for me and above my child's head. REALLY?!? Guess what else? When I went back to find the sign, my child had found it first, and straight ahead in the line of vision were a set of naked breasts.😳This exposure could have and should have been avoided.My family and I left and will be asking our Visa for a refund because the museum refused.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivPurple
50,A great mini-museum visit,"First, it was a stone's throw from my hotel. Second, it's brand new and really beautiful, even if not quite finished yet. The admission was only $7.50, so it was a great value too. Great staff. The Bettie Page exhibit alone is worth the admission price, but there are other cool exhibits too. This is a wonderful, educational way to spend an afternoon and take in a little island history, Cool gift shop, too. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4105PCchristined
20,Poor representation of the Island,"The new museum is a waste of time and money....... unless you want to see and read all about the Hollywood celebrities who visited the Island in the early days of Avalon's development. There is very little about the prehistoric, original inhabitants, geology, or any other scientific facts about the island. The original (?) museum at the Casino had much more to see in a much smaller space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iknowplants
30,INTERESTING BUT JUST SO-SO,We had been to the island a few times while this was still in the construction phase. The building was looking really big and maybe we just expected too much.It is very nicely done with very nice finishes but once we were done we wished there had been more. I think its the size of the building that threw us off. Almost the whole second level looks like it's great party space so all of the exhibits are pretty much on that first floor.We did really enjoy seeing the history of the island and what it use to look like as well as how and why it has changed hands over the years. I had 2 favorite parts. The first was reading about the fires that had been on the island as well as the pictures. Just amazing and also scary to think about. My second favorite was reading about the communication for the island. So interesting!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
50,First Friday Concert Serries,"For $12 on the first Friday of the month, you can see a live band on the roof, and the museum is open until 9pm. Had a blast, and the local band was great. The museum is well put together, with tons of interesting info on the island. I was sad to not have made it to the theater to see the film.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmjpeach
40,Very interesting,My whole family found out a lot when we visited this museum. The news type video they were showing about the history of Avalon was interesting. I learned alot here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joepress101
50,"Clean, ac and well done.",Good rainy day activity or escape from heat or sun. Recently redone. Has interesting exhibits and easy to tour on your own. Would recommend for tens and older if interested in island history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmthkmth
40,Beautiful Cool New Space,"Gorgeous new space that s bright and sunny and airy. The exhibits could use some development (I mean, what does Bettie Page have to do with Catalina history, besides luring in all the tourists?), and the staff can be a bit pushy, but this place is still worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
50,A must see!,"Loved everything about my visit to the new Catalina Island Museum. The space is beautiful, staff is pleasant, and exhibitions perfectly curated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevinT546
50,"Love, love, love!","I went by myself, then went back with my grandchildren. It's not very large, but has a wealth of information about the island history. Enjoyed seeing the artifacts from early inhabitants and photos from 20th century.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9416DWlindaw
50,"Visit the museum... the new addition is engaging, entertaining and enlightening",Catalina Island Museum's new Ada Blanche Wrigley Schreiner Building opened on June 18. Our first experience in the museum was watching the creation of a sand mandala by Tibetan monks. The monks are amazing. I've attached a photo of two of the monks working.It was fun and enlightening to watch the film clip about the island and walk through the remainder of the building.Our advice is to include the museum in your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmeredith
50,Just visited the Betty Page exhibition!,"This was my first time in the Museum. I was pleasantly surprised. There is a film loop with a quick history of Catalina that is recommended before you walk through the museum. Very clean building, modern. From seeing the different celebrities, the Cubs, tile making history, artifacts from the islands, etc- this is worth the visit. Of course, the highlight was the Betty Page photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keywestelaine
