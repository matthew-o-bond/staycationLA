50,"Great spot to shop, meet and chill",Parking is free outside the main part of the mall so drive around before you end up paying. Really good choice of restaurants and cafes and plenty of seating to relax without feeling the obligation to a buy a coffee you don't need.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wizzey
30,Sunday afternoon visit,"We chose to visit this shopping centre for a day out and a change from the normal. It was ok , nothing special , I was not overly impressed with the selection of shops , generally it was cleanI wouldn't go again unless I was passing .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanessex2018
30,More Westfield,"A giant mall that goes on and on with just about anything chain-like you might want to shop in. Pleasant enough, albeit a massive mall, while having everything, lacks a certain charm, but charm and shopping not necessarily friends. It goes from high end (Neimans) to regular end (Target — what do you call Target shoppers?), and in-between. Lots of food, too, so no worries about going hungry. Shop till you drop kinda spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
40,Just another mall,"This is just another mall, but a nice and clean one. Lots of shops, they seem to have everything there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasasas
20,"So Sad, this mall used to be beautiful and my favorite",The last 5 visits to this mall have been very disappointing.Floors and elevators are dirty.Security needs to be better - people throwing full water bottles off of the 2 nd floor as my family and I are walking by. Not just once but over and over. The concierge watched the whole thing. Security was called and showed up 10 minutes later. Security watched as people drove motorized scooters- very fast - back and forth and all around the mall. They could have seriously hurt someone.After the incident a week ago security really should be better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S4195MBchristineb
50,Keeps getting bigger and bigger!,"Keeps getting bigger and bigger! Oh, I do miss the ice skating rink! Shops get more upscale every time I turn around. Then a Costco was added to balance out the Nordstrom. Food court is amazing, superior food stands. Comparable to the Hawker Stands in Singapore. Amazing. Indoor, outdoor. Parking is often a pain.Still, it’s an amazing place. Plan to spend time wandering, no need to hustle, no telling what you will discover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Delightful Outdoor Mall,"Walked over from Marriott past a dead mall to Westfield Topanga to walk around. It was delightful with stores, and restaurants (from fast food, to casual and more upscale dining). Lots and lots of children activities including shallow water splashing and magnificent climbing playground. Returned for breakfast, shopping and just hanging out. Finished with a visit to the REI. Great place to spend time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenS507
40,Pleasant Outdoor California Shopping,"Never tire of the outdoor shopping experience in California, and this mall delivers it with a nice mix of not every chain store on the planet (that's next door in the air conditioned multi level giant mall), some, of course, but some kiosks, some not known or perhaps local names as well as a few national chains...lots of eateries, a mix of retail types (furniture, hair salon) and restaurant types (fast, casual, fine)...a very pleasant place to walk around. Have been here a few times and this visit found parking to be a bear ... best to stay away from the adjoining Costco side which is crazy busy and full. There's also a shuttle bus that goes between this Westfield Village and its big brother behemoth mall nearby); 2 hrs free parking (3 if you do Costco). Scale is also a plus because it has a more intimate feel than most. Good for kids of all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
40,Interesting Mall,"A nice, updated mall with plenty of shops and restaurants to check out. The nice thing about the mall is its open air, Although it can be very hot during the day, at sunset and night it is very pleasant. Interesting side games for the kids to keep them amused. A great place to people watch all the wanna be beautiful people in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
50,Tons to Do Here,"You'll have plenty fo things to see, do and eat at Westfield. It's really big and it's a great way to spend an afternoon if you're in the area. If you're not in the area, it is worth the drive out because you can make a day out of it with the family. Not only is there plenty of options for shopping, but they have a good line up at the food court. If you get bored, you can cross the street and visit the Village which has more shops and is an open air mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldavid30
50,Pleasant Surprise,"We discovered this gem in the valley by accident and very happy we did. A very easy drive from L.A., Westfield Topanga & the Village is a huge world class mall that was very pleasant on a September Saturday. There are plenty of stores - of all types - great restaurants (lunch at Islands was amazing!), And plenty of free parking, clean restrooms, and friendly staff. Can't wait to return!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain
40,Big and some fancy shops - pretty good for a mall,"Had to kill some time one afternoon, so walked around in this mall. Lots and lots and lots of stores - some pretty high-end ones too. The Tesla dealership was cool and the food court was good. I am not a shopper and would rather go to the dentist instead of the mall, but for a mall this one was pretty good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Customer53140
50,"Very dog-friendly - -and horse-friendly, too!","This outdoor shopping mall has interesting shops and restaurants, welcoming dogs and their owners to walk or window shop. There is even a small, white horse who visits with his owner on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathieH754
50,Very LA,"I stayed at the nearby Hilton in Woodland Hills and spent an evening here and had dinner. I really enjoyed people watching - young couples, senior couples, families. All ages. Wide variety of restaurants with al fresco dining. I did not have time to check out the stores, but it was very nice and within walking distance of the Hilton. My friend does not like to walk, so we took a taxi over. However, it was very difficult to get a cab for our return. Had to have a precise address, and it was hard to find one. Could have walked, but the busy streets deter my friend. We eventually got an address that a taxi would accept. This is the only negative, so beware of this potential issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susiedawson
40,Decent place to stroll,A nice place to stroll with family. And nice place to take a date it seems because I saw romance and lots of hand strolling on Saturday night. Music with live bands most Saturday nights and places to eat and watch a movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momandme2015
50,Something for everyone,"We stayed in Woodland Hills for a month over the New Years. During that time we frequented the mall as it was just walking distance. We used the bus between the Westfield and the Village, we have a 2 year old who loved all the outdoor activity of the Village but also enjoyed the train and children’s activities in the mall. Overall there was shopping and eating options for all of the family and we only managed to make a small dent in our exploration of it all. It was a great mall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FelicityS203
40,Lots of stores and food choices...,"Well, I wouldn't go here on a weekend as it is really crowded. And if you only want to go to Costco, you still have to deal with the parking structure and getting your ticket validated. We enjoyed walking through the Village and seeing the stores, wandering all the way down to the REI at the end. But it's a crowded shopping mall, trendy but crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1439LCmaryv
20,Up Close: Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel,"My sister really wanted to see this exhibit, so I offered to pay. I gave her cash.and they refused her entry. Told her she needed a credit card only. (FYI-online it said they took cash or credit) So she came back to me and got my credit card. She purchased the ticket in person and they charged a surcharge for using a credit card even though it was their fault for not taking cash. A surcharge is only supposed to apply if purchasing tickets online. What a ripoff. She wasn't impressed with the exhibit either. Said it was a total waste of time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/compcrzy
50,Amazing mall,This mall is huge and has just about every store you can imagine. There is a carousel and play area for kids. It is clean and has many varieties of restaurants and food vendors. I highly recommend this mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadTripsNewEngland
40,New addition,"Hate the fact that the old Macy's has closed & all that's left is the one in this mall. However, the new village area is very nice with loads of welcome new restaurants that are just that bit different from the usual USA chains. Nice open air destination but parking looks a nightmare unless you pay $15 to valet!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McAnnie1
40,Westfield Topanga,"We drove up from Irvine to celebrate our twin grandsons' fourth birthday at a nearby venue. We arrived early, and our daughter told us that there was a Barista Society at Westfield Topanga. I have previously reviewed Barista Society as one of the few places in the Los Angeles area that actually is able to prepare espresso properly, so Westfield Topanga became a must visit for a mid-morning breakfast. The iced doughnuts were a nonstarter, but a decent pastry at Pain Quotidien was about 50 feet away, and breakfast was complete with freshly made yoghurt at Go Greek.Comfortable outdoor seating was plentiful, and although acquiring a healthy breakfast was a bit of work, the experience was entirely enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IraG708
50,shopping in LA with lot of different shops,"Really liked this mall as one of the best as it had lot of different shops -also ones that are not too expensive. Check out their website to see the directory.Watch out: it's a little bit hard to find the correct parking as you can get lost and by accident park at the village, thinking you have arrived, but the mall is right in front of the village! Make sure not to miss the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurita9000
40,Modern & Sleek,"Having lived in Asian cities my whole life, an outdoor shopping mall comes as a breath of fresh air. Although the shops here are a little on the pricey side, there are no shortage of food options and cater to most, if not all tastes.My one complaint would be the parking. Unfortunately it costs to park here so we decided to park a short distance from the mall (about a 1 minute walk).But overall a great setting to bring kids or just hang out in a friendly setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndearman10
30,Topanga Village Review,"Topanga shopping is a shopper's dream. With the addition of the Topanga Village, it has added charm to outdoor shopping (boutiques) and restaurants. Love the idea and like the layout. However, it makes no sense to me that there is a fee to park. Across the street at Topanga shopping center, there is plenty of parking with no fee. However, if you go to the Village, you must pay to park, including going to Costco. Therefore my rating of this place is 3 stars instead of 4. Seems like a big rip off and more principle to me than anything else, especially since shopping and eating is a bit on the high side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrisS571
50,Shop till you drop,This is a giant mall with lots of shopping options. The Apple Store is truly the gem of the mall but they've got many other cool stores to spend your hard earned money at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
40,Beautiful shopping center!,"The shopping center is beautiful inside and out, with tons of stores to shop at and dozens of eateries in and around the mall. This mall had a lot of visual appeal; it was ornate and classy. Everything was amazing and clean EXCEPT the one blight on our whole experience was the Target restrooms. They were filthy and disgusting. One stall had a plugged up toilet. The other stalls were bulging and overflowing with used feminine hygiene products. Trash was on the floor around the toilets and the waste receptacle. We told a cashier, but she didn't seem to care. Looked for a manager, but the store was crowded and employees so disorganized that we just walked out. Other than the Target being in utterly unacceptable condition, Westfield Topanga is a great place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyT789
50,Shopping !,"Great shopping and great food ! It's a win win ! All very new and clean nice walking about outside in the ""village "" shopping area and eating Poke ! then go over to the enormous westfields ! You won't be disappointed !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
50,Kylie pop up store and the crazy fans,We came to this mall from 7 hours away to stand in line for the Kylie store. We waited another 7 hours in line to get into the store. The security guards that were working at 3:00 AM were awesome. They explained how the mall and the system ran in regards to going into the store. Molly the general manager had this system down to a science. This was the most organized event I have ever attended. The mall is beautiful and well taken care of. I will definitely be back when I come back to visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lissa1444
50,Shopping or Dining this is the place to go.,This mall has changed with the times. Also bigger & better improvements. Great stores of all types. Great restaurants to eat at.

10,Vandalism and burglary,Hey guys just be careful when you park your car in the car park. Please don't leave anything in the car. I had the window from my car smashed and my bag which had some of my personal belongings stolen. I reported the incident to the police and the mall security. I sure hope they get the perpetrator(S).The experience was traumatic as seeing the glasses of the window all over in the car. Driving back with the car in that condition was very very unpleasant. You feel as though your personal space has been violated and worst still seeing the damage caused.This is one of the many experiences one how it feels when going through vandalism and burglary.I would have never in Westfield Topanga such an incident would happen. Just be careful and always take precautions which includes not leaving any bags in your cars.Best wishes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visitor2153
50,"Westfield Shopping ""The Village' Topanga woodland hills","Westfield Shopping Mall on Topanga in Woodland Hills is a destination place! The mall acquires three long blocks of Heaven! Starting fromVanowen/Victory to Oxnard.Now in between Victory and Erwin is their outdoor mall called ""The Village""...and you won't want to miss that!

40,"Back to school shopping, my kid's favorite mall","We had to do some back to school shopping and my daughter always insists on coming here specifically for the urban outfitters. The vibe is nice here and there are plenty of regular stores mixed with high end stores and restaurants. Oh and there's even a Target here. Plus, this is one of the few inside malls with an Islands (delicious burgers) So if you build up an appetite shopping, this is the place to eat! But what I love most though is that this mall never feels crowded. There's so many different spaces that it's easy to flow from one spot to another. We'll definitely keep coming back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli

50,Very much a Westfield,Visited here whilst staying with family. As I'm from Australia I am very familiar with the Westfield brand and if it wasn't for the different accents and stores it wouldn't be out of place anywhere in Australia. Large enough to keep you occupied for the entire day and there is food galore to keep you satisfied.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guac_and_roll
40,Great mall to spend a day with little kids,"I'm a local so if you're travelling I don't know if this will be a trip destination for you, but if you're in the area especially with young kids and need to eat or need to shop this will be a great destination.I made specific trip with my little ones. It was more of exploring than shopping. I read about their Luckey Climber play area and was very curious. Luckey Climber itself was bit 2 dimensional that a kid can only go up or down leaves not it was not spread out sideways. My 6 YO still had fun except it was too hot and not much shade. I would recommend that you go past 4pm or cooler day. What surprised me is how kid friendly entire mall was. On the village side, which is walk away (or trolley ride away), where Luckey Climber is located, there are also small splash area, rolling ball, and a pond. And surrounding these play area are eatery, coffee shops, snack stores, and many different seating areas to make a kid feel very welcome. But once again it was very sunny day and all the play area lacked shade. So definitely sun screen and come past 4pm so building structures will provide shade. Pond had couple koi or carp. Not sure if you can feed them or not, although there was no sign. Would be nice if there were coin operated fish food for kids. Whole Topanga Village is smoke free and has signage everywhere. I hear parking is not free at the Village but it is free at the mall which is just across the street.Then on the Mall side, there is a carousel and small play area. Play area isn't much but with hot weather my kids enjoyed cooler indoor temperature and it was free. There were 2 rows of counters along the outter wall of this play area where you can eat while watching your kids play. If your kids find free play area to be too boring, you can go right upstairs to Hugs n Giggle which has ball pit and bigger play structures. For the cheapest food if you're traveling in budget, there is a Costco in the Village where you can buy cheap food and grab a seat in Village.Mall had bunch of different stores like a typical mall, but I found that there were lot more food choices that at least I prefer. And Target which makes it one stop shopping for me with my young ones. We came on Sunday and saw that there were plenty of parking especially if you were willing to park further out. It was out family's first time but definitely won't be last. Both kids were knocked out on the way home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBoyA77

Then you can shop at all the great stores and dining options.You have everything you could need- nail and hair salons, vegan food options, frozen yogurt, mexican, Larsen's steakhouse, BBQ, Eureka burgers, Sushi, etc. Lots of options for all price ranges. You can park across the street at the indoor mall. Take the trolley over or walk. You can also park at this shopping area but it has really become busy. Also there is a spa, 24 hour fitness, and yoga studio. If you have kids they have several play areas outside that are just awesome. The kids just have a ball. Have fun, relax, and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12

40,Cozy and comfortable outdoor shopping and dining,"I rarely head to a mall, but was pleasantly surprised with my first visit to the new Topanga Village. We used the center as an easy place to gather family coming from all over and found comfortable spaces to relax while others arrived.The interior areas are surprisingly small, but offer lots of different outdoor environments which tables and comfortable chairs spread throughout. There were many dining options including both indoor and outdoor spaces at most restaurants. The space was very child and dog friendly with play places for the kids and a little green for the four-leg set.Getting to parking was a little of a challenge because of the traffic heading to the Sunday Farmers Market, but once in the garage, there were plenty of spaces and the time to get in and out wasn't bad for a busy pre-Thanksgiving Sunday afternoon. I look forward to heading back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cb4444
