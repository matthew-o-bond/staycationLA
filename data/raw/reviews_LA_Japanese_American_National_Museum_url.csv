50,A slice of History in LA,"If you are coming to Little Tokyo for some shopping and Japanese food, the Museum is A must see.

50,Amazing Historical & Heritage Experience,"Downtown LA has become a cultural treasure of the US with various experiences and world-class museum collections, and the Japanese American National Museum is a treasure often undiscovered by locals and visitors. Don't rush, take the time to slowly walk through and read the enlightening signage with the exhibits. It's a humbling experience, mainly when you read about and see the exhibits of the WWII internment.Before or afterwards, enjoy Little Tokyo, and have a nice meal:).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigh732LosAngeles
50,Thought provoking visit,"The visit to the JANM was thought provoking and highly recommended. If you have interests in the Japanese-American culture, internment camps, WWII contributions, looking for some information on your grand parents, or just have some extra time while visiting Little Tokyo, please drop in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/887erniew
50,"in Little Tokyo, a shockingly interesting exhibit",I did not know that during the second world war Japanese-American communities in West California were detained ad transported to concentration camps in Arizona. These people included second generation people who thought themselves as Americans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piriot
50,Here We Discuss Types of Tax Calculator,"The all circumstances tax depends upon someone's income, types, and the place they are living at. But here we required to reach the basics. If you are finding it too much complicated by Tax Calculator, but knowing about they will always work to your advantage.Some Tax Types• Payroll Tax• The Capital gains taxes• Income Tax• Tax Return Calculator",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taxcalculator
50,Very Well Done Modern Museum,"JAMM has two primary exhibits: one on the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and one on the Japanese experience in the US internment camps following Pearl Harbor. Both exhibits have extensive photographs and narratives. The museum is spacious and should not be missed if you are interested in these topics. It is located in Little Tokyo in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
50,Outstanding Museum With a Lot to See,This is a great museum. A lot of exhibits over several floors. It has some very well put together exhibits that are very visual. It shows the history of a people from many points in time and many locations. This is definitely one of the better museums that I have visited in LA.This is right next door to the MOCA. Also there is a small Japanese American museum across the walk that seems to focus on WWII. I believe it is a separate museum and also worth stoping in to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
40,An Important Story,"I had been receiving the gift shop catalog from the Japanese American National Museum for many years, so when I had the opportunity I had to visit! Much of the museum is dedicated to the internment of Japanese Americans in WWII. There are a lot of artifacts and documents to show what happened to people. It's chilling to see, and once released their property was not returned to them.The other part of the museum has changing exhibits about Japanese and Japanese American culture. I saw Kaiju vs. Heroes, featuring toys and other items from Ultraman. One corner had a screen showed a monster stomping through a city, which was controlled by the motions of the visitor. That was fun to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aquazoo
40,California Tourism,So much history to read and view at this museum. Easy parking and experienced great eateries in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowert125
50,Worth a trip,"My mother and I visited this museum In May which also had a travelling toy exhibit on the first floor (no longer there.) The second floor is devoted to the brutal and sombre history of the Japanese internment camps, thoughtfully presented. Since we had an uncle in one of the camps, it had personal significance for us. Definitely worth a trip if you’re interested in history that is well documented, much of what you’ll never see in American history books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q4687RErobinb
40,Japanese American history with focus on internment camps,This is a very well-laid out museum with various multi-media and artifacts about the four generations of Japanese immigrants to America. There are some early artifacts from various fields of work that the early settlers engaged in and some photos of where they settled and what they did. There is a sense of the hysteria and discrimination that pervades throughout the first section that is seen through newspaper clippings and comics. Then the middle section is focused on World War Two and the internment camps period followed by how the government addressed the issue. It shows the bravery of the soldiers who fought for the U.S. as Japanese Americans. It is a sobering walk though but worth the admission. There is also temporary exhibits but we just missed the toy one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OwenL1688
50,Somber display of what this country was/is capable of,"Don’t expect Sanrio or anime when you come to this Smithsonian affiliate: the Japanese American National Museum is a reminder of the unthinkable discrimination Japanese Americans faced before and during WWII. There were many precious & household items, documents, and photos from America’s concentration camps which imprisoned over 110,000 Americans. There were first and second hand accounts of dissent, patriotism, and perseverance in the face of bigotry and hatred. There was a re-creation of a camp housing to add to the photojournalistic experience, but what will stay in my mind for a long time are the children’s faces peering out of formations led by soldiers and concentration camps surrounded by barbed wires. Yes, Ronald Reagan did sign the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 to superficially apologize for what the US government did, but many others in California, Oregon, and Washington were co-conspirators as well as beneficiaries.Please leave your toddlers at home if you are not willing to control their tantrums - this place deserves decorum to respect the memories of those who lost so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MD_T0urist
50,Wonderful Discussion about Our History,"I attended a very insightful discussion about the Japanese incarceration that took place at the start of World War II and the parallels that we're seeing at the US Border today. The Museum has been outspoken about the idea that these abuses of basic human dignity should ""never happen again"" when we saw the backlash against Muslims recur a few years ago, and now with the reports of children being separated from parents and held in horrendous conditions by our government.The engagement and involvement of the people attending was encouraging, but the message that Americans should never forget mistakes made by our country in the past resounds through the walls of this museum.It's a very worthwhile museum for its special events like the discussion with George Takei that I attended as well as all the usual exhibits and programs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,Dignified museum that keeps important memories alive,"The museum is dedicated to the Japanese American community, documenting their challenges and difficulties, but also celebrating their resilience. Nearby streets and alleys are fun to visit after visiting the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elgueroranchero
50,An important part of history,"This museum does a great job of telling the story of the Japanese immigrants, especially the tragedy of the WWII interment, including an internment center shack housing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
20,I should have read the reviews,"This is not a museum with Japanese art. This is not a museum with Japanese American art. This is not a museum with any art.This collection does an excellent job at retelling the history of Japanese internment during world war II. It correctly names The architects of the internment and who was responsible for what. It has pieces of one of the original internment shacks rebuilt in part. A few audio visual displays. Some suitcases, tableware and other sundry items, as well as honorable stories of Japanese-Americans who served in the US army. There was a lot of pain in this display. Beautifully done, thoroughly told.My mistake was that I thought I was going to see Japanese art. There are no Japanese art collections unlike some descriptions. It was 100% about Japanese internment. My son was very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyMan1963
50,Unforgettable history.,"Please stop by here before you go to Little Tokyo.The Metro station is very close.I believe that there are a lot of Uber or Lyft drivers nearby.The admission is $12.It is bit high.But I think it is worth while paying $12.Many non-Japanese may not know history of Japanese Americans.Especially, their sadness at the relocation camps.Many Japanese Americans proved their patriotism to the United States.The building is beautiful.There are small Japanese gardens.You will love it.Nowadays, Little Tokyo became very popular sightseeing spot.But there were many hardworking Japanese lived in the area.Please learn history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkT4358
50,Great history lesson,The museum did an excellent job showing how the Japanese Americans were treated. It was very sad to read all the family stories experienced in various camps. One can't forget what happened to not only Japanese Americans but to other ethnic groups that were singled out in other ways like the Chinese. The museum also had other galleries highlighting artists. A must see museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860elaineg
50,Really interesting,"I have been there several times. My husband's family is Japanese and I look hearing them share the stores of their past and ancestors while we tour the exhibits. There are always traveling exhibits, so each visit is different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJK456
50,Great and important museum,"This museum does a great job telling the story of the Japanese American experience in the US - they also have a couple of special exhibition spaces, which offer exhibitions that may be related to the JA experience in some way. It is a beautiful building, and worth a visit if you are in DTLA. Little Tokyo is not far from Downtown - we walked from Grand Central Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImekaSF
40,The story of Japanese-Americans in the US,"I hit is right on family day, Sunday, Nov. 10 and it was free. The exterior of the building is interesting. There was an historical exhibit about the assimilation of Japanese immigrants into the United States .I loved the small Japanese garden area and a very interesting gift shop. There was also an interesting Japanese toy exhibit the the children would find interesting. Normal admission is $12 per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel92630

Whether you're Hapa or not, go on a Saturday, take a polaroid and contribute a personal reflection on your identity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDPfjl0702
40,Free on the third Thursday of the month,"We scheduled our sightseeing to take advantage of many free offers and found ourselves at this museum on the third Thursday of September. This museum has informative displays about the Japanese in America and provides at some length facts about the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps during World War II. There is even an exhibit of a barracks where they lived while interned. While we were visiting, there was an exhibit called Kaiju vs. Heroes, Mark Nagata's Journey through the World of Japanese Toys. If Japanese toys are your thing, visit now through March, 2019.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joan632015
40,April 2016,This is a nice museum in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles. While it isn't very large it covers the experience of the ethnic group when it came to America. The admission price is inexpensive and even has a Metro discount. There is a large reconstruction of the housing used during the Internment and personal stories of the people involved. Shows we have some growing to do. I would recommend it for anyone that wants to know more of the groups that made Los Angeles and the US.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933reeds

Great for Family and Friends to have a great time and a few steps from Lil Tokyo to get some great food!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gunbuster4life
50,A Shared History!,"This is a must see for all of us interested in CA history. I enjoyed seeing all the ways Japanese culture, traditions, and hard work have contributed to our shared CA and national experience. The permanent exhibit reminded me of the long standing and rich contributions the Japanese have made to America. Besides enlightening me about the long and fruitful Japanese history in America it also reminded me of the shame our nation committed during WW2 when citizens, and the newly arrived were deprived of their constitutional rights and sent to concentration camps; their lives disrupted forever. We must respect the dignity, rights, and contributions to our nation of all peoples, citizen and immigrant alike. I was enlightened and shamed at the same time, but left with a greater appreciation and understanding of history and the need to understand and respect all the people in our common republic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1dudley
50,Very important for us to remember,"I first visited a couple of years ago when an exhibit of 'camp life' in the WWII internment camps of California was organized. I was born in Ventura in 1946 and went to school in a rural area. Several of my classmates' parents and grandparents had been interned. There were also the children of veterans of the Japanese-American group of enlistees who volunteered to serve during WWII while their family remained behind wire stockades. I've visited since including a beautiful exhibit of large sculptural pieces of origami (although i guess all origami is sculptural). Regardless of the exhibit, this Museum is a really great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneL337
50,The Past is Prologue,"Everyone should take a trip to the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, especially now owing to our government's current stance on immigration. One of the exhibits highlights the trials and successes of Japanese Americans during their disastrous and unconscionable imprisonment, without due process, during WWII. The writings, reasoning and litigation handed down then by the local and Federal governments to a vulnerable population of American citizens and recent immigrants is chillingly similar to current rhetoric and the actions of our elected officials today. Particularly sobering; the collected military honors, including a CMH, donated by the families of Japanese American patriots who volunteered to fight overseas WHILE their families were being held in detention centers. While good men and women fought to save civilization, others saw an opportunity to cash in on institutionalized racism for a big land and property grab. Check it out, you need to know how courageous the people were in the face of losing everything, some even their lives in the service of their country after it turned on them. This all being said, there are many other things to see at this museum and lots of uplifting, beautiful and enlightening stories to be told to attendees reflecting the lives, loves and triumphs of the Japanese American community in Los Angeles and elsewhere. This is a well maintained museum, obviously beloved of the local residents who volunteer to operate it. Well worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveR4626
40,Important Message; Very Well Done,"Very good museum with an important lesson for all Americans. More so, there was an exhibit in the special gallery about the Muslim experience in America that was very good and thought-provoking as well. Well-done all around, and worth a few hours of your time if you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMDG8R

40,The history of Japanese Americans on the west coast of the U.S.,"This museum shows the history of Japanese immigrants on the west coast.It showed how by their hard work and cooperative actions they prospered in this new country. This did not go well with some Americans who created a backlash in taking away some of their rights, like owning property.The war fueled the backlash and unrealistic controls were established, forcing them to leave their businesses and their homes and go to camps. The reality of seeing an example of the camp and pictures of a site show how barbaric the actions were.The history portrayed in this museum showed how easily people can be targeted and how we need to speak up and not allow this to happen again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margi102014

50,Excellent museum,"A great place to learn about the struggles of the Japanese migrants to the US, particularly the shame of their internment during the Second World War. Excellent treatment of the Nisei of the 42nd Regimental Combat Team (and many of their families) who, despite the unjust treatment of their families, fought with valour and distinction for the US during that war. Also a wonderful exhibition called Hapa.me, an artistic project looking at those who identify as 'hapa' - mixed Asian/Pacific ancestry, and a photographic exhibition Portraits of Courage, black and white photographs of surviving Nisei veterans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie

50,Thought Provoking,"We knew that Japanese residents of the US, some American citizens as well, were descriminated against after the US declared on Japan. Here you learn the story of the Japanese who migrated to the US looking for work, their struggles to bring their families to accompany them, and the unfair treatment they endured when they were ushered into the US version of concentration camps. In spite of the injustice, American citizens of Japanese descent eagerly joined the armed forces when allowed to do so, serving valiantly to preserve the freedom taken away from them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THFinPR

Admission is $12 per adult, discounts for seniors and students. The museum focused on Japanese immigration to the US and Japanese American internment during WWII. The exhibit was done very well with photos, personal stories and recollections. There was a special exhibit featuring photos and essays of mixed race persons called “Hapa”. Other than that there was not much else. There is a cafe and tea room and a gift store with nice things. Enjoyed the visit, just thought there would be more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pasherry
50,An Impressive and Educational Museum Of Japanese American Internment,"A large modern and looming structure with permanent and traveling exhibitions. ""Contested Histories: Art and Artifacts from the Allen Hendershott Eaton Collection"" was on exhibit during our visit. These handmade objects from the Internment were the focus of an auction which was stopped by Japanese American community leaders and FB activists.This is a wonderful place for students to learn about the history of Japanese American Internment camps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flsouri
40,An important educational experience,"We recently checked out the Japanese American National Museum after seeing the musical Allegiance featuring George Takei. The museum stands as a testament to the history of Japanese-Americans. On display are artifacts, photos and commentaries about Japanese and Japanese-American culture in the US, their socio-economic achievements and most important of all, their painful experience in internment camps during WWI. Bring your students, children and friends to learn about a part of American history that is not always taught in school. It's a great learning experience! When done, step across the street to the Japanese Village for some great food, shopping and sight seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dod2015

The exhibit is very well displayed, and there is an annex across the walkway that is also part of the museum. It is a nice way to spend a few hours, in downtown. Parking lot in back of the museum, and is one of the cheaper parking lots in Little Tokyo, and the museum is $12/adults. There are also many cool shops, and restaurants in this area, so spend a few hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt

Interesting artefacts and photos. Worth every penny.On the ground floor there is art exhibitions by Japanese artists.. one was of hanging cherry blossom. So beautiful and authentic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieQ937
50,"Sadness for yesterday, a warning for today","Really nice facility, with additional exhibit and large classroom areas across the plaza. Includes a calming flowing water installation for meditation and chilling out. Fine permanent and visiting exhibits, although not particularly engaging for the viewer. Exhibits are well labelled, and there are some video commentaries available. The strongest theme of the permanent exhibit seems to be the Japanese American internment during World War II. Highlight for me was the showing of the Konrad Aderer documentary, ""Resistance at Tule Lake,"" discussing the brutal treatment of thousands of American-born, U.S. citizens, incarcerated at the Tule Lake Segregation Center. Many were forced to renounce their U.S. citizenship, and some were deported to Japan, a country that they had never known. This was particularly relevant, given the political climate of today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223

50,my father's dream come true!,"Whenever I am in LA, I always try to fit in a stop at this very beautiful and very important museum. For some background, my father was sent to an internment camp during World War 2. His only crime was that he was born of Japanese ancestry. He received no due process but spent about 4 of his formative years there. Fast forward a few decades to the Redress hearings, where former internees or their descendants called for compensation of those unlawfully interned. Surprisingly, my father did not want compensation himself, but wanted a museum which would tell the story as a reminder to future generations. Well, this is that museum. Its main focus is to document Japanese American history, with a focus on the internment experience, but the museum curators also bring in other exhibits that tell similar stories of social injustice and inequality based on race or ethnic origin. This last visit focused on the stories of Japanese who immigrated to South America. Past exhibits have show cased the multi ethnic neighborhood of Boyle Heights (Jewish, Japanese, Latino, African American communities) and the diversity of Hawaii as seen through Hawaiian plate lunch. The staff are helpful and cheerful. They help Japanese Americans trace their roots. Some of the volunteers were interned at the camps themselves, and will often share their stories, if you ask. The museum shop has many one of a kind souvenirs and books. The space itself is gorgeous. If you are in the area, it is well worth a stop. It is just a few yards away from the Little Tokyo stop on the LA Metro Gold Line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mt188
50,Even if you are not Asian American you will be impressed at this story of American mistreatment of Japanese Americans,"The main part of this museum deals with the relocation during WWII of thousands of AMERICAN CITIZENS to internment concentration camps in the United States because they were of Japanese descent. You will be amazed at the exhibits - the construction of the camps, the way people were herded like animals into rail cars to places in Arkansas and Wyoming to name a few. Possessions were sold for pennies on the dollar because so little time was given to pack your belongings to leave your home. Leaves you wondering if this could happen again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293pats

I was most excited to see the exhibit Transpacific Borderlands which is one of many exhibits around town at various museums that is part of Pacific Standard Time, the celebration of Latin America in (and around) Los Angeles. It did not disappoint. You'll see many fabulous works by Japanese Artists living in Latin America or living in Latin areas of So CA. Obviously the permanent collection here tells the history of Japanese communities in the USA and details a lot about World War II. Excellent presentation and details history none of us can or should forget.The museum was freezing when I was there. Bring a sweater. You'll thank me if you remember this tip.

She has been a volunteer at the Museum for many years, and her personal commentary added a great deal to my understanding of the history of the Japanese community in the United States. I thought I knew a fair amount about the internments during World War II, but the many exhibits (along with my friend's explanations) made me realize how little I really knew.

40,"A nice, small museum with focused exhibits","I enjoyed my short visit to the JANM, mostly to see the new George Takei exhibit (his personal collection of memorabilia). The overall theme, however, focused on the internment of Japanese during WWII and their treatment by the US Government. A good bit of the 2nd floor is all about the internment and, in that respect, it reminded me of the lower-level exhibit of slavery history at the African-American museum in DC...it's rather depressing. What's missing at the JANM is balance regarding why the US Govt did what it did: That's not to justify such treatment but it's always easy with 20/20 hindsight to fully criticize a decision in retrospect rather than damn it in context. Still, I don't think many Americans, especially those from back East, are particularly familiar with this sorry history so I'm glad it's covered. George Takei's exhibit also highlighted his musical Allegiance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLVAGUY

The primary exhibits were about life before and during World War II as we remember 75 years since the declaration of internment or concentration camps for our Japanese-American Citizens. They showed the community as it existed, the increasing racial tension they faced, the terrible decision to relocate to Internment camps, life in the camps, and responses taken by our American citizens of Japanese descent.

For many, this event was only glossed over in school, and students today are far removed from this. This permanent display was well done and very educational. The other exhibit was George Takei with lots of Star Trek memorabilia. This is a wonderful chance to show your children what prejudice looked like during the war.

40,"Powerful story, interesting displays","The museum tells the story of Japanese immigration to California and understandably focuses most of the permanent exhibition to the Internment during World War II.

50,Education in Few Words,"Situated across the street from a charming pedestrian-friendly plaza known as Little Tokyo, the Japanese American National Museum's main attraction is its exhibition of pictures and other memorabilia from the concentration camps along highway 395 to which Japanese-American residents were subject in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Surely, as the name implies, the museum's content covers wider ground than just those atrocities, exploring all the facets, influences, and effects of the Japanese-American immigrant community, and Japan-US relations. However, if visitors heed the stories deeply, they'll leave the museum with questions concerning freedom and morality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505jasona
40,Nice Small Museum,"Good museum for learning about Japanese American history. Lots of information about the WWII internment experience including a living quarters building.

50,Go for broke!,"Every American should visit this collection of essential, but not necessarily well known, American history. As an American too young for WWII, who grew up in New England, the history of Japanese-Americans was late in arriving. Perhaps older Americans were too embarrassed by their our conduct/attitudes toward them to tell us. And so moving when, as an adult, I realized how essential they were to California and the west, how badly they were treated, and how proud we should be to have them in our midst. The museum traces their history from immigration thru backbreaking hard work, success in business and farming despite discrimination, wartime relocation and incarceration, proof of loyalty thru heroism in WWII combat and return overcoming all negatives.They were the true Greatest Generation. Their story is uplifting. The rest of us need to know about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO
50,Moving and inspirational museum,"We visited the museum with a group of friends and we arranged for a private docent tour. I was so impressed with our docent's knowledge, and learned a great deal about the Japanese immigrants who came to Los Angeles in particular.

There are many Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood of the museum, so you can make a day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisecE2410TH
50,Book a guided tour; the docents are AWESOME!,"Every year that I teach WWII to World History 10th graders, I bring my students to the Japanese American National Museum; this means I've been coming here for over 10 years. Each year, I learn something new and am impressed with the time and care the docents give to my students. Many of the docents were either interned themselves as youngsters, or had relatives that were. They encourage my students to ask questions and take the time to explain the different parts of the museum. The JANM is a small museum and we're usually done in about an hour. If you're lucky enough to go with a school group, you can sign up for origami and Taiko drumming, which are both a lot of fun for the kids. I highly recommend this gem! When you're done, don't miss the gift shop, and make sure to walk around Little Tokyo too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachertraveller17

50,Worth the visit,"A beautiful museum in Downtown Los Angeles. It tells the story of Japanese Americans in the U.S. If you aren't Asian, or not from the west coast, you might not be aware of what this group had to go through in the fairly recent past. The permanent exhibit about the ""relocation"" camps was very well presented. I believe this story about how one ethnic group had to experience in the 20th century needs to be told to all, but especially to children, so that it isn't even under consideration in the present or future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriam450
50,If you're Asian American you must visit!.,"You know this country wasn't always great. Having museums like this remind us of the past. To move on but never forget, never repeat history.

50,The Museum and Tea,"If you want a quick Museum experience,yet meaningful in understanding a cornerstone of California culture, this is the trip to take. The Japanese influence in California is not as evident as it used to be. Japanese markets, stylized landscaping, and authentic restaurants have been replaced by commercial trends. This museum allows you to have a look at aspects of the Japanese in both Los Angeles and California. Right around the corner is Chados for a nice Tea experience and Little Tokyo offers many restaurants and shops. It is a nice day trip. You can even take the Metro line to get there. If you are there in early August, you can experience the Tanabata Festival -- my favorite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureQn
50,Unique museum and you'll learn something along the way.,"This museum is unique in that it shows people some of the history of life in camps that the Japanese Americans were interned in during the war. I don't think most people know how the camps were set up. These weren't summer camps. They were crude and not even fit for animals. Along with this history, there is art as well.

50,History of Struggles and Accomplishments of J-A Viewed Here,"The JANM has the best depiction of the history of the Japanese Americans in this great country of ours. Very little is publicized about their contributions, struggles and accomplishments. It is all here in a compact and moving manner. It is an eye opener for the uniformed. DId you know that the most decorated combat unit in the long, history of our country ws composed of 100% Japanese-Americans or that 127,000 west coast J-A citizens were singled out due to prejudice and put into concentration camps during WW2? This and many other stories unknown to many fellow Americans can be discover by a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohgeorge
40,Cool place with interesting exhibits,"I really like this place. It's not too big, so it's great for an afternoon. They have interesting touring exhibitions like Noguchi, Hello Kitty, etc. as well as events in the evenings such as readings and social activities.

40,Japanese Exhibitions,I took a group of students from Japan to see the Japanese American National Museum. They were fascinated by the women's exhibit and the handmade items. American students respond in a similar manner. The postcards are always moving. I recommend visiting often. Items in the gift store change frequently and help support the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300carenr
40,Great LA spot downtown,"You can't really miss on Japanese food here, and the live music on the weekends is surprisingly good, or may be not because this is LA. Fun vibe, many people dressed for Harjuku who aren't even Asian:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niceguysf99
50,A must see to learn some important history,"I happened to visit the museum almost by accident, was curious to see their gift shop (I am always interested in Japanese books), and discovered a very good museum. They have interesting exhibits throughout the year, but the most important one, in my opinion, is the one about the dark history of the concentration camps where Japanese Americans were interned during the 2nd WW. A real disgrace in the history of the Country, which people should be made aware of, so that we can learn from past mistakes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60stefano60

50,Excellent for Japanese-American but also Wider Attractions.,"We took our grandson there to introduce a little family background legacy, my wife being a sansei born in Chicago to parents who met and married while interned in Poston, Arizona. So the artifacts and experiences have some direct relevance to us, and that part of the museum was top notch in that regard. The staff is excellent as well.But the museum also houses much more. We also saw a great giant origami exhibit,with very large paper based sculptures. Also there was an exhibition on tattooing by Pacific Islander artists which have nothing to do with Japanese culture per se.We also ran into a promotional exhibit for a film, Kubo, which uses a lot of Japanese paper doll technology which was very culturally attuned to the Japanese Ohon festival.My wife decided to become senior sponsors and plan to visit from time to time from San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liarsnf

40,Great Japanese Museum,"The Japanese National Museum was good to visit and located right in downtown LA in Japan Town. I'd plan on for about less than two hour visit. It consists of two floors and is an exhibit of the history of Japanese people in the U.S. including the information regarding Japanese immigration to the states and the internment camps during the war.

We learned a lot about the injustice experienced by our ancestors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5226TQjulieh
50,Private Event Venue,We visited the museum when it was used as a venue for a private dinner event. The museum exhibits provided an interesting dimension and augmentation to the dinner event.

There was a visiting exhibit that featured tattoo body art that was quite fascinating and well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshPhD

With displays that are carefully considered and highly informative, a luxurious space to in which to take in this history as well as other current Japanese artist displays, and an area where you can learn origami folding, this space is really well played out.

40,Feel like your in Tokyo!,"The Japanese American National Museum is not only a great museum but in a location that I never knew existed in Los Angeles! (I'm a 2nd generation native!). So, before going know that besides the museum, you'll want to spend time walking around the neighborhood - possibly having lunch or tea. I actually brought my 4 year old granddaughter to a special exhibit and I would have spent more time if I was alone! The museum has changing exhibits so you may want to make sure that you are going to enjoy the exhibit. One of the things that I really enjoyed was seeing things about the Japanese in Los Angeles (especially) pre WWII. My mother grew up in East LA (Boyle Heights) which was a true melting pot at that time. So many things reflected what my mother had told me about her Japanese friends during that time. Two things to note - don't miss the gift shop! From books to all kinds of gifts I probably could have done all of my holiday shopping there! The other thing is that parking isn't great. There is a lot that validates if you buy something or eat in the area (but not at the museum). It was definitely worth it. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars was the lack of parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I7353QWjaneb

40,Tea Room is FANTASTIC,"I needed a location for a board meeting and arranged for one at the Japanese American National Museum. We had lunch for 30 at the tea room and it was amazing. The food just kept coming and it was delicious and very fresh. The variety of teas they served was sensational. We started with a lovely fresh salad, then tomato basil soup that was yummy, followed by a three tier server with delectable little sandwiches, scones with clotted cream, and more. The servers were fast and very personable. I had a hard time getting the ladies to leave the tables to go to the board meeting.I was very pleased with the facility and that staff was lovely to work with. The gift shop is excellent.

50,Small but mighty,"This smallish museum is in downtown Los Angeles, very near Union Station, in area called Little Tokyo. While there are several exhibits, the main is the relocation or internment centers from World War II era. It shows the deportment, imprisonment and attempts for regular life of 100,000+ Japanese Americans, most of whom were American citizens. Artifacts are simple, photographs outstanding [some by famous American photogs], and overall very moving. The relocatees are fewer and fewer due to age, so our younger generations need to see this impressive collection, so this history doesn't repeat itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryeeMH

50,A fascinating trip through Japanese American history,"The museum traces the history of Japanese Americans from the first arrivals in Hawaii and the rest of The United States, through the internment during WWII and subsequent events, up to the present. The displays were very enlightening, though sad when considered in light of the abominable treatment the Japanese Americans suffered. Their history is one with which every American should be familiar and is particularly relevant given recent events and rhetoric.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfred33235
30,Small but interesting,"I went several years ago and there was a great exhibit about the shameful racism against Japanese in California and the internment camps. There was also a really interesting exhibit about how gardening used to be on of the main jobs of Japanese immigrants, but the invention of the leaf blower dropped the income potential and the entire business shifted to Mexican immigrants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390

30,I went for the Hello Kitty exhibit...,"The Hello Kitty exhibit was fun - and for my 7 year old niece, it was perfect. The price to buy a membership was low enough that I got convinced to buy a membership. Unfortunately, the rest of the museum was not as vibrant as the show. It is a nicely manicured museum, but I did not find the content to be so compelling. Saying that, if there is an interesting exhibition, this is a fine place to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dklany

Allen Say spoke about his life and his latest book The Inker's Shadow, which is a continuation of his own story that began with Drawing From Memory. At the same time, there were free activities all day for families including music and art projects.

The permanent exhibits take you back to a time where the Japanese living in the US didn't have much and were treated poorly. But they made the most of what they had and tried to put a positive spin on their condition. I like that they change their exhibits periodically so that it keeps me coming back. The staff is friendly and museum grounds are clean.They always have exhibits changing all the time. Their website keeps you up with them, giving you a timeline of what exhibits are currently on display as well as past and future ones to come.There is a calendar of events full of activities for familes and art lovers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFonger

Also, since it was festival week, they had lots of crafts for young children to do. They let the kids try out the taiko drums. It was also free day at the museum. A very nice place to learn about Japanese American culture. However, I would only bring my 4 year old when they have the special children's events, the rest of the museum didn't interest him.

50,What Every American Should Know!,"The Japanese American Museum is in downtown Los Angeles at`100 North Central Ave.The telephone # is 213-625-0414.This museum is in Little Tokyo. We parked our car across from Universal Studios and took the subway to the end of the line which is the Train Station. The Museum is 3 blocks from the station. The architecture on the building is beautiful. The Cost per Senior is $5.00 per person. They give you an ipod for the second floor exhibit and it was wonderful. It took us over 2 hours to go through the exhibit on the internment of the Japanese during WWII after Pearl Habour It shows you how the Japanese Community was very vital before the war including in community activities like the boy & girl scouts and teams for baseball and football. Everything was taken away from them during the War. Many of us do not learn about this in school, so I suggest everyone should go at least once. We went to lunch at their Tea Room called Chado. The have many choices of salads and sandwiches at a moderate price. Very nice décor as well. It is close to the Grand Central Market and that is an experience in itself. The subway is 1/2 block away from the market, so it was easy to catch to go back to our car at Universal. What a wonderful adventure! Try it, you will like it!Ricki Bergman, Travel Consultant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIB1128
50,Gem in Little Tokyo,"As an Angeleno I had not been to Little Tokyo in several years and was so impressed with the area and most specifically with the museum. It is a beautifully designed building with first rate exhibitions that offers people of all backgrounds important information of life for the Japanese American, especially during WWII.Our main interest in visiting was the superb exhibition of a Japanese-American soldier who took secret photos during the war. The now 96 year-old Susumu ""Sus"" Ito was part of the segregated Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the most decorated unit in U.S. military history. I only hope the museum will make this a permanent exhibition for all to experience, especially the younger generation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZZMimi
50,Glad I Went,"This is a great museum to learn about the Japanese Americans during WWII. Very informative and thought provoking. This is about a half day activity. Wear walking shoes, and take the time to look at all the exhibits and read the descriptions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyg554
40,Interesting visit through time.,"While attending a private fundraising event, I had the opportunity to tour the museum at night with no crowds. I was able to read and enjoy each display and gain more understanding of the history of many Japanese Americans. Very informative and gave me a different persecutive of the struggles of Japanese Americans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonlight
50,Make this part of your Little Tokyo experience,"I have been there several times. If you want to know about the Japanese American Internment Camps, this is the place to go. They have very informative exhibits. I have also been to a special Hello Kitty exhibition there which was so much fun. Also, there are so many great restaurants nearby. Definitely include this museum as part of your excursion to Little Tokyo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovehawaii88
40,Very Informative; One of a Kind,"Very informative about the Japanese-American experience in the United States from immigration, WWII internment, etc. At one time, they had a scaled layout of the Relocation Camp in Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Very well done; much more complete than the ""national monument"" @ Heart Mountain, Wyoming. The information covers a broad spectrum of topics; saw the 911 exhibit there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kumonski
50,Very interesting photo exhibit drew us there,"It was called ""Before they were heroes"" & was extremely well done. There was a nice introductory film with comfortable seating. Many of the photos were hands on. They were mounted on lightweight boards & you could pick them off the shelf & read the description on the back. Others were behind glass. The rest of the museum was also very interesting & definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenl706
40,Interesting Museum,"This small but interesting museum is well worth your visit.It is a central part ""lLittle Tokyo"",A few shops,some ethnicrestaurants and you are done.THe museum,however,has several interesting exhibits.My favorite is the one dealing with the 'camps' Japanesewere sent to during WWII.It is a well documented andexecuted exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lira77
50,Beautiful Museum,The Japanese American Museum was a great experience. I was fortunate to see the Hello Kitty Exhibit and was very impressed with the detail and enormous collection. The architecture of the building is gorgeous. Just a beautiful museum overall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293davidab
40,Good to know some of hidden dark US history,"It is a good museum to visit; you will discover why Japanese came to the West, how they lived/worked, how they were treated during WW2 (deportation, concentration camps), how the U.S. Apologized, etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/485md
50,Lots to do in Little Tokyo,"This museum, adjacent to Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles, is a wealth of information on the role of Japanese Americans in Los Angeles and beyond. The WWII detention camp exhibits are especially moving and make you feel as if you are going through the same experience that thousands did in the 1940's. There are very knowledgeable docents who are available to lead you on private or group tours. The gift shop is also a fun place to peruse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013
50,Took Mom to Visit,"I love this museum, so I'm biased. The regular exhibit of the Japanese Americans interned in concentration camps during World War II is very interesting. My mother was interned during the war as a six-year-old, so it's moving to me now that I have a six-year-old of my own. I like to visit when I have some time downtown, so I became a member this year. The time that I took my mother in April was the last weekend of the ""Hello Kitty"" exhibit, which was really interesting - lots of school kids in attendance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
40,Hello Kitty at Japanese American Museum,"Interesting Museum. If you are a Hello Kitty Fan, you will enjoy the exhibit. The gift shop has reasonably priced items. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marjorief829
40,LA's Japanese American National Museum - a Must-see,"This is an unique Los Angeles historic and cultural experience. Very much a part of the Little Tokyo community in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA), the Japanese American National Museum is an important window into the Japanese American community both here and beyond. Captivating exhibitions are both scholarly and entertaining. And the museum shop has terrific finds. It is an LA treasure. Olga",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399olgag
40,A new adventure,I grew up in Los Angeles but just recently went this museum. I enjoyed this museum. the first time I went it was just to see what was showing. the second time I went they had the hello kitty exhibit which was very good and interesting. I plan to go whenever they have new exhibits,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dqueen1
30,I went for Hello Kitty Exhibit but the museum itself was nice but small.,Small but interesting. Depends on what you are looking for. Nice little tea house/restaurant attached to the museum.

40,Beautifully done,"We visited in the past, but because the weather was horrible, we wanted to see our daughter's ""tile"" again. :) We were there on the last day of the Hello Kitty exhibit - very crowded and many children running around. It was difficult to enjoy/take in the ""real"" museum with so much noise, but we were able to see the a lot. It tore at my heart to see what my ancestors went through. Although they were in Hawaii at the time, I have heard stories of what they went through and saw much of it up close on this tour. Unfortunately, because the 442nd museum is not part of the JANM, we were unable to locate my uncle's name on the monument because the 442 booth was closed.Our annual membership is well worth the cost and we will definitely return soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHO1978
40,Hello Kitty,"A group of friends and I visited this museum for a docent-led tour of the permanent exhibit on the WWII Japanese internment camps. As a side, the visiting exhibit was Hello Kitty which is celebrating it's 50th or 60th anniversary. I think I am the only person in the world that didn't know about this sensation. I enjoyed reading the originator's philosophy around creating Hello Kitty. There were thousands of branded items on display from its very beginning through today. There also clothes worn by celebrities with the Hello Kitty theme as well as original artwork. After a lunch at Chado Tea House, we met our docent and toured the permanent exhibit. There is even a section of the housing these prisoners had to live in for the duration of the war. A sad time in our history but it is important that we know what happened. I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
40,Went for Hello Kitty,"We went to see Hello Kitty, which was fun and cute! We went on a Wednesday afternoon, so it wasn't crowded until later in the day. My only complaint is that because the museum expected such high volume of visitors (and I know they did receive what they were expecting), there weren't as many informative plaques in the exhibit as I wanted, although what's there to say about Hello Kitty?I genuinely loved how the museum had set up their exhibitions so that when you leave Hello Kitty, you walk directly into the Japanese concentration camp exhibition, which is so often skimmed through ever-so-lightly in US history classes. I actually liked the Japanese concentration camp exhibition more than the Hello Kitty exhibit! I also wished the gift shop had more selection of Hello Kitty/JANM exclusive merch.I also recommend visiting Chado Tea Room for lunch, which is attached to the museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifertS8567KL
50,Much better than I expected,"I am not your typical visitor to a Hello Kitty exhibition at the Japanese American National Museum. I am a white male and don't have much of a connection to Japan other than loving all kinds of Japanese food. I took my daughter to the Hello Kitty exhibition and I was glad I did. First of all the neighborhood of Little Tokyo around the museum is interesting. Although touristy and run down, and frankly with restaurants that are a far cry from the ones in newer Japanese enclave on Sawtelle, it is a funky vibrant place with lots of shops to wander in and out of.The museium istself is truly excellent. The exhibits on the journey of Japanese Americans to the US and their struggle to gain stature is really informative and not something you will have learned in school. The section on the Japanese detention centers during WWII is heartbreaking and really shows a shameful side of America's history. The camp mementoes and experiences are presented alongside the achievements of Japanese Americans in battle in WWII. One group is taken from their homes, imprisoned, stripped of their belongings while another group gives their lives to protect freedom while their relatives are themselves imprisoned. You might even shed a tear.On a lighter note, I never really knew how coll Hello Kitty was. The special exhibit showed the history, lots of Hello Kitty items, Hello Kitty art and Hello Kitty impact on contemporary culture. it was a little expensive but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeY892
50,Highly Recommend,"Always nice to go through and see lifes and times of different cultures. Thoroughly enjoyed my time there and it is near shops and restaurants. The museum has its own gift shop and I found quite a few items that I purchased. The location is easy to get to, but sometimes, downtown parking can be challenging. There is a parking lot behind the museum and it is about $8.00 for all day parking. Worth it, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVerneR116
50,Awesome Hello Kitty exhibit,"We really enjoyed the Hello Kitty exhibit. See it before it leaves. If you're a longtime fan of Hello Kitty, you'll be unable to contain yourself. The girl who came in behind us had to get herself together it was so overwhelming. The staff are friendly and the displays are all really professional. It's amazing they managed to acquire all the celeb dresses as well. The gift shop across the street doesn't have a whole lot of items, but what they do have looked cool. I'd definitely visit the museum again to see the regular exhibits. Plus, it makes for part of a great time in Little Tokyo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/illini2000_LA
40,Hello Kitty exhibit a hit!,"We enjoyed the Hello Kitty exhibit and all the information and displays related to that phenomenon. We did not tour the rest of the museum, although the exhibit areas we passed looked impressive. Family friendly stop for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47IU24L
40,"Good, but a little over the top","I'll leave it to others to try to explain why one would pay $20 to see the Hello Kitty stuff. We went for the regular exhibit, on the third Thursday, which has free entry. A very well-documented and most interesting exposition of the history of Japanese in America, with strong emphasis on the internment during WW II, including an actual barracks.While there is no question that what happened was unjust and unduly harsh, I'm not comfortable judging the actions of people 70 years ago by the standards of today. Who knows what the standards of 70 years from now will be and how would we like to be judged by them? Calling the internments ""concentration camps"" links them with the actions of Nazis, with their inhuman actions. Not fair.Still, it is a chapter that must be remembered so that it does not get repeated and it is a great testimony to Japanese-Americans that, while keeping the memory alive, they can largely forgive and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie
40,It is a shameful part of American history,This shows a few tragic years of a group of people who came from Japan and were living and raising families for over 50 years prior to WWII. They were abruptly uprooted and families torn apart taken to camps with only one suitcase of personal possessions. May it never happen again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ki0ki
40,"Kitty fans, be prepared for a dichotomy","A friend took me to the Hello Kitty exhibit here when I visited her in LA. Hello Kitty fans will almost certainly enjoy this extensive and interesting exhibit, which chronicles the origin and evolution of the enduring Sanrio character over the years in the context of American, Japanese, and international pop culture.Prior to my visit, I didn't know anything about this museum, which is why it was jarring when the upbeat, colorful Hello Kitty exhibit ended in the museum's main exhibit space and I found myself in the midst of a detailed history of the shameful and embarrassing internment of Japanese Americans by their own country during WWII. I learned a lot from this exhibit and wish that American society was self-reflective and intelligent enough to apply the lessons from this chapter of history to prevent ongoing and future governmental and societal racism, prejudice, and persecution. It is unfortunate that we are not. Visit this place to honor a noble attempt at historical education against a tidal wave of ignorance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annapZ2325PL
40,Educational and fascinating,"We live in Tokyo (Japan) and were staying in the downtown area of LA, and this place was naturally of interest. Sadly we only had an hour to see it (we were in a rush before New Year closing) but it was well worth it.The main collection tells the story of Japanese immigration to the US from the latter half of the 1800s and the trials and tribulations faced by Japanese, and Americans of Japanese descent, both before and during World War II. It explains in a straightforward way the discrimination they faced and the differing approaches in Hawaii and California. And of course there's the minute detail about the camps people where people were forcibly imprisoned, often in harsh desert conditions, despite in many cases not even speaking Japanese, let alone having done anything wrong.A good museum dealing with an under-appreciated (in my view) topic. Worth a visit if you have some interest in Japanese or Japanese American culture or are staying in the downtown area. I'd seen it once before 2 years ago, and was still moved by it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjb1001
50,Kitty and Camps,"We have visited this museum before but today we were visiting again to see the temporary exhibit, Hello Kitty. I have been owned by many cats, but wasn't too familiar with Hello Kitty, but had heard of it. Hello Kitty began with a vinyl coin purse about 1974 and grew to include hundreds of diverse pieces of merchandise from clothing to motor oil. Case after case featured household goods, school supplies, backpacks, clothes, toys, and too much for me to remember. The exhibit includes about 500 items and a few dozen pieces of Hello Kitty art.This special exhibit begins on the first floor and exits on the second floor into the permanent exhibits. Much of the permanent exhibits center on the World War II camps where Japanese-American citizens were detained during the war. One large exhibit is a section of a preserved barracks, another is a model of Manzanar.The museum is in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles in the shadow of City Hall. There are two gift shops, the standard gift shop in the building and a gift shop for Hello Kitty across a small patio. After the museum, we crossed the street to a plaza for shopping and lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,"Hello, Hello Kitty!","I decided a trip to LA was in order, specifically so I could see the Hello Kitty exhibit. Our family visited on a Sunday afternoon (after eating ramen at Daikokuya). The exhibit tickled the fancy of three generations of women: my mom, who fondly remembered buying cute little Sanrio products for my sister and me 25-30 years ago; me and my still-prevailing love for Hello Kitty at age 35; and my 4-year-old daughter, who has delighted in ""inheriting"" some of my beloved treasures. The exhibit was not crowded, and we could easily view all of the displays at our leisure. It took us about an hour to get through. Of course, I wish it could have been more extensive, but I appreciated that the exhibit spoke to the significance of Hello Kitty on so many levels: as an example of merchandising genius, a global cultural & social icon, and as a muse for modern artistic expression and interpretation. For a $20 admission, it's not cheap, but for those who are fans, it's well worth the fond memories and big smiles.A highlight was seeing a dress made out of Hello Kitty plushes, worn by Lady Gaga.My kid was delighted to find out that she was 8 apples tall -- 3 apples taller than Hello Kitty.There were some cute souvenirs in the gift shop. I bought an exhibition catalog for $30 and a Hello Kitty baking book as mementos of this fun excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UCBGirl98
40,Small but good,Smaller than I expected. My teenage daughter who is a history buff really enjoyed it. I was surprised to learn about the strong Anti-Japanese sentiment that existed in our country for decades before WWII. It was easy to reach by metro. Admission to museum is included with GO card but this does not include the Hello Kitty exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m0ml0vest0travel

50,Great Museum now with Hello Kitty,This museum documents well the history of Japanese Americans. It presents the human emotions and sacrifices for immigration and the toll of social and racial injustice.Took my niece to see the Hello Kitty exhibit. Every woman entering this exhibit had big smiles and enjoyed the event. Never appreciated the impact of this Kitty on lives of females of all ages and backgrounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimpleGuy145
40,Hello Kitty Exhibit!,"Really, if you love Hello Kitty you have to see the exhibit. We were here for the Hello Kitty Con 2014 and the museum exhibit was free. This is a HAPPY exhibit for those who grew up enjoying and owning everything HK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CT97
50,Go before the Hello Kitty exhibit is gone!,"So the entrance fee was covered here with the HK con day pass and the bonus was the extra shop outside the actual museum. What a wonderfully compiled exhibit that went through the ages of HK as she was ""growing up"" and all the Hk inspired art work that followed. I had a permanent smile on my face, looking through the different items and remembering fondly of the sparse treasures I had while growing up; we had to travel to the USA to buy Sanrio products when I was a little girl so I really valued the collectibles I had collected. They did a good job of limiting the number of visitors inside so that everyone could have an enjoyable time and not feel cramped. At the end of the exhibit, I had the opportunity to walk through the rest of the museum and experience more of the Japanese culture. There is a gift shop at the front of the building, however, I think they added a pop up shop outside as well. I wish I had more room in my suitcase to buy more stuff but it was already at full capacity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazy_cat_sab
50,History beautifully displayed,"All the staff were super friendly, their entire space is beautiful inside and does put a lot of thought in displaying the good, bad and the ugly parts of history where Japanese had participated in US through time. A very brave display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wannabefoodieHouston
50,Thought provoking museum,"This museum focuses on the Japanese experience during internment in World War II. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, ""it was not our finest hour."" Fear let us to trample the Constitution. One frightening hangover from that period is that the Supreme Court decision, Korematsu versus the United States, that rendered internment legal is still on the books and it's still good law. This is a place in every American should visit and think about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stein525
50,Best date ever,It was amazing we went for a date it was so interesting learning new thing just makes you open your eyes to things you've never known before and it doesn't stop there the shops around just bring the whole Japanese culture all in one place absolutely amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyaraeannc

20,"The BLDG is nice, the staff is wonderful but the contents, artifacts, displays and parking is horrible.","I love Asian Culture and History. I was very disappointed. I guess this facility is more for lectures, presentations and meetings than an actual ""Museum"" this place should renamed Japanese American National Meeting Hall or Exhibit Center or Cultural Center. The main items/displays centered around the Special Detention Camps that the US Govt created during the WWII. Many displays talked about the wrongs that the US GOVT did during the WWII. This was sad but true. It also talked about how the Japanese Immigrants had it worse than Chinese Immigrants. In fact, I think there may had been a hidden agenda bringing up a lot of discrimination and comparing it to the Black Slave at times. I expected more bragging/examples of Japanese Leaders in Business, Industry, Education, Government, Sports and Inventors. This was lacking. The Dodger's Display was interesting but it focused on the diversity of the MLB and the Dodgers and no doubt talked about Jackie Robinson. To be honest, my wife and i left confused. It seemed like the museum was stressing White Man Guilt during WWII. We wanted to learn more about Japan, Japanese Lifestyle, Famous Japanese Americans, what the Japanese did for America and what is contributed to Japanese society. For Example , a famous Jewish Man brought Levi Strauss Jeans to America. Albert Einstein (A Jewish American) helped the US during the WWII and beyond. Geroge Washington Carver( The Peanut Man) and so on. This museum lacked Umpf. I'm sure there could have been displays of people with Japanese Roots such the beautiful Ann Curry from NBC, Danny Tani (NASA Astronaut), Pat Morita (Famous Actor), the famous Judge Ito who parents lived in the WWII camps, Figure Skater Kristi Yamaguchi and the Former Senator of Hawaii was Nisei.I would not pay to see this museum go on the free day.I also was disappointed and not impressed with the Tattoo exhibit. It was boring and sickening. IT made me think of the Asian gang called the Yazuka. I also thought some plants would have been nice or popular foods displays at least pictures. Restaurants and companies started in America by Japanese immigrants. All and all. This place has potential but it didn't lift off the ground. The staff is wonderful and the building is awesome but the displays and public education is lacking beyond the WWII camp displays and the American Anti-Asian Immigration rules, policies that stop citizenship and property rights. Even a 15 minute orientation movie would have been nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr
40,History,"Enjoyable! We planned to spend a few hours in Little Tokyo, when we came across the Japanese America History Museum. We spent our afternoon in the museum. A must do for everyone.

40,Worthwhile,"If you want to try something different with family in LA. Stay and play in Little Tokyo for 2 days.

50,Gem in Los Angeles,"I have been twice to this cultural icon in Los Angeles. The photos and narration provide a part of history never told in our history. As a proud American of Mexican descent, I am reminded of stories my parents told me. I can relate to some of the humiliation of racism but not the internment camps. You can see the importance of families and their values in the photos. I know that this museum provides a constant reminder of the value of Japanese Americans. Truly a gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Needasub
40,A museum worth seeing,The exhibits in this museum are excellent. There is Perseverance which is a Japanese Tattoo exhibit at the museum until September. There is also one on the internment of the Japanese Americans and another on baseball. Very different subjects extremely well done. Their gift shop is beautiful. Definitely worth going to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bettihomemaker

50,90 Minutes Well Spent,"As you tour downtown Los Angeles, spare an hour and a half to learn about the Japanese American experience, particularly here in Los Angeles.

30,Could Be Better,"This is truly a lovely little museum, but you really need to do your own research about the exhibits before you go to really appreciate them. The venue seems to target a Japanese American audience exclusively, rather than reaching out to the wider Los Angeles community. On the plus side, it is right in the midst of Little Tokyo and near the Metro Gold Line. Great food and shopping, and fun place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
50,Japanese Museum in Los Angeles,Beautiful museum and if you are interested in learning about the interment of the Japanese during WW11 the exhibit is extraordinary.

50,Informative and sobering,"Great photos and amazing documentation of the Japanese Americans history, some of the pieces brought tears to my eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzravencan
50,AMAZING Staff and outstanding museum!,"I cannot say enough about the staff at this museum! Specifically Helen Ota! We live in Seattle and my son is doing a documentary on the Japanese Interment camps and how the rights of the Japanese were violated. We were unable to find any institution in Seattle to help us get an interview with an internee (not even Densho!!). In doing a web search, we found out that the JANM was having an event to commemorate the signing of EO9066. My son called the museum to inquire if there would be ex-internees attending and if he'd be allowed to ask to interview them.Not only were we told yes, but Helen went above and beyond and set up multiple interviews for my son! When we arrived, she took us to a private conference room where we could set up our equipment and do the interviews! We totally expected (and were happy with the idea) that we'd be doing them in a hallway or something. She had spread the word amongst the folks who were presenting at the event that my son was coming, so everywhere he went, he was given special items for his research (a teacher's guide with a DVD, old magazines, etc). One gal even gave him a special piece of art she'd made.The museum itself was a gold mine of photos and things that he could use in his documentary. There were lots of unique pieces that were not on the web. There was one area we weren't allowed to photograph, but we were given permission to look on the museum website...and borrow the photos if the item was in the archives. The CEO of the museum greeted us before we left and asked that we send him a copy of the completed documentary on DVD for their library.Support this wonderful museum! Not only does it contain some incredible pieces of history, but the folks running it are incredible beyond words.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBah
50,A great learning experience ...,"... even though I've grown up hearing these same stories. There is not much else I can't add beyond what all the other reviewers have already reported. I did walk away reminded of how easy this can happen again, not necessarily to the Japanese Americans, but rather to any group of people that the public fears, or a political actions deem them as 'not American enough.'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/treerod1
50,Wonderful museum,"Our grandson wanted to visit this museum when we took him to Los Angeles last summer. When we first entered the museum, a man approached us and asked us if we would like to hear his family's story of the experiences they had as Japanese Americans during World War II. We agreed that we would, and he showed us pictures of his family and told us the sad truth about them, as well as other Japanese Americans, who were treated inhumanely and callously during World War II because of their Japanese heritage.After talking to this gentleman, we continued through the museum, seeing the wonderful exhibits, artwork and films that further described the way America treated these people. As I read and saw the museum's exhibits, I felt ashamed that our country would do this; we all felt sad, and so sorry that this happened.I recommend that anyone who has access to Los Angeles visit this museum, and plan to spend an afternoon of reflection and then resolution to be more sensitive to others. It left me with a far greater respect for any race or group who have had to suffer the indignities of being treated less than other humans.The staff at the museum are polite and helpful, reminding people that this is a place for meditation and quiet reflection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vinopopos
50,This is about the gift shop,"I just visited today with my adult daughter who spent 2 weeks as a high school exchange student in Japan. From the other reviews you already know what an uplifting and enlightening experience it is to visit the exhibits, enhanced by the wonderful volunteers who tell you their life stories.But this is about the gift shop. There are wonderful, unique treats here. Japanese flashcards to help young learners. One of a kind jewelry pieces, tea sets, tee shirts, and tea blends from Chado Tearoom next door. The most valuable part to me is the selection of books, music and videos. Buy the Manzanar video, then donate it to your local school or library. Read a book out loud to a grandchild. Learn more about Japanese American history from first person accounts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momof3frenchhornists
50,Amazing Experience,"The museum is located just across the street Little Tokyo and very close to the Gold Line station, so it is very easy to access without having to drive. However, if you have to drive there is parking all around the area. I paid $8 for a spot across the street. The museum itself is very new and modern. The first floor is made up of a few temporary exhibitions and the second floor is made up of all the main exhibitions.As you walk upstairs, you begin a journey back in time...a very sad portion of American history that should not be forgotten. The main portion of this museum is comprised of artifacts and stories from the WWII Concentration campus the US placed hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans in. What really made this museum stand out to me are the docents. The docent I was privileged with talk to me for over an hour telling stories about his occupation and daily life in the concentration camps.Admission is only $9 (Students $5 w/ID). On Thursdays between 5pm and 8pm it'[s free to get in. The 3rd Thursday of every month is free all day. They are closed on Mondays.If you happen to be in the Little Tokyo area of downtown LA, this is a great museum to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelvinRyan
50,Lost in the history lessons,"The Japanese American National Museum has chronicled the history of Japanese Americans with special emphasis on the forced evacuation of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, many American citizens by birth, from the West Coast to 10 camps surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. The photos and artifacts tell many stories, but most impressive is the partial reconstruction of one of the tar paper covered barracks from the Heart Mountain, Wyoming camp. To view through the windows of a single room in which a family lived is especially moving. The Museum is bright and clean with meetings rooms and a museum store. Walking tours of the Little Tokyo historical area are available. Check the Museum website for special events such as lectures, discussions and instructional workshops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professorhosokawa
50,Wonderful cultural experience,"for someone with Japanese heritage/culture background, it was a wonderful multi-sensory experience for learning. i took my young adult daughter there and she was able to really learn about her background culture and the experiences her uncles, aunts and grandparents went through in the US",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamoshanter1106
50,"Proud Heritage, Sad History","A great museum highlighting the sad history of the internment and taking of civil rights of Japanese-Americans during the hysteria following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Also much more on the history of the Japanese since their immigration to the US and their history in the United States. The exhibits of the great Japanese-American leaders are an inspiration to all who aspire to be American. I wish every American, especially students, could see this wonderful exhibit. I hope to visit again with my grandchildren.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronwatanabe
50,Wonderful!,"I visited the JANM with my three teenage daughters. The JANM traces the Japanese American experience in the United States from the earliest immigrants to the present, with a big emphasis on the first half of the 20th century and the internment of American citizens of Japanese descent (and others) during the second world war. It is an important part of our nation's history of which every US citizen should be aware if we are not to repeat this shameful treatment of our own citizens and other innocent people. It is also a great history lesson that highlights the stunningly discriminatory laws that have existed in our parents' lifetime and a reason to celebrate how far we have come as a nation in protecting the civil rights of our citizens and embracing the diversity of our population. The facility is absolutely beautiful and it is obvious that a lot of thought went into its design and layout. After your visit, you have an opportunity to walk across the street to dine at one of the many great Japanese restaurants (yum!) or buy a confection at the Yamazaki bakery. There are also stores selling Japanese goods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IzzyK808
50,An Amazing Experience,"The Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, LA is amazing. A great deal of thought was put into the design of the exhibits. As a Japanese-American I can tell you that it was a touching display and the guides were incredibly insightful. My son now has a better understanding of how things were in the United States during WWII for Japanese Americans and this knowledge and the experience he had at the museum are priceless. Many thanks to all who contributed in making this museum a truly amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gette413
50,True Gem,"My family visited this museum which is located close to Japanese town in LA. The museum centers around the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII. The exhibits are creative, interesting, and thought provoking. Many explore issues relating to race and individual identity. We were fortunate enough to meet a gentleman who had been interned in a camp as a high school senior and then served in the Pacific during WWII. He provided us with insightful commentary that was one of the highlights of our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmphilly
40,Exploring downtown Los Angeles,This was our first visit to this museum. It was very informative. We all learned a lot about the treatment of Japanese in the US. It would have been better if the museum was more interactive. Loved the film previews!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimimeme
50,Understated and effective portrayal of an often misunderstood minority,"In today's multicultural America there are many museums that celebrate the travails and achievements of different ethnic groups, but few that do that as persuasively as this one. The emphasis here is on the experience of Japanese Americans who were displaced and interned in spartan concentration camps during World War II, but visitors also learn a great deal about the lives of early Japanese immigrants and the resurgence of Japanese-American culture after the war. There are familiar faces like those of now deceased U.S. Senator Danial Inouye and classical violinist Midori was well as others who were more self-effacing and whose stories seem all the fresher and more relevant because they are less well known. The museum presents the Japanese experience in linear fashion and incorporates fascinating artifacts including a transported and reassembled internment camp residence hut whose uncaulked timbers underscore the privations that were suffered in cold desert winters. The underlying message is quite sober, pointing as it does to America's willingness to dispense with some freedoms when others are threatened, and to the perils of scapegoating when times are tough. But there is an almost complete lack of special pleading; visitors are left to draw their own conclusions more often than told what to think. This is a model than many others might emulate. Even if you suspect the Japanese-American story is irrelevant to your life, you might be surprised at how it draws you in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taughboyne
50,Great exhibits and lots of knowledgable docents,"Have been here a number of times and always have a good visit. From the current exhibits to the ongoing exhibits, I always learn something -- especailly since there is always a docent to help. Many of the docents were incarcerated in the concentration camps during World War II and offer first hand commentary. Some of the docents served in the MIS or 442, the most decorated unit during WWII and are equally fascinating to talk to. Set in the middle of Little Tokyo, there is plenty to do in the area as well. Lots of programs to choose from, check their website to see what's on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/websurfonly
50,Loved this!,This is an incredible museum! One of the best we have ever been to. Our favorite part of it was the section where they did a simulation of what the Japanese Americans had to live with during the war. There was so much to read and learn while we were there. Definitely required another visit but we never got to it while we lived there. This is a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjscollins
50,Best Downtown Attraction in LA,"I am little biased because I have a Japanese American background but I think this is the best attraction downtown. The Japanese American story of immigration, surviving racial prejudice and internment, and perseverance to great successes today is also a great American story. The building is spectacular and check their calendar for one of their many interesting events.Check out this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nakaboots
50,Excellent museum on Japanese-American history in the US,"The Japanese-American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles provides an excellent historical background on how the Japanese influenced the country's growth and history. The museum is located in the Little Tokyo section and is easy to find. It is a good sized two-story complex with exhibits, a tea room, research center, conference room and a store. It costs $9 for an adult. The museum is open everyday except Mondays and certain holidays. There are also certain times where the admission fee is waived. It is best to check the website for these times Photography is not allowed inside.All of the exhibits were located on the second floor. You start by briefly learning the early times when the Japanese first came across the Pacific to the Kingdom of Hawaii (before it became a US state) and the mainland of the US. Most of the exhibits are tailored towards WWII and the US Internment of Japanese Americans on the west coast. They have part of one of the original cabins used at one of the camps on display where you can get a sense of what it might have been like.You can walk through the museum on your own, but you'll get more out of your visit if you take a tour from one of the docents. While I had read most of the information already in the first part of the exhibit, the docent provided more details that filled in the gaps. The second part that focuses on WWII and afterwards show how the Japanese Americans helped the US succeed.While I thought that the museum focused too much on the internment during WWII, I still learned a lot and would highly recommend visiting the museum. Even those who've been there before will find temporary exhibits that change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wbullseye
50,Do Not Miss,"Should be required for all those under age 50. Wonderful, informative, factual, easy to get to, safe neighborhood and a friendly, competent staff. Young persons need to understand how badly our culture and society treated Japanese-Americans during WW II.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillT360
50,Japanese Art and History,"The Museum is in Little Tokio, near a branch of MOCA. There are several galleries with art and history. On one visit we came across an exhibit telling us how to make origami swans for, I don't remember what, but the idea was visitors would make thousands of these to commemorate something. I've forgotten the details, but remember help my wife to make the swan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,"Don't miss CHADO, the Tea Room in the Terasaki Garden Cafe","The museum provides an incite into 20th-century American history that is often swept under the carpet. A must see.Afterward stop and have tea in Chado; outstanding food served by a knowledgable wait staff, in a delightful garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEAS512
50,Interesting Art and Exhibitions,"JANM is in a great location, and has interesting artwork. I went for the Giant Robot Biennial and the show was amazing! I went back several times. Japanese culture is a major influence, especially in pop culture, and when you're in DTLA, and roaming little Toyko, Koreatown, etc. a stop at JANM is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdaPia
30,"Giant Robot Exhibit, But No Robots","When we first heard about the annual giant robot exhibit at the JANM we thought our son would enjoy seeing all the robots. However, the name is a misnomer. The exhibit is named after the kids store, nearby and there are no large, ""actual"" robots. There are cases and cases of robots on exhibit, but these are hand-made robots, anywhere from one inch to 12 inches tall, handmade, without any moving parts--they are not robotic. Their robots are models of robots. They do represent the cultural interests of Japanese American kids/teens, however, but they do not move, and they are not giant--by any means. From an adults perspective, you are invited into the post modern view of very creative people. You can see the influence of 'Japanese Anime:' Japanese Animated products, TV and film figures. But there are no large (giant) robots anywhere to be found. On the other hand, you are introduced to up-and-coming LA artist, you get a glimpse of what goes on inside the minds of people influenced by Japanese Anime, and there are some very good works of art displayed. You can also experience life of a Japanese immigrant to the US around the turn of the century, and during World War II. There is a reconstructed living quarters that gives you an idea of life in concentration camps. There is a pile of suitcases and some artifacts showing how little the immigrants brought with them and how much of the life they are used to living is left behind. The experience is very well done and adults or more advanced teens will learn much from their visit to the JANM, but our 4 yo was thoroughly bored and disappointed. He really wanted to see a giant robot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariachurchill
40,Worth seeing,"I visited the museum because they have free night Thursdays so I only had to pay for parking in the lot across the street ; $7.Now that I have been I can say I wouldn't mind paying the admission price. It is very interesting to see old photos and relics of Japanese settlers in the area. Caution, you may read the blurbs that accompany the displays and feel embarrassed to be a westerner. I learnt a few things and wished I had have visited with someone so as to discuss what we had seen there (or debate about it).In addition to the museum section they also have special exhibits throughout the year which change every few months. I saw the robot exhibit which was quite fascinating. I'll go back to see the next exhibit and partake in various activities they have throughout the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cultdiva
40,Very Good Museum But...,"September 2012. Great museum and facilties. You can hold conferences and workshops at their conference center and have receptions inside and outside of their facility. There are few Asian American & Pacific Islander American museums in the States. This museum also has a library that features many genelogy of Japanese American familes that have been in the United States since the early 1900s. They also have great doscents. Some revolving exhibits. But...the bulk of the museum displays have remained unchanged since early 2002, so we found this visit not to be anything new. Photography is not permitted within the museum. There is a great gift shop inside the museum. There were not too many visitors there as well. Still if you have never been here and want to learn about Asian American history then I recommend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeminarTrekker
40,A Graphic Display of The WWII Internment camps,"A very real portrayal of Japanese life in America before WWII. The displays the interruption in the lives of long time Japanese-Americans, thru their interments in the camps and their difficulties after the war.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockwallTraveler
40,Origami -- wow!,"We only saw the origami exhibit, so I can't comment on the permanent collections. But the origami art was amazing!! Also very nicely displayed -- a cool museum visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641SusanS641
50,One of the best places in L.A.,"This is not only one of the best museums anywhere, but one of the best spots in L.A. Exhibits are well done and meaningful. Delightful gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimP605
40,Great for a general audience,"Visitors to the museum naturally divide into two groups -- Japanese Americans (who are now often referred to as ""nikkei,"" from the Japanese word for ""related to Japan"") and non-Japanese Americans. The exhibits at the museum, judging from the reviews in Trip Advisor, are generally very interesting and informative to non-Japanese Americans, who probably often drop in during a general tour of downtown Los Angeles and Little Tokyo.As a Japanese-American, I made a special trip into Los Angeles to visit the Museum. I was already aware of much of the information contained in the displays, and, as such, was a bit disappointed at the lay-out, which emphasized photographs with brief descriptions in small print, and their disjointed nature. I thought there could have been less emphasis on the internment history, more emphasis on the theme of developing and preserving community, and greater context in terms of the history of Japanese emigration to other destinations, such as Canada and Latin America. My daughter, however, certainly benefited from the visit and very much appreciated reading the statements regarding ""you know you're Japanese-American when.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KalaniHS72
40,educational,"I learned much more thanI thought I would, as did my daughter---very informative. I was very impressed with the way it was presented, also, and shocked that I knew so little. I think this should be a mandatory field trip for all middle school students.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k99mom
40,"Enlightening, challenging, interesting","The exhibit upstairs about the WWII internment was incredible. Although it was hard to see the heartbreaking stories of this horrible experience for so many Japanese Americans, it was a helpful insight to gain a great appreciation of what these victims endured. It is a challenge for us as Americans of all races to ensure this kind of injustice never occurs in our nation again. The special traveling exhibit on origami was very interesting as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RevfromCA
40,Must-see when visiting Little Tokyo,"I visited this museum during their special Origami exhibit and found it to be particularly fascinating, that one could fold paper into such intricate and unimaginable shapes is awe inspiring, I will never view a sheet of plain paper in the same way again!The museum also has a permanent display outlining the experiences of the Japanese in America, it gives context and meaning to a visit to Little Tokyo and is very enlightening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellinjenna
50,A great educational place to learn about little known American History!,"First off, I knew quite a bit about it as I am a Japanese American, however, I was interested in learning more. This is for ALL Americans to learn about what was done strictly based on ancestry. It has always been appaling knowing how they were treated, but learning there were many Caucasian Americans who helped the innocent people, many who lost everything was great to learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasakidalem
30,Interesting Museum,"I visited in March 2012. I thought the graphics were a little dated but the story of America's treatment is a compelling one. However, i found the constant use of ""concentration camp"" most inappropriate. The Japanese and Japanese -Americans illegally lost their liberty in internment camps. Nothing that took place in the internment camps compares with the horrors of the Third Reich concentration camps and for this reason the term to me is overkill when discussing internment camps.One thing sadly missing was the contriburtion of Japanese-Americans to American Society in 2012. The Museum was silent on what I suspect is an important point in our multicultural society. The Museum seems frozen in time that ended in 1945.The Museum is easily accessible by the Gold Rail line.The Gift Shop has some delightful hand made note cards that are so beautiful that it will be a struggle to send them. The nearby Japanese shopping area was most interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dachinghwa
50,Great history about Japanese Americans,We heard about the museum and friends said we would not be disappointed. The museum is full of artifacts and information about the Japanese American experiences in the USA. Most profound are the exhibits of the internment and the men who fought for our country. Stop by the 44nd/100th Memorial which is just up the mall from the museum.There are docents who are informative and helpful. We found information about several relatives who were interned during WWII.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lkmama
40,Museum shows shameful treatment of Japanese-Americans in World War II,"The museum provided a very complete picture of the camps in which innocent Japanese citizens were incarcerated in World War II. It included many photos and stories of individuals affected by this tragedy, as well as artifacts found at the camps. Also, it described the desolate environment of the camps in inhospitable regions of the desert. A building from one of the camps had been torn down and rebuilt in the museum, so you could see its small living space and thin walls. Additionally, we saw a miniature model of one of the camps. One exhibit pointed out that property and businesses were taken from the incarcerated, so that they had to start all over again after their release. All in all, it was a very informative experience illustrating life for the Japanese in a very shocking episode of U.S. history.Additionally, the tea room offered many different delicious kinds of teas as well as tasty deserts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Makewaves
20,Boring. Should have skipped it.,"I wasn't all that impressed with this museum. They had some decent artifacts, but it was mostly plain and boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
50,Pleasantly surprised!,The Japanese American National Museum had a lot of photos and information. It was extremely sad and disturbing that they had to endure such hardships to prove they were true Americans. I would highly recommend a visit by all. It is across from the Jpapnese Village Plaza. We were lucky because admission was free for my family( 2nd Thursday of the month is free admission). Be sure to check out the outdoor Go for Broke memorial as well- a very unknown story about the most highly decorated soldiers( the Japanese Americans) of World War II.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Windwardites
