30,Not the most exciting,"This is a fairly small museum, with the first floor dedicated to Max Factor Makeup and the actresses who used it. It was fun to see. The upper floors had images of various superheroes, tv personalities, etc. with a very large display on the Pointer Sisters. I felt there was more interesting Hollywood history to display than what was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLZA
50,"Hollywood surprise, so much to see and learn here.","Great experience for the whole family, the museum is packed full of interesting insights, props, costumes and sets. We went specifically for the 60's Batman display but there was so much more. Other highlights include the Back to the Future display and the Silence of the Lambs jail cell set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenpersiaau
50,Entertaining the world,"In a gorgeous Art Deco building, this is an absorbing portrait of Hollywood's heyday. Make-up rooms were fascinating to see; the attention that was lavished on stars was rewarded in the great roles they played.Marilyn Monroe features prominently, having her personal room for the art and also in evocative black and white photos.There is a fine array of photos featuring legendary stars such as Jimmy Cagney, Burt Lancaster and of course Lucille Ball of Here’s Lucy fame.Other exhibits included costumes of the Pointer Sisters and props plus artefacts from famous films.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,"Must do for ""older generation"" Hollywood Fans","Based in what was the old Max Factor Building it houses a huge collection of Hollywood History, costumes and memorabilia...given the ""make up history"" there is a lot of items relating to the history of make up in the early days but there is also some great costumes and photos to view.... if your a ""Hollywood Tragic"" its worth it.... surprising not that busy when we were there.... seemed like more people at the ""Museum of Selfies"".... which seemed a shame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alex198876
50,Hollywood Museum,"Several floors of Great movie memorabilia, personal items and photos from early Hollywood actors and tv shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/371darlenel
50,LOVED IT!,"We visited on a Sunday afternoon. Absolutely loved the first floor rooms especially the Lucille Ball room! Nice collection of Hollywood movie memorabilia. The lower floor included Horror Movie exhibits which we really enjoyed. The third floor included ""Ever After...A Pointer Sister Collection"" which would be amazing IF you are a Pointer Sister junkie. Nice presentation but it was not a draw at all. We looked and went to the next floor. Top floor was Back to the Future (again nice) which shared the floor with ""80 Years of Batman, the Bionic Woman and Six Million Dollar Man, the Catwoman Exhibits"" which was a bit disappointing because some of the costumes looked like the logos were printed off the color printer and pinned onto the chest of the costumed mannequins. Ultimately - the value for the exhibits is not to be missed! Highly recommend. Very convenient location. Shop around for parking because we found parking in the vicinity from $10 to $40",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian07663NJ
30,Don’t have high expectations,It was cheap but you have to be into old movies eg. Marilyn Monroe era and a whole floor dedicated to the Pointer sisters like really? The horror basement was quite good which is how it got to average. I’m a Batman fan and was a bit underwhelmed. I would have spent no more than 30 mins here and that’s including moving through 4 floors.No need to go if you are under the age of 40.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazer82563
50,Fab-u-lous,"Hollywood museum is fabulous, so much to see and read about, some many props, articles and fantastic exhibits, the 66' batman was utterly amazing, need a long time to soak it all up, well worth avisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
20,Boring...,"If you like make up and that stuff, it’s probable interesting. If you’re into Hollywood memorabilia then don’t waste your time. They have some few original memorabilia’s from movie sets, but most of it is replicas. They have really thrown a lot of stuff into a small space, and some quotes from movies here and there that they probably found funny and cool. Just wasn’t the hype it seemed to be when we googled it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonabb
30,Not bad for the price,"During our trip there were four main exhibits distributed over four floors. The basement was my favorite since I'm pretty crazy for horror stuff. The 1st floor has a lot of the ""Old Hollywood"" stuff, which is interesting to see, especially if you've watched any of the older movies and TV shows. Unless you're an avid fan, it's a pretty quick trip through there though. The 2nd floor was dedicated to the Pointer Sisters which I felt was a bit overkill and I didn't particularly care for it personally. The 3rd floor had the Batman exhibit along with a large chunk dedicated to the LGTBQ community in film. I think in total it took us about an hour to get through and it was worth the price of admission even if there were a few exhibits we weren't the target audience for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
50,Lots to see,We did the four story walk up self guided tour. Lots to see and read. The building is the original Max Factor building so fairly historical in itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LF918
50,A star studded visit!,"Spent a few hours wandering around the Hollywood Museum, located in the stunning Max Factor building. Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball were frequent clients back in the golden age of Hollywood 🌟🌟 There is something of interest for all ages. We especially loved the Batman exhibition. Entry is only $15 and well worth it. You do need to be aware that only the entrance floor is wheelchair accessible as the other floors are accessed via stairs. Would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzieP882
10,Hollywood Museum - Dirty and Outdated,"Very disappointed, especially after reading these good reviews. The exhibits haven’t been updated since Silence of the Lambs. Mostly old junk from Lucille Ball/Marilyn Monroe days, I Dream of Jeanie, Gillian’s Island, Old Batman, etc. One whole floor is dedicated to the Pointer Sisters. Seems a waste unless you’re really into them. Another floor (bsmt) is just creepy horror movie stuff. The floors aren’t large either. This whole museum needs renovated, refreshed, and more updated. I wouldn’t waste my time or money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJHami
40,Great Museum,"If you are interested in Hollywood and movies, definitely add this to your itinerary. My family really enjoyed seeing actual costumes and props from our favourite movies and TV shows. There is something for everyone in here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripleThreatNT
40,"Good Museum, Included in Go Card","I actually visited in June 2018, however due to travelling all over the world for the last 18 months, I am just in the process of writing all the reviews. This was a little different to what I imagined but still good. I thought it would include a little Hollywood history but it’s basically a props museums with a couple information exhibits. I wasn’t bothered either way as the props were interesting to look at too. It’s got 4 floors of memorabilia. The first floor focuses on Max Factor; the makeup of makeup artists. The second and third floor are more movie props and costumes including a Marilyn exhibit and Harry Potter props. The third floor was mainly dedicated to 1960s Batman but I didn’t think that was very good as all the props were replicas which took something away from the exhibit. There’s also a basement level which includes props from the horror genre. This museum is included in the LA Go Card so it’s worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikkiBee
50,Interesting for those interested in Hollywood,"If you aren’t interested in Hollywood, modern or silver screen then don’t go here. I have been twice and each time there has been something different. Love seeing all the movie props. If you like Batman you must go! Each time we have been there has been a whole floor pretty much dedicated to Batman (series with Adam west mostly) my sister loves Batman so this worked out well. Love the layout too. Wish you could do more interactive things in the Marilyn and Lucy Ball rooms but it is a museum after all so I do understand this. Not too pricy, easy to get to and go at your own pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo71ey
40,Very Interesting Museum,"This is a museum of Old Hollywood which covers film making in the early days. I( found all of the exhibits to be interesting, particularly the Max Factor exhibit and the basement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
40,Nice Museum,Worth a visit but not essential. Housed in the building made famous by Max Factor there are a lot of Hollywood artefacts especially related to make up. Feels a bit tired but there are definitely points of interest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509waynem
40,Interesting collection of Hollywood memorabilia,"We went here specifically to see some artifacts from one of my favorite films, ""The Last Starfighter"".It is in an old make up factory, so there are some interesting displays on movie stars and their makeup.Lots of random items from various movies and television shows. There is certainly something that would interest most people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikehU7921OX
30,"Nice, but",It is a museum jam-packed with memorabilia. But it is shop 1 and getting to be a little bit tawdry. One floor is entirely dedicated to The pointer sisters and who knows why.By the way handicap accessibility is a little bit poor and you have to go up steps to enter the museum. There is no ramp.the numerous photo catalog is almost entirely black and white which is a shame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tessx
40,Hollywood Museum,Cute little museum. Had cool stuff. Favorite thing was the horror room downstairs. Set up very well. Good price for admission. Would visit again if they rotate the items on display. Staff very friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakergfan24
40,Worth a visit if nearby.,"I really enjoyed our visit here. It was all very interesting from the history of the building itself to all the e exhibits. Not sure all of the exhibits were the real (some replicas).If you are nearby and looking for something to do than I recommend, but I would not go out of my way to make a visit unless you have a keen interest in Max Factor and 1930’s and 1940’s actresses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reneeandjohn
50,Excellent and fun!,"It opened in 1935 as a famous make up palace to the stars, and the history inside is awesome! in addition to seeing the different rooms where Max made Lucille Ball's hair red and Marilyn Monroe's hair blond, you see actual makeup and dresses of the stars. Other areas showcase props and costumes form movies, tv shows and actors. The BATMAN area was worth the admission price",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelhound711
50,MUST SEE! So much fun real memorabilia!,"5 stars. My wife and I took our 13 year old granddaughter who is a movie/stage nut and actually quite accomplished performer herself. She was mesmerized.. she knows a lot about makeup and it’s use on stage and was thrilled to see the actual make up and the rooms where “Max” did his magic. She was especially thrilled to see the places where real actresses like Marilyn Monroe, Lucile Ball et all in her words..” sat their butts right there” lol.There are many exhibits and memorabilia that was cool for all of us.. batmobile for me lol. The gowns and Lucile ball stuff my wife really liked.The basement area was cool too.. house of horrors stuff from the silence of the lambs to Sweeney Todd ( my granddaughters favorite).You got to see this place, so fun for all ages.Park next door. $20 for all day and after the tour go to the walk of fame or just wander up and down Hollywood blvd.Like or comment if this helps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959edp
40,Very good,"All museums strike me as sad, because they celebrate past heydays. I was interested in all the Max Factor stuff. Batman/Catwoman exhibits good. Loved Liz Taylor's wedding dress for ""Father of the Bride"". Don't know if there was an elevator but the stairs looked a bit dicey - however I'm 75 and scampered up and down them ok. I loved reading the placards relating to the exhibits. Note that the museum is closed on certain days of the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixiehat
50,Wow! So many old school treasures with new mixed in!,"This place is in the heart of it all but not crowded. First it is in the beautiful Art Deco Max Factor building. Make sure you check out the bathrooms - it is a stunning time warp. Tons of old props including the Batmobile and the Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman stuff. Old superheros including Wonder Woman, fun horror stuff in the basement. They even have a pair of Dorothy's ruby red slippers. We spent about two hours in here and had a BLAST!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbatts4309
30,Silence of the Lambs Cell,This is definitely an interesting place. I learned quite a bit. As for as a museum - is say it’s more like walking through memorabilia collection. Its just very disorganized and pieced together. A lot of the information is hidden behind other awkwardly placed items. It looks more like an attic of a museum. The basement has the horror films. Also haphazardly placed but I liked it the most.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkus1968
50,Best Movie/TV Museum in Hollywood,This Museum allows photos and video. They have everything from Planet of the Apes masks and set stuff to Adam West costume. I feel like I could go again and still see new things. This place is worth the money it cost. Fun for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1214KLkimberlyd
40,Makeup tricks for the stars revealed. Cool Bat Mobile. Interesting old camera equipment.,"The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The street level exhibits were the most interesting - makeup & hair by Max Factor for various stars, esp. Marilyn Monroe, was interesting. Pink for brunettes, green for red heads, blue for blondes -- interesting to see the various colors/backlighting. This level was also full of wonderful photos (many autographed) by the old time movie stars. The basement was full of horror movie stuff - not my cup of tea. Top floor was just about everything you could think of all in one place, including Elizabeth Taylor's wedding dress in Father of the Bride and a good copy of the Bat Mobile - my husband was impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeepPurple110
40,This really should be 3 1/2 stars,"We love TV and movies and are always checking out museums and special exhibits. This museum is very interesting and has a lot of unique items. They have a pair of Dorothy's ruby slippers from WoZ. Another highlight is the Batman exhibit which contains many original props, as well as some very good reproductions. My only real complaint about the museum is it's lack of sinage to indicate, in many cases, whether an item is an original or reproduction and its provenance. I'm glad we went but do think it could be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1187HBlisag
30,"Extravagant name, underfunded organization","If you are looking for a comprehensive museum of the movie industry, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you are fascinated by golden-age Hollywood costuming and makeup, this is the place; you can learn more about Max Factor and the actresses with whom he worked than you can imagine. Beyond that, though, this struck me as a venue with much wasted potential. For example, they have a room of still shots of historic Hollywood. It might've been fascinating, but a row (or more, depending on your personal height) is mounted over sight line, and several rows are mounted below most people's waists. Duplicate, not original, props and costumes are behind plexiglass, while what looked like genuine antique film equipment is out in the middle of the floor. The Museum could do with some better curating, in short.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyMartin
50,Interesting Museum,It's a little dated but very interesting and worth a visit. A couple hours will be enough time. Things are a little dated but that's alright.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq
50,Interesting Fine in the Heart of Hollywood,A great place to visit and learn some interest things about old Hollywood. Many interesting photos and fun facts. A great escape from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Statenali
50,Well worth the visit without the hefty price tag,Great place to come if you are interested in Hollywood makeup and design. Also some really great props and costumes from 60's-90's television.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1audgirl
30,Ancient history...,"Very interesting nittygritty details of old Hollywood, not for everyone. Interesting to find out about the make up and wig history and a beatiful building (old Max Factor building). Very Nice next door restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SivHarriet
40,Something different,We really enjoyed this museum. It had some unusual exhibits. My favourite was the horror section downstairs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1weetwood
50,Two thumbs up to this great museum!,"Located where Max Factor had his makeup studios, this offers a good look into the history of Hollywood. A good many costumes and props are on display here. As well, equipment used in filming these movies is featured. Finally, the original makeup studios which occupied this building are reconstructed for public view. I give this museum two thumbs up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arejaysee
50,A great experience,"This museum was a very good experience. The staff were very kind and helpful, and we got a chance to see the very special elevator :) They had a lot of fun and interesting things on display - we really enjoyed this museum.We can recommand it to everyone who loves movies and Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tina-Magling
40,Interesting,"We really enjoyed finding out about Max Factor and Hollywood in the early days. Lots of photos, costumes and signatures. Loved the early Batman memorabilia and Silence if the Lambs set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971louisep
50,4 floors of fun and info!,"Spent my birthday celebrating in Hollywood. Heard about this place and thought, why not. Why not indeed, it is absolutely a must see for those who appreciate all the work it took to make Hollywood what it is today. Four floors of facts, costumes, photos and even the Batmobile is there! Downstairs is the chamber of horrors. Time goes quickly by when you are there. So look for the statue of Marilyn outside, go in, you'll be happy you took the time to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artfulbella
30,Fun but More for adults,We went as part of a trip to Hollywood. There was a lot to see here. We only had a short amount of time but you definitely need to spend a lot of time here. I would recommend this for older people as my kids weren't that impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberleeB926
50,A nostalgia trip...,"Even if you're not a particular film buff, this really is a superb museum with so much to see.It is in the old Max Factor offices, a historically interesting building in it's own right.Inside is a bit like the tardis, it's a lot larger than it appears and the range and quantity of items on view is huge and covers all genres of the film industry.To top off a fascinating visit, they have a set from my favourite film - It's a Mad Mad Mad World -brilliant!We paid $24 for two oldies - excellent value.Thoroughly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathank7
50,So much to see!,"The Hollywood museum has an incredible variety of material on display, spread over 4 levels. We got engrossed in the stories of old Hollywood on the ground level, not leaving enough time for the basement (horror) and two upper levels which have great displays of costumes and special effects.You will get the most out of your visit if you have time to read, but there's plenty of audiovisual displays as well. Most material is behind glass, so it's not really tactile enough to keep young children occupied. Best suited to teens and adults in my opinion.Entry is inexpensive for the value you get, which is not something you say very often about LA! We really enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Injinear
30,Exhibits need updating,"For moves buffs/historians this is the place to go. However, my teen daughter did not enjoy it as there were VERY few modern day movies featured. Adults would likely enjoy it more but if your $ are limited, this might be the attraction to skip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCgirlatheart1
50,A Must do visit,"I really enjoyed wandering through this museum, I learnt a lot about Hollywood stars of the past. I Highly recommend go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helsie111

50,Reel Memories!,"We found this museum totally by accident, what a find! It is in the old Max Factor building and is 4 floors of pure fun. There are so many costumes & so much memorabilia. We had tickets for Jimmy Kimmel, so we had to rush through more quickly than we would have liked. Definitely put it on your Hollywood to do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtarheelstate
50,This was a BLAST!,"On our 1st day in Hollywood, I knew this was the place I wanted to visit the most. Why? Because there was this special exhibition for the BATMAN '66! I just couldn't wait to see everything, and I did! There is so much more to this museum though! 3 floors of amazing costumes and memorabilia of so many moments from our past, from shows and people we grew up with and adore! If it was up to me, I would have stayed all day there! When you go to Hollywood, you have to plan ahead to make sure you don't miss anything and this place is a MUST! After being a kid again with all the Batman 66' stuff, like food for the eyes, we went down to see the Marilyn Monroe exhibition, but was surprised to see much more and souvenirs from past shows I did now expect! The last floor (in the basement) was the horror section, and it was also great! So much to see to take a full 3 hours if you're a movie or tv buff! You will appreciate every moment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie
40,Raining day activity,"We were visiting my son in LA and there was I characteristic driving rain for 2 days. What to do? I found the Hollywood Museum on trip adviser.It is a little worn, and at first felt a little kitch but after 90 minutes our group of 4 adults left very happy. Displays on first floor document ‘the golden days’ of Hollywood. They would not be familiar to younger people. However the remainder of the museum had displays from the 1960s to present. It was light and fun. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mart49506

50,The best place to start your LA experience,"This historic building houses such an extensive collection of Hollywood memorabilia. My favourites were the makeup rooms of the gorgeous leading ladies of yesteryear and the horror section in the basement.

50,"Start here, checks all you travel boxes","This is such a gem of history. You can spend days, lots of money but visit Max Factor and you'll see Hollywood history at it's best. It even has a reward after your time in the museum...Mel's diner is connected and it has the BEST burgers in the area for a great price! Reviews for the parking next door aren't great but if you want to keep it simple and safe, go for it. Love this venue, nice lady up front, full on information. A+++",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wapenaz
50,Best Attraction in Hollywood,"This Museum was the original headquarters for Max Factor, the legendary cosmetic icon for the Hollywood stars. This Museum is 3 stories of authentic artifacts and sets for both movies and television. This a ""Don't Miss"" in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeannem52
30,For hard-core movie (and TV) fans,"I paid $15 admission fee. You get 3 floors of exhibits of movie and TV costumes, mock-ups, props, etc. The upper floors have so much stuff back to back that the exhibits come across as ""clutter"" more so than ""showcase"". So I get the vibe of the place being an ""attic"" or ""closet"" of an actor or collector, more so than a clean and neat showcase. While I don't care for costumes (women's dresses) as Hollywood history, I do think their Alien/Horror floor was particularly good, and worthwhile. There is nearly no descriptions beyond a name plate, so you don't get much of a history lesson. So while the ""design"" of the exhibits is poor (crammed together), certainly the quantity is very high, very densely packed. They feature their Batman (TV) exhibit, which was modest but pleasing. They feature Max Factor's makeup technology, which did not interest me (a man).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimgR975BH
50,Hollywood Nostalgia,"Take a walk down memory lane as you immerse yourself in 4 floors of Hollywood history.

Best museum in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_maka1620
30,Hollywood Museum,"This museum is located in the old Max Factor building and as such it has a large display about make up used in film and television. Beyond that, there are many pieces of film and TV memorabilia on display over three floors including a couple of famous cars from ‘50s and ‘60s TV. The collection is certainly worth a look, if you have a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericw824
50,Great place to visit in Hollywood,"Looking for a place in LA to kill a few hours and stumbled across the Hollywood Museum. Glad we did. It was very enjoyable, entertaining, and interesting.Old building which has its own charm but the exhibits were great. Take a walk through movie and TV history. At $15 a person (adult) thought it was a good value for the two plus hours we spent there. Not sure if it is kid friendly as most of the stuff there will appeal to those of us maybe 35-40 plus (or even more to 50+ like us).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psianojr
50,Hidden Gem full of Classic Hollywood History,I found this amazing little Gem while looking for things close to the hotel I was staying in. €20 well spent! 4 floors of Classic Hollywood Film History with the Basement being The Horror side! I didn’t spend too long down there due to being a scaredy cat but all floors were fantastic. Only open 10am- 5pm and closes on Sundays but make sure you make time if your into old Hollywood especially.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgentCharlieb
40,This museum kind of grows on you,"We enjoyed our foray to the Hollywood Museum in the old Max Factor Building in Hollywood. The main floor has hundreds of framed photos of various stars, mostly from the 19302-1950s, as well as displays about Marilyn Monroe and other prominent stars. The second floor is all about movie monsters, with some great monsters on display, such as Predator, Aliens, etc. The next floor up is devoted to Batman. The basement (of course) is devoted to ghouls of various ilk, such as Hannibal the Cannibal, but also Elvira, and others. It would be easy to pass this museum off as kitschy, but it's actually better than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
30,Okay,"People are friendly and the price to get in is inexpensive - - that's positive. The first floor was of the most interest to me since it has a ton of old Hollywood photos, both locations and actors/actresses. The upper floors have costumes and props, most of which from more current movies and shows. If you are looking for a way to fill your time and you are already in the area, might be worth a quick stop (1 hr is likely all that is needed unless you will look closely at every picture on the first floor. If so, probably 1.5 - 2 hrs). Otherwise I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it. Park at the meter spots too instead of a lot if you can, as they are much cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyj466
40,Dry interesting visit,"We visited Hollywood to see the Walk of Fame and Madame Tussaud’s, both of which were underwhelming and completed in a quarter of the anticipated time. We therefore decided to visit the Hollywood Museum which was a fascination peak into the golden age of this entertainment capitol of the world. On displays are actual props used in many well known productions and personal effects of the stars of yesterday. This made our visit to the grubby district of Hollywood worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCDC
50,Must go,"Lot of clothes and objects from various cinema eras, and it worthy spending some time in this museum. What I liked most was the exhibition of the first series Batman (Adam West). When I was a child I loved the series and it was awsome to see the costumes, the batmobile and toys of that time.It also has an horror section on the underground. It is really creepy.It was an great expirience to show a little bit more of the cinema that I used to see to my kids .GO LA Card is accepted here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioCanedo

The museum seems to be a mish-mash of Hollywood from 40's to the 70's. There's really no flow to it and the lighting could be better. The first floor is all Max Factor and his effect on Hollywood makeup. The basement is all horror. The top floor is stuff from the 60's and 70's. If you're not into the older movies and TV, then don't go. If you have problems with stairs, there is an elevator, but you have to ask.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alpw
50,Old Hollywood,"I loved it here, so many fascinating exhibits.There was so much about Hollywood's greatest stars when Hollywood was magical. Plenty of photographs and information. Also most of the popular TV series were featured from 'The Beverly Hillbillies' to 'Madmen'. A great section on Max Factor and his make-up and a horror film floor in the basement. Well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3610DQdeborahs
50,Fascinating shambles,Excellent pile of stuff from Old Hollywood and early Max Factor (the building was owned by Max Factor). Not so much for fans of films after about 1970.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippadina2
50,GOOD TIME,I really liked this place. It was better than I anticipated. Takes about 1-2 hours. Plenty to look at. Not wheel chair accessible. Would do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234normal
30,For over 55,Marilyn Monroe and all celebrities that are of no interests to teens. Old 1940-60 films. 1st Batman & Robin movies + costumes. It can be appreciated by those born in the 50s. $15 per adults. 3 floors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyDayton_Ohio
40,A hidden gem,"If you’re someone who appreciates Hollywood’s history, then this is definitely a great walkthrough. It’s not interactive, but you’ll definitely get an eyeful of cinematic... everything. Definitely worth going through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birdy422
50,Loved This Place,"For a nominal cost, you can see a ton of Hollywood history and artifacts. There is a broad range covered, plenty for parents and kids alike. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. If you are visiting L.A., you need to add this to your itinerary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveSedberry
50,Loved It,"From the outside, well, it needs a bit more ""COME IN""In fact, it was only because of the Tripadvisor reviews, I had this down as a ""must do""It certainly did not disapoint.tI really is fabulous value for money.Four floors of Hollywood history. and the Batman stuff was my icing on the cake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glasgowbigyin01
50,great place to spend a few hours,"This is a great place to spend a few hours we have been twice & enjoyed every minute of it, must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57chevycustom
50,"Great way to beat the heat, especially at this price!","My girlfriend and I visited in the middle of June as the temperatures started to heat up. We were on Hollywood Blvd early in the morning and were able to beat most of the crowds, however this was a nice break from everything else. Lots of genuine props from both TV and movies that all ages can appreciate.The horror movie basement was really great too! Such a fun way to spend a few hours and see some genuine pieces of Hollywood. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Hollywood Blvd, especially if you are a movie or TV buff. This price is hard to beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasZach
40,Must see for old Hollywood buffs,"The building is beautiful, the exhibits are very well presented and interesting, The contribution of Max Factor to the makeup industry is amazing. We have been on the Paramount studio tour and this is as good if not better than their costume department.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stpattysday17
50,Best Part of LA!,"Our experience with downtown LA was fairly disappointing, and The Hollywood Museum really stands out as the redeeming experience of the whole thing! It is filled to the brim with fun movie props, costumes, and authentic make-up collections of old Hollywood stars. Set in a historic building where all the actresses used to come get their hair and makeup done, there truly is a vibrant energy inside. There is something here for everyone, whether you love old Hollywood or new. Plus, with rotating exhibits, there is something you're sure to enjoy. I was especially excited to see the temporary Annette Funicello exhibit, as I'm a huge fan. My husband's favorite part was seeing Hannibal Lector's actual jail cell in the downstairs Horror exhibit. My husband was also in a wheelchair and they were very accommodating. All in all, we definitely recommend with high praises!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriamjean
50,Out of Towner,"I think this museum was one of the most enjoyable attractions in Los Angeles. I didn't particularly like the city with it's infernal traffic and crowds, but I'm glad I at least manage to visit this little gem. Though, I thought they had waaay too many Marylin Monroe memorabilia and unfortunately no Audrey Hepburn stuff :(. All in all it was a lovely place to visit if you love films like I do. 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Medusas-coil
50,Best $12 Spent in LA!,"This is a real hidden gem in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard. Spent a very interesting couple of hours here. Do not be put off by the rather inauspicious entrance way, it really does contain a lot of interesting displays. Scary stuff in the basement to Batman on the third floor. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wizzo2016
40,Lots to look at here,"The admission is $15 for an adult for 4 floors of TV and movie memorabilia. The Batman exhibit is definitely the biggest although the first floor includes the four make-up rooms that are color coded by hair color. The dungeon is filled with the horror movie sets, costumes and props and it is definitely creepy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture465502
40,"Quirky, Sometimes Kitschy, but Always Entertaining Museum","If you love movies or make up then this is definitely a museum to visit. Originally the Max Factor make up headquarters, the museum has preserved and explained the ""science"" (read: marketing) behind the early make up industry on the first floor. The basement pays homage to horror movies and the top floor is a fun gemisch of Hollywood memorabilia across the decades. Whatever age you are, you'll find movie props, costumes or facts that bring back memories. Very fun and doable in less than 2 hours, depending on how much of a fan you are. Admission is included in the 3-Day LA Go Card, which is a great value!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Workingindymom
50,A Nice Surprise,"We honestly didn't know what to expect. However, we found this to be a hidden gem filled with great memorabilia of the good old Hollywood days. I sat through the short film on Max Factor, while my boys enjoyed the ground floor filled with all the scary life sized characters (think Halloween, Alien, etc). The second floor was a favorite for my family. It's filled with the original Batman and other great memorabilia from the 1960's era. I recommend you not overlook this tour and when you leave go through the side door right into Mel's Drive-In Diner and enjoy a burger and fries :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558marisolo
50,Hollywood History and then some.,My second time there and I recon that I still didn't see it all as there is so much to see. They had the 60's Batman and Robin exhibit on and bought back a lot of memories from watching it as a kid. Will have to check it out again. Highly recommend going down stairs last and staying down there for a while to check out all the horror movie exhibits. Will go there again for sure.Cheers Brett from Hastings Point Australia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettSOk68
40,Interesting Museum,Great museum over 4 floors with some great items. We went for the Batman special collection which was amazing and brought back so many childhood memories. Staff are friendly and helpful. Well worth the entry fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavinC
40,Recommened,I took a quick glance at the museum using my go card. We were not sure what to do that day but decided to go in. It was nice it shows you a lot of Hollywood's history and the costumes that actors and actresses used to wear. This place is recommended for those who are interested in the early days of Hollywood and Hollywood before the millennium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sauditraveller
30,Some Good Items,"I’m a big movie buff but was a bit disappointed with this museum. They do have some nice pieces so it is well worth a visit, just don’t have high expectations like I did. I am even a big Batman fan and, again, was a little disappointed with the special Batman show. Again, there are some good items that make it worth the visit but it is entirely focused on the 60’s TV show.Lots to do in the neighbourhood as you right off Hollywood Blvd. & the Walk Of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
40,History,If you are a lover of nostalgic items this is definitely the place for you. Lots of really neat things to look at. There’s a lot of old Batman and comic book stuff. The story behind the wall of fame. If you love scary movies there is a part of the exhibition just for that. Definitely a great way to spend the afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478dawna
50,Fun way to spend an afternoon,"We saw in the news they had just added the batman exhibit so we decided to venture there for the afternoon!! The museum had so many great items on display of the history of Hollywood movies, tv, and actors! When we were touring the floor of the batman exhibit we ran into the original ""Robin"" Burt ward!! That was a cool bonus!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendabD7964AG
50,highly recommend !!!,"I highly recommend this museum. It’s in the old Max Factor building and this place is huge. Only $15.00 admission. So much to see. I went while the Batman 66 exhibit was there. Just incredible. Everything was displayed great, even the batmobile was there. Allow plenty of time to really see everything. There are 3 floors with so much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Props555
40,very interesting and worth the trip,"We had coupons from our hotel for $2.00 off so that was a good start. The place has so much to see and lots of pictures and posters. There is a dungeon they call it downstairs with lots of the scary movie displays. They have televisions showing in several of the display cases of lots of the shows making you remember some of the old shows you might have grown up watching. Lots of info on Marilyn Munroe, Batman and Robyn, Clint Eastwood just to name a few celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CubaqueenOntario
40,Gobs and gobs of Memorabilia,"This is housed in the old Max Factor building and much of the first floor is devoted to making up the artists. The rest id devoted to stars of the past and present. There are 4 floors here and just a plethora of memorabilia from playbills to cars, to autographed pictures to holsters, to dresses and suits. Stars of TV and movies are represented here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
50,Holy Great Batman 66 exhibit !,What an amazing display of the original Batman props and costumes . Had the car and motorcycle from the show ! Parking nearby for $10 and Hollywood Blvd right around the corner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,Unexpectedly fun,"Honestly didn't expect to like this place so much... I felt almost like if we didn't come here, we may have not experienced how Hollywood has become, from Marilyn Monroe's make-up set to costumes, to costumes from Harry Potter, and even drama series like The Good Wife. This place will appeal to anyone, and the fearless can look at the creepier stuff like Hannibal Rising in the basement. For just USD 15, this was a great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summersbea
40,Make time for a visit,"Surprisingly, this museum is filled with 4 stories of very interesting memorabilia. In particular, Marilyn Monroe's clothing, photos, even her prescription pill bottle is in here. Max Factor had special make-up for women deepening on their hair color and you can visit each room. If you love movies and TV, then visit. You will see Pee Wee's bicycle from PW Big Adventure, ruby slippers from Wizard of Oz, the car from The Beverly Hillbillies, Laurel and Hardy history, Shirley Temple's outfits, Lucy's Emmy statues, a room from Silence of the Lambs, Rocky's robe, Michael Jackson's outfit. Even a tribute to the Hal Roach era of The Little Rascals is on view. I live in L.A. and never had an interest until I read interesting reviews and it was worth my time. The building is really old and in desperate need of freshening up but just ignore it and enjoy the displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hildmat
40,Max Factor Building is the Hollywood Museum!,"This is a must place visit for locals and visitors alike! My favorite room had to be of I Love Lucy and the artifacts from the set! The vintage TV replica played a loop of ""vitameatavegamin"" and boy was it funny to watch! No matter how old that clip/show was and no matter how many times you have seen it, the laugh never wears off! This is a great place to learn the evolution of film and of make-up. Couple this visit to the Wax Museum and you will feel like a Hollywood A-List Film Buff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherF2352
50,Cool Exhibits,"This place is just packed with recent and historic Hollywood memorabilia. Everything from make-up, costumes, posters, including audio and visual recordings. Make sure to check out the ""dungeon"" for horror film buffs and upstairs for Marilyn Monroe. We've been here several times and there is always something new to see. Definitely not geared for very young children, but adults and teens will really enjoy it. Be sure to double check the hours so you have time to take your time and see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I5228NQjoyceb
50,Nananananananana Nananananananana Batman!,"Just went to the Hollywood Museum for the first time for the opening reception of their Batman 66 exhibit! What a wonderfully curated exhibition! House in the old Max Factor building, the museum is a lesson in Hollywood history! Original props spanning all of Hollywood from golden age to present , retro make-up rooms, costuming, autograph room and a horror room perfectly placed in the dungeon (basement)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1245TSbarbaram
50,Surprisingly amazing,One of the beat attraction in Hollywood. This museum is a very history on Cinema. Must see for Cinema lovers. Very recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrvgago
40,"An eclectic, odd, & bizarre mish-mash of things that are just so ""Hollywood""....","The main floor is devoted to Max Factor and those ""stars""--particularly Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball--who had something to do w/ the make-up as is fitting as the musuem is located in the former Max Factor building. The rest of that floor is taken up w/ odds and ends of movie paraphenalia, autographs, pictures, &c of stars, theaters, events past and present. Upstairs is more ""stuff""--primarily from television--including the car/truck used in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", various wardrobes fr/ television shows, and more paraphenlia. Downstairs is devoted to the horror genre w/ the set fr/ ""Silence of the Lambs"" and assorted items fr/ horror movies of all periods.The place is eclectic, odd, & bizarre and great fun.Do beware of the parking scam next door as the attendante will lie to you about how much it will cost to park your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tencatdaddy
40,A LOOK BACK AT THE OLD HOLLYWOOD,"The last time we were here we tried to go but it was the early part of the week and they are closed. In a town that has produced a lot of history, they don't seem very interested in preserving it. This is one of the few places where you can see the old Hollywood.Plus you get to see it all in the old Max Factor factory. Women wear makeup today because of what Max Factor did for the movie industry in it's infancy.If you care about the past, take your time and enjoy this museum. See if you can spot the error I found. There is a photo of John Garfield and John Houston and John Houston is misidentified as his father Walter Houston.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skip59716
40,Magical Insite!,Into the world of Max Factor and several of the actors that his make up made. Interesting exhibits and stories for all to enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riskm
50,Max Factor Museum; Who Knew?,"If you love the Golden Days of Hollywood, you will love this museum located in the old Max Factor building in the heart of Hollywood. The most interesting aspect of the museum is the history of Max Factor and the development of make up for the stars of old Hollywood. (Don’t worry there is enough history for a guy to enjoy too.) There are many old photographs of Los Angeles, particularly those in the area where stars eat and lived.Don’t miss the movie which describes the full history of the man and all he accomplished.Upstairs are TV and movie exhibits that are more current. There is a “horror room” too.I have lived in LA many years and wonder why I had never been here before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nellie5
50,Surprisingly Awesome!,"I don’t know why, but I didn’t have high hopes for this place. That said, it completely exceeded my expectations. It includes tons of stuff from both the golden age of Hollywood and from modern film and TV. This museum is fantastic! All of it is well organized and easy to view and the building itself is also historic and fascinating. I highly recommend this museum to any entertainment fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatElena
40,Hollywood Treasures,"Large exhibit and film about Max Factor and the history of make-up, Originally the building was the Max Factor factory. Special rooms dedicated to certain stars,Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball, etc. Lots of clothing and paraphenalia from Hollywood movies and TV shows. Spooky basement. It is a fun adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1924OObarbarar
50,Wow,First of all I only saw this place by walking past it with all the wax museums I didn’t actually think of visiting a real museum !!I loved it ..it was REAL old Hollywood the props were old and they have a scary part which is scary !!It’s in the old max factor building that the studios would send the stars to get there hair and make up done !! It felt a little creepy in there like I could feel years of history just walking around but I loved it !!The lady at the counter was so lovely I really wanna go back and visit again !! If old Hollywood is your thing go here !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364kylieh
30,This place freaked me out,"I don't know if it was the way this place is decorated, or the smell, or just that all the stuff in there is really old and from mostly dead people. It was very creepy in there, it was interesting, we had a pass for this place so I am glad we didn't pay full price, some cool stuff though. We were in a our in an hour, so good for killing time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationjunkie2387
50,Favorite Museum!!!,Loved this place and was so sad to leave. Forced out by my husband. This place is packed with old Hollywood treasures. I loved the individual rooms suited best based on hair color. Can't wait to go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsaywk
40,Part of the story of hollywood,"Okay having read the reviews about the smell of this place I knew what to expect. It is a very old building and yes it does smell fusty. You Wil live.Plenty of stairs too.What did I love... It brought back so many memories from my childhood, laurel and hardy, the stars from the great old movies, planet of the Apes original characters, the photo gallery of stars, memorabilia from the hunger games and Jurassic park. Compared in price to other Hollywood attractions this was reasonable.No cafe or earphones, which would have enriched the experience . My 15 year old enjoyed it too, which surprised me.call me old fashion, it's a glimpse of another world and time, relax and enjoy that feeling as a child when you watched the LIttle house on the Prairie or or if you are a horror movie fan, the set from silence of the lambs and Frankenstein...the short film on the history of the building is interesting especially if you have a daughter who loves Smashbox products.My husband would have liked to have seen John WAyne but apparently the memorabilia at auction is out of the reach of the museum and it does not come on to auction often.... We can hope some kind philanthropist will donate some memorabilia to share with the rest of the world, films give us all so much pleasure, just for a few hours to escape the drudgery of every day life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edinburghcitymom
50,Fun way to spend an afternoon with out of town guests,Wonderful museum with many artifacts and memorabilia from Hollywood's past and present!Took our German exchange student and daughters and they had a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauriepaz
50,One of my favorite stops,"I stumbled upon this museum unknowingly and decided to kill some time and give it a shot. I almost didn't believe they had all these ""props"" so I didn't expect much. Well, I was blown away! In fact every time I am in LA I make sure to stop by again because I loved it so much. The building is historic, and really cool on it's own. They have multiple levels of props and scripts and pretty much everything old Hollywood. It's like a time capsule that will transport you into another era. It truly is a gem of Hollywood, I would go back in a second. Don't miss this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElvishThistle
50,"Fabulous Darling, Simply Fabulous","If you ever want to see the Old Max Factor Building and gain an insight to the World of Old Hollywood, this place is a must see.4 floors of memorabilia all painstakingly put together and loads for the ladies to see. Thank you to the wonderful woman at the front desk, you were amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eddy2764
40,Excellent if You Have City Pass,"We had the Go L.A. Pass, and this was one of the 30+ places included. Since we were in the area for the day, we tried to knock out as much as possible with what was included. This was a unique property with a lot of celebrity exhibits and memorabilia across 4 floors. I thought the basement ""horror movie"" exhibits were interesting, despite I do not like that genre. There was a nice mix of old timers as well as recent Hollywood history.I am not sure what this place costs without the city pass, but if you have it I would recommend you stop by. It took us a little over an hour as a couple without kids to go through it all. However, you could easily spend a few hours here if you read every little detail. There had to be hundreds if not thousands of pictures alone along the walls of L.A. and old Hollywood stars and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,Really great find. Best 'Hollywood' museum collection,"Several floors of old movie props, costumes, and makeup. This is in the original Max Factor building and several of the rooms that were used for different 'color' types are still there. You can get thru in an hour if you push, but I'd suggest allowing a couple hours - so much interesting stuff there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdcifuen
30,A lot of costumes,"Almost the whole exhibition is concentrated about costumes. If you're not interested in costumes, you can see som props from Star Wars, Cocoon and some other stuff. But ok. The museum tells some of the Hollywood history. And if you're a serious fan of Hollywood and especially the older Hollywood - then this is a must.In the cellar you find a full setup from the Silence Of The Lambs - Hannibal Lector cell. Very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikkiDenmark
50,Best Museum in Hollywood,"The Hollywood Museum has everything from everyone - props from the Silent era, Golden Age right through to today!I love the Silent and Golden Age and they had it all for me - lot of floors of props, costumes, photos, cars and so much more,Underated and you have to visit if you are a movie fan!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DieselIE
40,Great golden-age memorabilia,"Very good, particularly if you are into make-up and the pre 1970s era. Overall a good experience with a wide range of memorabilia, mostly from film but also some US tv too.Over several floors in the old max factor building and many areas still look and feel as they would in the 40s 50s and 60s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I157DBstevet
40,Interesting exhibits,"The museum is 4 floors, but it only took us an hour to go through it all. There are a lot of different decades represented, and there are many props to look at that are reminders of some great movies. The lower floor is full of scary props and monster models, so I would not recommend that area for small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebStr2016
30,Unique Museum--lots of memorabilia,This is an affordable museum to visit while in the West Hollywood area. It is filled with memorabilia from Old Hollywood and some stuff from more recent Hollywood as well. You can buy a ticket to this at a discount through the Los Angeles Go Card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinedm23
30,What maked this Museum unique is the location,"This museum is located in the Max Factor building, ""Make up artist of the Stars"". The first floor features ""colour rooms"" for makeup application based on hair colour. The two upper floors have all kinds of interesting Hollywood Memorabilia. This is a recommended visit, albeit somewhat pricey if one is interested in Hollywood movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879loria
50,A hidden gem,"I had never heard of this museum - and the street it's on is surrounded by car parks - so I almost missed it. I'm so glad I went.The ground floor is all Golden Age of Hollywood glamour. If you like 50s and 60s Hollywood, or Marilyn Monroe, you'll love it. I don't know much about that era at all but even I felt a lump in my throat.There's also a huge exhibit of a wide range of costumes from film and TV.But the best part - and maybe the best part of my whole LA trip - was the dungeon. You can see Hannibal Lecter's cell and sit in Clarice's little plastic chair. The museum was quite quiet so you can really soak in the atmosphere.I even got in half price because of the bus tours I'd been on that day.Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O9761UItimr
30,Not worth it if you don't have a city pass!!,"The smell in there is horrible. It smells like the basement of your great great great grand parents home. Everything smelled old in there. It would help them if they rearranged the exhibits the initial exhibits are just okay. As you go on, it gets better much better. However, I would not pay for this if I did not have my City Pass!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendita
40,Fascinating exhibits,Has a really interesting collection of costumes and items that belonged to the old stars of Hollywood. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo
40,Great for Hollywood/Film/TV Buffs,"This museum is a hidden gem, featuring loads of memorabilia from the Golden Age of Hollywood up through today, covering film, TV, and more. It's inexpensive and great place to gaze for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
40,Museum in the old Max Factor Building,"Interesting exhibits from the ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood. Significant space is devoted to Max Factor and his son and the history of Hollywood screen make-up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UpstateNYBirder
40,Worth a visit!,"Enjoyable time at this museum containing original props, costumes, make-up, wigs, autographs, and even cars (the Beverly Hillbillies car as well as two movie stars' cars). We thought it was going to be hokey but were pleasantly surprised. Spent about 60-70 minutes with a teen. Something for teens and up -- from Hollywood glamour to horror. A must if you are a Silence of the Lambs fan as it contains the entire cell block where we had fun replicating the scene where Clarice meets Dr. Lecter. They had the dog in a body cast from Something About Mary, Lily Tomlin's Laugh-in rocking chair, costumes from Orange is the New Black, Marilyn Monroe jewels and dresses, and so much more on 4 floors. Both teens and grandparents alike would find elements of interest. Not recommended for younger children. Stairs were a bit steep. Not sure if there is an elevator to get to the various floors. And some exhibits were not identified which was a bit frustrating. But still glad we went. Eat at Mel's Diner next door -- they are even connected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
50,The absolute best,"This is a very affordable and entirely wonderful slice of Hollywood. Don't leave Hollywood without going. Allow 2 hours. The exhibits are arranged over four floors. The ground floor is the golden age of Hollywood - all the Max Factor make up swatches, dresses worn to premieres and for iconic roles and so forth. Also a film about the creation of Max Factor (old but good) and various bits of Hollywood memorabilia from the beginnings of the movie industry. Dotted across the upper two floors are props, costumes, stills and insights into decades of film and TV. In some places it's a bit higgledy piggledy but all great stuff. Downstairs in the basement is the horror section. The lady who greeted us was lovely - and the whole place is just fascinating. Full of unique insights and amazing Hollywood history. And it costs about $12.50 a head - if you're a movie fan, you won't find anything better. We all agreed it was a highlight of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanies15
50,The Golden Era of the Movies,"If you're a movie buff, this is an essential visit for you! Forget the overpriced wax musuem. This museum is packed with photos and artifacts of the real stars of Hollywood. Amazing!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
30,Works Best for Older Tourists,"We viewed the Hollywood Museum on a Saturday afternoon & it wasn't too crowded. The exhibits and building were fairly old & requires walking up stairs. We did enjoy reading about and viewing information on stars that interested us, so movie buffs will enjoy this museum. We heard many foreign language speakers in the museum, and younger people as well, so it must have a broad appeal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII
50,"Old Hollywood, New Hollywood in an Iconic building.","This was the Max Factor building. Lucy went here for her makeup. So did everyone else. See Dorothy's slippers from the Wizard of Oz. Hannibal Lecter's cell. On 4 floors, leave enough time. You'll need it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imorr55
50,Great value for money,"The amount of original material on display is amazing, dating back over many decades.Four floors to visit and lots to see then visit the diner next door the food is superb",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835allans
50,LOVED IT ALL,"So much to see for all those loving Hollywood history. Amazing displays, loads of costumes, photos and film reel to bring it to life. Could have spent all day there.. go and see it. Entry price affordable for such a diverse showcase. Also didn't know Max Factor was the father of make up and today's techniques...learnt so much...Again take some time and go and see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelesh18
50,The genuine Hollywood museum,"We asked the hotel staff to recommend a place to visit and this was their pick.It is a genuine museum and tells the story of the beginning and heyday of Hollywood with many genuine mementos.Even the building is part of the visit as it was the original Max Factor factory and make up creation studio for the stars as the industry battled to develop products suitable for the new ""colour"" films. Check out the kissing machine.The cost is a fraction of the more famous exhibits and we happily spent several hours browsing which did include actually reading the informative displays. (We got a pass out and returned later.)Stairs to the upper floor or use the original industrial elevator and a scary basement with all the cobwebs and villains you could want.And you may well come away wishing you had met the one and only MM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerl044
40,Eclectic collection,"It doesn't take long to go through, but there is a lot of cool props and costumes to see. From years ago to current past. Things like coffins from True Blood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debsW3024QA
40,Quick Stop,Great to see memorabilia. Convenient down the street for Hollywood Blvd. Eat Next store first. Parking difficult,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinar121
50,Do not miss this Museum,"Located in the heart of Hollywood in a fantastic building which was once Max Factor's. See the original Max Factor rooms on the ground floor. Huge array of Hollywood & LA memorabilia on all the floors, lots of photographs to take for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelag125
50,So Much Hollywood History!,"Please visit this awesome museum. It had so much history and so many exhibits! From the outside, you wouldn't think there'd be so much inside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnews0me
50,Awesome place that you must see if in Los Angeles,This is a stunning museum of both today and yesterday Hollywood. Fantastic pieces from all eras of the movie and television industry. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the exhibits and programs. You must go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanthetripMan
40,Great if you're into Hollywood memorabilia,The museum had lots and lots of interesting artifacts of Hollywood and even some modern TV and movie exhibits. I thouht the most interesting part of the whole thing was the movie on Max Factor on the first floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps804493
30,Fans of old school Hollywood,"The first floor of the museum was definitely the most interesting as it included the 4 different makeup rooms for the different hair colors. Fans of old school Hollywood would probably enjoy this more than we did, as we don't know much about this era of movies/TV. The rest of the museum seemed like an odd hodge podge of collections of various and random TV shows and movies props and costumes. Purchased through the LA GO card. Not sure I would have visited without having that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J422DLlaurat
50,Worth a visit!,"Lots of artifcats dating back from early 20th century - it has three leveks: one of them are orginal make-up rooms for stars (the museum is in an old Max Factor building), the second is with original movie costumes and other movie artificats, and teh third is a horror movie level, with props from thrillers, including the prison film setting from the Silence of the Lambs. Loves it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdeI21
50,Much better than I expected!,"I live near this museum, but never went because it didn't look interesting. When I had friends visiting who were looking for something to do in Hollywood, we decided to check it out. I am glad we did!My favorite part was the documentary about Max Factor. It was truly fascinating. I had no idea what a pioneer Max Factor was. Nor did I understand all of the movie industry needs regarding make-up. I would recommend this museum to anyone who is interested in Hollywood history. Not just people who are interested in make-up.The museum was quite large, and had many exhibits that didn't have anything to do with Max Factor or make-up. In fact there was so much there, we only saw the first floor. I wish I had budgeted more time. I definitely plan to go back and see the rest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/in0r
40,Lots to see! Loved it!,This museum is in the old Max Factor Building on Highland Ave. in the heart of Hollywood. It's a self-guided tour with oh so much to see. It really can't be done in one visit if you are interested in old Hollywood and the stars of her heyday. I focused on the Max Factor history which is incredibly interesting. Max Factor practically invented make-up and certainly did invent many of the techniques in movie make-up. There were a few videos on different facets of his career. Other items are memorabilia from movies and hundreds of pictures. One entire room was covered with historic pics. There just wasn't time to see it all. There is Mel's Diner attached to the museum and you can come back after having a bite to eat. Some of our party did that. The parking lot is right next to the building. With validation from Mel's Diner you get some savings. The museum also validates but the savings is smaller. I have to warn you that this is not a pristinely curated museum. It could be called downright shabby; but it's a lot of fun and really brought back memories of my youth. Love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
50,Max Factor - There's a lot more to it than just a brand name,"Max Factor - There's a lot more to it than just a brand name for cosmetics. This museum is in the historic Max Factor building, and highlights (among other things) the development of cosmetics as used in the film and TV industries. Why this mattered is that as the technology of movie film, lighting, and cameras changed and advanced, it became necessary for actors and actresses to wear different makeup so as to ""look right"" on the Silver Screen. Here's where you can find out all about it. I didn't have many expectations when we stopped in, but as it turned out we stayed until closing....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00
40,Good collection,"The museum is housed in the historic Max Factor building. The main floor is given over to the various makeup rooms, with a section devoted to science fiction and another full of pictures and autographs. The basement is full of monsters (with a few random films thrown in the mix like Master and Commander and Alexander). The top two floors are a mashup of just about every other era and genre of film. I understand most people are probably more excited by modern films that are easy to recognize, but I was slightly disappointed to find that there seemed to be more modern pieces in the collection than classic pieces. Overall, it was a large, varied collection that was displayed well, with several videos throughout the building to explain what you're seeing, or show it in use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
50,Surprising piece of history,"We were wandering around the touristic part of Hollywood when we spotted this place. Since we like quirky little museums, we went in and were glad we did.It's the old Max Factor building, and you start out learning a lot about the modern evolution of makeup, which is more interesting than you'd think. See the different rooms decorated to flatter redheads, blondes, brunettes, brownettes (did you know that was a thing?).But then it diverges, going everywhere from Dorothy's slippers to Hannibal's mask. And autographs. Lots of autographs. A fun couple of hours, longer if you are an old Hollywood buff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindanLV
30,Lot of artefacts but not very interesting,This museum is located on the Hollywood Boulevard and has 3 floors of artefacts related to Hollywood primarily the props and the costumes used in movies. We not being such being movie buffs found it very uninteresting. Can we worth a visit if you are interested in looking at pieces used in the movies,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,Enjoyable!,We enjoyed walking through the displays. Good activity for a family as you have time - taking tours etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegasrob
50,Quirky But Interesting!,"Over four colourful floors, you will discover a wide range of fascinating memorabilia – from a genuine Silence of the Lambs set to the genie bottle from I Dream of Jeannie! This museum is stuffed full of artefacts and costumes – everywhere you look is another amazing or odd surprise. The museum is located in the Max Factor Building, and there are some makeup rooms left set up as they would have been during Max Factor's time – including a redhead room and a blonde room. This is definitely a must-visit for anyone who loves the history of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
40,This is an interesting and fun place to visit,"This place is very chill and the woman who operates it is friendly, knowledgable and not some crazy Hollywood cook. She is just into Hollywood stuff and transmits that with her enthusiasm. She also let us store our luggage in a closet while we walked around. How nice!The stuff you get to see about make-up and the history of cosmetics in Hollywood is really neat and they just have lots of memorabilia and exhibits that remind you of shows you have seen.At only $15 its definitely worth going to if you have 2 hours to kill and want to see an interesting slice of Hollywood history without all the bells, whistles and hoorah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewlibson
50,Great place to see movie stuff,"This was one of the coolest things we did in Hollywood. Well worth the cost of admission.Great collections of costumes, props and autographs. I thought is was cool to see autographs from Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and others from old timey Hollywood.The horror collection in the basement was spooky. Pieces from classics to new stuff.If you're in Hollywood, this museum should be on your must see list.I hope one day this collection is bigger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95dustyh
20,Good bye to a Bygone,"So sad to say this museum has run its course. They need to redo almost everything or close the doors. They have really neat collections of autographs and makeup from old movie stars! Literally whole rooms dedicated to ... Autographs in frames and make-up used on famous dead people! Most things are just so old that even a dad in his mid-forties couldn't recognize many of the names, props, and featured items. A ton of the museum is dedicated to Marilyn Monroe, which is cool, but they have a mural of her playboy shoot on the wall, larger than life, for my 10 year old to ""enjoy""? I was surprised. The basement is really creepy and dedicated to early (and some more modern) horror films if you are into that. We're not. Not worth the $15. Cool architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bromcd
40,For the old Hollywood fans!,"I really liked this museum but I'm a big old Hollywood fan! It's in a beautiful historic building for Max Factor and gives all the details of his history and how he styled the most famous starlets. The big draw is all the Monroe memorabilia for me. Also, good horror film collection and lots of more modern pieces (True Blood coffins, The Knick costumes, etc.). The third floor was in disarray as they seemed to be redoing the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyzz
50,Old Hollywood Glam!,"If you are searching for Old Hollywood this is the place. 4 hours of memorabilia . Bonus, connect to a 50's Mel's Diner with the best Milkshakes! Around the corner from all the glitz on the Sunset strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roseanned849
30,"Lots of things, interesting, but not great.","I went on an extra afternoon I had. The people were wonderful and extremely nice. The Museum had lots of interesting stuff, however was not quite what I was expecting. From what I had seen in advertisements I thought there would be more exhibits directly related to things I enjoy and had seen ads for, while there were things there for them, they were combined with lots of other things.That being said, it's a nice place to kill an hour or so with interesting things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/97linneam
40,Fun for movie and TV buffs,"My wife and enjoyed visiting this museum housed in the old Max Factor building. The Art Deco architecture is interesting to see in its own right. There's a haphazard arrangement to the presentation of movie and TV memorabilia, and the museum could use a little TLC and reorganization, but a visit is worth the price of admission ($15). The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GradingMachine
50,"I loved this museum, so much stuff from Old Hollywood!","The Hollywood Museum is a hidden gem and must-see. Where else can you stand in the very room where Max Factor dyed Marilyn Monroe's hair blonde? Besides that, there is so much memorabilia here that you will not be disappointed in the visit. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnV541
50,"Not as polished as some, but well worth a visit","The building itself could be considered a museum, which adds to the charm. It covers most all genres and time periods of Hollywood movie history. For less than $15 a person, it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrFrump
40,Trip down memory lane,"A good value attraction filled with film memorabilia. There is so much here of interest to all ages but particularly the older visitor. Everything from old TV and film clips, to costumes and props. It certainly brought back memories for us and made us want to watch some of the old movies again.There is a film charting the history of Max Factor which is well worth taking the time to watch.Refreshing to visit a traditional style museum rather than the more common high tech, interactive soulless attractions that are much more expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gadabouts95
50,Amazing for lovers of film and TV,"A friend and I were visiting from England and this was included on our GO LA cards so we decided to give it a visit. We had no expectations but it was amazing. We only got there 45 minutes before they were due to close and were the only people there, the staff were lovely and we didn't feel rushed and they let us look around even after they had closed and we never felt rushed.We were a bit scared to go down to the basement area but only because we were the only people there, plus the staff and it was creepy!Loads of Hollywood history, loved every minute of it, even scaring ourselves in the basement!Would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNT8114
40,Great place for Hollywood Enthusiasts,This place is an awesome place for movie enthusiasts. Mostly old hollywood is on display. The interiors are very trendy and cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadeshagarwal75
50,A golden oldie,"This was one of our highlights in Hollywood. Not for the whizz bang lovers, but for those who are prepared to look closely, and stop and feel, this really is the closet you may get to such stars as Marilyn Monroe and Joan Crawford. This was the plane where the stars came to be 'made up' and it's worth your while to read all the information available. There is so much to see, including many recent films. I hope they don't update this Museum and ruin its charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bemibus
50,What a lovely place,"What a lovely place, lots of Hollywood memorabilia - Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecture prison cell set was amazing and my personal preference - $15 entrance is well worth it !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrahamS756
30,Haunted!,A fun stop for tourists but you won't catch any locals in there. The museum is said to be haunted! woooooooooooo......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
40,Great Hollywood Memorabilia,"We tripped over the museum and thought why not have a look. We were thrilled with the amount of memorabilia inside this very beautiful building. The mueseum covers 4 floors including the dungeon and is packed to the edges with photos, costumes, posters, information and more. The majority of it is 'old' Hollywood but there was definitely more recent additions to satisfy a wide range of ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulietL164
40,Good but not Great,"We went here during the rain. There was plenty to see on all four levels. Some were better than others but that is mostly personal opinion as to what interests you. The price seemed a little expensive but at the end, going through all levels, it seemed much better and appropriate for what was all there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14emilyr
30,Not the most exciting but still good,Did this as part of Go Los Angeles Card and was good. Not overly exciting compared to other things you can do but interesting that it was the old Max Factor building with a bit of history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23tiffanyk
40,Great museum,Chock a block full of movie and tv memorabilia. A must for any fan in Hollywood. Had an awesome time and the basement is definitely the best part with all the horror items. Loved it. Only negative is the place a bit of a reno but I guess it adds to it's old world charm. All good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenkiSensei1
30,Interesting but in serious need of an update,"As we love the movies we decided to go there. They have a lot of interesting and great memorabilia, but it seems like they have not updated the museum in the last 20 years or so... any new memorabilia has just been squeezed in between the old stuff, making it very disorganised.Best part was for sure the basement with the 'Silence of the Lamb' cell",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thedane80
50,Fun way to spend a few hours,"I would thoroughly recommend this quirky museum. An interesting way to spend a few hours and in comparison to the other museums nearby, it is great value for money. We have teenage kids and it kept everyone interested. Lovely to see all the old Hollywood style. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natclay
50,hollywood at its best - hollywood museum,"this is a fascinating museum best bits for myself were of the Marilyn Monroe exhibits which was outstanding, any Marilyn fan would love this, apart from personal items, costumes from her films Max factor exhibit, and for all those horror fans also an exhibit.this is what old Hollywood was glamour and the golden days of movies. entry fee is very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jutty42
50,Best local Hollywood attraction,This is an unbelievable museum . It was only $12 each and we were in there for over 2 hours . Right next door to Mels Diner as well .It has all sorts of Hollywood memerobilia and horror including the set of the prison cells from Silence of the Lambs.Really good value and actually very intersting .If you love Hollywood stars from a Golden Era and you love horror then you will love this,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandsmouse
40,Interesting,It's not the biggest museum but it holds enough to keep you interested for an hour. The main points of interest for me were the Max Factor and Marilyn exhibits and my two teenage sons enjoyed the horror exhibition. It is largely a collection of memorabilia (photos etc) but there are also a few exhibits with some interesting context. There are one or two exhibits (the shoes worn by the Harry Potter trio at their Walk of Fame Stars!) which I felt really shouldn't be there but overall it was a good way to spend an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabmum66
30,interesting for movie and tv tragics,"There is little appealing in the area other than an interest in movies and tv - this will be of interest for those who believe in the history of the ""golden days""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
30,"Interesting collectibles, but feels tired","I went to the Hollywood Museum as I had purchased a Go Pass for LA, and it was one of the included attractions. It sounded interesting, however upon arriving the whole place felt very tired and dated. Even the most recent items (of which there were a lot!) just didn't really have the set up they deserve. The worst part for me was the fact that each room has multiple televisions playing multiple different videos, which creates an awful noise and makes it hard to stay for long. Invest in some interactive screens and headphones and let the visitors pick what they want to see more of instead of forcing everything down their throats at once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiecarroll13
50,Four Floors of Movie and TV History,"On November 27th I visited this museum around noon. The website said they were open until 5pm, but they closed early (just as I was leaving- whew!) at 2:30pm for a parade, so you might want to check with the museum ahead of time. The price was $15 for adults, but if you're a student you get a $3 discount.Anyways, there was a TON of stuff to see here. They allow photographs. I spent 2 hours and that was almost rushing it. The first floor focuses mainly on makeup celebrities used in the 40s and 50s (mostly), and Hollywood in it's early days (lots of photos!!). The basement was the 'horror' section, and had many clothes and photos from movies like 'Phantom of the Opera', the 'Elvira' TV show, and vampire movies. There was also a 'Silence of the Lambs' jail hallway, which was awesome. The second floor focused on child actors and Marilyn Monroe (which includes huge nude photos of her--nothing too scandalous-- but just be aware if you're coming with kids). The last and third floor focused more on clothing from TV shows and some movies (PeeWee's Bicycle!). There were bathrooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor, not sure about the other 2 floors.Other than a vending machine, there is no food for purchase but this museum is basically on Hollywood Blvd, and right next door to a diner so there are many food options.I don't if anyone actually reads the reviews I write, so if this was helpful at all please give me a thumbs up. Thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/861christinah
50,Hollywood Museum,The newest exhibit - Silence of the Lambs was great. We really liked this film. The rest of the museum was well worth seeing as well. Loads of hollywood history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanfE2470LP
40,Hollywood museum,"Close to all the attractions around the Chinese theatre and the walk of fame. The first floor is dedicated to makeup as the building used to be Max Factor. You'll get to see the beauty supplies of some famous actresses. There's a floor of costumes and Marilyn Monroe paraphernalia and a floor of horror film. It all seems really cool but I wonder how much of it is actually stuff used in the movies. It seemed a lot of the costumes or props were similar but not exact to what is depicted in the photo next to it. We wondered what was real and what was just for effect. For instance, they had all the wizards wanna from Harry Potter there and I doubt they are the ones the actors actually used. We figured they were bought in gift shops. A lot of it is no doubt legit. I think some more recent stuff that appears inauthentic is there for effect to represent movies they may not have stuff for. It's a really old building so it is stuffy and warm at times. It was interesting and I think it's inexpensive. It was included in our Go Los Angeles cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DyinToTravelBy
50,Exquisite!,"I'm a big fan of the Golden age of Hollywood as well as Silence of the Lambs, and this museum delivered on both fronts. With heaps of authentic outfits and props dating back decades from all kinds of movies, and a creepy and impressively detailed dungeon of Dr Lester's cell, this place has everything. Plus a wall of headshots from heaps of golden age celebrities. Worth paying the entrance fees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naomie898
40,good museum,lovely lady greeted us at front desk and made us welcome. husband and i enjoyed a good look around this querky building. very interesting things to see and well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buglesChchNewZealand
50,movie and tv hisory,We had an excellent time there. There was a lot of reading to do on the first floor but all very interesting about make-up hair color and movie stars. The second and third floors had lots of clothing and props. Very chilling area about Silence of the Lambs and other monster and sci fi stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carribbeanmic
40,A new side of Hollywood,Went on a whim and so glad we did! First floor has so much insight and information on Max Factor's influence on Hollywood stars through his makeup and products. Lots of interesting information and wonderful pictures. Not as many costumes as I was hoping for and the first floor could have used some upkeep but that allowed the original vibe to remain. Definitely worth seeing :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009
40,insight into aspects of film making history including make-up,"There is a lot of memorabelia here to look at. if a movie biff, it is certainly interesting. Guide, a make-up artist, was very knowledgeable. Don't miss the basement where horror exhibits reign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
50,Excellent museum,"The museum is chock full of movie and TV memorabilia from the early days of Hollywood right up to current time - see Shirley Temple's outfits and a little later see clothes from Mad Men for example.There was a Marilyn Monroe retrospective when we were there and along with her infamous calendar shots, there were some of her costumes and sadly her autopsy reports.Well worth a stop. Accessible by using the ancient and original elevator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OntarioTrekker
50,Excellent day trip,My daughters and I visited The Hollywood Museum recently and it was like taking a wonderful stroll through iconic history! There are gorgeous outfits from movies on display along with personal belongings of the rich and famous. The Max Factor building has certainly been put to great use in creating this fabulous museum! Most enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jo-MollyBennett
40,I went for Lucille Ball,"My favorite was Lucille Ball's room -- but this is more for those really interested in Hollywood movies, especially during it's early days. There was a lot of really neat things to see and learn about, even my 9 year old was really into it, except for the basement, she refused to go down there. I even was a little creeped out, but it's do-able.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cudd8622
40,SO much fun!,"Visited with my son, husband and my son's friend... I LOVED it... the basement floor is all super creepy stuff and has Hannibal Lector's jail cell in it! If you love movies and television it's worth it!Has a lot of historical stuff from back in early Hollywood days, as well as more recent stuff!It's not super pricey, $15 per adult and $12 for students!Loved it; would recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/924trinityb
40,Extensive Memorabilia,"We visited on a Friday afternoon. Previous reviews noted the extensive collection of memorabilia on 4 floors and this is true. The building itself is quite interesting and the history of Max Factor in Hollywood and the United States is worth remembering as well. Parking next door at the lot next to Max's Diner for $15 was also available. We enjoyed the museum but its displays can be overwhelming given the amount of memorabilia and somewhat chaotic nature of the displays. Still, given the fair price of admission, worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rexflash
50,so much history in one place,"Absolutely love this place! So much history in one building, and its filled to the brim with old pictures and autographs as well as more modern films and TV props etc. Would recommend going into the basement ans seeing the actual prison hallway and cells from Silence Of The Lambs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceychu911
50,Fantastic memorabilia!,Take your time to visit each floor and don't forget the basement where the horror film memorabilia is located!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amysva
50,Happiest Place on Earth,"I have been in love with Old Hollywood and with Make up, what a better place to be. Saw my first Dumont TV and a Mutascope, never in,my live did i think i would put my face to a Mutascope. The displays and the autographs amazing, to have autographs from the stars of Intolerance (1916). if this review makes sense this is the place to go. I loved the LGBT display and so much to do and see. I will be back next year, cant wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertaw109
10,BORING,The smell hits you right in the face as soon as you enter. Old make up in every glass case you look at. Was interested to see Marlyn Monroe's collection but it did go on and on and on. Lady at the entrance where you pay looks like she should be behind one of those glass cases. If going to check it out i suggest a nose peg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleykearney
50,Huge amount on display,"Very friendly welcome to the museum. The cashier gave us some tips on the best way to see the museum which was nice.The amount on show is simply staggering. A lot of it was not really our thing but you have to admire the amount and quality of the exhibits.If you are a fan of the older style hollywood, especially Marilyn Monroe then the is the place for you.A lot of the exhibits are real sets from films and in the basement there is the cell set from 'Silence of the lambs'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alex965
50,Fantastic display of Hollywood movies and their stars,"Completely not accessible for wheelchair users or persons with any disabilities. But, if you are able bodied, perhaps the owner will one day make it compliant for all. it is one of the best museums I have ever experienced. Full of movie history and artifacts that bring back memories of childhood and just great times. This is one museum you might not want to miss. It is priced very well for the displays and size of this museum. It is in the old Max Factor factory building and still has many of the items associated with the factory. Plus, so many movie making sets and items actually used in many favorite movies. Very nice museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess5
50,Lots to see,Excellent museum. Lots of information about Hollywood actors. Lots of costumes from years ago...very comprehensive overview of life as an actor/actress in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kir2
50,Excellent!,"We visited here based upon the strength of reviews here and in my guidebook. We had thought about a studio tour, but these seem based around a large number of US TV shows we don't know.This was a great way to spend a couple of hours. The building itself has some character, and it's full of famous costumes and props from movies and TV shows. I also found the make up display sections much more interesting than I had anticipated. Watch the documentary on Max Factor - sitting on the pews from 'The Exorcist'! Also visit the 'Silence of the Lambs set' - quite atmospheric!Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henmanfan
50,Hidden Gem!,"We bought an LA Go Card and did all the main attractions. Happened to see this museum on a side street and decided last minute to visit because it was included on the card. Wow, what a cool place to visit. So glad we decided to include it in our visit. The memorabilia from movies was so extensive and the building that houses these treasures has a history itself. I would definitely recommend that you include this in your next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinetracy
50,Old and Glamourous Hollywood,"Went to the Hollywood Museum end of August 2016. We booked tickets online but we could easily have bought tickets on the day as it wasn't very busy which was a surprise as it's very close to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If you like old Hollywood you'll love this, there are some beautiful photos of Marilyn Monroe in the exhibition dedicated to her. There was also a child stars exhibition and lots more.It is spread out over 3 or 4 floors of the old Max Factor building and very easy to get around. We were there for around an hour and half.It's a little gem amongst all the chaos of the Chinese Theatre/Walk of Fame. Really worth a visit and only $15 per person. Should also point out it is open Wednesday through to Sunday. We also popped into Mel's diner afterwards which is right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lulu1722014
40,Worth a visit,"This museum is an exhibit of all things Hollywood and is definitely worth a visit, at $15 entry, there are worse ways to spend your money in LA!!The Max Factor exhibit is fantastic but our favourite part was the dungeon with the Hannibal Lector exhibit. There are also many more wonderful things to see from film and TVs shows both past and present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/domhelen
50,Was skeptical but so glad we went!,"I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about this place. Did not disappoint. My kids thought is was so cool. Definitely go see the video about Max Factor. Worth seeing all the memorabilia!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sofigigi
30,Interesting,"If you are into oldHollywood and make-up, sign up. This is an affordable museum with many costumes and make-up history. My mom who is sixty two would have loved this so much, my kid? Thought it was okay. I liked it. A big Marliyn Monroe exhibit right now which is really interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissawJ5135YW
50,Vacation,"Great museum! If you are a film/tv buff, it's a must see. Props, costumes, and of course there is Marilyn. This museum is in the old Max Factor building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniah534
40,Worth a visit,"The Max Factor exhibit on the ground floor gives a reel feel of Hollywood yesteryear. It is a bit of an eye -opener to his innovative and career defining work with make-up.The Marilyn Monroe exhibition, including a copy of her death certificate and PM report was fascinating.My only gripe is that each exhibit has some TV or audio running alongside, and tends to create a bit of aural overload.Good value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334
50,What a Treat,We have passed by this place for years and finally took the time to go inside. This is the orginal Max Factor make up headquarters from Hollywood's golden age. See where the stars would go for make up. Tour the 4 floors of Hollywood memorabilia. This is a great value. Allow a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiptonH
50,Always a Gem!,"Best museum in Hollywood. Big collection of old and new. Visit once a year and notice that they change out the costumes on the upper level. Teens loved it because they also show props and costumes from current movies and television shows, mixed in with the classics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herculesmom
50,What an understated gem,We had an amazing couple of hours at this wonderful secret. Tucked away in the old Max Factor building it gives an amazing insight into the glamour of the golden age of Hollywood ... And then catapults you up to the modern day. A must see attraction that blew me away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsitaly2018
40,I couldn't believe the Autographs!!,Not sure small children would enjoy it. It is located in the Old Max Factor building where Max Factor made the women beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Npmrmom
50,So fun!,This was very cool! It is 4 levels and you walk at your own pace. Their are so many neat things from movies and shows that they have on display. My favorite part was seeing where Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball got their hair and make up done. So many fascinating things you wouldn't expect to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sleonetti18
40,Worth a visit!,"Great seeing Monroes clothes and outfits, Hannibal Lector's cell and lots of other things! Well worth a visit, but not as a big deal! We went while passing by, so if you want to plan a great outing do that first and do this if you have time over. So not a must but worth going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifebywania
50,Fun. Fun. Fun.,Fascinating pieces of show biz history. And even some current history. Well worth it. Every costume and prop was fun to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420Frank
40,Wonderful for Glamour lovers,"This is a great museum. The Max Factor archive is excellent as is the photographic collection. My favourites were the stars at home; beautifully unnatural! The other exhibits are a bit random, but there is certainly something for everyone. Also, if you have hop on/off tickets, you can get 2-1 admission which is super value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jubilee-jo
40,So much to look at!,"The Hollywood museum is located in the original Max Factor building and is stuffed with Hollywood memorabilia! The museum is filled with pictures, costumes and even cars of famous films.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727JamieW
50,A trip down memory lane!!,"The Hollywood Museum is a great place to visit. The museum showcases costumes previously worn by celebrities. This building was purchased by Max Factor in 1928 and officially opened in 1935 after the Great Depression and regularly visited by Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball and many other famous celebrities of the time. For only around $15 a visit, it's a must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samantha_Lea_Sherry
50,For Golden Hollywood era lovers like me..this,"place is definitely worth a visit! NOt that pricey either ..can not tell you about parking as came on Bus 2 and walked here from Sunset Blvd. This place is divided into 4 floors including the basement which deals with my favorite movies...my favorite genre ...Horror...I was told this is the Old Max Factor Building and has been here over 100 yrs..they still do have an elevator but I think it is more for carrying props, mannequins, and other heavy equipment..Did not see a wheel chair. On the first floor, dedicated to Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe..and you can see what they had on their dressers. I saw a lot of pictures of the Golden Age like Mickey Rooney, Frank Sinatra, John Barrymore..so many that come to my mind from the actors my Mother told me about! Many old movie posters from different movies..like westerns, adventure and more..Alot of costumes..and equipment..All of these Golden Age actors were tiny like my petite mother..!\..The original Super Man costume is on display in a glass case in the front!..I saw Superman every weekday in the afternoon after school when growing up..I learned English this way! The car that Cary Grant owned is on display..It was used in a movie with Grace Kelly...From there proceeded to the basement, where I spent most of my time..it was dark to put you in the mood. Greeted by none other than the talking skeleton from Tales from the Grave"" at the door. IT was also dark and those that are easily spooked might get a little nervous or even leave, but hang in there..I took my floor tour clockwise, saw the cell where Hannibal Lector spent his days on Silence of the Lambs..and there was even a padded room but I dared not close the door. From the dark hallway, I saw Jason and Freddy Krueger, not in flesh, but even the mannequins looked lifelike/ Also props and the chainsaw from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre..Elvira was also there..as well as the Mummy..so many horror mannequins in costume, some posters, and more..Hard to take pictures because the museum did not want me to use the flash..After I felt comfortable that I had seen enough...I went to the second floor.The second floor had a regular prop of the Beverly Hillbillies. This floor was mainly dedicated to Awards and ceremonies. There were pictures, costumes, videos, and more. A corner of this floor had Peanuts paraphernalia including the dog..Also many expensive dresses and tuxedos along with pictures of the actors that received their awards. The dresses that the actresses wore on Dynasty are on display!..I saw a prop of the Eiffel Tower in the elevator..there was a worker monitoring it..THe 3rd floor exhibition dealt with the acccomplishments of gay/bisexual actors/actresses. I already knew that this kind of lifestyle was NOT acceptable in my childhood yrs of the 60s, 70s and prior to this time..If an actor or anyone working in the film industry let the public know they were gay, they were blackballed by the industry. My mother told me that she knew Rock Hudson was gay in the 60s!..so most of these actors lived a hushed up life...only their close friends or companions knew their orientation..Some of these Golden Age actors were Charles Laughton and his wife, Sal Mineo, Betty Davis, Liberace, and more..I saw a lot of their movies and I can attest to the fact that they were really actors..not like today where all you have to be is a pretty face..there is so much trash on the screen and on television nowadays that I do not even go to the movies anymore..In general, this is a really good museum and worth visiting..but I notice that not all actors or actresses were given their due here. Notably missing was my favorite cowboy, John Wayne..I know that they can not fit everyone in here, but he should hae at least been in a video..maybe he was and I did not notice him..but he was in a Golden Age poster by the door...I could have stayed longer but they were closing..I will post pictures in a later date..!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae
50,Loved it.....,"The feel, the nostalgia, the stories, the connections to stars of a bygone era..... Definitely worth a visit, and a fair price on entry too..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569adellel
50,Golden Era and Modern Era Hollywood,"The old Max Factor building is a wonderful place for this museum. The first floor features his makeup suites for stars by hair color, because he was the first to realize that some colors are more flattering to each skin/hair type. There' a Marilyn Monroe room and a Lucille Ball room. There are lots of memorabilia from silent periods, golden age and current age TV and movies. Lots of movie posters with autographs. Lots of costumes and props. There are 3 floors, and the 3rd floor is dedicated to highlight the contributions of LGBT actors, directors, writers, editors, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriP920
40,great time,"Park over at Highland and walk. Parking runs $15 for the day but safe and quick walk. Museum was 3 floors of pictures, artifacts and videos. Videos are from 80-90's but good. These are long documentary type and only a wood chair or 2 to sit. Spent 4 hrs. exploring. Would not be fun for kids. Overall worth a one time gander.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneylove69
50,Cool Hollywood history,"Set just off Hollywood Boulevard, this museum is packed full of movie props and memorabilia from past and present. The ground floor is full of early Hollywood makeup history -- the building used to be Max Factor back in the day. Other floors have horror movie themes and TV displays from recent and current shows like Mad Men and Orange Is The New Black. The highlight for us, however, was getting to walk down the asylum corridor and see Hannibal Lector's prison cell and getting to sit in Clarice Starling's folding chair! Great fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenKilda
50,Good history and artifacts.,This is on the Go LA card. Cool history of a keep and some neat memoribilia. The dungeon is really cool and creepy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhV3290PS
40,Hollywood History,"Really enjoyed seeing this piece of Hollywood history right in the heart of Hollywood Bvld. The main floor of the museum is more of historic landmark, focusing on what that building was used for and featuring items and information from that period. My personal favorite part of the museum was the basement, which had a chamber of horrors feel to it, with horror memorabilia and sets. The upper floors featured costumes from current TV and movies, which was really cool to see. To me, this was a must see when in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derrick_Ross
40,Beautiful old Max Factor building museum.,"Cool artifacts (costumes and other memorabilia) from older and newer TV shows/movies (I Love Lucy, Star Wars, Star Trek, Harry Potter, The Good Wife, The Peanuts, Silence of the Lams, Elvira, etc) cool museum, glad we went through it. 4 Floors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joangQ4260WQ
50,Loved this 100 percent better than trying to tour hollywood homes,pleasant surprise. Exhibits from many years ago up to current. They have old movies or clips playing in some of the exhibits. They are actual costumes. Very informative and up to date. I could have spent all day. One of the best surprises was the ladies restroom which is vintage maybe 1950 and was used by Max Factor employees. Loved loved loved this place. Well done. Everyone else outside crowded and sweaty and i was in this gem of a museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlchildres
30,Hollywood Museum Review,"My wife especially loves old movies so this was on our list to go. The cost is 15.00. They are only open Wed – Sat (check and make sure) and close at 5:00. We got there an hour before they closed and they had to ask us to leave. I would not allow anything less than 3 hours. We did not go into the basement since we don’t like scary things.For the negative, the 3rd floor pushed the gay agenda. Had a video of a preacher of the LGBT church there pushing that agenda. I personally disagree with that and was offended. They made it a point to have a wall of people that were gay. If they wanted to make a museum about homosexual people that is fine, but it was not balanced at all. I would not recommend this for small children. There were things on the 3rd floor that were good, but I would recommend not going up there.The history of makeup was well represented as well and how it had a special role in film. It could have been more organized. It seems like there was a poster of casa Blanca behind a star wars. Old pictures were everywhere on the first floor.We had a wonderful time there and would go again when we are in the area. Well worth the $15.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgma77
30,Lots of Memorabilia,"We visited during our stay in Hollywood. There was lots to see, but I started to wonder if all the stuff on display was authentic or if they were just replicas. There were lots of props and photos. But it came across as collections that anyone could buy or make, and then set up on display in a historical building. I did, however, like the basement with the horror props. My kids were scared. I loved the way it looked just like the set of Silence of the Lambs! Overall, I'd probably skip this one if I had to do it again, especially with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jans778
30,One of the cheaper musuem options,Admission is $15 for adults. It has 4 levels. I popped in out of curiosity. Some neat things to see but kind of boring. Mainly photos and outfits of different stars from tv and movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taurusthebull40
30,Hollywood Memorabilia Madness,The Hollywood Museum is a neat place if you love Hollywood history. It looks like they do a good job of rotating items trying to stay relevant in switching up the displays to stay current with recently released TV shows and movies.I enjoyed seeing outfits worn by Stallone in Rocky and Michael Jackson during his Bad tour. The basement has some cool stuff from Silence of the Lambs and it was creepy enough to scare my kids.All and all I'm glad I went and people will enjoy it as long as it isn't the only reason you went to Hollywood and Highland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioS940
50,A Hidden treasure,"The place is not very well advertise, but if you like the real, old, charming Hollywood and its history you must visit this museum. The most wondeful collection of old movie equipments, cameras, make up staff, and all bits and pieces from way back from the begining. Absolutly amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384renatan
50,If you like movie memorabilia and history surrounding the film industry this place is a must.,"The old Max Factor Building in downtown Hollywood is a nice visit all by itself. Now fill it with everything from Ruby Slippers to the Hillbilly's truck mov'n to Beverly. Plan on at least 3 hours and if your wife is like mine, 5 hours to be safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/524KenS
30,For Hollywood classic movie lovers,"This museum collects mainly Hollywood classic items. such as the Max Factor make ups, their posters, Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe's evening dresses. If you are not a Hollywood classic lover, don't waste your time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sychan987
30,A quick visit to Hollywood Museum,Visited this museum which specializes in costumes and make-up for movies. An average museum with less number of exhibits attracts less visitors and would take les than a hour for taking a quick round. We visited the museum as the visit was included in our Los Angeles GO card and would not have purchased the $15 per person ticket separately to visit this attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArindamG517
40,Full of stuff,"Very worth a visit over all its floors.Lots of movie and TV memorabilia from all eras, costumes, props etc. Could have spent longer in there than we did, as there is a lot to see and non-flash photos are allowed. Allow at least couple of hours to see it all without hurrying.It's also very cheap to get in, and right next door there's a great place to eat and drink afterwards.If you can't manage the stairs, they have a large open-plan freight elevator at the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margondine
40,Nostalgia Fest,This has an amazing collection of film and TV memorabilia all the way back to the golden age of Hollywood. A teeny weeny negative is that the building is architecturally beautiful it would be lovely if the outside was made to look as it did way back when.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redcetera
50,"Hollywood, Past and Present","This is an economical and educating look at the past and present stars of Hollywood and what made them look as perfect as they did. The museum is in the original Max Factor building and here you'll see how and why Marilyn Monroe became a blonde. Max Factor had specially colored rooms for every hair color so that he could see what a star's colors would look like in technicolor. The musuem owns the largest collection of publicity stills I've ever found as well as props, costumes and entire sets from blockbuster movies of the past and the present. The walk down the dark hall to Hannibal Lecter's cell in Silence of the Lambs is worth the price of admilssion by itself. If you're going to Hollywood, you have to see this. Cameras are allowed without flash, so you'll walk away with quite a collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/area51619
50,right off Hollywood Blvd and a bit south of Ripleys,"This was originally the Max Factor makeup factory and much of the first floor was dedicated to Max's advancements in makeup and its application but even though I am a guy I found it quite interesting. Whole rooms dedicated to blondes, redheads, brunettes etc. The majority of the museum is from the movies and TV, with good wax figures and a lot of entertainment history and factoids mixed in. Well worth the relatively modest expense if you are a movie buff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artj377
30,An ok attractiion,This is the old Max Factor building and at first glance it appears as though it's all about make up and hairdos. It actually had a lot of artifices from a long time ago to recent times. The building appears a little dated and smells a bit musty but it was good to see some things such as costumes from famous films and tv shows. Ok for a cloudy/rainy day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elinorheasman
30,A Step Back in Time,"This is in the old Max Factor Building on Highland. It has 4 floors of memorabilia from days gone by. The most interesting for me was a room devoted to Marilyn Monroe...dresses, makeup and pictures.. The basement (dark and spooky) has figures and rooms devoted to horror films including a jail cell of Hannibal Lecter. It would take about 30 minutes to walk thru depending how long you spend in each room or want to read the history of each exhibit. Adult ticket is $15. Worth seeing but not for your first choice if u have limited time or resources.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronnie333_3
50,Awesome! A must see!,"While in Los Angeles to visit a college, we took our daughter to see The Hollywood Museum. Her major will be Film and Television, so we were trying to find things to do that were focused on that. What a great place this turned out to be. So much history in one building, not to mention tge history of the building alone! The star power that walked those halls is incredible! You will not be disappointed if you visit. Reasonable admission cost for the amount of exhibits you get to view. I would highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsblp
40,Cool exhibits,This has some interesting exhibits/artifacts. You can tell the building is pretty old because it just smells old and musty inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kydizzle
50,Allow Plenty of Time!,"Hollywood is, for the most part, a bit tacky, so we didn't have particularly high expectations of this place. How wrong we were!Set in a fabulous Art Deco building (the old Max Factor factory), the museum is bulging with exhibits, artefacts and information. That they've managed to gather so much authentic memorabilia is really impressive. And, as well as the exhibits, there are the rooms that the stars of yesteryear used to be made up by the legendary Max Factor himself.Do visit and allow yourself a little more time than you think you'll need, or you'll find yourself having to rush to finish your tour before the museum closes for the night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobYork
50,One of the best places to visit in Hollywood!,"Now that the central area of Hollywood has been cleaned up, there are now ""museums"" and ""attractions"" that want to help part visitors with their money. Many of these places are really no different from what one can find in many resort towns. So save your money. Nevertheless, the Hollywood Museum does not fit into this category. Here you can learn about the history of Hollywood from the early days as a small town surrounded by orange groves to the current times as the capital of entertainment. In the Art-Deco, former Max Factor building, you will be overwhelmed by the different exhibit areas covering many subjects having to do with show business from cosmetics, to costumes, TV and film making equipment, etc. I easily spent over three hours here. Plus, the lovely interior of the ground floor add to the glamor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dottyk362
50,"A4 floors of really interesting film, TV and behind the scenes items",Wish I'd devoted more time to this really interesting museum - particularly liked the basement with psycho memorabilia and other horror films. Go to the toilet as they are amazing- very retro!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8629SVjuliep
50,Quirky but fun,"This museum doesn't have the feel of a polished tourist attraction like many of its newer rivals in and around Hollywood. But the fact that some of the exhibits seem a little dated just adds to the charm of the place - it's almost like going around someone's personal collection of Hollywood memorabilia!Mixed in with interesting items from ""old"" Hollywood are a number of exhibits from more recent days including costumes and props from films made in the last couple of years. There should be something for everyone here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P9938HFjohnp
40,What a Dive into Hollywood History,"This museum is funky and definitely worth a visit if you want to see some of Hollywood's famous (and infamous) roots. The building is old, which seems to carry off the historical focus of the exhibits. A hoot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJRB1
40,Kitschy fun,"This isn't a highly polished Kama commercialized Museum, which is kind of what I expected... This is better, slightly kitschy and unpolished coma and quite fun... I went on a Saturday and it was surprisingly quiet, given its location and the name of the attraction, which you would think might draw hordes of tourists.. it is 4 levels memorabilia from film's, and a few television shows.. by far the Highlight for me was the recreation of Silence of the Lambs in the basement, the long creepy Corridor of the asylum that Jodie Foster goes to walk down before she meets Anthony Hopkins for the first time... In fact the whole basement was quite fun especially as I am a horror movie fanatic! Overall I would recommend this place just expect kitschy relaxed atmosphere and you will enjoy it :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748richiet
40,Marilyn fans and movie fans must see.,used our LA GO card and were very amazed at all the things to see and learn about in this Museum. It will take a good 2 hours plus to really see it all . It is a lot of walking as is most things to do while in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tctommy
30,Not the best thing to see in Hollywood,"We had the LA Go Card so this was included. If you have the Go Card or some sort of coupon it's worth stopping in. I'm not sure we would have paid the admission price for it. They have 4 floors that have memorabilia from different movies but nothing that really blows you away. Save the money and go do a studio tour, they're all better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
40,Retro fun,"This place is a fabulous throwback look at Hollywood. There is not a lot for younger kids, but teens and older will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TotallyMadeUpHandle
20,Good thing we had already paid,"We went in here since we had the 'Go Card'. We had already paid for admission. There were a few cool things. But mostly it was dusty crap from movies I had never heard of. I, as a man, actually found the fact that this building was the old Max Factor Cosmetics building the most interesting (if that tells you anything)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyle7692
40,Cool nugget of Hollywood history,"I live about four blocks away from all the action in Hollywood so needless to say I host A LOT of friends and family. I dont mind though because it allows me to explore my town.The reason this is such a gem is because you can grab some breakfast and get some history all in a couple of hours. Mels Diner is right next door. For one Mels is a people pleaser. Doesnt matter what age my guest has been they love Mels. Something about the 50's ambiance. When youre done indulging in some bacon and eggs go on over to the museum. I believe you even get a discount for dining there.This museum is cool because it is housed in the old Max Factor building. The premier makeup artist of the movie industry. On the main floor you'll learn about how makeup transformed film and vice versa. Theres makeup boudoirs from old starlets like Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.On the second floor they have old movie props and memorabilia with a rotating exhibit. Its cool to go during Oscar season because they usually have all the costumes from the various nominated movies. When David Carradine passed away they had all his gear from Kill Bill and the Kung Fu series.In the basement is all their scary movie props. Pretty creepy but still PG for the little ones.Id definitely recommend this place for families and people that just love old Hollywood memorabilia. Hooray for Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaezaJay
50,"Lucille Ball, Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe and Hollywood Glamour!","This is the former ""Max Factor"" building where famous stars like Lucille Ball, Jean Harlow, and Marilyn Monroe were clients.The art deco design is a real classic. It has the feel of old Hollywood. There's a lot to see and observe at The Hollywood Museum.Definitely worth a visit when you're in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdriannaA_12
50,Hollywood Museum is a must see.,Take advantage of seeing the wonderful exhibits in the Hollywood Museum. You can spend 30 minutes or 4 hours in this exhibit. You won't want to miss this exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486patrician
50,Don't miss!!,Skip the wax museums and spend some time at the Hollywood Museum. It was one of our highlights during our 4 day trip. My 12 year old loved it too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m_adams2016
10,AWFUL - poorly done. Very Limited authentic Items,"These folks earn a ""Pants on Fire"" for the accuracy of their promotion all materials - their Web site, their promotional materials materials bear little relationship to what you will actually see.This is not a ""museum"" so much as a contrived collection of modern movie posters, vast amounts of framed 8 by 10 photos of the stars, and endless framed magazine email ads for Max Factor products from the 1940s.There is very little actual movie or TV props or costumes. There are less than a half dozen examples of ""A quality"" material in the entire museum. What they have is NOT from movies anyone has ever heard of. Or they are costumes worn by minor characters.This has to be one of the most POORLY described collections in any ""museum"" anywhere in the entire United States. The Star Trek display, for example, has three costumes. There are no explanations as to who actually wore any of the costumes. There is no information as to WHICH Star Trek movie/TV series the costumes actually appeared in. Yes, there is a generic photo of the major stars - but NONE of them are wearing the actual costumes on display.The entire first floor will be mind numbingly boring to most males, most children, and a good percentage of females. There are several rooms full of battered and well used make up cases. There are several displays of half used tubes of old Max Factor cosmetic products.The basement ""horror area"" is a bunch of posters and badly done rubber masks which would not frighten anyone.The ""stars cars"" included a prop car used by Elvira in one of her cheesy horror movies and a badly done reproduction of the Clampetts vehicle from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". There were NO cars actually on display which had any connection to a ""Star"".This museum is NOT suitable for children - nothing is particularly offensive - but very very little will be of any interest to children. The museum is not suitable for people who have any sort of mobility issues or for folks in wheelchairs.Most of all, this collection will offend movie and TV buffs - it is so NOT what you will be expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellybC4329TP
50,Great attraction near Hollywood walk of fame,"Great feel of Hollywood history. At the same time not very time consuming, all can be covered in about 2 hours. I didn't want to be stuck in a huge museum for hours. We had fun and learnt new things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zumichka

50,Worth a Visit,I live in LA. Friends were visiting and we decided to stop at this museum because we were going to look at the stars on Hollywood Blvd. We ended up spending over 2 hours here. It was fascinating. Had costumes from this years Oscar nominees. SO interesting to see how small the stars really are from the size of their clothes. Lots of memorabilia and cool films and videos about the history of Hollywood. Good value for the money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmartin969
50,I loved this museum,"I am a real movie buff, and so I absolutely fell in love with this museum.There are plenty of standard displays you expect of a museum, but also a lot of interactive ones, where you really get to experience all of the wonderful memorabilia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyKelly

40,Historic Max Factor building with lots to see,"This building offered a lot of interesting history on the movie industry. Max Factor was the ""make up king"" and instrumental in providing the right hair color and skin tones for many actors including Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402dougd
40,Perfect for the fan of Old Hollywood,"This museum, inside the old Max Factor (a makeup guru for the stars) building, is very unassuming from the outside , but on the inside is amazing and chock full of artifacts from old Hollywood. Each floor is dedicated to a different theme, the first floor is an overview of old Hollywood with a ton of pictures as well as the makeup/hair rooms of various stars as well other artifacts , one floor is dedicated to the history of TV as well as actually Hollywood (the place). One floor is dedicated to horror, and has the Hannibal Lector's actual jail cell. The only two theoretic downsides are, one, that there is very is very little on modern movies, so if that's what's you're looking for, all you'll find is one or two small displays. Also, the museum, especially the ground floor, is very disorganized and feels a bit less professional, and it's very easy to get lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
40,"$15 for adults, about 1-2 hour trip","Pretty cool, lots of old costumes but predominately make up and photos. A cool underground dungeon area and three stories of rooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaJ805
50,Surprisingly Good,"The museum is more extensive than I would have guessed, with costumes and photographs chronicling a great deal of Hollywood history. The building itself w",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XXXXXVXXXXX
40,Hollywood collectibles,"I enjoyed the museum, but I actually was expecting more. I did learn a lot about Max Factor's influence on Hollywood celebs. We used our Go card to get in and was glad it was included on the pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyr253
40,Movie History Galore,"As part of the Go Card (San Diego), we made a trip up to Hollywood for this museum. The museum is chock full of Hollywood Movie history. Many of the displays brought back memories of the past, so it was fun. I wasn't too fond of the Horror Movie section, but that's just me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fainr
50,Interesting Hollywood History,"This museum is full of artifacts from TV and movie history. It is a fun museum to visit. Most interesting are the film clips about Max Factor and his role in developing cosmetics for, first, black and white movies and then for color. Who knew? He played a major role in determining, for example, what color hair was best for various actresses and then developed the cosmetics to compliment them. It is conveniently located in the center of action in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruise72

30,Not worth it if…,"… you are going for the Harry Potter exhibit. There are two costumes, a broom, and some wands. Not very much stuff there.On the other hand, there are a lot of old Hollywood history items to see. Much of it is from the very early days so it may not appeal to younger people.There are three stories and it's a big place. It's well-kept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxS236
30,Neat little place,"It doesn't cost much to get in, but you can see some cool things. The bottom floor was my family's favorite, lots of horror memorabilia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korndogizard
10,Closed Monday and Tuesday,"I was so excited to see this museum but, the articles I read weren't clear on the days closed. It is not that great from the outside and looks run down. Cute Mel's dinner next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390
50,Interesting,A lot of really cool original artifacts. Some that are one of a kind treasures like The Wizard of Oz ruby slippers and a lot more.Well worth the money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MasterRater
50,Fantastic (somewhat hidden) gem,"Really didn't expect much with this place as it's quite cheap, but boy it was fantastic. Very relaxed atmosphere and not crowded. Definitely worth a visit. Another big plus was the staff just leave you be without hassling you like on other tours in Hollywood. They do request no flash photography but the pictures below worked out OK on a cheap digital camera without the flash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAK2123
40,i really enjoyed it,"we went on a spur to the moment--i really enjoyed the museum, lots to see and explore! you can take your time and stroll through each and every floor. as mentioned very interesting things to see there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sillygirl67
40,Love The Horror Exhibit,My favorite part of the whole museum was the Hannibal Lector section. It feels like you are walking down the hallway to his cell. If only they had a wax figure of him in there. They even had a padded room. It was awesome and they played music from different horror movies. We heard the theme song from Poltergeist. The other floors and items were pretty cool too. You will want at least two hours to see and read everything. They have a lot of stuff. Older people would really enjoy a lot of the stuff on the first floor but there is stuff for younger people as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rach340
50,Best Museum for Film Buffs,"This is the second time we've visited this museum and I was slightly worried it wouldn't live up to my memories, however this visit excelled them! Set over 4 floors in the original Max Factor (who knew he was a real person!) make up building, with an original pale pink Art Deco facade, this remains my favourite museum.The various original make-up rooms painted to compliment hair colour were really interesting on the ground floor, with a film on Max Factor and publicity shots of every Hollywood Star you can think of.Last time (in 2008).it was a little like rummage in a movie buffs attic, lots of memorabilia but not much organisation which did have a charm of its own, however now the displays are all organised and it works really well.It has rolling footage beside relevant costumes, including Marilyn Monroe's dress that she wore for entertaining the troops.It's not just about film, there are lots of TV shows represented including ""Orange is the New Black"", the glittering outfits from ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""The Beverley Hill Billies"" car.There are also loads of original movie posters lining the stairs and an an amazing autograph hunters display.Finally, they've really updated the horror basement, who doesn't want to walk down The Silence of the Lambs corridor? This would be an amazing venue for a Halloween party!The Christmas tree displays were fabulous created by the appropriately named Dr. Christmas.My only criticism, unlike pretty much anywhere else in America, is that there isn't a shop, I'd have loved a guide book, or a poster book, or a history of Max Factor book, they could even have a Max Factor concession in there, or is part of the delight that there is no hard sell, unlike the rest of the Hollywood strip?Last time you couldn't take photographs however this time you could but no flash photography and we took plenty.If you're interested in the history of Hollywood you must go here, it's like stepping back in time, if you only have time for one museum, make it this one, I can't recommend it highly enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375sharonr375
50,Nostalgia galore,"Not only is the extensive collection nicely presented, the contents is a big step back in living memory. The displays really appeal to the mind: the objects and stories are presented in a way that is very much in line of the visitors' own memories (at least in my case). The beautiful stories about, and display of goodies from Lucille Ball for instance, the replica of the car of the Beverly Hill Billies, the extensive presentation of Silence of the lams.... all of it is comprehensive and at the same time made with a Hollywood fun element in it. We loved every step through this great museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364Jaap_v
40,Lots of Hollywood history-including the beautiful building,Fascinating tour of the old Max Factor salon with some stunning exhibits including clothes and the personal effects that brings the glamour of Hollywood alive. Spend a couple of immersive hours here-$15 well spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stejaski
30,A lot of stuff,"Entering this museum we didn´t really know what to expect. What we found was a mix of a lot of stuff, mostly clothes. Old Hollywood and new stuff too. It was fun, but we spent elss than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniefornedal
40,Only for diehard movie fans,"Just off Hollywood Boulevard is this little museum, spread over 5 (narrow) floors of the Max Factor building. It has a decent collection of movie memorabilia arranged along a theme, and what they don't have originals of, they have decent replicas. There is really no theme to the whole thing; I suspect the owners threw in whatever they could get their hands on. If you are a true movie fan, this may be worth it; otherwise, you may feel it isn't worth your time/money. Try to negotiate a better price for entry as the guards at the entrance seem to have some discretion over entry prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
50,What a fun place!!,"The Hollywood Museum is very close to the Chinese Theater in the heart of Hollywood. This was the building where Hollywood actresses had their hair and makeup done by Max Factor. Rooms are divided by hair color.Highlights: The Redhead Room. My daughter and I both had goosebumps being in a room where Lucille Ball spent so much time over the years. They have memorabilia of hers. It is just a great room!Movie posters on the walls with autographs from the stars. Gene Kelly! Wow!The basement!! We were so creeped out, but we loved it. The best of the best was the set from Silence of the Lambs.One floor is dedicated to Marilyn Monroe. Lots of pictures, quotes, outfits, items of hers.Another floor had memorabilia from TV/movies from High School Musical to Harry Potter, the car from Beverly Hillbillies, mini set from It's a Mad, Mad, Mad. Mad World, Die Hard, Modern Family... Basically a huge variety.We spent a couple hours and felt we saw everything. If you are a huge Marilyn fan you would spend more time as there is a lot to see.We highly recommend this museum.Cost is $15, $12 for students and seniors. There are many stairs but I did see people getting into a lift-type elevator.The Hollywood Museum is very close to the Chinese Theater in the heart of Hollywood.

50,hollywood remembered,"this is one of those place that you just can't get enough of.it's located on highland blvd, right off of Hollywood blvd., in the old max factor building.sure, it's exciting to see all of the tourist trap stuff( especially when the individuals dressed up in costumes on Hollywood blvd. ask for $$$$, when you get a picture with them), but if you're into Hollywood memorabilia, this is a can't miss on your list of places to go!!!!! this will take you back to when Hollywood was more than just computer generated movies.it is three floors of nostalgia, that on more than one occasion will make you say wow. i've had the pleasure of visiting this museum a couple of times, and still don't believe that i saw everything. the tickets are very reasonably priced, but would you want to pay $$$$ for walking through a wax museum, or spending some leisurely time strolling back in the past, and remembering some of the good old times? highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909SteveC
40,Three floors of Hollywood memorabilia,The fact this museum is housed in the old max factor building adds interest and context for the items in blonde room and the brunette room. These rooms were where stars such as Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe had their hair done. It cost $15 each.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyc36
50,Great nostalgia,"We visited the museum after reading other favorable reviews and found that they were absolutely right!The museum is really the Max Factor museum, although it has lots more. The centerpiece of the museum is a set of color rooms where Max developed makeup for stars - e.g. the redhead room (Lucille Ball), the blonde room (Marilyn Monroe). There's a nice documentary film of Max's life and the company's growth. And then there's the rest - a great collection of film and tv memorabilia, with emphasis on makeup and costume. A real nostalgia trip for those who like old movies and shows, as I do. And if you do too, this is a must-see.One warning - parking in the public lot across the street is $20 for the day, no hourly rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695nathand
40,A lot of cool stuff,"Me and my wife enjoyed ourselves.Pro's1. Pretty affordable tickets2. Several floors of memorabilia3. Old Hollywood actresses and actors4. A decent sci-fi section5. Awesome horror section in the basement.Con's1. Parking sucks, dont park in lot next to diner, guy lies and says no where else to park. If u drive around block on the street behind the museum there is metered parking spots.2. Some of costumes and displays are not original. You can tell they have outfits they pieced together and make it appear that it is actual memorabilia.3. Everything is behind glass and it makes for bad pictures in low lighting and no flash allowed.4. They take up a lot of space on reality tv costumes and to me its not exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingW2341NS
40,A bit of old Hollywood,"It was a fun place to visit with so much memorabilia. From Dorothy's red slippers, to Pee Wee Herman's bike and the suit he wore, to the actual glass cell from Silence of the Lambs. It was a place you want to take your time to read about and look at everything. Fun to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommomb
30,"Old to modern, and in that order too","Its the old Max factor building and thats probably the best part.There are so many movie and TV costumes, but a costume is a costume... you're in Hollywood, you need to see the real actor, right?However for the money it passes an hour or so....If you're with under 25yr olds then there isn't a lot for them to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfage
50,The Hollywood Museum,"The Hollywood Museum was recommended to us by Brian from the Dearly Departed tour. We had the Go Los Angeles card, and the Hollywood Museum was included on that card. We went on Nov 1 around 3pm. There are technically 4 floors in this building, so the self guided tour could take some time to look at everything, so be aware. The basement was awesome & scary....beware of Jason upon entering the basement, he scared the crap out of us! The 1st floor with all the Max Factor makeup was really interesting, I enjoyed seeing all the rooms where Lucille Ball & Marilyn Monroe got their ""looks"" from. There is a lot of great history in this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camelw1
40,Interesting if you have an hour,Visited Mels next door to rest the feet after the walk of fame.Our reciept entitled us to a discount so we thought why not.Interesting collection of what seemed to be authentic items displayed in a lovely old building. We like the fact that the museum comes across as an enthusiasts collection more than a big corporate money maker.Marilyn exhibs were our favourite of course.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fordwater
30,Must see in Hollywood,"We used our Go LA Card to get in and the lady at the front desk, whose name i forgot to get was super friendly and helpful giving us advice on where to start. Anyone coming to LA, you gotta check this out.ll of memorabilia that she has lovingly saved for decades hoping you will appreciate it too. The building itself is wonderful early 20th century architecture. If you love old Hollywood movies, vintage costumes, makeup and fashion, you will enjoy this as much as I did. There are also items on display from more recent films and TV, cars and some early film equipment. We spent a couple of hours and had a great time.o many different things for people of all ages, from movie stars of the 30s and 40s right up to modern day stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyrilp679
40,Friendly Staff and Fun to Explore,We did Mel's Drive In and saw the coupon offer for the museum and decided to take the tour. Was fun to walk through the floors and see the posters/exhibits. Took about an hour for us to go through the entire thing. Staff was very friendly as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofche001
40,Cool stuff,"Mixed bag here, but a lot of really iconic and historic exhibits are here. They also have special showings....definitely worth it, and MUCH better than Guinness or Ripley's. check it out if you are any measure of a movie fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
40,Nice classic stuff,This was a nice museum to tour . It had a lot of history in this place and the employees where nice. They also mixed a lot of old and new in the museum it was really cool .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jahmai
50,another good experience.,"First off, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Mr. Kenneth Horn, a gentleman who showed my dad and I around and helped me out with the elevator so I would not have to worry about the stairs. He was so professional and really knew his stuff. I really enjoyed hearing about the items on display and the history of the building itself. I cannot wait to come here again because it was totally different from last year-the displays change frequently so there is always something new to see. Some of my favorites were the dressing rooms for Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball. I love how passionate the curators are about this beautiful iconic place that was home to many of Hollywood's elite. So very glad I could share this amazing place with my dad. I really enjoyed being here and cannot thank you all enough. What a great museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
50,A Must See if You Have an Interest in Hollywood History,"This is a must see attraction. Located in the old Max Factor building this houses many of the classic costumes, props and sets from multiple films and television shows. Not to mention the actual car from North by Northwest. The building itself includes the division for redheads, brunettes, and blondes and their specific needs. It is a wonderful glimpse at the back end of how things were and are done. Well worth the cost and time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smackie66
50,must see,"The building itself is historic, the Max Factor building is where he and his staff made Hollywood stars shine. The building now houses a fantastic collection of Hollywood history. I do not like museums generally, but spent over 2 hours here, and would go again. Old and new Hollywood combine, memories of your childhood return, and you leave feeling you just saw something special. Skip the attached restaurant, a rip off with terrible food, but I would have a milkshake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveljo1988
40,Interesting place to visit,"This is an option when you purchase the hollywood explorer pass, so we decided to go to this museum vs going to the Dolby Theater tour. Very old hollywood and pretty cool to see the max factor exhibit and also the horror sets which are in the basement. They also do have the props etc from current shows upstairs. The place does smell old, but its worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venisonking
40,Worth a look,Worth having a look at this one. It is on the Go Pass so decided to have a look. It is the old Max Factor building and there is a small movie playing on the history. I also liked that there were bathrooms on each floor. There is a lot of history in the building with lots of displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneA63
30,Old Hollywood,I enjoyed seeing the old photos of the legends of Hollywood. I enjoyed the truck of the Beverly Hillbillies and the stars in it. I appreciate they have bathrooms on all floors of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarlindaK
40,Glad we walked in!,"We hadn't planned on visiting but decided to pop in after walking past on a hot day! Well worth the admission price. The Silence of the Lambs section is great. Great for TV fans, especially with the Emmy section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ioia123
40,Nice few hours,"This is a very nice way to spend a few hours if you are a movie or TV buff. The museum is located inside the old Max Factor Building. That in itself is very interesting. Kind of goes through the history of Max Factor. As you go from room to room numerous objects of memorable importance to makeup and making movies expands.One room is dedicated to old photographs of Los Angeles and Hollywood. Huge collection. That room was fascinating. Another interest in the building itself is the elevator. The elevator to get to the 2nd and 3rd floor is the size of a room. Literally, a room and two stories high. It opens with a garage door. The museum connects to Mel's Diner. That's another story. All in all a nice few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flhappy
40,Old world charm,Looking for something to do I stumbled onto this museum in Hollywood. I've lived in Los Angeles all my life and never noticed it before. My boyfriend is a film editor and i thought this would be a fun way to spend our Sunday.There was a great collection of movie memorabilia from photos and costumes to props. It was located in the old max factor makeup building so a lot of the info including a theater with a small film centered around max factor and his revolutionary makeup and how it affected the movie business.My favorite part was the basement because it centered on horror films. They even had a replica of Hannibal lectures jail cell from the movie silence of the lambs.If anyone is interested in movie history this is the place to go. There are 3 floors to explore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H20gurl
40,Solo Female Traveler,"A hidden gem. Go to the second floor to the Marilyn Monroe exhibit, you won't be sorry. I took over 2 hours on the 2nd floor. It is right behind Ripley's Believe It Or Not and Mel's Diner is on the other side of it right off Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGurl1

40,Underwhelming,"There's lots of memorabilia in this museum but apart from the Marilyn Monroe section it felt a bit over-cluttered and there weren't a lot of big, memorable items. Some of the dresses weren't wearing well either - it's a shame because I think some of the really good items are lost amongst the kitschier ones",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barley3487
50,Fascinating for movie buffs,"The attraction holds many highlights of Hollywood's history, including a pair of Dorothy's slippers and Hannibal's cell. There are many different costumes and set pieces from a wide variety of movies. There are also many different signed photos and other memorabilia.Also, there is an entire exhibit dedicated to Marilyn Monroe that any fan will find fascinating. This includes many costume pieces as well as some her personal affects. This exhibit alone is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanRuby
50,"Dorothy's Slippers, Superman's Cape, Hannibal's Jail Cell","I've visited twice, most recently with my classic film buff uncle in tow. Located in the old Max Factor building across the street from Hollywood High School, this is an unheralded gem. The first floor has movie memorabilia in what used to be make-up merchandise cases -- including Dorothy's ruby red slippers from ""The Wizard of Oz."" You can see a filmstrip about how make-up was introduced to American women and the brilliant marketing that went into popularizing it. There are make-up rooms for various hair colors, with movie photos and memorabilia from the appropriate film stars (Lucille Ball for redheads, of course). One floor is entirely devoted to Marilyn Monroe memorabilia - they have an extensive collection. Another floor has a wide array of TV and movie costumes, props, ads, film equipment, etc., along with excellent explanatory plaques. On my most recent visit, there was a temporary exhibit about portrayals of lesbians and gays in film. The basement, my least favorite, is devoted to horror films. Even the elevator is interesting -- it's a huge freight elevator with movie memorabilia of its own. Don't miss this museum while you're visiting Hollywood. BTW, easy and convenient parking in the Mel's Diner parking lot, and there's a handicapped lift to the Museum from the lobby of Mel's Diner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SML-Travels

50,Must visit,If you are a moview liker then you must visit either you will miss a lot. i have visited here and enjoyed too. pleasant atmosphere no noisy . Lots of cool thing have there to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/admsn
50,Finally- a nod to classic Hollywood,Hollywood seems to have forgotten it has a golden history- We were disappointed to find precious few classic-film themed activities. But this was perfect. Admission was reasonable (15 per adult). One floor was all of Marilyn Monroe's costumes and history- could have spent all my time there. Very warm tribute to a classic star. One floor was a tribute to gay/lesbian actors and roles and one floor was dedicated to film horror (which my daughter loved). The main floor was a tribute to Lucille Ball and Max Factor and lots of great things to see.A nice hour or two if you're looking for something fun as a film history or classic film buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zachris
50,Must see,"This is a must see experience, from costumes, information , it ticks the boxes, the Marilyn Monroe exhibition is a must they even screen some like it hot! The story behind max factor was so interesting, there are four floors to visit and every floor has something to capture your attention, one of the most interesting attractions and very reasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnH699
50,Very cool and not scary!,We were in LA for the first time and I was keen to have a look at the Hollywood Museum that has many original costumes from the movies. It is in the old Max Factor building. If you have a Starline bus pass be sure to show this when getting your tickets as they have a show and save discount. The lady explained that there was 4 floors for us to explore including the basement which was dedicated to horror films. The lady could tell I was freaked out when she said that but went on to tell me that nothing jumps out and they have part of the set from Silence of the Lambs down there to walk through as well. We went down to the basement and I was still a little scared. There was horror music playing to add to the atmosphere and it was dark as well. The costumes were so cool and I relaxed once I'd got down there and was mesmerised by the costumes. The Silence of the Lambs set was very cool. You got to walk through the cells and they had different things from the movie in them. There was an entire floor dedicated to Marilyn Munro and we both found this so interesting. We didn't know some of the strange circumstances surrounding her dealth. In particular the information on the house keeper and Marilyn's death. It was really nice to see some great costumes from both Hollywood past and present. They even had costumes from Orange is the New Black. I also found it very cool that there was a small cabinet containing Bruce Jenner's Weeties box and Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover. An enjoyable place to visit while in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantem_13
40,Fascinating Museum,"This is a great museum, stuffed full of memorabilia and fascinating facts and anecdotes for film fans. It is spread over four floors and there is something to appeal to most here. We were most interested in the movie make-up info and candid photos of 40s/50s movie stars on the ground floor, but there is more recent stuff here as well. The basement is horror themed and had a mock up of Hannibal Lecter's cell. On the top floor was a fun but wee bit chaotic display of LGBT Hollywood, part stories of the stars, part representation, part media/cultural studies, but some interesting info about lesser known figures. On the middle floor is a fab section dedicated to Marilyn Monroe and which includes candid pics and clips from loads of her films, and lots of cool info. Be warned though, they play Some Like It Hot on a loop so try not to get distracted; I sat there ages, got hooked and lost track of time. The only reason it gets 4 not 5 stars is because, bafflingly, there is no gift shop, which is really disappointing as some postcards of pics of old stars would have been great. A bit of a fun gem, this place - you'll need 2/3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2823RUchrisa
30,Museum,"This museum is very interesting if you're into movies, but is a bit limited. Lots of stuff on Max Factor makeup, Horror movies, Marilyn Monroe and LGBT connections, but not a lot of anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lubbaloo
40,A somewhat minor museum,"This is a somewhat minor museum, with a lot of Hollywood props, costumes and other artefacts. This is certainly of huge interest to movie buffs but others may steer clear. Some of the exhibits seem to be made up ones (such as Hannibal Lecter's cell), but others, such as the one going on currently on Marilyn Monroe are actually quite incredible. Don't buy tickets online and pay full price; you can negotiate better prices at the gate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lecyrnos1
40,Great for film fans,"We visited the museum as we had the GO LA card, the museum itself was very interesting. If anyone is a Marilyn Monroe fun there is a whole floor dedicated to her. I liked the basement where they had Hannibal's cell!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647davep

40,Great for Old Hollywood & Marilyn Fans,"Would you like to learn more about how stars like Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball got their signature hair and makeup?

This low key museum is the place for you. This is not a slick museum so the signs and displays are somewhat dated, but that is okay. It keeps the prices affordable and after all it is in the historic Max Factor building so it is nice to stay true to the the time period. After visiting I wanted to learn even more about Max Factor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulamama
50,If you are a old movie buff; you have to visit.,"Not to be confused with The Hollywood Wax Museum, which is just around the corner on Hollywood Blvd.Absolutely brilliant; set in the historic Max Factor building, set out over a couple of levels, beautifully set out and well displayed items, fabulous costumes, and all sorts of memorabillia. Each item has good notes attached and we spent a couple of hours wandering through the building, in a world of yesteryears. The history of Max Factor and the items displayed in this room is very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussCanberra
40,Best for older people or young people who love older movies,I loved looking around this place but my husband and 3 teenagers got bored quickly. There are many rooms and floors to explore. I would definitely recommend this for movie buffs but maybe send your teenagers elsewhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylH396
50,Coolest museum ever,"When you read the description of this museum it really doesn't do it justice. This has so many rooms each with a different character. The first floor is mainly makeup but so much more. There is a Lucy area, Marilyn area, so many costumes and dresses. The basement level has the more macabre items and pieces from movie sets. Super interesting and quite inexpensive. You could easily spend several hours here. Real close to the Hollywood Stars and the Dolby Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diane1024
40,Hollywood Museum- visit the stars,"It is a cinemaphiles dream, with an interesting movie on Max Factor, and a whole room devoted to Marilyn Monroe, and a room devoted to Lucille Ball. Some of the artifacts are invaluable, and I loved the Beverly Hillbillies vehicle, not to mention full Marilyn monroe movies. The sci fi and horror areas were a disappointment, unless you were a fan of Planet of the Apes and a few other movies. The horror area was the most disapointing, but overall, the museum was one of the highlights of my trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tortuga_gente
50,What a pleasant surprise,We had read about this one and had eaten at the restaurant next door a few times. Never thought it would be that interesting due to the changing nature of the area. Most of the fun and educational venues have become souvenir stores. Definitely not the case here. The entrance is deceptive as there are multiple levels and when we went they featured an entire floor to a Marilyn Monroe exhibit. This is a must see when in Hollywood. Plan to spend a few hours just viewing movie memorabilia as well as reading about Hollywood and Max Factor's role in all of it (Housed in the old Max Factor building.) I would go again just read more and see ALL of the pictures and exhibits. They allow non-flash photography as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barcodeVegas
40,Memorable Museum,"Stumbled on this building by chance as we were walking to Graumann's Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Stars.I'm a huge MM fan so great to see so much memorabilia.However what was of particular interest was the history behind Max Factor makeup - how it got started, who it was used on, etc.Loved all the items from the very early days - silent era.Laughed to see arch rival gossip columnists, Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, personal items, displayed across the room from each other.So much to see. So glad we didn't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nle69
50,Visit or miss out,"Brilliant, so many interesting articles and displays in one building. There is one floor completely dedicated to Marilyn Munroe . There are four floors full of exhibits and paraphernalia from loads of early movies and the present. They have organised them in categories and displayed them for all to see. I was impressed with the amount of stars autographs that someone had donated and there were heaps and so well displayed. Well worth a visit but leave at least 3 hours as time flies whilst you are engrossed in viewing everything of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenL408
40,Mandatory for film lovers,"Being true and devoted film lovers one Saturday afternoon we decided to go to this museum. Although not huge, it's absolutely packed with memorabilia from films ranging from old classics to movies being made today. When we went we were specifically going to see the Marilyn Monroe exhibit, which I enjoyed very much. Lots of dresses she wore, posters, pictures and even some of the personal items from her home. Other exhibits were were just as interesting with photos, props, costumes and more.What I didn't like was that this building was not designed to be a museum. It's numerous rooms and annexes left you feeling lost and wondering if you saw everything. There's so much in this museum it's hard to see it all and they do not offer a map.Other than that I enjoyed it and will watch for other exhibits in the future and will go back. Read more about my adventure and see more photos at http://victoriafreemanphotography.com/2015/06/22/my-hollywood-birthday/Or at VickiTravels.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaPics
50,Wasn't Going To But Glad We DID!,We had the LA Go Card and wasn't planning on going to the Hollywood Museum but were were glad we did. It has a lot of hollywood and movie memorbilia including the Dorothy's ruby shoes from the Wizard of Oz. We like the monster room downstairs which was creepy but exciting. The Marilyn Monroe exhibit was cool and my husband enjoyed her naked photos : ) I highly recommend this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinsU4081OY
40,fantastic museum for the movie lover,visited here using our go la card fantastic museum held in the old max factor building.We both enjoyed it helps perhaps if you like films/old movie stars etc or you might not know who some of them are. Lots and lots of memorabilia from costumes/autographs and props.A good way to spend a couple of hours away from the hustle and bustle of the blvd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelboy71
50,Great place for true film lovers,"A wonderful place for true film buffs. We loved the photos, exhibits, artifacts. There is lots of stuff and it's all very meaningful for,lovers,of film and history, The exhibits on Marilyn Monroe and glut Hollywood were both intelligent and well done. Museum was empty and quiet and a wonderful oasis in an overly commercialized neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuietTourist
40,Packed with Memorabilia,"Interesting on the whole, packed with memorabilia and interesting tidbits from various celebrities through the decades. It had a lot of focus on classic Hollywood stars but it also featured recent stars and movies. I think it was worth the $15, considering that I spent about 75 minutes there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikekowalczyk
30,Good for a time filler,Really good if you have sometime to fill. Tells you the history of some films in Hollywood including scary movies and movie make up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidIanCraw
40,Better Than Expected,We were attracted by an ad for the Marilyn Monroe exhibit and it did not disappoint. Lucille Ball and horror movie exhibits were very good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clayontheroad
40,A must see in LA,Normally I am not a big fan of museum. But I travel with my uncle and aunt so I have a chance to go inside to check it out the place. It is amazing more than I expect. I get more attractions and general knowledge more than I thought!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelygaggy
50,You must see!,It was the highlight of our trip! It is in the old Max Factor building and they have Marilyn Monroe and Lucy's makeup room! They also have a cool Sons of Anarchy display! Don't miss it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seashells79
40,"A surprising gem, definitely add it to your itinerary","I hadn't heard of this place prior to arriving in LA, however I saw an advertisement in a brochure and decided it would be a good way to fill time. Well, it certainly was!The amount of memorabillia in this museum is amazing, it's hard to believe it is a private collection.It is so close to the Hollywood & Highland Centre and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InfrequentFlyer22
50,Fantastic,I had an hour to wait for my bus and in passing I decided to enter this museum. I'm not really one for museums usually find them quite boring. BUT I was suprised at what I found inside. On the ground floor they had a marilyn Monroe section where they had her old dressing table and makeup. There was the wizard of Oz red shoes worn by judy garland. Downstairs in the basement there were settings and costumes from the flinstones cleopatra silence of the lambs and many many more. Upstairs they had a lot more marilynmonroe outfits and furniture from her house. Costumes and the car grom dreamgirls. I've been a couple of times now and each time I've been there there has been some impressive things to see. Rocky's famous boxing gloves michael jackson thriller costume. I ended up spending a couple of hours in the place and missed the bus that I was waiting for but it was well worth it. For a small price this place is one of los angeles hidden gems. As many activities in los angeles are very expensive. Have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unkn0wn11_11
30,Just OK and nothing more.,I wouldn't put this museum high on my list of things to do in the area. There were some interesting memorabilia items but there were way too many black and white photos without signatures as part of the display. I don't know if most of the outfits they had were originals or recreations as they were very careful about the wording describing them. At least a few made it clear they were reproductions. The building was kind of interesting in itself knowing the history and that every Hollywood star into the 50's had been in there at some point. If you find yourself with extra time and extra money or your just into everything Hollywood then give this museum a try.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coastermeister
40,The cool place to visit!,"Visited the museum with my son and daughter. My son enjoyed the movie props and costumes. My daughter was in awe of the make rooms used by the stars such as Marlilyn Monroe. There is a video about Max Factor, it is a bit dated, but worth watching. It takes an hour or so to view everything it depends on much time you want to take. It's a nice break from Hollywood blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmercase
40,Know hollywood,"Unless you are into old films, but I am not, lucky I know a little. However, still I think the museum is interesting, they tried to put in some new and updated props used by various movies and stars. The basement, which is the creepy one, is really scary to me, but is the highlight of the place, because it is good. They have jail, serving different purpose, similar those you saw on movies. I love Marilyn Monroe, and looking at the exhibits makes me understand more about her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanxinanna
40,Really sweet little museum!,"Visited this museum with my mum in early May. The tickets were only $15 each and gave access to the 4 levels that the museum is comprised of.The first floor you enter onto is an homage to Max Factor, one of the fathers of modern make up. I really enjoyed looking through the different rooms for blonds, brunettes, brownettes and redheads and reading the info on the starlets of each category. The blond room has some wonderful Marilyn Monroe memorabilia that I really enjoyed.There's also a great (although semi outdated) video about Max Factor and his life, influence and legacy. I missed the beginning of this but really enjoyed what I did get to see. I had no idea about his story so it was very enlightening.The two upper rooms have tonnes of movie and TV props and costumes which were pretty nifty. It was cool seeing outfits from some of my favourite shows such as Orphan Black, Mad Men etc.The basement is horror themed and is where all the horror memorabilia is housed. It was creepy and entertaining and good fun. They have the cell from Silence of the Lambs and costumes from Sweeney Todd. All very interesting stuff!We spent a couple of hours here just wandering around and reading the various information. It was a nice cruisy thing to do on a free afternoon we had. Would definitely recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyS399
40,Delightfully quirky,"Don't go expecting a polished, perfect, corporate experience. Do go with the feeling that you are visiting your elderly great aunt's basement, which is chock full of memorabilia that she has lovingly saved for decades hoping you will appreciate it too. The building itself is wonderful early 20th century architecture. If you love old Hollywood movies, vintage costumes, makeup and fashion, you will enjoy this as much as I did. There are also items on display from more recent films and TV, cars and some early film equipment. We spent a couple of hours and had a great time. A sign said that the creepy basement full of scary movie props was a former speakeasy. It's a total of 4 floors and there's a lot more inside than we were expecting. We really appreciated the effort make to keep these items intact and share some of the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CapricornSister
50,Breathtaking memorabilia,"This was the coolest adult adventure of the month.These displays, costumes, and the history of the building made the tour of the Hollywood Museum outstanding.This is not a kid adventure; if you're old enough to read, to remember 6-channel TV, you'll LOVE this place. There's Orphan Black and Walking Dead, there's Liz Taylor and Marilyn. This is the Max Factor building from Hollywood's heyday.I had a GREAT time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Senseicorykun
50,Interesting view into Hollywood films and TV through the ages!,"I absolutely LOVED this place! We visited here with our 3 young children who for the most part enjoyed the visit here too but it they were probably a little young for most of it. That said, they still enjoyed it!It's situated in the historical Max Factor building, in Hollywood.The Marilyn Monroe displays are the best I've seen, and the basement downstairs is a must see for any horror movie fan!!Would highly recommend!* We received a discount on entry because we had lunch at Mel's Diner next door prior to visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becs1981
20,Hollywood Museum,"Was really looking forward to this, but it turned out to be disappointing some of the displays sat askew in their cases some of the outfits were reproductions and the whole place had seen better days. I wouldn't put it on my to do list. not an A list attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daringth0rpe
50,Great place to see Hollywood History!,"Just went here with my family, immediate and extended. There were 7 of us in all and we all had great things to say about the place. I would make sure that you allow plenty of time. I could have stayed there a lot longer. Make sure to watch the movie about Max Factor and his influence on Hollywood. So much to see and may exciting props, dresses, pictures and so on. We felt it was so full that it was a little overwhelming. Can't say enough good and I hope to make a trip back some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristinM612
50,A must see,A must see 1 of a kind very unique and original museum in the original max factor building there is pictures cars dresses and movie props 4 floors every corner and every room filled here you get your moneys worth the hanibal lecture cell in the basment is worth it in itself,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
50,Must see in Hollywood for all ages!,"We recently visited The Hollywood Museum and really enjoyed the variety of movie memorabilia and interesting tidbits from very knowledgeable, friendly staff. The art deco in the original Max Factor Building is in itself interesting but the makeup rooms for stars like Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball are amazing. There is something for everyone here including the ""dungeon"" with the original set from Silence of the Lambs. The $15 admission fee is worth an hour or two of your time, and it's a block away from the other touristy Hollywood sights. Next door is Mel's Diner for a refreshing shake. Make time for The Hollywood Museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeM216
50,Original Max Factor Studio,Loved seeing the beginnings of makeup and hair color by Max Factor. Saw artifacts from many movies. 4 floors of awesome movies memorabilia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan48Maryland
50,The building alone is worth the visit.,"Loved this museum. The building alone is worth the visit, they have such an amazing collection of items, you can easily spend a couple of hours here. Very impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roomwithaview44
50,You MUST Visit This Museum!!!!,"Went to Hollywood museum yesterday and totally blew my mind. So many different things for people of all ages, from movie stars of the 30s and 40s right up to modern day stars and memorabilia. Loved the horror museum downstairs with Hannibal Lecters cell, Elvira display, Freddy Kreuger, Michael Myers from Halloween and Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. Also had heaps of Lucille Ball stuff who my mum is a huge fan of, along with Rocky's robe from the first movie, Indiana Jones stuff, the Beverly Hillbillies car and the Superman costume worn by Christopher Reeve. If you cant find something here you like you're pretty hard to please. And at only $15 its a bargain. We used our Go LA Card to get in and the lady at the front desk, whose name i forgot to get was super friendly and helpful giving us advice on where to start. Anyone coming to LA, you gotta check this out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregC33
40,Loved it!,"Had so much fun here, there are numerous rooms you can go and explore independently with information available if wanted. I've now got an amazing memory and lots of fabulous pictures!! I cannot remember if there is Wheelchair access... although I do remember falling down a huge flight of stairs (so check first!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20aimeer
50,Fun visit,Eclectic museum in the heart of Hollywood. Lots of artifacts and in the basement the prison cell from Silence of the Lambs. I do not think there is an elevator so check with the office. Part of the GO LA pass program. Mel's dine is next door and connects to the museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
50,Best Movie Memorabilia-Hannibal's Cell too!,My favorite thing we did in Hollywood. Kenneth Horn was our tour guide--great guy! He did makeup for films for over 30 years. He made the Jason mask!! SO many neat stories. You will not believe it but they have the exact set of Silence of the Lambs set. You get to walk into it! The have clothes and memorabilia from Star Wars-C3PO to the car from Nightcrawler! Sat on a church bench from the Exorcist! The museum is in the Max Factor studio and has all the history of the his work. Then you can eat in the Mel's Diner which is next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorifreeman
50,Favourite museum in Hollywood!,Absolutely loved the Hollywood Museum - it's so quirky and interesting. Full of old Hollywood glamour bits and bobs and film memorabilia. From Marilyn Monroe exhibits to the creepy Hannibal Lecter basement set to Grey's Anatomy & Baywatch costumes - it's got all sorts to look at.The lady at the front desk was great! - loved her.The milkshakes next door at Mel's diner were good too.We went in June and it was super quiet which was great for us.Definitely my favourite touristy museum in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessssssssssssssssss
50,A must for anyone visiting hollywood,"my wife and I were recently in Hollywood from Australia and we decided to check out The Hollywood Museum from seeing it on the tv show.. The Treasure King... and it didn't disappoint.. quite an amazing collection of costumes and old movie props. As a wheelchair user, the staff made it so easy for me to get around the museum. The Hannibal jail cell was definately the highlight",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181AndrewH
50,Do Not Miss this Attraction,"Housed in the old Max Factor (make-up artist to the stars) building, this 35,000 square foot 'non-profit' museum houses an extraordinary collection of historic Hollywood. The entire basement is dedicated to the history of horror. The Elvira and Dr. Hannibal Lecter exhibits were two of my favorites. The first, second, and third floors contain so much memorabilia, videos ,movies, and exhibits, you will eventually tire of saying 'OOH and AAH'. You can spend two hours or more enjoying the history of Hollywood. We did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenS379
50,interesting,"I decided to visit the museum due to the fact that I myself am a Marilyn Monroe fanatic. I loved seeing her original costumes, makeup, newspapers and original belongings. It was a delight to walk thru these hallways filled with Hollywoods history. Marilyn monroes black limo was a plus. The collection is absolutely amazing. Its a must see for old Hollywood lovers. There are no guides or anything you just walk around and read.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazminr2015
40,Really interesting place to visit,I really recommend visiting this museum. It has 4 levels of hollywood memorabilia that is really interesting to see.The front desk lady is amazing - to be honest the first time I walked past this place I thought she was a statue.Note - if you go on the hop on hop off bus you can get half price entry here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug2692
40,Nice Collection,I really loved seeing some of the authentic costumes as well as props from some of the classics movie. If you are a movie buff you will love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sj1991
50,Old Hollywood at its Best,"We visited here on our one day tour of Hollywood. Since my husband is a fan of old movies, I thought he would enjoy it. But, I have to say, I, too, found it very interesting. All the staff that we encountered, starting with the lady at the reception desk, were very friendly. Admission was $12. It is all self guided, with several floors to visit. The first floor is really dedicated to Max Factor. It is fascinating to see the make up tools that were used on Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe. There is also a movie about Max Factor that shows the influence that he had on the film industry and star making. Other displays were about a little bit of everything in Hollywood: television, emmy awards, horror movies. We did spend some time here. One thing that I would suggest to management, is that since so many people that are interested in old Hollywood are old themselves, it would be helpful to have some seating available. That is one of the reasons I watched the movie twice, so I could sit for awhile! It was a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QueenMimi
40,Interesting,This museum was included with our GO Card. I am not sure I would have gone to it otherwise. My 8-year-old daughter (our fashionista) loved seeing the elegant dresses on display from bygone eras.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m0ml0vest0travel
50,Delightful and interesting,Spent at least 2 hours here. We loved looking at the costumes and exhibits. Very interesting to see Marilyn Monroe's make-up box and outfits belonging to various folk. We were fortunate to have a chat with a man who worked there who used to do make-up at a movie studio. Fascinating!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanL531
50,Hollywood Nostalgia,"If you are into Hollywood history, this is a great place to visit. Small but packed with interesting things from many eras. The basement is totally creepy and if you are a fan of horror, worth the visit. We have been here on two trips to Hollywood - both times this museum was included as part of a pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyH447
50,by far the best,"what can i say....go!! if your a fan of old hollywood then go! the staff are extremely friendly, so much so that i saw one a few days later in a restaurant, they remembered me and came and said hello and to see how i was! so sweet, the museum itself is incredible, if your like me and a big fan of either Marilyn Monroe or Jean Harlow then go its incredible and full of so much stuff, from judy garland, to michael jackson to planet of the apes, they have it all, just to know your walking the same rooms as all the hollywood stars did is so speaical, beautiful place, beautiful things, beautiful people. loved every minute of if, a highlight of the year for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeb932
40,Good Musuem,"A good way to spend an hour or so looking at the mostly bygone days of Hollywood. Definitely more for the Baby Boomer than the younger generation as it is not hi tech, but if you an interest in movies and the history of Hollywood take it in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertH439
40,Great museum a little smaller than expected,This place is four or five floors dedicated to everything about movies. Lots of great memorabilia from various movies and television shows. I really liked the horror section in the basement it was the best part of the museum. It is also conveniently located near the Hollywood walk of fame and Chinese theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManiR986
40,"So much to see, great experience","We chose going to see the Hollywood Museum over the Grammy museum, mainly because I was much more enthusiastic about films and movies rather than music and the Grammys. I was not disappointed!Four floors jam packed full of information, costumes, videos, artefacts, props, and pictures, highlighting many great films, tv shows, and stars. It was very interesting to find out that the building used to be the Max Factor building originally. There were four rooms, each for the four different hair colours, all the way back to the 30s and 40s. There was a whole section on Ty Power, and Marilyn Monroe.Planet of the Apes, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, the Walking Dead, Hunger Games, Star Trek, The Silence of the Lambs, Frankenstein, and many more great films and shows were featured. Even (MY FAVOURITE) Lost, the tv show had a small exhibit, with a Dharma Initiative suit on display. The Dungeon was very cool, even for someone who is not a big fan or horror movies.I even loved the Bathrooms (the male bathrooms weren't as nice). They were big, spacious, green, and beautiful. The only negative thing I have to say about the museum is that it was quite crowded, and the people I went with seemed to think it was slightly disorganised, and a little overwhelming since there was so much to see.It was a great experience, and it was a good lesson on history too!! I would highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223alanam
40,Super great downstairs,We loveedd the horror section! It was so well done! Props! Although the upper sections for us were a bit boring. They have a great collection of old movies! Sadly we didnt know most of them. I believe a lot of people can really enjoy the museum knowing all those movies. But still a place worth going!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
30,smaller than expected,It is an interesting concept with the ground floor dedicated to Max Factor makeup and the stars of the past. The basement had a ghoulish tribute to horror films. Above ground were some costumes from film and TV that were fun to see. It was difficult to fill an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seabird21
50,Real nostalgia.,I was there and saw the Tyrone Power exhibit (you young-ins reading this if you don't know who he was you should). It was outstanding. Great pictures and memorabilia of an amazing career.Just being in the old Max Factor building is true old Hollywood.If we'd have had more time I would have loved to have seen the horror section.Definitely a fun place to explore and soak up Hollywood history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiesebastian1
40,hannibal,I went downstairs to the horror section & it was so good when I got my cousin to sit in clarissis chair...then I said ohh...they're missin the slide & then I saw it & moved it & freaked my cousin out. She jumped outta that chair...I laughed my head off...so did she when she realized it was me...lolthey also have what I thought was the original ruby red slippers...no explanation needed!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsymj
50,You have to go!!!!,"Located just around the corner from Hollywood Boulevard this impressive building houses some of the best movie memorabilia that we have ever seen! As you go in you see all the Max Factor stuff including Marilyn Monroe and other great Hollywood icons, then you can go down the stairs to the dungeon which is so brilliant you have to see it! Hannibal Lecter's cell Is fantastic!! There is so much to mention that you just hve to go, even the restrooms are worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeL247
50,Exceeded my expectations,"I had some time to kill before I had a tour so I used my GO LA card to go into the Museum.You can go through the old make up rooms as you start, but the as you go further in they have some really cool props out of movies.The best part was the horror dungeon which has the jail for Hannibal Lecter and some really cool horror props.Well worth the visit and would recommend everyone go through it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/312matthewl
40,Great Museum,It was so hot in LA that we decided to head to the Hollywood Museum and so glad we did. It has a great collection of movie artifacts from Laurel and Hardy right up to the latest Planet of the Apes film. It is a historic building where Marilyn Monroe used to have her make-up done in. Head to the basement for the horror section and it even has Hannibal Lector's cell from Silence of the Lambs. The museum is well worth a visit and then pop next door for a drink/food at Mel's diner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWombatTree
50,"Where Art, Science, and Hollywood History Meet","The Hollywood Museum is a very unique destination that combines art and science with Old [and sometimes New] Hollywood history.Three floors of the building are literally packed with excellent displays detailing Max Factor’s innovations and contributions that ultimately revolutionized the makeup industry, history of the 1914 building, and backgrounds of Hollywood stars from the birth of TV and motion pictures to present day including costumes, movie props, and personal effects.Of special interest: the free film that explores Max Factor’s life and career including the 4 first floor rooms devoted to the use of color and its impact on the motion picture industry.There are literally ""10,000 Show Biz Treasures"" as advertised on the street poster outside.Even the bathroom which is located on the first floor and to the left of the Planet of the Apes exhibit has an interesting background and contains period floor, sink fixtures, and architectural details within.Parking is available on North Highland adjacent to Mel’s Diner. Validate your ticket inside the museum and receive a discount.Discount on entrance admission is available with coupon inside Hollywood Museum brochure.Friendly and very knowledgeable gentleman awaits your entrance inside the building.Flash-less photography is allowed.Only one criticism: The use of Very Loud and Distracting soundtracks from various movies and TV shows throughout the museum.A visit here is highly recommended. I will definitely return. I was able to spend Only 2 1/2 hours here but will need more time to see and enjoy Everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46Lil
40,For movie lovers,I'm a movie lover and even though I thought the museum is a bit over rated. If you really really love movies you may find it worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178CarolL
40,Very interesting,"This museum gives you a detailed history of ‘Max Factor’, the early days of Hollywood and the current day. There is a Marilyn Monroe room, with a couple of dresses and items that belonged to her. The museum is really big and has different floors. Downstairs is the ‘dungeon’ with horror movie props and costumes. The variety of things is big which makes it interesting. It’s $15 for entry and is well worth it. The museum joins onto Mel’s Diner, which had nice food. Go for food first as you then get a discount on the museum entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadowed-raven
50,A must visit!!,Fabulous customer service and staff is knowledgeable. The museum has an amazing collection of Hollywood memorabilia. It was amazing to see the glamour and collection of Marilyn memorabilia. The museum has something for everyone!! My 15 year old daughter loved it! She couldn't believe they had items from PLL.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leighannhe
50,"If you love Hollywood history, you need to stop here!","I was greeted immediately by a friendly lady at the front desk in the main lobby of the former Max Factor Bldg. (now the Hollywood Museum). You get to see an array of memorabilia from the beginnings of Hollywood to current items and the displays change frequently. I am a HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan and was blown away by being able to walk into her actual dressing room and see her personal items like her USO tour dress, her make up chair and so much more. This room stuck out to me the most, followed by the Lucille Ball dressing room, and various items from Judy Garland, Audrey Hepburn, and more. Several floors and huge rooms of props, including the Beverly Hill Billies car and life size wax figures, The Little Rascals, Laurel and Hardy, Judy Garland's actual Ruby slippers from the Wizard of Oz this place is as exciting and incredible as any museum I've seen for the entertainment industry. I loved every minute of it and especially that Mel's Diner is in the same building is a huge plus. Well worth a visit and a must see for any Marilyn Monroe fan! Plan at least a half a day or more in this amazing place! Well done!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
40,Lots of nostalgia,"If you want see stuff from many classic movies, this is the place. Wonder through and enjoy. Don't forget the toilets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wheeleee
30,Bit of a mixed bag,"I pre booked a visit here based on some of the reviews I'd read, and I found it to be a bit....well mixed! Set out over several floors, the lower floor has the actual set of Hannibal Lectors cell, which was really cool and a bit spooky! The ground floor has loads of ""Old Hollywood"" photos and memorabilia relating to Marilyn Monroe and Max Factor and how they acheived her Hollywood style! The rest of it is wehre it kind of gets a mit muddled. For example, I wouldn't have expected to find costumes from Dancing with the Stars and High School Musical in there and I think they sort of spoilt the ""Old Hollywood"" feel of the place. I think it was worth the money to spend an hour or so in there, but it certainly wasn't the best place we visited. Combine it with Lunch at Mels diner next door, their chilli was really good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyofLeeds
50,Great piece of history,"We could have spent days looking through all the photos and reading all the information in this place! So much to see and so many interesting facts - well worth a visit, even if you're not normally a museum fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aodina
50,Great find,"This museum was next to Mel's drive in where we ate. We decided to try it out and we were pleasantly surprised. Much larger than it appears and has a lot of show biz history. Well worth the money, highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthTexanCowboyFan
30,Interesting... I guess,"A bit underwhelmed by it. While it does contain a lot of interesting historic artifacts (Superman's costume, Indiana Jones' diary), the layout of the 3 floors seemed a bit off.Can't quite say why it was underwhelming but a lot of the exhibits were a little heavy on textual details in small print. Additionally, the text on some displays was not formatted correctly and pictures overlapped or cut off some text.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmfronds
50,Glorious Hollywood,"This Museum is more, than it looks! I didn't expect much, but there are a lot to see! Old stuffs of Monroe and Lucy and Max Factor! They have a ""horror basement"" with costumes and other things from horrors, and other 3 floors of costumes and props from famous movies and series like Kill Bill, 127 hours, MIB, Modern Family, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Star Wars etc. A true movie lover will appreciate it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgama87
40,Great Way to Better Experience Hollywood,"If you're visiting Hollywood, this is a great place to enhance the experience. Lots of movie and TV exhibits, but for me the best part was seeing the older photos of Hollywood and LA.Right off the walk of stars, it's a easy way to spend a couple of hours away from the crowd on the strip. And a Mel's Diner is right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lzsrgh
50,Lots of Stuff,"This place was amazing, it had a tremendous amount of items and information on many famous stars including makeup rooms for brunettes, blondes and redheads. The building was owned by Max factor and he had many famous stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball and Rita Hayworth etc. who came for their makeup. This is where he manufactured his products and we rode upstairs in a old freight elevator. There were plenty of costumes and artifacts that were simply amazing to look at. They also ran many movie clips. Not expensive and you can spend as much time as you like. Don’t miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnaB9439NL
40,A hidden gem,"Just around the corner from the main strip, this little gem has many hidden secrets of the history of Hollywood and the connection with the makeup industry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tropicalpenguin
40,Must see for movie fans,"This is the place to go if you're a true fan of old Hollywood and its stars and want to walk down memory land. However, there is also memorabilia from more recent times. The exhibits encompass clothes and costumes, old photos, make-up, and personal belongings of many glamorous legends. The first floor is themed by leading ladies hair color with a room each for blonde, brunette, brownette, and red head. Accompanying the items are a history to gain insight into what went into creating the ""looks"". There are also rotating exhibits. What amazed me was how tiny many of the actresses and actors were or are. Overall its a comment on the illusion of films while not distracting from their allure. If anything, it enhanced my appreciation and love of those oldies but goodies.Please, note that there isn't an elevator and there are several floors of displays. I wish that there was a gift shop to augment the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la2nj
40,A Must for Any Movie Buff!,"The museum is inside the historic Max Factor Studio, with the original make up rooms, used by Marilyn Monroe and other hollywood stars. The museum has three floors and a basement area with many displays. This year, the museum had a floor dedicated to the Hal Roach Studios and Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang, Charlie Chase and other Roach stars. Hollywood was the location for the 19th International Sons of the Desert Convention (Laurel and Hardy), thus this museum was a logical stop for the entire Convention. However, the Hollywood Museum was much more than that.The main floor is a collection of make up sets by Max Factor for blondes, brunettes and so on; especially highlighted was an area devoted to Marylin Monroe, Liz Taylor, and others. Additionally, there are of lot of costumes from TV shows and films including ""Orange is the New Black,"" ""Modern Family,"" and there's also a tribute to Emmy winners like ""Breaking Bad"" and ""The Blacklist."" They have a horror section in the basement with interesting set ups from movies like ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" Harry Potter, and more! There are also film posters and life-size models of Frankenstein, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and so on, but the best bit of this was the actual prison set from ""Silence of the Lambs"" - yum! As you can tell, many of the displays are of ""older"" classical stars as Betty Davis, Joan Crawford, and so on. So, a younger demographic may not enjoy this as much, although there is Hannah Montana's dress! Still, it is interesting, and it certainly wont take up a lot of your day - around two hours minimum. The admission price is reasonable at $15. This is a must for any movie buff; I highly recommend stopping here when you visit Hollywood. It is right off the main drag right beside Mel's Diner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117carla
30,Hollywood Museum,"Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, although a little on the expensive side at $15 each. Probably a bit more enjoyable if you're a bit older than 28 as most of the 'stars' are of the previous generation's era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O7739ARthomass
30,not sure what I expected,"The Hollywood Museum contains a good collection of costumes and artifacts from movies past and present. maybe that was the problem for me. Its all well and good seeing Marilyn Monroe's cocktail dress, but to me its just a cocktail dress, and therefore not very interesting.I found the artifacts were displayed in a somewhat haphazard way, with no clear displays to explain easily what you were seeing. It required a bit of effort, (and my reading glasses which I hadn't brought with me) and on a hot Sunday afternoon (somewhat jetlagged) I simply didn't have the enthusiasmI also found it strange that so much was reserved for Elvira - rather dated now and not exactly a huge icon at her peak anyway - it felt, like a fair bit of the museum, like just a fillerIf this attraction hadn't been included on my GoLosAngelesCard I'd have been very disappointed to have paid for it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_fatdonut
40,Very interesting,"The museum is inside the historic Max Factor studio, with the original make up rooms, used by Marilyn Munroe and other hollywood stars. 3 floors and a basement room lots of costumes from tv shows and films including, orange is the new black, modern family, Harry Potter, silence of the Lambs, hunger Games, to name a few.Lots to see and well worth a visit, there is a diner next door for a drink when you have finished",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rumours1
50,Hollywood or Makeup Lover Rejoice!,"This is the place for you if you are into makeup and cosmetics. The Max Factor exhibits throughout the first floor are beyond amazing. The sheer volume of old makeup from the 30s, 40s etc is mind boggling. Then you see the other floors and the modern day Hollywood memorabilia from recent shows such as Breaking Bad, Greys Anatomy, Days of our Lives... the list goes on and on. I most of all enjoyed the prison corridor from Silence of The Lambs. Very spooky to walk through the actual set.Overall, it certainly wont take up a lot of your day, but its a great fun place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PolishJinx
30,You Might Like to Know......,The first floor was our favorite.....the rooms where the stars like Marilyn Monroe and Liz had their hair and make-up done.....Also you can see Marilyn's coroners report......there is a small theater with a movie following the life of Max Factor.......a very instrumental man in Hollywood history...You should be aware that there is quite a bit of emphasis on gays in entertainment past and present....Roddy McDowells pink bathroom is something to see....1 to 1 1/2 hrs should do it...$15.00 fee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnH-Castleberry
40,Lovely glimpse of old Hollywood!,"Such a cute museum! Tons of artifacts from 1950s/1960s Hollywood (so glamorous!), and even incorporates new, modern exhibits. We saw the Emmy nominees exhibit, which was so cool -- costumes and props from some of my favorite shows like Modern Family, Breaking Bad, and Orange is the New Black. They have a horror section in the basement, and really cool set ups from movies like Planet of the Apes, Jurassic Park, Pearl Harbor. There was also an exhibit about gays in the media, highlighting gay characters on TV. Great showcases all around! Would definitely recommend this stop just off of Hollywood Blvd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyJennyLo
50,So much fun!,"If you are visiting the Hollywood area, I highly recommend a stop at this delightful museum. It contains artifacts from old and new Hollywood. This year, the museum had a floor dedicated to the 2014 Emmy Nominations. It was so much fun walking around looking at costumes and artifacts from shows like Dancing with the Stars, Scandal, Breaking Bad, and more. The bottom floor is dedicated to horror movies. I truly enjoyed taking pictures and reading about each display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2Travel216
50,Worth a look,Had planned to see visit here and was worth while. If your a movie buff you will love all the memorabilia collected from many movies. Even our children enjoyed it! Definetly go if your in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzaT
50,Inspiring and educational,"3 floors. on each different theme. you must see collection of make up sets by Max Factor for blondes, brunnettes and browns and especially Marylin Monroe' ones. you may see first TV sets, all cameras there. you may see clothes and equipment used in lot's of great productions as well super popular TV series/ like Homeland or House of Cards. really worth of seeing. up to 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebuggy
40,Enjoyable Collection of Costumes/Props,"The tour is interesting in its collection of costumes and props. It may not be as interesting to young people because most of the exhibits are from the era of Betty Davis, Joan Crawford, etc. There are also a large number of older photos and autographs. Additional exhibits of items from newer, more popular movies would be nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drsyn2
50,An Unexpected Treasure Trove,"We nearly didn't bother with this Museum as it involved crossing roads, which is hard work in Hollywood. Glad we did though!We were met on reception by a lovely lady who gave us a really good deal for a family of 4, and advised us which way to go round.The ground floor was mainly make-up and frocks, Liz Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and dozens of other legends of the silver screen. Biggest thrill on this floor for my 16yo daughter was the dress from Hannah Montana the Movie.Down to the dungeon for the horrors. Film posters and life-size models of Frankenstein, Dracula etc, but the best bit of this was the actual prison set from Silence of the Lambs. It's eerie walking down the corridor with cells on either side and a strategically placed chair for Clarice Starling. Had to sit my wife down there while I whispered about fava beans in her ear.Up 2 floors to the comedy area. Hal Roach studios, Laurel and Hardy, Harold Lloyd and a wonderful history of comedy from the early days. There's also a tribute to Emmy winners like Breaking Bad and The Blacklist.Up another floor to celebrate the work of people behind the scenes and also the bravery of people struggling with their sexuality in the old days, and how cinema has come out of he closet more openly over the last 30 years. There's also the Beverly Hillbillies car containing waxworks of the characters which had me humming the theme tune for he rest of the day. Black gold, Texas tea, oil that is...There are lots of things to suit everyone here. TV screens running clips of he films or shows the exhibits align to. All in all, a very interesting couple of hours wandering around the museum. Thoroughly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAB_Royton
50,Should not be missed!,"The museum has such a wonderful variety of movie memorabilia. It has a great combination of old Hollywood items and new. The fact that you are standing in the same rooms that Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball, Elizabeth Taylor and Joan Crawford had their makeup done in gives you goose bumps. My husband's favorite part were the props from Indiana Jones. This is a must for any movie buff, I highly recommend stopping here when you visit Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scraphappy256
40,Great for movie buffs!,"This rather threadbare and worn-looking space turned out to be a great way to while away an hour or two while learning more about the Golden Age of Hollywood. There are tons of props, costumes and memorabilia, and the basement houses a fantastic horror film exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller88
50,Really nice place. Very Interesting !,"I wasn't sure how this would go over with our grandkids. But everyone really liked this museum. I was surprised how many current items were there as well as the typical 30's-60's items. We spent about 2 hours here and I felt that we could easily have spent another hour. Everything here is definitely authentic, and not just a copy of an authentic. This museum isn't exactly inexpensive, and you will probably have to pay for parking. But it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IverJohnson
50,"Easily overlooked, I'm glad I went in!","Having visited LA before, I was well acquainted with Hollywood Boulevard and its endless array of crappy stores, pushy street vendors, and tourist traps (Tussards, Ripley's, Hollywood and Highland etc) - so I've always given the Hollywood Museum a wide berth assuming it was yet another effort to milk money out of visitors - but based on some positive reviews I read, I decided to visit and was so glad I did - I was really surprised by the amount of authentic Hollywood history packed into that building, I thought it was fascinating and spent several hours there.Firstly the building itself is the former headquarters of Max Factor cosmetics, which in its prime created all the forms of make up used today (mascara, lipstick, etc) - they originally made these items for movie stars, to make them look good for the cameras. The ground floor has four small make up rooms painted in different colours, and based on the actresses skin tone and hair colour, Factor would put the actress in the room which best approximated what she would look like under studio lighting - everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Joan Crawford, Lucille Ball to Jane Russell sat in these rooms getting their make up done - the rooms are exactly the same as when they came here, so they are a little tired and worn - but they are authentic and original, which is very rare in Hollywood.The make rooms on the ground floor, plus two floors above and a basement underneath are all jam packed with memorabilia - and good memorabilia too, personal clothing and keepsakes (even cars) belonging to the big movie stars, signed photographs, props and costumes are everywhere - and while my first impression was that everything must have been collected from the old days, upon exploring the museum quite a large number of displays were sourced from the most current films and TV series - they had a display of the costumes used in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and that had only been released in cinemas a few days before!Being a movie buff I lost myself amongst the exhibits for hours, I especially liked the prison set from Silence of the Lambs. I enjoyed the experience very much, and obviously the displays get turned over on a regular basis, so I'll definitely visit the Hollywood Museum again in the future. Considering the amount of memorabilia and history within the museum, I thought the entry fee ($12) was entirely reasonable considering it’s the only place that you will see so many authentic props and items connected to some of the worlds most famous stars and movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKong
50,Wonderful if you're into this stuff,"I am a film buff and makeup artist, so to see a huge collection of Hollywood memorabilia and Max Factor stuff under one gorgeous roof is just the bee's knees. I spent a couple of hours here and easily could have spent more. If you're not into either of these things, why are you even coming here?I also saw some people saying the building looked a bit dirty- I thought the place was immaculate!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/907shanew
40,"Half an hour or half a day, there's plenty to see.",Make sue you visit this little gem so much memorabilia you can't believe it. There's lots to see so whether you have a casual interest or are a real movie buff I am sure you will love it. Make sure to check out the restrooms. They are unique. This is the old Max Factor building so worth a visit in its own right.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pickyperson910
40,Better than I expected,"My kids really wanted to go here for some reason, otherwise I doubt we would have went. However, I was surprised and enjoyed the exhibits, especially the Marilyn Monroe one. I do think they charge too much though, but I did have a 10% off coupon from eating at Mel's Drive In from next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TIA1966
10,Not worth the money,"I had been excited to see the Max Factor building and the memorabilia inside, but this place has a cheesy vibe and an odd collection of stuff.A few minutes into our walk around, my spidey senses started tingling and I began to suspect that I was looking at a lot if artful recreations of gowns and costumes rather than a collection of artifacts authentically owned by Marilyn, Lucy et al. The movie and TV costumes especially just didn't seem believable somehow. Perhaps it was the low-budget, B-list feel of the place. Maybe it was the fact that the accompanying photos seemed like pictures of very similar but not exactly the same clothes. Perhaps it was the fact that the signs didn't always even claim to be originals. And perhaps it was just my sudden epiphany that it wouldn't be that tough for a talented seamstress or seamster to make convincing replicas based on photos.I did like the incredibly extensive autograph collection of apparently-famous autograph collector Joe Ackerman, but you can see a lot of these autographs on photos hanging in local restaurants.And the old Max Factor building itself wasn't nearly as beautiful in its Art Deco splendor as I had hoped. It has seen better days.If this museum were cheaper, than it might be worth a quick peek, but for over $50 for our family of four, there are many things I'd rather buy with that money. And I'm a HUGE Marilyn Monroe buff.Save your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhcard22
50,A must see!,My son really loves movies and I noticed that this museum is only open Wednesday- Sunday so we made a point to go in that time period. We really enjoyed the movie about Max Factor and how he got into the Hollywood Make up business and then seeing the rooms where Lucy became a red head and Marilyn became a blonde. So cool to see all the other Hollywood props on display too. We really learned a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/515jackis
30,Lots of stuff,The museum was pretty decent. It had a LOT of movie props and trinkets. The best part was the dungeon and the silence of the lambs scene downstairs.Admission here is included in the GO LA card otherwise I would not have gone.Would recommend it if it was included but I wouldn't go out of my way to come visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frogster14
50,A lot to see,"This was a fun museum with many movie props and personal items that belonged to movie stars. The Marylin Monroe room is a huge room with so many of her personal things. They have her furniture, clothes, dishes, pictures, her car and more. Shirley Temple's costumes are adorable and they even have Roddy McDowell's bathroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK19792014
50,spend an hour,my partner and i visited when spending a few days in l a. great bits and pieces to see . a good range from max factor and breaking bad. loved the miss monroe and joan crawford bits. also the great james galdofini left his mark too. fab time was had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enncle
50,museum,one of the best entertainment museums i have seen spread over four floors it has something for everybody,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiedog01
50,Surprisingly good,"Very interesting museum located in the old Max Factor building, lots of info on Marilyn Monroe and other female stars. Even my husband enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoseB186
50,Great for the Movie Buff,"So much to see here if you love the movies and they let you take photos, really enjoyed it, allow enough time to take it all in, free with the LA Go card well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherelleo
20,Don't waste your money,So glad I didn't pat for this. It was part of the my Go LA card and we had some time to burn so we decided to go in and walk around. It was almost too much stuff crammed into this building and I'm not sure how much of it was authentic. It was interesting to look at but I think I would've been upset if I had bought a ticket for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wambo
30,Only if your a true Hollywood fan,"5 floors of Hollywood stuff...outfits, props, photos, and movie clips...some from older movies and some from newer ones. The ones I remember most were the Sopranos, Hunger Games, and Elvira. Lots of Marilyn Monroe and Michael Jackson stuff. You could wander around freely looking at the different exhibits. It took us about 30-45 minutes to do all floors. They have an elevator available but it's faster to take the stairs. Bring your camera so you can take pictures. I would have really liked this place if it was a little bit more organized or if they had a self-guided tour. If you are a true Hollywood fan, you will enjoy all the treasures to be seen. We went on a Thursday. The museum wasn't crowded and there was lots of self-parking lots available for a decent price on North Highland Avenue and a pretty good amount of street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iLive4Adventuring
40,Classic Hollywood,"Not too bad! A lot going on here. Has tons of photos, costumes and props. If you're into ""old glamour hollywood"" you're going to love this place, full of the classics. The place Marilyn got her hair dyed. Really neat stuff. It's full of tons of stuff will take some time to see and appreciate it all. I kind of just ran through it as I didn't have much time. The basement was cool as I'm more a horror fan so there was lots of neat stuff down there. A good place to check out for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
40,Full of classic cinema history,I fell in love the moment I saw the building. The museum is filled with artifacts that marked the Hollywood film industry. I stepped in the room where Marilyn Monroe first got her hair bleached; remarkable! I also had the chance to meet the man that helped design the initial mask of Michael Myers. It was a fantastic experience. And a goldmine for any old-hollywood and film lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandonST626
50,Stepping into Hollywood History,"The Hollywood Museum located in the historic Max Factor building is remarkable...and a good reminder that there was a Hollywood before Star Wars. The Max Factor building is also a historic cultural landmark loving restored to original condition by the owner. You visit rooms that once were used by great legends of Hollywood...Marilyn Monroe, Lucile Ball, Marlene Dietrich and many more...then there is the memorabilia of ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jronaldreed
30,Ok Museum,"I was excited to see this museum but was not very impressed. The museum is large itself with lots of artifacts - mainly costumes. I wish there was more to read about each exhibit, as the costumes and photos are displayed without explanation. I liked the architecture of the building. There are definitely new and old artifacts from the movies. We enjoyed visiting the Hannibal Lector's cell in the basement. The museum is located next to Mel's Drive In and adjacent to the Hollywood walk of fame and Grauman's Chinese theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmyMPLS
40,Interesting History,"Really interesting place (if you're a movie lover). Had some great pieces of Hollywood history, as well as pieces from newer films.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nina55555
40,It was pretty cool.,Some of the stuff was very cool (superman and rocky costumes) but a lot of the costumes and props were of little interest to me as a 29 year old man. I think it's definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of film and can appreciate the history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CriticalBrent
50,Hidden Gem of LA!!!!,"We live locally but never knew about this place until we bought a Groupon for it. What a pleasant surprise! We spent 2 hours there and loved it. Loved the Redhead room where Lucille Ball got her red hair! Lots of memorabilia, photos, props, costumes, cars. Lovely building, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarciaF7596
50,Worth it for the Lector cell!,"I found this museum very interesting, but the best bet was by far Hannibal Lector's cell from the silence of the lambs.There are lots of props (the holy grail from Indiana jones) and costumes.I don't think you need to be a massive movie buff to enjoy this museum.We got reduced entry through our hop on hop off bus tickets and I'm very glad we took the time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rasmanrulz
20,Only for the over 40's,"The whole idea of the Hollywood Museum is good, in that they're trying to showcase many treasures from the movies. They've achieved this for some old classics, but there was a real lack of anything new or relevant to younger people. I'm currently 30, and at least 2/3 of the museum was showcasing movies that I hadn't even heard of. It was interesting to see the movies that I was knowledgeable of, but when you're considering the cost to see this small portion of the museum, its a bit hard to recommend. However, its probably worth it if you're 40+ years old, or if you like classic black and white movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wattostudios
50,great few hours of history,"we paid a return visit ... we were the first ever visitors on opening day many years ago ... and were interested to see the changes , compared to other similar places this is a bargain $15 entrance and remember I think its self funding ... jam-packed full of nostalgia and Hollywood movie and tv history . we had to use the stairs as the lift was not in use which may have been an issue for some we were finesome ideas we had were a small coffee area to take a quick break would be nice as so much to see and may bring in extra revenue .. also maybe offer a guided tour at weekends ?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rjadam
50,Very surprising attraction,"I went to the museum after reading good reviews and I loved it. It is based in the original head quarters of Max Factor and the ground floor is dedicated to him and the firm he began. I learned a lot of interesting stuff about him, he was an innovator and experimenter which made him a success in his native Russia and later in USA. The 'dungeon' is set out like the Silence of the Lambs prison scene and is pretty spooky. The upper floors have lots of memorabilia from TV and films. It is well curated and there is plenty of information so you know what you're looking at. I used the bathroom only because so many stars had been there before and it still has the original fittings. We spent so long there we needed coffee, there is no cafe but we got our handsm stamped and went next door to Mel's Diner which is amazing. Recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyLS48
30,"Some neat stuff, some filler and almost TOO MUCH","We stopped in here somewhat on a whim and based on the reviews, that being said it was not a bad way to spend time but a little pricey for what there was. They have A LOT of stuff and some of it is pretty neat. The cell block for the Silence of the Lamb was interesting. But since they have SO much it is just kind of jumbled together. And this is where less would probably be more. My family was on overload once we left.If you like Lucille Ball or Marylin Monroe it would be a must see as there is a fair amount of stuff from them, expecially Lucille Ball. I had no idea that she was not a natural red head prior to my visit. But while they had a lot of items there was not a ""must see"" item there.And I agree with one of the earlier posts, there is a ton of Max factor stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffR488
40,Fun in Hollywood,"If you like movies, make sure you plan a visit to this museum. It is well organized and has a lot of interesting stuff. They have TVs showing scenes where the customs were used in several places.My favorite was the dungeon where they had the jail cell from Silence of the Lambs. You walk through the hallway to get to the cell just like in the movie. The dungeon also had horror movie stuff like Jason from Friday and 13th and Michael Myers.There were also lots of great costumes and effects from movies and TV shows from the past several decades. It was cool to see the robe and boxing gloves from the original Rocky.Great fun for movie fans!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
30,NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP,"This place has tons of neat things but need to be cleaned up a bit, some I question if it is real or reproductions. There are no staff to help or ask questions, this place needs new management and some direction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IMHUEY
40,Four Floors of Movie & TV Memorabilia,"Have four floors well organized and packed with Movie & TV Memorabilia, including cars. Some of the museum has a very dated feel to it, but overall a good stop right in the heart of the Hollywood attractions and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Lots of costumes, pictures, max factor makeup (this was a bit overdone), etc. I was as entertained as my partner was since I am not into this stuff as much, but I still enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indyboilerboy
30,Questionable items to see here,"This museum came so highly recommended that I actually bought a ticket as my Citypass' offer had been used for something else. 3 floors of movie stuff which is questionable at best. Having seen the original ruby slippers from the Smithsonian which are protected and put in a darkish spot, seeing the ones here made me wonder if they were real. They were exposed to light, not very protected. The basement is cool as it has Hannibal Lecter's cell but all the rest is questionable. Also, when I was there, the cleaner started cleaning the glass cases with bleach. Not something you want to be caught in the middle of during your visit. If you have a ticket, go for it. I wouldn't recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeLondon
50,Must do!,Excellent! had the costumes and props of most of the great movies. Had the ruby slippers and a Golden Age exhibition. I loved the red dragon bit - favourite movie!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassandraK777
40,Interesting Museum,Located on Highland Avenue just off of Hollywood Boulevard the Hollywood Museum is a gem. Four floors devoted to different time periods and themes tell an all around story of the rise of Hollywood. The first floor begins the tour with a movie and makeup exhibit devoted to Max Factor and his influence on Hollywood & the stars who used his products through the years.The 2nd & 3rd floors are devoted to movie and TV history with a smorgasbord of exhibits chronicling Hollywood stars and history.The basement is a Hollywood style dungeon featuring horror characters from the movies and TV.The Hollywood Museum is self guided and you go at your own pace. I took about an hour to visit all four floors. This was a great side trip that I really enjoyed. Two thumbs up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperRay
20,Ok but nothing that grabbed me,We visited as part of our Citypass ticket. I was a little disappointed. I guess if you were a big 'olden' movie fan this would be great. There were a few things that were interesting but the majority of displays were from the golden oldie movie era. My teenage son was bored. I really wanted to love it but just couldn't. If you are into the classic movies and the olden stars then this is right up your alley.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsutt35
50,The Golden Age of Hollywood,"This is a fantastic museum! It is housed within the old Max Factor building, and it is four floors of everything you wish to experience in Hollywood! The movie and television memorabilia will literally blow you away. It is located conveniently on the boulevard, and is close to plenty of other attractions. Make sure to put this one on your to do list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinationDiaries
20,"Boring, drab, outdated.","Yeah I get it, it's a museum - it's almost meant to be outdated. But it's not just that; history can be fun, but this museum presents all of the potentially exciting history of Hollywood in an unclean, dreary and depressing manner. Coming here was not worth it.It really needs a bit of a cleanup, and a revamp to be a little more exciting.Only takes about 30-minutes to an hour to cruise through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trannosaur
50,What A Gem!,"What a gem for ""old Hollywood"" movie fans. This was always on our ""to do"" list but was much better than we expected. Four floors of wonderful movie and television memorabilia housed in the old Max Factor building on Highland Ave., just off Hollywood Blvd.There is a whole floor devoted to Marilyn Monroe - fantastic - the most extensive collection anywhere. See the 'Blonde's Room' where a brunette Marilyn became a blonde.Don't miss the lower level dedicated to the horror film genre which includes Hannibal Lector's cell from 'Silence if the Lambs' to Boris Karloff's mummy.Highly recommend spending several hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LanieG60
50,Full of memorabillia,This museum is only open from Wednesday to Sunday from 10am - 5pm and costs $15 each entrance. It is chockablock full of history and movie/TV memorabillia. We were on a time limit of 2 hours but you could easily spend 3-4 hours here. There are hundreds of photo's to look at. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandiC930
40,Good but could be fantastic,"Great building (Max Factor) and history of his make up development etc but not really a great history of Hollywood. Lots of artefacts, photos about TV and film but not in depth history of Hollywood - really feel they are missing something here. Only $15 and I spent about 2 hours here so good value",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneHerts
40,Nice Collection,"The Hollywood Museum was included on our Go LA card, and I love memorabilia so we made the stop and spent a couple of hours. The place is packed with items from recent movies and shows and items from the past. I enjoyed the Max Factor color rooms, rooms with advertising and items for ladies of different hair colors, interesting to see all the fabulous stars that did advertising for Max Factor. You could easily spend 1/2 a day really looking at all the stuff, but we only had a couple of hours and 12 year old with us. Much of it she didn't know about, but she still enjoyed hearing us talking about things we remembered. Great Marilyn Monroe items. I especially liked the bottom floor with the ""Silence of the Lambs"" cell block, included some stuff from ""The Walking Dead"". Might not have been happy with the price of $15/person, but since it was included in our pass, it was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dme3
50,Very interesting,"If you're a sucker for Hollywood memorabilia like me, then this is a must-see. There were hundreds of personal items from stars like Marilyn Monroe and Lucile Ball, as well as props and costumes from movies and TV shows. My favorite part was the ""Silence of the Lambs"" set downstairs. Also, the lady at the front desk was very friendly and the old building it's in is very cool! And all this was only $12 (student ticket), a steal in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DD_Vols2013
30,An Interesting Stop,"My husband and I had time to kill before our tour and the Hollywood Museum was included on our Go card, so we decided to check it out. Neither of us are big fans of looking at props and costumes, but this was still worth a stop. If you DO like looking at props and costumes, this is a must-see for you. There are tons of props, costumes, pictures and other historical artifacts from celebs past and present (though mostly past).For us, the highlight was the cell block from Silence of the Lambs, which was transferred to the museum after the movie was shot. You can walk through the cell block, which is actually a little bit creepy. They also had several items on display from horror movies and television shows. Those displays were pretty cool, but I am not sure if they are all there year-round or if some were just there because of the Halloween season.If you are looking for a place to kill a bit of time without spending too much money, this is a pretty good place to visit. Without the Go card, I believe it is $15 per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91shannonk
40,Great collection of Hollywood memorabilia,"The museum takes guests from the beginning of Cinematography, to the the recent movies through the items that made the history of cinema. Go there and see the actual plexiglass cage of Hannibal Lector, the the actual '70s Superman costume and more than other 10000 Hollywood artifacts. Do not miss Marilyn Monroe's display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inusitatus
50,Great Place for Hollywood History,"A great museum located in the historic Max Factor Building just off Hollywood Blvd on Highland. Next door to Mel's Diner - a great place to eat. The Museum is a wonderful collection of Hollywood history - great display, thousands of movie star's autographs and photos, hundred of props, great staff, 4 floor of displays, too much to see in one visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wff5
40,Vintage History in Beautiful Building!,"I took my 16 year old to see this museum. The building itself which is the old ""Max Factor Building"" is worth a visit just for it's own history and Art deco features, it's truly beautiful and a relic of old Hollywood.A few of the highlights for us were the Lucille Ball items, the Jennie Bottle from ""I dream of Jennie"", and the Ruby Slippers worn by Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz""We loved seeing Marilyn Monroe's clothing and personal items as well.This place is CHOC A BLOCK full of items from many different movies and well worth a visit. We spent a really good couple of hours and the price was very reasonable for what you see inside.My one request is please move Marilyn's Car - It looked sad and left out where it was!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneDownUnder
50,Hollywood Museum Vintage History Buff Haven,"Went to the Hollywood Museum on a Sunday. My sister was visiting from Seattle and when we were younger we would go down to Hollywood and see movies at the Egyptian and Graumann's Chinese Theater. The Hollywood Museum is just a block away from Graumann's. We arrived around 10:00am and found parking on one of the blocks close by. The parking is metered and the parking rates are $2.00 an hour. Bring a credit card. We did see a few lots that had parking available for $10.00. The Museum is in the old Max Factor building. The entrance fee is reasonable. Adults $15.00 and Seniors $12.00. Max Factor built the building in 1927 and it had been renovated in the 1930's. There are four floors of artifacts and the ride up and down the elevator is one of the highlights. It has to be operated by one of the Museum staff. A lot of old photographs of stars from the 30's, 40's and 50's. Original make up rooms and history on Max Factor. If you are a history buff this museum will fit the bill. There are props and one of the floors is dedicated to Television. The old architecture of the building is quite appealing. We were there for about two and a half hours. Not a bad walk and very few stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanT930
40,More than expected!,"Some of the displays did not have any names to them left me wondering, some displays way to low to the ground to observe. Otherwise lots of good stuff- Marilyn,Lucy,max factor, Hannibal lector,even a little elvis. Takes quite awhile to see it all. Why no stooges stuff? The shorts were shot very nearby. Still would recommend highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSvin
40,Great place to visit set in a beautiful art-deco building,"This museum is fabulous value for money, where you get to see many props, costumes, sets, cars etc from golden age Hollywood, right up to present day (ish)...Seeing some of Marilyn's clothes, make up, bit n bobs was the highlight for me, but there are loads of great things to see. The Dungeon section was great fun!!! ;-) All of this set in a glorious art-deco styled building which appealed to me as well (being a fan of art-deco!), it ticked all of my boxes. The manager of the museum was a lovely lady as well and I wholeheartedly recommend a morning/afternoon spent there....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIRSTYRAW
50,Awesome Attraction,"This was a most pleasant surprise. My wife and daughter kept calling it the ""Max Factor"" Museum. I kept thinking, how interesting can makeup be?As it turns out, it was the most nostalgic experience I could have dreamed of. The focus is indeed Old Hollywood, Marilyn's Cadillac and all.It all nearly put me in a trance... The actual room Marilyn became a blonde in...and the room where Lucy was transformed into a redhead. Dorothy's red slippers are there and the front gate from Jayne Mansfield's mansion. Even Hannibal's padded cell is in the basement.I am anxious to get back and explore this place further.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/36sev
50,Great way to spend a few hours,This museum was really interesting but I actually loved the Marilyn Monroe exhibit the best and I am not even a huge fan. There is a whole floor dedicated to her and I just loved this part of the museum. But there are lots of props etc from a wide variety of movies and I really enjoyed my visit and would recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sooziegirl
30,Great place to visit,"This a lovely museum, loved the Marilyn Monroe section with all the make up and her dresses. Downstairs is fun they a spooky section a lot based around silence of the lambs, great displays throughout the museum.I went solo and did not take me long to walk around it. Good price and the person running the museum is really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyC781
50,SO INTERESTING,"This is a great place! We had no idea of the history of this building, etc. until we talked to one of the museum staff at the end of our visit. They are working on the 2nd floor display right now which sounds as if it will be fabulous. This was the old Max Factor building where all the stars crossed the threshold to have their make up applied. The basement is the actual set from the Silence of the Lambs with even the folding chair in front of the cell. Take as many pictures as you want, but be sure and bring your memory as there are lots of stars which might not be know to some younger individuals. The make up rooms on the first floor were for the ladies...and the color of each of the rooms was to make their complexion and hair color ""pop"" when they were on camera...like green on the walls in the room where red heads were made up...so interesting. Lots and lots of memorabilia from so many movies and stars from the past and even the recent present...Highly recommended. Plan to spend a lot of time just looking and absorbing all this collection has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneD306
50,Excellent Old Hollywood Museum,"The building itself is a treasure and it's a miracle it's golden age interior has survived into the 21st century. Stepping into the lobby and main ground floor rooms give you a feeling of what it must have been like back in the day, very stylish. The building is full of interesting exhibits of costumes, props, make up paraphernalia, autographs and more that span the history of Hollywood film making. There's an entire floor devoted to Marilyn Monroe. The basement has the set where Hannibal Lector was held captive in 'Silence of the Lambs'. We very much enjoyed this place. It's one of the few surviving bits of real old Hollywood and the biggest/best museum of old Hollywood in town. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artistpaul
40,Great Museum in Historic Building,A very nice museum of Hollywood/entertainment memorabilia in the old Max Factor building. I also enjoyed learning about Max Factor; quite a story.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/315elizabethh
50,"Great building,great exhibits","I love seeing modern history preserved as so many 20th century things are thought of as throw away but this building is a great piece of Hollywood history.The old Max Factor building has the same lobby,stairways,even the ladies loos have been preserved!.Its like stepping back in time.Its amazing to see the newspapers in the Jean Harlow exhibit with front page headlines of her death in 1937.Someone must have really looked after those all this time.My husband loved the Hannibal Lector cell which is the original rebuilt in the basement.Marilyns outfit she wore to entertain the troops in Korea plus one of her Pucci tops are here plus so many other things.I loved the huge original framed movie posters.would look great in my lounge!If you love old Hollywood like me then you will love this place.By the way Mels Diner is right next door,thats another great Hollywood iconic place.Re-live the golden age at both of these venues!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/april268
20,high potential but very bad location,"there are some very interesting things in the museum, but I didn' t like the display. Things were all grouped on the walls or on the shelves, and it was a bit confusing. The Marilyn Monroe exhibitis so interesting. To see her personal things and some of her correspondence, it' s a bit moving.I think the location should be modernized and it smells a little bit of old.Overall I think that For the numbers of things they have, the location is too small.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioNer944
40,Great and Cheesy Museum,"This is a great museum to see any of the historical artifacts from Hollywood's past. The only problem with this museum is that it isn't comprehensive enough to cover all of the artifacts of Hollywood, which is hard to do given that a lot of those items are owned by the studios and by private hands. Still, this is a museum that is very cheesy, fun and informative. This is also close to the other Hollywood attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG199
40,Hollywoods golden age!,"So pleased I managed to squeeze in a trip here before motoring on up the coast. If like me you love the golden age of Hollywood and it's fabulous stars, this is the place for you. Set in the old Max Factor building, where the stars would get their beauty treatments - this place is full of nostalgia. Some of the exhibits look a bit tired but they tend to be the ones from the more modern films. I was fascinated with the costumes, Bette Davis' favourite shoes and handbag, Marilyn's Italian silk tops. I could have spent much longer loitering over the exhibits. Don't forget to use the toilets. The ladies is pretty much as they were way back when, wonderful authentic décor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/497carolinel
50,Fantastic,"Absolutely loved this place - so much to see and read about - spent the whole afternoon there! Fabulous collection of Hollywood memorabilia, photos, costumes and personal items and loved the Marilyn Monroe section best of all. Definitely recommend a visit if you're fascinated by Hollywood and its wonderful past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureenf434
30,Decent Museum,"The Hollywood Museum, located right off of Hollywood Blvd., was built right in the historic Max Factor building. There are all sorts of Hollywood memorabilia in here from various movies and TV shows. While the organization of it is is kind of all over the place, it's definitely a fun visit to reminisce on some of your favorite Hollywood productions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GNRMatt
30,nice museum,"This museum has memorabilia from films and TV shows. Most of them were older, but there were a few more recent shows. It is mostly costumes and photographs. Most of the celebrities featured were names that I had heard of but wasn't at all familiar with. There were some interesting letters and memorabilia in the Marilyn Monroe exhibit which was one whole floor of the museum. It's a nice museum if you have some extra time to spend in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquamarina5775
30,Interesting ..informative,We visited the Hollywood Museum to offer an historical perspective to our Hollywood visit .It did not disappoint .The Max Factor component was interesting as was the extensive Marilyn Munroe display .I was left wondering if some of the displays were recreations or legitimate pieces of Hollywood history .The display cards adjacent to the displays could be a little more specific ..just saying .Worth a visit ..especially if you have a coupon or a GO LA card,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
30,"Very interesting, especially if you like Old Hollywood","This seemed to be two museums in one - the most interesting part is related to Max Factor (the museum is in the original Max Factor building) and the role he had in Hollywood. He has a very interesting story, and there is a lot of exhibits showcasing this. There are exhibits related to the history of Hollywood and a lot of photos from the vintage days of Hollywood. They had a Marilyn Monroe exhibition which was very well done.Then there are exhibits related to newer movies. Some of them are popular, well-known movies, but many seem to be from lesser known ones. In some cases, the costumes aren't authentic (in trying to say they had a Harry Potter exhibit, they had replica costumes made just for the museum). So the exhibits here are more hit-and-miss.If you appreciate Hollywood from the early-mid 20th century, or want to know more about it, it is definitely worth a visit. If your primary interest is in modern movies, or have kids that don't know the older movies, it won't be as interesting.The location is right in the heart of Hollywood, and we were able to see the museum in about 2-3 hours. So you don't need to go out of your way to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KDAA
40,Nice Surprise,"We stopped here before a play at the Pantages. What a nice surprise! If you're a real film and TV fan, you'll most likely enjoy this and there seems to be something for everyone. The displays start with silent films and cover the gambit. The Marilyn Monroe special exhibit takes up one whole floor and had objects from her films and personal life. Highlights for us were the Lucille Ball room, objects and/or costumes from Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Moulin Rouge, Wizard of Oz, Kung Fu, Rocky, Sweeney Todd, All About Eve...wait, there were too many highlights to even begin a list. There are tons of artifacts, nicely displayed, the staff is welcoming and helpful, and it's a fun outing. We spent a few hours and saw all four floors. If stairs are difficult, ask to use the huge elevator. Have fun! We did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
50,Loved all the memorabilia!,"This museum I enjoyed the most. It was cool seeing costumes from movies like Star Trek, the Flintstones and saw the prison cell from Silence of the Lambs, spooky!! Lots of different costumes from big movie stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cay2004
30,bored,"Thought this would be really good, not so much though. Very boring. Lots of photos and makeup. Some props but not enough to get excited. If you are old like 60's plus, you might like it more because of the movie pictures they have and stuff. Overall a waste of time and money. They really try to play it up with ""4 floors"" and the the Harry Potter collection, but very weak.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhR4757OG
30,"Good, especially for the fans of older movies","If you're into movies from the 1930's to 1960's, then this is the place for you. If you're more of a modern movie fan, then this place will be a bit lacking. Not that there's nothing for modern fans, but the collection really focuses on the older movies. An entire floor is devoted to Marilyn Monroe, so if you're a fan, you will have a lot to enjoy. The basement has the most interesting collection, including a mock up of Hannibel Lector's cell from Silence of the Lambs. There are many scary things down there. My 5 and 12 year olds didn't even make it down the stairs. In conclusion, you're experience in this museum will depend on what type of movies you like. For the general movie buff of movies from all eras, you'll love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cool_teacher590
50,How The Hollywood Stars Were Made Glamourous,"This museum in located in the old Max Factor Make-Up Studio. There are four floors and on the first I was delighted to see all the pink display cases full of old Max Factor products. Their art deco graphic designs were exquisite and alongside were movie magazine articles and publicty stills of actresses using his products. Of course, they were ultra glamourous. He perfected the art of “greese paints” for the movies but he also had make-up for the everyday woman who wanted to look like the stars. There were make-up rooms catering to blondes, brunettes and redheads. I sat at a makeup table and had my photo taken. The third floor contained displays for Jean Harlow and Marilyn Monroe. There was also old move projectors and cameras along with colorful movie posters, props, scripts, personal artifacts and even a guest bathroom from Roddy McDowell’s home. We stayed a long time and could have stayed longer as there is so much to take in. The basement featured collections on sorcery, ie, Harry Potter, etc. that I wasn’t interested in. If you're visiting Hollywood, DO NOT miss this museum but I do feel it's for adults since it caters to old-movie history of which young children and teens will not identify.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yumaborn
50,MUST SEE!,"If you are a movie lover you must see this place! Old Hollywood glam, historic place and great people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tl4tl
50,A walk through time,"YOU MUST VISIT THIS MUSEUM , My Wife who loves the black and white movies and everything old hollywood , and you can see the upto date stuff as well, this museum is a walk back in time. We spent hours in this great place its a must if your into a walk back in time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iloveholidays0261
30,A bit outdated,It was ok but not a must! the things they show there are a bit out dated but it was nice to see but for people in the mid 20s I would not recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann-KatrinS
40,Worth doing!,"Even though there is much floor space dedicated to 'old Hollywood', there is still lots and lots to see here. My personal favorites were the ruby red slippers from The Wizard of Oz and the lamp from I Dream of Jeannie (you can see them up close!). A huge Marilyn Monroe exhibit was on today when I visited - a whole floor. There is a dungeon part with scarier things from horror movies and the like. It was actually kinda creepy down there and I wished I had company otherwise I would have felt more comfortable and could be there longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vingummi
50,Very Interesting!,"This is a great museum to check out on your visit to Hollywood. The costumes, the make up worn by the stars of old Hollywood. The floor dedicated to Marilyn Monroe, if you are big fan, check it out. Definitely worth a visit, especially if you like old Hollywood and the glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliBla
40,Marilyn and Joan Crawford Fans Will Like,"We hit this museum after a visit to Mel's Drive-In next door using Mel's discount. The staff at this museum is really enthusiastic and helpful. I pretty much never think about how a place is curated but here I did. It seems as if the museum was built on Max Factor's studio and what remained from this operation moved into the museum. If you love Marilyn Monroe, Joan Crawford or Bette Davis it's fun to see their actual makeup and a bunch of other Max Factor curios.The rest of the place is a bit harder to understand. There are walls full of signatures and photos. There are props from both big and little movies. My favorite was Pee Wee's bike from Pee Wee's Big Adventure. That was worth price of admission for me. Also there is a bit of a thrill in walking in their basement and down a hallway to see Hannibal Lecter's props in a cell that looks like the movie.This place was fun but it's not a must see. It really depends on your appetite for random things and your attachment to old Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarliSP
50,Definitely worth a look!!,"My hotel recommended this museum and was so pleased I took their advice!! Full of interesting bits and pieces from past stars! clothes, jewellery, posters, costumes. Just off Hollywood Blvd and close too other touristy things. Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe sections great and all the old photos and autographs.Best thing I saw was the Silence of the lambs set. very cool to walk through it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enjoyedUSA
50,So much to see,Im a huge Lucille Ball fan and they have one room with alot of her stuff. I was in Heaven in that room. I really enjoyed the whole museum but that room was my all time favorite!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716lynnb
30,Interesting but . . .,"They have a terrific number of items unbelievable trivia to excellent pieces but seemed disorganised, lots of things we thought not of great interest to us. Looked very tired and of need of updating, but some very interesting, probably worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FIZZYS
50,So much to see!,"This is one of the best museums I have visited. The place is just huge and is packed for of historical items. You can see rooms dedicated to actresses like Marilyn Monroe to seeing Elvis' bath robe. Check out the outfits worn by Michael Jackson before going to see the star wars costumes. There is something here for anyone that has seen something made in Hollywood, two thumbs up!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86MarkB86
40,A vision of Hollywood glamour!,"This museum is excellent with lots of items and artifacts belonging to stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor, etc. We spent a good couple of hours looking around. The highlight of this Museum is the black and white photos of Hollywood and its stars from the 1930's onwards. Really interesting place - well worth a visit if you like history and glamourous Hollywood stars of the past",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMrsHill
30,A bit disppointed,"When we were in LA 2 years ago we missed seeing this as it was closed the day we visited. So it was on our 'must see' list this time, and we planned our LA stay around their opening times. Unfortunately, when we did get there we were a bit disappointed. There are great exhibits on the top floor (Michael Jackson, Moulin Rouge, Sonny & Cher), but the lower floors are dedicated to walls of photos and a large exhibit focussing on Loretta Young. It would be good for someone interested in the history of film make up as it has a strong focus on this.Ok for $15 but not what we were hoping for (a broader history of Hollywood)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellykate
40,Definitely worth a visit,"Housed in the old Maxfactor building and full of some great memorabilia. Two make up rooms still exist, one of which was used by Marilyn Monroe herself. The museum is also home to one of the 2 remaining pairs of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the Wizard of Oz (when I was there at least!)Other than that there is history of the Oscars and Hollywood walk of fame as well as costumes and a Chevrolet used by Marilyn Monroe. The history of the building itself is impressive and with it being good value to get in don't miss it out if you are in the Hollywood area. I discovered it late in the day and could have spent much longer exploring it than I had time for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieL357
30,Art Deco Bldg,"Bldg Nostalgia fix!The museum is housed in the original Max Factor building, awesome Art Deco architecture. To me this probably was the most interesting part of the museum.Two Make-up Rooms still exist one where Lucille Ball became a gorgeous redhead & the other where Marilyn Monroe found blondes have more fun. They have original furnishings and of course LOTS of Max Factor makeup and stories.Loretta Young was the special display which I enjoyed. However, amidst her display was a bike and outfit of Pee Wee Herman - WOW - who allowed that disgusting display next to a lady of her grace and glamour???I would not begin to suggest this as must see Hollywood - somewhat stuffy and did not appear quite professionally planned or maintained. However, if old movies and movie stars are your passion - you may find the $15 ticket price well spent. There is an online offer BOGO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nurse024
50,What a place!,"It is one of the best and most atmospheric museums we have ever visited, situated in the old Max Factor building. You can see the room where Marilyn Monroe became a platinum blonde and spend ages looking at film star memorabilia. We spent about 3 hours in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The2Olds
20,Disappointed,"We chose this option under out ""City Pass"" over the Dolby Theatre tour and regretted it. The hostess at the desk was rude and the museum was very musty (not good for someone with allergies). The collection was not as expected, more pictures than actual exhibits. They have a ""freight elevator"" and when asked about using it, the hostess responded ""it's very hard to operate but I can find someone to operate it for if you really want"" in a negative tone. Therefore, we took the stairs. I would not visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyA29
40,Please Dust Marilyn's Car!,"This place is a bit on the funky/quirky side but I have to admit I enjoyed it. It's crammed full of props, costumes, photos, and STUFF. A real classic movie buff would be fascinated. They need to clean it up a bit, though. I would suggest a bit more interactive displays with short film clips or docents to tell the stories about the displays. I enjoyed learning about Max Factor's critical role in the movie business. The museum fits into the whole Hollywood Blvd ambiance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kinwa
40,a must-see while in Hollywood,"I liked all the stuff displayed, there were both current and classic hollywood movie and tv apparell, accessories, etc. I thought it might be lame, but it was actually very interesting and cool to see from christopher reeve's superman outfit to betty davis' shoes and purse to scary character costumes in the basement (it was like a haunted house setting), everything was well worth it, and the lady at the front desk was super nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEXICANRICHBOY
40,Worth the visit!,This was a very interesting museum. Learning about Max Factor was neat. It was amazing how he invented and affected society. I would certainly take time to watch the movie in the small theater. 15-20 minutes but well done.The upstairs had some amazing history and memorabilia. Spend about 1-2 hours for the whole visit. Use the Go card and get free admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenHMD95
30,"Only if you are ""movie"" person","Well I have to say that I was not impressed, the place is a bit obsolete and has mostly stuff from the ""good old days.."" not much from more recent times.It mostly display memorabilia owned or used by the movie stars,If you like to see a dress used by Marilyn or Pamela Anderson then you may like it, otherwise nothing really to see.I would not go again or reccomend it.For my kid (5 and 10) extremely boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickyv_12
50,"Hollywood Museum, Hollywood, CA","This museum has an outstanding collection of movie star memorabilia from the 30's to present time - there are four floors full of extremely interesting displays featuring movies and the great stars from the ""golden age of movies"" - This museum definitely has the best collection of movie memorabilia for movie buffs like myself - it is housed in the original Max Factor Building where the stars used to go for make up -- some of the original star private rooms are still intact and contain original possessions that were there when the stars used the Max Factor building - this museum is definitely worth the trip to see all the displays, and people need to plan enough time to enjoy all four floors of memorabilia. I highly recommend taking a trip down memory lane for the greatest movies in history and seeing this museum. It is the one museum you don't want to miss if you love Hollywood history and the great movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattiprismin
40,A step back in time,"Lots of great old memorabilia from Marilyn Monroe, Loretta Young, and Lucille Ball. When I was there, they had an exhibit of photos showing many of the stars when they received their Star on Hollywood Blvd. Very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandyjpa
40,great,lots to see here. great piece of history. lots of fun and great for the family. will go again when visiting relatives want something different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
10,thank god i didn't pay,"again this was part of my go cardthe museum is based on really old hollywood movies, which isn't my type of thingbuilding looks very oldthe only interesting thing was the hannibal cellwe was in and out in 30 minutes!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babyangel2007
30,OK but rather run-down and no focus.,"This used to be the Max Factor building and museum, but the exhibits now inside seem to ramble. Lot of hommage to Marilyn and a chamber of horrors (for some reason).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler1063_12
30,Interesting,"It was okay and filled some time. The best part was the basement with all the horror films including Silence of the Lambs. But I think, as an Australian, there were some actors we had not heard so it wasn't as interesting. I did love the Marilyn Monroe parts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lgberriman
50,Love it!,I have been twice and plan to visit again when in LA. I am a make-up artist and worked in film so it holds great interest to me and I can spend hours in here. There really isn't much in the Hollywood area so if you do go to Hollywood to see the Walk of Fame then drop in a have a look it's worth a visit even for half an hour or so. I have never lined up to get in so can do it quick if you what and pick what interests you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/April402
30,Pleasant Old Museum,"The museum is just off the ""strip"". It consists of mostly old exhibits. Most of them look old, with much of the luster long gone. Still there is much to see and it made for a pleasant 1/2 visit. It was part of our ""Hollywood Pass"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlelonek
30,Great if You're A Lover Of The Old Film Stars,"We happened upon this museum while reading a guidebook and thought it sounded fun. It is centrally located right across from Hollywood & Vine. The woman who took our tickets was so very nice and helpful. A great start.Fortunately for us, we're over 50 and remember all the stars prominently featured...Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, Bob Hope, Loretta Young, etc. Very few current stars features promnently. However, the museum is set up really nice. The first floor is dominated by Max Factor and his affiliation with Hollywood. Interesting. It also includes a small area of Sci-Fi memorabilia from Star Trek movies and Planet Of The Apes. The second floor had a special exhibit of Loretta Young. While I had heard of her, I wasn't interested although it was nicely done. The third floor is a composite of old and new. They have Jean Harlow, Rudolpho Valentino, Phyllis Diller, The Rat Pack, Sonny & Cher, etc. alongside Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Harry Potter, MIB3, and Dynasty. The exhibits of what I would call current starts (1980's and on) is extremely limited while Jean Harlow had a huge area. They also have the dungeon where you can see the cell from Silence Of The Lambs.All in all, this was a fun outing but again I must stress, if you don't remember old Hollywood you will be greatly disappointed. You also don't need more than 1-2 hours to visit. Then it's a short stroll to Graumann's Chinese Theatre and The Dolby Theatre (formerly The Kodak Theatre) and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.If you're driving, we found a very convenient parking lot off Hawthorn about 1 block back from Highland. Only $10 for all day parking and it has an attendant all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaLBackToNaples
50,Great museum for lovers of Hollywood,Something for everyone. 1000's of props and costumes from mostly movies. A collection that one must see to believe. (They even have the entire prison from Silence of the Lambs).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215JamesF
20,A lot of Max Factor history.....,"Go once....that will be enough. You have to really want to see old Hollywood make-up history. Yeah, there is other stuff too....just didn't interest me very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyseslar
30,A lot of old stuff in a building,"My title pretty much says how I felt walking through the Hollywood Museum - the Max Factor rooms on the ground level didn't interest me at all, and as we moved through the museum there really didn't seem to be any sort of order to the exhibits, memorabilia was just placed where it would fit. I must admit, I'm not a fan of ""old"" hollywood, so the museum may appeal to some people more than others, but I just felt that it was messy and the museum was just accepting anything that the studios themselves didn't want to keep.The thing that did spark my interest was the ""horror/thriller"" section in the basement, but even then most of the artefacts were from the 80's.In total we spent less than an hour in here, but we had admission included with our LA GO card so money wasn't completely wasted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cutieb00tie
40,Hollywood memorabilia on 3 floors,"I did not expect 3 floors of Hollywood History, on the ground floor the Blonde room, Redhead room etc famous celebrities with the hair colors. Marilyn Monroe's death cert and the vial that was found by her bedside. The cellar is horror movie memorabilia, I expected Michael Meyers to come to life and chase me!!! Great life size model of Elvira! Wow what else.... Pamela Anderson's Baywatch bathing suit (complete with a padded bra underneath for life size effect)All the photo's of Stars getting their star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Facinating to me was Max Factor himself, wow so many things he invented and perfected all us ladies should be greatful. I will not divulge here just go into the small theater and watch the bio. My favorite part is the clothing, gowns costumes etc, the perspective I had of the Stars and their actual sizes, amazed me. I mean who knew Sonny and Cher could were the same clothes!!! I live in LA and my visiting In-Laws wanted to come here, I am glad they did it was well worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chewtoy33
50,Great movie memorabilia,"Loved this museum, I wasn't expecting much and spent hours looking at all the memorabilia. This is the orginal Max Factor building and on the ground floor are the make up rooms with his history and the original make up plus stories of Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and other movie starlets. Over 3 other floors you'll find all kinds of movie memorabilia for everyone from classic black and white movies to recent blockbusters and horror movies. Old cameras, scripts, letters, costumes and even cars. I found it really enjoyable to wander through and find my favourite movies and stars. They change the exhibitions frequently as well so I think I will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shell_80
50,Loved It!,"I have lived in the L.A. area 50 years and so glad I found this jewel. Our first time here and we spent about 3 hours here loving every minute of it. All of Hollywood's glitz & glamour from years gone by. How Max Factor created make up for the star's. Marilyn Monroe exhibit, Sonny & Cher, Lucille Ball to name a few and all the silent movies actors. Check out the basement for the horror and sci-fi section, Hitchcock and Hannibal Lectors jail cell. About every 3-4 months or so they change the 2nd floor exhibit. Right now it's Loretta Young, Such a fun afternoon, we will be returning soon. Mel's 50's burger restaurant is next door and the surrounding blocks have the Chinese Theater and a mall across the street and the wax museum, Ripley's Believe It or Not next door. Go early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shellmesa
40,Worth a visit,"If you loved Silence of the Lambs, you must visit. Within the museum is the original jail cell of Hannibal Lecter! Incredible experience. You will also see stacks of other memorabilia and where Max Factor began!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiveMagic_13
40,A Ton of History Here,"You could spend an entire day here looking at all of the stuff and reading all of the stories, etc. We did a fairly quick walk through and took some pictures of the things that we thought were cool and that was fine for us. It was neat to see actual costumes and props from the movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunLovingGurl
50,Interesting!,It's part of California History and is a must see for those who love Hollywood and all things in entertainment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahB627
10,"Glad I didnt have to hand over money for that ""experience""","Luckily our admission was included in our city pass tickets through our travel agent.The museum does contain a mammoth amount of Monroe memories, but purely for true fans. On the entrance level you will find several rooms that were pure walk throughs. They also had a mini cinema soon that seemed to have not seen light nor fresh air since the building was constructed. I felt sorry for the nice family that was entering as we left, as the were handing over their dollars for the admission. I think the museum needs a bit of modernisation to keep up with the rest of LA attractions, but until then dont waste your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwazimodo
50,A must for film fans,"This museum has memorabilia and costumes from practically every iconic film I can think of, so a must for film fans. Also some tv, but being British I hadn't heard of most of the shows. I particularly enjoyed the silence of the lambs set, Casablanca memorabilia and seeing Darth Vader and C3PO. For a lot of the props and costumes there is a screen showing clips from the film they were used in, which I liked. A lot of it is about classic cinema, particularly Marilyn Munroe, and there is a lot of info on the history of make up that might appeal more to girls, but I think there is enough memorabilia to appeal to everyone. It's not very interactive and as most of it is classic cinema I don't know how popular it would be with children. I definitely wouldn't take children downstairs to the horror section, it is dark with scary music playing and even I as a grown woman was a little spooked but I was the only one there so maybe that was why! I was there for about an hour and a half, so not loads of time, but at $15 I think it is worth it. Some of the reviews say you can't take photos- you can, just not with flash. But overall, if you are a fan of film, there is a lot that is of interest, and I definitely think it is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityGirlAimee
50,A Hidden Surprise,This old building hides a lot of interesting facts and memorabilia. It was the old max factor building and the make up secrets was good but the movie/tv stuff they have on the top floor and the dungeon of horrors was great. Very friendly and informative staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAlleycatz
50,EXCELLENT!,We found this place to be very interesting!They've got everything from makeup kits movie stars from the 40's used to clothing worn by Jane Russel & Elvis.Plus they have videos of the stars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnp366
40,Very Interesting,I really enjoyed seeing & learning about the actors & actresses. 4 stories of stuff to see & over 100 years of films.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frosteez
40,Fun Hollywood experience.,"The Hollywood History Museum is a must for film and TV fans. Interesting exhibits and photography of the industry, its stars, and background people. Housed in the old Max Factor Studio, and conveniently located near the corner of Hollywood and Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassidyBayou
40,Fascinating memorabilia and photos of old and recent Hollywood stars and movies in a great original Art Deco building,"What a lovely little museum , costumes, history of stars and movies all original artifacts. Wonderfully photos of old Hollywood. Spread over 5 floors with lifts. Ground floor has preserved its original use of rooms and equipment where stars in 30's and 40's would have gone to get hair and makeup styling. Very good value for money.Tip - we bought a GO Los Angeles card which includes admission to this museum.Fantastic original 50's Mel's diner adjoining building next door with an admission discount to museum for diners customers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKMANX
40,Interesting collection of Hollywood Memorabilia,"This museum is worth a visit with a discount coupon if you are in the area. The collection on the first floor of pictures and autographs of old stars is pretty wild. The museum is housed in the old Max Factor factor and it features a documentary about how he (Max Factor) created the entire make-up industry, not just for film.The Silence of the Lambs exhibit is interesting if you are a fan.Again the collection is eclectic, but it is a bit of a respite from the huge crowds on the Hollywood Walf of Fame and the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pweiss
50,Old Hollywood,"So many things are in this museum, a full display of Marilyn Monroe, but also so many other personal effects and costumes of the old hollywood crowd, plus a bunch of Max factor personal effects, old cameras, editing machines. In Oct, they had a special horror section in the basement where they had the entire prison set of ""Silence of the Lambs"" you can walk down the exact hallway and see the plexiglass holder where Hannibal was held. Pretty creepy, but cool too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13kathyd
30,Good if you like Marilyn,"Certainly lots of stuff in here, but a lot of it is for Marlyin Munroe. If you like her then go but if you're not particularly bothered there may not be enough to justify a visit as her stuff takes up more than a floor.Having said that there was some interesting stuff from Superman, Rocky etc but it won't take long to visit. Went round in under an hour because it was about to close but doubt we'd have taken much longer if we'd gone first thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMTID
40,Good way to spend an hour,"We visited here with a spare hour on a Sunday in October. It was quite quiet so just made for a better experience. The place is jammed with memorabilia which makes it look like a cool overcrowded warehouse. There is information about the various objects and items, and exhibits on certain celebrities. We really enjoyed the basement which was all about horror films, and even had the set of the silence of the lambs which looked really good. They had some big stars costumes etc. and evens cars from shows. The building is the old max factor studios and still has the original makeup rooms and toilets which are really cool. I am a big fan of Marilyn Monroe and they have quite a bit of memorabilla, and photos etc. of her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHRnLAURlikeTOxplr
50,AMAZING,This was probably one of my favourite things of my holiday in America. There was a Marilyn Monroe exhibit as it was 50 years since her death. There was clothes that she wore and photos of her. It was awesome. I loved this as I'm a massive Marilyn fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraR464
50,"Must see, takes a little time.","My husband and I really enjoyed the Hollywood Museum. It doesn't look like much when you first walk in, but does not disappoint. I really enjoyed the Marilyn Monroe exhibit, as did my husband. They even have one of her cars parked in their garage bay. Very cool. Lots of interesting stuff to look at, but make sure to take the time to look at all the cases. Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies, and I almost walked right by the exhibit with some of the props and costumes from the movie. Lots of history about the building itself, being that it's the Max Factor building. It was really cool to see the jail set from Silence of the Lambs, and I'm not a big fan of scary movies. We will definitely visit again.Note: This would not be a good place for wheelchairs or strollers. You do have to go up and down stairs to get to different parts of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slogrande
50,Authentic Hollywood history of TV and Movies!,I felt like a celebrity when I entered the lobby of The Hollywood Museum! It is the original Max Factor Building and the lobby is filled with glamour! There is the room where Lucy became a red head and Marilyn Monroe became a blonde. The dungeon has the original Silence of The Lambs set with Hannibal Lechter's mask. The second floor has original Marilyn Monroe exhibit including her nude photos which Hugh Hefner used in a first pinup. The famous Hollywood Walk of Fame exhibit is also on exhibit. Amazing treasures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheriW918
40,Needs time to look at each description,You will be surprise what you find in this little museum. just take time to look closely at each item.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allansavory
40,Museum for movie lovers and film history,"A hidden secret in LA the Hollywood Museum. Possible the biggest Marilyn Monroe exhibition. Entrance fee USD 15. The museum is located in the old Max Factor building. Lots and lots of information, movie artifacts from 1920 - 2012. All you ever wanted to know about Marilyn Monroe and other stars, see the Hanibal Lecter cell from The Silence of the Lambs, artifacts from Jurassic Park, Elvis, Master and Commander, Lost Ark, Battlestar Galactica and more and more....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RunarP
50,What a find,"Does not look much from the outside, but what a gem, concentrating more on the golden age but other up to date artifacts from film. Max Factor story amazing. A bit scary seeing the Silence of the Lambs jail set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scttgraham
50,Old Fashioned and Wonderful!,Tucked away around the corner from all the hub-bub is this quaint wonderful museum. Nothing at all like Madame Tussaud's or Ripleys or Guiness... this is true hollywood memorabilia... Lots to see here at the old Max Factor building! Great museum!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vakayplannerPa
50,Great attraction,"This is a great attraction, and very reasonably priced too. Only went there for the Marilyn Monroe collection and it was fab. You can see clothes, photos, make-up, everything. It has lots more to see as well. It was great to walk round the Max Factory building knowing its history and the many celebs that have walked there too. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariont499
50,Love the Marilyn Monroe exhibit,"Lots of personal clothing, movie clothing and items from the sets of popular films. I totally enjoyed the Marilyn Monroe exhibit! I'm a big fan and loved pouring over this very detailed exhibit. I would have spent longer than the 1.5 hours I did spend, but my husband is not as big a fan and I am. I really enjoyed my visit to this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherL222
50,Max Factor and Hollywood go hand in hand!,"As we paid the admission fee, mentioned to daughter that this building was once owned by Max Factor and she said, ""Who's that?"" Once the standard in Hollywood, the cosmetics are now marketed overseas and online. Makes you wonder what Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe or Lucille Ball would say today.If you leisurely stroll the three floors filled with movie history, photos, costumes, props, cameras and make-up, need to allow more than one hour to see it all! Although Marilyn and Jean fill a good portion of the exhibit, there are a number of areas that may interest the younger set.....mainly teens and up.A place to visit at least once for the nostalgia, and maybe a second time with a friend or family member who remembers the Golden Age of Hollywood....they'd love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog
50,Very interesting,Really liked this Museum. The Marilyn Monroe exhibition is great. Out favourite part though is the set from Silence of the lambs/Hanibal. Really gave us an idea of how real something can be made to look evn though it's completely fake. Loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/186299Richard
30,Okay if you get entry fee at the right price...,"Some amazing bits and pieces in here but the museum is a bit of a dusty relic and most of it was lost on our three kids who had no idea who many of the people referred to in the exhibits were.The Marilyn Monroe floor gave an insight into her tragic life and showed just what an icon she was (and still is) and the basement with the Silence of the Lambs set was well worth seeing. Could do with rather more interaction though! Plan for about an hour and a half, easy and well priced parking opposite in the Hollywood and Highland shopping centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkM607
20,Interesting.,We went there expecting to be a short visit. We spent almost 2 hours there. $15.00 for an adult and kids are free...except for the $5.00 charge per stroller (never have I been somewhere that they charge you for a stroller..I asked about charging for a wheelchair and she said the same fee applies). Maybe that should be written down somewhere not just a fee that they mention when you walk in. Lady when you check in was very rude and didn't know how to make change. My husband and I have said it wasn't worth our $40.00 and wish we wouldn't have gone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsn74
50,A True Gem,"I have been to Hollywood three times and never went to this museum. We hit all of the main attraction, but I never noticed this one. It blends in with all of the other buildings so, you don't really notice it. It is in the old Max Factor building. The hours are regular buisness hours. You need to plan for your visit or you might miss visiting it. The fee is only $15.00. In Hollywood that is a steal.As everyone else experienced, there was and older lady that took our money. She seemed pleasent enough. When you walk in, you are surrounded by art deco everywhere. The building alone is enough to keep your attention. They have a Marilyn Malone Floor including her white dress and several memorable items. They have a little of everything. It showcases much of old Hollywood, but it includes new Hollywood too. There was enough to keep my 14 year old Niece busy along with plenty for me to see. They had such a variety of momorabilia including Star Wars, High School Musical, Gone With the Wind, Superman, I Love Lucy and much more.My Niece loved the horror room. She got to sit in Jodi Foster's chair from Silence of the Lambs. I wonderful gentleman who use to design costumes, told my niece fun facts about the movie and making costumes.After being a little disappointed with Hollywood in general, going to this place brings the feel of old Hollywood to the present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAF72
30,Not bad time killer,"Great for movie buffs, especially Marilyn Monroe fans.Things inside include Superman costume, Elvis' dressing gown and Spartacus costumes.Lots of small props from movies.A great thing to do to kill some time in the city and one that i would advise going to.Part of the citypass that you can purchase for $59",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiamB193
40,Marilyn Monroe heaven,"This museum was great. It has a huge Monroe exhibition which includes her fridge! Only costs $15 entry. Expect to spend a few hours there, there is so many interesting items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ery559
40,Packed full of interesting memorabilia,"I was really looking forward to this visit as I had read about it online. However our first impressions nearly made us walk out. Someone else mentioned the slightly dotty old lady on reception. We found her to be rude and rather offensive, unable to give change and very confused about how many make 6. We also had to pay $5 for a stroller to go up in the lift !!Having said that, the place was just fascinating for me as well as my kids who are all in their 20s. The Jean Harlow exhibition was brilliant as well as the Marilyn floor. The old Max Factor rooms were very interesting and I loved the collection of old photos of the Hollywood stars on the ground floor. We had a private tour of the basement from a lovely guy who used to work in the movies. He was so friendly and pleasant it made up for the very unfriendly and rather nasty welcome. I am not being ageist, but this woman should not be allowed to interact with the public with her attitude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seapoint40
50,A Hidden Gem,"We were very impressed! They have memorabilia that fills 4 floors. The basement is dedicated to horror films (Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, Halloween, etc.), the first level contains the old Max Factor make-up and hair studios with many old Hollywood photos, the second floor has an amazing collection of Marilyn Monroe treasures and the top floor has Michael Jackson items and Elvis' bathrobe, among other things! It is fascinating and plan on spending a couple of hours, at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truffles06
30,Worth a quick visit,"We visited here whilst in USA for two weeks travelling from LA, to Plam Springs and Las Vegas. I was travelling with my partner and two children, aged 13 and 5.www.hollywoodmuseum.com$15 for adults $12 for kidsThere is parking nearby – easily!!Just off Hollwood Boulevard and really near Graumans theatre and Hollywood/Vine shopping mall.Slightly old musty smelling museum but with amazing collections of costumes and bits and pieces from films of all ages. There is definitely bits here for all age groups and those with good memories! Lots of lovely things to look at. No set route around the museum, just wander as you please. Slightly dotty old lady on reception who was wonderful and full of information.We particularly enjoyed the Silence of the lambs set and Marilyn Monroe exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1980mp1980
50,Very Cool Little Museum,"We visited this little museum recently and found it to be informative, entertaining, and well laid out. There are exhibits from several decades and genres, and the price is not bad considering what you would pay to go to some of the attractions just down the street. I was not impressed with the individual taking payments at the front desk. A sign clearly stated payment by credit card or cash. When I tried to hand her a credit card, she rudely ask if I didnt have cash to which I responded by showing her the sign. She continued to be rude and adamant about a cash payment, so in the interest of time for myself and those behind me, I was able to dig up enough to pay for the admissions. I realize this was just one rude and miserable individual who was apparently intent on making those around her just as miserable, and that she is not an indicator of the rest of the staff, but non the less, it took a little away from an otherwise great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomD588
50,best part of Hollywood!,"Let me preface this by saying that it was my first (and LAST ) trip to Hollywood, and I was pretty much disgusted about everything - EXCEPT this cute, informative museum! Hollywood is most definitely NOT what you see on TV! It's filthy, crowded with rude people and shop owners, and full of nothing but tacky souvenir shops. BUT, there is this amazing place where you can spend hours looking at old movie memorabilia. The building is what used to be the Max Factor studio for all the movie stars. Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball had their hair dyed here. You can see an entire floor of Marilyn items. Really makes you see the tragedy of her life, I think. There's also an entire set from Silence of the Lambs. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.If you MUST go to Hollywood - don't miss this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emtcincinnati
50,Absolutely loved it!,"This was an awesome museum. We were 7 people in the age range of 8 to 62, and everyone loved it. There was contemporary (High School Musical, Soprano's, etc) and historic exhibitions (Marilyn Monroe, Jean Harlow, etc), and the small movie theater showing the history of make-up was fascinating - even to the gentlemen in the group ;-) Would definitely come here again! Plenty of clean bathroom facilities, and very friendly staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millerjace
50,Fun,I like the Hollywood Museum it's something to do and see alot of things kids always enjoy this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Des407
50,I loved this place!!,"This is a great place if you want to see old Hollywood. There was a tribute to Marilyn Monroe and i actually had an opportunity to leanr more about and other old school celebs.We went as a part of our city pass and it was well worth it. This museum was perfect for my kids, ages 12 and 10-they emjoyed it, very educational and informational. Might be a little boring for younger kids, however my 10 year old loved becasue she loves history!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonifromOhio
30,Let Down.,"The hours are limited but from what I had read I had to make the trip here but it was a let down. Its definitely for the older movie lover. Marilyn Monroe stuff stretched out on an entire floor would be nice but a lot of items were phone bill, checks, valet receipts that she owned...wow. the only redeeming part was the basement with the silence of the lambs setup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themovieguy
50,So much fun!,This place was great! the entry fee is very cheap and you stay busy for hours. Theres tons of movie memorabilia like clothes the actors wore in certain movies and even Marilyn Monroe's car. I definitely recommend visiting the Hollywood Museum to complete you Hollyweird experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/03nismochick
40,Interesting to visit with alot of memorabilia. Way better than other tourist traps in Hollywood.,There are some interesting items including PeeWee's bike from his movies. Yes it is not in the Alamo basement.Some items are average but there are some gems if you keep looking.they even have Roddy McDowells bathroom which is a crackup.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shipdad
30,A Museum for the older movie buff,"We decided to visit the museum as part of our Hollywood CityPass. It is located in a narrow, easily overlooked two story building on Highland, just off Hollywood Blvd. It has an old Hollywood feel from the moment you step in the door. You aren't allowed to take pictures. They have a whole area upstairs dedicated to Marilyn Monroe. A lot of old movie memorabilia throughout the place. The upper floors would appeal more to the older generations, late fifties and up. The lower floor does have some horror movie stuff but not much current. Young kids could get bored here. I would not have bought this ticket by itself. It was just okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigsOpinion
40,A very interesting place,We had an interesting afternoon exploring this museum. The Marilyn Monroe exhibition they had on was particularly good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandash67
50,Loved it!,"This museum was not in our plan until I found it on the internet an hour before we arrived. I wanted something else to do in Hollywood. The explaination says what is there but it really doesn't do it justice. It was nice that something is way more than is advertised. Well worth the price of admission.I was interested in the Max Factor history but it is so much more. There are four floors packed with stuff. I could have easily spent three or four hours looking at all of the exhibits. There is old time stuff and new time stuff. There is hardware such as old editing machines and new stuff.There was a lot of Marilyn on exhibit, if you have a fan in your family this is a must see. Oh and they have a pair of ruby slippers. Fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journey809300
40,lots of well preserved exhibits,"The front of the museum was not facing the hollywood boulevard, but nonetheless quite easy to spot with the marilyn monroe statute placed right at its door..Staff were friendly, lots of well preserved exhibits.. Managed to finish viewing all the exhibits in less than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluvhunni
50,Wonderful history!,"Wow, wow, wow! What a wonderful place! A must see! There is so much history and they have done a great job displaying the artifacts. Even my teenage son was impressed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizzyborden21
40,Pure Hollywood,Enjoyed this - great museum full of glamour. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneC742
40,A nice walk into the past of Hollywood,Iconic Marylin dresses and memorabilia from the golden age of Hollywood. Also if you are a fan you can enter Hannibal Lecter's cell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcie_x76
50,Nostalgic plus latest movie fun!,"I spotted this as I was walking around Hollywood Boulevard (its just round the corner) only $15 admission price and lots to see especially if you like old style stuff. Monroe, Crawford and Bette Davis clothing and shoes and make-up plus interesting documents and photos of Jean Harlow.There are several floors and it goes right to the back. Also latest stuff like wardrobe from Series The Walking Dead and James Franco's clothes from 127 hours!The spooky cells where Silence Of The Lambs was filmed was creepy! I loved it.The Lady at front desk was very helpful :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorraineW18
50,Wow! What a collection.,"Always in love with cinema, we decided to check out this attraction b'cuz of the building ties to Max Factor. We couldn't have been happier. Loved the building, slight kitsch factor, and about 10,000 props, costumes, etc. Lots of museums down in this stretch, but this place is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephM657
50,Max Factor Building-Awesome!,The first floor has the most interesting items. Learn about Max Factor and all he did for women's cosmetics. Lots of great photos and history. Take a ride in the huge elevator that is big enough to haul cars up and down the floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/copejenney
50,Well Worth the Visit,"We went to the Hollywood Museum (the one on Highland, there are several) because it had Indiana Jones and Jaws paraphernelia and we had a 10 year old with us.We loved it....it is located in the historic Max Factor Building which is a lovely piece of architecture. The first floor is very old Hollywood - lots of pictures and history from the Lucille Ball/Marlene Dietrich/Glamour Era - it was wonderful to see the old Max Factor ads and big names in them as well as pictures of the ""old Hollywood"" glamour stars.There are three levels - they have memorabilia from movies, the largest Marilyn Monroe collection, and several rotating exhibits from more modern movies that are on loan to them from the studios.I loved it and would go back again without my son (he gets a little rammy) to take my time....Grab a 10% off coupon and eat next door at Mel's Drive-In. Good food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
30,Meh - Kinda boring if you don't like old school movies.,"Well the lonely planet lists this museum as a ""must see"" - but if you are under 35 I'd say forget it. Why do I say this? Well because there really isn't any movie/tv items that directly relate to our age group. The advertisements for this place make you think there is lots of Zac Effron, Leo DiCaprio, and Miley Cyrus clothes and such... and you get in there and there is barely nothing. The one cool thing is the replica of the Silence of the Lambs cell.. and that's about it. My friend and I breezed through here in about 20 mins. I swear the women's bathroom upstairs might be haunted ! Super scary. If you love Max Factor (the makeup artist) and old-school movies (Judy Garland-era) this place is for you. Otherwise - save your money!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicav85
40,Great TV and movie items,3 floors of film and TV items old and new. This place is amazing they have masses of memoribilia and it takes a good couple of hours to go through it all. You can take pictures throughout which was great. I loved the winner is exhibit and the old max factor rooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbleMackTravel
30,Good for about 60-90 minutes,"We got a groupon so our admission was 2 people for 15 dollars. I wouldn't pay much more. It was cool to see the old Max Factor stuff as well as the limited memoribilia. If you can get cheap tickets, I say go for it! Downstairs was very creepy, especially since the museum was empty on a Saturday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nursemelis374
30,It's okay,"Always wanted to go, but not that impressed. The best item was the Bicycle from Pee Wee. Other than that you will be done in an hour . It's around the corner from Graumans Theatre on Hollywood Blvd",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/istanbulrocks
30,Old Movie Buffs Heaven,There are four floors of movie memorabilia. It was interesting. I was disappointed because the red slippers from The Wizard of Oz were missing the day I was there. They were of great interest to me. Max Factor and the history of his make up was interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krf7674
40,Great Collections of Movie Costumes and Props,They have a huge collection of movie costumes and props. A must visit place if you are a movie fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen_Min
50,Great glympse at Hollywood's past,"Having been to Hollywood dozens of times, I always had this museum on the back burner. Well after having gone, it is easily the best attraction in Hollywood.Upsides:1. It is in the actual Max Factor Studio, so the location itself it a historic building. It was an incredibly building when built and many of those great touches from lights to the bathroom fixtures are well kept.2. As a long-time movie buff, I still learned a lot (albeit a lot about make up, but it was still pretty cool information)3. Beautiful assortment of costumes from the silent era through today.4. An extensive autograph - and photograph - collection5. A wealth of information about Max Factor the man and the company and the influence they had on make-up.6. Incredible assortment of movie posters, however there is nothing labeling what is original and what is a re-print.I would allot at least two hours for seeing everything. It is not a huge museum, but with so many exhibits you can definitely spend several minutes finding all the hidden gems.Downsides:1. If you are not a fan of the golden age of movies, this museum may be short on items to hold your interest.2. The horror stuff in the basement isn't at all scary, but the kids are terrified to head down there because they did a nice job of making the entrance feel spooky3. That ""bronze"" statue of Marilyn out front is hideous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFranci
40,Lots of movie nostalgia for fans of classic movies,"Sited in the historic Max Factor building, the museum's collections span from the Hollywood’s early days to the near present. Although teens and younger children may find costumes, props, and memorabilia dating from the 1980's more interesting, this museum is more oriented toward older film buffs recalling Hollywood's ""golden age."" Women will like the glamor and cosmetics connection that is a central part of several exhibits. It's a great place for an older generation to share their movie experiences with a younger generation. Non-flash photos are permitted.A receipt from Mel's Drive-In, which has a door into the museum, provides discounted museum admission. Mel's Drive-In, a 1950's themed diner, has a story of its own and is worth visiting before and/or after the museum - even apart from the museum discount. The museum staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wind_walker1
40,great,buy tickets onlinegreat fun for familiesgreat fun for everyone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deniz91
30,Hollyweird?,I'm not a movie or movie actor/actress fan! It was Boorrring!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
30,So much stuff,"The staff here were so friendly and outgoing, however there is so much crap stuffed into this building and it appeared to me to be unorganised. They do have a huge collection though. I personally was looking for Transformer stuff as advertised on the brochure but didn't find any, it was there somewhere amongst it all. The exhibition of horror left over from Halloween was good. Worth a look but don't expect too much. If your into really old movies Im sure you will find this very interesting, not alot of modern stuff though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AarondQueensland
50,Nice prop collection,We got into the museum just as it opened and it filled up later on as it was raining heavily outside. This museum is much better than the horridly bad Grammy Museum near downtown (see my TripAdvisor review of that attraction and you will see what I mean). There are many props on display in many small rooms (mostly from older films). Some of the artifacts on display are:* autograph signatures from former stars including Walt Disney* a crashed spacecraft from Planet of the Apes* Christopher Reeve's superman outfit* outfits of Darth Vader and C-3PO from a couple of Star Wars films* Frankenstein outfit* Michael Jackson's black wigs* Indiana Jones' hat and whip* a plane from Jurassic ParkMany of the exhibits are quite small though the ones upstairs are more spread out. But this museum is well conveniently located near the walk of fame and other attractions along there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
40,Loads to see but exhibits a bit crowded,Loved the old Max Factor building. Great exhibits - so much to see you are overwhelmed. It would be great if they had more space. Definitely worth a visit. Most people would find something of interst.Shame it is in such a tacky area! The stars in the pavement are nearby (Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland) but it is all a bit shabby unfortunately.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BindiB
40,Fun place to blow a couple of hours.,Loved all the memorabilia from stars I grew up with a little of the new stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FriendlyFords
50,This is a great take in Hollywood!!,"We happened to be the first visitors in the museum on a Saturday morning and had the museum to ourselves for a short while. The first floor has these wonderful rooms (in the beautiful, Art Deco Max Factor building) with displays of Hollywood leading ladies and their beauty history. Downstairs is the Hollywood Horror exhibit..great for horror movie buffs. We stayed the longest on the fourth floor exhibit which had so many items for Hollywood history you would lose count. If you are a movie buff--this museum is for you. We had a bite to eat at Mel's diner right after our tour, and we noticed that if you eat at Mel's Diner first, you get a discount to the museum. Easy parking is on the right of Mel's. The museum is located just around the corner from Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Kodak Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcellaJ
40,Was fun,Was interesting and although not high on my list of must sees we enjoyed it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/exploringaussie
40,"If you like old movies, mixed with a little new...this is the place for you","I really didn't think I'd be there that long, maybe an hour or so, but I love old movies and enjoyed looking at all the pictures and memorabilia and stayed 3 hours. The only problem with this place is that there is not much information on how they got a lot of the clothes, shoes, cars etc nor much background information. For instance, there is a pair of ruby slippers from the Wizard of Oz, but just a small card saying they were used in the film. Some of the artifacts are so interesting, you just wish you knew more. As well as some of the old stuff from 30's, 40's etc. there is nearly an entire floor dedicated to ""I LOVE LUCY"". There's also a creepy part of the museum, with (surprisingly) some Dexter memorabilia as well as a portion of the set from Silence of the Lambs. Marilyn's car was pretty cool too. The beautiful dress that Angelina Jolie wore to the Mr. & Mrs. Smith premiere was pretty awesome too! I think this museum is definitely worth seeing at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalSorrows
30,Interesting,"Museum was great, but we were charged full price even though there was no access to the second floor because a new exhibit was being created. Pricy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732karenm
40,Fun at the Hollywood Museum,"We visited the museum and it was fun to see genuine sets and costumes from Hollywood. It's a ""must do"" when visiting Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingPam
40,Good reminiscing!,"If this is the Max Factor Museum, it was really good. We got a voucher package from the booth outside the Kodak theatre which included this museum. 3 floors or memorabilia, to wander through. Was really interesting to see Marilyn Monroes car, costumes from movies etc. Would defo recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliBO2011
40,Very good museum,Well worth spending an hour or so looking around this museum.Hannibal Lecters cell was awesome... so realistic it was quite spooky.Lots of costumes and props from films through the ages. Somehting for everyone.Not cheap at $15 each but still worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilR265
50,The soul of old Hollywood lives on in this often undiscovered gem,"I genuinely wish that more visitors discovered this place, just off the beaten path of Hollywood Boulevard or the Chinese Theater forecourt. The location is perfect on Highland, in the one of the best preserved Art Deco facades in all of Hollywood - the old Max Factor building. It is really a shame that so many out-of-towners seeking a taste of movie magic miss it in Hollywood. The human oddities and the more blatantly commercial tourist traps and t-shirt shops often cut them off at the pass and leave them with a bad taste, before they have a chance to get the story of this powerful place in our collective imagination here or even see a movie in the beautifully restored Chinese or El Capitan Theaters around the corner.Despite their meager advertising budget, this is a significant attraction (3 levels, 35,000sf compared to the 5,000 square foot Guinness Museum). Although not as slick/interactive or as huge as the subject matter of film deserves, the collection is amazing and the intimate nature of the authentic old Hollywood building make it feel ""just right.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpcotPlanner
40,interesting,"found this museum quite interesting, enjoyed the old memorbilia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerrieg707
50,Amazing - well worth a visit,"We had to meet a friend of mine nearby so in order to kill time we thought we would visit this museum. Well I think we were in there for almost three hours. It was truly fascinating. I hadn't really heard of this museum before and was really only expecting to spend about 30mins to 40mins, but we were absolutely mesmerised by all the memorabillia.Even if you're not that into old Hollywood actresses there is still heaps of other things to see and keep you amused. The costumes alone fascinated me. And the downstairs haunted area - woah. Don't go in there alone!It's in a fabulous location right near the Highland Centre and Grumman Theatre so if you're in the area I would highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisslisOz
40,Excellent collection in historic building,"I am a local, taking an out of town guest around Hollywood. The collection & display was surprisingly nice. Very interesting. Some of the placards were quite wordy and a bit hard to read through the display case. Very friendly staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OH2CA
50,Overwhelming Amounts of Hollywood Memorabelia,"I imagine some guests can walk through this museum in no time at all, as for me, I have been 3 times and still learn new things and see new props or costumes and every time I go, I plan hours to spend here. Originally Max Factor Studios, where Max himself would make up such celebrities as Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball (just to name a few) in rooms that were specific to their skin and hair colors. Today, those rooms still exist, but the museum itself is full of all sorts of Awesome Hollywood costumes and props and exhibits. LOVE this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/breeanna1967
30,Nice quick stop!,"I had a Go L.A. pass, so I decided to stop in and see the museum. It was a nice quick stop with a lot of artifacts. The second floor was closed, so I didn't get to see it all, but what I did see was fun. If you have the pass, go see it, but if not, you may want to pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnson062610
50,A Must See! hidden hollywood gem,This is one of the best museums in Los Angeles. It is filled with interesting history. My favorite part is the basement where I got to be on the actual set of Silence of the Lambs. Really awesome!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
50,"Movie buffs, allot your time wisely to see all this memorabilia!","I wish we had more than a few hours to spend in this great little museum. It was one of the few places at hollywood and highland that wasn't packed. Our group is fascinated by movie stars (Marilyn, Judy Garland, Lucille Ball, etc.) and so it was definitely worth it for us. Marilyn Monroe's limo is there (plus a whole Marilyn Room!), along with the picture of just about every movie star from the 30's to the 70's, and tons and tons of memorabilia. We even saw one of Judy Garland's pairs of red ruby slippers from Wizard of Oz. It's actually in the old MAX FACTOR building and so it is beautiful to look at from the outside as well as the inside. You can see the rooms where Marilyn became a blonde, Lucy became a redhead, etc. and while we were there it was decorated for Christmas. I felt rushed because we only had 2 hours to spend before closing time, so I'd recommend giving yourself a few hours if you truly want to read and see everything. My husband's favorite part was the scary-movie related stuff downstairs - Hannibal Lecter's cell, etc. He met the gentleman who had designed and created some of the very sets and props we were looking at! I'll go back next time I am in Hollywood - little pricier than expected for a ticket but worth it for movie or movie starr buffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsBingo12
30,Interesting museum,"Less visited that many other attractions in LA, this little museum is worth a visit especially if you have the tourist card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mjnvakantiecoach
50,Oh My Goodness.,"Amazing. I could have spent the entire day there. So much movie history and memorabilia. There are also modern references, but the historical side of it, is incredible. The Lucille Ball exhibit currently showing, is wonderful in itself. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marciamc
30,Sensory Overload,"The museum is housed in a beautfiul old building - the old Estee Lauder building. There is so much information crammed into the displays that it would take you days to fully appreciate it. However because all the information is crammed into a fairly small space, it is a bit overwhelming and therefore doesn't do itself any favours. I was limited in time on the day of my visit, and unfortunately because the displays were so 'dense' with information I felt I couldn't do it justice by taking sufficient time to read and enjoy all the information. There is a large exhibit about Jean Harlow, and a whole floor dedicated to Lucille Ball. Downstairs there is a lot of information about Estee Lauder and hollywood makeup. The basement has dispalys from horror movies, such as Silence of the Lambs. If you do visit, please allow enough time to try and appreciate all the displays available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravels-7
30,"A little cheesy, but somewhat interesting","This might be a good place to go if anyone in your group is super-obsessed with Lucille Ball or Marilyn Monroe, as you get to see their makeup kits and the museum has in-depth displays about them. For us, it wasn't exactly worth the $20 for two of us to tour it for 30-45 minutes, but it wasn't a huge rip-off either. We liked getting to see the costumes from some famous movies (Christopher Reeves' superman suit, for example) but some of the displays seemed a little strange and would only be interesting to a select few people. It kind of seems like the museum gets their hands on everything they can and displays it without much rhyme or reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sara78412
50,Really Enjoyed It,"This chaotic but museum brings together exhibits that demonstrate the brilliant absurditities of Hollywood. It's passionate, crazy, and disorganzed. This is what I came to see. Go there with the expectation that it is a treasure hunt. Particularly excellent if you know your classic films and all the decades between now and then (not for people who've only watched films from the last 10 years).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgefishercanada
50,GO,"Like classic Hollywood? Go here its pretty amazing, and eat at Mel's before hand to get some $ off tickets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaM970
50,A Great Insight,"A lot about ""I Love Lucy"" one of the first sitcoms I remember in contrast a padded cell as in ""Silence of the Lambs"" A lot about Marilyn Monroe, including her car. Plenty of atmosphere.And you can get too it from Mel's Diner",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwenisgreat
50,Surprising,"We didn't expect too much of this since, compared to most other things on Hollywood Boulevard, it's pretty low key. Oh, how wrong we were. There is so much Hollywood history in this place, ranging from a pair of Ruby slippers to a full size reconstruction of the cells in Silence of the Lambs. I cannot recommend this place enough, there's something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crackleviolet
50,Don’t miss experiencing this museum’s interesting and extensive collection of movie items.,"With the thousands of genuine movie related props, costumes, photos, posters, memorabilia and documentaries highlighting exhibits to see, one could easily spend the entire day at this museum. The museum exhibits change frequently, so we are repeat visitors.More recent items displayed are from ""Star Trek"", ""Transformers"", the ""Sopranos"", and ""Twilight"", as well as celebrity dresses and suits worn to current movie openings and award shows.While there are many new movie exhibits displayed, there is a tendency to emphasize the glamorous female stars of the golden age, perhaps due to the Max Factor connection.We enjoyed the temporary Jean Harlow exhibition which included her car, a 1934 convertible Packard and biographical documentary narrated by Sharon Stone. Most museum documentaries are 36 to 45 minutes long, but there are chairs to sit in. There was even a rare wall painting, rescued from Jean Harlow’s original house, depicting her and other famous era actors as medieval royalty.The museum contains some personal, private collections usually not available to the public or other organizations. It was interesting to see how much Marilyn Monroe styled herself after Jean Harlow and the eerie similarities in each of their last unfinished movies.The Lucille Ball exhibit is huge and includes personal touches like her own Ivy designed dishes used in Lucy's home and on her t.v. show. There are touching letters in addition to her movie posters and television series pictures.We are looking forward to seeing the upcoming Holiday Winter Wonderland exhibit starting November 23rd, 2011 to January 23rd, 2012. This display will feature 18 Christmas trees from classic, holiday themed movies, such as “Miracle on 34th Street”, “It’s A Wonderful Life” and newer movies like “Home Alone”.The 50th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death is in 2012 and museum personnel advised us to look on their website for the dates of a large presentation about her.The friendly and informative staff can be found at a table in the front lobby, by the entrance, where vintage post cards of movie stars are for sale. But, I would have liked to have bought post cards of the museum exhibits or at least booklets about the larger and temporary displays, which disappointingly aren’t sold.The best places to take pictures, without a flash, of display items inside the museum are: the beautiful and historic front lobby, the original Max Factor makeup rooms and the vintage photo gallery. However, the ground floor car display, in the back, needs more lighting, as well as Hannibal Lecter’s dark cell in the basement.A good place to park is the nearby Hollywood and Highland complex, which charges a fee of $2.00 for up to four hours, with validation. The maximum fee for parking the entire day is $10.00.The museum personnel will stamp your parking ticket at their lobby table. The Hollywood and Highland information booth staff, by the front sidewalk, also validates parking tickets for free.Not everything is behind glass. Inside the freight elevator a movie usually plays and there is a mini Eiffel Tower from “Moulin Rouge” and the giant foot-bunny-carrot thing from “Along Came Polly”.In the basement, visitors can pose with authentic movie props like the cannons from “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World” and Egyptian props from the silent film “Cleopatra”. You can have your picture taken in the padded asylum room at the end of the “Silence of the Lambs” movie set.All of this for the admission price of $15.00 for adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catnewman
50,Now THIS is the real Hollywood,"We spent hours at the Hollywood Movie Museum in the old Max Factor building, just off Hollywood Boulevarde. We chose to see this rather than highly over-rated 'theme parks' and the glimpse of the outside of a building where sitcoms we have never seen are filmed and thrill rides. In a town that has destroyed most of the things that made it what it was (MGM studios etc) this is the REAL Hollywood. From the original Max Factor make-up rooms through the extensive autograph collection, the actual cell set from silence of the lambs, through to the Lucille Ball exhibit THIS IS IT! I know a lot of young people have no knowledge of anything pre the year 2000 but they need to see this place!. This is the reason Hollywood is Hollywood. Priceless and timeless!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beenthere088

30,interesting,"The museum is located in the old site of Max Factor's beauty salon where one can tour his separate rooms designed for red heads, blondes and ""brownettes."" Although the museum was not well curated, there were interesting displays of Lucille Ball and Jean Harlow that were worth the admission. You come away feeling that for a brief moment, you were part of the glamorous olden days of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herhonor54

50,A place for the true Hollywood film buff!,"Depending on where you're coming from in life you will either love this place or find it to be deadly boring. In either case, iI don' t think it would appeal to children.My sister and I both loved this museum! Seeing the clothing, makeup and personal items of the old time glamour queens was super interesting - BUT we are both in our 60's and grew up watching the films of the great glamour girls who frequented the Max Factor salon. I would think any film buff would enjoy this museum.The makeup/hairstyling rooms designated to ""Blondes"" ""Brunettes"" and ""Redheads"" were fascinating and full of glamour shots of the various stars, many of them featured in advertisements ""back in the day"" for the Max Factor line of cosmetics. Max was quite the marketer and undoubtedly got very wealthy by promising housewives that ""they too could look like a movie star!""The blonde room concentrated on Marilyn Monroe. In addition to showing film clips of Marilyn in action, the black spangly dress she wore onstage during her early 1950's USO tour of Korea is exhibited on a display mannequin. I always love seeing the movie stars' clothing on this type of mannequin because you can see what size they actually were. Marilyn was actually quite small, as were so many of the great stars. I guess it is only on the silver screen where they seem so HUGE!In additon to the makeup/styling aspect of this museum it also houses artifacts and memorabilia from many movies, including one of several pairs of the ruby red slippers Dorothy wore in The Wizard of Oz. During our visit in Sept, 2011 the entire second floor display area was devoted to Lucille Ball and her career. A very thorough and interesting look at her and Desi's pioneering TV work! Did you know that Lucy came to Hollywood as a platinum blonde? Max Factor made her into a redhead....and the rest is history!We spent about 3 hours in the museum on a Tuesday afternoon. It was not overly crowded.Practical matters: Admission price is reasonable at $15 with a Senior Discount bringing it down to $12..Many of the displays involve reading.Parking is readily available in a parking lot located 1/2 block down Highland. You pay the parking fee od $8.00, get your ticket stamped inside the museum, and are given back $5.00 when you leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaofPgh
30,Worth a Visit if your in Hollywood,"For some reason there is no motion picture museum in Southern California (although there are plans for one in the next 6 years by the Academy of Motion Pictures). So until then the Hollywood Museum is the best museum in the area for movie and TV fans.The museum is in the old Max Factor building a block from the Grumann Chinese Theatre.Admission is $15 and I had no problem spending a couple hours checking out the exhibits. There are 4 floors of items and props that range from a whole floor on Lucille Ball to my favorite which was the entire set of the jail cells and hallway used in the Silence of the Lambs.One thing that I would like to see them improve on is that there were several exhibits that did not have anything to tell us about the item. Another thing that suprised me was there is no gift shop. When was the last time you went to museum and there was no gift shop?So, the bottom line is, if you are a movie buff and find yourself in Hollywood this museum is probably worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seeing-America-241
40,"Good, but mainly for Lucille Ball fans","Being from the UK, I didn't realise how big Lucille Ball used to be (in Hollywood), this museum devotes a whole floor to her.The silence of the Lambs cell set is in the basement, so certainly worth visiting just to see that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_LGW
50,This is great.,Loved all the old stuff. I Love Lucy fans don't miss this place. It's in the old Max Factor building which adds to the charm. Has Hollywood walk of fame pictures too.Crammed full of all kind of great stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladcol
50,Fantastic - do not miss this,Me and my daughter would have stayed here all day it is such a fantastic place full of hollywood history. To see the beauty rooms max factor had set up restored is amazing you rely feel you have stepped back on time. Some of the memorabilia on display here is fascinating. I nearly had an attack when I saw the actual ruby slippers! I could go on and on about this place - just go and visit you will not be disappointed. Open wed-fri only.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinTash
40,"Great for lovers of classic films, not for children","Tons of memorabilia stock the glass cases of this museum, which is eye candy for those who love the movies, but especially the classics. Exhibits include Hannibal's cell for Silence of the Lambs, Pee-Wee's bike, and Cary Grant's Rolls Royce to name a few. However, there are a few modern attractions thrown in as well, to keep you interested if you drift into earlier unfamiliar films. This is a great attraction to visit solo, if you happen to be the only one in your party interested in the classics. Since not many kids visit, it is usually quiet, so maximum enjoyment is allowed. Bring your cameras, just no flash photography allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminOdom
50,"This place is amazing, a real treat for fans of the golden age of Hollywood.","I absolutely loved our visit to this museum. It is crammed full of stuff, from fascinating photos of how Hollywood has developed since its earliest years to artifacts such as a couple of Marilyn Monroe's dresses and a pair of her shoes. The Jean Harlow display is fascinating. The building is very atmospheric, it doesn't appear to have been ripped to pieces and re-fitted with modern stuff and this adds to the authenticity of the place. It is crammed full of stuff, there is so much to look at. If you are really interested in the history of Hollywood and it's movie stars then allow yourself plenty of time for your visit so that you can look at and read all the information on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Granville45
50,What a treat!,"Being born and raised in Southern California...we passed by the Max Factor building dozens and dozens of times but never went in...what brought us in on 6/18/11 was their exhibit ""Harlow at 100""...wow...their display was beautiful...they had a 1932 Packard, many costumes and photos attributed to the Blonde Bombshell Jean Harlow. We also enjoyed the vintage make up rooms once used by the Great Max Factor. It was neat to see the vintage cosmetics and personal items owned by Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth (to name a few)....The museum also has a very interesting movie about the life and times of Max Factor himself. The lady that works there Eleanor was a sweetheart and made us feel quite welcomed there......would highly recommend this place for a lover of ""Classic Hollywood""....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraalva
50,Don't miss the Hollywood Museum in LA!!!,"During my short stay in LA, I was looking forward to see the Kodak Theatre and the walk of fame, but what really surprised me was the Hollywood Museum. For the true fans of movies and classic cinema, this museum is the perfect place to go and spend the afternoon (arrive early, they close at 5pm!). Between photographs, clothes, personal belongings of the actors, old cameras and set devices this museum takes you back in time to the glamour of old Hollywood, and to a journey inside the movies. There you can find the ruby shoes from Wizard of Oz, Marilyn Monroe's Cadillac, Indiana Jones' hat and whip, and even Hannibal Lecter's jail cell from Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. AMAZING!!!! I felt like Jodie Foster going trough the aisle to meet Anthony Hopkins!It was beautiful, exciting, emotional... everything!!! I loved, and I think that visiting this museum is as essential as seeing the hollywood sign! DON'T MISS IT!!Heloisa, from Brazil :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helocassanho_11
50,A Hidden Gem in Tinseltown,"Initially, I was very skeptical of the Hollywood Museum since I was concerned that it would be too cheesy and dated. However, this museum that is tucked away in an unassuming building (close to the Kodak Theater) surprisingly exceeded our expectations!The Hollywood Museum was very glamorous, as well as educational. It was amazingly diverse, ranging from old horror movie artifacts to costumes from the movie ""Burlesque"" and the current ""Star Trek.""My favorite highlight was the grand entrance / powder rooms; it makes one feel as if one was going back-in-time during the ""Golden Age of Hollywood."" It was fascinating how there were different rooms based on the starlets' hair color. By contrast, my honey's favorite part was the ""Silence of the Lamb"" prison cell. Lol. We would definitely return back for their new ""Lucy and Desi"" exhibit. Finally, Eleanor was a very friendly and a helpful host. Thank you, Eleanor for making us feel welcome! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitesnowy
40,Very Interesting and informative,"The Hollywood Museum is located in the original Max Factor building, and is just around the corner from the Walk of Fame. It is a very interesting museum with hundreds of props, costumes, and makeup used on many Hollywood films. This museum has a bit more items from older films and television shows, but they do have more recent items as well, for example I saw costumes from Disney's High School Musical 3, Dream Girls, and my favorite: costumes from the Twilight Saga: New Moon movie (I'm a HUGE Twilight Fan). When I visited the Hollywood Museum in August, there was almost an entire floor dedicated to a temporary Marilyn Monroe exhibit, but I believe that particular exhibit has ended since. I also really enjoyed the smaller rooms that were modeled to look like the dressing rooms of classic, popular, Hollywood actresses, like Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe.I would not recommend taking young children to this museum, it is not a hands on activity place, and kids may grow bored. You will be mainly looking at items behind glass and reading plaques that go with items.I was told upon entering the museum you can take pictures but WITHOUT flash.Overall I found this museum to be very interesting and informative, and an excellent edition to my Hollywood vacation experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gina2
50,If you're a big movie fan...,"As the previous reviewer said, if you're a movie fan, and particularly of the Golden Age, you will really enjoy the Hollywood Museum.It's chocked full of memorabilia, costumes and props and the walls are covered in photographs of the stars from an era where the stars were truly cool. I could have spent days just admiring these photos.I can understand why certain people would find this museum a little old-fashioned and tedious - it's a lot of looking in cabinets and reading info cards - but if you love movies, the process of movie-making and movie stars then you will be enthralled.I visited in 2005 and again in May 2010 and whilst there were key exhibits that remained I was impressed by how up-to-date some of the movies represented were.The location is great, especially for rolling an hour's visit into a 'Hollywood' day and if you eat at the Mel's next door (which, quite frankly, why wouldn't you?) you get a few dollar discount on presentation of your receipt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDN_2009
50,Great for movie fans,"I went to the Hollywood Museum last month with my Dad when he was in town. He wanted to see Hollywood. They are located near the stars on Hollywood boulevard, so we made a day out of it, walked around Hollywood & Highland, went to Mel's Diner for lunch and spent the afternoon at the museum. My Dad liked all the old hollywood props, especially the camera's upstairs and the historic photo room. The museum is in the Max Factor building, which is art deco and restored inside. I enjoyed seeing the original hair and makeup rooms, they had Marilyn Monroe's dresses and jewelry in there. We liked the award season exhibit, got to see the costumes from ""Twilight: New Moon"", ""Hurt Locker"", ""Transformers"" and a bunch of other films. I thought it was a good way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reddevilASU
40,Lots of Movie props and it was interesting!,"We visited The Hollywood Museum in late october 2009. This museum is just off Hollywood Boulvard and costs $15 each.You could easily spend around an hour in here looking around.They have props, costumes and lots of stuff from films example rockys boxing gloves, Elvis bathrobe, lost props, Bruce Willis costume from Die hard 2 and plenty more.The most interesting is downstairs in the basement where the Silence of the Lambs cell is.The only disadvantage with this museum is they wont let you take pictures buy i highly recommend a visit if in the Hollywood area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thrahtobe
20,It is was not what we expected,"We visited this museum in March 2009. It was Friday mid-morning and we were the only visitors, which surprised me a little. We were greeted by a guy that talked too much and looked like a scammer. The tickets were $15. My husband is a fan of westerns but there were very few items dedicated to westerns. There was some interesting stuff about Max Factor and Marilyn. They had tons of pictures and some constumes.However, seemed like most of them were from less known movies. Dorothy's ruby slippers were not original (but nobody mentioned that) . We knew that that the original ones are in DC. That made me think that most of the costumes were just reproductions.We went on a tour of Warner Brother Studious earlier that week and they had much better stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolinaGirl27
50,"Great for fans of ""Golden Age"" Hollywood","My family and I visited this museum on July 24. Being a fan of Old Hollywood (from the silents through the ""Golden Age""), I really enjoyed this museum. It is located in the Max Factor building 1/2 block from the corner of Hollywood and Highland, about a one block walk from Grauman's and right next door to Mel's Diner on Highland. Part of the main floor of the museum reflects the days of Max Factor (including the old makeup), but there are also artifacts from some of the stars like Lucille Ball (including Desi's conga drum), Marilyn Monroe, and Judy Garland in the ""Max Factor Section"" of the museum. The rest of the museum is a continuation of artifacts, costumes, papers, photographs, autographs, and props from famous movies and movie stars. While we were there, the second floor was largely devoted to Marilyn Monroe, and had some of the costumes from her various films (including dresses worn by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon in Some Like It Hot), some of Monroe's own dresses and costumes, checks written by her, a pill bottle found near her when she died, etc. The rest of the museum contains props and costumes from a variety of famous films from the silent era through today. There are costumes from ""Wings,"" one of the more famous silent films, one of Scarlett O'Hara's dresses from ""Gone with the Wind,"" costumes and props from Bogart, Chaplin, Valentino, Bob Hope, Mae West, Joan Crawford, the list goes on and on. There are also costumes and props from movies like Planet of the Apes and from some more modern films like Moulin Rouge and Harry Potter. The basement contains a Hannibal Lector display and has more of a ""horror movie"" feel to it. If you are an old movie buff, this spot is definitely worth your time, as the museum is focused more on old Hollywood than on current films. It is not a very large museum, but we ended up spending almost two hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylmk
40,I enjoyed the building itself.....,".....the four rooms in particular. I personally enjoyed this museum - I had a couple of hours on my own and had breakfast at Mel's Diner right next door, followed by some time spent at the Hollywood Museum. There are some really cool exhibits and it wasn't too crowded. I'm glad I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohicans
20,Just okay,"We struggled to keep ourselves entertained for an hour in this museum. There isn't a lot of ""WOW"" factor here, although the Hannibal Lechter prison cell in the basement is cool. There are lots of pictures, dresses, and B-type memorabilia. As others have noted, no cameras or camcorders are allowed which hinders making any part of the visit a memorable experience. If you have children, try one of the other museums because this one will not engage them at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spotsandfriday
10,Boring,Don't waste your time and money. With the other attractions in the area this was a real let down. No photography was allowed and unless you enjoy looking a dresses and make up don't bother.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedwar
50,Fantastic for movie fans,"The Hollywood Museum has an impressive collection of old Hollywood memorabilia. The building itself is also very interesting -- it used to be the Max Factor makeup building. This is a great place to take tourists who want a glimpse into ""Hollywood.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VC1850
40,"Hollywood Museum: Enjoyed it, BUT ...","I dropped by the Hollywood Museum for the first time in November, 2005 and thoroughly enjoyed it, BUT no pictures were allowed inside - I had to leave my camera at the entrance which was very disappointing. I'm not sure what the rationale was since I would think a 'picture is worth a thousand words' when talking about vacation spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiFromIllinois
