50,Wonderful Wilson Park,"LA's best undiscovered park, like what Echo Park would be if it were not overrun by tourists. Stroll, relax, have a picnic, take a nap on the grass. It's perfect for all these things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancynancynator
40,"Saw ""Kenny G's Bar-Mitzvah!!""","Some friends gave us tickets to see a musical group called ""Klezmer Juice."" We had no idea what it would be like.
