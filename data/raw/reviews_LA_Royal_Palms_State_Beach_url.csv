50,nice beach,"Royal Palms State Beach is a beautiful beach. I went to the beach a couple of days ago. This place is not crowded. People like to walk in the shallow water. I walked in the shallow water to find some small fish, crabs, some seaweed and sea anemones. I’m happy to share this place with everyone who’s interest in going to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vivi012345
50,Favorite Beach for views,"The best beach to visit if you don't want to swim but rather enjoy the great vistas, tide pools, locals surfing, palm trees, 'smell of colitas', easy hiking and GREAT SUNSETS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmanlarry
50,"Tidepools, Rocky Beach, Beautiful","We really enjoyed our afternoon exploring the tidepools and running from the waves. There are two parts of the beach there's the rocky shoreline where you can access the tide pools at low tide and if you'd like to climb down some rocks there is a sandy beach as well.You do need to pay for parking and the cost of parking depends on the time of day. The parking kiosks do take credit cards. If you are willing to hike down the hill then you can park for free on the street.The beach area is very exposed with very little shade so if you are planning to spend the day here you may want to bring a canopy or umbrella. There are also not a lot of services so you'll want to pack in/pack out.Unfortunately this is not a nature preserve area and there are those who will come through the tidepools picking up animals and killing as bait or collecting them.In the tidepools there are some deeper areas and kids will be able to snorkel around. It's not super deep but it is deep enough that you can swim around a little bit.When we were there there was a lifeguard on duty.I'd suggest that you bring water shoes for the tidepools and the rocky beach in general.And please remember to clean up after yourselves!! There was quite a bit of trash and beach toys around, hopefully we can protect and preserve this beautiful place. It's a local gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,Royal Palms!,Please note its only a couple dollars to pay for parking if you drive all the way down to the cliffs. You have free parking at the top if you wish to walk / Hike down the hill. It is a wonderful experience. Have a picnic at the bottom or go fishing either or would do just fine. Or if you surf / sport go ahead and enjoy.Showers and Water at the bottom also with fire pits / BBQ to cook food.Give it a chance!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyJackson9
50,Love this place!!!,My family and I spent every Sunday here during the summer when I was growing up. So many fun memories. Now I go with my daughters and have introduced friends to this place and they love it too. So beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691susiem
50,A great place to watch the sunset,Royal Palms Beach in San Pedro is an amazing place where you can drive right up and park so close to the waves crashing on the rocks it looks like you can almost swim to Catalina Island from here the sunsets are amazing it's usually not very crowded. There are several other spots along here that you should also consider checking out if you plan on spending a day or part of the day here. There's also an excellent picnic area .this is a rocky beach. If you go down to the one in though you can walk for quite a ways before it gets to sunken city. sunken city is a part of San Pedro that fell into the ocean in 1929 you can still see some of the ruins from the Royal Palm's beach hotel here today when the tightest look very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drnasadan
40,Beach Lover,One of the prettiest beach in the Los Angeles area. Great surf spot but the locals are very protective and might test you. So if you are brave be respectful of local practices and don't steal waves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelv778
