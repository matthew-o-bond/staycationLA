40,Eat the cookie.,Amazing cookie. Is that weird? Lol. Stopped here on our tour of the island. Highest point and amazing up there. We didn’t eat. Just a huge cookie and not it was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luzsbrain
40,Interesting Part of Catalina,Our Conservancy tour stopped here for a midpoint rest and we found both the high (for Catalina) location and historic nature most interesting. The airport only serves private planes so there is usually not a lot of traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tingold1
30,Small Airport but Vital for the Island,This is the quickest way to get to the mainland by air where the mainland can be seen in the distance on a clear day. This is mainly a heliport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GordonW318
10,Do not eat here,"We took the shuttle to the airport to view some of the Island, take a hike and suggested by a few the excellent bison burgers and other food items. The ride was fine, saw some wildlife and views. The hike was great, foxes, birds, and a bison. The airport, the atmosphere, and view great, but the food and prices criminal. Eating at Burger King 4 stars in comparison.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCc827
50,Great Catalina Island Tour!,"Great tour up the mountain learning all about Catalina Island! Airport In The Sky has breathtaking views and an awesome interactive museum showcasing historical facts about the island and also all the endemic species use of wildlife there. Nice little restaurant where hot chocolate, HUGE homemade cookies and a variety of other gnoshing goodies are available. Lots of people in our group ordered their hamburgers and fries which looked delicious! Highly recommend! 🎉🎉🎉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishShark
50,Unexpected,"The airport includes a nice little snack bar, some great views, and a pretty good souvenir shop. This was the mid-point for our 3 hour jeep tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545charlies
40,Interesting airport,"This small airport is an interesting stop with a small restaurant and gift store. Their cookies get a lot of hype from the tour guides and we LOVED the peanut butter chocolate chip but thought the other two were just ok. It is a stop or turn around point for the eco tours so it’s nice to get out, stretch your legs, and look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karab730
40,"Cute, small little airport",We went on a ride across island to 2 harbors and stopped her for lunch. Cute little airport. Not too much here. Had a nice lunch and yummy homemade cookies. Bought a few things in the little gift shop. Worth seeing if have a chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southerncaligirl72
50,Fly in to Catalina Airport for Buffalo Burger,"I have been flying into Catalina Airport in the Sky since the 1970's. It is a very special place. Not much has changed, except a huge upgrade to the runway, thanks to the US Marines and donors. The DC3 Cafe has great food and the views from the patio are great. If you are lucky, you might see some Buffalo grazing, burrowing owls or a fox.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhr1442
30,Cookies didn't do much for me,This was our turn around point on the inland tour. We took a break and wandered around. Not much to see but it was nice to use the restroom and stretch our legs. I only commented on the cookies because our guide said they were really fabulous. Not so much in my opinion. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to see this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravelTerrie
40,Beautiful Views,I took the Skyline bus tour and this is one of the stops. Amazing! The entire trip was very over the top!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drely2
50,Skyline bus tour,Had an amazing tour guide that was very knowledgeable on the island. The airport was very cool we got to see giant navy helicopters land!!! 10/10 would recommend. Would not recommend for people with fear of heights or motion sickness,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q728JFmatth
50,Gift Shop,"The gifts here were well curated. Southwestern designed ceramic bowls, beaded hummingbirds, edible gummy shot glasses. Lots of tasteful gifts and cookies to snatch up while you wait for family to use the lavatory. The planes were privately owned. The cactus gardens interesting in variety, a path had informative flora and fauna explanations. There was a huge tile map! The views were great. You could sit outside if you were staying. We were on a Jeep Tour so it was a short stop for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9424IYsuzanneb
40,Fun location,"Ate here as part of a tour and the food exceeded expectations. The location of course is unique. Our guide said the cookies were the best on the island, and I’d have to agree.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justalegalgypsy
50,Great bus ride to the airport,We really enjoyed the skyline bus tour to the airport. The views were stunning and our tour guide was excellent. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncreid2018
50,Amazing food in an unlikely location,"I have celiac disease and was sure I was looking at having to eat another bun-less burger and a side salad when I was delightfully surprised to find that they have a stash of gluten free bread. They made me a turkey sandwich then threw in a second one for free because they thought the bread looked small. They even gave me foil so I could take it with me. They also had gf coleslaw that was very tasty as well as gf salt and vinegar chips. My friends without food restrictions also raves about their burgers, fries, and tacos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenr604
30,small,"A ten minute break during our Jeep tour, cute gift shop and yummy cookies. We saw a little fox while looking at the view and eating our cookies, don't feed them though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satellitesue1
50,This was a stop along the way around the island by tour....,"You just can't imagine that this is actually an airport...so so small. Grant it does service small Cessna's, Beach Craft type passenger planes. I believe the runway is 3000 feet in total. Cute souvenir shop, deli. Witness my first small plane crash the day we were there 7/25. All (3) passengers survived, ran out of runway. If you are not on an island tour of the whole island, I do not think that this is a place to go to specifically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P656QNjuliec
50,Nice food.,A nice place to rest after a long day of exploring. Great food - burgers and fries. Fresh homemade cookies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trounder
30,Not much of a destination in itself,"We stopped here during our jeep tour. It's neat to see a small airport up close (just a ""no pedestrians beyond this point"" sign separating you from the runway). But there isn't a lot to see. There's a hangar, a little shop and cafe, and some under-construction nature displays outside. Unless you are a fan of small planes, I'd say you can safely skip this stop on your Catalina trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anita8IceCream
50,Beautiful views,Nice bus ride from Avalon to Airport in the Sky. It's a mini tour of Catalina. Nice little restaurant you can get a hamburger or sandwiches. Little area to buy souvenirs from. I like to go to have lunch here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciajO2506BK
50,Great alternative to an expensive tour,"We came over for one night on Easter this year and wanted to take the kids to the interior of the island. The tours were nice but seemed very expensive considering we simply wanted to explore. My brilliant wife figured out we could take the shuttle to the airport for much less! We booked the tickets easy enough and had the entire bus to ourselves. The driver gave us a bit more of a tour than normal with some interesting facts about local life on the island. A heard of buffalo, around 40, decided to show up on a hill where they were blocking some hikers.Upon arrival at the airport, we were enticed by the famous cookies for sale and we took about an hour long hike around the airport on a well maintained trail. My 14 year old son loved laughing at the huge buffalo pies all around and we saw plenty of wildlife including foxes, squirrels and birds. Hopped on the afternoon bus down and had another pleasant ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddonati
40,Fun Stop!,This is a VERY small airport. You could pass right by it and not even know. We stopped here on the tour and it is a fun place to shop around for a little and grab a quick bite to eat. The airport is so small that it is for small private planes only.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike_Macrone
40,Good to eat the cookies.,The Airport was part of a tour we were on. The grounds are clean and a nice place to get off the bus and take a short walk around. There is a good gift shop and their cookies are big and fresh. Try the chocolate chip walnut oatmeal cookies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599RobertB
50,Best Cookies Ever!,We took a tour of the inland part of the island and conservancy and stopped at the airport for lunch. Sandwiches were great but the cookies were to die for! Also great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/185barbp

40,Small nice airport,"The airport is at 1,600 feet with a excellent view of the island. Small planes land or leave occasionally. The cookies at the restaurant are really excellent and worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethB381
40,Great trip for a first time visit to Catalina,"We rode the conservancy van from Avalon plaza to get up here. The tickets can be purchased at the Catalina Conservancy or online for about $32 r/t. We were lucky to see several restored WWII planes fly into the airport while we were there. We didn't see any bison, but others said they did on the van ride before us. There's a little gift shop and cafe at the airport and a nice trail around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestwoodTrekker

50,A charming little stop,"We stopped at the airport in the sky during an eco tour, this is possibly the best gift shop on the entire island!Believe it or not this little shop has everything you could possibly want, and most of it isn't found in other shops on the island. I would defiantly recommend treating yourself here.Great friendly staff were also another great point in the airport!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V812PCcarolinem

50,Cookies at the Airport,We stopped at the Catalina Airport on our tour with Journey Catalina. We had been told that the cookies were fantastic. Our tour guide was not wring. The airport is small but beautiful. There is a tile representation if the entire island that is lovely. There is a nice small gift area and very nice clean restrooms too. The view from the back of the terminal is lovely & the personnel are friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanaqlts
30,Very interesting stop,"While you are on Catalina, take the tour up to the airport in the sky and learn about how it was constructed. It is an interesting stop and an easy trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,"Way Up There, But Worth The Bumpy Trip","This is one of the coolest airports I have ever visited. At just over 1600 feet above sea level, it is one of the highest points on Catalina Island. The history of the place is interesting, and the Gift Shop is one of the nicest I have seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankD108

50,Nice stop on the Interior Island Safari Tour,"Enjoyed visiting the airport with my wife, daughter and daughter's boy friend. Their ""monster"" cookies are the best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26garrettt
50,Super Cute Airport - Very Short Runway!,"Flying into or out of this airport is EXCITING with a capital ""E."" Unless you come via helicopter, in a small plane the runway is super short and especially take off can be thrilling. As I recall you actually take off over a cliff so that adds to the excitement. Fun little airport diner in case you want to grab something simple like a sandwich or hamburger, otherwise not a lot going on here. There is a small visitor center/gift shop type of place that some of the tour buses stop at for people to see.Cute place, well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
30,Stopping Point on the Jeep Tour,"Took the Conservation Jeep Tour, and this was a stopping point. Not a whole lot here, airport; where we saw a plane land, restaurant; didn't have time to eat, other than a cookie (which was great) and a small gift shop. There also is a nice tile map of the island out front of the airport.Tip: If you're there, try a cookie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7888LZpaulw
40,Interesting history,We took an island jeep tour that visited the airport in the sky and enjoyed our stop there. It was interesting in its own right but it was made better by the history and background we heard from our tour guide. As a former pilot for the float planes that used to provide regular transportation to and from the island. Worth an hour of your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z89CBtimh
50,BUFFALO BURGERS!,"i love this spot, it is a very long scenic drive on a tour bus to get there; unless you know some locals with a pass, but just the burger alone is worth the drive! they have a gift shop and an incredible view outside while you eat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milvetmac
50,Great place to land,"Very unique place to land. Super friendly people in the tower and restaurant Don't forget the $25 landing fee. Go and have the Buffalo Burger! Then take the shuttle into town (Wildlands Express) these gys we super friendly and helpful, great day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussietrip77
40,I fly in here all the time.,"I like this little airport, it would be nice if they would re coat the runway. They charge 25 dollars to land here, and the bus ride to Avolon is 35 per person. Often I eat here, and get the buffalo burgers. It hasn't changed in the 30 years I have been coming. I like it just as it is. So if your a pilot, this is a great fun day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu
40,High in the Sky,"We took an island tour and one of the stops was the airport in the sky, I never knew there was an airport there, but it is a nice place to stop, watch the planes lane, get a bit to eat, have a beer or wine. They have indoor and outdoor sitting area and a souvenir store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwchatt33

50,One of the Hairiest Landings that I ever took part in,My Mom use to be a flight instructor before she retired from that Gig. But that was about 20 or so years ago.Anyways off we went into the Wild Blue Yonder. Then made a bee line to the 26 miles trip off the coast of LA LA Land.Now is this a VERY OLD Airport that was basically carved out of a top of the highest point in Catalina. (1600 feet) Its also a very short runway and I mean short.As it is one moment one is looking a the runway. Then all of a sudden it falls off into a cliff and you have about 500 feet altitude. Hopefully at that point you hope that you had a good mechanic looking after your plane. As I said before its is very hairy place.You also have to pay a $25 landing fee. But it use to have a good restaurant there. Which has some very tasty Buffalo Beef Burgers. Also the views are beyond description.You can also get there from Avalon by bus or car if you hire a ride from one of the locals. All in all it is an interesting place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
30,Great views but I wouldn't make a special trip,We stopped there as part of the bus tour. Not much up there other than an airport with a restaurant. Great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbrennan
50,Conservation Jeep Tour,"My wife and I took the Catalina Island Conservancy Jeep Eco Tour - a three hour tour of the Island. One of the highlights was a stop at the Airport in the Sky. Having flown planes myself in the Air Force I really enjoyed this stop. Pilots fly over here and land just for the famous cookies that they sell. AND they are really good. The only thing wrong was that over the mantel they have a Bison Head mislabeled as a Buffalo. I believe I am correct on this, but someone please inform me if I am mistaken. Unfortunately we did not get to see the Buffalos that roam free on the islands, but we did get to stop and see an Eagles Nest and some captive eagles. Folks don't just go out to Catalina to shop, spend money and drink beer! you can do that anywhere. Take the Conservancy Jeep Eco Tour and learn something and really see the island. The scenery was beautiful and all of us took many pictures. Our guide was very knowledgeable and knew all about the plants and animals. Ask her to take you on the ""Road Less Traveled"". It was a great adventure and they will get you back in time to catch the Ferry back to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebusinessforms
50,Visit this place!,"We visited the airport as part of our Eco Tour. The building is beautiful and sitting outdoors and enjoying the area is very relaxing. The gift shop has the best shopping on the island and the prices are great! The fresh cookies are huge, delicious and the best buy on the island. Can't wait to visit again and see a bison on the runway!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87pamelah
40,""" Airport On Top Of The World ""","We went on a tour on Catalina Island that lasted over an hour and we ended up at the top of the Island where the Airport in the Sky is located. When you get up to the top you feel like you are on top of the world. The airport is a small one runway airport that has some restaurants and museums to look at when you get there. It was a very nice stop before we started our journey back down the big hill, back to the water, and the piers in Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandslamhomer
40,Nice stopping point,This is a nice place to stop while on your way around the island. They serve lunch and are well known for their cookies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10234
50,Hidden in the mountains but worth it,"You probably need to hike here or take a tour. It is not near the hotels area, however it is totally worth it. The views to get here are great, the food is good and the cookies are great. Also try the bison burgers and jerky",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicazyoung
40,"Fun place to visit, great food","It's quite a trek but several of the scenic tours take you there-- and those tours are well worth it. Highly recommended. Make time for lunch!

40,"History, good food and wonderful views all in one place.","Not easy to travel to, but worth the effort. This is Catalina Island's airport....For small private aircraft and the Flying Boats for freight, the terminal was built with an eye toward information on island's geography (a significant built-in walk around model of the island), native flora (labeled gardens), and an adorable Island Fox who just happens to chose to live there (but don't feed it human food). The restaurant located there, the DC 9, has a nice menu with varied choices of very good food that can be enjoyed inside the comfortable dining room or out on the terrace with views of the ocean...And you might spot some bufflalo in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArizonaOD
30,Half way point on the tour.,"Bus tour takes you to airport. This airport is for small private planes. There is a small restaurant,restrooms, and agift shop of course.

40,Don't feed the cookies to the foxes!,"We stopped at the airport on our Catalina Inland Adventure bus tour.

Hey- we even got to see the island fox (begging for handouts)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MySoCalTeardrop
40,Interesting to see an airport way up in the hills,We were taken a tour on Catalina Island which included passing by the airport in the sky. Located way atop the hills of Catalina Island. This is just a very small airport more for privately owned planes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
40,Go for the Cookies!,"Stopped here on a Skyline tour. Loved our tour guide, very knowledgeable and super friendly. He recommended trying a cookie when we stopped in and I'm sure glad we did. The cookies are oatmeal and come in 3 flavors. Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Oatmeal Peanut Butter. I know that last one sounds weird but it was Oh So Tasty. Other than that there is a small gift shop, very clean restrooms, and a fireplace to warm up beside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyastokes
40,Island stop for small planes and tourists,"This was a lunch break stop for us on a bus tour. Found the food to be decent and the employees were all quite friends.

We were told quite a few celebrities have been through here as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernk
30,It is what it says it is.,"It is exactly that, and airport in the sky for small private planes only. There is a cafe at the terminal which I heard was very good and it did seem busy. They are known for their chocolate chip cookies. I had one and they are very tasty. If you go, check one out. You will also see buffalo and remnants from the show ""Fantasy Island"". It's worth the trip to try something new.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthmore
30,Not really that much to see unless there is a plane on the move,"I wouldn't recommend a special trip from Avalon just to visit the Airport in the Sky, the drive to and from here is much more interesting than the airfield itself. There is not much to see, just a small gift shop/cafe, hangar and control tower. Our arrival coincided with a very heavy rainstorm (the first for many months) and I felt very sorry for the hikers and those who had travelled up in open jeeps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000

50,Fun stop,The airport was a stop on my bus tour. Who knew there was an airport up there! Mine was a half hour stop so you can get food and drink and of course visit the gift shop.

50,Hiked from Avalon to the Airport in the Sky on Catalina Island,First I got a hiking permit from the Catalina Island Conservancy. I walked up the road from Avalon to the reservoir where I intercepted the Trans Catalina Trail. From this point I hiked the trail for about 2 hours. At the point the trail gets very close to the road I decided to walk the road the remaining distance to the airport. The trail is difficult with a lot of up and down portions. At the airport I filled my camel pack from pitcher in the restaurant. I returned to Avalon using the road. Several people stopped and asked if I needed assistance. I suppose I could have hitched a ride if needed. The total hike was 20 miles and took about 6 hours. The airport is cool and the restaurant is nice and clean with a cutie gift shop. It might be easier to take a tour bus to the Airport than to hike but I am always on a budget and the hiking was free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/capttml
40,"Swoop Over This Magical Isle, then Enjoy the Area.","Great spot for a $100 hamburger, assuming you like buffalo. We had the buffalo brisket tacos - very good. We flew in and for pilots, note that it is usually below minimums until around 1030 or later. But then, you can enjoy a flyover before you land, seeing areas you probably won't get to during your trip. Everything's accessible, assuming you like to walk. Once there, you can get lunch, shop (some great local items) and even do a loop hike before heading down. The conservancy bus is the major option (it's a LONG 10 miles on a very narrow road with traffic if you try to walk). Still, you'll get some great views as you travel down. People bus up from Avalon just to see it, so if you're a pilot, this comes with the journey. Book your return when you book your trip down - they do fill up and are only every 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseK173
40,AIRPORT ION THE SKY GIFT SHOP AND RESTURANT,"Our tour bus stopped at the airport for a 30 minute break so we all went into the gift shop to look around. You have to get one of their cookies while you are here, they are amazing. I have heard pilots fly over just to buy cookies to take home, I do not think they are quite worth that but are a good excuse to fly to Avalon.The burgers the people had looked very good and I have heard the food is all very tasty and the prices are better than in town.This is defiantly worth the stop.Check out the nature center while you are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
50,Don't Fly In Here!!,The Airport in the sky is an interesting place to visit..not just any pilot can fly here...Be sure to see the end of the runway..it just drops straight down!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg48_12
50,Great fries!,"I really liked the store portion of the airport in the sky. They had a lot of great items and the view off of the back patio is awesome. I only ordered fries on break from a tour and they were great, but everyone was raving about the buffalo burger. Its a unique place and the employees were really nice to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryMJackson
50,Private aviation,"If you are lucky enough to fly or have a friend that flies a private aviation plane, this is such a fun trip. The landing and take off are almost a bit scary due to the curve of the runway and so-so condition. The cafe and buffalo burgers are a must. If you don't fly in, you can take the shuttle (about 30 minutes) from Avalon or Shuttle up and a long, lovely, downhill hike back to Avalon. If you miss the shuttle, pre-order a taxi 30 minutes prior to landing, but be prepared to pay $110.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbg2020
50,"History Displays, Gift Shop, & Food","Don't skip the self-guided tour on the left side, and get yourself some homemade cookies whilst there!We were on a tour with Allan from the Catalina Transportation Services who was a wealth of historical information - must look him up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivPurple
40,Airport in the Sky,It was a very interesting and long ride to the airport. Saw three buffalo (bison) on the way up. So sad to see how dry the island is with the drought. Once we got to the top had a little time to look around. Not a amazing place but interesting. Saw the Wrigley plane fly in while we were there. The tour guide was hilarious!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karnyn
40,Catalina interior,"travel to Catalina's interior and see sights unavailable by boat. Enjoy a flight, bison tour or buffalo burger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
40,"SCENIC DRIVE, EAT, SEE SOME PLANES, AND HIKE ALL IN ONE","We really wanted to see the airport as well as do the ""airport loop"" hiking trail and taking one of the tours up there wouldn't have allowed us to do that so we took the airport shuttle.The ride up takes longer than you would think and they drive it pretty fast. There are several areas with some scary drop offs but is a beautiful drive. We saw some bison not even 100 yards from the road.We went first thing in the morning to try and beat the heat. Make sure you check in with the ranger up there before you head out. They like to keep track of who is out there. The airport loop was not hard at all with only minor elevation changes but it sure got hot really fast. Make sure you have good shoes on, have a hat, sunscreen, and lots of water. Remember to check in again with the ranger before you leave.We grabbed a quick bite to eat there at the restaurant before heading back to town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
50,Best meal of the week!,"I had a friend on the island drive us inland to see the sights. We stopped at the Catalina airport for breakfast. I had a breakfast sandwich and the son-in-law had a burrito and the grandsons also had breakfast sandwiches. They were prepared beautifully! A great meal. Also, the grandkids loved the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynndds
50,Great Gift Shop,"We stopped here on our Jeep Tour, wondered around the property for a bit and went inside to the gift shop. They had some really cute things in there and great prices. My friend and I both bought things, kinda excited I can now say I've started my Christmas shopping. LOL!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylW845
30,Go for Oatmeal Cookies,It is a long winding narrow (one lane) road with scary drop offs but worth the trip for the oatmeal cookies. Try all 3 flavors!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgfordham
50,"Yummy, Yummy","I know it's an airport but the HUGE cookies are the attraction right after the resident grey fox...maybe before. Not only cookies but great Bufflo Burgers. I highly recommend a shuttle ride or tour to the airport for lunch.There is a 2 mile hiking loop around the airport if you are so inclined. Catch a shuttle from ""The Plaza"" in Avalon to the airport, do the hike and then have lunch before catching the shuttle back.Several tours of Catalina's interior go out to the airport and stop from 15-50 minutes depending on the tour. These tours also start in The Plaza where tickets can be purchased.The airport has an active runway with private owners flying in and out all day long. This is also where the airmail deliveries to and from the Island originate. The airports activity dates back to its opening in 1946.Look for the fox behind the picnic table dinning area on the back patio. If your lucky he'll pay you a visit but watch your plate. He is a foxy fox always looking for a morsel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluewaterGypsy
40,"Small out of the way truck stop for winged, 3 wheeled vehicles.","Going to the airport by tour bus, private car, or airplane is a pleasant break from the 21st century. There is a small cafe, public bathrooms, a few sites to see. The drive up provides an close-up view of parts of the island most visitors never take the time to see.If this is your first trip to the island, go somewhere else. For the return visitor who wants to see a bit of the island up close and personal that most visitors never see it is worth the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catalinastayer
50,Only airport on the Island,"I enjoyed the ride to the airport, it is not accessible for the tourist private transportation, you have to take a bus or some tours actually make the airport a lunch stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snookiet
50,Great airport and stop for the weary to have a nice lunch.,Great stop that had a luncheonette and gift shop. One of the stops made on the bus tours. It was perfect for a midday meal or snack.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7825FClisac

30,Airport,"Ya, It's an airport. Great place to get a drink or snack if you are on a Conservancy tour. Get a t-shirt. Who doesn't want a cool Catalina Airport t-shirt? Did get to see one plane land on the short and what we were told not to safe airstrip. There were parts of a plane there that had crashed too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368garyb
30,Worth a tour or insider's visit,"Tucked into the interior of Catalina Island is the island's airport, which still received cargo and private planes. The airport is situated high up in the mountains of the island, so it's nice to get a view of all sides of Catalina (not just the tourist bays of Avalon and Two Harbors) and the locals love coming here to get away from the crowds and enjoy some good diner food. There is a lovely map of the island made out of mosaic tile outside the airport and restaurant, a lovely backyard patio, and don't forget to save room for a cookie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
50,Awesome food!,"I don't really care about the airport, but the food was great! Nice Tri-tips, and awesome cookies. We didn't know it'd be that good, otherwise we'd get like, a dozen. Also, has nice view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xmj2016
50,Be sure to get a cookie!,"In addition to usual food, they bake cookies each day that are delicious! Neat place to visit on a Catalina tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9416DWlindaw
30,Nice view,"We took the Skyline Drive tour and the Airport in the Sky was our ""layover"". The view was beautiful! So much history to learn about and beautiful architecture. The cookies in the gift shop are a must, huge and delicious! We even saw a fox from the back patio... Just make sure you don't feed them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8369VCveronicac
40,Cookie Monster,"It's true, the cookies at Airport in the Sky are killer good. My wife and I each had one while standing at the counter and took a 1/2 dozen to go. At $2.50 a pop, it was money well spent and a wonderful treat. Skip the corn dog and get yourself a cookie or three!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chictraavel
50,Vintage Airport on the Mountain!,It's always an adventure flying into the Catalina Airport! The runway is a bit bumpy but the people who run the airport are very nice and helpful. There is a shuttle you can take into Avalon and also a restaurant at the airport. The food at the restaurant is good and the views are spectacular! If you like to hike you can fly in and start a hike right from the airport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tallyholiz
40,Interesting place with great views and decent food. Check out the Catalina Fox.,Our tour stop their for lunch and it was an interesting journey to get their. Very high up in the mountains on some very scary and narrow roads you will find this airport. Some interesting sandwiches to choose from and beer and wine. Great location to look around and enjoy the wonderful scenery and nature. You will probably see the Catalina Fox begging for or stealing your food. The Fox weights about 3 pounds and is the size of a Cat. Very cute animal to experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317gregp
50,Wow- awesome find!,"The history in this place is amazing, and it felt like we had the whole museum to ourselves because it is hard to get to. The food was also great, and the whole trip felt like we were traveling back in time. We just loved our day here. The trip up was filled with spectacular views, and amazing encounters with wild buffalo herds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1062XEamyh
50,Hiking Around the Airport,"We took the airport shuttle--cheaper than a tour--up to the airport and spent a couple of hours there. We hiked on the trail that surrounds the airport and saw one of the resident buffalo herds. Gorgeous, panoramic views on all sides, with a charming restaurant and outside terrace waiting for us at the end. Shuttle drivers are friendly and full of great stories and info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquaBend
50,Stepping back in time....,"We stopped here for a well deserved and delicious lunch during our trans-Catalina hike. The food was great....buffalo burgers, tri tip sandwiches.... picked up a few more supplies and off we went. There were bison in the hills such a bonus. Small planes to watch coming in and out of the airport.. all in all, a delightful couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nansturn
30,Are we there yet?,We made the wrong decision to book the Skyline Drive to the Airport in the Sky. You get to see all the back roads (read dirt roads) of Catalina to get to this destination that the Wrigley's of Wrigley gum fame built. Quite the gem in the rough. Are we there yet?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjcnewyork
30,RIDE UP IS THE ATTRACTION,"Let's be honest here. There really isn't much going on at the airport itself. The ride up and the Airport Restaurant and the only real things going on at the Airport unless you were to catch a plane coming or going when you arrived there. So, look around at the so-so attractions around and enjoy the ride down. Ron and Pam",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avie8tor
40,The airport that time forgot - - so much fun,Out in the middle of nowhere sits this gem of a place that looks like it came from an old Gary Cooper movie. Food was good and staff was friendly. Excellent gift shop. The only criticism is the arrows that pointed to an airport history display led to nowhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petercatalano
40,"Cool place, awesome cookies!",This was a neat place to visit. Nice gift shop. Awesome (and big) cookies! Interesting bit of history up in the mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xgrinderx
30,"On the Skyline tour, this is the top! Had a cider and corn dog.","Its a quick 20-minute stop - can't order too much (no eating on the bus!), but I needed that cider - the drive around the mountains is great tho! Saw a fox :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandra_TX
40,Fun visit and great stop for food on tours!,We went to the airport as part of one of the eco tours and had a great little visit. There is a small museum as well as a well appointed gift shop and cafe. Nice outdoor seating and the door was reasonably priced and good. Gets busy when all the tour buses start to show up from the tours though...so better before noon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249tanyac
50,Airport in the Sky Bus Tour,"My wife and I took this tour on our first day and first visit to Catalina Island. Our tour guide and excellent driver, Steven, was very informative and humorous on the historical background and current news on Catalina Island. He got us through the bypass of a semi truck coming the opposite direction, was attentive to a Hummer tour vehicle with mechanical problems and rescued the tourists, getting them on our bus and getting them safely back to town. We learned and appreciated the current drought the island is experiencing, like much of California, and were very conscious of it for the balance of our 3-day stay. Thank you, Steven, for leading off our vacation with such an amazing tour experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enochm917
50,Cool spot,"The day I was there, it was foggy and the airport looked mysterious & a lil scary. It's fun, it doesn't take long to look around but I'm in aviation so I enjoyed this little airport. It was fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweeetkiwikisses
50,Must Visit,"We came up to the airport with our ""safari"" tour. Interesting place with great views. You can watch planes land and take off. Gift shop, restaurant and a nature center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islandgirl53
30,Great small airport,We visited this airport on the Skyline tour but didn't see any planes take off. There is a gift shop and a little nature center with some photos of animals. There is not much else here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
50,Visit the Airport!,"We went up to the airport with BikeCatalina. Randy transports you up to the airport in about 30 min. He has mountain bikes waiting to ride down to Avalon. Depending on your ability and stops, it can take up to 3 hours to ride down. Super fun if you like biking. The tiny Airport is wonderful to see and watch all of the small planes arriving and taking off. The restaurant is good with indoor and outdoor dining. The small gift shop has cute Catalina Airport tee's to buy. The Airport is designed in Spanish Colonial style. Riding down can be challenging with rolling hills to conquer before fully braking on the downhill to Avalon. The views of the island are amazing. If you are lucky, you will see a herd of buffalo grazing by the side of the rode (like we did). Not very crowded. I think people don't realize this is a ""thing"" to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262beth
40,Good times at the Airport in the Sky,The landing is a little deceiving - the runway looks really short but it's more that long enough. The Airport in the Sky has a little restaurant and gift store. The bison burgers are really good but the real draw is the giant cookies. Wow - what a treat - especially the peanut butter chocolate chip. We've seen the bison from the air taking off and had a Catalina fox (cute little indigenous species) cross the runway in front of us. You can visit from Avalon on the bus as well if you don't fly in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garuba3
50,Top of the world Ma.,"We took the bus tour up to the Airport in the sky. Vintage bus, narrated ride, beautiful scenery and access to the roads which you just cannot access in a golf car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retiredgenman
30,Back to another time in history.,"This is an interesting experience because it feels as though one has traveled back in time to another era. There is a cafe and gift shop. Nothing worthwhile in that regard but the experience is worthy of a visit at least once. Maybe hiking up to it, if you are able to would be the way to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armine21
50,The Island Made With Tiles Is Beautiful,"It was fun to see the little museum, with very interesting pictures and taxidermy. There's a beautiful construction of the map of Catalina made with tiles, it's just gorgeous, the airport is very small but fair enough for an island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimexicogdl
30,Interesting but not a lot to see when the mist closes in!,"We were unlucky in that the day we chose to visit, the weather turned and the sea mist came rolling up the hill.But the cafe is very welcoming!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
40,Not easy to get to but a fun place to visit,"The Airport in the Sky has been around for a long, long time as a tourist destination. Most visitors are people on tours from Avalon, but a very large number are pilots and their passengers who fly in from the mainland, sometimes just for a bite to eat or even just a cup of coffee. I've been there both ways, mostly flying over with friends or my student pilots. I'll never grow tired of visiting it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wgriff1
50,Awesome experience. Highly reccommend!,We took the 1953 bus from the town square up to the airport in the sky. Freddie was our tour guide and he was fabulous! Very knowledgable and interesting and kept us laughing the whole time. We saw a bison on the way there and got amazing pictures. Once we were there Levi was working in the store and was very helpful and pointed out some local and fresh favorites hand made and produced on the island!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenj353
40,Small Planes or Helicopter,We are pilots so wanted to see their airstrip. Its perfect for small planes. No jets. On top of the island so the view is spectacular. Only experienced pilots go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HavBagWiLLTravel
40,Nice Afternoon Trip,"My wife and I took the airport shuttle from Avalon to spend a couple of hours at the airport just after the first of the year 2016. This excursion wasn't the most economical thing we did on the island but we did enjoy our day. The shuttle trip was a little over $60 for the two of us. The ride there and back is slow and bumpy but it was nice to see the island from a different view. Once we were at the airport we hiked the airport loop trail which we enjoyed very much. The trail is nice and isn't very steep and I think took us about an hour to complete. After our hike we stopped in at the restaurant and ordered a bison burger. The food was really good and the service was quick. The gift store is nice with lots of things to look at; they had items you couldn't get in town. The only bummer part of our trip is; I bought two bags of bison jerky that apparently fell out of my pocket on the bumpy ride back into town. So I only had one small piece of this amazing jerky and lost the two bags I purchased. We left the island the next morning early so I never had a chance to ask the shuttle people if they found my bags. Oh Well, life is still good. Over all I give it four stars as it was a great destination for a hike and lunch and we really enjoyed our day, it was just a bit on the expensive side with the shuttle trip. lunch prices and everything else was pretty much in line with average island pricing. The day we were there the airport got pretty busy at lunch time with lots of pilots flying in with friends and family. Lots of fun seeing all the planes and people. If you have never done this; you need to do it at least once. I am about 50/50 if I would do it a second time (only because of the shuttle cost) but very glad we did it once. One other note; the loop trail was nice on a cool overcast day, I wouldn't want to be out there on a hot summer day; it is similar to hiking in a desert mountain, take water with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cameron351
50,Great little airport,This is an historic facility that includes a restaurant and gift shop. You will enjoy checking this out and the ride up from Avalon is interesting for its terrain and wildlife.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47MER47
40,"Stayed over a long weekend, fulfilling a dream. Dogs ok, but...","If traveling with dogs, you must use $110 taxi for 20 minute ride into town. Limited tie-down space. Landing fee + reasonable parking fees. Picturesque short hiking area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robdM5141CV
40,"Fantastic, but........","A fantastic place to visit and was fortunate to fly in and out of it once. Love it's charm and amazing control tower. The hanger near the main building was, I believe, the original one built for the flying boats years ago.The shop/restaurant area is worth a visit and the Buffalo burgers are legendary.However one or two of the staff could do with a customer relations course, particularly the elderly lady who was very rude to customers queuing up at the till.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foileyer1
50,"High ho, for this airport will delight","Delightful little airport in the sky, as its name suggests...... we arrived by a tour car having seen bison on the way from Avalon. Wonderful little garden with carefully marked plants. Gift shop has a bit of everything...... we watched two small aircraft take off and had the place to ourselves on a late autumn day. Restful and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whereiscookie
50,Your,A must see journey. Unless you have a car or fly in - you need to see it via a tour. Several tour company's have tours. We took the Discovery Tour - Skyline tour. You leave Avalon on 1950s bus - fully narrated. At airport you get to see the airplanes and airport building. Nice restaurant and gift shop. A must see while in Catalina!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBH1995

30,Really not much to see,"It was part of our excursion tour of our cruise. The 40 mins bus ride was relaxing, but the point of interest were our own ship, possible buffalo (not native species of the island), the airport with small airplanes, and possible airplane taking offs (which are not announced, and we missed the only one during our stop).Most people on the island are on vacation and just want to relax. But for the airport itself or for the bus tour to get here, really not much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol0143
50,An interesting airport!,We went on a self made tour with the taxi service and he took us up to the airport. You can go up in the tower and watch planes take off and land. There is a huge map of the island outside thaht you can walk around and get a perspective on what sites there are and how far apart they reside on the island.Really cute gift shop inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriplePisces2
50,"Come visit the Airport in the Sky in Catalina Island! Tour bus, golf cart, plane? It's your choice!","Yes, come visit the Airport in the Sky! by tour bus, golf cart, or plane... Your choice! If you are interested in aviation this is a must see while in Catalina Island. There's a restaurant and store for those must have souvenirs! We visited and have our beautiful coffee mugs and souvenir glasses as well as tshits. Everybody is so nice and friendly and we had a fantastic picnic that we brought during our bison tour. Loved the Airport in the Sky and the beautiful and spectacular views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianamZ7652FX
30,Good View,Took a tour bus here. Good view and we saw buffalo on the way there and back. The view was good up there and the food looked good from their snack bar but we didn't eat anything. Nothing else to do there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90donnag

50,Love the map title of Island,Love those buffalo burgers. The Island made made with local titles is a great learning site. Not much air traffic the day we came.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nissan1515
50,What a wild ride,"We were lucky enough to have a family member who has a plane. Landing was a little scary, so be sure you really know what you're doing. Runway is short. Everyone is friendly there at the store and tower. Cute souvenirs, clean bathrooms and decent food. They supply a shuttle down to town, but you must have reservations prior to landing. Also times are ""approximate"". They run on island time, but for some reason, that really didn't bother us. It's very bumpy and if your prone to car sickness, don't ride up or down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandra608
50,What an exhilarating take-off!,"I had a friend who owned a 4-seater Cessna. He decided to fly me to Catalina Island which necessitated using ""The Airport in the Sky"". One has to be a very accomplished pilot in my estimation, in order to land and take off from that airport! This has to be one of the most dangerous airports to take off from in the world as it has a short runway and at the end of the runway is a huge drop into the ocean! In other words, at the end of that short runway, you will either fly or go for a swim! It was exhilirating to be a passenger, as I knew I was in the hands of an experienced pilot! :) Taking off from this airport is not for the faint of heart!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoforeignlands
30,Interesting tour stop but not extraordinary,"We took a bus tour that stopped here. The airport is interesting in its location and background, but isn't that spectacular. You can go up to the second floor of the ""tower"" (that term is an overstatement) but even there you don't really see much, despite the location of the airport at a high place on the island. You see more from the tour bus getting there than you do from the airport itself.The gift shop/restaurant has great cookies--be sure to get one. There's also a unique map of the island painted on tiles, and a small nature exhibit. But all of these together really didn't elevate this to more than an average tour bus stop. Worth stopping, but nothing extraordinary to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94741233
50,Catalina Airport - check out the VIEWS!!!!,"The little store in the airport was wonderful. Although some things were pricey (which is normal for touristy items), I found a wonderful reasonable priced items for my family which will serve as Christmas gifts!!!

30,Nothing Remarkable,"We went to the Airport in the Sky during our Skyline tour. It was interesting to learn about the history of the airport and how it was used during WWII. But other than that there is nothing really compelling about the place. They raved about their cookies in the cafe, but they were average at best. Honestly, it was a waste of time. I understand why it is on the tour but it is almost enough to advise people to take a different tour. Don't waste your time if you don't have to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8468OFkevind

50,Airport on top of Mountain,"I was impressed that there is an airport at the top of a mountain. I went on the ""Safari"" Adventure Tour and the vehicle drives all the way up stage coach road to the airport and then back down. Impressive. Excellent views, photographers will love this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Floridian
50,Worth the ride to sea this sky top treasure,"there are a couple of tours that will take you from Avalon for the 10 mile trip to the airport in the sky, but don't be fooled by the distance. it takes about 40 minutes to make the trip over a narrow, winding and scenic road. The airport is historic and charming. You can go up to the tower and be most welcome. There are DC 3 that land daily with supplies for the island and watching them is a treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francineo101
40,Unique & Fun Airport,"The airport is a big part of how the island functions. We stopped here on an inland tour, learning some great tidbits of trivia and history.

50,Airport in the Sky,"This is a stop on the Inland Tour, and a real gem of the Island. Try a Bison Dog while you're there and check out their unique gift shop. Found some great souvenirs for myself, which is rare!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegasjenn06
50,Great little airport,"This airport was a stopping point on a bus tour that our group took. It is a small airport about ten miles outside of downtown Avalon. There is a restaurant, gift shop, and rest rooms at the facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90622
50,Mountain Bike Ride,Rode our mountain bikes up from Avalon 10 miles to the Airport in the Sky. 1602' elevation from Sea level. Tough ride but worth the adventure. The views were spectacular and we also saw a buffalo on the way. The restaurant was great and defiantly happy to have some food before our ride back down. The road was rough and a bit hairy so stay alert!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickis613
50,Great stop on inland bus tour,This was the mid-point of the inland bus tour we took. DO try the cookies in the little gift shop...fabulous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sosborne98
50,"Up, Up, And Away!","If you are traveling to Catalina and staying in Avalon for any period of time make some time to take one of the tours that stops at the Airport in The Sky. The Cape Canyon Tour, and The Skyline Drive Tour are two good options. This small airport has a landing strip for small planes as well as helicopters and it has been in use by both for decades. It is a part of the island's history and it is an interesting and exciting stop for all aviation nuts. They have a small restaurant and a gift shop, and it's not unheard of to see a Bison or Catalina fox on your way to the airport! It will only take about an hour there to enjoy this stop on your Catalina adventure and it's a fun stop with lots of interesting memorabilia about the island. While you're looking at tours find one that will take you for a quick visit to the airport in the sky!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodvilencia
40,Bit of a hairy drive,Took a tour to the Airport in the sky - quite a hairy drive! Worth the views though. Had a great cookie and coffee in the café up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayne-Steve
50,Loved the buffalo burger!,Can't wait to go back as I don't think I will find the equal on the mainland. The buffalo burger was so delicious and the staff very accommodating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eabarrdvm
30,Unique place for an airport.,Not much to see other than the runway and a restaurant. We hooked up with a service that provides bike rentals to the airport. He drops you off there and you bike down to the harbor. The beginning has a couple of steep hills but most of the trip was downhill. You pick your own pace and stop as much as you want. Great way to see the island. Beautiful ocean views and open grazing land for buffalo which we just missed seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brillfrogs1
50,Wonderful!,"The ride up was scary since i am afraid of heights. But the view was awesome, and the giftshop was very nice. The only bummer was that they were out of the bison jerky i wanted to try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilmh2015
40,Airport in the Sky,"The Airport in the Sky was a stop in a tour that we took. We had lunch there -- tri-tip sandwich and chocolate chip cookies. I think it was one of the most delicious foods that we had on the island, considering its price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicki820
50,Interesting History and Interesting Airport,"While taking a tour of the backside of Catalina Island and to see the buffalo, we ended up at the airport on top of the mountain. It was a very small landing strip. So small that if you don't land just right you could run off the cliff. Just a couple hundred feet, if that. In addition to the small airport, there is a small museum inside the airport ""terminal"" that shows the history of the airport and it's importance to the island. The history of the airport also includes stories and pictures of movie stars who have either arrived via a small plane or flew their own plane onto the runway. It was a delightful ending to the tour that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289martib
30,Cute Little Place,"It was adorable, but just a cute little airport inland. We had lunch there and it was good. The views were great thought. I don't think I would have gone if it wasn't part of the tour, glad I got to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bzytraveler63
50,One of my favorite places on the Island!,"The Airport in the Sky is a spectacular piece of living Catalina history. Many aviation milestones happened here. Today it is an obligatory stop on any interior trip, and one worth the time. Food is excellent (you must have one of their home-baked cookies and some bison jerky). A sweet and varied store, great outside sitting, and a nature center with many native plants and history. The tile map of the Island is an amazing piece of art. Check for the summer BBQs which are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosLdelaRosa
40,"Worth a visit, but pricey","It's a $100 hamburger run if you're a pilot-- decent burgers, great cookies, and a beautiful flight over the water. If you're coming up from the town, it's a nice hike and a good way to appreciate the island's interior. Unfortunately, it's expensive to get to either way-- shuttle bus from town is over $20, aircraft are charged a $25 landing fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plattypus1
50,Hiker Friendly,"If you are backpacking through Catalina, this is a good place to have breakfast on day 2 of the hike. It's only 2 easy miles from Black Jack Campground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalugoz
50,Charming! Historic airport-SCENIC DRIVE & NATURE TRAILS!

40,Charming!,"A tour I was on stopped here for about 45 minutes. We had some delicious chili, bought a few souvenirs, and then spent time outside, looking at the plants and the scenery. It's a serene, bucolic place with a rich aviation history. Very enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476erine
40,Would like to have stayed a little longer.,"We stopped here as part of Conservancy tour. Great little shop and deli! There are some pictures and history stuff on the wall near the restrooms, but it is all faded. Hope they redo it soon. Pilots would appreciate this stop, as this runway is a bit unique, but other than that, it's just a tiny little airport!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857colleeno
40,A must stop.,Every time on the island we venture up here. Most recent visit was with family and we enjoyed the gift shop and their famous cookie. Always find great gifts here and at a reasonable price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevePSP
40,A worthwhile tour.,"The airport is the upper most point of this bus tour. The airport is nothing too remarkable except for the fact that it exists.The drive up and back was very scenic and the narration by the guide/driver, Stephen, was excellent. Chocked full of informative, interesting and entertaining lore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1845YNdavide
50,E Ticket Ride...,The tour costs $50... the bus costs $32... no brainer.Yee Haw... that little girl bus driver must be related to Parnelli Jones. The airport was fun to visit... do not miss the Bison Hot Dog or Bison Tacos...And the ride alone is a bargain... :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpguess
50,Really Cool Airport,"We visited the Airport in the Sky on a Hummer tour. We actually had lunch there and enjoyed the nostalgia as well as the food. It is an interesting place to visit, but would recommend doing it with a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldtravelagent
50,Worth the trip,"Got to see a totally different Catalina. Wild buffalo, beautiful vistas, incredible winding roads with steep drop offs. Very cool above the clouds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxoo1119
50,Take the airport shuttle bus if short of time and the tours are full,"If you arrive on Catalina and haven't already reserved a tour it will be difficult to find someone to take you out of Avalon and into the back country that makes up 99% of the island. The airport shuttle bus provides an available and cheaper alternative. For around $25 you can reserve a ride to the ""airport in the sky"" that takes about 40 minutes each way. These depart on even hours and return on odd hours throughout most of the daylight hours. The driver can adjust his commentary to the group and we learned a great deal about the island's water supply, its drought problems, the history of the local bison and an assortment of other topics. The views are, at the very least, beautiful though the ride can be bumpy for some. Once up on top it is a good idea to grab something to eat at a time when none of the tour buses have pulled in, for then you will have an extended menu to choose from and quick service delivered by friendly staff. Sit outside and enjoy the views as well as the decent food. Afterwards climb up to the tower to pay for your ride (they didn't collect fares in Avalon) and quiz the knowledgable man who serves as air traffic controller. He will periodically break away to communicate the latest wind data to aircraft. Apparently this was John Wayne's favorite small airport though it has a reputation for testing first time users because the runway has a hump that keeps much of it out of sight of pilots coming in for a landing until their wheels have touched down. Wind shear is also an issue on this mountain top site. We took the airport loop trail for an hour, noting the dried up water troughs, some snakes and arriving or departing planes on the way. You can see most of the 21 mile long island from here and learn something about the dangers of drought and wildfires. Well worth an afternoon and perhaps preferable to tour buses that often don't stop for long enough anywhere you'd like to stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taughboyne
50,Killer cookies,"Hard to get to from Avalon unless you fly in they serve their famious buffalo burger, hot dogs and tacos. Save room for their Killer Cookies. The best cookies I have ever had. Baked fresh daily. Also, home made potato chips. Yummy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theguyin4B
50,Beautiful view and good food!,"Stopped here with a tour.Great break spot...unique souvenirs, GREAT food (buffalo tacos and killer cookies), and amazing views. Really enjoyed seeing this unique airport and talking to the managers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyd65
30,the airport from Fantasy Island,If you had time the food looked great! It was clean with great restrooms. Our bus was running late so we didn't have time to sit and enjoy the food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookies575
30,Nice Place for a Bathroom Break,"Stopped at the airport as part of a trip to the inland. Small airport, clean, nice bathrooms. Runway is a bit sketchy from local reports, I would be hesitant to fly in here unless you have a very experienced pilot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElkGroveChris
30,"Fun to see, but don't go out of your way to get here","The Airport in the Sky is really cool but I would not go out of my way or make a special trip to get there. I visited as part of a tour through the interior of the island. I chose the tour specifically because I wanted to visit the Airport in the Sky, but I would not waste money taking the rather expensive bus ride that only goes to the Airtport in the Sky. Once you get there, try the cookies, they really are good. Go up to the first floor of the tower and chat with the airport managers there--they're very nice and can tell you a little about the history of the airport and the planes that are there. If you're lucky, you might even get to see a plane take off or land! Other than that, there is not much to do. There is a small gift shop and cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefabforneret
30,"Great Airport Food, ok Site","Eat the bison burgers. While the burgers aren't made from the bison on Catalina, they are lean, tasty burgers. Also try the cookies. They are delicious.As for the site, it's OK. I don't know if I'd Ho again, but the ride getting there was lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanK419

40,Great views!,"We took a tour that took us all around the island and stopped at the Airport in the Sky for about a half hour. I was bus sick but it was still appreciated and I had no idea there was an airport on the island so that was definitely cool. At the top they have a cafe and gift shop, nothing extraordinary you haven't seen all around the rest of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBear227
40,great killer cookies,Great place to have lunch or snack and cold beer. Prices pretty reasonable. Cookies were huge and worth trying.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DyanAnderson
50,Pretty cool place,"a nice piece of history here, gotta be a great pilot, it's a really short run way. But neat to get there through the inter part of the island that you usually don't get to see otherwise",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlwtaw9493
40,An Airport on the Island,Clean good stop and impressive that planes can land and take off on what appears to be a short runway....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808erict
50,Airport in the Sky,"The Bison burgers are the best. The view is spectacular, and you can't leave without a ""killer cookie"". They are delicious and definitely big enough to share, if you have to! This stop was included on a tour. We were lucky enough to see a small plane land, and another take off as we toured the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478pauletteh
30,A nice stop!,"It is a nice 30 minute stop for our Skyline Drive tour after an hour or so of the winding bus ride. It's so alone on top of the mountain and it's the kind of place I'd like to be during a vacation. I bought one of the giant famous delicious cookies and relaxed at the patio at the back of the store/nature center with the serene view of the valleys, mounts and glimpse of the ocean. We saw a few green humming birds near us. I don't think you can get here via the winding narrow road we took other than flying in. With that said, I don't think I would recommend this as a destination unless you would enjoy the trip on the way up and down which I did but my friend was nervous almost the whole time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S4613HDkarent
40,Great Views,"Small general aviation airport. Visited as part of a tour, did not fly in or out of. Has a small restaurant and gift store. Show cases the areas cactus and allows for a good view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wavcpa
50,Exceptional Views,"For an experience mountain-biker, the ride up to the airport and back is steep but provides gorgeous views. For an un-experienced cyclist, take the shuttle or another tour up to the airport. The road is very steep and bumpy, and the ride back is a white-knuckler (unless you enjoy that kind of ride on a regular basis.)There is a great grill up at the airport, stunning views, some short trails (1-3 miles) to enjoy, and the occasional buffalo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamSelz

50,Super Duper,We took a bus tour to the top and the Airport in the Sky was the highlight. Super duper fun. They have a great gift shop and lots of yummy snacks. The history is amazing and it's a fun excursion if you have the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalValleyGirl
50,With seeing if you know what you are looking at,"I had heard about the Airport in the Sky since I was a kid as my father is a small aircraft pilot. For me, the Airport in the Sky was well worth seeing, but I could easily see how it may be dull to others without that background. We were able to see multiple take-offs and landings. The best take-off was viewed from below the airport and looked like the plane simply flew off the end of the mountain. Also there is a fox that lives in the clump of cacti newar the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tostrand
40,Surprise Landing!,"With the Avalon heliport fogged in, we were forced to land at the Airport in the Sky and shuttle down to town. Quaint little gift shop, fresh baked cookes and a nice outdoor patio with a view! The ride to Avalon is bumpy with lots of curves, but fun to see the buffalo along the way and the view of town from ""above"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveBNMommy
40,UP to the top,Informative and exciting ride up to airport. Driver very informative and funny. View exquisite. Some of party went up into observation tower.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ca-native48
50,Completely fabulous top-of-the-world feeling . . .,"as we landed down a narrow strip of a quite bumpy runway on Catalina Island, having taken off 30 minutes before from McClellan-Palomar airport in Carlsbad. It is indeed an ""Airport in the Sky"". Wandered around the area, which has a cactus garden, a vintage bus, nice bathrooms, gift shop, and good hamburgers and french fries. Sat outside to eat overlooking mountainous Santa Catalina. Apparently the rind down the mountain is bumpy and long--taking at least an our to reach Avalon. But we were content to stay in the airport area. Really a complete treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787sallyb
50,Bumpy Ride but Worth the Torture!,Great views and bumps along the way by WWII bus and the ride was worth the bison burgers once we arrived. We also saw many bison along the way and a cute little baby Catalina fox at the airport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771RonJ
30,Great cookies but the drive is nothing special,"I bought the tour to see the island and airport. The island is primarily a desert, and there was little life to be seen on the drive to the top. I saw a few buffalo, one close to the bus because of the water tank by the road. Despite the fantastic cookies, the trip was not worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anyamare
30,The shuttle ride was great but destination is plainer than expected,"The ride there is lovely looking at the trees along the road and the mountain & ocean views. Saw one buffalo on the side which was fun to see. Once we arrived, very chilly at the airport, some cacti gardens and a plain little restaurant. Really serves as a functional airport and meets the needs of these clients. Ride up on the shuttle is pricey $32 per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgomez2468
40,A must see,"We only stayed at the airport for 20 minutes, would have liked a longer stay but what we did see was fun, historic and beautiful. The oatmeal cookies were the best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy026
40,26 Miles...,As the song from the 50's goes...Santa Catalina is the place for me. One of the best activity to do is the ride to the top of the island to visit the airport and all of the island on the way. You really can't understand the history of the island and the size except on the tour. Highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/942jimmier

40,A favorite day trip,"This is a favorite day trip flight from San Diego. Love flying in here for a buffalo burger and a killer cookie. Enjoy the views from the back patio, or from the airport loop trail if you're up for some exercise. Added benefit, you'll probably see a bison along the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbE5631GI

50,scary but amazing,"views, views, also saw bison, and the airport itself is great saw a DC 3 takeoff all visitors should at least take this tour, when you reach the top besides the views and watching the planes land or take off the best cookies ever for $2.50 each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862agnesp
40,Oasis between Blackjack and Two Harbors,"This is a great stop if you are backpacking. We hit it a little early so had breakfast. You can skip making coffee and cooking breakfast at the campsite and go straight here - it's just a two mile, but one hour backpack trek. Heard the Bison Burgers were great but too early for lunch. We did buy sandwiches to go and ate them at Little Harbor. Also the only place to pick up hats/t-shirts on the trail if you are backpacking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindym576

40,Thrilling place to land and take-off,"If you are in a hurry to get to Catalina or the Mainland, head to the airport for a 10 minute hop. The airport is on a plateau and it makes for an exciting landing or take-off. Very nice scenic spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB

Very well worth the trip! Lots of old Catalina photos, good shopping, and a fun atmosphere. Great views from the windows, once you get to the airport restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaxmanLG
40,Quick Drop In,Arrival by air at the mountain top is breathtaking. Short but safe landing strip. Many fly over from the mainland for a scenic lunch. Renowned for their cookies and buffalo burgers. Catalina-centric gift shop. Accessible by road. Tram tours from Avalon provide a very pleasant drive. If you look close you might see buffalo roaming near the roadway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamusb
40,A fun stop on our visit,"The Airport in the Sky was a fun stop during our tour of the island. We stopped for lunch, their amazing cookies, and a souvenir. They're planning to build a museum, and have just acquired the plan that Mr. Wrigley used to fly to the island. Great views from the airport given it's location and elevation. GREAT STOP!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalIrish

50,One of the nicest spots on Catalina,"I had the pleasure of visiting the airport in the sky a number of times whilst I was volunteering on the island, and I'd love to get the opportunity to go again.The food is wonderful, being a vegetarian I was sad not to be able to try some of the incredible sounding burgers, but the veggie options are more than good enough. Sweet potato fries are a real treat too.And the view. Wow. Simply stunning, one of the nicest places to sit and enjoy a lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W917YRdanielp
40,Great view,We were there as part of a tour so only had 20 minutes. I would have liked more time there. It is well worth the trip to the top of the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebWen1954
40,"Killer View, Killer Cookies","Saw the airport on the Skyline bus tour, nice nature center, tile map of Catalina. Gift Shop very good. They make large moist cookies that are worth the stop!

Airport on high hilltop- so great views too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristio329
40,interesting stop on our tour,"we took the Inland Island Adventure with Charles and had a great time. He was very informative filling us in on all the details of the island history, as well as the information about the wildlife. We saw a few bison and then stopped at the Airport in the Sky. Watched a few small planes take off and land...looked like fun as well as had a little walk around...This was really an interesting stop on our tour. If you have time, take the tour and enjoy the Airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foster070204

50,Awesome!,"Though very cliche in the pilot world...""you must try the buffalo burger there"". Well, as a pilot and a cliche enthusiast I highly recommend this burger. I flew in here with another pilot, and I must say, the buffalo burger (though cliche) is awesome! Could be one of the best burgers I have ever had, (Red Mill Seattle currently holds this title). I had the buffalo with blue cheese and bacon. This is a really cool airport to fly into, enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesertFlyer
50,Loved the cookies,Our tour guide took us here and recommended the big cookes. of course we had to try them. Cookies were amazing and the airport is a cute area on Catalina.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbCooper
40,Take a bus to an airport so you can take a hike.,"Yes, take the bus up to the Airport in the Sky so that you can go hiking. The bus ride itself is well worth the trip. It really lets you see a lot of Catalina Island. Our original plan was to hike back to town, which turned into hiking halfway, which then turned into just hiking the trails that go around the airport. That was right about 3 mile I think. Maybe a little less. The trails are pretty well marked. Hard to get lost but we tried our best. We were hoping to see some of the wild buffalo but they were elsewhere that day. A nice hike with great views. The airport itself has a little gift shop and cafe. The folks that work the bus tours and work at the airport could not be nicer. Very accomodating. Oh, there is no fee for the airport itself but you do have to pay for the 35 minute bus ride. You pay when you get to the airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmcbrayer
40,Food with a view,"Located about 35 minutes from Avalon, this is worth a trip. The food is good, the cookies great, and you get a wonderful sense of Catalina's interior. A bird feeder or two would be nice, but that's quibbling. Friendly staff and a nice little gift shop with some different kinds of items. Did I say the cookies were great? They're almost worth the trip by themselves. There's a nice little hike that circumnavigates the airport (1.5 miles in total) where you can even burn off the cookies afterwards. Wear good shoes, however, as the terrain can be prickly.Tip: if you go early or late, you'll see more of the island's great fauna.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poochkin
30,Enjoyable drive to it,We took the bus tour and really enjoyed the scenery on the way to airport. The airport is nothing special but we did see the bison on the way back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britladd
50,Still one of the coolest airports I've been to,"I love coming to Catalina Island. Flying in makes it that much better. The airport itself is so unique and has plenty of history. Plus, that $100 burger becomes a buffalo burger here! Take a ride into Avalon and enjoy the city before having to fly home. Worth the trip, again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateLeben
50,Great Get Away,"We landed at the airport in the sky after a cruse around the island, it was beautiful. We went up to the tower and met some great people, George the airport manager and Richie, well what can I say Richie is Richie. He is always smiling and happy. He treated us like famaly with tips where to stay and eat. He recommended the El Terado Terrace as a Hotel, boy was that a great tip. We decided to have a buffalo burger before we went to town. It was great and once again great people and a cute gift shop. I bought a t shirt with a Beechcract B36 on it. I have a B36 and I have never seen anything like that before. Oh Ya they got BEER, after flying of course. Then we got on the shuttle to go to town and low and behold there was Richie as our driver and guide. He shined once again. He seemed to know everything about the island and most of the people that lived there. He even knew the buffalos by name. Thanks everyone at the Airport, You made it fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895tracyb
40,"Great views, fun hike, excellent lunch!","We took the Wildlands Express up to the airport, did the 3 mile loop hike around the airport and then ate a buffalo burger - one of the best I've ever had - before we headed back to Avalon. Great 3 hour trip to see a bit more of the island (and some buffalo), without taking a more formal tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mel_m25
40,Long winding road to see a bison,"Went on a van tour as part of a package, and met at the ferry terminal. Guide was very knowledgeable, and had lots of tales to tell. He also was very experienced on the narrow and winding roads of Santa Catalina Island. Once at the airport, there is a restaurant, and small garden/eco area to see. Good intro to the terrain of the island you do not get to see in Avalon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anymember
50,"At the edge of the clouds, a fantastic fly-in","As a pilot I have had the chance to fly to many small airports in private airplanes, and Catalina is one of them. This airport sits atop the edge of a cliff at one of the highest points on the island, flanked by cliffs on either side and a dirt strip used to land an old DC-3 flying cargo in from Long Beach (quite a sight, though I think they don't do that run anymore?).The airport itself is quite challenging, and I have trained many pilots on the landing techniques used there. Certainly, not a place a private pilot should try without an instructor or the mentoring of a friend who has been there before. The runway is rough, with many bumps, potholes, and optical illusions. Despite this it is a fantastic place to fly.During the summer they have bbq cook out nights right at the airport restaurant, with live music and delicious food. Even on a regular day, you can fly in, grab a buffalo burger and enjoy the serenity that is only a 30 minute flight south of the busy Los Angeles basin.If you're staying in town, it's a fun place to visit for the unique atmosphere, some outdoor plaques and exhibits talking about the island, the yummy cafe, and the gift shop. With no fences, TSA, or any of the pains of a typical airport, this place really embodies what flying used to be to the general public, so grab a burger, sit at the edge of the runway and watch the planes touch the edge of the clouds that sit just at the end of the field.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PositiveRate23
50,A rarity,"Carved off the top of a mountain by Wrigley of chewing gum fame. Sports some nice historical pictures of aviation history. Can walk into the inland bush directly off the runway. Easy transportation into town. $26 per person round trip. Very scenic and perhaps scary with the hairpin turns. You may well come upon a buffalo, too.Landing fees have gone up. No fuel. Must leave before sundown. Interesting cafe serving up local buffalo burgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9703TSwilliamd
40,short visit at the airport.,Fun to have a bite to eat and watch the small planes land and take-off. The staff was very friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottC309
50,Tour to the Airport,"I have been on this tour several times, and each time had a different driver, and each time learned something new. Although my girlfriend had spent several summers here with her family as a child, she'd never been out of Avalon proper, except to Descanso Beach, so she was soaking in all of the beauty that this tour has to offer, as well as learning a lot of the history of the island. The tour guides are all very knowledgeable, sharing silly jokes, and driving us safely there.And the cookies available only at the airport are wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jp6902
30,just an airport where you can see up close,"took it as part of tour. the airport is up in the mountains, you can go close to the small aircrafts,can see take off and landings if lucky. cafe is good too. certainly a must first time. after that no so much unless you are flying ofcourse!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vkailash
50,fun to go there and learning,It was pretty nice fun and learning experience to go to airport in the sky. The tour goes from mountain roads where you can see pretty many of the sights and buffaloes too. After reaching at airport in the sky we had nice time to take pictures near planes and on run away :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COOLDUDE0110
40,Seems relaxing up there.,"We did go in off season (December 22, 2013) and early in the morning (9:30a) so it seemed very peaceful up there. We saw a small plane land, got to go up to the tower to the 2nd floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeneT1234
50,"Great View, Nice History, Good food","Was on a tour of Avalon and went up to the Airport in the Sky. Found out that the mail is still flown in daily weather permitting from the mainland, Kinda cool.Lost of history behind the playground of the rich and famous, and the not so rich and famous.Also great little food stop on your tour of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AARDVARKKILLER
40,Flashback!,When was the last time you visited an airport and could walk out on the runway? A small gift shop sells some delicious cookies or you can dine at the small snack bar. A great stop on our tour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCSunshine21
40,Buffalo tacos,Went here on a tour and this was the best part of the tour. First of all the patio provided a super view of the area and was cool and comfortable. I ordered the Buffalo Tacos which came with a side of chips and salsa and of course had one of thier famous Oatmeal/chocolate chip/walnut cookies. The buffalo was very lean and the tacos were very good! Good meal but very expensive for what you got.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbzap
40,Pretty Cool,"Not much to see. The historical hangar was pretty cool. There's a snack bar and gift shop. The prices on souvenirs were much less than in the shops in town. *Tip: the bus driver will sell you on the ""Killer Catalina Chocolate Chip Cookies"" they sell at the snack bar. They are okay, not ""killer"". I don't recommend the cookies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCAngel
40,Smallest airport ever,"It was cute. We were actually on the Skyline tour bus and stopped here. Views are amazing. Didn't have time to have lunch because I'd miss the bus back to the city. Other than that, it was a nice view of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamHTX
50,Worthy Views,The view from the Catalina airport is worth the drive/ride. My only regret is that I only bought one cookie. There are no other cookies as good as the ones sold at this airport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJCAN
20,The food venue couldn't serve much food,"We stopped here during a bus tour of the island, expecting to be able to have a quick, but tasty, lunch as was described by the ticket booth and bus drive. When we arrived, there was already a long line. There was a tour bus menu, which did not offer hamburgers (which had been specifically mentioned by the ticket booth personnel). Then an announcement was made that they coudn't serve any food to our group with no explanation!? The view was okay, but we had to watch other people eating and enjoying it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB1114
40,"Smallest, highest airport",We took a private van tour of the island with one of the stops being this airport. The airport was one of the highlights of the tour. The views were spectacular. It is mind- boggling to think of using this airport out of necessity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginiaY_13
50,Airport in the Sky,"It was cold the day we visited and the hot chocolate felt great. Also, found the souvenirs here different than in town and more what I like to buy to bring back home. Again, this is a bldg that has been around a long time and well maintained. The drive up, with many views of bison (one up close) and a Catalina fox, was a great way to spend the afternoon on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maigheu
30,Nothing Exciting,We were there because our jeep trip stopped there. Not that big of a deal. It's small and not much to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggieminn
40,Inland motor tour destination,It's an interesting motor trip to the Airport including breathtaking views from the ridge and potential buffalo and fox sightings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susankX5159WC
40,Good food with a view,"Had a great sandwich one day and a fabulous cookie on another day. We made this a destination one day to see more of the island and this was a great place to hang out for awhile. There is a gift shop, great views, an interpretive area about the island. There's a easy trail around the airport, but we were cut off my several Bison. Very memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FSRetired
50,GREat view and food,Great views and the food at the cafe was excellent.....gotta have a cookie too!!! The best tuna melt ever!!! Worth a trip to the top.....great views on the way too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/410pattyk
50,Catalina Airport,Very interesting place in the middle of now were. Good COOKIES. Good place to pickup those refrigerator magnets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hatgeekkk
50,What a Cool Airport,"We arrived at the Airport in the Sky via our Skyline Tour. It was a nice break point from our bus tour of the island. This respite abides atop a mountain with an airstrip mostly for small planes, but I overheard someone say they actually flew a DC10 there, too. There's a small nature center there and a very nice shop there where you can get snacks or sandwiches or gifts. There is a nice small café setting overlooking the mountains where it is nice to eat lunch or sip your coffee and relax. I wish we had more than 30 minutes to stay, but our tour had to continue on. Very nice airport. I love the original hanger built in 1913 I believe. Make this a stop on your tour if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444katherinej
50,Skyline Drive Tour,Ok I never even knew there was an airport in Avalon!! My boyfriend and I did this tour and it was amazing. Fred our driver was funny and knew lots of info about the island and the buffalo which I had never seen before. The airport itself was cute and cool to see and the views getting there were breathtaking!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaj493
40,Great View,This is a great destination while you are on the island and a fun way to see the buffalo and history of the island. It is also fun with kids when they watch the planes taking off and landing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7amye
50,So kind!,"I came to the DC3 airport / restaurant for one of their summer BBQ's with my scout troop. Before getting to the island, the staff (Lisa) was so friendly and helpful in getting me information and our reservations in order. George was great in helping us with transportation to the airport and helping us find a short little hike to take while up there. The BBQ? DELISH!! Again, the entire staff were fun, friendly, and just plain kind. They helped ensure all my scouts had what they needed. We also really enjoyed the live music. Thank you Airport in the Sky!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571amandab
50,Fun surprise,"We stopped here during our day touring the island. A little oasis -- history of the island, good food, clean restrooms, and a delightful gift shop. Worth the stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404Barbara
40,A perfect stop along the TCT,"We stopped at The Airport in the Sky for lunch on Day 2 of our 3-day backpacking adventure along the Trans Catalina Trail. The airport was a lot more interesting than I expected as there is a lot of history in this place and many interesting planes can be seen here. We watched a number of them take off or land as we were hiking in. The main attraction here for us was the food. After 1.5 days of camp food, I was ready for a buffalo burger! Although the food was very expensive, it tasted good and the patio dining area was very comfortable with awesome views. The gift shop has some surprisingly nice souvenirs (backpacks and jackets were really nice!), and we bought a locally-made ornament for our Christmas tree (a family tradition when we travel). Be sure to take time to go across the street to the soapstone quarry. There was a geocache there that I wanted to find, but the quarry itself, used by the original native Americans, was very interesting. Well worth the quarter of a mile hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarkSolstice
40,Take the Bus up and Ride your bike back to town,"We brought our mountain bikes on the trip with us with the intention to ride out to the airport and back. Found out, its about 10 miles there - UP HILL and I wasn't looking for that much exercise! So it was suggested to take a bus up and ride back - down hill most of the way.The airport has a nice deli with pretty good food, great patio to enjoy it on and check out the trails, buffalo and planes coming in and out. There is an island information center with a massive tile map of the island, info on the conservancy and history of the island and its residents - human and wildlife.You do need to purchase a bike permit from the Catalina Conservancy to ride out on the trails and its pricey ($26 per person) but well worth it - best views all around, you can see to Two Harbor and ride some of the campground trails on the way back, we saw buffalo out doing what they do and all the way to the mainland! It was a very easy bike ride back since it was down the whole way and we spend about 3 hrs on the various trails and ride back. Make sure your brakes are in very good working order, Im not kidding when I say down hill the whole way.Quite a great excursion !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenke
40,Beautiful,The trip up the mountain alone with the sea air and the fragrance of the woods was exhilarating. The airpor in the sky is a sight to behold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyO166
40,Beautiful Airport...rocky ride into town,"Landed at Airport in the Sky for a beautiful small wedding in July 2013. Couldn't have been a more beautiful day. Nice trip ""26 miles across the sea."" Old airport hangar provides a nice backdrop for pics. Lovely location for the wedding...blue sky and buffalo in the background for the ""I dos."" Ride into and out of town was a bumpy ride...but well worth it. Both the airport and Avalon are terrific destinations. And the scenery along the way is breathtaking. Looking forward to a return visit. Landing fee and overnight parking fees are steep...but for a special treat...it's ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryj43
40,Early Ride Up,"Take the early shuttle up to the airport and you ride up with the staff. They quickly got the place up and running and we enjoyed a great breakfast before heading out on a long hike back to town. Lots of history here, so take the time to explore before heading out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/378CarolB
40,Worth the bus ride to get to the airport,"We took the bus tour that took us to the airport and back. The gift shop at the airport was nice and well stocked, with excellent, large homemade cookies. There was a nice, docent led exhibit of the native fauna outside the gift shop/restaurant, clean bathrooms, great views, and lots of historical information.The most exciting, though, was the ride there and back - winding roads, herds of bison (some very close for good photo ops), and a funny knowledgeable driver, who was born and raised on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/784BobH
50,Well worth seeing!,"Part of our tour was to visit the Airport in the Sky. Great history attached to this tiny little airport. Watched small planes coming and going on a 3,000 foot runway. Brave pilots! Offered a gift shop and little restaurant with some wonderful rustic mountain type decor. People are very friendly and the cookies are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mackeyfour
40,Worth the visit,Interesting historical exhibits. Food was fine....my first buffalo hot dog :). Home-baked cookie was excellent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jrryo
40,Tricky airport to land in,The landing strip actually has a grade change in it. Slightly unusual I would think. Great spot! The cookies are killer. I've heard stories about the Coast Guard choppers landing there just for the cookies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenC35
40,Airport food?,Amazing views on the ride to the airport. The french fries are excellent. Very neat experience..bring water in the summer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larrytravels1615
30,Quaint location with decent food,I enjoyed the bison hot dog and the fries were will cooked. I am not sure that is is worth the ride/drive unless you actually fly to or from the location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Techkraut
50,Santa Catalina Island Company Airport in the Sky,"My family and I just rode the shuttle driven by Charles to the airport. I could not ask for a more educational and entertaining experience. Or driver was knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt. I recommend the Santa Catalina Island Company's ride to the Airport in the Sky to anyone who wants an exciting and pleasant activity to do on Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837christinem837
50,Escape to the clouds,Traveling to and from the airport in the sky is half the fun. Be sure to hook up with the Conservancy in downtown Avalon because they are the key to enjoying the island fully. Hiking the trails around the airport is a must do and quite educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avohill
30,A little disappointed,We took the Skyline Drive Tour (which we enjoyed) that goes to the airport but there wasn't much to do there. I thought there would be a view of the water. There's a snack bar/lunch area but not much more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milo7961
50,Country side,I saw a Catalina fox on that tour and our guide Eddie was soooo funny...the only that I did not like was there is no restroom up thre......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ernaesthers
50,NIce place for a break!,"As any place on Catalina, there is always a little history. There are bikers, hikers and other people who make their way there. Has great food, and beverages. Has a great little patio in the for dinning overlooking a canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/304Dweebie
30,Not much to see,"This was a definate tourist attraction. Lots of signage to take your picture, gift shop and restaurant. Not much else there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachlfe4me
50,Great adventure,Great adventure fly in get a great discount at the El Terado as a pilot. Stop in for a great Buffalo Burger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517BruceE
40,Surprise,"We took the shuttle to the airport to start our hike on the Trans Catalina Trail from Airport in the Sky.From the airport you get great views across Catalina. It's a nice drive up there too. The airport has a fab restaurant with nice and very reasonably priced foods. It also has a gift shop with some nice quality things.You can walk around the airport and look at a few planes (and a digger for our digger-mad toddler). There's also a cactus display (again, a big hit with the toddler).As with most of Catalina, the staff there were super-friendly and accommodating to our needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_Leics
30,"A Nice Place to stop, but only if you're on a tour","I definitely wouldn't of gone here if it weren't part of the tour. It takes a long time to get there and although it's really beautiful, it's an airport. I'm glad we stopped and saw it, but it really was nbd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbgirl-forever
30,Did the loop,"Nice easy 2 mile walk with spectacular view almost at the end if you do the loop starting out going right. Not much wild life on the walk, lots of cactus some in bloom with lovely yellow flowers. One or two slight inclines, mostly flat. When the marine layer rolled in at 4:15 PM it came in fast and cold, bring a jacket if you will be there during the time of year when that occurs at the end of the day. Our drivers in each direction were very informative in different ways, one gave us a good overview of festivals the other gave us local history. We took the Conservancy shuttle because we like to walk around on our own. 2 hours at the Airport was about right for this trip. It takes about an hour in each direction for travel time so allow a full morning or afternoon for the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EZGoing50
50,The only way to do Catalina,"We love Catalina's Airport in the Sky offering shuttle rides to town, clean restrooms, good food, and a great gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonnieP146
40,Buy a cookie!,"Beautiful, scenic spot to take a break after a fantastic ride on our 1953 bus excursion through Catalina Expeditions. Great bathrooms, wonderful little store and views for as far as the eye can see. Be aware though, there is a young woman working in the store that is a customer service horror story. Rude rude and even worse. Wish I had gotten her name. Rest of staff was good. Buy a cookie! Oatmeal Chocolate Chip worth every calorie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phemail007
40,Scenic ride to top of the island,"We took the tour bus up to the airport. It was a scenic ride and once we got there, well worth the trip.Only saw four buffalo off in the great beyond on the way up. It was relaxing to walk around and sit for a spell at the airport. Didn't see any planes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daruth
30,"Small gift shop, food, interesting displays","Not much to say...interesting mosaic map, labeled plants on display and informative panels. One runway airport. Nice clean bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrnrMom
30,Airport in the Sky,Definitely interesting but cafe food very expensive. Walked around for a few minutes but windy and very cold. Really not too much to see but don't regret the drive there and back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanbW60KX
40,have to go up there,getting there we went on Catalina Adventure and took us to the top and a few planes there on mainly delivers mail for the island etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kittytoby
40,flying high,We took one of the bus tours and this was including. Interesting but nothing speical. View was pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitzy82_13
40,Great views and hiking,"Didn't actually fly in or out, but took the shuttle from Avalon to the airport ($26 each for round trip), ate lunch at the little cafe, then hiked the Trans-Catalina trail. The views were absolutely gorgeous, even though it was cloudy for the first half of our hike. We even saw a buffalo in the distance while hiking.If you're looking for some good hiking trails, I highly recommend you take the shuttle to the airport (leaves out of the Tour Plaza in Avalon, make sure you make a reservation), get a map, and pick the trail (there are many) that suits what you're looking for (length, views, etc.). The drive up is amazing - we saw foxes and buffalo and some gorgeous views. If you want, you can even hike down the road back to Avalon and have the shuttle pick you up along the way. Make sure you plan it out with them ahead of time, but I highly recommend walking along this road; the sights were stunning - green rolling hills, ocean views, and we could even see the Long Beach coast in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaV609
40,Neat place,"In all honesty, we stopped there on a tour just to potty and get a snack.They have a cute little gift shop-pricey but nice.I had a coffee and a wonderful homemade cookie.We spent about $100 in souveniers. :) Beautiful views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCVTravelers
50,Top of the Island,Great History. At the airport there's a large Garden/Nature Center with local plants all labeled. Interpretive center with geological history of the island. There is also a nice little cafe' and gift shop. Be sure to buy one of the great cookies they are always baking. Divine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YAYASister70128
20,Killer Cookies.... not so much,"Went on a tour and the final destination was Airport in the Sky. They advertise the 'killer cookies' as the best chocolate chip cookies in the world - frankly.... I've had better at Mrs. Fields in the mall. Restaurant is a top a summit and takes what seems like forever to get there through a rugged/bumpy road. Wasn't really interested in any of the overpriced souvenirs in the gift shop and the food selection was nothing to 'write home about'. It's a trip you should take if you have time to kill in Catalina, but its by no means anything memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RH513
40,Good tour of the island interior,The airport in the sky was included in a Conservancy Jeep Tour of the island. Excellent tour and good to see eagles and the scenery both of the interior of the island and of the coast - would recommend. It was chilly and we were glad the jeep had blankets. We could have done with a warm hat and gloves! The airport in the sky was very much appreciated both for the views and also the warm drinks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344jans344

50,Great place to eat!!!!,"Had a great breakfast prior to a 10 bike ride back to Avalon - downhill :-) We love the hummingbirds, and were told about the great BBQ's hosted here in the summer with entertainment!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyR205
50,great place for lunch!,"Didn't fly in, but our tour stopped there for lunch. Staff was super friendly, and lunch was good and a reasonable price. The view out back was spectacular, and the cookies were AMAZING!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliCarri
50,Airport in the Sky,"Completed in 1946, the Airport in the Sky is1602 feet above the Pacific Ocean. It is built between two mountain peaks in the middle of Catalina Island. There are essentially two ways to get to the airport. The first is by plane. The runway is asphalt paved and is 3250 feet long. It is convex shaped, higher in the center. This creates problems during the approach and landing. Visual perception is misleading. Too fast you could go over the end or too slow you could encounter downdraft. This is not for inexperienced pilots. It does accommodate planes up to a DC-3. The Wrigley family used the airport as did John Wayne. The other way to get to the airport is by land. That is how I arrived. It is about 40 minutes from Avalon through land owned by the private conservatory. The terrain is rugged with steep narrow inclines, gravel roads at times and switchbacks. Shuttles run about $28 round trip and inland excursions can be booked. At the airport there is a restaurant (Buffalo Springs Station) which serves good Buffalo burgers and their ""Killer Cookies"" which are huge. The staff is super friendly and will help you in any way. There is a nice gift shop, clean public bathrooms, hiking and biking trails and a history display of early settlers. A huge map of Catalina Island is in the courtyard. On your way to the airport you are likely to encounter free range buffalo, fox and other wildlife along with scenic vistas and photographic opportunities galore. It is unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duck8to
50,A little piece of heaven!,"What a treasure! We visited the Airport in the Sky while on our Cape Canyon Expedition. The restaurant and shop are nice and cozy - it was a crisp, cool day outside, but they had a nice fire going in the fire place. The Buffalo Burger and fries were delicious! The service was great and the gift shop had lots of neat items to choose from. There were a lot of old photos and lots of historical information. We enjoyed our visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB262
30,Quaint,"Small, friendly, great buffalo chili. We took an Eco Tour and our stop was at this airport. We were pretty much the only ones there as our tour only had 4 people and the tour guide. It was a nice place to sit and relax before taking the bumpy ride back to town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhittierTraveler
50,Fun and learning experience,"While traveling up there we saw a bison and the rare dwarf fox up close. The tour instructor was very knowledgeable, humorous and answered all the questions we had that we were secretly wondering about and more. She said she gets a gift card if we mention her name... darn I wish I could remember it... Theresa... good thing my husband never throws paper away",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kharizmah
50,Worth the price of a tour,"In order to get to the Airport in the Sky, you have to take either a shuttle bus or a tour. The road up is windy and steep, and parts are gravel, but the scenery and views are worth every minute. At the airport you can dine on a buffalo burger while you watch the dozens of hummingbirds that visit the patio. The gift shop is also worth a lengthy visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristineT315
50,Bus tour to the Sky,"We took the bus tour -- Skyline Adventure, I believe it was called. Theresa, our driver and tour guide was excellent. She has a great personality and is VERY knowledgeable about the island, even though she has only lived there 3 years! She pays attention, obviously, and is a wealth of knowledge and humor. Try to take her tour if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miklep

50,Coolest airport I've been to.,"Whoe knew Catalina had such a cute airport?! I took a shuttle up to the airport, round trip costs about $25. From the airport there are so many hiking trails in all directions. Take the shuttle up early and hike all day, head back to the airport for your lift back down to Avalon. The airport also has a restaurant (with GREAT cookies and lemonade-perfect snack after a hike), gift shop, restrooms, great views, and some Catalina history. You can enjoy your snack while watching bison graze and planes land and take off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleneR842
50,Great Cookie,"This stop is a most and is on most tours. Nice gift shop. Be sure and try their buffalo burgers. Buffalo meat is from Montano, so you're not eating the Bison in Cataline. And they are famous for their ""GIANT"" cookie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoungSeniorCruiser

40,A very good and inexpensive lunch atop Catalina Island!,"Near the end of the Catalina Expedition, you will stop at the DC-3 Gifts & Grill for a quick lunch before heading back to Avalon. The Tuna Melt is fantastic !The airport caters only to private aircraft and can be quite busy. Don't miss this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shitzky

Yummy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leona0212
40,Skyline Drive Tour and Airport in the Sky,"We reached Airport in the Sky from the Skyline Tour of Catalina Island. This tour travels 10-miles inland from Avalon through the private Conservatory land. The older bus is driven by a very knowledgeable driver, who helps visitors learn something about the conservatory land and the airport as well as the lands along the road. The airport is small and servesmostly priavte planes but there is a daily flight from the mainland to bring supplies, mail, and visitors.Airport-in-the Sky is a modern facility with charm. A gift shop, restroom facilties, and a cafe serving burgers and the like, are available.We enjoyed this tour and two senior tickets were $39 each. Allow 2 hours and 15 minutes for the tour itelf. Meet in the Avalon city center, where all the tours depart. Reserve space ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Violette54

50,Great fun to fly in to!,"My husband and I enjoy flying our Citabria into the ""Airport in the Sky"" and having breakfast on the weekends. It is a great, little airport, and the staff couldn't be more friendly. The restaurant up there is superb! They have a great fireplace in the winter to enjoy your breakfast by or a lovely patio with amazing views of the island. The gift shop has great items for purchase as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kabrooks
50,Great fun,"We took the Skyline bus trip to the airport and back. Best way to see the island if your time is limited. See the buffalo herd!! WIld deer sometimes foxes appear. Lovely country side en route, Airport was small but intresting non the less, food did not appear to expensive and airport staff friendly, to the point of taking a photo of me standing next to a light aircarft. Intresting island map huge thing at the airport and gardens too. All in all the skyline trip and airport are great value",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaFoale
50,"New favorite ""$100 Hamburger"" destination!","If you fly into the Airport in the Sky, do your research. The flight in was awesome, the clouds were low on the water and below the Airport. The runway is convex, so when you come in you are below the top of the runway, it appears that you are heading into the cliff--Land short and you could smash into a cliff; Land long and you could end up off the other side of the cliff.The visual clues out there are totally deceiving; that by trying to avoid landing short, you could end up coming in way too high and have to do a go-around.However, on our first attempt, my husband put the plane down right on the numbers … awesome! The runway was not the best I've seen. Even though it had been recently resurfaced, it was a little bumpy; there are no services out there. There is a $25 Landing Fee that you pay at the tower.For our “$100 Hamburger”, we actually had a hamburger … a buffalo burger. For dessert, we had their awesome “killer cookies” … OMG, the oatmeal raisin cookie must have weighed a pound! Which undoubtedly will turn into 2 pounds at the waist.All the people were very nice and friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAMROX69CA
50,Airport from an era gone by,"If you've ever been to a small town served by a regional airport, you probably have a basic idea of what the Airport in the Sky is like. It has a basic eating area and a novelty shop, but it also has a nice outdoor dining area from which you can look at Catalina's interior, and it has an old Americana feel that has probably disappeared from many other regional airports around the country. Worth a stop as part of tour, or if you actually decide to fly to Catalina (haven't done that yet).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craiggerman
50,Brilliant place!,"I went up to the airport on a tour, and when we arrived, we saw wonderful views and had a great time seeing little planes landing! What a great experience. Inside was a small restaurant and shop - try the cookies!!! Wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pirateminnie
50,great sights,It truly is amazing to see all the little planes coming and anding.. also has good food and drinks!!! great staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megank593
50,Tasted a local brew,"Great view, clean restrooms, interesting nature center, I wish we could have stayed longer up there! Looked like the people were enjoying their food too, cute gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriC428
40,Historical Place,Stopped by at there when we went for Cape Canyon Adventure Tour. It is a quite nice and historical place to visit. Try the cookies ! It's quite nice ! :D,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneT212
40,"""A part of history with a view""","The airport plays a vital role in the lives of people in Catalina island then and now. During World War 2 and currently as part of the USPS delivery system as mentioned by our tour guide/driver. The airport was under construction when we came by so it was closed to large planes. The chocolate chip cookies are really good, but I wished we could have stayed longer so I had a chance to taste their buffalo burger. The bag that my daughter bought from the gift shop is even cheaper compared to a lesser quality you can buy in the mainland. Worth the trip plus scenery along the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neborr357
20,"Horrible bus tour, long drive, not much to look at","We traveled by bus tour (do not do!!! that is another story), my husband wanted to go specifically to see the buffalo...well, the tour bus guy would not stop for pictures of the few buffalo we did see. But, the bus driver did stop to watch the zip line because he enjoyed watching that...and he did stop to look at a release pressure pipe for the reservoir that was on the side of the road and he did stop to show the spot where he would leave cookies for the crows. It was horrible...the views are horrible, the bus ride was stuffy, with bad smelly air and the Airport in the Sky was boring and nothing much to look at. If you must visit this place, do not go by bus...try the large, open hummer vehicles tours...that at least looked cool and comfortable for the 2 hours ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoLM_58
50,Nice place to visit,"It was an interesting place to stop and have lunch. If you visit by choosing Catalina Transportation Services private Back Country tour and engaging Chuck as your guide, you will learn lots of very fascinating facts about the airport. The food was good. It should be on the list of must sees when visiting the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanD810
50,Gorgeous Views,On the clearest of days my brother flew us over in his small plane. What a way to see this island. Stunning. Airport has transportation into Avalon. We could see the buildings of LA from the airport. Amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginnyd6323
40,Part of Avalon History,Chocolate chip cookies were GREAT! Loved looking at the mounted pictures and news articles. Scenic road up to the airport with gorgeous views of the island and the Pacific.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancym822
40,Feel like you are really in the SKY,"The day that we were there was not a clear day.The visibility was low and you really feel like you are walking in between clouds, love the feeling!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuteReise88
30,Pilots Reference Point,"I have been flying in to Catalina for the past several years and an please they finally did something about fixing up the runway. Landing on Catalina is charming because it feels as if you are on vacation even though you might have just flown from one of the local airports along the coast 26 miles away. I often fly in and hike around the island for a few hours, which is perfect because when you finish hiking you can stop in at DC 3 restaurant for something to eat.I guess the place is famous for it's buffalo burgers but I'm not much of a burger person. I have had the sandwich's and they are OK but the chef could use a little lesson from some of the chef's featured on Guy Fieri, Dinner's Drive-in's and Dives. If I might suggest, don't pile the meat up in the center of the sandwich but rather distribute it evenly over the bread so that you don't end up with few bites out of the center and the rest all bread. Also, you might come up with a dressing or two for the sandwiches. The cookies are really good home made and wonderful but be warned, they can fill you up. So eat your meal first or don't eat a meal and just eat the cookie. This restaurant is really just a grill and the food is the least attractive thing about visiting Airport in the sky.There is not doubt that seating outside has a wonderful view. Sometime you will see Buffalo down in the valley and certainly if you hike around you might run into a buffalo face to face. I don't think you really have anything to worry about if you do encounter one because they seem domesticated and docile. But always use caution.Enjoy the place it's lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macaponnetto
50,Buffalo and a terrific view.,".We had the delightful all you a eat barbecue, once a month, music and fun to see how big this island is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642maryw642
30,"Small airport, nice views","If you want to cover important places in Catalina definitely this is one of the top 3 items. There is a small garden, cafeteria and gift shop just like any other visiting place. Trip to this place is worth to get scenic views on the way and from airport if weather permits. My daughter enjoyed looking at small planes landing and flying. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SatyaVummidi
40,Fun,This was a nice destination for our tour group but not much to see. We did get to see the Buffalo up close,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Topmommy
30,Great starting point,"Highly recommend this as a starting point if you would like to walk some of the Trans Catalina Trail. Unique tiny airport accessible only by authorized vehicles, there is a small store, restrooms and little restaurant. I'd recommend going there on the Catalina Conservancy shuttle, reasonably priced, knowledgable driver who is very accomodating, and the fee supports the Conservancy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saysomething123
30,Sure this is great on a clear day....,"If we did not have great driver...Cindy Lowe, this would have been a complete loss...totally foggy...could not see anything...Catalina Expeditions needs to fill tourists in about conditions higher in the mountain top....nonetheless ...get Cindy as your bus driver...she needs to be in comedy...and yet...learned so much about Catalina was reciting my new found info in a local restaurant...would love to be up there on a nice day....the view must be amazing....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Southbaycouple
50,Pilot's perspective,"It's not often one gets to fly to an island airport on the top of the mountains. The scenery is breathtaking as you approach the island and enter the pattern. There were even some buffaloes just north of the field!The airport itself is definitely old school. No tower or any kind of aviation services such as fuel and maintenance. Be sure you have sufficient fuel for the trip back. The runway is in need of resurfacing which thankfully is in the plans for the near future. Just be advised that there is a $25 landing fee.On the airport, there is the runway cafe known for its world famous buffalo burgers. I actually found their cookies to be very tasty. The cafe also has a gift shop. Out front is the shuttle service to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boomzoom
50,A hidden treasure!,"We went there with our jeep tour - it was excellent! Service was on the slow side, due to limited space!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaMa-Rex
40,Spectacular scenery and drive,"We were shuttled from Avalon to the airport for a bike tour. Just the drive up was very impressive. It was much more thrilling, fun and beautiful to get out in the open air and ride bicycles back down the same route. I definitely recommend open air transport, open vehicle or bicycle to enjoy this spectacular ride an scenery. The airport is interesting, small and historic - walk around some and read the signs about the area and the airport history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/for2une
40,Nice stop when traveling the island interior.,"The airport in the sky is a pleasant lunch spot when traveling through Catalina Island's interior. The folks who work the counter prepare ones lunch and there are tables inside and outside the building to enjoy it. In addition to the lunch service, there is a small gift shop and museum. If you are on a tour of the interior, consider bringing a lunch with you because the lines at Airport in the Sky can be daunting. There are barbecues held at this location from time to time, so watch for those!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holymolyma

50,Neat place to visit even if you aren't a pilot!,"We did the Skyline tour which was a part of our hotel package and the airport in the sky was a stop on the tour. It was such a beautiful drive to get to the airport. It was a bit nerve racking, narrow roads and a bus with no power steering. But, if you can get past those things it was great fun. The airport in the sky is literally in the sky. You feel like you are on top of the world. We were about the clouds. The airport itself is tiny, for small planes. They have a nice gift shop and the cookies are SO GOOD! We had about 1/2 hour to walk around, soak in the views and relax.
