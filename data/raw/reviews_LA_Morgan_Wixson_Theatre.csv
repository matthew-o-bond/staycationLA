50,Drowsy Chaperone at the Morgan Wixson is a Delight!,"Just saw Drowsy Chaperone at the Morgan-Wixson and it was truly delightful. The cast is exceptionally talented and you're in store for a wonderful evening. There are only two weeks left so grab tickets while you can. I rarely go on line to do this type of review, but this production deserves it. Go, you won't be sorry! Support your local theater.",Felice P
50,Fun Time- Fantastic Show (Wedding Singer),"Love community Theaters and the passion and dedication of those that put their heart and soul into each performance. Small, intimate and not a bad seat in the house. I'm from NorCal and wanted to see some local entertainment- was not disappointed. Show was fantastically entertaining and fun and we all left in a great mood. I definitely recommend!",summersungrl

50,Great Theater in the heart of Santa Monica,"The Morgan-Wixson Theatre, located right on Pico Blvd. in Santa Monica is a wonderful venue. It is small, maybe holding a couple hundred people. The seats are comfortable and the place is well maintained. It appears to be run by some volunteers and paid employees. They are very welcoming and will assist you in any way needed. Park on the street if you can, but mind the signs. There is also free parking in a lot right near by. I brought my 12 year old grandson to see Little Shop of Horrors. He loved every minute as did I.At the Morgan you can buy snacks and sodas etc. but note you can only take water into the theater. The prices for everything are reasonable. We were comfortable, felt super safe and had a great time. You can leave the building during intermission if you want. The staff is very kind. Our tickets were at Will Call, as most are, and this wonderful woman with a clip board, went and got them for us--how sweet is that. She also talked to us during intermission to make sure all was going great. There were some volunteers that were so helpful in finding our seats and just being so welcoming. The staff is great.The musical, Little Shop of Horrors, itself was fabulous. Each performer was at the top of their game. This is LA so I am not shocked that a small theater has great actors, singers and dancers. This show was just as fun as one we have seen at very expensive theaters. The main 3 female singers for this show were just magic. All of the players were. I would tell you to go see it, but I think the run may be over (call them). They have a full schedule for other plays and musicals, some for adults, some for the whole family.I suggest this theater for anyone, be you a local or a visitor. You will love the professional cast, the great sound, the seats, the staff and you will not go broke. My grandson and I go to musicals all the time, he is a season pass holder to one of the bigger theaters in Hollywood. He loved this venue just as much as the bigger ones and the players were, as I said, great. We will be back. Have a great time.",elizabethlascheid
