40,A nice open air oasis in Hollywood to bring the kids.,"We took my granddaughter to the Pan Pacific Park on Beverly Blvd on a Sunday morning. It's a fairly large park for kids of all ages. While we were there kids were playing soccer, older kids were playing basketball. There were several courts going. Kids of all ages were playing here and having a good timeMy 20 month old grandaughter liked the swings and the elevated area where kids can run, use slides, climb and explore. There were a lot of children there with their parents.People were having picnics.The park has a security guard, rest rooms and free parking. Another thing I was impressed with was the ground all around the swings and slides was a cushioned material so the kids don't get hurt, if they fall down.It's an Impressive place in the heart of LA. Bring the kids so they can run and be kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
