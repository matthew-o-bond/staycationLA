50,Downtown delight,"The Grand Park in Downtown Los Angeles is well worth a visit, very popular with visitors and locals alike, especially vagrants. When we visited on a Sunday a cooking festival was happening, looked good. Remember to read the rules, photo attached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
40,Well done LA,"It’s great when a City keeps a space to relax. The Grand Park has lots of seating, is safe, a Starbucks and a water feature (illuminated at night).There are two quality play areas at both ends of the park (one slides etc the other a water zone). Park split into three levels and has security throughout.Some homeless people in the centre area (tent city) but they keep themselves to themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beas006
30,Nice City Hall,"Nice city hall building. A drive by and a few pictures would do it justice. Homeless tent city on edge of park. Lots of marginalized folks around, felt sad and a bit unsafe (although a big police station also there). Not a huge hit. A few nice pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live4Strength
40,Nice Spot To Chill Downtown,"I'm guessing people who work downtown use this multi-level park to take a break from the office or for lunch. The park has a great view of City Hall and it's set up like no other city park I've stumbled upon. It has multi levels that are divided by city streets. You walk up the stairs, cross the street and then walk into another section of the park. This continues until the top section where there's a nice fountain. Great spot for photos up there with the fountain and City Hall looming overhead. There's also a Metro station right between sections. Lots of green areas to sit. Not too crowded. Cool city park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
40,Take a BreaK,This is a good place to take a break from seeing downtown Los Angeles. It is a pleasant oasis with a water feature and bathrooms. It is near a number of sites. A good place to eat a take out lunch from a nearby deli or fast food place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ1912

50,Amazing place to hang out with family and for free entertainment,"For those who want to get wet in the heat, there's a great water area and a starbucks right next to it for the parents to hang out. For those who just want an enclosed safe space for kids, there's a nice playground for kids. For those who just want a big area to walk around, there's that too. Close to some nice restaurants and spots like grand central market, this is a great way to spend a few hours in downtown LA. Parking as always is the biggest problem where you have to pay for a nearby lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamles

40,Nice park downtown,"Although not a must visit, Grand Park is a nice park based in downtown LA that's worth a quick look at if you are in the area. The park is modern and well-landscaped, and has restrooms, so could be a good place for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
20,Empty on holiday,"Visited on Martin Luther King holiday, after 1pm. Plenty of open space, almost nobody around. Nice view of city hall and large fountain. Took six year old son to small playground close to city hall. Pink metal lawn furniture scattered throughout park. Because it was a holiday, I got free street parking nearby. Otherwise, the parking garage is expensive. I wouldn’t make a special trip to visit this park, unless there was an event going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Great cool off and break!,"Took a day trip with young kids to downtown LA yesterday and we were so grateful for the water fountain play area and splash pad for the kids. This was toward the end of our walking around and it gave them something to look forward to. The temperature was in the 80s in January!Definitely warm enough for water play. We had planned ahead and brought a total change of clothes for the kids which was a very good idea. There were very clean restrooms right next to the water play area and Starbucks (I was not expecting the RR to be so nice). Us adults sat in the shade having a Starbucks while the kids had a blast running around, playing in the water. After our time at Grand Park, we caught the metro subway back to Union Station where we then took the train home. If you bring kids to DTLA for a day trip on a warm day, try to work in a stop at Grand Park. It’s location is very close to Disney concert hall, the Broad and MOCA, even close to Grand Central Market and Angel’s flight. All these places are easily a day trip in itself, which is actually what we did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/applejanna
50,Beautiful city park,"Parks come in different shapes and sizes and this park is definitely one of my favorites for many reasons: beautiful scenic photo opportunities, a radiant colorful water fountain, seasonal social events such as summer dancing and movie screenings, fitness boot camps in the summer, día de Los muertos displays, concerts, holiday decor, and of course the New Year’s Eve countdown. Best of all is that most if not all of the events are free.Whether you’re coming here for an event, a stroll in the park, or just to get a great photo you are sure to enjoy the park. Grab a coffee at Starbucks and read a book from the community library. Parking for a fee is located directly below or you can try to find a meter on the street. Otherwise public transportation will take you here too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682cindy
50,Grand gathering spot in downtown Los Angeles,Grand gathering spot in downtown Los Angeles. Google it to see if special events are scheduled. Easy to access by public transit. Grand Central Market is nearby for food and beverages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Plain Vanilla Park with a Beautiful Fountain,"If it wasn't for the fountain at one end of the park, this park would not have to much to offer. It is flat on three or so levels...one must cross busy streets to get to each part. There is not much to see...there are a few displays and commerative plaques that were not that interesting. One area of the park was populated by homeless sleeping on the benches (LA has a serious homeless problem). The fountain is quite nice and beautiful (when it is running) and saves the park from being too plain. This park is located in the heart of downtown so if one is driving one should be aware that parking is very expensive there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
40,"Nice little park, with interesting events","Despite the name, the park is actually pretty small. Nice little fountain as well and a good place to relax. There were actually two events the day we stopped at the park and one, a promotional event by a health drink company, was pretty interesting with booths and a band.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld
50,"""Grand Park""",Such a great park to chill or take a yoga class during the day or to attend a special concert or event at night. Great lights and fountain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel4bourne
40,Heart of LA downtown,A very good place for relax and take a break. There's food truck selling food. Sometimes there's a small concert. Also there's Starbucks. You can sit at the grass or have your lunch at the park. Enjoy the fountain while drink coffee. No fee entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruv3
50,So lovely,This is something that is truly a standout in the heart of Los Angeles. The scene is meant to create a beautiful moment for tourists and residents so stop by and bring a camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
40,Little oasis!,"A small park in the heart of downtown, just across from the city hall and not far from Walt Disney concert hall and the cathedral. It populates during the lunch hours with people who come here for their break. In general it can be a great place to stop during a visit to downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
50,Face Lift,"It really bothers me that people talk about Grand Park as a new park. It was there since the 60s, but no one went there because it felt so cold and apart from the rest of LA (especially City Hall, only two blocks away). First came the subway station, and then they opened up the East end so it felt like it was part of the rest of the Civic Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapman62
40,Nice park,This is a nice park to stroll through and relax in if you need a break from walking. It runs between City Hall and the Music Center and it's the best way to walk between those sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875jl
50,The Grand Park,"Nice and Clean, looks like a lot of people enjoying the outdoor. Nice benches. Reminds me of the Boston Common but smaller. Neat little park with a Starbucks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456cristinaj
40,An oasis in the heart of the city,The main park in downtown Los Angeles is less about a pastoral setting than space to simply relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are many small gardens which are thematically based on regions of the world such as Africa and Asia. There is a large water play area where young children can cool off and even places to grab a quick beverage or bite. The Los Angeles city hall frames one end of the park (during weekdays you can access the observation deck) with the Dorothy Chandler pavilion at the other end. Definitely worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
40,Active Heart of the City,"We walked through this very active space while walking from The Broad to El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Park on a Saturday in early July. Some people assume the city center is quiet on the weekend, but it was very active this day. Tents and booths we set up opposite City Hall for a rally of some type. There are small stages, fountains, places to sit, places to eat, trees and grass. It is terraced so the Music Center end is higher than the City Hall end, allowing a bit of a view It had been many years since I had been in the area and I was surprised to see it so active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Pretty cool,Neat place to go unwind after checking into your hotel( which there are plenty in the area). A must visit place between city hall and dodger stadium. Good place for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Streetthiefprod
40,Memoriable Park,I went out to Grand Park when I was a child. there is a little bit change. The kids still play with water although they don't like it than my generation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetterWongP
50,A grand park indeed.,"This is a great urban space, tumbling down from Grand St to Spring St, from the Music Centre to City Hall.It's a wonderful place to relax and rest weary feet between sights to see, or for city workers to have lunch, or a break, or for families to enjoy time with the kids.On a hot summer's day (1 & 2 August 2016), we enjoyed an iced tea at Starbucks and watched the kids splash around in the splashpool, and office workers utilise the chairs under shadecloth.There are some lovely gardens featuring plants from all the continents, and an interesting display of historical flags, as well as sculptures.They used to say there was ""no there there"" in central Los Angeles. The urban regeneration around these parts prove that is no longer the case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,A Downtown Gem,"I love Grand Park. They have great events throughout the year. I can't think of a prettier fountain in all of Los Angeles, beautiful both day and night! It has some of the best views of downtown and especially, majestic City Hall. It usually isn't too crowded, very family friendly. And there is a Starbucks, too! Like most downtown spaces, parking can be a little tricky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBarnhart
50,4th of July - party! Nice park,"Visited Grand Park during the 4th of July block party. This was and 8 block party in the middle of downtown Los Angeles.The park expands for 4 block from the Music Center to city Hall. There are a lot of things going here. Animals area, history area, USA flag court, world peace monument, Christophe Columbus Monument, music door, great fountain and much more.Kids can get wet in the fountains, there are grassy areas and from the top you get some great views of city Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez

50,Beautiful Clean Park In Downtown LA,"We walked through the park on a Sunday afternoon while it was literally full of Los Angeles high school bands and dance performers! What a joy! Happy families, art, music and dance in a great Park. Grand Park should be part of any Downtown LA walking tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
50,Beautiful Place on the Outskirts of Downtown LA,This is one of my favorite places to visit when I am in Downtown LA. It's spectacular at night just like it is in the day time!The park is very clean and is walking distance from many restaurants. Must make a stop here because the fountain is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reader_girl932
50,Clean park within the city,"The park stretched from grand to spring it's about 30 minutes up and down. Great for lunch solo, with friends or kids. Well maintain also great for sport and rally spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugaylange
50,Perfect place to celebrate new year!!!,My friends and I got there around 9 PM on new years eve and we got a parking lot pretty fast. The park is amazing and there are a lot of food vendors in it. There are 3 stages in the park and one of them is like a outdoor night club. The countdown show is pretty cool too. It is indeed a great place to celebrate a new year!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJessica522
30,Good for Starbucks and Kids,"If you are in the area, this is a great place to take your kids for a mind melt. You'll find a small Starbucks inside the park where you can grab a refreshment to enjoy at the many bright pink tables, while your children splash around safely in the vast fountains! The water is less than half an inch deep and completely open. In fact, its encouraged that kids run around in the fountains!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
40,Green Space across from City Hall ...,"Grand Park is a nice area of green space downtown just across from City Hall and walking distance from the attractions over on Grand Avenue ( MOCA, Broad, Music Center & restaurants ). Walking it gives a super view & perspective of City Hall. ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Just a Park,"Was a little disappointed as it was pretty plain. Just went to check it out.... nice water fountains with some grassy areas... but all in all, was just OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markj4golf
50,Nice location with something for all,"Very nice location with lots of shopping, food, movies and trolley. Pretty waterfalls that dance with the music. There are a number of shops to include a three story Barnes and Noble, Sephora, Lululemon a Sprinkles cupcake shop, Cheesecake factory, sushi restaurant and other small eateries. There is a peaceful grassy area where people are able to get a free blanket and relax from walking around. The grassy area sits right in front of the dancing waterfalls. Kids were running around playing tag, blowing bubbles and eating ice cream. We followed the advice to park at the Galleria for free. We also took in a movie. Clean and spacious movie theater. Matinee was about $11 per person. Overall, very nice spot. Will definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marydZ48RF
40,Cool place in Downtown,Grand Park is also a big landmark in downtown. Very cool place where families are enjoying photography in green area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kausarwali
20,Only come here for an event,About the only reason to visit this place is during a major public event other then that its just a giant concrete walkway. It works for major events becuz of the nearby metro red line stops vs having to find parking in downtown LA. For 4th of july in past years they will shoot fireworks nearby and last year it was around the disney concert hall which made for fun fotos. Other times large outdoor concerts are held here. By the way there is little shade here so on hot days prepare,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
40,Kinda cool if you're in the neighborhood...,"Cool little park crossing streets and several elevation levels.Cools views day or night. Haven't seen it crowdedWater feature, stairs, some grass, some benches and tables, kid stuff at the bottomMostly for hanging out-- seems like lunch crowd from courts and surrounding buildingsFarmers market on Mondays, food trucks on Wed and Thurs, music every other Thurs.No reason to check it out unless you live/ work here or like me have jury duty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Fountain and flat grassy park,"It's actually quite nice, a large bit of green in the middle of the city, and they have spread chairs around. Was too cold to stay when we were there (about 15 Celsius, which any Californian will tell you is arctic weather), but a good walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Openfj0re
40,A lovely asset for Downtown LA,"The park is a lovely asset, that helps connect various points of interest in the downtown area: City Hall and Grand Avenue, with the performing arts facilities. The metro station makes all very accessible.I like the chairs that are freely available - sitting here with a cup of coffee or cool drink people-watching is a pleasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
40,Who knew? Great park in downtown in LA,"The development of the Grand Park area seems to be a newer project for LA and that might be why it's surprisingly uncrowded for what it has to offer. It doesn't have a ton, but the fountain at the top provides nice views and has an area where kids (and kids at heart) can get their feet wet. Lining the sides of the park are various botanical planting from different regions of the world. It's no botanical garden, but it's free, it's some of the only greenery around, and as things grow in the park should be even better. If you're doing a walking tour around some of the downtown sights and want a break from buildings, this is a great spot to spend a little time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseMW
