50,Day climb in Malibu,Had a great day of climbing with Roger and Millena at Point Dume. Milena answered a bunch of questions prior to my booking and made me feel comfortable making the reservation. Roger is a good teacher and offered many tips on becoming a better climber. Looking forward to climbing again with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briansF2579SF

50,"The best morning! Perfect, professional and patience","We did the half day climbing.Roger and Milena were wonderfull guides! My boyfriend climbed before, I never did and we were both so satisfied! It already started with the mailcontact. Milena took the time to awnser all my questions. The area where we climbed was stunningly beautiful. I felt so confident because of their perfect guiding and we did 5 beautiful climbes also with nice views. We had the best morning! I would do this over and over again with these lovely and professional people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488jenniferr
50,Best rock climb experience in Los Angeles (malibu),"Roger is a great coach, he and his team are very professional and friendly. They are not only patient but also helped me feel confident all the way to the top. They are excellent with kids too. I notice that safety was a priority and the equipments were new. It was a great experience in an amazing place. Highly recommend :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857andreiaf
