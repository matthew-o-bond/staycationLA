10,Horrible customer service,"If you want to save yourself a headache DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE, they are pigs! They were hoping for me to give them 3 to 4 thousand dollars for fixing my sunroof that they purposely broke to make more money off of me. Itâ€™s sad to say that i was trying to trust my local Galpin dealerships, NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanettita
40,Car collection is great......,We went only to see the car collection. While the collection is not huge there is a great variety of classic to hot rods. In a busy area for sure so plan to go early and finish before rush hour!! Nice staff at collection and store.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveVWV
50,Great tour by a knowledgeable guide,"My son and I visited and had a great tour by Chuck, the museum curator. He knew a lot about each car, but wasn't showy about it. Instead, he asked my son questions to get him more involved in the tour. It was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmmarley

50,Thank you Mr.Allison!,"My dad is a car nut. Since we were visiting California I found out about the Galpin Auto Sports Museum and decided to take my dad on the last day. Mr. Allison was so kind and very informative and made our visit so enjoyable. It was such a highlight for my dad. They have a variety of cars there and something for everyone. There were cars from Ed Roth, items from Von Dutch, there were super rare cars, it really had something for everyone. Mr. Allison told us to go check out the Horseless Carriage Restaurant and it did not disappoint. Mr.Allison went above and beyond to ensure my dad and I had a great time. We look forward to coming back again. Thank you to everyone at Galpin. That meant the world to my dad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley

50,Fantastic Museum,We came here on a recommendation and wow what a place. Chuck was our guide and he did a fantastic job. He kept us entertained for more than 3 hours. So much to see. Very pleased we were able to get a private tour through this collection. If you in the area I would highly recommend you book a tour!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roxy1932
40,Must See for Race Car Fans,"Came here for Bob, not as much interest to me.They do have some unusual cars I like. See my pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanettaS26
50,FABULOUS!!,"We were told by George Barris to come and visit Mike at the museum. We were unaware that you needed an appointment to tour the collection. However when we tried to enter and the door was locked, Mike came walking up, greeted us and then asked Chuck to give us a guided tour. What a GREAT experience it was to see all these beautiful cars and also have all the historical information given to us by such an experienced, pleasant and knowledgeable man as Chuck. Thank you Mike and Chuck for all your hospitality!!!Conclusion: If you would like to visit this wonderful collection, please call first and make an appointment so they can be sure and accommodate your visit. We were very lucky.Oh...and the apparel shop has all the goodies you would ever want.Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneD306
50,Shhhhh - Don't Tell Anyone!,"A best kept secret (sorry Galpin for blowing the lid off this one) - that will make you want to march right next door to Galpin and buy something souped up and shiny (I did that's how I heard about this showroom). Chuck (our tour guide/docent and all around nice guy) knew everything about everything and couldn't have been more kind as he walked us by (at a safe distance of course) some of the most amazing cars you will ever see. But, don't tell anyone - this is one attraction that should probably remain a well guarded secret.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
