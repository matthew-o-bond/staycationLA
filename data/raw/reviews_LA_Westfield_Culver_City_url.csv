40,Terrific local mall with plenty of good food options,"Westfield Culver City (formerly Fox Hills Mall) is an indoor mall that seems to have an emphasis on food. It has most of the standard mall chain stores, with about every shoe store you can think of.

There is an attached multi-level parking structure that has plenty of parking for all but the busiest Christmas shopping days.What distinguishes this mall from some others are the food options. There is a spacious food court on the third floor with most types of cuisine. Of particular note are a lot of Asian food options, including a Vietnamese, Mongolian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese places. Elsewhere in the mall are BJ's Brewhouse, Lucille's BBQ, Olive Garden, Wokano (Asian sit-down place + bar + karaoke), Qdoba, Five Guys, etc.The mall is generally safe and, having been renovated in the past 5-6 years, looks modern and inviting.

50,Modern with great stores!,"This is a really nice, updated mall with lots of great stores. Everything that you'd want for a good day of shopping. The food court has a wide variety of really good food counters. Really enjoyed Mongol Grill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurieb112
40,Great mall.,Nice sized mall with plenty of choices.Food hall was great with a large selection to choose from.Seated areas for weary shoppers were in abundance and very welcome during our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9045PEdenisew
40,Nice mall,"I arrived late in the evening so I was not able to experience the mall in its entirety. However, the parts that I did see were nice. The forever 21 store was huge. You don't have to worry about paying to park at this mall. The trouble is with finding a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdoug19
40,Decent mall,The mall seems dated and not up with the current times. Lots of carts and smaller stores and not much in terms of services beyond haircuts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bostonsig
50,The best mall,It's the best mall There are a verity of shops with good bargains and the restaurants are good to and it's close to LAX airport and there's a lot of hotels around it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tmak6
50,Food court,Great different choices. I was able to go with friends and we all got different things that we wanted and still were able to enjoy each other's company.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scardenas3
40,Good shopping center in LAX area,"Good shopping center in LAX area. 3 floors among them one is only for restaurants. Try the Corean and the Japan restaurants. Really good. You find everything in the center: Macy's, Hollister, HM etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fiftop
30,Free parking,I guess not much to say about westfield mall because i only been there for one and half hour . There is good resturent in the dinning area i recommend goin there it is kabob resuterent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelldone
50,A little bit of everything,"Let me talk about their food court and other eateries. It's like an international affair. You have your Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, American, Mediterranean, you have a little bit of everything and that's the food court alone. Their restaurants and in the fall of 2016 they are adding more restaurants as well as a Trader Joes grocery store.The shops here are also great. I'm a small boutique store type of person so I can't comment on the Macy's or JC Penny's that's there. The boutique stores are great. Oh this mall also has a Target and a Best Buy if you need stores like that. I feel Westfield Culver City aka. Fox Hills Mall to the locals will be your one stop shopping destination. I live in the area and I'm there at least a few times in the month to shop, eat, or get a chair massage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharlambaker
40,Great shopping and food court,"From Forever 21, H&M, JC Penny, ALDO, Target, Bath&Body works, Westfield has a great selection of stores. It's also compact enough that you can circle the entire mall and not get too lost, the signs are clear enough. The best part - there's free WiFi and an awesome food court with an array of options from American fast food to Japanese sushi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onnaedoo
50,Dot Saigon Vietamese,Unfortunately because the restaurant is a food court place inside this mall it wouldn't come up. So hopefully this review will get out. One of the best Vietnamese cold noodle salads I have ever had. The mushroom one is most delicious! I highly recommend finding this spot on the upstairs food court in Westfield Mall. It won't disappoint. The owners also have a food truck that appeared on the Food Truck Wars I think 2014. So amazing. There Pho was very good too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiZ_12
30,Medium,"A classic mall, normal don't expext nothim more than average , parking isint so bad ... But the mall directory should have some improvement .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guilherme_Ketzer
40,Lovely renovation and upgrade,"Since Westfield took over this mall in Southern Culver City, they have done a wonderful job of upgrading the stores and restaurants. The food court is terrific and is very busy at lunch and on weekends. The Macy's has a wonderful selection of items and is well stocked. The mall is open and bright and the Target is also well stocked. There are many restaurant options including a Five Guys burger joint. Good store selection, too. There is a small play space and and a train ride for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracyd310
30,Who misses malls?,"Solid Mall, parking can seem tight at typical busy times but most park in the front Lot so go around and try another. The food court has a solid selection and many actually Have A ratings from board of health which is nice. Xtreme Boardshop is a solid skate shop next door to vans and worth a stop in for surf/skate style clothes or Skateboards and Longboards themselves.The only thing that strikes my East coast body weird is no Movie Theatre in the mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reverantone
40,Great shopping under one roof,"Nice & convinient mall for all your shopping needs. Also has free wifi! The shops selection could be better, though. A few popular brands are noticeably absent here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzielicious
40,Clean and Spacious,"t’s a large mall with three large department stores, Macy’s, Penny’s, and Target. There are over 30 places to get something to eat in this mall. We ate at Five Guys. There is also a Best Buy where I spent most of the money this evening. The mall is very clean and bright. Most anything you could want could be purchased here. There are three stories of stores and eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donb712
30,Not the best of the westfields,Been to lots of better Westfields malls around the state. We went here to go to dinner and went to Olive Garden. The shop selection is pretty good but missing a few personal favourites like Abercrombie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrylgreen
30,Shopping near the airportq,"This is a great shopping centre located near the airport .. They have Macy's, JC Penney, Target, Sephora, Guess and other specialty shops. If you are looking for shopping close to the airport this is a great location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lgberriman
40,Well organized shopping mall,"The property is in excellent condition, restrooms are clean and there are many different restaurants. Also the garage was large and free. There is large selection of shops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tuoppi52
40,Really nice mall,Came here last week while on vacation with some friends as something to do on a rainy evening. We didn't do much but walk around the mall. The selection was great and the mall was huge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegrizz88
30,Good Mall - decent food,Great food court but the rest is normal mall restaurants. Shops tend to the very young market. And parking is just ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
40,An Excellent Mall,"Westfield is close to my home and my wife and I go there often, to shop and eat. Macy's and J.C. Penny have excellent bargains. The Food Court is good. Since it was remodeled, it is a pleasant place to be. An excellent place for those leaving the country to shop since it is very close to LAX.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilbert2015
40,It'll always be Fox Hills Mall to me,"Westfield did an outstanding job on revitalizing and creating a brand new shopping and dining experience here. I've patronized this mall for decades ... watched the decline and renovation and I like what they've done here. The expanded indoor food court, restaurants and variety of stores has completely face lifted this once declining mall. I enjoy spending time here. BJ's is a welcome addition as is Target and Best Buy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILuv2Mingle
50,This is a good shopping mall. Complete and convenient.,"I really like it because it has a macys, nordstrom rack and a target and you do not have to walk a lot to go between these big stores like in other shopping malls. The food court is ok and it also has other restaurants to choose from which are better than the food court.I do recommend this shopping center.Public transportation to and from the mall is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoreniaA
50,Newly design mall!,Really liked the mall since it has been upgraded and it is a pleasure to shop and eat there. Several popular stores for young and elderly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Britt333777
40,Good Malll,"Very pleasant mall with a fine selection of stores, especially liked Target for their helpful staff. Incredibly poor signage for exit to parking, I guess they want to trap you in the mall as long as possible whilst they drain your pocket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milktray
40,"easy in and out parking,quality stores and friendly security staff","Best buy and Macys for gifts enjoyable experience .no hassle, quick in and out. Crowded but non stressful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roym222
40,Great Mall To Shop At,"This is a great mall for shopping. It is the closest one to LAX airport and the best one in the area. With anchor stores Macy's, JC Penney, Target, Best Buy, Gold's Gym and great restaurants Olive Garden, BJ's Brewery and Lucille's Bar-be-que balances it off after a great shopping trip. There's a great food court and other eateries in the mall. The mall is also surrounded by great hotels and not that far from Marina del Rey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeane141
40,Very Nice Shopping Mall,"Wide varieties of shops and restaurants, target super market which was an advantage, I used to go there everyday after my exams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198asmaag
50,Very nice shopping center!,"This shopping center has it all! Movie theater, restaurants, food court, shops, and a little play area for the kids! We end up here every visit! You do have to pay for parking and be sure to remember where you parked. You can get parking validated at the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TXRanney76
20,Lost in the Maze,This is the weirdest designed mall I've ever been in. There is so much wasted space and inefficient circulation routes. Very hard to navigate your way around. Best Buy's location is the worst. You feel like you are in a labyrinth trying to get there and going through a tunnel to get into the store. Makes no sense. No bookstore or theaters either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickr847
40,Great variety of stores,"I visited on a Friday around lunch time. It was extremely quiet inside the mall. Not many customers walking around at all. There was a really good variety of stores with many of the larger department stores. The food court was ordinary compared to our Westfields in Sydney. The food choices scared us, with only Burger King as the safe option for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brijess
40,"Nice mall, good location","This is a nice mall, completely indoors. Nice line up of stores, plenty of sales on 2 weeks before lead up to 4th July. Parking was easy. But my sat nav had problems finding this originally, as there is another mall beginning with West... in Culver City, but that has Century in the name. Spent an hour in traffic on the freeways before I realised our error. Great that Target was part of the main centre, which was a real bonus in terms of access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dublinlocal
40,Popcornopolis,"Ok! This is the main reason I came to this mall. Well after eating the white cheddar popcorn at home, it's to salty for me. I also tried the cheddar cheese and it was not a favorite. The only one that passed my taste buds is nearly naked. Then I shopped at hallmark, got a orange supreme (squeezed juice) from Jamba juice, and then stopped at Baskin Robbins and they had no sugar added brownie Sundae. ( I was delighted to try it- very good). it's not the best mall that I have visited and some stores are on the outside of the mall, but not a bad stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
40,Kinda outdoor mall,"The mall is pretty big. It has both outdoors and indoors features, which is different from Westfield malls that I've been to. It was pouring rain when we went, which was not that great as there is no undercover walkways for you to walk around. So, we end up dashing here and there.Big stores like Macy have a few floors to go through, which is great to keep out of the rain. Parking can be a problem has it was quite busy when we went there, but it is free. I think you can walk around with your pets. We saw that Westfield provide free ""dog biscuits"" as treats for owners to use them. Perhaps, our experience would have been better if it wasn't raining and that we could easily find a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikeSweet
