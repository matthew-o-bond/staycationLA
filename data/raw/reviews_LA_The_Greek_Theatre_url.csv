50,Hot August Night,We first heard of the theatre while discovering and enjoying Neil Diamond's Hot August Night double album. It was recorded here as one of ten full capacity concerts in 1972.It was interesting to discover that the theatre was built by the philanthropy of Griffith J Griffith and first performance was in June 1931.,permia
10,Gives Greeks a bad name,"Went to see Ringo Starr....took me 1 hour just to go about a mile because the road to the entrance is very narrow .They advertised paid parking near the depot...for which I paid 15.00..but they never gave an address...I kept going only to realize that this was mseveral miles away. Then I had to pay them again 30.00 to park in a field. Stage is too small, acoustics are horrible...will never go there again.",importedinteriors
50,Rocketman!,"Excellent facility. Great visuals and sound, considering it's 5800+ people outdoors. Two items of caution: 1) As it's outdoors, make sure you're going to be dressed warmly enough. 2) Acess is basically via one mainly residential road only so make sure you give yourself PLENTY of time to get there.",Tony S
50,A great outdoor amphitheater to see a concert,"We were fortunate to be in Los Angeles and catch Luke Combs in concert at The Greek Theater. This was our first visit/concert here and we were very pleased with this wonderful venue. Our aisle seats were in Section BR which we felt provided a good view of the stage (good value for price paid). For a relaxing night out we arrived an hour early; less traffic and able to walk around the area. Purchased the $30 parking pass online (costs more if not purchased online ahead of time) and was able to park in Lot B near the entrance road and a very short walk to the amphitheater. Despite a seating capacity just under 6,000 it feels much larger when you’re waiting in line for the restroom or the food/beverage area! Plan accordingly! While it may not be a surprise to some, Firestone Walker 805 beer is $16 for a 24 oz. can. Overall, a special place to watch a concert under the stars!",Keystone_Traveler
50,"Fabulous, open air, well managed LA concert venue","This concert venue has some popular music history behind it which was one of the reasons that I wanted to visit it. It did not disappoint. Its non ""stadium"" size, ambience and general layout and amenities matched my expectations 100%. Being in an open air amphitheatre, the atmosphere was perfect for the combined classic rock and classic country music concert. Access to drinks and food was good and no effort for the particular concert that I attended. The only issue was Uber after the concert. Just not available on the evening we were there and we were stranded in the ride share area for over 1 hour. By flicking to another ride share app we managed to get a lift back to downtown LA. So just be careful after the concert and have more than one ride app on your phone.",Alan K
50,great concert venue,make sure to research and buy parking after getting concert tix. the Greek is essentially impossible to get to on a Friday night unless you are nearby.,Stewart W
20,Security was terrible and keeping people from walking up to the stage,"Super disappointing. We spent quite a bit of money to have second row in the middle section tickets a few weeks ago for Mark Knopfler and half way through a lot of people crowded the stage front of the stage in front of us. They came from all sides of the theatre. Security tried to get them to sit back down. It was a mess. They got most then the next song and more started coming up. We couldn't even get up there if we tried because the aisles were blocked. So many rude people telling security where to go, screaming they got there first etc. Upset front row people and we were upset too. It was obnoxious and uncalled for. Very distracting to the band as well. Attached is a picture from 2nd row of my view. Not happy and will not return.The sound was great, no service to get an Uber after and bathrooms clean.",lovept
50,Great venue!!,"This was my first time at the Greek and I had a blast. I paid for parking at lot C out of precaution due to previous traffic jam situations at other venues. Honestly, it wasn’t necessary but it was a breeze to get out of the venue. The food inside was delicious and not your typical dried out hot dogs and nachos. The beer selection was ample and there wasn’t issues with huge lines since there were plenty of opened queues on all sides of the venue. I really enjoyed my experience.",SageAdvice24
50,Awesome venue,"I am a music photographer who traveled the world and have photographed more than 5000 concerts all over the world - just google Guido Karp or check wikipedia if you care to learn more. The Greek Theatre is one of the finest venues I have come across, no matter if out of the view as the one who works there or someone attending a concert.Just been there with Mark Knopfler - everyone had an amazing time.",GuidoKarp
50,Concert,One of the best venues to see a concert under the stars ⭐️ In Los Angeles. Great sound system and great experience overall.,Veronica A
40,First time visiting venue,We enjoyed the show and the theater was very nice. Our only complaint is the parking and its cost. We paid $30 to park at the top of wooded area that had no lighting at the end of the show and running sprinklers. Again show waas excellent. Parkong location and cost ridiculus.,FellowTraveler229137
50,One of the best,"This has been on our bucket list and we finally got there for an Avett Brothers concert. We had high expectations and they were exceeded!Sound was fantastic, views were amazing, bathrooms were plentiful and clean, and yes, it gets chilly at night, even in the summer....A few tips: 1. if you can afford it, the $75 parking was worth it. We had a long drive afterwards (and we were still on east coast time), so we walked out of the gate, our car was only a few steps away, and we probably saved 45 minutes in traffic by doing this. Given LA is all traffic all the time, this trade off seemed worth it for us, so we splurged and felt it was worth it.2. The little grove area to the right of the entrance is such a chill place to just hang and people watch before the show.3. While we were excited to get 2nd row behind the pit, we realized during the show that the incline of the actual seats doesn’t really start well til the 3rd or 4th rows. If you’re shorter, like my wife and kids, then you may want to get 4th row or further back.4. The Grove isn’t too far away and offers some good dinner spots for pre-show.5. It gets dark fairly early, and then you start to lose some of the effect of the cool scenery. Take a walk towards the top before the show to get the full effect and take some pics.In summary, if you’re a music fan, like us, definitely get to the Greek Theater at some point!",NJLuv2Travel13
50,Great venue,"Beautiful spot to see a concert and the sound is spectacular. Parking is not fun, though. I suggest parking below Los Feliz and walking to the Greek. It's a good 1/2-mile but definitely worth it and will save you hours trying to get out of the parking lot.",Fearless24390538997
50,Concert Venue Gem!!!,Recently attended The Greek Theatre to watch/listen to a number of the 1980’s “One Hit Wonders.” The Greek never disappoints as the sound and sight lines are awesome. The parking can be challenging.... do yourself a favor and park off-site and take a shuttle in.,1WorldTraveler9
50,JRAD at the Greek Theatre,The band rocked it and I hope you bring them back next year as I'd definitely make the trek from Colorado to see them there. Amazing venue and setting. Weather was perfect. The pit was not overcrowded which was a welcome change from other venues where the floor or standing room area is oversold and packed like sardines. The food was only okay. The sweet potato tots were soggy and not crispy and I ended up throwing them away. Bathrooms were clean and easily accessible.Parking was pretty expensive (I think it was $45). Seems a bit excessive.,0504sally
50,Concerts at The Greek,"We love this place. Parking is generally a breeze both in and out. They provide an outdoor restroom option-especially useful if you bring your picnic basket with some nice drink for before or after the show. No need to hurry out either. But don’t walk to the parking lots alone -coyotes abound. They will generally run away from you so just a heads up! Getting into the theatre is a bit slow as they search and seize but after that, it’s a pretty well oiled engine. They are a bit more strict but it’s still a visit worth the trip.",marge b
50,Things to know before you go.,"I prepaid parking online for lot A, B, or H (cash only if you pay on the day). Lot A is the first lot as you go up Vermont. Lot B is the closest to the theatre entrance and was easy to get out of even stack parked (we arrived at 5:15 pm for a 8pm show), lot H is on the other side of the theatre farther up the hill. Parking at the Griffith Park pony rides and taking the shuttle is cheaper but you can't bring stuff into the theatre so be prepared. Picnic tables (20+) are available near and across from lot B but bring a table cover. Across the street is Franklin's Cafe & Market where you can purchase beer, wine, coffee, snacks and sit at a lovely outdoor patio area. Street vendors cook and sell hotdogs if you're brave enough to buy from them. I prefer to park at the venue so I can bring my meal etc., take stuff back to the car and then enter the venue. Or you can bring chairs and sit near your car if you're parked on the grass. While we sat at the tables the shuttle bus drop off was about 30 minutes apart. Keep in mind nothing but a sealed bottle of water is permitted in the theatre (besides a purse), no SLR cameras allowed. Bring a cushion if you need one, no cushion rentals. The theatre is great because its not too big so most every seat is a good one. There is no cell service in the area. Bathrooms are huge and don't take long.",Rhondalette
50,Best night of my life!,"Our first time there and certainly not our last! One of the best concert experiences ever! Admittingly we had second row seats in the pit, but the venue is so small ( less than 6K seats in the house) I cannot imagine any seat feeling distant. Half way through the event i began to recognize other patrons as we truly were a small group of less than 6K. Think about that...many concert venues are 10s of 1000s more people/seats! Such a fantastic venue! Looking forward to enjoying more of our favorite artists there!",Sharon
50,Iconic concert venue,"This is a great place to see a concert in Los Angeles. Small enough so that nearly anywhere you sit provides a decent location, especially compared to much larger arenas in Southern California. Do plan your transportation and parking in advance as the situation can get tight here. At our recent visit, we took a Lyft in and out of the place. Wine is cheaper than beer - but my order of wine came in a plastic cup filled nearly to the top, so avoiding spillage was my concern walking it back to my seat. Sound level, at least at the concert I attended, was better than at some Hollywood Bowl concerts I've attended - bringing ear plugs is your call - I usually opt to do so.",The Places Where We Go Podcast
50,Great venue for outdoor music,This is a superb setting to watch music outdoors. Thw setting is also matched by tge atmosphere which made for a memoravle performance. Great views and plenty of space to get up and do what you want to along with cup holders. The venue has a very good shuttle service in place to the metro along with good car parking. The one thing that was not good was the price of food and drink. I really did think this was a rip off was a couple of hundred dollars we did not expect to spend especially the alcohol prices.,joep735
50,Another great L.A. invention,"Another great L.A. invention, the Greek Theatre offers a mini-Hollywood Bowl experience – this time for Rodrigo y Gabriela. The concert atmosphere was fantastic, the setup overall very well organized. Except that the food opportunities are too limited. At the Mercedes Lounge, having a single person completing all the orders one by one was very nice of her (cannot blame her for the faulty setup), but highly inefficient and an insult to the customers who had to wait more than 45 min for the order to be completed…Tip: Park at a distance, consider shuttle bus or walk …(Originally posted by me on yelp).",AMKaiser
50,"So intimate, beautiful weather and great crowd!",Saw Rodrigo y Gabriela here. Phenomenal venue. Want to go back today! Highly suggest this intimate setting. Don't miss your chance!,hhunter2018

50,Steve martin and Martin Short,"Joined friends to see Steve Martin and Martin Short's show (see separate review) at the Greek Theatre in LA. This venue is well-organized and cool. We ate at a local restaurant but it is clear that many folks ate there, arriving early and partaking of one of the many food choices available there---lots of tables, areas to sit etc. The security folks were friendly and efficient, it took absolutely no time to get through. Traffic attendants all the way up to the theatre got people where they needed without backing traffic up. I do pity the [rich] folks who live there given access to their homes is impaired from May through October due to their schedule.Tickets are not inexpensive nor is parking that ranges from $30 to $75---however, the $75 parking (which I got) puts you in the middle of Vermont Ave, is right by the theatre and allows you to enter/exit easily. Exiting the theatre, well be patient---you have 5 to 6,000 folks leaving and it is like an LA freeway during rush hour. Also, maybe hit the restroom (if needed) a bit before the end of the show given it gets VERY busy right after the show ends. Bottom line on exiting, just wear your patience.All-in-all, a very nice experience worth it for more special events.",docgeo70
10,Billie Eilish,"Concert was great and kids loved it but have to say as someone who has been to concert venues worldwide they s place is shocking, no info on what can be taken into venue and then close the bar 40 mins into main act, sorry in Europe that would constitute a riot.

50,Wonderful concert venue,"We visited the Greek for the first time and it was a great place to attend a concert.Parking was a bit of a mess as you’re in the same traffic as the cars trying to go to the Griffith Observatory which since La La Land has been stupid crazy nutty crowded. It’s also expensive parking - $30!However, the Greek is intimate and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. They have two Jumbotrons that show everything on stage so even when your vision is blocked by people standing at a concert, you still see everything. The sound system is very good even though you’re under the stars.",Mako159
50,Super clean outdoor venue,"The Greek Theater is the best outdoor venue I've been to! It's super clean and the people working there during concerts are absolutely awesome. There are multiple food and drink options and they have the cleanest bathrooms I've ever used at a concert. If you're thinking about catching a show there, do it!",Sarah P
40,Impressive outdoor theatre,"First time visit to The Greek. Impressive & much more intimate than the Hollywood Bowl. I'd love to rate The Greek 5 stars although unfortunately forced myself to rate it 4 instead of 3 stars, reason being the Hollywood Bowl has them bowled over concerning shuttle service. I waited a solid hour (along with hundreds of others) for the shuttle to the parking area. I have to say I find this an unacceptable way to treat their tired guests whom just want to get home.",Michael H

Good parking (for L.A.), large clean restrooms, qe are at the MB lounge and the food was pretty good for concert food. Drinks are a bit pricey but that is to be expected. We were in section C center and had good seats, looks like all seats would be pretty good for a concert.",Edster71

50,Great concert venue,"this ranks up with the Red Rock outside of Denver as one of the best venues to see a concert. Perfectly nestled in the hills of LA it was just a great place to be on a great Saturday evening. We saw Ringo Starr and what a great concert. the sound was awesome. Great facilities prior to the show and at the will call we were given VIP pass which was a pleasant surprise. Only drawback is parking is tricky and a bit high in cost. Whenever i visit again I will be looking to see a concert again, take me to the Greek!",avgjoey
50,"Perfect size, great setting","Beautiful setting for concerts, right outside LA. You can get there in many ways. I recommend parking by a Park and Ride station and just take one of the shuttles there; a lot less hassle.

You can't find a better place to attend a concert with an eclectic crowd and beautiful surroundings...",AntoineB1965
50,One of my favorite places to see a concert!!,The Greek Theater is one of my favorite places to see a concert!! I have been going here for a long while and love all the upgrades to the concert arena.,Richard K
50,Ringo Starrs All Starr Band fabulous show and venue,"This was my first visit to the iconic Greek and was so looking forward to it. The gates opened just after 6.30 as scheduled. Security through the gates was quick and efficient. Plenty of stalls offering merchandise, food and drinks and no long queues. Comfortable seats within the theatre. We were in block B row S and we had a decent view of the stage and the artists were easy to pick out. Pretty impressed with the number of toilets available for both ladies and gents, no long queues. We had pre booked the Pony Train shuttle which worked a treat. No queuing for the bus to go to the Greek but on the return home, we had to wait about 40mins in our queue until an available bus came, which I thought was acceptable as we didn’t leave the Theater well after the majority of folk had left, leaving us near the back of the line",Bordersgeezer
30,A Great Place To See a Show,"We went to see Alice Cooper and initially were very please with our seats. The one problem we encounter was we were in a section where everyone was seated...except for the two 6'2"" guys in front of us who chose to stand. Neither our family nor the family with kids in the row behind us could see even when we stood. We eventually left our seats and moved to the aisle to watch the show but were told by ushers we could not be there. They directed us to a spot where we could stand but the seats were completely obstructed. We eventually found empty seats where we could see (without the help of staff) and enjoyed the rest of the show. A great place to see a concert. But be aware that if people stand in front of you, you are on your own to try to find a way to see the stage.",Eric L
50,Perfect Venue and seriously worth a visit.,"Were lucky enough to find Alice Cooper was playing at the Greek Theater during our holiday and booked tickets from home in the UK. Arrived and quickly picked up our tickets via Will Call. Amazing venue, excellent seats and view and to enjoy Alice Cooper (who we have seen many times in the UK) at an outside venue in LA was fantastic. Plenty of food/drink options and thoroughly enjoyed the margarita bar with very entertaining bar staff!",caz389
50,Brandi Carlile Concert at the Greek,"Wow what a great night. Parking was plentiful as long as you had cash (there Is an ATM near 'will call'. It will charge you $4 and then your institution will charge another amount. Mine charged $2.95). Seriously bring cash with you for the fees. I looked at the seating and Sadi, wow, not a bad seat in the house. The bad was flawless, the sound was amazing and the screens wee very clear. I really want to go and explore Griffith Park now.",kristinaquinones
50,Fantastic outdoor theater in Griffith park,"The Greek is a fantastic outdoor theater in Griffith park. The sound is amazing, the views are terrific, and the setting is very special. We were in section B, which is in the lower middle part and gives a good overview of the stage while you can still see the artists in detail. Sitting in the front section would actually be less attractive as you miss the overview and the feel of the setting.We bought the 25 dollar parking in advance so we could avoid stacked parking. This gives access to lot A/B/H which are all very close to the theater (3-5 minute walk). The way up though the park is one long traffic jam but it didn't take as long as we feared after reading all the complaints about parking.We left right after the encore and took the Observatory route down which offered magnificent views of LA by night. Took us 10 minutes. Many people left before the encore which was not really necessary. And they missed Charlie Puth's encore, See you again...!The food and drinks were indeed expensive but you cannot bring your own. Still, in comparison to the tickets these prices were ok.All in all, a must see if you visit LA!",Matthijs K
30,Freestyle Fest,We went here for the freestyle festival. Parking is 25 dollars you have to park your car in the lawn. About a five minute walk to the theatre. The theatre is nice the pit does have chairs I wish I knew that. We left before the last act so we were able to beat the traffic. The food was pricey so we passed. There are alternate ways of transportation there but for out of towners it's confusing. Unfortunately the concert was pretty boring mostly people I never heard of just was there to see Salt N Pepa.,Rich M
40,Great concert venue,Brilliant venue for concerts and you can get a great view from pretty much any seat. We came on the night and bought tickets from the box office but we still had a good view of the main stage. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the terrible parking. We parked quite far out and it still cost us $25 and the queues to get in are horrendous so I'd definitely recommend coming at least an hour before it starts. Getting in and out there are huge queues and if we come again I'd probably get an uber which seemed like a much more hassle free option.,vickygr282
50,Awesome venue in the woods,"Right in the middle of Los Angeles is an outdoor amphitheatre, in the woods, in a park. The place is gorgeous, the sound was amazing, and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. I reserved a parking spot ahead of time online, which I highly recommend as you save $5 and can park closer. Even so, the traffic was awful getting into the park, so give yourself plenty of time. Food and drink very average and high prices, as expected. The staff were friendly and professional, no complaints there. Huge bathrooms with plenty of stalls.",Partera60

50,Love this venue!,"I love the intimate feel of this venue. It's easy enough to get in and out of the venue with a little forethought. Parking in Lot H is non-stacked and was $25. We walked out during the last song and beat the rush - were able to drive right out with no traffic. We could still hear the song on the way to the car. Totally worth leaving a little early to avoid traffic.Sat in Section B Row F and was totally happy with the view. Bathrooms were right there - clean and no line if you don't go during intermission/rush times.There are several options for bars, beer carts, and concessions. Drinks/prices were typical for a concert venue. Chicken fingers were surprisingly very good.I really need to get to the Greek more often.",Christie I
50,A FAVORITE VENUE,I love this venue. It's clean and there really isn't a bad seat. The restrooms are accessible and the food/drink prices are reasonable. There are a lot of staff to assist you. The music quality is excellent as well. There are public bus stops amd an Uber Lot across the street. I highly recommend The Greek Theater,Robyn P
10,A threatre not a dance club,"This venue would not have a bad seat in the place if people would do just that, sit.Instead, they all stand and dance at their seats forming a wall to all behind them. Biggest waste of money if seating is not enforced. This used to be a fine venue, may as well have been at a soccer match. Los Angeles has become somewhat of a 3rd world country.",alicemU7341FU
40,LA's other outdoor venue,"More intimate than the Bowl, this is great outdoor venue for spring/summer concerts with a great variety of artists. The Dash shuttle gives access from the Vermont/Sunset Red Line station and tuns late on concert nights to take you back.. Got there from the west side in less than an hour on a Friday evening.",Berrywin
50,First Concert at this venue- WOW,"Arrived early from shuttle by Pony Ride park and it was beautiful. Much smaller venue that I was anticipating with not a bad seat in the house. Saw Sugarland Concert and it was amazing. View and acoustics were perfect, seats comfortable, bathroom lines short and plenty of food/drink options. Will be going back many times.",549deanv
40,Beautiful Outdoor Setting / Expensive Parking,"The Greek Theatre provides one of the most beautiful settings for concerts with the stage surrounded by natural hillsides. Located within Griffith Park & adjacent to a residential area, the Greek has no traffic noise like the Hollywood Bowl! NOTE: Because of the Theatre's location, performances usually START ON TIME unlike most venues. NOTE: Bring a jacket as most nights are cool. NOTE: Parking is expensive. A parking alternative is to park south of Los Feliz Blvd. and take the DASH bus on Hillhurst & Franklin for only 50 cents per person!",weRtheWorld2016
50,Yanni concert,"We were there this evening for Yanni’s 25th anniversary tour of Acropolis..... and it was a fabulous one with an awesome venue, the Greek Theatre in Griffith Park. This venue is really wonderful to go in the summer months as it is a open air place with beautiful sound all around due to the design of the backdrop to keep the music all within the park. It does get a little nippy in the later evening hours so be sure to carry a fleece if you go here.",Avik C
50,Great venue! Can get great seats for cheap sometimes.,Attended an amazing concert with Juan Luis Guerra and his orchestra last year and the view from our right side seats was great and yet affordable. I enjoy attending concerts here more than at the bigger venues because it's outdoors and it's smaller. They have remodeled the entrance section and put in lots of casual seating for a bite before the concert. I find it more fun to go here on a date than to the Hollywood Bowl.,123marissa
10,Overpriced madness!,"Positives: None.Negatives: Stacked parking unless you want to pay $75 for Quick park. Seats are extremely close together, you're almost sitting on top of the person next you. If you want to leave a row, everyone must stand up. Very expensive. Jethro Tull on 6/1/18 was $168 for two decent seats in the North Terrace. Bathroom access is a complete joke. No employees directing traffic. Its a crush of humanity to get in and out of the restroom area. Drinks? $15 for a small beer. Exiting the location is a zoo. Pedestrians streaming into traffic lanes. Cars driving the wrong way. You are not allowed to head west on Los Feliz to the I-5. Save your money and avoid this overpriced, mad house!",ladinks
50,Outcry Tour,"I went to the OUTCRY Tour on Monday, April 9th. It was a christian concert at the Greek theatre. It was a wonderful concert and the Greek was sold out. I took public transportation to get to the Greek and took Lyft Home. the Greek Theatre is such a nice place to go for a concert, it is large but the surroundings are so nice, It is in the hills and lots of trees and just like being somewhere else. It was a good day.",dqueen1

To me, it seemed like parking was a nightmare - and expensive.The only negative, was that it is smack in the middle of a neighborhood! So getting out of the theater took a while. I would hate to live in one of the houses that line the street!",Jennifer D

50,A Great Escape From The City (While Still In The City)!,"I went here last night to see The War on Drugs and this is a really cool venue! I wanted to take advantage of the cheaper parking at an offsite lot and the complimentary shuttle and it was actually really convenient! The lot is also not far from the freeway so I got to go home after the show very quickly and efficiently. The amphitheater itself is out in the middle of Griffith Park so even though we're surrounded by the larger city of LA, it feels like we're out in the woods with the trees and hills around us! It's like a smaller, more intimate Hollywood Bowl with terraced seating. I wasn't able to find my seat during the show (since someone was sitting in it), but I was able to stand towards the edge and get a good view of the show since it appears the guards are pretty nonchalant in general about this sort of thing. Like the Hollywood Bowl, the acoustics are wonderful and every instrument sounds crystal clear! I had a great experience overall and would recommend people check out a show here sometime! :)",Colby S
50,Nickelback,What an amazing venue. Not to hard to get to as can get DASH bus. Drinks are expensive as they are at most venues but the place is well worth a visit.,karenfanti
50,Best venue in LA!,"I absolutely love going to concerts in this venue. The people who work there (inside & in parking area) are extremely helpful. Our favorite lot to park in is Lot C. It's a bit more than the stacked parking, but it's easy to get in and easy to get out. I also like to sit in Section B. If you like to stand through the concert you might want to sit in Section A. We like to go early and eat in the picnic area. Can't go wrong!",jzk131
50,"The Greek Theatre, great venue!","We attended the Greek Theatre to see Cheap Trick with Foreigner in August 2017. Loved the venue and atmosphere and I've never been to a venue where there are so many women's toilets, no lineups!",Chris C
40,Great Venue to see a show,"I finally visited The Greek for the first time and had a very nice experience! I was nervous when I drove in because traffic was so bad and I was way up in lot G and just imagined how chaotic getting out would be... But you know what... getting out was really easy! I was very surprised.It was a little wait to get into the venue, but the line moved. There are plenty of places to eat if you'd like. It just seemed very relaxed inside. Not too crazy. The sound was actually really good... MUCH better the The Hollywood Bowl. Additionally, there are NO bad seats (that I could see)! We were toward the very back and ""the very back"" here is probably half way up at The Bowl... So it feels much smaller than most amphitheater venues.Parking is $25... so that was a hit... but shame on me for not knowing that. Now YOU do! So plan for i or take alternate transport. Driving in I thought I'd never be coming back... but after my experience and ease getting out... I'd definitely come back here!",Michael T
50,Great Venue for a show.,We recently saw the Pat Benetar/Toto show. The show itself was excellent. The seating was great and this is an excellent venue to see concerts. The sound was excellent adn there were plenty of bathroom stalls. Make sure you purchase your parking ahead of time or you have to shuttle in to the venue.We enjoy going to the greek.,gameluver
40,Good concert venue. Nice setting.,"I enjoyed the concert we attended at The Greek. Good visuals, good sound system, good concessions options, and better parking/ride-share than I expected. I don't go to a lot of concerts, so I dont have a huge comparison base though. I would go to another one here though!",Sunshine_titan
50,big night of c & w in a great setting,saw sam hunt...maren morris...chris janson...ryan folesse...great atmosphere at this naturally shaped amphitheatre...plenty of food and beverage options and although pricey its a well trodden path,johnnycash3630
10,Reggae concert,Had a really poor interaction with the security here coming into the show. Parking was expensive and your cars is crammed in like sardines. Like to get in was long. Had to listen to the band I wanted to see waiting outside. When I get to the metal detector I hand over my belongings to the girl. She seems unsure about my vape pen and behind to try to tell me I can't bring it in lol. Calls it a wax pen. It wasn't. Supervisor comes over and says the same thing. Tells me I have to take it to my car.... And wait and go through security again. He begins to threaten me with kicking me out. Because they should be looking for weapons. I paid good money for tickets too. They weren't cheap. Really dissapointed.,BrianPetro
50,Parking and noise level,"Having never been to the Greek I needed to learn more about it for the Sam Hunt concert at 7PM. It was my daughters first concert and suffering headaches I searched and searched for info about parking in case we needed to leave early. Reading that most parking was stacked was not a good option so we went with the shuttle hoping we could get back to our car if need be, via Uber. We learned once we got to the shuttle parking it only ran 30 minutes before the end of the concert, this wouldn't help if we needed it. There is a large area inside gated area with concessions, benches and standing heaters that would be a great area if she needed a break. Having bought concert band member grade ear plugs, she made it through the whole concert with no headache!PARKING: Shuttle was easy $10. Shuttles were DASH, the city buses so sat lots of people. I prepurchased but it didn't seem to speed things much as they had to look up my name and amount of people. No line to get it to the shuttle lot at 6:30 and parking in a dirt lot, 2 minute walk to the shuttle and waited about 10 minutes for it to fill before we left. Shuttle was about 5 minute drive from venue and just a 3 minute walk to get to metal detector, which took only a few minutes also. At end of concert we were on the first shuttle (there were 3 buses waiting) and the parking lot was literally a 1 minute from the 5 south freeway.SEATING: When other posts say not a bad seat, what that means to me is that you are able to see the artist and he/she doesn't look like an ant. We were at the front of section C. I was able to see Sam good enough to tell he had a beard and hat not the color of his eyes. Next time I would go for section B or even the sections on the side. There were two big-ish screens but I feel that they could have been larger. That said, while sitting in the seat and looking at the stage, I would go for the right side because it is closest to the exit, they are even number seats. We were able to get up at the last encore and stand in the isle on the stairs and make a very quick exit and onto the very first shuttle.Great place to see a concert!!",AMB2
50,Great venue for a show,The Greek theatre is a great spot for a show. Nice size space with great amenities in a beautiful park location. They have modernized the video and lighting as well now.,JKPImageFusion
50,Perfect Music Venue in LA,"There's nothing like an evening at the Greek Theater. Truly magical night of fantastic music in an intimate open concert venue. Staff are all professional and welcoming.If visiting LA, take the time to look up what amazing musician might be performing while you visit.We lucked out! We saw Peter Frampton and the Steve Miller Band. Icons of Rock History is an incredible time, but to experience their talents in this setting was magical. We realized you can sit anywhere in this theater and feel close to the stage and or have a great view.Tip: Bring a picnic and a bottle of wine as there is a picnic area just below the theater entrance. If that's not possible they do have food concession stands and plenty of bars on site.Parking is about $25 and up. It seems fair considering the area. On the drive up you will drive through iconic Hollywood and see some mansions.Surrounding Area: Trendy Hollywood bars and restaurants. Plus Griffith Exploratory.",Carina Cristiano
50,Love this venue,"There are many reasons to love this venue over the Hollywood Bowl. The size of the venue is perfect for seeing a concert. There really are not any bad seats. The seating itself is so much more comfortable than the Bowl. None of those uncomfortable Bowl bench seats and every seat has a cup holder and adequate leg space. The location is so much better. The Bowl is located in the heart of Hollywood and traffic and parking there is a nightmare. The Greek is in a wonderful location at an entrance to Griffith park and you will spend half the time and cost looking for parking there. You should pay for advance parking, which will guarantee that you can get a parking spot in one of their many lots. Local restaurants do have dine and ride programs available. My opinion is that the acoustics at the Greek are so much better than other venues. The smaller stage and sound system just add to a more enjoyable concert sound. Overall a wonderful experience.Like any large venue, there are negatives. The biggest negative to me is that they do not allow you to bring food and drinks in to the Greek. This to me is a big plus at the Bowl, because the concession stand prices at the Greek are outrageous. Concert prices are expensive and they usually sell out fast because they are a smaller venue.. But be smart and sign up for Goldstar or some of the other websites that offer discount tickets.",berniek1949
50,Great outdoor venue for seeing your favorite bands or singers,"This is one of the best venues in Los Angeles for watching your favorite band or singer. Its not so big, and every seat is not that far from the stage. They also have some great food choices for eating and drinking. I highly recommend it if you've never been there.",Sally H
50,Great concert venue,"This is our favorite concert venue in Los Angeles. It is outside, great acoustics, not a bad seat in the house. Only down side is the food is only mediocre - so we recommend you eat before you arrive.",We3luv2travel
50,Wonderful place for concerts,"My brother-in-law and I went to a concert at the Greek Theatre. The acoustics was great. We could see the stage well, not to mention the two big screens in the left front and right front. By the way, it was a Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie concert. We will definitely go to another concert here",_vvc13685

40,Mini Hollywood Bowl,"Saw AIR there and this place is great. It's only a little confusing if you're sitting up in their terrace sections. Luckily a very helpful usher took us to our seats in the way back of the terrace under a tree, we would have never found our seats otherwise. The drinks are expensive, but at least they make them strong! Ordered 2 double margaritas, a carafe of rose and 2 topo chicos for $90 (with $8 tip). A nice, intimate place compared to the Hollywood Bowl.",Shelley D
50,Make the Effort to See a Show,With a son moving to LA in last 5 years been looking for a chance to see a show there. Finally did. Elvis Costello! 8-9 rows back and to the right of the stage. Similar but more intimate than the Bowl.Similar ways in and out. Took Lyft almost to entrance. We walked back to main street to catch ride back. Our son has sat near the back and said even that was a good seat,sccrref
50,John Legend Concert,This is an excellent place to see a concert! Great view no matter where you're seated and amazing acoustics!,Mel L
40,"Great place to see a show, but have an escape plan!","I went to see Flight of the Conchords here, the staff were very friendly and told me I had some kind of special ticket so I got some food at a buffet that was okay (free but okay), then I watched the concert and it was amazing! No complaints there! A wonderful experience on a beautiful night under the stars with great performers - something off my bucket list! However, trying to leave was confusing. I had taken a cab there and when people come out they are kind of herded one way (down the hill) so I followed the crowd and later on found out that the taxi station was up the hill. As I walked down the hill, I saw back to back cars in traffic moving incredibly slowly as they tried to get up the hill to pick up concert-goers or go down the hill to get out of there. I asked a taxi driver going up the hill to give me a ride up to the taxi station, he agreed, then couldn't get ahold of the people who called him initially after three tries, so he said the taxi was mine now and tried to get the heck out of there, but it was hard due to the thickness of the traffic jam. It took a while just to get back to civilization (another point against the theatre, it's kind of in the middle of nowhere, hard to get to). Don't get me wrong, I'd go again to see a concert, but just be warned...have an escape plan! :)",Chris M
50,"Awesome Venue, parking was easy!",My husband and I went to see Carlos Vives at the Greek and we really could not have had a better experience. We bought our parking online before the show for their offsite parking which was $10. We arrived around 7:15 to the Griffith Park Pony ride section as that's where the shuttles leave from. We were in the Greek by 7:45 as the shuttles were very efficient. Best part is there's no stack parking. The concert was amazing as there really is no bad seat in the house. The weather was on the cold side but they did have coffee and hot drinks for sale as well as all of the other spirits. Only thing I would have done different is worn gloves. But the dancing kept us warm and we had a great evening. I'd highly recommend any event at the Greek as it's a well managed venue.,Caroline L
50,Outdoors under the Stars - Great Venue - Great Entertainment,"The Greek Theater has been around for over 80 years and because of its intimate setting (less than 6,000 seats) and its line up of great, name talent it should be here for another 80 years. It is surrounded by trees and stars under the sky.",GaryFleishman

50,Perfect Seats for a Spectacular performance,"went to see Chris Botti and The Tenors last Summer. Love attending performances at the Greek Theater - almost ALL of the seats have unobstructed views of the stage. We were in Section B, which is straight up from the stage, and not as pricey as the ""luxury boxes"" below us. No matter what time of year you go here, make sure you have proper clothing for the temperature changes during any performance. When we arrived, it was about 86 degrees - by the time the performance was completed, it was about 60 degrees. We had tickets we won on PBS, as donating subscribers - $75 each..glad we didn't have to pay for them !!",ecurbeertbarc
40,Great Venue...Tough Parking,"The Greek is a FANTASTIC place to see a concert. This is by far the most adorable venue I've been to! Lots of places to get drinks and food. Great seats and amazingly wonderful atmosphere. The only pickle is the parking. Such is Los Angeles though. Parking is $20, and you have to park in the grassy/muddy lots and it is just stacks upon stacks of cars. To the point that you cannot get out unless people around you leave. God forbid there is an emergency. To get out of the venue you have to go through Griffith Park, the loooonggg way around. It's a beautiful drive, but after a late night at a concert the last thing I want to do is go the long way around. Regardless, I would still go back for a concert! They really need to get the parking figured out though - it seems beyond dangerous.",Robonski
40,Great venue except for handicapped,"The elevator taking us up a level got stuck and was clearly in poor repair. The staff did their best to be helpful, the problem was with the facility itself. There are an enormous amount of steps in this lovely place to see a concert but be forewarned if you have mobility issues.",662marc

50,The Head and the Heart Concert,"Of course the concert was great, but I will stick to the Greek theater. It is gorgeous. With LA weather being nearly perfect, it was the perfect backdrop to a really cool experience at the Greek. Nestled on the side of a hill with tall trees, the theater is beautiful and the acoustics were awesome. The atmosphere made the music even better.",busybusymomof4
50,Twice in one month!!,What A great venue.. I feel lucky to live close to this location. We went to both Mumford and Sons as well as the Head & the Heart. A big WOW,Heather B
50,"Open air, traditional Greek style, plan accordingly","The evening was very cool after the sun went down so what we wore for a day exploring Griffith was not what we wanted at The Greek Theater. Other than that, this was an amazing venue, well worth adding to the short list of really fun and safe things to do in LA. There's plenty of food to be purchased at the theater, across the street or bring a picnic bag to the grounds.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,Summer Nights at the Greek,"The Greek Theater is one of our favorite outdoor venues in Los Angeles. It is smaller than the Bowl, which makes it a more intimate experience. The sound quality is excellent as are the sightlines. This summer we went to see The Piano Guys and enjoyed the concert thoroughly. Please be advised that outside food is not allowed in the theater, and parking is expensive ($25). It is possible to ride the Red Line to Hollywood and Vermont and take a shuttle bus up to the theater. The concession food was tasty and you can walk down Vermont after the show for some excellent restaurants and night spots.",Victor N
50,Beautiful venue,This venue is so pretty with the mountains and trees all around. We found parking very easy (but expensive). All the staff are very friendly and helpful. A beer costs $15 which is ridiculous! Restrooms were super clean with no lines and it has great acoustics,EMP77
20,Inferior to the Hollywood Bowl -,"Just saw Mumford and Sons here last night. Had great seats - 3rd row in one of the side terraces but found the theater and experience, just average.First off -- parking is a pain-- and ranges from expensive ($25) to ridiculous ($75!! for 'quick park' which gives you the privilege to exit first.) We arrived on the later side, paid our $25 for top of the hill, F-lot parking and entered a dusty hillside.Got in relatively quickly and to our seat. Went to nearby beer line and waited about 15 minutes for the slowest possible server to pour 5 beers for people ahead. At this point, you'd think that she'd be able to pour beer in about 10 seconds, in her sleep - but she was clearly not hired for her efficient customer service. Got back to seat mid-way thru first song.Video screens are great and high-quality but the sound was not as full or clear as Hollywood Bowl or the newly-renovated Forum -- both of which are awesome. This made the whole experience, ""less than"". Would definitely shy away from shows at the Greek in the future until I hear that they improve the sound system.Leaving the show, we were routed up the hill, past Griffith Observatory -- which turned out to be a blessing since we saw an incredible moon rising near the observatory and were on the 101 in 11 minutes after getting in the car!",sailor279
40,"Cool vibe , bring a jumper in September","Nice spot , easy drop off , as usual with most arenas , transient staff , so not great ....a blanket costs 42 dollars , that would cost 5 dollars ....as open air .....Nice vibe , liked it , and the crows were awesome , and learnt about rob Thomas ....go Carlos Santana",kjh777
50,Concert,This venue is small but really amazing. No seat is a bad seat. The bathrooms have been renovated so they have 2 floors so no long lines. Parking could be better. Your basically parking in the grass/dirt if you arrive late ( concert started at 730 we arrived at 7pm) . So give yourself at least a hour before the shoe or wear comfortable shoes. There's no lighting in the grassy part so when the concert ended and we walked back to our car it was pretty scary. So just arrive a hour early and you will be fine.,Tracey T

40,Wonderful Experieince!,"Saw a rock concert there, first time ever going. Apparently there was a renovation a few years back, everything looked spotless. There's a ton of options for food and drinks all around the perimeter. Lots of security and Greek Theatre staff were everywhere to help guide us. Everyone was really helpful and polite.TONS of parking in lots everywhere around the Greek. All the parking staff were also really helpful and polite.The venue is wonderful for an outdoor show.",dougontheroad
50,Amazing experience,"Love this location, beautifully situated near mountain and hills which gave it an amazing back drop. Their sound system is wonderful. This is my 2nd time attending concert here. Last time we came for Above and Beyond, this time we came for Sarah McLaughlin and Josh Grobin. Concerts are amazing here. Recommend to bring cushion to sit on because these are hard plastic seats. This is an open air theater so bring a jacket or blankets to keep warm. Recommend to go online and reserve/pay for parking in advance. They do have food at this place so we ordered cheese burger $11+ sweet potatoes fries $6 +2 coke($10)= $27. Food taste and quality are more toward cafeteria/food court. Price is slightly high for what you are getting.",Thu P
50,Magical,"Recently went to a concert here....what a fabulous venue. Parking is a little bit of a pain, and expensive...but certainly didn't detract from the evening. The atmosphere was fantastic.

A memorable evening, can't wait to go back and watch another show. Thank you!",Anna B

50,Perfect date night venue,"This place is my favorite place I have seen a concert. It's a really small venue, and I think pretty much every seat is a good seat, although of course the closer you are to the stage, the nicer it is. We were about 2/3rds of the way towards the back, but we could still see the stage just fine. The sound quality was good no matter where you were in the place.We got there early and hiked around the trails a bit, it was really pretty, and we got a great view of L.A, not to mention a great facebook photo of my husband, ha. The whole area is really nice, just a fun out of the way place to go. There were even Pokemon stops, lol, I had to check of course, because I'm a dork like that.We had eaten before we got there, but later on the hubby was hungry, so we bought the fruit and cheese plate from the concession stand and it was really nice food for a concert place. Nothing fancy, but hit the spot.Even the bathrooms are nice. And the crowd was really mellow and easygoing (of course, it WAS Boz Scaggs and Michael MacDonald, so it's expected to be an older crowd).Parking was super easy, we parked in the lot BEFORE you hit the venue, super easy getting in and out. There is a nice picnic area right there and even bbq's if you wanted to grill something.I would TOTALLY go to another show here.",Simple M
50,Not a bad seat in the house,"Okay, to be clear, I have not sat in each seat to be sure, but the size of this venue is perfection. It's tucked into the hillside and quite intimate. I sat just a few rows back from the stage a month ago, and last night sat in the North Terrace (which is up and off to the side) and didn't feel as though there was a tremendous difference between the two. I still felt a part of the action with great views of the artists.",WinnerLauren
40,A large Alabama shake with fries,"The Greek theater is a beautiful venue. It is located in the same area as the Griffith observatory. The Griffith observatory at the top of the hill will give you massive views of LA and surrounding areas, lots of photo ops especially for the Hollywood sign. At the bottom of the hill is where the Greek theater is located. I came to see the band Dawes and Alabama shakes. The music was fantastic and venue really uniquely laid out. Look at a seating chart and you will know what I mean. I had tickets on hand but I did check the box office before to see if anything was available and they did have tickets to purchase. If you happen to be in the area and never been to a show at the Greek, I highly suggest you make an effort to go. Long beer lines before the main act that do move quickly.",Rgd973
50,Cupholders in the toilets! Who'd have thunk!,"Saw Boz Scaggs and Michael MacDonald, and checked off one more LA bucket list item. We were in moderately priced seats towards the back, but I doubt if there is a bad seat. A very intimate feel and great acoustics.People brought picnics, but we bought on site. There was a good healthy choice salad which I loved.My friend bought reserved parking online. Being Angelinos, they think anything more than free is expensive, but between four of us it was only a few dollars each.It was easy to get in and out of...a few days later we went to Hollywood Bowl - that was more challenging!A recommended venue. If carless, there is a shuttle which if other LA shuttles is anything to go by, will be very efficient.",Arncliffegirl

10,This great place was ruined by the bad crowd and lack of controls by the staff.,"I have always thought that the Greek was the best place to see a concert. Until tonight. We saw Peter Wolf and the Steve Miller Band. This was like torture. As the sun went down, the amount of pot being smoked was insane. I could smell it, it burned my eyes and throat, and I could see it all around the theatre, with the closest one to me four rows down. There were NO control over this. I asked the blue shirts and they said the yellow shirts are watching for it. I did not see one all night. The first show, Peter Wolf, was also ruined by some fanatic behind me, clapping incessantly as loud as she could, OFF THE BEAT. When you are sitting in front of someone with your ear really close to their hands, it is actually painful. Did the lady stop, NO. Thousands of claps came out of this crazed woman. All slightly off the beat. It was insane. Granted, this isn't the Greek's fault. The night got worse. People decided that they wanted to stand up and ""shake it."" How can you shake it to ""Space Cowboy,"" you might ask. Well, a 60+ year old woman bumped and grinded in a strip tease type dance, standing three rows in front of me so that no one behind could see, for two full songs until her friend pulled her down. So what does this have to do with the Greek? Well, once one person stood up, everyone stood up, and the way the monitors are, I could not see the stage, nor could I see the monitors. So I saw nothing. So this kept happening and happening, and finally we left. We didn't see anything pretty much the whole Steve Miller performance. So since this is allowed, to just stand up whenever you want to, then they really should put a monitor higher up so that people who pay can actually SEE the show and not just old people shaking themselves back and forth. The person next to me was so drunk she could barely stand up. There are also rules about this, but they were not enforced. I am not the only one that felt this way. Everyone leaving on the shuttle was talking about the same things. It was totally ridiculous. These people were adults, most of them senior citizens. Let's hope their kids behave better. Perhaps the Greek needs to play some commercials like NO SMOKING and NO STANDING and BE CONSIDERATE and such. Or maybe not invite any Steve Miller Fans back.",LAtoEverywhere

Getting to The Greek Theatre is soooo much easier than negotiating the Hollywood Bowl. And not as many seats so you do not feel that you are traveling in the opposite direction of a stampede to get food, drink or use the facilities. Seats are very comfortable. Crowd control was professional and the fans respectful. If you arrive early, there is paid parking near picnic tables under shady trees. You can plan a refreshing, enjoyable picnic and relax before entering the venue. Walking distance from parking to the venue us reasonable. The Greek Theatre is my new favorite venue!!!",ZZiDive
40,Great outdoor venue,This is a great outdoor amphitheater built into the hillside below the Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park. You pass it when you first enter the park on Vermont. We saw it entering the park and then as we climbed Mount Hollywood. The best part of the theater is that as we reached the summit we had a great ability to hear the music s if we were in the theater. It was a Sunday afternoon and they had someone playing. I just thought the view of the venue from the mountain top and the fact you could hear the music was great.,Grover R

40,Great Venue for an Outdoor Summer Concert,"Excellent parking attendant guidance (although the web site was down to buy advanced parking). Comfortable seating. Very good sound quality. More intimatethan the Hollywood Bowl. Once inside, limited rest room facilities. Poor food and drink choices (and expensive).",Charis2009
50,Evening under the Stars,"The Greek Theatre is a great venue to see Live shows, recently saw Ringo Starr's All Star Band. As always this venue has good sound, is very pleasant Southern California weather, a really good crowd of people to share a show with. All the seats in this venue have good views of the stage and giant screens up on the sides. The atmosphere here is more friendly than some of the local indoor venues. The biggest drawback to this venue is the parking since they do ""stacked"" parking on grass in the nearby park areas. Sometimes getting out after a show can take a really long time to negotiate.",Jim B
40,Organized and great seats,"We saw a concert at the Greek for the first time and were amazed at how many good seats there were. It seems like almost all seats have a great view. I had read some parking horror stories so I purchased a parking pass online beforehand. It was $20 and that's too much, but it would have been more onsite. There were many parking attendants directing people where to go. As we entered the theater, we saw large cans of beer being sold for $15-outrageous!!! We bought a bag of popcorn, and that was $7. The plastic seats were quite comfortable, better than the concrete benches at the Hollywood Bowl. We had some young guys behind us who wouldn't stop talking, so we found some empty seats closer to the stage. Win-win. We left before the final song so I don't know what exiting was like for everyone else. The theater is in a residential section of Hollywood and you do need to keep the noise down in respect for those people.The best thing about the Greek Theater was the many, many stalls in the ladies rooms! It seemed like there were hundreds! And they had cupholders! But at $15 per drink, I'd want to carry it with me wherever I went.",Alexandra T
50,Fabulous Place to see a Concert,"The Greek Theatre in LA is a Fabulous Outdoor Venue to see a Concert! Built into the Hollywood Hills, it offers spectacular scenery all around. General Parking in Lots A,B, H & ADA ($20 before day of show) was well worth the money spent. Even that was a bit of an uphill walk to venue. Plenty of traffic directors helped with congestion coming and going. Nice selection of food vendors, so arrive early and get a bite before the show.",Gibsoninpa
40,Terrific Staff Working the Show,"Went to see Collective Soul and the Goo Goo dolls last night. My wife and I were blown away how polite all the staff were. From the parking attendants, shuttle driver, crossing guards, ticket scanners, and to the ushers, every one was pretty friendly and didn't seem forced at all. That is a rarity nowadays.. Enjoyed the concert, good acoustics, good sitelines, and reasonably clean and huge bathrooms. Food was expensive, sweet potato fries and bottle water was $11. The offsite parking at Griffith park worked out really well for $10. Saved us a lot of hassle.",peterlc63
30,Nice venue,Three stars because the flood and drink is way overpriced and the traffic control is not that great. I am sure that the quality of sound and loudness depends on what type of equipment the artists bring with them. The sound and clarity is always good there. Bathroom was clean and plenty of spaces open. It is a bit crazy when you first get in trying to figure out which set of stairs you take to get to your seats and the continually traffic back and forth. Best idea is drink and eat before you come and Uber to and from there.,ballerina501
40,"Good show, good seats, great price","The Boston concert at the Greek Theater was very good. Played mostly their old hits. Dennis DeYoung was pretty good too. Purchased tickets through Goldstar and as always the seats were good. Since the Greek is relatively small most seats are pretty good. Weather was nice. Wore short sleeves and didn't need my jacket until near the end of the show. Food and drinks are so expensive at the Greek, as are most other venues. We did eat before we went. Purchased offsite parking for $10 and took the shuttle. Very easy and convenient.",daytrippergal
50,Incredible venue! Doesn't get much better than this on a warm summer night....,"Saw Bryan Adams concert in July, 2016. First time at the Greek Theatre. Beautiful setting under the stars. Very relaxed atmosphere outside the seating area. Wide selection of food. Restrooms are incredibly spacious and clean! Park at the Griffith Park Pony lot for only $10 (in advance).",Richard R
40,Great Schedule +Smaller/Easier than Hollywood Bowl,"We went for a Ringo and His All-Star band. You know most of the music wasn't a nostalia trip for me, but I must acknowledge that it was all well played with many riffs of pure virtuosity. All the members of the band shared in that virtuosic glory.The theater itself is far easier to get into and get out of compared to the Hollywood Bowl. As we waited for showtime, the displays showed all the stuff coming up through the end of October and there were half a dozen shows we would come back for if we lived in the area.",Richard_StL
50,She's With Us,"This was the greatest experience ever! The Greek Theatre is wonderful! The Hillary Clinton concert, She's With Us, was amazing! I couldn't believe all of the artists who performed-----John Legend, Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilar, Ricky Martin, etc., and all of the celebrities who spoke on Hillary's behalf, including Cher, Eva Longoria, Magic Johnson, etc. All of the seats at the Greek Theatre are great as is the selection of food and drinks. I would have liked Hillary Clinton souvenirs sold there and was disappointed that there were none being sold. Overall, it was a great experience!",Babylammie
50,Beautiful outdoor space for music in the middle of Griffith park,The Greek is a wonderful venue to see smaller acts; I have seen Weird Al Yankovic and the Gypsy Kings here. Sort of a mini Hollywood Bowl; they make parking relatively painless and it's always wonderful to be outside listening to music in Southern California.,AnonymousDragon

40,Love the Greek,"Seen some big names here and small. Very intimate space outside under the stars with trees all around. Great venue like a mini Hollywood Bowl. Only downside is the food on offer, it sucks and you can't bring a picnic like the Hollywood bowl so eat before you go.",Claudia M
50,Performances in the Trees ...,"Love the Greek and look forward to attending a few performances each summer & have done so for many years. The Greek's classic bowl is nestled into a hillside surrounded by trees - excellent acoustics. Parking is a challenge, so plan ahead. I've found that using the shuttle works best! Enjoy your favorite performer. ...",David B L

50,One of the best venues in the USA,"We've been to the Greek for jazz, classical, crooner events. Recently went to see 21 Pilots (look them up if you haven't heard of them) and this is by far one of the top 5 concerts I've been to. Since I go back to Springsteen and that era, this covers some time. The venue contributed to the experience immeasurably. Come early, prepurchase Parking Lot D and you'll have a great evening.",glen h
50,Best outdoor venue in LA,"We have been to a few concerts at the Greek Theatre and find it is the best outdoor venue up against the Hollywood Bowl and the Ford Theater. Ford is great for small concert, Greek for mid-large sized concert and Hollywood bowl for large concerts. Parking is down to a science. Get there early so you don't get stuck behind someone who is still in the venue getting souvenirs or using the restroom.",lkstumm
50,Good location,"Show: Non-stop music! David Gray just kept singing his heart out. The whole theater was packed. The last 15 minutes of the show was definitely the highlight.... all his great hits! Love it~ Thanks to Yelp LA for giving us the opportunity to enjoy such a great show!!Food: No outside food inside the theater. But there is picnic area across street from the theater near the parking lots. There are 3 food vendors and a few bars selling drinks inside the theater.Parking: Off-site Shuttle service:$7 per vehiclePurchase parking permit on Greek Theater website & print out the ePermit.The parking lot is right off Fwy 5 Los Feliz exit. There is huge sign showing where to turn. The staffs will check the parking permit with their list & issue wrist band for each passenger.Always more than one shuttle waiting at the parking lot, no wait time. Few minutes ride to Greek Theater. The shuttles don't stop right in front of the theater, however, just a few minutes walk.The same location to take the shuttle back to parking lot after the show. I left the show during the encore because I'm not sure how long the line would be. There are already more than 5 shuttles waiting.Once get to the parking lot, just a short drive to jump on Fwy 5!! Super convenient!Will totally take the shuttle service again.",ILoveFoodComa
50,The best venue,"I have been to a lot of concerts and by far this is the best venue. It was easy in and out and no hour long wait to go home, the surroundings are beautiful and the sound was amazing. I was in the pit for a Social D concert and was next to the speaker and naturally I thought I would have gone deaf at the end of the night, but surprisingly not at all. The sound was amazing! I would prefer to seek out concerts based on how great everything was at the Greek.",Christy M
50,Outdoor Extravaganza,"Maybe it's the open night air, the trees and hills surrounding it, or the stars above, but the evening spent listening to music here, is well worth the addmission fee. Parking near the Greek Theatre is really bad though. It's easier to park south of Los Feliz and walk up, than it is to park near it and be stuck in the outgoing traffic after a concert.",Marine Y
40,Great concerts for a reasonable price,Purchase offsite parking passes ahead of time. Shuttles are no hassle quick way of getting there. Most all seats are good as it is relatively small. Weather was comfortable but needed a sweater later on during the concert. Some people brought blankets. Concerts sounded good. They have food and drinks (alcohol and sodas) for a price. Concerts are reasonably priced.,daytrippergal
50,An Excellent Venue!,"The Greek Theatre is an excellent concert venue. With Griffith Park in the surrounding area, the theatre offers a great musical experience with a wonderful outdoor ambiance . On-site food choices are good, staff were friendly and helpful, and seats were comfortable for an outside arena. Viewing of the stage is good from the center section seats. However on-site parking can be a challenge. Overall, Highly Recommended!",Robert V
50,Excellent,Truly fabulous venue for a concert in a wonderful settingFirst time at the Greek first time in Los AngelesWent to see Joe Bonamassa American blues legend and his 3 Kings tour a tribute to BB Albert and Freddie. Joe didnt disappoint he was first class all the wayThe venue is right in the middle of Griffiths Park which although a bit sun dried due to the drought i guess is still spectacular -right at the very top of it you can just see the iconic hollywood signFood and drink outside the venue are very expensive indeed- i bought a medium sized can of beer for $11.50. Ouch. Best bring your own!Leaving the venue is just like any large auditorium-the greek has a 5000 capacity-its a bit chaotic.I didnt drive and cabbed it there-walking out of the venue down the hill is bit difficult the lighting is very poor and the pavement a veritable obstacle course! So be warned!One thing to note is that T mobile signal is non existent at the greek and you need to walk a mile or so to get connected,zeon40

50,Refreshing break from the summer heat,"We recently attended a concert in the exceptionally hot summer in LA. It's a beautiful venue as other reviews have said. I will add two things I didn't see covered before. First we found it easy to Uber or taxi right to the venue and avoid the parking lines and chaos (cheaper too). Then, we simply walked about 15 minutes downhill out of the exiting cars and neighborhood to call a car home after the concert. Arrived immediately. Second look for the hidden bar called Zeus at the top of the North end terrace. In the trees we were able to sit and visit with friends while still hearing the concert.",Texasxtravelers

50,My Favorite Venue in LA,I've seen so many shows here over the last few years and it is my absolute favorite venue in all of Los Angeles. Not only is the location beautiful but there's not a bad seat in the house. It is a perfect outdoor yet intimate venue to see your favorite artists. I love the Greek but know that the traffic driving up the hill and parking can be a little bit of a pain so make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to get there.,Phil E
50,Greek is Great!!,"I saw Andrew Bird here. The venue has to be one of the best in the entire world. Parking was easy and then we got a drink and finger food in the VIP area. As the sun went down, the excellent acoustics gently floated over the crowd who were left transfixed. This place is inspiring.",ItsMarkyMark1975
40,Get Me to The Greek,"One of the best outdoor venues in the States. Went to see Alison Krause and Willie Nelson. Nederlander does a fabulous job managing the facility. It was raining, a rarity in SoCal yet all the staff from traffic, parking, ticket takers and ushers were friendly and doing the best they could to assist people. The show was held for 15 minutes while it poured and then it cleared up and was just a great night of music.",koolie40
50,Something Magical About This Place,"I recently saw Ben Folds here. I've seen close to 15 shows here in my life, and every time, I have a huge smile on my face. My first concert I ever saw was here, so it holds sentimental value for me as well. The beautiful surroundings and the sound quality are tough to beat! It seats 5800, yet still feels intimate. What else can I say? When I think about some of the things that make Los Angeles a charming city, The Greek Theatre definitely comes to mind.",julesandjeff
50,The Greek Theatre. Forever and always.,"A beautiful setting in the hills, attentive staff, offering great choices in music, it is no wonder that the Greek Theatre has been voted the Best Venue by its peers for the last 10 years. Friendly vibes and good times. Everything you need, right there on site. Great food and cocktails to choose from, and plenty of activities before the show. This venue is a must see for all out-of-towners, and a go-to place for all locals. Check it out.",Robyn W
40,A good time!,"Well, trip advisor isn't giving me the option of telling you in truth I haven't been here in at least 3 or 4 years, but I'm pretty sure everything is the same as it has been for at least the last 30+! :) My first time here was also my first concert, 1988 to see the Monkees! It was as chill & fun as it was the many MANY times I went in my teens & 20's :) There's just nothing like sitting outside, enjoying the night air with a cold drink & good music. You really can't go wrong.",Lydia A
40,Nice place for a concert.,It is a outdoor venue and has a lot of pretty grass areas for picnic before the show. There are plenty of food and alcohol to purchase at very high prices so bring your own. Best to be in the first 20 rows if you want to see the performers on stage and really enjoy the show.,SDMom12
50,Awesome concert venue!,"Just love this concert venue! Much better than the Hollywood Bowl as it is smaller and a bit more intimate. We had seats in the upper left section towards the back, but could still see fairly well. The bathroom facilities were very clean and had decent prices on beer and wine. Didn't have any food and didn't really look at the menu at all. Heard parking could be a problem if you go where there is stacked parking so we splurged on the $50 VIP parking. You pull in to the center lane directly in front of The Greek. Very convenient and well worth the cost in my opinion.",CStewart826
20,The Greek,A bit difficult to get to and security yelled at patrons to keep walking down the hill when the concert was over. Cabs were not allowed through for pick ups. I'll stick to Hollywood venues in the future.,Morafun

40,Date night concert,The Greek Theater is a beautiful venue. A few tips..Try the dine and dash option to avoid the hideous stacked parking. You can pre dine at participating restaurants and they shuttle you right out front of the Greek and then pick you up and return you to the restaurant after the ahow.,Shannon R
50,Fantastic outdoor amphitheater,"All seats are comfortable seats with a good view. Definitely a fair-weather venue since it's outdoors. Concessions and restrooms got pretty crowded, but there are tables to sit at, and the surrounding scenery is very nice. The down side of this venue is only one very crowded street in and out, and you may have to park quite far away if you don't get there early. The venue is located between Griffith Park and a very nice residential neighborhood. I would still recommend this Theatre to a friend in spite of the access and parking challenges.",James G
50,Love it,"Came here for Cinquanta with Puscifer, A Perfect Circle and Failure. We had VIP tickets and it was the best concert I've ever been to!",jesska2369
50,Great venue,"We love the intimate location and all seats are great seats. Parking ranges from $7 by shuttle up to $50 by valet quick park and $15, $20, $25, $30 for the lots surrounding the venue. If interested in dinner and theater, there are recommended restaurants on their website down the street, you can bring a picnic basket to enjoy on the tables near the venue or you can pre-order a picnic basket in advance and enjoy just prior to the show. See link below. This is one of our favorite outdoor venues in the area. We usually do the quick park and pre order a picnic basket out of convenience and for the ambiance. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.",Stmartin1
50,Judy Blue Eyes,"I LOVE the Greek and would literally visit the venue to watch someone untie their shoes. It's intimate, in a lovely setting, and just the perfect size. I've seen many bands here before, but the Crosby, Stills & Nash crowd was exceptionally fun and friendly and I danced with more strangers than the number of friends I've accumulated over life. Just a GREAT CROWD! Love the GREEK!!",HBWillsy

50,Always a great venue!,"Was just there 2 weeks ago for the season closing concert. The show was great (which is obviously irrelevant for this review!) but there really is not a bad seat in the house, the sound is good and your under the stars in LA. If you can get one of the VIP boxes which were added a few seasons ago even better - you can order food and drinks to be served in your seat and avoid the lines.Go anytime!",DBronchick
40,Great acoustics in the Great Outdoors,"Moonlight filtering through branches of the trees on a recent balmy evening. Wow! This is a wonderful place to enjoy music with a cozy amphitheatre where almost every seat is a good seat. The drive there up winding neighborhood streets and the catch-as-catch-can parking is not ideal, but if you give plenty of time, keep a cool head and expect to enjoy a bit of a walk to the venue - it delivers an experience that is well worth the trouble. Our seats slightly left of center about six rows back were ideal.",Lindissima14

50,Great venue!,"Catch a concert here in summer and U'll never forget it! The y say there isn't a bad seat In the house but only because of the beautiful surrounding hills, and moonlit nights. When buying tickets always aim for the middle if the front is unaffordable .",Civilized

50,One of my favorite concert settings,My first concert here was a shocker. We parked in tandem and i thought we would be stuck waiting for hours to get out of the place. To my surprise it was super fast. Faster that when I went to concerts with regular parking lots! The venue is designed in multiple levels offering resturants and food venders. I recommend a reservation at the resturant or ordering food in advance of the show...that way you get something healthy. Bathrooms are clean.Seating is comfortable and a great concert experience.,eastcoast91
40,Take the tour if you have time!,"We visited to take the tour of the theater. We were a little sad to see that there was a movie showing at the time we wanted to take our tour. Because of this we didnt get to go on stage or see the theater with the lights on. They discount the price since you dont get to see everything. The tour guide was nice and knowledgeable. He took s through the lobby and told us about the history of the theater and showed us all of the costumes/outfits on display. We did get to go inside the theater while the movie was playing. He took us in a side door and let us take a seat for about 5 minutes and watch the IMAX movie. We went into the ladies dressing rooms and he told us about the celebrities that use this room to prepare for primers there. We then walked outside and he shows us a couple of the most famous hand/foot prints. They do invite you to return after the movie is over and see the theater with the lights on...I don't know if there is an additional cost, or if you would just show your time stamped ticket from the tour you already took.",MrsSchlosser

50,One of my favorite Music Venues not only in Los Angeles but the US,"I grew up in the area and have always enjoyed going to a concert at the Greek Theatre. I have been coming to the Greek Theater since the late 70s. If you want a great open air music venue that is not too large with great sounds this is the venue to go to under the stars. It's not too large a venue where all seats are very good seats and on a beautiful summer night it is one of the best places to watch a concert. You're surrounded by trees and the the open sky above you takes you to another place. The short drive up off the main street Los Feliz and Vermont leaves you at a nice venue. I've never enjoyed the parking there but because this is a pretty small venue it's not too bad. If you want to take a date to the Greek and impress her this is the place. I saw Sade many many years ago and listening to her music with the stars and night sky above made for a great evening. Also Los Feliz is a pretty nice area with a good selections of restaurants to have a bite before or after the show. It's also only minutes from Hollywood or the valley. The area is very nice and the homes in the hills are beautiful. You can see different architectural styles from Spanish, English Tudor to homes designed by Nuetra. It's not as well known as Laurel Canyon or any of the west side areas but I'd take Los Feliz over any of them. The observatory is just up the road and driving up you can see some fantastic views of this city or go to the Laserium light show. The Greek Theatre has always drawn some great acts as well as some not so well known ones but I think you will always enjoy any show they have there. One of my favorite music venues anywhere. If you have never seen a concert there I would highly recommend it for a nice enjoyable evening under the stars. sorry for that cliche'.",David R

40,"Love the Theater, Hate the Parking","I've been the the Greek at least 40 times in my life, it's been one of the premier concert venues in LA forever.It's not too big so even if you're sitting way in the back, you can still see the stage and the sound is excellent. I've sat as close as row 10 and as far back as 2nd from the last row.The bathrooms are sufficient for the size of the venue, usually no line, at least in the men's.The parking is horrible unless you opt for the premium parking which is very expensive. It's stacked parking, on the grass, sometimes on a hill so don't bring your nice sports car unless you want to pay extra.It's the luck of the draw where you park, and how trapped you'll be behind a row of cars. I like to leave quickly and beat traffic, but it doesn't matter here. You're at the mercy of the cars around you as to when you can leave.",ToddHata

50,Gorgeous Greek,"Great venue to see anyone! Not a bad seat in the entire house view-wise and definitely not sound-wise. The far side terrace seats can be a very little bit over loud as the speakers are right there but that is a personal preference. Concession lines are short and if they even look longer they end up being very quick. Okay food, standard fare. Standard drinks, reg. and alcohol. Bathrooms very large, roomy, clean and not ever a line. Parking is ok, $20 stacked and non - not too bad to get out of but expect a wait. I take the shuttle - recommended. Cheaper and easier. Staff is amazing. Helpful, fun and sincere. Great place.",follyfx

50,Best Outdoor Concert Venue In Los Angeles,"I have been going to the Greek in Griffith Park since I was a child. This is one of the best outdoor concert venues in the world. Situated in one of the largest urban parks on the planet, it is still intimate for the less than 5,000 audience members. The season runs from April though November.They feature all kinds of music, so check their website, or the ticket sites for who's playing, and the cost. I like to go early and bring a picnic to eat before the show. The one downside is the parking. Generally, it is stacked, so you are at the mercy of those around you, as to what time you get to leave the venue. You can get better parking, for a price, but you need to check with the venue directly, or check that website ! love this place, it is a true sonic gem here in L.A.",Steven B

50,Best outdoor sound that I've heard!,"This place is built on the side of a hill just north of Hollywood Blvd. The parking can be a little crazy. My advice, if you drive your own car, get there early and park at the first grass spot on the left. You will be on your way home in no time.

50,The Best Little Big Concert Venue in LA!,My husband and I had attended at least 10 concerts in this theater and the least i can say is that there is NO bad seat in any of the seat in this concert. Sound system is awesome ! Accessibility is great! And most of all they always have the best line up of artist in town. The parking though can be an issue as we always park in the overflow but that is how it is in most concert venues here in LA anyway. It's not too big when you cannot see the artist anymore in stage and really just being outside in the park helps to have that outdoor feel while enjoying good music! This place never fails and we always look forward to the summer concert series! In fact this year we have 3 concerts line up we will be seeing !,dagkim
50,Great Venue,One of the few theater in So cal that is an open air venue! Great place to see a Concert. Plan a day to enjoy all the Greek area has to offer.,CaliHawaii
40,Great outdoor venue.,Atmosphere and sound is great. Food isn't - don't count on it. Better to do the picnic thing. I found the lines for wine and drinks to be reasonable - prices are what you would expect.,BiancaPhilly
50,Iconic Los Angeles Concert Venues,"The Greek Theater is an outdoor ampitheater in the hills of Los Angeles. Parking is a bit difficult, but the coziness of the venue, quality of the sound system and excellent sightlines makes it well worth the effort. This is an outstanding concert venue.",Eric G
50,One of THE BEST outdoor venues around!,"Considering I'm from Denver and I have been to Red Rocks at least 200+ times for concerts, I have pretty high expectations of outdoor venues. And you know what? The Greek Theatre is DEFINITELY on my Top 5 list! Parking is not nearly as big of a nightmare as it is at the Hollywood Bowl. You can choose regualr parking lot style parking without having to take out a bank loan, or you can make an evening out of it and sign up for Dine and Ride which is SUCH a cool deal. For one price. you get to choose a restaurant which includes dinner and a drink, you park at the restaurant and their van will pick you up at a scheduled time, and drive you RIGHT TO THE ENTRANCE. After the show...the same van will pick you up RIGHT OUTSIDE the entrance and WISK you away, back to your car at your point of origin. TOTALLY AWESOME! Anyway, back to the venue itself....parking is bearable. There are a ton of food options to choose from and I can honestly say, there are no bad seats here. The sound is phenomenal. Period. BRING a blankie and/or a coat because honestly it IS going to get CHILLY. You are up inside Griffith Park where the tempaerature does drop at night. You will feel as though you are tucked away in a forest somewhere. TOO COOL! The only downside is getting there for a weeknight performance if you don't live nearby...thanks to LA traffic. YUCK! I LOVE this venue and the fact that my Mom and Dad had one of their first dates here to see Johnny Mathis back in the day makes it all the sweeter!",Sally M
40,Powerful Sound System!,"I've been here for 2 concerts and they have been amazing! The setting of the Greek Theater is beautiful and they have a great sound system. I would have given them 5 stars, but the parking sucks. BUT, they do a really good job at organizing the traffic flow. I got around the traffic by getting there 1 1/2 hrs early and picnicking in the park. Overall, great location.",Marina V
50,I'd see any show there.,"Sometimes a great show in LA involves the Whiskey or El Rey experience - the epitome of urban nightlife. The Greek is almost the opposite of that. It is nestled in Griffith Park where the background noise and lights of the city disappear. It is a wonderful venue for a show - easy to relax at, and easy to party at.",Katy P
30,Small and Intimate,"Went for a graduation. The parking was horrible, but what was worse was trying to leave the venue. The theatre was small and intimate, which would make it ideal for concerts.",PineappleGirl206
50,Try to catch a show here.,This was a magical night of exceptional music under the stars! It was a bit cool so bring a sweater to blanket. Also a very good idea to pay for the VIP parking. This saved us over an hour on the arrival and departure it was worth every penny of the extra $50.,GJAJKJ
50,Great Venue!,"This is a wonderful place to see your favorite artist. I paid a bit extra to buy parking (in advance online) in ""D"" lot and it was a very smooth and convenient setup. Remember to print your parking pass and bring it with you!The venue is lovely and it was nice to get a drink and dinner at the venue and not to feel rushed. They will sell you a bottle of wine, which they decant into a plastic bottle so no worries about broken glass.Do bring a fleece or blanket since it can get chilly once the sun goes down. I had a seat about midway back and having binoculars was also nice.",Smokeyham
40,Great venue,"Great venue - saw Il Volo - three amazing young tenors.Only complaint was $50 ""valet"" parking - which was a parking spot across from entrance to theater. Take a seat cushion and dress warm for the evening.",WildcatDad
50,A great venue,There is a great dining option you can order online and also order wine from before the event and it is pretty good! Parking is easy to get in and out of and of course the event we went to was awesome. Not allowed to bring in food like the Hollywood Bowl,travelshooter71
50,Excellent ... Very impressed,"First time to the Greek and impressed. We flew in in for a concert and enjoyed the event. Beautiful location, open forum, very organized, exceptional venue. Parking was very organized for the amount of people. Small lines, food was good and seating is good from any location. Will definitely go again.",l r
50,Lovely outdoor music venue with great sound!,"Really good bands, most seats are great, and the sound is excellent. Check upcoming listings for bands, and craigslist or gold star for tickets. One caveat is that a few of the less expensive seats are behind poles and have obstructed view. Don't get those.",EricaKellyMartin
50,The best concert venue!,"I love this theatre, no matter where you are seated its a great seat, quite intimate in fact, I love how your free to dance and roam around, lots of venders with great food too. A highly recommended night out to see your favourite musicians.",Newlifenotinoz
50,MY SPOT FOR CONCERTS!,"The Greek is probably my favorite venue for summer concerts. Though I like the Hollywood Bowl very much as well, I prefer the Greek, because it's more quaint. Nothing is nicer than to catch a concert of one of your favorite artists here on a hot summer night!",Tina C
30,my husband's dream,Ever since Hot August Night's was released my husband has always wanted to see the Greek theatre. Unfortunately it's only open when a show is on . No chance of a view without paying to see artist (never heard),Thedancer2014
50,Great Venue,What a wonderful place to go and listen to music outdoors on a bright and beautiful evening. The only issue is the curvy streets and good old parking. Tough but worth the trip.,Susan H
50,Favortie Concert Venue,I love everything about this venue.... no bad seats as far as I'm concerned. If I could I would see every concert there. Love the atmosphere and everything about it!!,Darby30
40,Great place to see a show - just be prepared!,"I recently took a trip to California to see a 2 night special event show featuring A Perfect Circle and Puscifer, and I right off the bat have to say this is an awesome venue to see a show. Nestled right in some mountains in the park, with really nice lit walkways and tables and chairs just outside the seating areas. The sound for the show was great, and we sat one night in the upper level and one night much closer to the stage and both areas the viewing angles were good and we could see just about everything.But be prepared! It is only really reasonably reachable by car, and you may very well have no cell service once you are there. I know it is easy to just blame one carrier, (I have T-Mobile - I know, not the best service nationally) But there were tons of people complaining about the same thing from different carriers. If you are like me and were relying on a cab to get you in and out of the area, you may end up having to do what me and many others had to do - walk all the way out of the park (took at least 20 minutes) to get out to the main road to wave down a cab.But aside from those minor inconveniences, this place is awesome and totally worth it to see a show.",PatHughes
50,Great concert venue,"The Greek theater is a wonderful place to see a concert. It is beautiful, and every seat is a good seat. The bathrooms are large, and the lines move quickly.",Blondi2104
40,Great Concert Venue,"We traveled to LA from the East Coast for a concert at the Greek, and overall it was a great experience. The acoustics are fantastic for an outdoor venue that makes you feel like you're in the middle of the woods. The stacked parking that will cost you $20 was the only real downside, but we only had to wait 10 or so minutes to get out. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",Maxcat1220
40,"Parking, parking, parking","The Greek theater in and of itself is only rivaled by the nearby Hollywood Bowl for outdoor amphitheater concerts. Great venue and good acoustics to see live acts, but the tickets aren't cheap, food is overpriced for what you get, and the parking is pricey and a pain in the neck to navigate. Expect long lines getting into and out of the Greek if you're going to see a concert there.",Jerry Crawford
40,Wonderful Venue,"The Greek Theatre, located in Griffith Park, is a premiere outdoor venue of Los Angeles. Top performers come here to entertain fans in the beauty of the outdoors, with the sky and the stars as your ceiling. Truly, the only downside to this facility is the atrocious stacked parking. You just have to be very patient - and hope you don't have an emergency that calls you away.",feiden
50,Great Concert Lineup Year After Year,"If you are a music fan, it's very likely one of your favorites will be performing at the Greek. Check who is performing and try to get your tickets as far in advance as possible. Scalpers, they call themselves ""ticket agents,"" seem to always have the best seats at prices way beyond the actual ticket price. If you want a really good seat, you may have pay an inflated price.That being said, the Greek is a great place for a show under the stars",TravelinAlan
40,Great Concert Venue,"If you like outdoor concerts, the Greek is one of the premiere places. It is a bit more intimate than the Hollywood Bowl, but just a comfortable. Parking is similar to the Bowl - stacked during performances and lots of traffic congestion at the end of the evening. Top acts come here and tickets sell out quickly; however, there are often deals on Goldstar, Groupon, and Living Social.",RabbiWendy
40,great setting for concerts,Out door venue. good experience. well maintained.good selection of different types of performances.Can be pricey depending on the act.,ldmather
50,Awesome intimate place for a concert,"Say Thievery Corporation here last fall. Every seat is good. Parking seems like a mess, but they get you out fast.",prdx2222
50,Wish there was something similar in New Jersey!,"I don't know that I'd ever actually move to California, but if I could create a replica of the Greek Theatre and bring it with me wherever I go (presently, I'm currently in New Jersey), I would! It's been a few years since I've been to California and caught a show at the Greek, but I distinctly remember it being an awesome venue! Open-air venues are my absolute favorite, I just love how the sound travels. The Greek is moderately sized, which makes it possible for many different artists to add to their tour itineraries. I always follow the Greek schedule and marvel at it from afar. It is so great every season, whereas the schedule really lacks at the outdoor ampitheatres in my neck of the woods because they are so big. In Jersey, I'm stuck going to lots of indoor shows (which, is fine - some live music is better than none at all!) because the artists I listen to just can't sell out 20,000 capacity venues. And, maybe that's a good thing for the fan base they do have. If I lived in the area, I know I'd be going to many, many shows at the Greek. This venue is absolutely worth a visit or two if you are visiting the area, and if you live in southern California, well, lucky you!",Mdgrl79
50,Great!,"I liked it very much. Exciting and wonderful, I discovered a lot of new about this art. Really like. This is so cool !!!!",HAURYLCHYK
50,Great little venue,I love the Greek Theater because there are hardly any back seats. It's small enough that no matter where you sit you'll be able to enjoy the show. The staff is nice and professional. Parking can be a pain though so if you can do park and ride.,NilooG
50,Love the Greek,"I have been attending 8 or more concerts here for the past 11 years. Greatest venue in the Los Angeles area. Good views of the performing acts, sound is excellent and having the picnic basket dinner are the Zeus Bar deck is the way to go. Only thing that could use improvement is the stack parking, there are other options that I suggest you explore.",4EIEIO
50,Pretty good,"Nice outdoor venue in Griffith Park! It is like the Hollywood Bowl but smaller! I personally like the Hollywood Bowl better but here you do not have to have a box to sit super close-up! Great place to watch a concert especially in the first couple of rows (saw Cyndi Lauper there). Had always wondered about this place and yes, I liked it! Horrible food and parking is somewhat of a pain also (less organized than Hollywood Bowl).",traveler4k
50,A wonderful venue,I've had some great concert experiences here - it really is lovely - more intimate than the Hollywood Bowl. The only bad part is the parking as it is stacked and if you are unlucky you can find yourself in a place where you can't get out of for ages. My first foray there took hours to get out of and then of course the clogged streets afterwards. My most recent experience was no problem at all. You can buy more expensive book ahead parking and if you can remember to do that it probably would be worth it. But it is really a magical place.,alisonhk65
40,Great place to see a concert,"The Greek Theater is a great open air place to see a concert in the summer. Similar to the Hollywood Bowl but smaller. Parking is very tough. Once your car is parked, it is locked in aroiund others so plan on staying for a while or take public transportation.",MrStogie
50,"Beautiful Outdoor venue, excellent acts!",Love going to the Greek! Medium size outdoor venue in the hillsof Los Feliz. Excellent acoustics. Only drawback is the stacked parking which can be an enormous hassle when leaving.,paulajeand
50,Fantastic Venue,"I cannot wait to see another show at The Greek Theater! Everything was spectacular! We saw Brian Wilson and Jeff Beck. The sound was great and we noticed that wherever your seats were, they were great! Such a great night!",Faith229
50,The Best Concert Spot,"If you get a chance to see a concert here, any type concert, do not miss it. Wonderful outdoor venue so beautiful. As with anywhere in Los Angeles the parking is bad, prepare ahead and you""ll be fine. We took a town car and that worked very well..",Sarah L
40,Great for summer concerts,"This is a great place to attend concerts in good weather. Big screens so you can see the performers up close from any seat. The traffic flow can be pretty heavy depending on where you park. We get there at least an hour or so early, park in the stacked lot and have a picnic. Then we just walk about a block up the hill to the venue. If you get there late and have to park up the hill and catch the shuttle it can be a pain. The Greek is in a residential area so you definitely have to be gone by 11p.",RhonniH
50,Great,"What else can you say - another Neil Diamond spot, so very pleased that it was included on our bus tour",Ozziechick45
40,Brian Wilson and Jeff Beck at the Greek THeater,"Had a really good experience at the Greek Theater. Even though our seats were off to the side, the view of the stage was great. The concert was fun, even though it was a bit loud for me! Thank goodness brought earplugs.The Greek is a great venue because it is not too small and not giant like so many other venues. Getting in and out with parking is a bit challenging but very doable. The traffic cops keep traffic moving and get you in and out pretty quickly!Would highly recommend a trip to the Greek. You can bring your food with you and eat outside ahead of time. Great date venue!",Needlepointaddict
50,Awesome outdoor concert venue,"What a great place to see a show. Under a full moon and starry sky you enjoy wonderful acoustics and a setting that feels more intimate than 6,000 seats. There isn't a bad seat in the house. The traffic control and parking were well managed. I feared chaos but everyone flowed smoothly in and out which is more than I can say for the rest of L.A. traffic. If you get a chance to arrive before sunset, take a look at the views from the Griffith Observatory and then head off to your show. My only gripes: 1) no quality dining options in the area so plan ahead and 2) the concessions stands made the place smell like McD's.",gfg721
40,My very first concert.....,"....was @ ""the Greek"" in 1972,""CHICAGO"".I've been back many times since.There really isn't a bad seat in the whole place except way up in the front on either side.I made this ""minor mistake"" last time I was there for ""Pretenders"". It would've been better to be further back IN THE MIDDLE than up front on the side [for lots of reasons].All in all , never been to a bad show there but sometimes bands are requested to ""shut it down @ 11pm"".Pretenders played until 11:30,but that's very rare.This might have been their ""final tour"" so I don't think they cared.It was EPIC,they played EVERY GOOD SONG [lots n' lots ! !] except ""Brass in pocket"".One of the top 3 concerts of my life..... [Chrissy ""ROCKS"" !! ...should've been in R & R Hall of Fame, YEARS AGO !]ps this was in 2010",Richard996
50,A year later but still great,"The "" Greek"" is one of those places that every time you get to hear a concert there, you marvel how cool a place it is. The stage is visible from just about every angle, even the so called cheap seats. Sound is right on and crisp. You can actually hear the instruments without distortion. Parking is a bit funky and expensive but it's ok if you just stay calm. The parking crew knows how to handle the car load. The food venues while not outstanding still are ok considering you come for the music , not gourmet treats.I do not get to the Greek too often but love it when I do. The best spot for live music in LA.",Frank G
50,Not a bad seat in the house!,We came from out of town to see a concert here and I would love to go back. There is not a bad seat in this venue and the sound is fantastic. It's so great to be surrounded by the trees. You forget you are just minutes from one of the biggest cities in the U.S.,tuffy26l
40,Favorite place to watch a concert,"I love the Greek Theatre! The sound is great for an outdoor venue, almost evey seat in the house offers a good view of the stage, and it's fun being surrounded by Griffith Park..The tandum parking is no fun, and it can be difficult to walk in the dirt with your high heels on. Aside from that, this is my favorite place to see a concert.",Isunwin

50,Neil Diamond at the Greek,We saw Neil Diamond at the Greek in August of last year. It was the 40th anniversary of his Hot August nights album form 1972. The outdoor theater holds about 6500 people. It is a very intimate venue for a concert. The sound and the light show were fantastic. One of the best places I've been for a concert.,Cujo3131
50,Fun tour,"Got a sneak preview to the remodel. Very nice tour. Great information, entertaining guide. Must see while in Hollywood!",ColoradoNicatraveler
40,Great venue for a show,"Easy to get to, book your parking when you buy your tickets otherwise you might get stuck parking in the last lot (stacked) and then you'll have to wait for others to get out. Aside this, the venue is a great place to see a show. All seats are good, being an amphitheatre, but the best seats are the sides (north or south terrace), with the obstructed view. They are closer, and the obstruction is really not that bad. The seats are made of hard plastic, a cushion might be a good idea, and they even offer hot chocolate among beer, alcohol and water.",MARY K
50,HEART and the Led Zepplin Experience with Jason Bonham,"Couldn't hear the girls over their band instruments.....they were having trouble with that sound system. A disappointment for sure!! :( In spite of this, the Greek is still our absolute favorite outdoor venue.....its clean, well run, organized and staff very friendly and professional.....",Karen S
30,PETER FRAMPTON W/ BB KING,"We were lucky enough to ride my man's Harley so parking was great! Lot F, right by entrance..$10 so not too bad. We arrived and had pre-ordered an ""opening act"" picnic basket and it was there waiting for us which was nice. Seating was pleasant in a patio area where wine is available so we bought a bottle of white. Picnic basket gets a ""C"" pretty average..lots of meat, but no apples, grapes, fresh fruit.. cheap ordinary cheese chunks and raisins, tiny morsels of dried apricots strewn on the bottom of cardboard box which was very weird. I would have gladly traded half the meat for some fresh fruit. Greek salad was average at best. What bothered me most, was we paid $45.00 for this, but later saw we could have ordered from the stand the same food half the price. Next time. They allow no brought in food, but plenty of people do bring their own and eat out front on picnic tables which is a good idea.Was really looking forward to BB, but unfortunately he talked so much, he barely played or sang. He was infatuated with some pretty girl in the front row eating popcorn and that is pretty much all he spoke of the whole concert while strumming his guitar. We were lucky enough to get really part of only one song Thrill is Gone, which was great and the crowd was dying for more music. He sounds great, voice is fantastic for an 87 year old, guitar really good also, just wish we had some ""normal"" song playing without all the Stream of Consciousness chatter. He is charming for sure, but I was disappointed. Peter Frampton joined him which was great and he put on a really great show. His son and Andy Summers joined in. All in all a fun night, nice weather..seats get really hard so bring a pillow!!",JanLosAngeles
50,Perfect spot for a concert.,"Located in Griffin Park this outdoor venue, in a natural bowl is the perfect spot for a concert. Great sight lines and sound system. Parking was a bit of a challenge, but not much you can do about it short of bulldozing and paving, which would be a crime, so wear flats and go with it. Easy access to restrooms and concession areas. We saw Warren Haynes with an orchestra. Big fun!",margo b

50,Entertainment Under the Stars,"The ""Greek"" (as it it called by Angelinos) is far more intimate a venue than the Hollywood Bowl. A wide variety of performers appear (some on an annual basis) and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. Prices vary by location and performance, but if you're in town and someone you like is performing on a night you're here, definitely stop by. As often than not, seats for that evening's performance will be available at the box office 1 to 2 hours before showtime, so avoid the brokers and scalpers. The acoustics are good enough that if you can't get a seat, you can enjoy the music on the lean or at a picnic bench just outside the venue.",Travelwherever

The prices of the beer is way out of line. $11.75, (or was it $12.75?) for a 24oz. Really?. We laughed so hard, we took a picture of the two beers we bought and put it on facebook.",Bill R
50,Excellent Venue,I can see why the loud and explosive bands perform here. It's perfect. You don't hear anything from outside really. And the sound system is incredible. I saw postal service here. There bass heavy bass drum sound was explosive! :) I really liked the show and the venue isn't so big that you feel bad for buying cheap seats! :) It rocks really,Sammy C
50,UNDER THE STARS..MOST INTIMATE CONCERT VENUE IN LA,"THE GREEK is my favorite concert venue in all of LA. WHY? Because it is smaller, more intimate and there is just something magical about listening to great music under the stars. Being one who is not fond of large crowds, It is always the Greek for me. I have the fondest memories of concerts from The Gypsy Kings, Annie Lenox, Frank Sinatra and KD LANG...If you have the opportunity to attend a concert here, you will love it too!",Mary Jean V
50,No such thing as a bad seat here!,"We drove over for a fun weekend to see Barry Manilow here because he is the Showman Extraordinaire, and because we've always wanted to see a concert at this venue. This was a spontaneous thing (and take my word, we're not spontaneous people!) and we would do it again in a heartbeat! Acoustics were great, Barry was his usual, entertaining self, and to see a concert in this outdoor arena was nothing short of spectacular!We got there early 6:30ish for an 8:00 show, and parked in Parking Lot A for $20. We got in and out very quickly. There were people there enjoying picnic baskets with wine on a blanket in the park before the concert who had gotten there at least a 1/2 hour before we did. We researched the Ride and Dine deal, but it seemed pricey considering we could have a gourmet picnic for a fraction of the cost in Parking Lot A.They handed out glow sticks as we walked in.The bathrooms were very clean!My only advice would be to take a blanket to sit on or at least a light jacket because it can get rather chilly in Griffith Park at night.Don't wait any longer, check out the upcoming concerts and go! We had a fantastic time!",dgn5cs
50,Kings of the Mic,Went surprisingly to the Kings of the Mic LLCOOLJ. Ice Cube Public Enemy. Normally not my thing. The weather was great. The Venue is not to big but under the stars. Parking and in and out easy. Had an amazing time,AARDVARKKILLER
40,Barry Manilow was TERRIFIC,"Loved the Greek. Loved the concert. We had great seats. The parking was horrible. We had to stack park quit a distance from the theater and it was an uphill walk. Definitely, not a walk someone with health issues could make easily. After the concert it took forever to get out of the stack parking lot. Shuttle like they have at the Hollywood Bowl would have made it a much more enjoyable experience.",bzhands
50,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"We saw Peter Frampton here last Summer 2012 and it was a great concert. We enjoyed the outdoor air and great music I grew up in.The food options - meh. But we weren't here for the food right.It's one of my favorite past times to enjoy a concert at least once a year. I'm fortunate to be able to do that - I'll never take it for granted. A small task but harder to accomplish sometimes during our hectic, busy lives - and the fact my husband & I live in different states. That's why it's special to go out of our way to enjoy these moments.",Grace M
40,Best Outdoor Theatre in LA,"If you love the outdoors and you love good theater this is the place for you. Great sound, great cast, and overall excellent work from the people at Greek Theatre. There is a shuttle that can take you all the way inside Griffin Park and to the theater. Yet I opted for the 15 dollar parking that is located almost all around the theatre itself. The food was concession stand food but I suppose it is the outdoors. I highly recommend this for any theater lover out there.",Aaron C
50,Best sound quality ever!,"The Greek is a natural setting for a musical performance. The acoustics of the theater are enhanced by the trees ringing the back of the venue. The bathrooms are clean and nice. Get there early so you can park non-stacked parking for 20 dollars. Yes the food and drink is pricey but its quality and its always expensive at a concert setting. You can purchase a bottle of wine fairly reasonably, but pass on the giant margarita for 15 bucks, I think they forgot to put tequila in it. Bring blankets and jackets! It was cool. Relax and enjoy-I just saw Guster, Ben Folds Five and Bare Naked Ladies. It was a great lineup and a fun show.",LindaT2409
50,The Greek Theatre is a California Gem,"If you get the opportunity to see a show - GO! If the weather is nice, with a good show it is the BEST. The parking is a mess that is the downfall. I would suggest you spend the extra $$$$with the Dine & ride program. To sit under the stars with great sound it is a great experience.",SWPerry
50,Such a Lovely Evening at The Greek Theatre,"We attended the Barry Manilow concert at The Greek Theatre. We had what could be called the worst seats in the house, and they were great. It is such an intimate theatre where you can really have a great concert experience, no matter where you sit. The theatre might, quite honestly, have the best bathroom facilities I have ever seen for such a venue.The sound was solidly descent. I think if I have one criticism it would be that they need to upgrade their multimedia system. They have 1 camera, and it stayed on Barry Manilow just about the entire night. I would have liked to have seen images of the band and the dancers, and heck, even the crowd who was SO getting into the music.If you attend, I would strongly recommend that you take advantage of dine & ride. There are a number of restaurants with a prix fixe meal that also includes parking and a shuttle to and from the venue. That is a very well run system, and I would recommend it again.",Janet C
40,"Intimate venue, get centered seats","If you look past the parking, this place is very intimate and has a great concert atmosphere. It's best if you sit in the center, not on the side, and every seat seems to be a good seat if you are centered.I went to see Barry Mallow on Father's Day, and splurged with the Dine and ride program. Worth every penny to avoid the Greek parking.We had dinner at the Dresden, and Dine and ride shuttled us to the Greek and dropped us off right at the front gateI did a review on the Dresden experience, as well as Dine and ride. My seats were in row J in the front part of the theater. It was a little bit to the right, and I realized it was much better if I was more centered, even a little further up.Not sure if I would go to the Greek again, because of the stack parking.

50,Large yet intimate,"The Greek Theater has become my favorite venue for concerts. Even though the theater hold almost 6000 people there realy is no bad seat in the house. The open air and surrounding trees make the Greek feel comfotable and welcoming. Furthermore, seating is comfortable with a fair amount of leg room (important since I'm 6'4""). Also, the acoustics are excellent. Parking can be a little daunting but not to bad; get there early and have a picnic in the surrounding park. Overall, for a LA concert you will not beat the Greek.",Jayson C
50,Excellent venue,"I went to see the concert ""The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Godesses"" and it was one of the best shows I've ever been to. The theater was great, with nice views. Despite being an outdoor theater, the acoustics were great and the weather helped giving a refreshing night.The only cons I can think of is that parking was a little expensive, and the food was also a bit overpriced, despite being very tasty.I would recommend to anyone to visit the theater as long as they are going to watch a show they are interested into.",Sid_LAS_84
30,You'll see it on the way to the Griffith observatory.,"I was a bit dissapointed about this theater. You can not miss it in the way to the observatory but too me it was not worth the stop. Also it is hard to find parking in the area. If you have lots of time you can go inside, otherwise just keep driving to the Griffith Observatory. To me it was not worht the stop.",YEG-AB

50,Great venue,"The ambience of the Greek Theater in Los Angeles can't be beat on a beautiful summer evening. Very romantic. Bring a picnic dinner and find a great spot on the grass areas and enjoy! Don't forget the wine. Come early - parking is not easy and only difficult part of going there. More expensive lots make it easier.If regular parking lots are used, may have to hike quite a bit to get to the front of the theater. Other than that, beautiful! Prepare a slow exit after the show. Lots of cars! Perfect for Johnny Mathis show. Wonderful wonderful!",travelalot32136
50,Love the Greek,Because it's a smaller venue there is hardly a bad seat in the place. The sound quality is great. The only drawback would be the parking but isn't that PITA at any concert venue?,IrishLRose
50,Great Venue,"Love to see concerts here and just wish they would fix the parking so you could get in and out more easily, however it's worth the nuisance to enjoy summertime concerts.",DesHope
30,"Good venue, but lacks control","The Greek offers a good venue for seeing great bands. Parking can be a bit crazy, especially getting out of the venue afterwards. But the acoustics are good and there are video screens for those who sit in the very back. The one big negative is that security is lax and I have yet to go to a concert where some idiots are not lighting up pot and blowing the smoke everywhere. It is nice that the Greek hires blind and deaf security staff, but it would be good if they actually worked during the concert...",Jason F

50,The best outdoor theater in Los Angeles,"When in Los Angeles during the summer, a visit to the Greek Theater for a concert is a must. Select almost any concert as the venue is so spectacular just sitting back and viewing a concert under the Los Angeles evening sky is worth the visit.",Ivan A

50,WAR 92.3 CONCERT,First time to this place. the drive up on a Saturday evening was better then I thought it would be. The parking was right in front- I paid the $20 and it was worth it. Got right out after the concert. The food was good that they sold inside also. Got hooked up with free tickets from Hot 92.3 for this show. Thanks. They also offered all the MJ you could breath in . LOL.,alex n
50,Awesome!,"Ok, so I have to say seeing Crosby, Stills & Nash at The Greek Theatre was the best concert of my life! I went with someone who spent a good part of his life seeing concerts and he absolutely agrees. I just moved to the West coast from Boston, and found it amazing to be walking on hills to get to the theatre. Everyone had energy and were very friendly. We had a great time sitting next to people on both sides of us. The acoustics were top-notch! and this is where ever you sit. The weather was perfect....I'm going to California, a place where the sun always shines. A warm breeze on a star studded night, it was a story to be told, so perfect, so awesome!!!",Chatham382

50,one of the best concert venues anywhere,"This is a beautiful outdoor venue for concerts. Anytime there is a band here I like I make a point to go b/c I love the venue. There can be a lot of traffic getting in and out so allow time. Also there is basic food, but nothing fancy like the Hollywood Bowl.",tripindicular1
30,Interesting outdoor theater,This is an interesting outdoor theater that's not overwhelming. Site lines are not great and you sit far from the stage. An older LA venue with really terrible parking.,traveler1063_12
50,Music,It was my first time at the Greek. I had a great time. My bestfriend and I saw Sugarland for my birthday and they were great!!! The design of the theatre is amazing! I love how they incorporated natures scenery into the foundation of an outdoor theatre.,raven7e
40,Hot August Nights!,"I love this place, it's small enough that you don't feel left out if you aren't in the first seating section. And, getting into and out of it is so much easier than the Hollywood Bowl.",j2garcia
50,Best live music!,I am a sound snob and this venue has consistently pleased my audio demands. I have had the pleasure of sitting in a number of locations for a number of events and have always found the view to be good. Easy access to food/drinks and with dine and ride parking is easy.,JulieD779

50,See a show at the Greek!,The Greek Theatre is famous for its national acts in a festive open air environment. This is a wonderful place to see a show. You sit outside and enjoy the music under the stars. You are surrounded by the forest and hills so it is really beautiful. The acoustics are good and parking isn't too hard to find. Enjoy this classic venue if you can!,CleverCat
50,A Heart concert I'll never forget...,"This place is so cool. It brings together 3 of my favorite things: food, nature, and music! We got a picnic dinner before the show, then enjoyed seeing Heart for the 4th time. It was a beautiful night and it's so nice to be at a concert outdoors where it doesn't take you a million years to leave the parking lot, like some other venues I know...hee hee!",smcrawford38

40,Easy to visit,"The Greek Theatre is very easy to visit, as it is park of Griffith Park. Pop along early to make the most of the huge parks many attractions. Local info will tell you what events are on at any given time. It's a nice place to stop and take a breather when trekking around!",RhiRa
50,My Favorite Music Venue in LA,"Great live music in the California sun, with mountain all around. Some of my best musical experienced, and I've had a lot of them, have come from The Greek. I'll never forget The Flaming lips amazing show there, or Ricky Lee Jone's unrecorded 15 minute ballad that just tore my guts out. The Greek is not to be missed.",Peter H
40,Landmark Concert Venue,The outdoor Greek Theater in Griffith Park is a great concert venue. Small enough to enjoy the concert at close range and large enough to create a real outdoor concert experience. Sight lines are good and sound system excellent. Saw Neil Diamond's 40th Anniversary concert there last fall and it was a thrilling experience. Only negative aspect is the process of leaving after the concert. Rather chaotic departure experience.,BataviaMan1
40,Amazing ambiance,Went there for a Regina Spector concert. It was amazing being able to feel I'm inside a concert hall and outdoors.,GabrielaM2

40,The Hidden Concert Venue,This place has a variety of music. They are open during the summer and closes in the Fall. You wouldn't know it's where it is if you didn't know. You drive down Vermont north which goes straight into the entrance then you drive through a neighborhood of expensive homes and is in what is considered Griffith Park then finally wala you see the theatre on the left. You have no choice of parking so be prepared to pay.,Tacmystery

50,Eek at the Greek,"The Greek is a fantastic place for concerts. Great sound and nice quiet outdoor setting. I went for the Eek at the Greek which featured the Symphony In The Glen with Arthur B Rubinstein. It was a fun and music filled evening with readings of ""The Spider and the Fly"" by Anne-Marie Johnson and ""The Tell Tale Heart"" by Robert Hays. The Greek is the perfect place for an evening of music, from CSN to Symphony in the Glen. The refreshments are a bit high but what isn't at entertainment venues now days. Check out your next concert at the Greek.",Dlowe50
50,Great place to see a concert!,"This is without a doubt our favorite place to attend concerts. You have great accoustics and the great outdoors. The food and drinks are expensive, but we always take a picnic anyway. We have never really had a bad seat, but the heavy wine drinkers around you can get to be a bother - but that's LA.",camrich

I had watched an Il Divo dvd concert here and wanted to see what it would be like. Getting to this theatre and finding parking is a real challenge. Allow yourself lots of time. You park in a dirt field- the attendants were organized but it took a long time to get out. The venue is absolutely wonderful- we had a warm, clear fall evenings and could see stars.",irene w

50,Gerat setting,Went to see Al Green and truly enjoyed the Greek Theatre's ambience. All seats are good. Good selection of food stands to choose from.,ibaol
40,parking is the only drawback,"Whenever we hear a band we like is playing at the Greek, we first get excited because the Greek is a beautiful place to experience music--like the Hollywood Bowl but more intimate and accessible.Then we get disappointed because parking at the Greek is a nightmare. All stacked and in the dust. It takes a very long time to get to your spot, it takes a very long time to walk down to the theatre from your spot, and it takes a very long time to walk back up to your spot, and then it takes a very long time to get out of the theatre area.Once inside the theatre, however, whether you're picking up tickets or already have them, it is a smooth and speedy task. The seating, no matter how high up or off to the side is never that bad. The sound is decent and the band usually looks like they're having a great time.Every so often, take a moment and look around to appreciate the exceptional setting of the theatre in the heart of the rolling hills of Griffith Park.",Lily
50,Romantic and Cozy,"I've been here many times to see concerts. This outdoor venue is romantic, and easy to get to. Just jump off the 101 Freeway, head north on Vermont, and straight into the venue. Yes, there is stacked parking. No biggie. When you get to your car, the person in front of you is at their car too. And so on. There are traffic officers at the bottom of the hill who will hold the light to let all the traffic out. I highly recommend this experience.",JER_1962
30,Unique,"A very unique LA experience. Some of the acts are not well known and they have the dreaded stacked parking so you have to wait to get out. If you like the group it can be fun, but beware it's a younger crowd. Expect to stand up the entire night (3 hours) if you want to see anything since the people in front of you will be. Also the cops do not enforce any marijuana laws. A small beer is $12 and the STACKED parking is $10 to $15",ladinks
50,The Greek,"it has been awhile since i went ot a concert there but Lional Richie was performing , we had seats and to my surprise who was sitting in front of me and my friends was Sally Fields and Gregory Peck , i told you its been awhile , it was alot of fun thoughand even if you don't have seats you can sit on the lawn",April D

40,The Greek,"A great venue for a smaller audience, you are closer to the show, and it seems sorta woodsy, here. The main issue is the terrible parking...yes, it is ""stacked"" parking...otherwise, very nice, very intimate. It is an outdoor arean, so bring a sweater or jacket!",DantheMountainMan
50,Love this place,"The setting is beautiful- in the middle of a park. The sightlines are great, the size and style of the place is perfect. The bathrooms never had much line. Great sounds quality, very nicely run, organized, but easy going. I hope to be back to LA someday just for shows at the Greek!",SWSL
40,"Awesome place for an outdoor concert, but parking stinks","I love a good outdoor concert and the Greek Theatre offers a wonderful variety of artists. The only thing that is really horrible is the stack parking. Many times you have to hike to/from the concert, sometimes in mud, and you have to wait for the crowd before you can depart. Wish they had some public transportation options and/or better parking.",KatPlay

30,Not too Greek and too big for a good show,"In one of the nicest parts of LA: a huge open air theater mainly for music shows. I have been there only once (the Gipsy King) and I had quite contrasting feelings. On the one side I was impressed by the infrastructure itself and by the efficiency of the organization (only in the US it is possible to enjoy such levels of perfection in the show business), on the other I was disappointed by the horrible acoustics: even half way the theater, it was difficult to see the performers and to hear the songs.",giulonragu
50,Greatest Venue in LA,"There is nothing not to like about the Greek, no matter who you hear, what type of music or stage production, this is the place to be. You feel like you are in the middle of a forest, without a bad seat in the house. I've been to more than 20 concerts here and no matter who was playing, would not turn one down!",Laurie M
30,The place has seen better days. Needs to be renovated.,"This place is an L.A. landmark and has seen better days. The tickets to any seat are overpriced and the food is expensive. Go here only if you cannot see your favorite performer in a small, better lit and better acoustic-styled place. Universal Ampitheater is a much better alternative.",SilverLake2TheWorld
30,Outdated outdoor stadium.,"Parking is horrendous and because of the uncomfortable seating, poor bathroom facilities, and the generation gap in choice of musical talent, we have just given up on the Greek.",Evelyn A
40,Nice setting,"We saw Bonnie Raitt and Mavis Staples at The Greek. It's a pretty setting, and it's pretty easy to get in and out of the venue. One warning: if you're in need of accessible seating, make sure they don't put you in Row A. You'll be on the floor level, and if people in front of you stand up, you won't be able to see the stage. Other than that, it was fine.",Susan S
50,Devo & Blondie,"What an amazing venue! When you're at the Greek you don't even feel like you're still in the city what with all the hills & trees surrounding you.Good sound, screens on side of stage was a nice touch, staff were friendly (for the most part). Will be checking their events calendar next time we're in LA/Hollywod.",xcitrusx
50,Amazing Venue,"Came here to see Bonnie Raitt recently. The atmosphere was amazing. Beautiful outdoor venue. I'd say its a slightly smaller version of the Hollywood bowl and both are great venues to see live music. Lighting was perfect, sound was perfect and seats were great. Weather was nice for September. Sat in section B, right center stage. Bring your wine and picnic in the picnic area just outside the venue. Stacked parking was a pain, but luckily we didn't have to wait too long after the show to leave. Good traffic control.",crclk14

50,Fabulous outdoor concerts!,"I've been here a couple of occassions and love the atmosphere. It's perfect for outdoor summer concerts (my favorite was John Legend featuring India.Arie). The Theatre is nestled in the mountains, so the air is refreashing and scenery is lovely. Highly recommended, especially as an intimate venue.",kaykat4533

We arrived early so we did not have to park in the stacked parking area. The food was great and the price was not too bad. They had many options. They also had a bar and beer tasting set up near the entrance. The venue was small so I don't think there are any really bad seats. The bathrooms were clean which is unusual for a concert venue. Sound was great!!! Loved it!",gg345

50,UNREAL venue,"We came from CT to LA to see a concert at The Greek, and were blown away by the event. Yes, 80% of the experience was the concert/performer. But the theater is an intimate venue that is beautifully situated, which makes a concert even better. We had VIP (close in) parking, so I can imagine getting out can be a pain. But I would see ANY concert there, the venue is that great.",jdlvalium

The intimate setting creates a unique bond between performer and audience. Just a perfect place",reichman
50,Community Service,"My son plays saxophone in Middle School and their school Orchestra plays here at the end of the School year. Thanks to the staff and board of the Greek Theater for allowing their local community schools to showcase their talents and have the kids experience a very professional, commercial and educational venue at a young age. Knowing that Whitney Houston performed here in 2006 gives you a feeling of being part of a grand scheme.",KernLADrifter

50,Ride and Dine.,"All the reviews of the Greek Theatre are very accurate. It is an amazing place to see a concert...The parking is a nightmare though. Avoid it at all costs. We went to the Neil Diamond performance on Saturday, August 25th., we made reservations with ""Ride and Dine"". For $100 they provided a fine dinner and drinks at the Rockwell....then took us to the front gate at the Greek. After the concert, they picked us up at the front gate and took us back to the restaurant where our car had been parked.They run a flawless operation and we will definitely use them again.",rbaackers
50,Wonderful venue,"Saw Neil Diamond on August 11, reliving my teen years when Hot August Nights was my favorite album. (""Album?"") Flew in from Philadelphia and had a long fun LA weekend with my husband but he did not want to see Neil. So...I got my very excellent single ticket from stubhub, 5th row center seat. I wore my ND tee shirt and shorts, but many of the people there were dressed very nicely. Lots of limos clogging the main road. My husband, a photographer, went to the observatory to get some beautiful LA sunset and nightscape pix, then returned to pick me up - what a luxury! I had the best time. The theater was beautiful, smaller than I expected. No bad seats in the place. An old-time red velvet curtain across the stage. It was hotter than normal, but when the show opened I forgot how hot it was. The band was great, energy level high. The setlist was pretty standard but it sounded great. I would do it all over again and would love to go to this theater for other concerts.",Joanne J

50,Neil Diamond 40th Annivesary,"We stayed at a hotel just off of Hollywood Blvd., and Orange. I would suggest taking a cab to the theatre, it'll cost about $20.00. We saw our show and then walked down the hill, where you'll find numerous restaurants etc... We caught a cab back to our hotel from there. The theatre open air, cut into the side of a hill, thus creating a bowl effect. The sound and acoustics are good. On a nice night, as we had, can't be beat!",Habmanfoody
40,Awesome Theatre but the Parking is Terrible,"I saw Neil Diamond at the Greek. It's a very intimate theater and provides a wonderful outdoor setting to enjoy concerts. On the down side, the parking situation leaves much to be desired. I went online prior to my event to check out the parking options: the website mentioned that there was $50.00 parking in a preferred lot, $20.00 non-stacked parking and $15.00 stacked parking. I got to the venue over two hours early to ensure that I'd get non-stacked parking. When I got there, they immediately directed us to ""Lot B"" - stacked parking and said no other parking was available. It is very annoying to try to find your car in the dark after the show, not to mention that you're walking on unlevel grass. The parking is not worth the drama, which is unfortunate because it really is a beautiful place for artists to perform.",Diamond-luv

50,This theater is great!,Nice theater in Griffin park. A little chilli at night but I'm not from LA so I know better for next time.,BluesTraveler29
40,Not a bad seat in the house...,"Just went to see Primus and the sound system was great as well as the seating. I will definitely be back there to watch another concert. Let me suggest you do the Dine and Ride. The traffic getting out of there was atrocious, but since we were being shuttled, it was very quick and painless.",shelngav
50,favorite concert venue,"We try to go at least once a season. The atmosphere is wonderful and can't be beat on a beautiful summer nite. The roster always offers something you want to see. Love picniking first with friends on the grounds. Seeing Bonnie Raitt later this summer can't wait but have seen Al Green, Lyle Lovett, Donna Summer, Four Tops, varied jazz greats, Gypsy Kings over the years..many more. LOVE IT",janieB1123
50,Best Outdoor Concert Venue In The U.S.,The Greek is a terrific place to see a show and even the back row provides a good view of the stage. The only downside is the parking lot which can be a challenge. It's in a park like atmosphere in the LA hills that makes you forget that you are in the megapolis.,PstarTraveler

40,Great place to see a show-but OH the parking,"Beautiful outdoor venue. It is a great way to see a any type of music show because the weather here is nearly always comfortable. The acoustics are right so you can hear well even on the remote sets. Large screens give a close up view of the performer, which is just fine for me. Sorry but you can't bring outside food...but the food inside is pretty good! Please enjoy it even more by trying one of the shuttles or alternative routes because parking here is usually chaos.",Tamale624

40,Great venue for concerts,"This is a great venue for concerts. Great sound. More intimate than the Hollywood Bowl, and more seats up front.Avoid the traffic and go early to picnic. Stacked parking, so try not to be too far back in a line.",SoCalTraveler91356
50,Ambiance of the Outdoor Theater,"No matter who is appearing, one of the funnest aspects of the Greek Theater is the outdoor ambiance while being entertained - Ya gotta love it. Choose the artist you want to see and go and enjoy every aspect of the evening!",twoonthego70
40,Great Venue,This is such a nice concert space. Great sound and no bad seats. We used the dine and ride service so parking was not an issue. It was a little cold the night we went so bring a jacket.,JW_LW
50,Beautiful!,Love this venue! Outdoors are amazing and acoustics are great too.,Joy J
40,"as good as the Hollywood Bowl, but smaller","I like this venue for its size - not as big as the Bowl, which makes for more intimate shows. it's set among the trees of Griffith Park so it's a really nice outdoor amphitheatre. sound isn't as good as the Bowl, and parking is different and the food options aren't as good. But a great mid-size venue to see a show during the summer.",filmlaw
30,A Big Open-air Venue,"Excellent sound system, excellent lighting, huge audience area. But you are sitting outdoors, which means you are subject to the weather. Thankfully, L.A. Weather is usually very nice in the summer, but can be HOT in the late afternoon or early evening, and then get CHILLY during a performance. So bring all kinds of coats & sweaters. And while the FAA requests pilots to avoide the area during shows, some airplanes still fly overhead. And if the police nead a helicopter over a nearby neighborhood, then you hear it too, Note: The original 'band shell' has a similar design as the Hollywood Bowl. The Greek-themed 'portico' over the front is a fairly new addition.",Ralph K
50,on maybe the best small open air venue ever!,"very small, natural ampitheatre, great for intimate singers...seen and loved Tony Bennet, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor and others there..one of my favorite places.",Mayalavender
50,The Best Concert Venue in America.,"Arguably the best venue in America. The sound system can be dodgy at times but the seating is intimate and the surroundings are beautiful.Most every season there is at least one show for most musical taste.Bring a sweater as the seats are not padded and it gets really cold in the mountains at night. As you exit a later evening show, look to the right as there are often deer hanging out.The Redwood Deck is also a very cool place to hang out and party if one is lucky, or connected, enough to score Backstage Access.",Bentheredunthat

50,Incredible Museum,"Too much to see in a single visit so spend some time reviewing the map before you begin your tour. The museum is made up of several buildings, each of which holds many great masterpieces.",Megan C
40,Parking a pain.,Have seen some great concerts at this facility. I always hesitate to go there because of the parking which is really bad. If you want your car parked where you can exit easily it will cost quite a bit. The atmosphere is really beautiful once you go through the hassle of driving up the hill and parking.,trip_lady15
40,Great place to see a show,Small venue where all seats are great seats. Only drawback is the 10pm shut down time becaquse it is in a rsidential area. tough to park too.,King J
50,The romantic Greek Theatre,"My husband and I have been going for years. We park in the neighborhood and hike up the hill with picnic consumed in the car so we don't need to tote anything. Acoustics are excellent, artists are top-notch, and nothing beats the Greek for romantic evening.",SukiKunitz

50,An Excellent Venue for an Open Air Performance of almost any kind!,"You just have to experience this venue to appreciate it. But you'll have to do your homework first to discover what's going to be happening there. I personnally have not been back for a while, as I'm spending more time supporting local events in the South Bay area of LA County, but if you do your homework, and attend an event at the Greek Theater, I think you will see what I mean.",amercorp

50,Awesome place to watch a concert,"The Greek is a classic L.A. outdoor theater. I have seen many famous bands play here and they have always been magical experiences. If you can catch a show at the Greek, go for it. Just being outside at this lovely theater is an experience in itself.",Beau S
50,the best outdoor concert venue in LA,"if you have the opportunity to see a performance here, take it. Bring your picnic - go early for good parking and chillax at this one of a kind venue",NeeceeD
50,Yet another hidden gem in LA,"There is not a bad seat in the house at the Greek. Every year their concert choices are very diverse. I love the surroundings Giffith Park. You can picnic before the shows. Parking is the only downside. If you can walk the best is to park down below on Los Feliz and do the hike, if not just know it's stacked parking like the Hollywood Bowl. Happy Show to all!",PineappleShagette
50,Attend and Enjoy,"Built into the cup of a hill in Griffith Park, you can see the stage, you can hear what's going on, and if you tire of the act you can watch the stars in the sky and the occasional skunk strolling down the aisle. This is the perfect summer date, the air gets cool enough to make you cuddle, bringing a picnic and a blanket is completely acceptable, and your fellow concert attendees are just as happy as you are to be in this beautiful spot. This is a very nice house for any act from singers to musicals.",CarpBooksFan
50,"Pretty Setting, Old School Design & Intimacy Make it a Great Venue","This is NOT a huge outdoor theatre and it is an older building but it is a great place to see a concert! In fact I'm pretty sure it was recently voted as being one of the top places to see an outdoor concert in the US. I've been to quite a few concerts here and have had different seats but they were all good because it's an intimate ( for an outdoor venue ) theatre and you can really ""see"" from anywhere. I would suggest trying to get the most expensive parking pass possible BEFORE the event if they are still available though, because the only drawback is that it could take a while to get to your car afterwards because when this theatre was built it wasn't built for the number and size of cars of today. Still, I wouldn't let parking keep you from going - when you really want to feel like you can actually see the performers well in an outdoor setting - this is the place to go.",thewindatourfeet
40,A Night at the Greek.,"I recently took my 11-year old son to see Cheap Trick perform Dream Police at The Greek. It was a excellent night. It's an open air venue and the weather was perfect. The band sounded great. Near stage seating certainly helped too. One thing - the sound at the stage level is a bit muddy. And for those with hearing issues, I'd suggest seats at the 2nd level.",MrDibbs90712
40,Fantastic Outdoor Venue for Live Music,"The Greek is one of the best outdoor venues for music. Almost every seat is a great seat . . . The sound is probably better up on top in the cheap seats than up close. The best way to enjoy the evening is to get there early, bring a picnic basket, drinks and chill with friends or your date. There are plenty of tables under trees in the beautiful Hollywood hills . . . Enjoy your meal, your company, then head out to an evening of music.",Robert A

50,What an amazing venue,Love seeing shows at the Greek in LA. Try to get to a show if you are visiting the area. You get a great view of the LA skyline from most seats.,Marnsala
50,one complaint,"as far as a venue goes, this is fantastic. Come VERY early and pay for the VIP parking. It is impossible to get in and out of the venue, parking is horrible, but it can be avoided if you go early and park in the VIP lot. Its more expensive but personally I think its worth paying to not sit in your car for 3 hours.",ktmonster
40,Great area to visit...,Enjoy a performance if one is available (not till March 2012 for current season). Parking runs $15 - $20 average and still requires some walking.,B J

50,Romantic Outdoor Concert Hall,"I have seen 3 concerts here and they were all wonderful. I remember how fun it was coming here as a kid with my parents and picnicking before the show and how romantic it was later in life when I came here with a boyfriend, listening to good music under the moon, in an area that is carved out in the hills, surrounded by beautiful trees. A lovely, lovely place to go on a date!",cmdevenney
50,Awesome outdoor theater,"There is nothing to compare to seeing a concert outside at the greek theatre. No bad seats. The only negative last time there is you had to leave thru the park which wasvery intimidating,curvy dark drive.So if you dont do mountain type driving check before you go and see about the exit.",HoosierHeart

40,Uniquely Southern California,"The Greek is SO old-fashioned, like the local ""band shell"" I used to go to when I was a kid on the east coast. Mixed quality of performers, from the AMAZING to the YOU MUST BE KIDDING. Remember that some performers are not ""booked"" by the venue. They buy an open night and then produce whatever show they want to. Same thing happens at the Hollywood Bowl, but usually featuring a superstar like Cher in one of her endless ""farewell tours."" Everyone should go to the Greek at least once. No boxes for you swells. Actually, there are a couple of corporate faux boxes, but the Hollywood Bowl it ain't.",LATraveller77

40,Excellent Venue for Concerts,"I went to see Celtic Thunder at the Greek (outstanding performance). The Greek Theater is a very nice outdoor venue (I had last been there in the 80s for some Bette Midler concerts). Parking is always boo-hooed by reviewers, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was well organized, and we got ""out of there"" fairly quickly after the concert (and with a full house of concert-goers). Concessions are expensive and I wish they would allow one to bring in beverages a la Hollywood Bowl. A simple soft drink is $4.95. The one item that might be worth the cost is a bottle of wine for $22, but I don't know what wine label they were selling. The acoustics are really good, except that there was some static when one of the musician was playing a solo flute - the sound system could not handle the flute's register without static, surprising for a venue like this. Other than that little sound issue, the system was outstanding. Seats are fairly comfortable and, since the theater is not huge, even the cheaper seats probably have great viewing/sound (we were in Section A and it was perfect seating). Bathroom facilities were more than adequate and quite clean.",FrequentTraveller034
40,"Bright stars, Bright Lights, I would love to see.","The concert was outdoors, seating, and stage big... people who want to stand can buy tixs. to do just that stand and dance all the whole concert.

50,Amazing Venue,"I loved this venue! What an amazing outdoor scape, especially for Los Angeles, where the city feels just about impossible to escape.

There is not a bad seat in the 5800 seat house, even the cheap seats have great sound.Bring a sweater, it can be chilly after sunset. Food and drinks are sold at several kiosks. Several area restaurants have shuttle service to and from the concerts, check the Greek Theater website for more information.",HappySurfer
