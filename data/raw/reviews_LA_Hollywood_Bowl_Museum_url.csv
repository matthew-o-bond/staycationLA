50,An LA staple,"If you visit LA, you must see a concert at the Bowl. I have seen ""small"" shows like Rodrigo y Gabriela here, and huge shows like Coldplay. The cool thing is, for small shows, you can bring your own picnic and wine. That's right... No need to pay for overpriced booze at the venue. But that does not apply for the larger shows... Be prepared to drop a pretty penny for booze. The sound quality has been great at every concert I have attended here, and the experience just feels quintesentially LA.",Kristen R
50,Rite of Passage-one must go to an event at the Hollywood Bowl!,I have been going to the Hollywood Bowl since I was young. I think one of my favorite events is when they do the Sing-Along. I remember going to many of the Sound of Music Sing-Alongs and it was crazy fun!!! There are FABULOUS shows here every season. Take a picnic! Buy box seats if you can.,adrienne500

50,Great place to see a concert!,"Parking isn't too bad and it's a long hike to get to the stage, but there's plenty of accommodation for you to get there if you have difficulty doing so. Once you get to your seat you will find it hard and a bit uncomfortable, as they are long benches, but it is worth it! You get a bit of Hollywood history and a great show at the same time!",ibhayhay
40,If you don't get reasonably close seats you will not see the stage. Fun place,My daughter's first concert to see Kidz Bop! and then Little Mermaid live! We go occasionally. Best time to go is in the summer. Get the tickets that come with the Waitress service its nice to sit and have the food delivered. Old place but you will have fun. Note: Also buy the cushions to sit comfortably.,andreanicu

20,Hollywood Bowl Museum,"The Hollywood Bowl is amazing to see and the museum is very small and I was hoping it would offer more. It's free but you have to find a parking space if you travel by car. Also, the gift store the museum offers is minimal so that is disappointing. I was expecting more and the Hollywood Bowl does offer a gift store but it's only open during events.During my visit I couldn't walk in to see the Hollywood Bowl because it was closed for private events (like concerts) but normally it's supposed to be open to the general public.If you have time to kill and in the area you could check this out but if you miss it you're really not missing much. I would visit when I can see the Hollywood Bowl and not close to the general public.",MichaelLong1963

40,Never knew it was there....,"A big Thank You to the Friends of the LA PHIL who invited us to the Museum and a tour of the Hollywood Bowl. I would never known that this small museum was located on the grounds of the Bowl and whenever there is to be a concert that evening, the museum is open. Traffic was deadly on Wednesday morning. I mean a crash with fatalities miles away caused the entire 405, 5, 101, and 110 triangle to be dry slow. Adding an hour to the commute. The guide was very knowledgeable about the contents, allow one hour to see both down and upstairs. A lot of music has been recorded and is available for you to listen to. I most enjoyed Stravinsky conducting Stravinsky from 1961. Scenes from movies filmed at the Bowl are shown on a TV. I liked Frank Sinatra, standing at the top, above the bench seats, and sliding down the bare dirt trail to gain a free entry, all the while wearing his Navy uniform. A history of the Bowl and its various “shells” is there to look at and be explained. Things you have never really thought about, now we know more.",James Weaver
20,Andrea Bocelli,"If you must see something at this venue do one of the following: arrive at least one hour before doors open, book a hotel within walking distance or have something set up to be bused in and leave your car at an outlying lot. Never experienced gridlocked traffic before and I’ve lived in SoCal for over 20 years, but I did trying to get to Hollywood Bowl before and after this sold out performance. The crowds were insane, I felt like a sardine on the benches in section M and we ended up having an near confrontation with a homeless dude afterwards that my daughter was kinda disturbed by. I am going to steer clear of this venue in the future.",Brian Janey
50,A Summer Must!,The Bowl has a great list of performances all summer long. Check the website and pick something that appeals to you--it is a varied program.

There is a self walking tour experience with boards outlining some of the main features and attractions.The museum opens at 10am and there is just no one there, no lines to wait in and the car park is empty. Parking is in Lot A entering at the fountain off N Highland and Pat Moore. Parking is free, entry is free! It’s a great stop for music lovers.

It is quite crowded getting in and out, which is expected. But just so you plan ahead and be prepared. The food/drink situation needs to be better. You basically need to eat/drink before the show and also make sure you use the bathroom on your way to your seats. My husband waited in line for each of these and pretty much missed half the show. Overall a great experience, but if you know these things ahead of time it will be a much better experience overall.",z272018

40,An annual lineup of amazing shows : Something for everyone!,"The Bowl is an LA icon, and for good reason.Some of the best live performances in the city happen at this incredible venue.Going to an event at this amphitheater is truly a great experience.One of the Bowl's best features is its beautiful location in LA's Hollywood Hills, just below Mulholland Drive and adjacent to Highland Avenue and the 101 freeway.One of The Bowl's worst features is that this special location causes gridlock traffic.If you can possibly avoid driving here, you will be doing yourself a huge favor.That said, this is LA, so asking people take public transportation or, worse, walk, simply goes against the grain of another somewhat unique aspect of LA : our love affair with our cars.We hate the traffic, but we insist on driving our our car, so there you have it : lots of traffic : especially in and around special events [ like a great concert at The Bowl ].So wrap your arms around the LA culture of lots of cars 24/7/365, plan ahead with that in mind, and you will have the such a terrific evening at The Hollywood Bowl!",MLLCLA

50,"Music, Food, and Culture lovers always welcome.","There's always music at the Hollywood bowl, if you don't want to tote a cooler filled with noms and libations the HB offers a plethora of outlets to acquire noms and libations. Bring a blanket to either sit on or wrap around yourself when it gets chilly. Smokers have designated areas to partake of tobacco and vapes, escalators abound to get you closer to your seat, staff are very helpful to direct you to whatever you need. Parking is a challenge so I'd recommend taking the Red Line, exit on Hollywood and Highland and walk up about half a mile to the Bowl or get a reservation for a shuttle and shuttle back and forth. There are lots of vendors so bring some cash to buy flower crowns that light up, T-shirts, and bacon wrapped hot dogs on your way out. All in all the Bowl is an excellent experience.",J K

40,Lauryn Hill & Dave Chappelle - No cellphones,"First, let me start off by saying that this is a nice outdoor location to see a show at night during the summer. However, it was crowded and the Lauryn Hill & Dave Chappelle show was sold out. We bought tickets shortly after they went on sale just so we could get decent seats in the middle (N1). Luckily there are two large screens on the side so we could view the show on them.We decided to park for free at the LA Zoo and take the shuttle to the hollywood bowl. It took us 1hour and 15 minutes to get there even though we arrived 45 minutes before the show started. Once there, the crowd was big and moving slow because cell phones were not allowed for Dave Chappelle's comedy act. Everyone (and I do mean everyone) has a cellphone so they had to stop and put it in a magnetic bag from yondr. Afterwards, we had to go through security before finally getting in. Some people also came with roller bags for food, drink and etc so it slowed the line down a little also.The atmosphere was hyped and everybody was friendly and ready to party. Dave Chappelle was kinda funny and had everybody laughing. But, everyone was rushing to get their phones bags unlocked after his show so it was shoulder to shoulder for a while. Thankfully they had multiple people and locations to unlock the bags.Lauryn Hill was ok but she changed her songs a little so it was hard to sing along. After the first few songs even the drunks sat down cause they couldn't find the beat. But what annoyed me was that a panel behind her was showing videos and the very middle panel was off so it was distorted.After the show we thought we had to go to the left to exit so we went against the crowd and ended up at the back of the parking lot and had to walk down that hill through the cars to the buses. I would not recommend parking there since it is stacked and people walk in between the cars. The left exit is also going down a steep hill and some women took off their heels and walked - Really! Just Nasty. So make sure to wear comfortable clothes and comfortable shoes.The ride back to the LA Zoo was relaxing and we were able to get in our car and leave right away. All in all, I really enjoyed myself and would hesitate to come back again.",Exquize
40,Sound of Music Sing-a-long,"Had so much fun at The Hollywood Bowl last evening for the Sound of Music sing along. Great venue, with lots of hills to climb to get to your seats. Wear your walking shoes and leave the heels at home! The annual Sound of music event is a lot of fun, complete with audience participation. Dress up as your favorite character, or as your 'favorite thing.' Pack a picnic and get there early, as there are many areas to picnic prior to the show. The only downfall or complaint is the nightmarish parking situation. Grab a cab, uber or Lyft for an easy exit.",Elizabeethan
50,Best summer nights in Los Angeles,"If you are traveling to Los Angeles during the summer months try to make reservations at this wonderful venue. Nothing is better than spending an evening outdoors in the heart of Hollywood enjoying first class music. I recommend you go early and have dinner inside the park, visit the museum, get a seat cushion and spend the rest of the evening at the concert. I can't think of a better way to spend a night in Los Angeles as you gaze at the stars while listening to music.",A C
40,Bit of a privilege!,"Visited the Hollywood bowl for a bit of a look round. Well worth it.you can just turn up for a wander but there are random people sitting at desks under umbrellas around the place asking what you want. We just said we wanted a wander round and they said ok!! We went on Thursday am and by chance the L A philharmonic practice on Thursday am. Bit of a privilege to watch them for free doing some Mozart. Got to say though that the volunteers looking after them were a bit precious, must sit here, no pics, no talking etc.When they finished we walked to the back of the place and you can see the Hollywood sign. The place is showing it’s age. Very nice museum( free) about the history of the place and who has played there. 2 hours well spent. P S despite many cafes, restaurants etc absolutely nothing is open during the day.",Ian L
40,Great Experience,"There are tens of thousands of people here, so if you don't like crowds, I don't recommend it. But if you do, this is a great LA experience; to see a show out in the open in the evening. Really nice atmosphere. It's LA, so it's a pretty chill crowd. It drops into the 50s when the sun goes down so bring a light jacket. Security is top notch. The food is not good and expensive. We ubered here -just as well - because when we were leaving, it was intense and can bring on some claustrophobia just because of the sheer numbers. Tons of cars trying to leave the car parks... We walked down to Sunset blvd and ordered an uber.",encouragement8
50,Stunning!,Love to go to Hollywood bowl for concert! Do not try to park close the site though... better use one of the Park and Pay Shuttle. Much easier to leave the site after the concert. Very crowded but it is part of the game. Wine bar offers a nice terrace with good food. A must!,MichelAlbert
30,Cant see anything when you sit far,I love this place but you cannot see anything if you see far. Yes it is a beautiful location and a lot of great performers were there but I wouldnt go there again because you cant be up close unless you pay a lot of money.,masha1810
50,Hollywood Bowl is Spectacular!,"We attended a concert one night while staying in LA. We saw Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins and Christopher Cross. It was a beautiful California night, the music as great and the atmosphere incredible. I've had this on my bucket list every since I was a little girl and used to see it in the movies. You can take food and even wine in for concerts and that is something we obviously didn't know. We paid around $70 per person which isn't a bad price. I'm not sure if we will ever get back there so it was quite the highlight of our trip.",Megson310

50,World's Greatest Outdoor Venue? We think so.,"Having see some stellar artists at the hollywood bowl, there are many things to recommend it. It's a true fan's-fan experience. Everyone there is there because they love the artist you're seeing just as much as you do. No rowdy drunks, no jerks in our experience. We are always about 1/2 way up the bowl, giving you a great view of the stage and the surroundings. The sound quality is terrific. Paul Simon playing solo acoustic version of the sound of silence felt like you were in the living room. Yet the high energy performers like Peter Gabriel are clear, distortion free power. All under a clear California Sky. Still there are some challenges. 1) park elsewhere, shuttle or walk in.. the weather's nice, it won't hurt. 2) Rent a cushion. It's only a They pick them up later, so you don't have to. 3) Sit with your glass of wine, looking up at the Hollywood Sign as the sun sinks and the show gets ready to begin. I promise, you will never wish you were anywhere else.",WesSDCA
50,Fun Night !!,"We went on a nice night in August 2018 …. being from New England it seems like all nights are nice in LA !! The LA Phil performed, but the finale they brought out the brass section of USC marching band and played to a barrage of synchronized fireworks - AWESOME !!The only drawback is all the uphill steps to get to your seats .. but after all it is a bowl. That said if I lived closer I would be a regular. We have lots of outdoor venues in the East - and this top notch - almost as good as Tanglewood",old-man-orange
50,Great Little Free Miseum at the Bowl,"If you're at all interested in the architecture or history of the Hollywood Bowl this is worth a visit. Definitely if you're going to the Bowl for a concert stop in before, it's open up until showtime. You can do it in about a half hour, longer if you want to listen to the many live recordings scattered throughout. Don't miss the jazz section upstairs, which punctuates how instrumental, pun intended, was in the growth of jazz. You can take photos inside.",kimo213
40,Great venue - AWFUL PARKING - AWFUL FOOD,Gorgeous venue for a night time concert ! Great views - great feeling in the air. Majestic!!!!!Parking is terrible! Getting to and from is a miserable experience.Food was terribly over priced and poor quality. We tried 3 different vendors.,Phil G
50,A must visit - a true LA experience,"During the Spring/Summer season it's a rite of passage to pack a picnic supper and sit outside to take in a concert. Music offered varies from classical to pop to movie night sing-alongs, so there is something for everyone. The cheap seats at the very top are a bargain, and with the huge video screens you can see what's happening on stage pretty well. Or splurge for seats in the orchestra, or even more fun a box. Be aware that shows not hosted by LA Philharmonic have different rules about bringing in outside wine and food, so do check before hauling it all there. Also, be prepared to do a lot of walking, up a steep hill to get inside the Bowl facility. On the way home, it's easy - all downhill! There are also onsite concessions to buy food, desserts, and wine if you don't have time to make and pack a picnic. Beware of bees that hover around the picnic areas. Don't swat, just leave them alone, and they usually leave you alone too. Or put out a plate of cold cuts or a glass of juice nearby and that will draw them away.",highlandbride
50,great experience,went to see jaws in concert in july and it was awsome great atmosphere and lovely night out with the setting sun dimming as the concert with film started. a few stairs to climb if at the back but worth the climb as the views are breathtaking with the hollwood sign directly behind the stage . so relaxing and chilled out. another los angeles experience with the wow factor,selky
50,Bring your wine and glasses,"It's such an event to go to a concert there. It was a must-do on our trip to LA and it didn't disappoint. Beautiful weather and great concert by the LA Symphony.

I highly recommend you see one concert here.,Darth Amador

30,Museum is pretty small,This is a review of just the museum and grounds. I did not see a show here.The museum is pretty small. It's free but its mostly just vignettes of people who have played the Bowl over the years and some light history on the bowl. I was under the impression there was more to see so I made the trek out to there but it was in and out of the museum in about 30 minutes.I got to wander around the Bowl venue for a bit. They were preparing for a show that night but let me into the concert area just to snap a few pix. I would love to see a show here someday. Next visit to LA!,Stacy C
50,Best Place to see a Concert!!,"Like I said, the Hollywood Bowl is the best place to see a concert. Years ago, my date and I got stuck in the rain while seeing the band Chicago. The concert was cancelled due to the lightening. Regardless, I try to get there once every yearto see somebody because it is a great venue. Pay the money and delight in the experience.",Victoria B
50,The Absolute Best Place in L.A. for Music,"Where to begin...is it with the wonderful vibe that permeates the entire space when people gather to see a concert there? Or, is it the fact that the music sounds amazing from every seat in the place? Or, perhaps, it is that the venue is just the right size for an evening that feels almost intimate (at least compared to stadiums and arenas in the area). We generally sit in the box seats or in the Super Seats now, but years ago, when we were all younger, we sat in the nosebleed section. It doesn't seem to matter, it all sounds the same. The pre-show service in the box seats is pretty good. When we don't do box service, our favorite place to grab small plates and wine at the Bowl is the Wine Bar. The food is all small plates, and truly it is hit and miss. Some of the items are very very rich (heavy on the cheese and cream), but do pair nicely with some of the wines. The wine selection is also pretty hit and miss, but we always find something that we like. We just love that spot for the communal feel at the long tables or the wrap around little shelf for people watching, and hanging out leisurely.Just a quick note about after the shows...because parking is such a nightmare, and it takes a while to get out of the lot, it is better to take your time leaving your seat, hit the bathroom, and then go to your car (if you are parked in the Bowl lots). That way, you aren't sitting in your car frustrated that no one is moving.",Leslie R
50,My FAVORITE Concert Venue in the World,"There simply is nothing else like the Hollywood Bowl. The history, the views, the atmosphere - I wish TripAdvisor would have an entry for the bowl as a venue (not just a museum).We went for Independence Day and had good seats. Wifi is available and screens are viewable from even the furthest of seats to see up close. We brought our own wine and ate at the Bowl. Consider bringing a light jacket as it can get cool once the sun sets behind the mountains.A very enjoyable time. I cannot wait to do this again.",Michael M
40,Beautiful Music,"If you enjoy peaceful music in romantic moonlight, with the most beautiful sounds you have ever heard, then you want to go to the Hollywood Bowl. You can go early, bring your picnic basket and enjoy the day or arrive right before the show in the evening. I would suggest not driving there as it takes a long time to get out after the show is over. Almost all surrounding cities have buses that will take you round trip for a small fee.",hotel10001
50,"Tonight, Tonight, Won't Be Just Any Night: Dudamel & LA Phil doing Pops (Bernstein)","This review has nothing to do with the museum. We haven't made it yet. I'm sure it's 5-star all the way. This is a concert evening review placed in this location because I couldn't find a Trip Advisor entry for the venue itself.Thanks to our enthusiastic and generous LA cousins, this was our 5th visit to the Bowl. We've previously done an all PM Playboy Jazz Fest, a Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame installation, and 3 concerts more on popular music of one kind or another.This concert of classical and show music with the LA Phil was our favorite so far. It felt like what the bowl was really made for.Our concert started off with a couple of really serious modern classical works that provided great opportunities for soloists and the orchestra. The remainder of the concert was show music from ""On the Town,"" ""Wonderful Town,"" ""West Side Story."" Vocalists Sutton Foster and Brian Stokes provided a great show. I've never heard of either and hope that I do again. I confess that I might be a little enamoured of Ms Foster. Whew! Did I say that all the music was really great?The Hollywood Bowl environmentals enhance the magic. Early on, the California brown hills in the background; the hot day turning into a mild evening with a light dry breeze, the searchlights not moving but coming from the two sides and crossing overhead, the big displays that make it possible for all 17,500 of us to catch the nuances and facial expressions (talk about Dudamel and facial!!) on stage, the big lights that change the mood inside the shell to blue or red or some other mood, the truly great sound system that is totally unobtrusive and accurately presents the sound as if you were in a much small hall (is this the best sound system in the world?), and on and on.We do hope for many more Bowl experiences and would love having another classical/pops experience w Dudamel and the LAPhil. Truly magic.As others have said, parking is a challenge. Perhaps one else has really mentioned, I might recommend coming and going with Lyft or Uber. The Bowl has really made a commitment to Lyft, particularly, and has optimized the user experience and traffic flow for that service. If you can come in via Lyft from home or some intermediate parking place, that would be slick.",Richard_StL
30,"Beautiful stadium, horrid parking","You need to arrive here hours in advance if you want to park at the stadium and have it easy. Otherwise I strongly recommend a shuttle. Next best option is parking in the Dolby Theatre Parking lot about a mile away, it takes about 10 minutes to walk to the Bowl and the parking rates are much cheaper than you will pay anywhere else and your car will feel safe.The stadium itself is beautiful and magical at night. I saw Beauty and the Beast live here and sat in section D which is towards the front. This is the ideal spot because it is easy to exit to the food areas and leave as well as close views of the performers without paying an outrageous price. Sit much further back and you won't be able to see the stage, you will be watching your concert on the TV monitors.Its a small hike up the hill to the stadium, wear good shoes and be prepared to pay crazy prices for food. A bag of graham crackers cost me $9.00, and the staff isn't too helpful. When someone was sitting in my assigned seat it took the manager almost 40 minutes to get them to move, to me this is unacceptable. Also another team member didn't know where the bathrooms were.But this stadium is famous in movies and the atmosphere overall is nice and is worth trying once if you are in L.A.",Ashley S
20,Andrea Bocelli’s Concrete,"The Mangment and whoever is in charge of the parking area are not good and handle a sold out event very poorly!I barely give anybody 2 star review in the past so many years and have over 100 reviews but this event management well deserve it.We came in about 2 hours early to be on time for Andrea Bocelli's concert and couldn't make inside till 9:30 while the concerts started at 8 pm.After staying in the Trafic line to get to the Hollywood Bowl parking area for 1:45 minutes in 1 mile distance, when we got to the front to go inside they re route us to another parking 2 Miles away on the top the hills. And that parking was almost full as well.Anyhow as far as the concert goes and for the portions that we saw it was fantastic.For the popular concert like this you should get here really early and try to park away from the event and walk with comfortable shoes and closing since this is a outdoor seating anyways.",Ed A
50,Remembering,The museum was very interesting and very well done. Lots of parking available. It was a very emotional experience for us. I would definitely recommend this museum.,Helen And John P
50,Best Summer Concerts,"When in Los Angeles in the summer you MUST see a concert at the bowl. While parking is a challenge everything else is an experience to remember. Picnic before the concert or eat at one of the 3 restaurants they have on site.. be sure to make reservations if that is your game plan. Many restaurants in Los Angeles have Bowl dinners that they create. You can order in advance pick up on the way to the bowl and enjoy a gourmet picnic with wine and all. Then listen to one of your favorite artists, the LA Phil or join a gang of friends to watch a classic movie with live orchestra. Fantasia, Sound of Music.. last year was Harry Potter.. It is always a great way to spend an evening!",Kiks
50,It's a different experience each time.,I love this place. Every time I go I experience something different. I make new memories. I can feel the energy of the many artists that have performed there over the years. I can't wait to attend the summer concerts each and every year.,795sonjam
40,The Playboy Jazz Festival 2018,"What a lovely venue for a music concert. The place is shaped just like a bowl so wear comfortable shoes because walking up and down steep hills is a required. Bring your rolling bags and coolers and sunhats! To avoid having to carry a lot in my backpack, I ordered a tasty salmon picnic lunch online and my request to switch out the desert selection was honored! The price was worth it. The venue has big screens so it did not seem that there was a bad seat in the house. When facing the stage, the seats to the left have the most shaded area. I selected stacked parking which means its pricey and you can't leave until the show is over, but there are other parking selections available. It was a lovely time.",Boogle47
50,Brilliant venue,"We did not go to the Hollywood Bowl museum but did attend a concert in the evening at the Hollywood Bowl. Fabulous venue with great sound and it just feels great being there. There is something magical about that place. The food was terrible and very expensive. We got burgers and chips. I recommend you order something different. We parked near Capital records and walked; when we saw the traffic we were so glad we did. Parking cost us $20usd for all night. Seat cushions are available for $1 to hire, great idea and well worth it. Some steep hills to walk but well worth it. I can't wait to have an excuse to go again. Next time I will allow extra hours to have a picnic with our own food and take in the surroundings before the show.Highly recommend Hollywood Bowl for a concert.",ozeire
50,Playboy Jazz Festival 2018,"My experience at the Hollywood Bowl is always a great experience. I have been to the last 5 Playboy Jazz festivals at the Bowl and every time is wonderful. There are a few things I would change, like more box meal venders instead of the restaurants overpriced seafood or barbecue platers ($120 and $98 + tax respectively) priced as 4star quality but ended up at around 2star. But that would be it. Staff was helpful, place was clean, and everyone enjoyed the inebriated atmosphere. Not a place for children. For those who just love to bring their kids to everything they do, this is for adults, not children. Don't be upset if adults are doing adult things.",BenjaminGSimpleTruth
40,Fabulous Venue,"I knew I wanted to see this iconic landmark during my trip to California. I just happened to look up events during the time I would be visiting. This legendary venue was hosting the Paul Simon Homeward Bound finale tour while I was visiting Hollywood. I could not afford the tickets in Toronto. I found the concert by chance and was not disappointed. The amphitheater is beautiful. The sound was tremendous. The ticket price was less than $50 dollars per person. As we sat in our seats we could see the Hollywood sign and the hills in the background. It was absolutely awesome. Only issue would be the long trek down to the bottom. Other than that our visit there was amazing,",Doreen B

50,LEGENDARY,The Hollywood bowl is legendary for performance and artists. Being able to experience it in person (instead of just the movies) is a bucket list check off for sure.,Andrew B
40,Fun if you get to the bowl early,"The history of the Hollywood Bowl goes deep, and the story is fascinating. It all started at the turn of the century with actors doing Shakespeare plays way up in Beachwood Canyon. The gatherings got so big that the city decided to move it all to where the bowl now resides. Since then, a long impressive list of stars have played there, from Sinatra, to the Beatles, to Monty Python and the Rolling Stones. The museum is not that big and can be done in an hour or less.",soulart99
50,Wonderful outdoor venue for concerts!,"We visit several times per year, mostly for their non classical music offerings. Fabulous sound and a lovely atmosphere to dine and be entertained under the stars. Strongly recommend taking one of the many busses they contract to ferry people in from all over the region. Parking here is stacked and a mess.",Elaine P
50,Visited on an off day,We went when there was nobody there but a few cleaning staff. Had an amazing time climbing to the top and taking pictures. One of the best pictures you can get of the Hollywood sign is from the inside of the Hollywood bowl at the very top.,JaronTip

I cannot wait to go again.",Wizard Toby
50,One of the best venues in the world!,"Nestled in the Hollywood hills of LA, this iconic venue has seen everyone from Frank Sinatra to The Beatles, to Oscar Petersen, Diana Krall, Ella Fitzgerald, thousands of Classical concerts with fireworks, and all in a magnificent outdoor environment.

50,John Williams with the LA Philharmonic - Highlight of LA,"We watched John Williams with the LA philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. It was fantastic! It was a great evening, the pre acts were good and even featured a short animated film, that was narrated live by Kobe Bryant.The event is very family friendly, John Williams has an amazing portfolio of big ticket films that he created the score (music) for, so there is something for everyone. From Harry Potter to Indiana Jones and Jaws. The highlight has to be the Star Wars songs, where everyone in the crowd pulls out there lightsabers.Definitely our highlight of LA. Highly recommended, attend this if you can, an easy 10/10.",Henry H
50,AWESOME!,"saw chevelle, and bush here... gavin rossdale came running around giving everyine high fives and i caught a shoulder hug from him, then a guy hit pete loeffler in the head with a water bottle and got him kicked outta the park; and immediately following that a guy passed out walking downhill and munched his face up pretty good requiring an ambulance ride... it was an extremely eventful ordeal and a heck of alot of fun once we washed our hands... its a must see venue!",milvetmac
50,My BF and I went to see Lady Antebellus,"What a fantastic night! Weather was perfect. There really wasn't a bad seat in the venue (although we had good seats so maybe my critique isn't fair). Lots of big screens so if you can't see well, you can watch the screen and still get the feel of a live performance and the wonderful, open air venue. Acoustics were good and we danced and sang. Really fun. Can't wait to go back to this landmark! My grandparents used to go to concerts here and it was my first time. Very memorable.",trc08

50,Tucked in the foot of the Hollywood Hills,Stopped by the Hollywood Bowl. It is our first visit there. Nothing going on today but i highly recommend stopping when it is unoccupied to get a full view of this iconic landmark nestled at the foot of the Hollywood Hills.Seating near the stage is divided up and you bring your own seating. The seating changes to bench seating the further you go from the stage up against the hill.Definitely impressive. Im sure events are pretty incredible.,Michael H
50,Beautiful on warm summer evenings,"The Bowl is a wonderful outdoor, natural experience set in a mountainous environment. The stage is easy to see from every seat. It is fun to bring your own dinner before the performance starts. However, gourmet food is available. The very expensive boxes have tables for dining and also service from the restaurants. The acoustics are magnificent. You must pick a program in which you are interested, so if you don't like classical music, pick one of the ""pops"" programs, e.g., when they are doing John Williams.",BGivner
40,Not a bad seat in the house!,"Beautiful setting in Hollywood. Sound is amazing and great from any seat, though I prefer the Terrace level because of the table included. You can take picnic and bottles of wine. Check event some events are a third party organizer and do not allow food and drinks into their show. Parking is horrible best to park and walk up to venue from Hollywood blvd or take shuttle service. Just as bad to leave. We walked down and took an uber.",luis6686
50,"One of , if not the best outdoor venue in the world.","I go to the Bowl at least a half dozen times every summer. It's an amazing place to enjoy the LA evenings under the stars. You pack a picnic dinner and enjoy world class entertainment with 16,000 others.",GlennTheTravelGuy
40,You Gotta Experience a Concert Here!,"This is Hollywood at it's Best. The venue is made for Good Music!

50,Yes Do It. Concert California Style,"I've seen Pavarotti here, I've seen Queen here and many others. It's great. The sound is good, looking up at the Stars is good, you may well want to rent a cushion for your bottom as the seats can be hard and know where you are sitting because if you are a ways back bring some binoculars. They also have big screen tv screens up which is ok but why go live to watch TV?Have something to eat, have something to drink, bring a jacket in case it gets cold and have a ball. Look into catching the bus to the concert. They have buses running from all over the city so you don't get caught in a car park hell after the concert.",Michael S
50,Fantastic Way To Spend A Summer Evening,I love this venue. I especially like getting a box with friends and bringing a picnic with some wine. There is nothing more magical than spending a summer evening under the stars in Southern California listening to great music and sipping wine.,Marla M
40,Love that you can bring your own liquor and food,Went for a concert and I had no idea you can bring your own liquor and food if you want. Just no glass containers so remember that. The only complaint I have we got the box seats where you can sit and it's still so far from the stage paid a pretty penny for them too. Other than that such a great venue.,alfazakcn
40,"Free, doesn't take much time","This is a spot that seems to be hyped before shows but otherwise, I don't believe many people make a special trip to visit the museum. There's not much wrong with the museum, partly because it's small, but a lot of the most interesting information (especially about the architecture) is in books that lay flat and can really only be viewed by one person or one person + his friend/family member. It would be better if those interesting stories were posted for multiple people to read at the same time. In my case, though, there was only one other person in the museum, so it wasn't hard to coordinate.The employee at the front was helpful and friendly, and she correctly assumed I could go walk inside the stadium after my visit.",JJKFETP
50,Sensation Venue & Museum,"The actual museum is worth a stroll through. There have been some legendary shows at this venue, and the museum has memorabilia from most of them on display. Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Monty Python, all the way up to the present. It's not very big and can be done in an hour. The Bowl itself is consistently rated in the top five out door venues in the world. On classical nights, tues and thursday, you can get in for $15. Sometime I prefer to sit further back and take in the whole crowd. The acoustics are amazing from everywhere.",soulart99
50,Morrissey,"We went to see Morrissey at both sold out shows. The venue is gorgeous and fun! The sound was great, but I wish I had binoculars. The only downfall was the exit. Too many people crowding onto the tiny sidewalks. Lots of street vendors crowding the already too small walk way. I'm pretty sure Morrissey is against hot dogs & unlicensed tees.",MeganLAM

We sat in one of the very last rows. It is an outdoor venue with coliseum style seating. The view behind the stage is beautiful California Hills and the Hollywood sign!For all events you can bring your own food. For certain events you can even bring your own liquor.While we were there we talked to some locals that said they attend a lot of events there, they absolutely love it and there is not one bad seat in the house!",HeatherRaeOchoa

50,"Enjoy a performance under the LA sky, but BRING A BLANKET","This is one of my favorite venues for concerts. The acoustics are good and it's fun to sit under the stars at night.Helpful hint: Depending on the time of year, LA can be hot during the day, but get cold at night if you are only in shorts and a t-shirt so I'd recommend bring a blanket to cover up. This way you can enjoy the show without shivering. Even if it is too hot still at night, then just use the blanket as a seat cover to sit on.",NeoNorth

50,One Of My Favorite Music Venues,The Hollywood Bowl is one of the most iconic and enjoyable venues in all of music. The ambiance is perfect as it goes from day to night.

Only time I didn’t have a good Time was at Dave Matthews Band and that was only because we bought last minute seats and they were in the very back. Every other concert has been amazing. Love this venue !",Ksmui
10,Bowl Staff and Security is Terrible,"Attended a ""Lease Event"" at the Hollywood Bowl for Depeche Mode on 10/16/17.10 minutes in a woman vomited on my wife's shoes and pants. I alerted the Bowl staff, and it took them forever to clean the vomit and clear the woman away. During that time my wife and I were forced to sit in the aisle and get hassled by security. We told them multiple times that our seats were unusable (which is why we were sitting in the aisle) but we weren't relocated. The vomit was never fully cleaned, and the smell was so strong that we nearly vomited ourselves (even after it was ""cleaned"")Spent $300 a seat for my wife to see her favorite band for her 30th birthday and spent very little time actually using the seats! When I called the Bowl they said there was nothing they could do, and offered us seats for a concert next summer.Beware of ""Lease Events"" because apparently the Bowl staff can do anything, and they somehow aren't responsible for their actions.",theren06

30,First time at the Bowl,Was really excited to experience this venue since it is so iconic for music. We were seated in P2 and had fairly central seats to the stage. We were only a few blocks from the front of the stage however the only set of speakers were right at the front and all I could hear were the people in the row behind us talking over the music. I dread to think what the sound quality was like for those at the back.We had got the shuttle from Hollywood/Highland for $6 each thinking this would be quick however the journey took longer than walking so we walked back to our apartment on Franklin Avenue after the event. The crowds were a bit hectic but the traffic was much worse so it was quicker to walk.,Bexxcx
50,Superb!!,"Recently went to see Kings of Leon at the Hollywood Bowl - bought tickets on the day of the show. What a superb venue to see a concert, the aspect was fantastic and the sound was excellent.Luckily we were staying in Hollywood so only a 15 min easy walk there and back.",JenniG
50,Amazing customer service,"I took my husband and my mom to enjoy Cumbia at the Bowl and we had previously been there for the Tony Bennet concert (wonderful crowd) so we had imagined a similarly wonderful experience. To my surprise, the Cumbia crowd (not everyone) wasn't as courteous, respectful or friendly. We decided to buy the same seats for the concert and the people behind us were soooo drunk by the time the concert started. The 6 people behind me were drinking incessantly, their beer was splashing on me because they were trying to dance or not fall, they were slobs and just kept dropping their bottles on the ground which were all rolled under my seat at my feet, but what really pushed me over the limit was when a beer bottle slipped from their hands to my back, and that was just unacceptable. I think that people shouldn't be allowed to bring in beer bottles or cans. I went to purchase other seats and the employees were so accommodating and apologetic, I couldn't even be mad because they were so great at diffusing the situation.This is the largest venue I've visited with by far the kindest employees. Thank you. P.S. they sell a killer sangria at the Bowl.",Lory S

40,Famous for a reason,"My Boo and I were lucky enough to see Tom Petty’s final performance of his 40th anniversary tour at the Hollywood Bowl on September 25th. RIP Tom......I had never been to the Hollywood Bowl before and was excited to experience it. I must say it is a LA landmark and world famous venue for a reason. The acoustics there are phenomenal! Every seat in the house has a good view and the sound of the band was amazing. It’s a must see if your favorite artist/band is planning on being there.I would’ve given it 5 stars except for the entrance and egress from the venue. There is no parking so you need to park down near Hollywood Blvd and walk the short 10-15 minutes to get there. Be prepared for ridiculously long lines to enter and to top it off they have no rhyme or reason to the entrance. You’ll feel like cattle as you try to arrive and again when you leave.But that aside, it’s a great place to hear some excellent music.",Henry J
50,Great outdoor concert venue!,"We spent quite a few nights enjoying the musical talents of UB40, Brian Setzer and his orchestra, Ziggy Marley..,just name a few, this summer.

30,"Like watching a big screen TV at home, unless you are seated at least in the first 50 rows","while the HollywooThe Hollywood Bowel is definitely a fun place to go and see a show, but I don’t believe “the juice is worth the squeeze”The most important part in going to the Bowl is the show itself. On this issue, unless you get a very expensive seat, you end up watching the entire show on the (not so) big screens. In addition, getting to venue, parking getting and out of the place are major effort that adds at least three hours to the event itself.Now you can choose to come early, spend time at the park and enjoy a small private picnic, but either way you will spend at least 5 hours for any event and maybe much more, depending on the show.Viewing the show mostly on a screen did not provide significant experience to replace watching the event on a big screen at home.d Bowel is definitely a fun place to see a show, i dont belive the juice is worth the squeez",Elie B
40,Good venue with good vibes,"The venue is great looking and the views around are awesome. Definitely far away seats at the back if you are looking to really see the performers. Parking is the only bad part about it, which isn't unexpected in this area, just a hassle.",Michael H

Years ago we had box seats, just moved back to CA and bought tickets to see Kool & the Gang and the John Williams/LA Phil in concert. This is a fantastic outdoor venue with some great meal choices or pack your own picnic. Staff is great, venue is great, acts are top notch and all this under the stars. Bench seats are affordable, big screen to see the show when you are not close. They rent bench/seat pads for $1 per.

Never really had to wait more than 15 min.",Nick H

There are picnic tables in common areas to eat beforehand or you can enjoy a picnic and a glass of wine while you enjoy the show.WeCan't wait to go back!!",SunnygirlC
50,Unforgettable,The most incredible venue. The sight of the Hollywood sign. Feeling a part of nature but also feeling a part of a hi-tec show. Gosh - just seeing the crowds at the start and the sight of thousands of people picniccing before the show.Staff are very helpful and I felt very safe walking home at night - no stampedes or anything.NB - Pay a dollar for a cushion - you won't regret it!,Tim R
50,Highly recommend Easter Sunrise Service,"Don't waste your money getting expensive seats. The nose bleed section is a family friendly area with great acoustics. Just bring a cushion to sit on!

40,Parking is terrible!,"If you live in Southern California, this is a must-do attraction. Must of the attendees look like they go often. Here is the run-down:PARKING: Terrible! The on-site parking at called ""tiered parking"" which means you park in rows of cars. You can't leave until the first cars leave. It never fails. Some idiot will stroll to their car 30 minutes after the end of the concert so everyone behind them have to wait until they get there. We are going to try the shuttle system next time. It hope it's less frustrating.FOOD/DRINKS: The venue allows you to bring food and drinks (even alcohol!) so most people make a picnic out of the event. Plus, there are tons of restaurants, even high end ones.SEATING: Every seat is great because the sound is so wonderful. You could hear every note. We saw Jewel and Chris Botti performed the last time and it was excellent.",jt99941
50,LA PHIL in the open air,Iconic place to visit. On our last night in LA we had tickets to see the LA PHIL playing Tchaikovski. It is a beautiful venue with great view from every seat. The sound is wonderful. The combo of hotdogs and classical music was new to me. Parking is a nightmare. Parking wasn't so bad but they stack park so you have to wait for everybody to be in their car to leave.,Milo1967
50,Great place for date night.,"The Hollywood Bowl is an iconic music venue in Los Angeles. The acoustics are amazing and the capacity is enormous. From Gershwin to the Beatles to Phish, you can get it all at the Bowl. Parking is a nightmare, as is public transportation. We recommend riding your bike in if possible. Definitely don't try to drive past the bowl during a show if you're not coming to see it yourself. The traffic jams up for quite a while. Bring a date and a picnic, food is allowed inside. Great spot for a romantic evening listening to music.",Baker W

We were half way back and it was a challenge to see the entertainers on stage, but the video screens help when they are used (they were only used for Lionel Richie, not the support acts).Traffic is a major issue after the concert (it grinds to a halt).We bought our tickets off TicketMaster the day before the concert and had no issues - other websites offered resold tickets for double what we paid.",Bob59943

We would go about once a year with friends and sit way up top, so when we had the chance to buy a summer box for the season we did. Two years later we bought summer season two. The price may seem high but the experience has brought our family closer and the friends we have made (fellow season ticket holders) is priceless. Our kids start bugging us in April about when are we going to the bowl? The experience, shows, food and conversation are the very best.

50,Such a great place for a concert!,"I must admit I have always wanted to see a show in the famous Hollywood Bowl. I was not disappointed. It is a little tricky slowly driving up the winding road in a long line of traffic, so allow extra time. Even though we were one of the last cars to park, it was not a bad walk to the site. The setting is so beautiful, it was hard not to keep looking around during the show. Acoustics are great. The people working there could have been nicer though.They enforce their very strict rules in a gruff manner.",slizzie
20,Better of with another nice resturant,The wait was long. Could not understand why there was even a wait and there was an abundance of open tables. We asked for water which never came. Only after 3 times asking did water arrive. My thought is if your going to be high end make sure you have the staff to make it a very nice dinner evening. The food was good but at this point I just wanted to get out of the place. The waiter treated us like we were an afterthought. Can't say I will be back wasn't a great experience. Side note. The couple sitting next to us had to send their plate back 3 times for them to get it right . Choose another place,dwamala
50,"Opeing Night with the Moody Blues on June, 2017.","An incredible night! You MUST attend a performance here. The setting; the people; and we loved the Moody Blues - only 3 left performing. My first time so I thought the less expensive seats (stadium seating) would give a great view. They did and the big screens on each side were okay for better views BUT, I was sitting next to a large guy who was totally into the music and he rocked to whole time bumping into me constantly.So, next time I'll pay for at least seating that has arm rests. The fireworks were a nice addition.You gotta go!",404happy

50,Spectacular setting for a concert venue,"A spectacular setting for a concert venue. Have a pre-concert snack in one of the picnic areas or the cute restaurants. Hearing Beethoven Symphony no.9 was for sure a highlight. The sound is a bit sterile here, as if over processed (for TV?) and looses some of the organic feel of a live performance. However, the composition and execution are so extraordinarily good. We were supremely absorbed through it all.",Hege M
50,Skys the limit...,"What an incredible experience at the Hollywood Bowl... The entire evening was magical. We enjoyed a lovely picnic prior to the concert. There was plenty of options but I would recommend arriving several hours prior to the concert to set up. It is a first come, first serve area. Plenty of public bathrooms available. They have amazing food options as well inside. You are also able to bring your own wine into the venue. The outside atmosphere was breathtaking. A must for any traveler.

50,Sounds and vibes in the hills above Los Angeles,"Reviewing the bowl to see a concert.We hadn't been to a stadium show for a while - prefer clubs for live music, but sometimes if you want to see someone that doesn't play small clubs then you gotta go. And if you gotta go, you want to go to a place like this. And while it does hold a lot of people (about 18,500), there are bigger places out there. It's funny but all throughout the concert, it felt more intimate than big.If you go, I would recommend you do the park and ride - there are a number of them around the area. Got tickets for the park and ride thru ticketmaster (same as show) and was about $12 I think. But it was so worth it. The parking that I saw was stack parking (you know first in first out), but to even get your car moving if you were first in line with all the people walking around - we preferred to let someone else drive (about 45 minutes from Torrance parking lot). Return bus easy to to find and timing was perfect (even stopped in the bathroom before we went).Been here a couple of times now and am more and more impressed with it. Great food and drink options (and you can bring your own in - no open containers). We saw people bringing in small coolers. We just took ourselves and zipped through a line as we had nothing that needed to be looked into.Once we got in, had to check out the food options (as I did not want to leave once the concert started). Lots of options including a store that sells snacks, wine, beer etc. Yeah, yeah, yeah the food is expensive but so what, you are here to have a good time and enjoy the music. Got some food and were on our way to find our seats. Laid out nicely so you can take specific routes to your section (lower, higher etc.). Had escalator & elevator to the upper section.Seating in the first few sections are actual seats with the further back sections having ""seats"" - numbers on benches. There are also some box seat sections so if you have more people, you can get these. Giant screens on each side of the stage so even if you are further back you can see.Theater is open air so summer time is a great time - lots of stars and fresh air while you rock out to your favorite musicians. Acoustics were good and indeed as they sang ""We will rock you!"" - was so true. Left that night feeling thoroughly rocked. Have fun.",jenLeCreate
50,Bets Venue I have ever been to!,"We saw Jack Johnson here, and it was the perfect venue for this type of show. Felt like a classy backyard party. We stayed in Hollywood and took Uber there.

We brought snacks and wine and beer, and had a great time. Can't wait to return!",Cassie P
50,Perfect Acoustics,"Came here to see Jack Johnson and had an amazing time. This place is way better than a traditional arena, its very intimate for its size and the sound created from the location is fantastic.

I've heard all kinds of music and I've been when I'm like I don't know if that's the kind of music I'll like, but without fail I always have an amazing time. There is something about being at the bowl and with good friends you really can't go wrong.*Also unless you just have to be close to the front because the person performing is your all time favorite go for the middle to back section. The jumbo screens don't allow you to miss anything and the sound....well that's why people go it travels through the Hollywood Hills perfectly!A couple of tips:Park near Hollywood area and walk the mile up if you can. It will truly save you time and a massive headache trying to get in and out. Plus you are bound to meet some pretty cool people on the walk!Bring some yummy food that you can eat easily. I know you can bring wine in, but you'll have to check on the website for limitations etc. I don't drink but my friends have enjoyed a glass or two!The facilities are clean, but I advise for women especially to be smart about the restroom breaks...though there are several stalls if it's busy you will be waiting.

Even so a lovely contractor let us through all the construction barriers to have a look around the bowl itself. I'm a big Beatles fan so just being in the venue looking at the distinctive stage was a big thrill. I was amazed at the size of the seating area, I thought it would be much smaller, but, even so, all areas had a great view of the stage. I would have loved to attend an actual gig there but there was nothing on at the time of our 4 day stay in LA.A trip to the loo made me smile as the urinals have that same hollywood bowl stage appearance!Personally I found it a great way to spend a couple of hours.",newspapertaxi

Luckily for me I had a great group with me. Some of the performances were amazing! Others were like lord don't put me to sleep. The tempo was kind of off.

If it is a 'Bowl' sponsored event you are able to bring your own libations into the venue along with your food. I would highly recommend using Uber, Lyft, or taxi to get to and from the bowl.

50,THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL,"The Hollywood Bowl is a beautiful place to listen to music ..I have been a member for years, and have enjoyed many artists who have been inducted into the music Hall of Fame . There are box seats that are close to the stage , which are nice to enjoy dinner, great places to buy dinner or cheese and wines, and also nice to bring picnic dinners to enjoy on the lawn before the show. The rows that are not box seats are also great to enjoy your meal, just need to be able to balance the food boxes well on your lap. The Hollywood Bowl has tickets for sale that you can buy without being a member, and it makes for a wonderful gift for someone to enjoy music under the stars. Everyone should enjoy the Hollywood Bowl as often as possible, and at least once in your life if you are from out of town. It is an amazing experience for everyone. Traffic to the Bowl can be a nightmare, so you need to allow enough time to get there, or take the shuttles, look up Hollywood Bowl Shuttles for your nearest location- this is the easiest way.. The parking is stacked parking , which is a little hard if you have an emergency, you won't be able to leave.. but we always park in the neighborhood parking lots and walk a little[ there are many parking lots that are a few blocks away if you don't mind walking, but can be a little pricey, around 25.00- 30.00 , but worth it so that you don't get stuck in stacked parking} It can be a little tricky getting to the Bowl, but definitely worth the trouble!",Janet D

Some of the seats closer in the middle have real chairs and tables for picnics.We parked at Hollywood and Highland and walked over, $15 for parking all day. Walk is less than a mile, uphill a good bit, but as long as you're in decent shape it's not hard. If you park at the bowl be prepared to wait a long time, they stack cars, meaning they are not in spaces but parked right next to each other. So you have to wait for all the cars in front of you to leave before you can leave. Didn't look fun when we walked out to see people just stuck in their cars for however long.",RobD

I was about halfway back, on the left side of the venue and the acoustics were great.

The views of the hills and the Hollywood sign are superb, and it was great to be able to wander around the entire area – from the nosebleed seating up the back to the stalls and right up to the stage.

40,A cool thing to do while visiting LA,"For some reason attending a concert at the Hollywood Bowl is generally not included on many things to do lists for LA. I don't understand why. The first couple times we visited LA we didn't even think about going there. One day quite by chance we drove past it and decided we wanted to go to a concert only to find out it was closed for the season. Well we've since become a lot smarter. The season runs for about 6 months from May through October. You can assemble a complete schedule of concerts by combining those listed at the Hollywood Bowl website with those listed on Ticketmaster. The 2017 events are now posted and it's not too early to get tickets as some events sell out quickly. If you're panning a trip to LA in 2017 and you haven't experienced a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, I recommend you include one in your trip planning. We found it to be a very enjoyable and memorable experience.",DMJA21

40,We got to see Andrea Bocelli,"In between business meetings we were able to go see a concert. We have never been here and I wore 4"" heels. Needless to say I was sorry immediately. It's quite a hike at least a mile, up hill, (both ways). Just kidding, but wear flats ladies.",alohacori96707
30,History and traffic mayhem.,"Five stars for the venue, and its history. Minus one for the traffic it causes for miles in every direction, and minus another for how much you'll pay to park anywhere nearby. Los Angeles unfortunately did not have the foresight to put this mega attraction on the subway line. This said if you play it right there are some event buses that travel from certain park and rides as well as nearby malls where you can park for free and take a slow bus ride into the eye of the storm.",BVinLA
50,Visiting the Bowl,"I have been reading the reviews here and there are a few things I must add as a regular visitor to the bowl:- There should be a section to review a Bowl CONCERT experience. This is under the Museum heading, which to me is separate. Searched and couldn't find a separate heading.- Many complain about the parking. It seems a little known fact that you can park off site and shuttle in for FREE. There are remote parking sites at the Ventura Loat on Ventura Blvd. and Lankershim in the valley, at Hollywood and Highland, at the L.A. Zoo, and at Union Station. The shuttle is $6, but if you have a Metro Tap Card it's FREE!- The dining/concert experience is unparalleled. If you get there early enough, Hike up to the picnic area right across from the snack stand for sections Q-U. The views are beautiful, the atmosphere jovial, and on a warm summer day with a glass of wine I'll have a nap before the concert. Unless of course, you have a box, then dine there.- The Museum is small, provides some history, but this should not be the primary reason for your visit. Use it as an introduction to the Bowl, then walk around, visiting all the levels and the informational signage there. Best for first time visitors.- Leaving the Bowl is a like a cattle call, but what would you expect with 18,000 people leaving at the same time? If you shuttled, walk down the hill, and to the right of the tunnel (don't go in.) are all the shuttle lines, make sure you are on the one for the lot you parked at. The lines can be long, but they move quickly, and we are usually out of there within a half hour.",Mark8691

Needed to get a bracelet to prove old enough to drink, even though I am going to be 60 soon.Difficulty getting out of the venue. Went to the entrance and they were not allowing taxis through until all buses etc had gone.

50,Out of Town Experience,We saw the Nightmare Before Christmas and loved the setting and the performance. Since we visited from out of town and stayed at at hotel here are some tips we found handy from experience.Arriving: we stayed in Beverly Hills and used a car sharing service. Our fee was only $13 and well worth getting dropped off near the entrance.Leased Event: since this is a leased event we were not allowed to bring alcohol so make sure you check this out before if you plan on bringing a bottle of wine.Food/Beverage; Kitchen 22 was recommended for dining and we found the food to be just OK. The line was really long (almost 30 minutes). We would pre arrange food delivery (make sure you read the deadline for ordering) to our seats or have our hotel make a food basket to safe time. Beverage lines were not long at all.Seats: we had terrace box seats and the views were great as was the ability to meet the people around you (very convivial)!.Departure: our car sharing service meets you at the bus stop (not the same location as the drop off) and we were out of the park in no time.Definitely worth the experience and so much better organized and set up than many other outdoor concern venues in the US. Our local version called Ravinia could really learn from them on how to get people in and out of the park.,BellBoys60625
40,Little gem,Allow extra time to check this out on your way to the Hollywood Bowl. A lot of vintage Hollywood and movie history to see.,SMOgal
50,World Class Venue and the sound is fantastic,"For an outdoor venue, the sound was excellent. I've been twice now; once to see Glen Campbell in his farewell tour (with Dawes and Jackson Browne) and our cancer this month with Van Morrison being joined by Tom Jones. Both experiences were excellent in terms of the shows and the music. The only complaints I have are those who consume too much, and talk through the show, and the lines for the bathrooms and food/drinks. As we walked out, one 60-ish woman complained to a friend that Van didn't play ""Brown Eyed Girl"". I replied to her that he did and her reply back was for me to ""mind my own business"". She was toasted. Is it possible today to enjoy a concert without getting wasted?",Joe T
30,Didn't live up to desire,I was looking for history presented about the wonderful Bowl. It was very small and not well presented. It could be so much more for those of us who love the real Hollywood History. Having said this the exhibt did give you some background about the Bowl. Many who go to the Bowl do not know about the museum and it needs to be marked better for people to find it.,paortho
50,AN EXPERIENCE,This LA landmark is one of the best entertainment venues on the planet. The setting was beautifully designed for the best acoustics and most amazing atmosphere.

40,Definitely go and enjoy a concert here,"We went to see John Williams conduct the LA Philharmonic here. It was our first visit to the Hollywood Bowl, and we had a great time! We were worried about sitting in the bench seats for two hours, but we were both very comfortable even without seat cushions. The people around us were generally considerate of everyone's personal space. There were tons of food options, many of which looked good, though I didn't try any this trip.This place is much larger in person than I though it would be – not a bad thing, but if you want a decent view without looking at a large screen, buy seats as far up as you are comfortable buying. Finally, given the large size of the venue (and relatively small number of exits), give yourself plenty of time to exit after the show. I would also suggest staying within walking distance or parking further away and then walking (as opposed to parking on-site), as traffic around the Bowl is challenging before and after the show.",zinear

50,Must experience a concert here!,"I've seen a LOT of concerts in my day, seeing one here is an absolute must for any music fan. That said, as a tourist it is awesome but I think if I lived here I'd probably rather have my favorite band just play Staples or whatever since it is a LOT of work simply getting to the Bowl, let alone actually getting in and then being seated. You definitely do not just pull into a lot, park, and then show them your ticket and walk in. Leave a lot of time even if you're simply walking or taking transit, it's hurry up and wait for sure. Back to the music though, this place is magical and it's cool you can bring in your own food and beverages (though check their website first to make sure what you are allowed in). Binoculars are a good idea but the giant HD screens are excellent. So too was the sound. Was there for 2 ELO fireworks shows, was interesting to see how the music synced with the display since that varies by seating location. One tip to get in faster, everyone goes to the left and lines up in front, stay right and walk between the parked cars toward the lighted pole, you can basically walk right in at this entrance.",Ydnar

50,Music in the Summer,"If you love music and the outdoors and there is someone you have wanted to hear perform during your summer visit to LA and they are at the Hollywood Bowl, you must make an effort to get tickets.

Of all the venues that I have been to, I would rank it second only to Central Park in NY. The setting is great, the ambience and history are worth the visit. I was a bit disappointed in the museum as I was expecting pictures and memorabilia from Beatles and Elton John shows. Overall, it was a very good experience.",Sal C
50,Just the place to relax,Anytime whether in the afternoon or early evenings this place is just fun! I suggest the back bleachers if you want the hippie experience if you get my drift! But that's a the very top. The near mid section is relaxed also. But I find the simi cheap seats in the near back are great for those jazz concerts. One can bring food and libation usually be left alone. This isn't a Dodger game after all. So people are pretty chill.,Dar

30,Bring your Binoculars,"I have seen many bands at the Bowl over the years and every time I say, ""never again."" I love the outdoor setting, taking a picnic to eat before or during the performance, and the fireworks (at certain shows). What lets the Bowl down is what lets all big stadiums down--you end up watching the TV screen as most of the seats are just too far from the stage. Unless you pay top prices to sit down near the front you need binoculars to see anything. The sound is fantastic though.One other gripe--as the seating is rows of benches you usually find yourself squashed as the space allocated to each person is quite small.",Stephanie C
50,Great Place For Concerts!,"Hollywood Bowl can be experienced in a couple of different ways. If you are lucky enough to know someone to get into a box, pack a picnic with food and wine and enjoy the concert in your own private box. Otherwise just be in the crowd and enjoy the open seating style (bring your own cushion as the seats are hard) and listen to music with the surrounding hollywood hills in the background. The higher up your seat is, the stronger the smell of weed so please be aware lots of people smoke all around you!",George818
50,ELO - a night to remember,"Terrific concert, amazing music, dancing in the aisles, and end-of-show fireworks makes for one great evening. Do NOT park at the Bowl, as there are numerous parking options elsewhere. Also, the website does NOT profile that there are several food trucks for MANY food options inside the Bowl. We ate at Bossa Nova outside the Bowl (see review), and it was good, but next time, we will just eat at one of the many food venues inside the Bowl.",LV_Lee
40,Greatly Improved,I hadn't been to the Bowl in years but a friend of a friend was appearing there so I went. The place has been vastly improved. I sat in section E near but not in the back box seat sections. The acoustics are great improved and there are large screens which makes viewing from the moderately priced side seats still quite good. (I didn't walk to the very back of the Bowl to see what that was like.) The only criticism that I had was that the bench seating is quite hard and I would advise one to bring a cushion or two.,resipsaloquitur
50,Live music at its best!,"The Hollywood Bowl is a classic venue for music connoiseurs and a must for everyone who's going to L.A.. We attended a concert directed by John Williams himself accompanied by David Newman, the theater is magnificent and the sound is superb, the open air experience is unforgettable and makes the music all the more enjoyable.

The receptionist was lovely and very informative.",Blueyedsusan
50,Hollywood Bowl - JUST DON'T MISS IT!,"The Bowl continues to be a world-class performance venue and still a very LA experience!. Recently went to a Wednesday night Jazz performance and, even though I have been in the past and expected great things, was still impressed yet again. If you visit or live in LA, the Bowl is not to be missed. There are no bad seats and many options, so anyone can afford it. Plenty of food choices, so go early, have dinner, and enjoy the ambiance. Or, better yet, if you have time, bring your own picnic dinner and don't forget some dessert for intermission. Do bring a jacket since even on warm days, the evening can be cool. The only problem is parking - very limited at the Bowl itself (it is ""stacked"", so you can wait forever to get out) - or try one of the shuttle buses from a satellite parking lot, better. Best choice yet, just stay in one of the hotels within walking distance and avoid the car mess. There are a number of choices in different price ranges and this makes the evening so much more enjoyable. Check the reviews of area hotels for a good place - we did this time and had a lovely night of it! Don't miss. Don't miss. Don't miss!",betterontheroad
50,Terrace bos seats a treat!,"This is our second Hollywood Bowl summer season after many years of attending one or two concerts a year. and this year we upgraded to the terrace box seats. These are wooden partitioned seats - 4 canvas chairs (which collapse for storage) and two 20' x 20' dinner tables. There are also 5 and 6 seat boxes and several suggested layouts for seats and tables. There is even a wine bottle holder.It goes without saying that there is music for every kind of music lover., and seat prices to fine every budget from less than $20 up to over $300 depending on the concert. Picnic dinners are allowed in the theatre, and it is great fun watching the variety of food preparation people go to. If the concert is a ""Lease Event, meaning not an LA Phil production, there are beverage restrictions.For me the fun is dinner before the concert begins. If we are sitting on bench seats, juggling food is challenging and so we eat at one of the lovely picnic spots scattered over many levels, usually buying a salad and sandwich at the Marketplace and sharing them. If we are in the Terrace box seats, then we bring plates, tablecloths, wine glasses and silverwear, or purchase food at the Marketplace or bring food with us. My photos show both.Parking onsite $20, or catch a shuttle bus from many So Cal areas for $6-8, or walk a mile from Hollywood/Highland Metro station.This iconic venue should be on everyone's LA visit bucket-list!",astrojane
50,Chicago concert 4th of July,I loved the fact that we could see the Hollywood sign from our seats. The concert was fantastic. The fireworks were superb! We brought our own wine and food into the venue. We rented seat pads for a very low price. Everyone was very nice.,Buckeye_Mom_2013

I love being able to bring in picnic/wine and just relax.The food and wine they offer there now is really impressive as well - sometimes you just have to have fried chicken, and theirs is quite good!One of my favorite things about living in LA. End of story!",VickiLosAngeles

It was so relaxing to eat dinner in a beautiful setting after the horrific traffic. I noticed some people had fresh flowers and candles on their table tops. Definitely nice to picnic with friends before the concert. I can't wait to return although I would buy 4 tickets in a box and not share the small box area. Nice LA experience!",pvcathy

40,Great Music Under The Stars,"Each year, the Hollywood Bowl has little improvements. The bathrooms have been upgraded along with the picnic areas. New bench seats and higher quality food venues. Be aware that this is a very difficult venue if you are handicapped. Try to purchase handicapped parking when you purchase your tickets. 2 of the escalators were not operating both times I went in the summer of 2016. This is a more affordable venue for classical music than Disney Hall. It's fun to bring a picnic and listen to stellar music.

50,Great Experience when Visiting Los Angeles,"Family vacation in Los Angeles area, and decided to do something unique. Visiting the Hollywood Bowl instantly became a destination. Planning to visit is a little tricky, as you can’t drive there (very little parking), so need to also buy tickets for one of many shuttle spots. We visited on a Saturday evening when Los Angeles Symphony was playing, with times where Los Angeles Ballet joined the performance. The bus picked us up in Santa Monica, and parking was very easy at the stop. In addition, Hollywood Bowl had a representative at the stop to ensure got on right bus, and answer any questions. Very easy from this point. Hollywood Bowl allows people to bring own food and wine, and we stopped at Bay Cities Deli (see that review). When we arrived, realized everyone brings own food and wine, people make this a picnic event. We arrived at ~7pm, and realized would have been good to get there sooner. All picnic tables and grassy spots were taken. We ended up placing blankets on a side walk, and this actually worked well. It was quaint and fun. Our seats in the amphitheater were off to left of stage, and were the bench seats. The seats are comfortable and reasonable space. While we were a little far from stage, the large screen allowed to see orchestra play, was very enjoyable. The sun went down, the orchestra started to play, and simply enjoyable. The bonus was fireworks at the end, choreographed to the music. We are a family of six, with both little kids and teenage boys and girls. The entire family really enjoyed the experience. In fact, a highlight of the trip. In speaking to local residents, they view the Hollywood Bowl as a “gem”, and after experiencing would agree.",MacungieJohn

50,So easy to get to with a shuttle,"We saw Gladys Knight here recently. I don't understand the comments about it being tricky to get to. We caught the metro to Hollywood Highland station, then got the shuttle bus which leaves from Orange Plaza ....easy as. It drops you rights at the entrance. Free if you have a TAP card (public transport card)It's also not difficult to walk to from the metro.There is a large crowd leaving all at once at the end, and the walk is a bit further back to the shuttle. The buses leave for various points all over LA (check on the Bowl's website for details...there's park and ride stations in various places).The venue itself is iconic (at the risk of deploying that overused word!) and relaxed. There's the to-be-expected security check, but you can take in picnics including alcohol, and coolers.We had a great summer's night of entertainment, and I can't think that there would be a bad seat in the house.",Arncliffegirl
40,The Guy with the man named Beck,"The Hollywood bowl located in Hollywood California is a super cool venue to see a concert. I came to see Jeff Beck and Buddy Guy perform for his 50th anniversary. I was not disappointed, special guests included Jan Hammer, Steven Tyler, Billy Gibbons, etc. If you have never been to concert there I suggest you make it a priority to go. The amphitheater, shaped like a bowl has a backdrop of the Hollywood hills and the Hollywood sign. The music sounded amazing and the people there were all very friendly. They have different seating areas and you can spend anywhere from 500$ to 14$ and I think they even have 1$ seating. I came on a whim and bought a 14$ ""nosebleed"" ticket that day. The view from there was perfect. I liked sitting farther away to see the whole venue, mountains and atmosphere. You can rent out a seat cushion for one dollar (the top tiered sections are long benches, I didn't pay a dollar and I was comfortable the whole time, save your dollar and sit on your jacket) They have two tv monitors on the sides and you can easily see the stage and who is performing. Bring your own food and alcohol and have a good time. 😎🍁🍾🍹🌴.Bring a sweater or jacket , it does get cooler at night. Leaving the venue wasn't difficult, the flow moved seamlessly and fast.",Rgd973
10,The Backyard (The new restaurant),"This is the new high end restaurant for the Bowl. We went last night and never again!I don't object to paying $58 for a steak, with $15 for the salad and $20 for the starch of choice but when I do I do not expect it to arrive at the table before I have even started the salad. The steak was cold, the butter topping actually congealed on top and I had to scrape it off. My husbands fish was also cold, totally disappointing.We have had a box for the bowl concerts for 30 years and it is a wonderful evening venue and deserves a much better restaurant.",sblasingame138

50,Amazing Place!,"I LOVE attending concerts at the Hollywood Bowl. Especially, if we're able to get a box seat near the stage. However, it really doesn't matter where you sit....it's a great place to be.When its LA Philharmonic playing, you can bring your own wine and food, but there are restrictions when it's a ""lease event"", like Sting, Paul McCartney, Stones, etc. At lease events you have to buy from the concessions in the Bowl only. Be sure to check in advance. otherwise, you end up throwing away great bottles of wine or walking back to your vehicle.Awesome place....Enjoy!cheers!",Richard Newcomb
50,A hidden gem,"Most people who visit the Hollywood Bowl don't even know there is a museum there. Even concert goers don't often know. The museum is on your left as you enter the Bowl grounds, on Peppertree Lane. Admission is always free. The hours vary during the Hollywood Bowl season and off season. The ground floor is a permanent exhibit about the history of the Bowl. The second floor has a gallery that changes its exhibit yearly. This year the exhibit is a showcase of posters that are sent to pilots all over the area letting them know that the Bowl is a No Fly Zone during concerts. Illustrators over the years have taken a creative interpretation of how to present this information. Stop by and enjoy.",Robin W

40,"Bring your Own Picnic, pass on the box meals","The Hollywood Bowl is an interesting setting for music and dance. A little awkward to get to, although the parking options are wide once you are there. Everything from onsite parking to little parking areas are within easy walking distance. We choose to park in the Hollywood Highland mall and walk over to avoid the crush of patrons spilling out of the nearby stacked parking lots.As we have had great luck with the box lunches at the Greek theater, we decided to try them at the Hollywood bowl's Kitchen 22 as well. Bad decision. Once you find the spot where they dispense these literal boxes of food, you are forced to wait by the side door of the kitchen where servers brusquely push past you with no attempt to feign courtesy. I guess they see you as bypassing their services and show you obvious disdain while you are waiting to pay and receive your food.Once you receive your food you can take it to one of the many picnic areas and consume it. Notice I didn't say, enjoy it. I ordered the THE WESTSIDE STORY which included: grilled chicken breast with almond soffrito fregola with chickpeas, carrots and spinach marinated beets with horseradish and parsley baguette with tapenade chocolate chip cookie. It was all bland and boring, except the tapenade which was overly salty spread on a dry baguette. My wife ordered THE BURTON WAY which included: slow-roasted salmon with cucumber yogurt quinoa with turmeric, kale and snap peas tomato and watermelon salad root veggie chips, chocolate caramel brownie.While the salmon was pleasant enough, the rest of it was (like mine) like a slight class upgrade on a airline meal. At $34 a pop both meals where ordinary at best. As others have said, prepare a picnic meal and bring your own wine or beer. Don't feel like bringing the meal, try one of their casual (fast food) options which are much cheaper and are much tastier as well. Or try one of the many restaurants nearby...",RealRoadWarrior
50,Take a picnic and enjoy the music,"By reading the Bowl's website you will find out everything you need to make your trip there successful including various ways to get there. I highly recommend taking a picnic. Wine and glasses are allowed, picnic areas are provided overlooking L.A. And everyone there is in a festive mood. Get there an hour or two before the performance to enjoy your food . The sound in the Bowl was superb and we had a fantastic evening.",DME9
50,Great performances under the stars!,"We thorough enjoyed a Latin-themed performance the other night.Here are some recommendations for getting the most out of your visit:1- Take a bus to this venue otherwise you will find yourself in a parking nightmare extraordinaire. Luckily, our friends knew about this so we drove to a certain location and got on the bus.2- Get the box seats with tables that can later be removed. The seats further back seem so far away.3- There are only 2 large bathrooms for the crowd of 17,000 so plan carefully before and during intermission. If you go at the end, you'll miss your bus back!4- Bring a picnic dinner and eat it at one of the picnic tables outside of the Bowl.",houdi
50,A Great Way to Spend a Summer Evening,"We've been subscribers to the Hollywood Bowl for a number of years, sharing a box with another couple. It continues to be a highlight for us each summer. Boxes, if you can afford them, are terrific. There frequently are tickets turned in by subscribers, last minute is possible on Tuesday and Thursday.The Lucques Group is the new food operation for the Bowl. It is a massive improvement over the previous group. Better service, many more selections than before. While it is pricey, the quality is consistently excellent. The BBQ dinner for two was perfect for the evening, plenty of food and leftovers to take home.If you are sitting in benches, I highly recommend you buy an extra seat for your group. It is a big help especially if you are picnicking to be able to spread out.If you are visiting L.A. during the summer season, spend a night here, you won't be sorry.Last note, park and ride or shuttles allow you to avoid the stack parking which is guaranteed to lengthen depature time (It was 45 minutes last night parking in Lot A).",JRwestla
40,Great venue for a concert but getting there can be a challenge,"Saw Sting and Peter Gabriel on July 18th. Was a great concert , beautiful venue and the sound was awesome. We stayed nearby but we are not in shape enough to walk the hills to get there so we drove. It was 25 bucks to park and they do that ""Stack"" parking so you can't leave early. Also for this concert you couldn't bring in alcohol but bottled water/soda and snacks were ok. Our seats (and most) were wooden benches so for a buck you can rent a cushion. We had a great time and met some really nice people but i would recommend getting there very early and picnicking if you drive or use public transit/uber etc. Large beer was 16 bucks so pricey.",Chris C
50,Glorious music-filled evenings under the stars,"I have visited the Hollywood Bowl every summer since I was a child, as have many other Angelenos.Blockbuster shows on the weekends, some with fireworks. Classical on Tuesday and Thursday. Jazz on Wednesday. World music on Sunday.There are plenty of picnic opportunities, so come early. One can bring one's own wine inside the bowl for HB (not lease) events.There are public transportation options from all over the city and a shuttle from the Hollywood Highland MTA Red line stop.",Chris
30,Had to go once,"On holiday and had to see the famous holiwood bowl.Heard the LA Philharmonic, concert performance of West Side Story. We were in the last row of the boxes which was a long way from the stage. However, there are large screens which one can see with ease or bring binoculars. Large crowds so transport is slow arriving and departing. An experience",Paul F
50,One of a kind venue,"Even forgetting the history, this is a excellent facility. It has excellent site lines, even in section S everything was visible, very small of course, but no obstructions from the rows in front. They also have sufficient help to guide you through the complex and to your seats. Sufficient rest rooms are always nice as well.We took the shuttle bus from the zoo and I can't emphasize how convenient and stress free it made the event.",Spw91
30,This is an open air theature and not a museum,"We visited it as part of the Grand LA tour, It was very big and they usually host some show / event in it",humaid_uae
40,Fun Visit for a Slice of Music History,We enjoyed visiting the Bowl just to see it as it is the home of many famous concerts. Great vistas as well. We didn't go into the museum as we didn't have time. If you are there when the LA Orchestra or other event then it would be a great venue to hear live music,J0hnPM10
50,Best Concert Venue,"First class through the compound, excellent fine dining. Be sure to plan ahead, and enjoy pre event festivities, can take own wine and beer before concert. The only bad thing are the lines once inside the facility they take for ever to purchase food, or drinks buy them before show starts or be prepared to loose at least two or three of your favorite songs in line.",Oscar M
50,Excellent Venue,"Been here a few times now and have always been happy with the visit. Good sound and the big screens help with viewing the performers. There is traffic coming and going as would be expected, so planning for it is helpful. Lots of places for picnicking. Would highly recommend if you can fit it in. The food on the inside is expensive, good, but expensive.",S B
50,Star Trek at the BOWL - Amazing!!!,"4 tickets in our box given to us by friends who own the box. Brought Sushi , appetizers and desert. It was amazing the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra was directed while we watched the 1st of the JJ Abrams re-boot of Star Trek. With the CSUF Choir singing along it was one of the most amazing nights at the bowl, we have ever experienced.If you ever have a chance to go this amazing ampetheater by all means go! You will never forget the experience.",Sean r
50,All seats are great,bring your own picnic. Drinks and food inside are very expensive. The $1 seat cushion is a great deal. Cools down when sun goes down,Luc V
50,Chicago!,"We attended the Chicago concert to celebrate July 4th. The orchestra performed first and was spectacular. Chicago, backed by the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, put on an incredible show. The concert ended with a phenomenal fireworks display with the orchestra playing Sousa marches. The venue allows food and drink to be brought on to the premises. There was ample food and drink available for purchase. The facilities were clean and more than accommodating for the over 10k audience members.",MommaGiiGii
50,Great place to see a show!,"This is a wonderful outdoor venue! Parking isn't so great, so leave plenty of time before and after. Wonderful place for a picnic and a concert.",R3022NRlisag
50,The best summer activity ever!,"Being known as the ""bowl guy"" it has been my pleasure over the last several years to attend many wonderful events, concerts and good times with friends at the iconic Hollywood Bowl. I was very timid about going at first....the parking, the tickets, the food and all those people....However.......If you learn about taking the shuttle buses for a minimal fee, like from the LA Zoo a round trip ride is $6 per person; the tickets are very easy, either on goldstar.com or go to the bowl box office to avoid extra fees; bring your own food, anything from Subway sandwiches to baked salmon to KFC with lots of cheap wine has been the basis of a great evening of music....and the people.....be friendly, everyone is there for a nice evening, share some cookies, lend your wine bottle opener, a plate or a spoon. Experience life at the Hollywood Bowl! Like most wonderful events, it goes by so very quickly! Grab it and enjoy!",Michael G
50,Summer LA Concert Series,"We just went to the Hollywood Bowl to see Dudamel conduct the orchestra in West Side Story. It is the first time I have seen a full Broadway show presented in this manner. The staging of the actors, their singing and presentation on the large projection screens was fabulous to behold. I wish thy produce many such shows in the future.",martin k
50,The Bowl Rocks,"This is the best outdoor venue in So California. I attended the Weird Al Jankovic performance last night amid the Sand Fire burning in Santa Clarita & higher than average temperature. Neither were an issue at the Bowl. The weather was perfect. Suzanne Goin & Caroline Styne have done a fabulous remaking of the dining program called food + wine. Every imaginable dining venue from 3 course meals served at your seats to casual street faire is available. Check for events that allow patrons to bring their own food & drink. I recommend arriving early, enjoying some food & drinks then, sitting back & taking in the show. Seating ranges from benches (cushions rent for just $1), boxes (a little tight) to super seats (oversized comfort). No need to bring binoculars as there are big screens for close up views. A hint about parking...find the shuttles in the zoo parking lot & the drivers will drop you off right at the front gate. No stacked parking hassle/wait.",JeanineFallbrook
50,"Friends, family, couples, and solo - it's always a wonderful time at the Bowl","I have been coming to the Hollywood Bowl since I was a child and it's always been a lovely experience. These days we snag box seats but I've also spent time in the nosebleed section. Each seating scenario is unique but I have no complaints about any of them - the acoustics are fantastic both near and far, making every seat a great one - especially since the remodeling a few years back.This is a great place to bring wine and your favorite picnic foods, arrive early and just enjoy the view. Arrive early for the best parking because it's a total zoo afterwards. No DSLR cameras. Alcohol and glass is fine. And...celebrity sightings abound!",JuliaGooliaAbroad
50,My Favorite Concert Venue in LA,"No other venue beats the Hollywood Bowl. The acoustic is perfect, the place is beyond beautiful. If you manage to get a booth, you will be thrilled.",sheilafajl
50,it's the Bowl not the players.,The Bowl is a great place for a large group or a quite date for two. You can bring your own food and drink and relax without being bothered. We've com many times and love it.Some events have fireworks and they are great too! If You purchase food at the bowl it's little on the pricey side but it's all top quality. Parking on site or off can be little pricy too. Save the headache and take the bus. You can search online and find the one right for you. We get picked up in Rowland Heights and dropped on the front steps for $8. You won't be disappointed.,BobBarb
50,What a great venue!,I love the Hollywood Bowl. We had box seats and ordered sushi for two plus some drinks. What a huge difference over other venues with hot dogs and hamburgers. Loved it!,WDavidPence
50,What a venue!,"If you are in LA on a visit try and book something here. We choose a classic concert ($8 a ticket) and were not disappointed. The Venue is steep though so if you have problems walking or using stairs please be aware (they do have escalators and staff to help if required)What a fantastic way to listen to music, under the stars with fresh air. Couldn't stop looking at the hills in the background and just thinking wow I am so lucky to sit here and relax like this.You can take in food and drink.See if there is a park and ride near to where you are staying as this will be easier then parking there.We found one which was $3 dollars each way.",E H
40,Dudamel!!,My family and I enjoyed watching the performance of Rhapsody in Blue with Dudamel and Yuja Wang. Acoustics were great and the crowd wasn't too rowdy. Do not bring a DSLR-type camera. They do not allow those in the venue. We had to check our camera in and get it after.,TravelBugKrueger
50,Great location,"Not many places beat this for a concert venue a warm summer Californian evening listening to Sting and Peter Gabriel was amazing. Location is perfect , sound good ,food good ........but parking looked a challenge. Long live Uber to get in here easily and just have a drink wait for mayhem to clear then uber home!!",MBL001
40,Quite an experience!,"We went to the Hollywood Bowl for the Sting Peter/Gabriel Concert. The concert was wonderful...they put on quite a show. As for the Hollywood Bowl...it was an experience I think everyone should have at least once in their lifetime, but to enjoy it you must know the following. Do NOT drive...the parking lots are ""stacked"" and so only one car can get in or out at a time, and you are trying to pull out onto busy Highland Ave. The traffic starts hours before the concert and is backed up forever! Take advantage of the many bus/shuttle options instead. Don't bother with a cab, they have the same issues getting close to the venue as cars. I highly recommend doing what we did...stay just up the street at the Hilton Garden Inn and walk. It is an easy walk to the venue, it only took us 5 minutes and is easy. Walk out of the hotel, take a left and walk straight! But be sure to wear comfortable shoes because once there you will have a bit of a trek...ALL uphill, especially if you are seated at the top section of the venue. They do have escalators to help a bit of the way and I did see a small elevator (I presume for handicap use). We went 45 minutes before the venue opened (it opens an hour and a half before the concert) and it was already crowded. You can buy food and drinks (see the website for descriptions) or bring your own. Normally you can bring bottles of wine/beer but this was a ""leased"" concert and different rules apply. Be sure to review them prior to arriving...no alcohol/umbrellas/cameras etc will be allowed inside. They check everything you are carrying as you enter. You can buy wine/beer at the venue and carry it inside...but not all vendors are alike. We ordered a large glass of wine ($24) after spending 25 minutes in line. We got a flimsy plastic cup with no cover on it. It was a nightmare carrying a full open cup of red wine on the long trek through the tight crowds, especially while they checked my bags. They require YOU to open your bags to show them everything in them and there is no place to set your wine down. Others were carrying sturdy, closed plastic glasses of wine with a straw. When we asked our vendor for tops they said they don't offer tops or straws, ""that is a different vendor"". Wish we had known so we could have gotten in that line instead! Choose your seat carefully. It was hot and we ended up sitting in blinding direct sun until sunset while the other 3/4 of the venue was in shade. We were in section M-3. That section has bench seats and you are packed in like sardines when they are sold out (as this concert was.) We almost brought a cooler with our picnic dinner in it but changed to a backpack at the last minute. We were glad we did because no way anything is going to fit under the seats...you have about half a foot under your seat as there is a concrete lip that extends halfway under your seat. You will end up holding anything you brought in your lap the whole concert. We could see the huge screens just fine from our seats but you really need binoculars to see the people on stage. I'm glad I brought mine because they didn't project video of the action on stage for most of the concert...they projected on the screens images chosen by Sting (photos of people around the world, etc) and special effects. Makes for an exciting show but I wanted to see Sting singing, not pictures. Once the sun goes down behind the hills the venue is really beautiful...glowing Hollywood Hills with a small piece of the Hollywood sign showing, and the constantly changing lights of the stage. When it turns dark two spotlights shine overhead making an ""X"" over the stage...soooo Hollywood!! The acoustics were perfect. Truly a ""must see"" at least once in your life. When the concert is over I suggest waiting 10 minutes in your seat to avoid the massive crush to get out. It was very pleasant sitting up there enjoying the view instead of joining the pushing and shoving match going on all around us. All the way back to our hotel there were people selling t-shirts and souvenirs that got cheaper the further away from the venue you get! The T-shirts were $25 on the way in, $10 on the way out, and $5 half a block from our hotel! They also have street stands selling great (and cheap) bacon wrapped hotdogs as you walk back to the hotel. Be sure to check out the church on the corner of Franklin and Highland Ave...they offer ""no stack"" parking at a good price and the money goes to charity. Across the street is a gas station, and across the street the other way you will see a Subway Sandwich Shop...that is where we got our picnic dinner. It was better than the vendor food at the Bowl and a lot cheaper. Next time we want to try the restaurant at the Bowl...even though it is fairly expensive. Another perk of staying at the Hilton Garden Inn is that it is within walking distance of Hollywood Blvd with the Wax Museum, Ripley's, etc just an easy walk away. The Inn charges $36 parking. Not great, but typical of LA and it saves you parking at the Bowl or to see the attractions on Hollywood Blvd. One last tip...the traffic getting to this section of Los Angeles is always packed, so drive in really early if possible because an accident delayed us over 45 minutes and there is no time of the day when you don't encounter traffic.",PJ F
50,Best concert venue.,"I love the Hollywood Bowl. I've been coming here since I was a kid. I now live in Arizona and still make the trek to see Artists that don't make a stop in Phoenix. The food offerings are always good but pricey, however you are allowed to bring in your own refreshments. The sound and atmosphere are amazing. It's just my favorite place to see a show.",azsunspot
50,Amazing night!!,"We went to see West Side Story and it was a gorgeous night! We paid less for the higher up seats, but with the screens we could see everything! What we didn't know was we could bring food & drink in to venue! That would have been good to know! So if you are planning to go bring drink of your choice and all the food you want to enjoy a lovely evening! Do not buy your food there as it is very expensive and not the best!",familyoffourkansas
20,Are They Kidding?,"Ok, I get it - this is one of those ""legendary"" concert venues so I guess one should cut it some slack, but... My wife and I and two friends went to Sting/Peter Gabriel's show last night. The performance and sound were great. Getting IN and OUT of the venue was a nightmare. The place is surrounded by ""Stack"" parking lots (meaning you drive in and are wedged between cars and you don't leave until all the drivers in front of you leave. sounds like fun, right?) We parked a few blocks away, lugging food, etc. for a picnic. after ten mins of walking you are funneled into a security check, then a ticket stamp, THEN you're in the venue. Want a t-shirt? long lines. How about a beverage (as this event's promoter didn't allow bottles or cans)? Sure - get in another LONG line and be prepared to pay big bucks (like $85 for a bottle of mediocre wine and two small bottles of water). We had $250 ""Garden"" seats - which allowed us to sit in a teeny pen with two fold down tables. Fortunately you can order drinks from the overworked waiters and eventually you'll get served. (Not their fault, everybody was ordering.) Dinner done, you flip your seats around and enjoy the show... unless the couple next to you decide to dance right in front of you, then you bob your head like a prize fighter trying to see the stage. I observed a huge guy in the next session who stood up during every song, blocking the people behind him. Several went over to ask him to sit so they could see - he refused and mocked them with his popcorn. Typical Cali ""Me me me"" behavior. The show was great, but once over, a MAD rush for the exits and a long walk out, dodging the motorists trying to get out of the area. No thanks, I'm one and done with this place!",PanAm007
30,Hollywood Bowl Transportation Review,"We have utilized the Hollywood Bowl Park and Ride shuttle buses on two occasions and in two locations: Westwood and Lakewood. For the Peter Gabriel/Sting concert in July 2016 we parked at Lakewood and took the 55 minute shuttle to the Bowl. Buses were ready and filled up quickly, departing as soon as full. Traffic was fairly bad and the ride took 65 minutes, with the air conditioning only putting a dent in the afternoon heat. Our fellow passengers opened windows, which helped somewhat. The return bus got the job done a little more quickly since there was less traffic at 10 pm. The system of loading buses is well handled by Bowl staff and the drivers are great.",LJHSViking
20,Never again!,"This venue is a nightmare! I've seen concerts in many different venues (concert halls, stadiums, outdoor amphitheaters) and this one might be the worst. It's a fairly large venue but the seating (largely wood benches) is uncomfortable and tight (both side to side and front to back). Moving across the benches to get to your seat is difficult and is made nearly impossible if there is anyone already sitting in the same row. Moreover, the picnic style atmosphere (you're allowed to bring in food, bags, etc), leads to additional seat space being taken up by food containers. Front to back, there's a good chance you'll also get hit in the back of the head if anyone stands up during the concert.Getting in and out of the venue is even worse. The exit points are quite narrow and limited from each level and the main exit points at the bottom of the hill (where everyone needs to exit), funnels the entire audience into a small corridor with cars and then pushes most of them into an underground tunnel. It's a horrible experience and I hate to think what would happen if there was ever an emergency where people needed to clear out quickly.",GeoR-SD
40,"Great venue, especially for 4th of July","We went here for 4th of July celebrations, they had ""Chicago"" playing with the L.A Philharmonic. Great sound for such a large outdoor venue. All the seats are outside either pew style seats or boxes set for 2 or 4 people. The boxes for 4 are a little small but the deck chair seats are more comfortable than the wooden pews. Be prepared for long lines to get in as well as for food and drinks, although they do move steadily. The food inside the venue is much better than the food vans on the way in but as with most venues of this kind it's expensive. The weather was good but take a jacket at night as it gets cool. The music was good & so were the fireworks, a great atmosphere & great night.",sm05060
30,"Great to See a Show There, but the Museum is Not the Best Use of Your time.","There is going to the Bowl and then there is the Museum. If you are going to a concert, the Bowl is great. It is outdoors, comfortable, great sound and fun. But this review is about touring the Bowl and its little museum when a concert is not on.When visiting Los Angeles, there are so many things to do, there are great museums. This is not really one of them. It has an interesting history so if you like that, by all means go. However, it is really a concert venue with a lot of seats and a pretty stage and that is great when you are there for a concert.I thought the tour might be of interest. For me at least, I found it boring and was happy to be on my way.",elizabethlascheid
40,THE BEST OF AN OUTDOOR MUSIC VENUE.,"A great place to spend an evening under the stars with really good music. The greats and not so greats have all performed here. It is LA classic along with The Greek Theatre. Bring food and picnic. No matter where you sit, the acoustics are fantastic. Parking can be problematic so get there early and be prepared for a slow exit.",TravelAgentDave
50,Amazing venue to hear live music!,"If you are in town and the bowl is in season, it is a great place to go for a show. They have many music options so it can be great as a family stop, a date, or anything in between. I have been to many shows here ranging from movie screenings (with live music), classical, rock, etc. Always a great place. BYOB on Hollywood Bowl Events too which is great. We always bring a lot of food and wine to make the shows that much better!",Matias S
50,"Fun, fun, fun","We had tickets to Garrison Keillor's final show. It was wonderful. Tip: don't drive. Parking is awful. There are low cost shuttles that are all over the Los Angeles area. We took the one from the Lakewood Mall. They had lots of buses ready at the mall. You will get there early and have plenty of time for a picnic. There are a lot of picnic areas. Most people go to the ones to the left of the marquee. There are 2 to the right. That's where we went. Bring your wine, cheese and a nice dinner.There are large screens on either side of the stage. The Bowl hold 17,500 people. No you won't see the musicians or singers up close. Be in a state of mind that it will be full, you'll be watching the monitor most of the time and you will have a great time.",SuzieeQ
50,MAGICAL!! Absolutely THE BEST Venue Anywhere!!,"If you have not been to the Bowl, go online and get tickets!! There is no better venue for a concert!! And don't let parking ""issues"" scare you away....yes, it is stacked parking (unless you do a park-and-ride in the area, which many do) - but it is a short wait in your car to reminisce about the wonderful event you just attended, and soon you are on your way home - very easy really. Once you arrive, there is a slightly uphill walk along a lovely pavement to the entrance, where you pass a couple food vendors and also find the box office and a gift store. Once inside, you can take the moving walkway or the winding path to your level of seats. And there are SO many food choices in ALL price ranges -- more than ever before. If you have chosen a box seat (sharing a box with 3 to 5 other people) you can pre-order delicious appetizers, salads, entrees, wines, desserts and be served in your seat. You can also order such fare in picnic boxes and take them to any seat in the amphitheater. And you can bring your own food AND wine to most events (alcohol must be bought inside instead at the leased events) and picnic in your seat or outside - many people do. There is NO bad seat in this venue. There is bench seating, Super Seat seating, Box seating, Pool Circle seating (there was a pool once upon a time right by the stage). Every seat, even the ""view obstructed"" seats in 2 tiny sections on the side are really fine, and each area affords a slightly different experience. Plus, there are several jumbo screens the whole time, so you see close-ups of the show. Dining al fresco among the tall trees with the hum and buzz of people talking and laughing and the shared anticipation of the event still to come...what is better than that?? Nothing!",LCMSS
50,Awesome Romantic Venue,"Came here for a concert on my anniversary, got box seats with a table, had a nice picnic dinner with wine, thoroughly enjoyed the show.

40,Always a favorite,"Been a while since I'ld been to the Hollywood Bowl, However it was an enjoyable evening. Went for the fourth of July. Good music, open air on a pleasant evening, fireworks were good though not a WOW. Tickets were very reasonable. If you go to the Hollywood bowl make sure to take advantage of the shuttles as parking is a nightmare. And if you hate crowds this is not the place for you. Otherwise it is a terrific evening that I would recumbent to anyone.",Iam K
50,Great place to see a concert,We saw Chicago in concert and had garden seats so we could have a nice snack before the show began. The show was great and the sound was terrific. A classic venue to visit. We really enjoyed it.,Neil T
40,Besuatiful music expereince and terrible shuttle trip!,The 4th of July experience at the bowl was crowded but a terrific music experience. The shuttle all the websites suggest using was awful! It was not the shuttle company's fault but due to traffic a 5 minute ride from Hollywood and Highland took 40 minutes! We missed dining with our family group and were very stressed by the time we got there. My suggestion-- (no stack) park at the Methodist Church and walk (10 mins).,Pamela M
50,What An Experience!,"The Hollywood Bowl is unlike any other entertainment venue. Imagine an outdoor venue that seats 17,500 people. Everyone brings their own picnic dinner including alcohol. Some eat in their seats, some on lawns, some at tables. At 7:30, the orchestra begins to play and the first fireworks are displayed. What a fantastic way to celebrate the Fourth of July! Everyone is relaxed. People talk to their neighbors. The music is exceptional. The fireworks were the best ever?",Jane H
50,What makes a perfect summer evening,"Even if it is sometimes cool or busy ( aka July 4th) outdoor dining followed by a concert in this magnificent amphitheater is truly one of the gems of Los Angeles. Whether a long time resident , visitor or in between , settle down, don't worry about the big bucks for seats close in as the sound is terrific wherever you are. If fireworks are also on the menu it's a wonderful bonus and a memorable evening",Andy K
50,WOW WOW WOW! Loved it so much we went 3 times!,"For an event venue, you don't get any better than the Hollywood Bowl. We saw a concert, the Sound of Music Singalong and the Little Mermaid Disney event. What a venue! You can't imagine how fun this is for a concert, and the weather was perfect each time. This is a fabulous event venue and truly special. Don't miss it!!",e_recruiter
40,Outdoor Summertime Entertainment,"This is my summer entertainment place of choice. Each summer I take a Hollywood Bowl designated ""park 'n ride"" bus from Cerritos Mall on Candlewood. Recently it was the farewell to ""Prairie Home Companion,"" but other summers have included Brian Wilson, Diana Ross, Grace Jones and a slew of classical concerts some ending with fireworks accompanying the ""William Tell Overture""! You can pay a bundle (I have paid $100 for an ""Orchestra"" level seat at a table for four), or most recently $35 somewhere in the middle on a bench. The addition of big screen monitors magnifies the ant-like performers to bigger-than-life, but I regularly pack my opera glasses so I can focus on whatever I want to see. It's a super place for a birthday party, picnic, family reunion, or hanging out with friends. Although the bus tix have really jumped in price, but ""leaving the driving up to us"" eliminates the stacked parking & past 12 am arrivals back to Orange County. The atmosphere us festive & most if the time your fellow concert-goers are considerate & friendly & may even invite you to share a glass of Merlot!",Roxanne Y
50,LA icon,"irs one of the best place to be on Fourth of July. Plenty of fireworks. You can bring wine and foods there to picnic. Parking is $20 or you can park farther away and uber there. I prefer the latter which is cheaper, faster, and less stress. Inside the venues are fantastic too ranging Playboy jazz to rock concert by artists such as Train, Smokey Robinson and Maroon 5.",Bogard C
40,Potentially A Great Night Out!,"We went here for the July 4th Spectacular with Chicago. Chicago is a band that has been around since I was a child. They were as good as ever! Since this was over July 4th weekend they also had fireworks (other performances here don't have fireworks).They did a nice job with the fireworks in what is a relatively small space compared to some other fireworks shows.The Hollywood Bowl is a beautiful venue. It is outdoors so hopefully when you go the weather is nice. On this night it was very hot out, but since our seats in the P3 section were in the shade (by 7:30 PM) the sun and heat were not an issue. I have been here at other times, seated in other sections, when the heat was an issue. As with anywhere in California always bring a light jacket as the temperature after dark can sometimes drop quickly, especially in winter.Our show opened with some songs from the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Then the band Chicago played many of their favorites such as Saturday in the Park, 25 or 6 to 4 etc. They did a great job. Then the Philharmonic played some patriotic songs while we watched the fireworks.I recommend not parking directly at the Hollywood Bowl for several reasons. If you park in one of their lots your car may be surrounded by other cars and you may need to wait for others before you can leave. Also traffic around the Bowl can be a nightmare. You are better off taking one of the Bowl shuttles (as we did) or using one of the Park & Ride buses. The Bowl shuttle we used left from Studio City. There are 2 lots very close by (The Ventura Lot and The Ventura Annex Lot). The cost was $6 per person roundtrip. See the Hollywood Bowl website under Getting There for details.Alcohol and food items are permitted. Large coolers are not permitted (small ones are ok). They also sell food and drinks there.If those around you are not too drunk (we had a group of ladies behind us who were a bit smashed) and you don't get caught in too much traffic (take the shuttle) there is the potential here for a great night out!",JohnB00007

50,ahhhmazing,i love concerts at the hollywood bowl! the venue is the best place to see a live performance. its also great you can bring in your own food and wine and have a little picnic.,lynn l
50,Great music Great wine,"First time at the Hollywood Bowl for The Cure concert. It was awesome! This is a great venue! We'll definitely be back.The wine bar inside is also very good. We had yummy tapas style dinner and of course some delicious wine. I always love outdoor seating, so that was a big plus!Only gripe is the parking. It's a NIGHTMARE! Next time we are there we will park outside of the venue.",Gloria A
40,Reggae night fest. 2016,I've been living in the LA area my whole life and it was my first experience here. It was a fun. I felt like a tourist. You can bring your own food and drinks which is highly recommended and have a picnic. The bowl is awesome great view no matter where you sat. There are big screens and the music can be heard. It was fun to go with friends and have a good time. Like the others said take the park and ride shuttle from the many bus lines offered in the LA area. It will save you the traffic headache. $7 online purchased ahead and $12 at the lot round trip. It's best during summer nights. I plan on checking out the museum too.,Luv2travelnlaugh
50,Magic In The Hills,"The Hollywood Bowl is nothing short of magic. Nestled in the hillside of the Hollywood hills, this outdoor amphitheater takes you away from the maddening crowd of Los Angeles traffic. The acoustics are good and the starry nights meld with the romantic sounds of beautiful music. The fireworks show is spectacular and lends itself for a perfect experience. Look at their schedule and plan for an evening of enchantment.",Deborah Lynn T
50,Arrive Early!,Traffic and parking for a big event is a very real thing. Allow at least an hour to park. Be smart and get priority parking if you can. Don't stop at a bar to get your drinks if you are in a box. They have very efficient waiters.,Shelby C
50,I'm in love with the Hollywood Bowl!,"Whether you like the classics in the summer on Tuesdays or Thursdays (our preference) or pop and jazz acts (and even staged musicals) on the weekends; all with close-up monitors of the players and conductors on bookended screens, this is a cool place to be. Aside from sunset picnicking before the concert, come early in the day to visit the museum which tells wonderful stories about the luminaries who made the music come alive at the Bowl. The giftshop, aside from music books and CDs has everything from piano covers to sweatshirts to batons with the Bowls' logos.If you're older and your legs are not up to the climb, the Bowl offers escalators and even golf carts to get to your seats in good shape.Listen for the obligatory wine bottle rolling down the cement steps during a particularly quiet and delicately serene moment in the music…its all part of the charm of this L.A. landmark.",eggcreamer
10,BEWARE OF BRINGING CHILDREN HERE,"THe venue is in a beautiful setting but goodness ends there. There was more pot and other smokings going on than in Greenwich Village. There is a lot of cursing and alcohol is EVERYWHERE. Garbage is all over the place 15 minutes after the concert starts. Acoustics are not great. I saw Steely Dan, a over-the-hill duo even a full orchestra coud not bail out.",saul b
50,Opening night 2016,"I had never been to the Hollywood Bowl before in spite of having lived in the Southern California area for years. I'm so very glad I made the effort to go. The Bowl is beautiful, the acoustics wonderful and the seats comfortable. It was a lovely evening, not too cold. We had great seats in Section H. The food & wine purchased there wasn't good so I'll definitely plan to bring my own next time. I highly recommend this venue.",stainedglasslass
50,Great Experience.,"You really can't get much better than the Bowl. Such a lovely time, regardless of the show. Wonderful atmosphere and always a great show. Relax and enjoy!",Teresa P
40,Still a great place to see a show!,"I saw a Tribute to John Williams' movie scores here and it was a fantastic show! They played the Star Wars theme, the Indiana Jones theme, the Superman theme and it was wonderful. Only problems where the sort of confusing seating arrangements (I sat on a bench) and that I nearly got lost on the way to the Bowl itself, but once the show starts there is nothing to complain about!",Chris M
40,Love seeing shows here,"Great concert venue whether you're seeing shows from the first row or the last. Nothing beats the view of the stage before a show with the Hollywood sign hanging behind it in the background. It's especially nice that you're able to bring your own food and drinks to non-lease events here, lending to a relaxed, social party atmosphere.The stacked parking here is not advisable. I would recommend picking up the bus from one of the Bowl's Park and Ride lots around the city. Find locations on their website.",Jason H
50,Awesome venue,Loved The Hollywood Bowl - we came here to watch The Little Mermaid and the venue made it! Sitting under the stars was lovely. My advice - get there early as the queues of traffic were huge and meant we were nearly late. And you can rent cushions for $1 which I would recommend!,Danni
50,Great Place to See a Concert,"The Hollywood Bowl is beautiful. It is an outdoor theater and most of the seats are great. If you are on a budget you can usually get bench seats at about 50$ each with tax, etc. Never, ever, buy from a scalper.The one huge drawback to the Bowl is the parking. It is stacked parking and it will take you an hour to get out of the lot. There are places you can eat that will keep your car and take you to and from in a shuttle. There are also other areas for parking, but it is a bear and if you are handicapped, it really is not fair or fun to try to get from your car to your seat.The sound is excellent and you can even bring a basket of food if you like (no glass).If you are ever in town check to see what is up at the Bowl. You will love it.",elizabethlascheid
50,The Hollywood FishBOWL,"It was the first time I ever visited The Hollywood Bowl and it was AMAZING! I sat in the nosebleed section but that didn't matter. The layout allows everyone to have a great view and experience! If it is your first time there a sweater will be needed, for the venue is an open venue and it get really cold. Outside food and drinks are welcomed and there are plenty of picnic areas to enjoy your snacks! If picnic isn't your thing? Then the venue offer food options to satisfy your hunger!There is a downside to the venue and that is they do stacking style parking. Other than that the Hollywood Bowl was an awesome experience!",Yvette M
50,Paul Simon in concert!!,"This has to be on every music fans bucket list ? The concert was amazing and the venue iconic, my advice take the park and ride",Chris T
50,Absolutely beautiful venue and experience,"I've never had an issue at the Bowl and I've enjoyed every experience so much. It's an LA landmark, and I find that anyone who complains about it is usually complaining about the parking. Simply put: You don't park at the Bowl or close to the Bowl unless you want to pay $40+ dollars. You walk, take a cab, or carpool. Period. Expect to walk a lot at this venue. There's tons of bathroom stalls and it's wonderfully staffed and laid out. So easy to find your seat, and even when you're sitting in the back 40 as we usually do, there isn't a bad view in the house. Bear in mind that the steps get very steep the higher you go up. Amazing acoustics and backdrop of the Hollywood sign and canyons. Take in at least one show in your lifetime at the Bowl. It's an awesome experience.",annaaltheide
50,Beautiful Venue,Our most recent visit to this venue was June 4th for the Little Mermaid Live in concert. It was our 3rd time here and it is always a beautiful experience. The energy that fills this place is indescribable and the sound here is amazing. You can pack your own food/drinks and picnic here. There isn't a bad seat in the house. Parking is terrible if you choose to park in one of their lots because it is all stacked parking. So I'd park further and just walk. If you ever have the opportunity to see a concert here don't wait on getting tickets as most of their events are sell out shows. Also arrive early because traffic is a nightmare on event nights.,marsbar112
20,Totally Disappointing Experience ... Never Again,"We were so thrilled to be given tickets as a XMAS present to Andrea Bocelli's concert at the Hollywood Bowl on June 5, 2016. Six month's of anticipation culminated in a very stressful experience in a very disappointing venue.A. Getting there/Parking1. Traffic on the 101 was heavy as usual2. The Highland turnoff was not policed or barricaded, and many cars jumped the line and cut in, even buses. It took 1/2 hour to go 100 yards. Needs a police presence.3. Once off 101 in the queue, the two cops directed you into parking lots that were stacked 4 deep. If the owner of the car in front of you went to a bar after the concert, you'd be stuck for hours. Unconscionable way to herd cars. Parking is grossly inadequate.4. We drove through the cops and valet parked at the Holiday Inn for $40. There may be other lots on other streets for those who know the neighborhood. Parking in the designated lots by the Bowl would be a nightmare.B. The Venue1. Uphill, lots of walking, not suited for the handicapped or elderly. Saw one golf cart carrying young well-heeled females.2. Hillside arena is huge, individual seats stop early, majority seating is a hard wooden bench, thankfully with a backrest.3. Large screens in each section provide TV close-ups of performers and orchestra on stage. Very nice.4. During the entire intermission the screens flash only ""Drink Responsibly"" and ""Smoking Only in Designated Areas""; they lose a huge opportunity to advertise future Bowl dates and performers; a waste of time and effort. One would think this world-famous venue would be better at promotion and entertaining it's attendees at halftime. We were interested to know what else might be coming up. It's a captive audience of 17,500. Sell them something ! Very disappointing.5. Many, many people were lined up for wine, popcorn, and other refreshments in long, long lines - indicating insufficient service stations and servers. Surprisingly disappointing. Much lost potential revenue. Many frustrated attendees. Poor planning.Again, surprising failure on the part of a world-famous venue.C. Bocelli's Concert1. Not a word of introduction. Not a word from Andrea Bocelli himself, never said hello, glad to be here, kiss my _ _ _ .2. Sang two songs, then a female violinist played two songs, then him again for 2 or 3 , then a female for one, then him, then 20 min intermission ... after just 37 minutes.3. One time the screen flashed the music score so one could see the title of the song. One time. Never again. Some tunes familiar, others not. The artist and the venue missed a grand opportunity to educate the audience and help them know the music being song or played. Gross disservice to the attendees.Getting out was a nightmare. Heavy traffic jam complicated by impolite or drunk people. Not enough traffic police for control or roads to use to get out. Not anxious at all to return. A most disappointing experience, especially considering the cost; would not recommend this venue to anyone regardless of the event.",David G
50,A Unique Experience.,"I have been here for two concerts and two graduations. It is acoustically amazing a huge bowl facing a box canyon. For concerts take a shuttle such as the one behind Ross on Fulton and Woodman in Sherman Oaks you can find other locations on line. Otherwise mass transit is good too, you can drive but parking is stacked it took us about 45 minutes to get out after Cold Play in '14. For smaller events like graduations parking is fine.If you buy tickets you may want to pay more to sit in the boxes, you can bring a picnic dinner and wine, you will be enveloped in sound and nobody screaming our singing behind you. It is worth it.",Louis D
50,"FABULOUS VENUE, MUSIC, FIREWORKS","When in LA, one should not miss watching a concert in Hollywood Bowl in the summer. Spectacular! You can have a picnic there; bring your own food and drinks. Or dine at their restaurant. Great summer concerts (open seating) with amazing fireworks on selected ones. We're always there for the July 4th concert with family and it's like a family tradition now. Even in September, there are still concerts with fireworks. We always bring seat cushions bec the ones they rent out always run out early. Taking the shuttle is a better option than driving your own car. Convenient and stress free. Parking there is a always big challenge. Check their website for available times and areas to take them. LOTS OF FUN & A MUST IN LA!!!",rosario308
40,Great venue,I went to Andrea Bocelli concert. I liked the place and the weather was great. The only problem was at the end of the concert everybody trying to get out it was awful. I did enjoyed it though.,unitedxf
40,Great experience,We just saw the Little Mermaid and it was a great production. The venue was great and the in seat staff were very attentive. My only complaint would be that you should have more kid friendly foods. It was frustrating to wait in line for over a half hour for a hot dog and pretzel for my 2 & 6 year olds only to be told you ran out at 8pm which was showtime. We ended up having to feed our kids popcorn for dinner. But I also understand that there are not a lot of kids who usually attend concerts here.,greggfi626
20,Nice Acoustics - A Nightmare to Enter and Exit,"I attended a concert at the Hollywood Bowl on Wednesday, June 1st, 2016. Whatever you do, do not, I repeat, do not drive there. We stayed at a nearby hotel on N. Highland Avenue and walked to the venue.The bowl was built in the 1920's before Los Angeles had the number of cars and traffic it does today. Because it is built in a hillside, there is also no way to expand it.There is one driveway to enter the venue and one driveway to exit the venue and both pedestrians and vehicles have to share those two driveways coming and going. All the people dodging all the traffic is scary and dangerous.The acoustics are amazing and we had comfortable seats in one of the Terrace boxes. The bowl also has large monitors so everyone can see the performers.The difficulty entering and exiting the venue was so stressful I will never attend another performance there.If you decide to go, plan ahead and do not drive.",Patricia M
20,"Andrea Bocelli ""lease event""","I was disappointed with the lack of published information of a ""lease event"" at the Hollywood Bowl June 5th, 2016. - Andrea Bocelli.We ordered sit down served dinner in a private box. Dinner is served 2 hours prior to performance. The gates to the venue did not open until 1.5 hours prior to the performance. My mother with a broken hip stood in line for 45 minutes. The catered sit down dinner was confused with the different couple, and the box that was supposed to be for 4 people turned out to be for 6 people. The usual bottles of wine were disallowed as we found out when we pulled into the parking lot. However, you could buy a bottle fro $40-$700. Interesting.All should be published along with the ticket!However, Andrea Bocelli was wonderful.",Justvera
50,"What a night, I WAS where the people are!","I visited the Hoolywood bowl last night for the first time and I'm so happy to be going again tonight, ( I know - I'm a fangirl for a certain anonymous person 😍). I sat in H row 19 116 I think. Right in the middle anyway. Great veiw for photographs. Not so great if you need to see the actual performer in the flesh, but the screens help with that. The atmosphere is wonderful. It was a Disney concert so the audience were a mix of old right down to very young. People eat picnics while the concert is playing. But you have to have factory sealed bottles or they make you throw them away. It costs 4 dollars for a bottle so don't open it. Until you are in, saying that the soda you buy there is 4.75 and you can take that in. My god it was a wonderful show. ( little mermaid in concert). The veiw when it's dark, from the right there is a light up cross, must be on a church some where, the sky has a light from each side that makes a kiss sign above your head, the fire works. My goodness, the fire works. Now I could of walked back to sunset boulevard, but my friend has a sore ankle. The shuttle from the Chinese theatre was great 6 dollars return, but on our way back the queues are big. Ok for me stressful for some families with small kids. 17000 people are a lot to get moving on. But we got there. If you can tell I'm still on cloud nine. Just loved every blooming minute of it! X ps. It does get cold even if you were sunbathing during the day!",DebDuckworth
40,"Always a fun time, mostly --","Classic venue with great sight lines, good acoustics, fun atmosphere, very interesting mixture of patrons, especially with certain performers - but terrible waiting lines (especiailly women's rest rooms) and bad parking issues.

40,Best Concert Ever,"Two friends and I attended The Cure concert on a pleasant May evening. We splurged for Garden Box seats for this special occasion and were thrilled that we did. The venue is huge - much larger than I expected. Our view of the performers was terrific. I expect even sitting in the seats farther back would be tons of fun if one can't afford more expensive seats. The garden seats have 4 foldable seats and 2 foldable tables within the box. Servers will take orders for food and drinks to save you the hassle of standing in line and carrying everything. For this particular show, no alcohol could be brought in. Our server was quite busy and we often went to get the food ourselves. The lines to the left of the stage were not as bad as those to the right (although it was quite long just before the start of the show. There were plenty of restrooms (at least on the left side of the stage). I never had to wait for the ladies room. The sound was terrific and the crowds energy at this famous place was incomparable. I cannot wait to return with my kids (teenagers). We stayed at the nearby Roosevelt Hotel and walked the 1 mile to and from the show. It was fun because of the whole crowd walking with us. (However, the crowds seemed almost too much for the amount of space leading to the entrance of the Bowl; fortunately there was lots of police and security). I suggest parking in the public lots around Hollywood Blvd. (near Dolby theater) if you're not being dropped off or staying at a nearby hotel.",AngelaJeanne

50,The One and Only Hollywood Bowl.,"Best place in SoCal to see a live show outdoors. I attend the Playboy Jazz festival and at least two additional shows every summer. It is a venue that allows you to enjoy L.A. weather while listening to music from some of your favorite artists. Combine that with the fact that you can bring your own food and beverages, INCLUDING ALCOHOL, and the Hollywood Bowl just can't be beat. If you're from out of town, and visiting L.A. during the summer months, the Hollywood Bowl is a MUST. Trust me, you won't be disappointed and chances are, will want to visit again.",arejaydoubleyou
10,Worst Concert Venue,"My fiance and I traveled to LA to see the Cure. The whole area is really difficult to maneuver around, so wear your ugly or at least comfortable shoes. We could not enjoy the seats we paid for because our neighbors were very large and rude. There is zero booze sold inside, kind of like a cheap wedding beer and wine only. Don't even get me started on their security team, who harassed us all night for standing up against a wall. We left almost an hour early. Horrible experience. If you must go only get tickets right up front, or hang on the grass in the back.",RedBettie
50,Great Experience!,"I had the best time. My first time here and loved it. Beer & wine offered. Plenty of food, and a lot to choose from at any level. Nice picnic areas to eat. Escalators to take you up to top levels. Music sounds great there! Just beautiful, I had the time of my life!",Teresa H
50,Take the shuttle and bring a picnic....,"I can't say enough about my visit to see The Cure in May 2016. Super Seats were fantastic! They might not be as close to the stage, but the sound was really good, and the Super Seats have backs and arm rests! it was a great alternative since I wasn't able to afford seats in the lower sections.Getting to the Bowl was a breeze by doing the park and ride from Pasadena. Quick and easy loading, and we were dropped off at the front gate. So Easy!Leaving the show was just as easy.... Immediate loading on the bus, and we were away from the venue just as quickly as we got on the bus. Back to Pasadena, before my friend (who parked at the Bowl) was even out of the parking lot!Getting there and back couldn't have been easier!Another great tip... Pack a picnic and grab a table in the picnic area just to the left of the escalator that takes you up the hill. We sat at a picnic table for an hour eating our food, and enjoying the scenery.The whole experience was fantastic and I can't wait to see another show here!",alan b

50,The Hollywood Hills are Alive with the Sound of Music,"The Hollywood Bow epitomizes the overall idea of the entertainment experience that one would expect to have in the 'capital of performance'.This venue is elegantly surrounded by nature and is the perfect way to experience music as the sunsets and moonrises.The entertainment lists vary depending on your music of choice, from Classical artists like John Williams, Jazz, World music or Electronica, (the last show I saw featured Empire of the Sun, and they absolutely ""Killed"").Be prepared for the season which kicks into high gear around Juneish and runs all the way through to around September. Its a total treat celebrating the fourth of July in the Bowl... the music, the lights and fireworks will turn anyone into a Patriot in no time.Get to the area early as parking is in high demand but its also a great way to get in a few hundred steps as you make your way to your seats. Then enjoy the picnic basket you brought along. (I recommend bringing a cushion to sit on. Note cushions can be rented also) Add a few friends to enhance the festivities. This is also a perfect opportunity to bring children and introduce them to the Art of sound. Guaranteed you will walk away with making new acquaintances too because the atmosphere is so positive and electric it is so easy to be switched on by it all.When you leave you will be making plans to set up another date!!!!!",edenrox10

I recommend taking the subway and walking up the hill...or take one of the shuttles they provide.What a great trip that would be for an out of towner.

40,Great venue but choose your seats carefully,"As a concert venue the Hollywood Bowl is fantastic. It is true when they say there are no bad seats. With the exception of leaving after the show. Our seats were in section Q2 and the only way in/out is on the opposite corner of the venue. That is not ideal if you want to leave the concert in good time.Additionally traffic around the bowl is terrible! We waited for an hour after the concert for Uber and eventually wound up walking back to our hotel after 2 drivers gave up.That said, we would visit for another concert there in a heartbeat. My advice is to plan out your arrival and departure carefully and you will have a great time.",Deana L

There were as one would expect long lines to buy beer, and way too long lines for the Men's Room. Surprisingly, lines for the Women's Room were modest.The Amphitheater shell was a nice canvas for the light and pyrotechnics show that were a part of the experience.Most impressive was the quality of the sound, even way back where we were seated.",scan1man
30,Iconic Venue- but parkings a real b.,"Everyone should go to the bowl at least once to see a big act. The immensity of the venue, just the way it's set up, and it's surprisingly good acoustics for an outdoor concert location make it a good spot to catch a show.

Whether it's a romantic evening,or with a gang of friends.. picknicking before show on the grounds, Superseat snacking, or upfront dinning... It's all good! Big screens help even the cheap seats see everything. Remember to either Park & Ride from many convenient locations or take the Metro Redline to Highland & Hollywood for best hassle-free experience.

40,Love and hate it but it's an experience,"I LOVE and hate Hollywood Bowl. We've been to different events from sing along, fire works, classical, and Korean Music Festival. Once you get here and settle it's all fun. Getting here is another matter.Hate:Line gets backed up. You have to get stacked into the parking. You get stacked into get in. Then if you decide to leave early, well your out of luck. You're stuck. For those who take the bus, well from LA Zoo location, parking is free, but buses are packed and you'll be standing to and from. And same with if you want to leave early.Those are all hate stuff.LOVE:Once you get here with your picnic lunch/dinner and some drinks (all the events I've been to so far allows you to bring alcoholic beverages) you're set for the night of enjoying the venue. Ambiance is relaxing. Well until there is an intermission then you have to deal with the long restroom line. I recommend you go before or after intermission. Just love it that it's outdoor, can bring our own food and drink to enjoy. There are picnic areas inside where you can enjoy your food before venue starts.Bit of tricks:With little kids in last couple venues, we usually hang out in the rear walk way with a blanket/chair and have room to spread out, kids can run around and climb walls and don't bother others.Again with little kids, I don't know when they'll want to leave, so we park at the Highland and Hollywood underground parking for the hotel. From there you can catch a shuttle or walk less than a mile to the bowl.Use the rear entrance...everyone just flock to first entrance they see.I wish whoever does the venue would invite some food trucks to the event. So far I have not attended an event with food truck. But attending Korean Music Festival, I wish they had food truck to go grab some grub throughout the event since it is a long one.",BigBoyA77

50,This Place Does It Right.,"Very relaxed, yet professionally run place. Absolutely stress free, w/great food and drink, plus you can bring your own into the venue. Get there early and picnic, or find a local happy hour and walk to The Bowl at your leisure. Ginormous beers for $5 and you don't have to leave your seats to get them (this may be only in box seats, though?). The venue itself is gorgeous, and the surrounding scenery, stunning. Everyone is polite and security aren't uptight or power trippy. Spring for the box seats if you can, as they're super comfy, great view, you can buy beer and wine right at your box from ushers/waiters, and exiting after the show is a lot easier. A happy experience all around. Oh, and did I mention how amazing the sound was? The sound was amazing :D A perfect California night.",TeeJG
40,Awesome Concert place,Huge venue. Outside so prepare for rain if necessary. People are fast when letting people in. DRINKS are NOT allowed. But you can buy inside.Parking wise - EXPENSIVE. Last time I checked it was $23.00. I did the Park and Ride where I only paid $7.00 back and forth to the place where it's free to park. So I don't have to deal with the traffic of Los Angeles.,The Brown Daredevil
40,Great venue,"With the many bus services that you can book to get to the Hollywood Bowl, it makes going to this great venue quite simple. Without the buses I would never go here. Saw Pink Martini in one of the best concerts I've ever attended.",UltimateWines
40,"Excellent Amenities, Comfort, Setting and Sound","This was our first time here. We've been to many venues and this is one of the finest.The main drawback to this venue is the location which imposes many logistical constraints. If you don't stay in the area at a local hotel like we did, then be prepared for endless traffic, stacked parking and hours of time spent getting to and from a show.This is one of the few venues that even at peak times, the bathrooms were able to handle the crowd for both men and women. Well done!Net-Net: I'd go back to see a show again.",Mr_Firestone
50,Great concert venue,This is a great venue to see concerts. The area is beautiful and there are many picnic areas that you can use prior to the event to have nice picnic dinner. We had some great seats and it was a magical night. We loved this venue so much we are looking to returning here for future concerts.,Stacey M
50,David Gilmour Show,It was a great day in Hollywood. I would recommend parking at the parking garage at Hollywood & highland grab something to eat and walk to the bowl. Patience is a must in Hollywood!! Drive as little as possible and wear some comfortable shoes. It is a little bit of a walk. It took us about 20 minutes at a slow pace. The sound is incredible and I would recommend visiting the bowl for a concert if you ever have the opportunity.,Rich M
50,Went here last 4th of July,"The 4th of July fireworks show is awesome. We had box seats and they were wonderful. The acoustics are fantastic and the Los Angeles evenings in the summer can be outstanding. If you haven't been to the Bowl, it is time to go.",David R
50,Love the Bowl,"The Hollywood Bowl is an iconic entertainment venue. We love going to concerts there. Bring a picnic dinner--there are lots of picnic areas, or spend a lot of money on a box to have dinner at your seats. Also be sure to bring a blanket or warm jacket. It gets pretty cool after the sun goes down. Parking is problematic but the Bowl is always worth it! Can't wait for the next season to start!",Leslie B
50,A Definite Must!!,"This is quintessential California at its best. This is so spectacularly unique to Southern California. In the summer time, they have a ton of concerts, classical music, world music, jazz music, fireworks spectaculars, etc. and the seats are all different price ranges. There are boxes (very hard to come by) where you can dine in your box, and lots of bench seats throughout. It is great fun to bring a picnic (there are lots of picnic areas and many are quite beautiful). Get there early if you want a picnic table to sit at. It is really special to sit out under the stars and listen to the music. It is just one of those very special things to do in California and makes for a very memorable evening. We have been to countless concerts and have always enjoyed ourselves. There are park and ride buses from various points throughout the City. If you drive, allow a lot of time to get there as the traffic is really heavy and it will definitely take you much longer than you anticipate. One of the nice things about having dinner there (they also have restaurants but you need reservations), is that by the time you have finished eating, you have forgotten about being stuck in traffic for two hours.",HappyTravelersJD
50,An experience not to be missed,"This open-air amphitheater is nestled in the Hollywood Hills, not far from the ""Hollywood Sign."" If you can get tickets to a concert in one of the boxes, your experience will be unforgettable. You can dine there alfresco on the food you bring, or you can order dinner to be brought to your table (I have never liked the food though). There are collapsible tables in the boxes and people who are skilled at setting them up. If you cannot get a booth there is bleacher seating for a much more reasonable price. Music varies according to the night you go - classical, jazz, rock - whatever you want to hear (assuming you will be there on the night it is performed). The performances are always first rate, and the musicians are often world renown. Performances are seasonal from early summer through early fall.",OCD2
50,The Bowl,"Its concert time again! if you enjoy live music the Hollywood Bowl is a definite must. Some of the best bands have played here. The acoustics of the bowl, the scenery, and the open air stadium seating provide a good seat for the show no matter where you are sitting.",Adrian D
50,My favorite place to see a show,"This is by far my favorite place to see a show in the summer! The history, the closeness and the outdoor under the stars feel is just amazing. it is a one of a kind experience that you must do while in LA during the summer!!",Chris S
40,Bring Your Own Food & Enjoy the Show,I love the environment here when you go to watch a show. It's awesome that you can pack your own food and booze and watch a good show. If you drink there just be responsible and not rowdy so they won't throw you out! And you can park in one of their lots further down and just get shuttled over to your car which is also a relief because the immediate parking lot can get really full. Be prepared to pay for parking!,Tamara V
50,No Equal To This Historic And Magnificent Venue,"What a perfect venue to go to and enjoy a concert, any concert. The venue is perfection from the seats to the stage to the atmosphere to the history. I have lived here for 45 years and I will never get used to the fact that I can go here and I can enjoy my favorite performers in all of this splendor, most recently I saw the incomparable JIMMY BUFFET here and I got to let the Parrot Head out of the cage and revel in Jimmy's world for a couple of hours.......FINS UP!!!!Parking is definitely a problem, take mass transit!",LovetogoCalabasas
50,This is the best venue for live concerts,"I have been going to the HB for 10 years and I keep coming back. Depending on the concert you can bring in your own ice chest with food and beverages. I highly recommend taking the shuttle, the shuttle drops you off right in front of the HB and takes you back to the designated parking area. You avoid traffic and high parking fees. The ticket prices aren't that bad either, I have sat in the box seats as well as the ""cheap seats"" and honestly, I have more fun in the back rows. See you there!",Ellisinla
40,Empire of the sun concert,"Great place to see a concert. Empire of the sun were amazing. Only downside were the amount of youngsters with bottles of liquor downing it as if there was no tomorrow. Bottles of vodka and whiskey being passed between youngsters was eye opening. The final straw for me was when youngsters lit up cannabis joints, the smell wafting over us was disgusting. I did tell them to stop but received a load of abuse. A fab venue spoilt by youngsters on a mission to get hammered.",jul2111
40,Iconic symbol worth a look,"We got an early start in LA since we were still on central time, so no traffic and we were all by ourselves walking around the Bowl at 8 am on a Friday morning. Lots of signs and pictures showing history so we really did not miss anything not going into the museum. Awesome to walk around",laculturevulture
40,A Fairly Low-Key Affair,The museum at the Bowl is a nice diversion but nothing to write home about. The real draw is seeing the empty amphitheater in the daytime - it's really quite lovely. Take a picnic and sit in the relative emptiness and get the hell out of there before the crowds descend.,Grandison K
50,The BEST for outdoor music entertainment!,"The Hollywood Bowl is the BEST venue for outdoor music entertainment. There are so many music choices to attend here. Pack a lunch, bring your own alcohol, and arrive early before the concert begins and you have the perfect setting for crowds or a date. So many five star entertainers have played on their stage. Plenty of parking but arrive early. There are also many bus schedules designated to bring you here as well. Each level have restrooms, an onsite memorabilia stand, and concession stands. The box seating can be hard to come by for they are usually taken by memberships only, but bleacher seating is plentiful. There is no lack for sound or viewing for a large screen displays the act and this venue is equipped with speakers throughout the property.",SamanthaTula
50,Spend one summer here and you'll never leave.,"I've been coming to the Bowl for over thirty years, and never has a disappointment. Now that I'm a member and buy season tickets, I don't see how could people live without coming to the hollywood bowl. The prices have gone up over the years, but memories you make here are priceless.",Emad A
20,Not accessible without a tour,"In past visits, I've been able to see this without being on a tour. But, the improve,nets and additions to the venue now prevent onlookers from seeing it without a guide. Bummer.",Travelingirl1967
50,Wow,We went to the Hollywood Bowl on visiting LA to see Blur (we are both british and therefore seeing one of our bands was great) the Hollywood Bowl was great luckily we had a beautiful warm evening (can imagine it might be a different experience in the rain as it is all outside) but was in owe of the venue and the views- was a brilliant experience and would recommend to visitors coming to LA. My favourite thing whilst in LA,Natalie S
40,The Bowl offers a good variety of performances.,"Getting to the bowl is a challenge but once there the performances are varied and quite good. The bench seats are very uncomfortable but you can rent a cushion for $1. The large screens scattered around are great as you can get a glimpse of what's happening on the stage even if you're sitting very far away. The boxes are very small with small tables that fold away. Food from Patina is OK but very pricey. The bus service is good and reasonable. All in all, we enjoy going to the Bowl a few times a year.",Luvsailing
50,Nice museum and good opportunity to explore the bowl area,"We visited the museum during the day and had the opportunity to explore the Hollywood bowl as well. We enjoyed all the photos, films, info sharing the history behind the bowl, along with its ups and downs through the years. It was fun to actually get out and explore the Hollywood bowl and get an idea of the immense size of the venue.",Stitchin'goddess

50,Amazing!,"fabulous venue to enjoy music, fun and food!the large video screens add to the entertainment experience",traveln2011
50,Great Outdoor Venue when the weather is good,Wonderful place to enjoy music outdoors in our Southern California climate. Good but pricey food options. Allowed to bring your own picnic to enjoy prior to event. I highly recommend you purchase shuttle transportation to avoid driving as leaving the venue can take a great deal of time.,Rachel G
50,Phish-bowl,"Boring, another stellar review of a classic venue. Wow, location, views, and acoustics and I've been to hundreds of concerts from the Kennedy center, Wolftrap, Madison Square Garden, Radio City, and this all that it is cracked up to be. The expectations are sooo high walking into this venue I expected some let down, but I can tell you.. I would rock out to anything at the Hollywood Bowl, from the Wiggles to bad country. Got ticket, will travel.",David B
30,HUGE VENUE!!,I've been here a few times to see concerts...and I pay a fortune for the seats...and they are always far away!! Not the best place to see a concert...tooooo big!!,afleetingmoment
40,Impressive,"We stopped by here on our way through the area. What terrific history. It is impressive to walk through the bowl and to hear someone speak in their normal voice from the stage and be able to hear them up at the top. It seats 17,500 people and i bet it is awsome to see a concert there.",Jim R
50,One of the best performance venues in the world,"No question about it..every show I have attended here has been amazing. The ambiance, location, amenities and production are always world class.",AntonyAdel
40,Beatles Exihibit,"The museum is really cool if you are a music enthusiast. if you're not, it is not that fun. I really liked it. They had a Beatles exihibit and I love them.

50,Etherial concert venue.,"Every seat is a good seat at the Hollywood Bowl. Not only do you get the experience of the show, but natural outdoor atmosphere is beautiful. Warning: parking can really suck- get there early.",Necole C
40,Great Place for a Concert,"This is a great place to hear a concert that is especially orchestral based. But, if that is not what you are seeing, others are good as well. Neil Diamond was excellent at this venue.Get there early for best parking and to get to your seat with ease.Plan on a long relaxing stay and be sure to wear good walking shoes. If you go when it can be cool in the night be sure to bring a sweater or a jacket.Then, relax and enjoy the concert.",Mary Jean

50,One of the Best Places in LA!,"My husband and I go all the time. Whats not to like, listen to wonderful music under the stars. I think they could do better on their food so we always take a picnic.",TwoAdventure
20,Plenty of bad seats,"My husband and I have decided not to go back to the Hollywood Bowl unless we can afford very good seats, like the box seats where you have your own table, or sit on the grass, because of our previous experience. A few years ago we bought tickets for a concert and the seats were in the long curved benches where you know which seats are yours by the faded painted number on the backrest part of the bench. It had been a little cool so we each had a light jacket and I had my purse. I'm 5'3'' about 140 pounds and my husband is 5'6'' about 150 and fit. We're not big people but my knees barely brushed the back of the seat in front of me and as others came in who had seats in our row we eventually had no room to either side of us. At one point my jacket fell on the ground and it was crazy trying to retrieve it because the back of the seat in front of me prevented my head and back from going lower than the length of my arm which was too short to reach the bottom! I finally got it but I then had to sit the entire time with my jacket and purse on my lap trying to keep them from slipping off. Also, when I asked if the usher could check to see if there were people in our row who didn't belong there (we were packed in like sardines!) he said he wouldn't be able to do that because he didn't have room to move down the row. It was not an enjoyable experience and for the cost of good seats at the Bowl there are too many other venues we can go to to get very nice seats, with cushions and arm rests attached! Whoo-hoo! When you factor in having to park a distance away and taking a bus in to the venue because parking is horrendous at the Bowl it just doesn't seem worth it to us to go there again.",FlashbackFour
50,Picnic with friends before enjoying Jazz under the stars,"Pack a big picnic dinner and join the crowds. Take a blanket to lay out on a walkway if you can't find a free bench or table. Enjoy your food as you visit with friends. Pack up and find your seats - the show is about to start! The bowl seats a lot of people, so you will need binoculars if you are half way back - but the bowl has large screens on both sides to help you see the show. All seats have good acoustics! You can park and ride from various lots in the valley.",Lee T
50,There is no Such Thing as a Bad Seat!,"A visit to Los Angeles is not complete unless you visit our magical outdoor concert venue--the Hollywood Bowl. Whether you see Barbra Streisand or Neil Diamond or just sing a long to the Sound of Music the experience is wonderful. The most wonderful part about the Bowl is that you can hear and see even from the very back. You can almost always get a seat to your favorite artist at a reasonable price. And, you get to pack your pick nick dinner. Often times we find ourselves sharing food with people we meet. The Bowl is an incredible experience.",todd e
50,Great outdoor amphitheater,"Beautiful venue, great sound. The bonus view of the Hollywood sign in the hills above is pretty sweet. You can also bring outside food in!",Marie R
50,"Great concert venue, and not bad for movies either!","We were so lucky to be able to see Danny Elfman's Halloween here at the Hollywood Bowl. Nightmare Before Christmas was shown on large screens with the songs performed live with the original cast vocalists and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Danny Elfman's sang Jack Skellington's parts after the movie was over there was another thirty minutes of musical performances including Dead Man's Party with special quest Steve Bartek.If you've never been to the Bowl, it can get quite chilly once it's dark, especially for fall or winter concerts. Dress in layers and bring a (heavier) jacket or blanket. Better to have and not need, than need and not have.Take public transportation if you can. Parking for us was $25 for stack parking and as luck would have it, our row and lot was the last to empty. Wasn't horrible, but could've been better.We had box seats so we went early with a lovely dinner of cold fried chicken, fresh fruit, drinks, and cookies for dessert. We also had candy since it was a Halloween show, there were trick-or-treating stations handing out candy. Servers are available to take food orders if you don't want to bring your own.All in all a really great evening, at a wonderful venue.",USC_Mare

50,The best concert venue in Southern California,"Outdoors admist the pine woods in the Hollywood Hills under the moonlight, the Hollywood Bowl has been hosting the best in music from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in 1960's to Radiohead, Oasis, John Mayer and Coldplay recently. Each summer a few rock bands play.I saw Steely Dan and Elvis Costello this year. The location outdoor setting takes advantage of the climate and Hollywood Hills forest of trees.",Tom R
50,Amazing,"This place is confusing when you have never been there before, and it's dark and your hammered....but just Hefner up and follow the crowd. Although the do not allow tailgating you can bring a picnic into the park before you enter the gates, and relax & meet up with friends. Keep the drink not obvious! And you will have no issue.

50,Hollywood Bowl - a must in summer,"You have to do the HB so you can experience a fabulous outdoor concert in the summer with mountains surrounding you. Seats range from very cheap to very pricey. Everyone can go here. Pack a picnic, bring a fancy restaurant ordered picnic, be served at the various places here, or be served really great gourmet food in one of the boxes.",Chi-Girl
50,Great for concerts,"I saw Jimmy Buffett at the Hollywood Bowl. I don't think there were any bad seats. We sat in the bench seat section. It wasn't too crowded or uncomfortable. Great night! We took the shuttle from the zoo, I highly recommend this.",Loreli H
40,"Great Venue, Points to Consider","This was a great venue for an outdoor concert. While we were in the middle of Hollywood, it felt like we were in a park. We stayed at the Hilton Universal City and we were only one subway stop away. That helped in not having to drive around Hollywood Blvd which was very congested. In hindsight we probably would have stayed at a hotel next to the Hollywood Bowl and walked there. We did get a bus from the mall on the corner of Hollywood and Highland however we could have walked there faster because of the traffic in the area. The venue itself can get tight with a crowd of people so keep that in mind when you are deciding whether to get food or drinks there. The line ups at the concession stands were extremely long and difficult to get through quickly. So we recommend bringing your water with you and then you can decide from there.",sbctravelers
50,Great Concert Fun,"Love the bowl, every experience I've had there has been great. Parking is not fun so get there early, eat, relax enjoy and you'll have no problem getting out. Restaurants are overpriced, but good food. Seats are worth the price of admission.",MrsVlaming
50,You haven't seen anything until you see this.,"It's amazing - it's large but feels intimate. The stage isn't big, there's large screens on either side of the stage. The sound is awesome, no echos. The best part is your outside, go early bring a picnic and watch sundown. If it's a show put on by the Hollywood Bowl - you can bring your own LIQUOR!! The food on sight is good, not amazing - but good.I don't recommend parking anywhere near the bowl, we walked from the train station at Hollywood Blvd. It was a leisurely 20 minute walk. On walk back we're moving faster than traffic - traffic was jammed all the way to Hollywood Blvd. and on every side street.Hollywood bowl is special place, if there's a show you'd like to see and you get the chance to see it here, you've got to go.",Mills R
50,Iconic LA stop,"It is criminal how long it took me to finally go see a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Easily one of my favorite venues to see anything-- it doesn't matter who you go to see, just being there is a blast.

I can't even guess how many times I've seen Monty Python at the Hollywood Bowl.When Van Halen announced that they were touring we checked to see if it was during our trip!

50,"Incredible experience, make the most of it.","The crowds can be overwhelming and the wait can be long and frustrating, but make the most of attending the Hollywood Bowl -- it's worth it. Enjoy the performance, it is enhanced by the surroundings!Bring a picnic lunch and eat in your seats before the concert or in one of the many little areas available just outside the Bowl. Thee are also many restaurants within the Bowl area. But be sure to not bring liquor of any kind in through the gates, they will confiscate it from you and it cannot be returned to you.We attended a concert by Andrea Bocelli concert. Even though we were in the upper bleachers we were able to appreciate the beauty of his voice and the other portions of the performance. However, next time I want to be closer. Even though I brought small binoculars, it was not the same as being closer to the stage.Parking is, at best a challenge. The lots are packed, expensive, and difficult to get out of at the end of the performance. We selected a parking lot away from the Hollywood Bowl. There are many a short walk away where clubs, restaurants, and even churches open the peaking to Bowl attendees for a smaller charge and no standing around and waiting.",Linda F
50,Amazing venue!! Every seat is great....why? Read on...,"We visited this historic venue for the first time a few months ago and WOW!! It was amazing. Every seat in the house is great. Yes if you can afford the up close seats, I'm sure the view is great but we were way in the back and we had a blast!! The fact that A) so many historic acts have performed there and B) with the big screens you have a good view anywhere throughout, --you really can't complain. PLUS you can bring in food and drinks!! Come on-where else in Los Angeles can you do that. My wife and I had wine and our daughters had snacks! We all loved it!",MrBalan
50,Best Large Outdoor Venue,"It's the Hollywood Bowl, what else can I say about it?! It's a great place to see a live concert. The sound is amazing at every seat in the house.Here is my advise on your visit.- Take the bowl shuttle from your closest location. The Hollywood Bowl area is too congested for everyone to drive in. Trying to drive out of the venue after the show is a nightmare.- Bring a picnic with you. Come early and hang out.- Prices at the Bowl are Hollywood prices. Be prepared to pay.- Buy whatever you want before you go to your seats. Mid-show the lines are crazy!!!- Have fun!",Vince A
50,Seeing the Stars Under the Stars,The Hollywood Bowl is a major attraction for Angelenos and tourists from around the world. During the warmer months it has performances ranging from jazz to music by ABBA to folk and etc. It is a happening where you can picnic at your seats by bringing food or purchasing it there. Commuting and parking can be a bear but they offer pick-up points for an extra charge that can transport you by bus from distant points to the Bowl and back. This is an outdoor facility and is really great on summer nights.,Barry D
10,It was shut!!!,"Travelled all the way from UK and a highlight was to see the Hollywood Bowl. Despite all the indications to the contrary on the website, when we got there it was shut.

50,Best concert venue ever,"Lucky enough to catch Duran Duran, Chic & Clean Bandit at the bowl with friends. We opted for a garden box which was a great idea. We brought our own food and ate just before the concert started. There are 2 fold away tables and 4 (comfy) folding chairs in your own little cordoned off area. Guy would come round and take drink orders and bring back to the table. Not a cheap option but so worth it to not have to stand in the ridiculously long lines. I understand that you can take in your own alcohol at some events so check before you go. Got a shuttle bus for $5 to the bowl then caught an Uber back home as I believe parking is a major issue. Amazing Surroundings, brilliant acoustics and best of all....no rain!",JillyDundee

50,The lowdown on rules: Is there a bad seat? Van Halen,"Back at the Bowl. This is why LA still has a presence in music. The seating arrangement is open and reminiscent of the 60's and 70's era. Plenty of access to the beer/wine venues. You can bring a cooler but no cans, plastic only so fill up on lemonade and vodka. No umbrellas. Take the local shuttles if you are local. $7.

Lovely relaxed atmosphere with everyone picnicking on benches, at tables and in their seats; from their own baskets, take out or from the concessions.

Gift shop was great, friendly staff!",Larry J
50,Great Evening,We went to see ABBA in Concert. Our first visit to the Bowl. Seems like all seats offer good views of the stage. 4 video screens helped our view. Sound system was top notch. The draw back is the long walk up the hill if you have seats in the back. There are escalators to help those with walking issues. Parking is available on site for $30 on our visit. You do have to park in a stacked fashion waiting for those ahead of you to move their cars first. We parked near the Chinese theater shopping area in a public underground garage and paid $15.,closch7
50,Summer concerts are the best,"It doesn't get any better than sitting outdoors with your own wine and snacks while watching an amazing performer. All types of shows happen here (rock, classical, musicals, etc.) but each one is always great. Easy to get here by public transportation which is highly encouraged. But there are pricey lots that you can sit through traffic and pay for. The bowl has many areas you can have a pinic at before enjoying the show. Must experience for concert go-ers.",Linh T
40,Great Night Concert,i visited to watch John Williams conduct some of his musical scores. The acoustics are great. A draw back is some of the seating is wooden benches and so pending the size of your neighbors it maybe hard to fit in.,lemountg

Bring some picnic or purchase one of those picnic packages they offer if you try to be fancy. Otherwise, a cheap $15 bottle of wine, a few cheese wedges, grapes, crackers and meats would do the trick. Most of the place is bench seating unless you're willing to shell out $100+ per seats. I've been to almost all of them; from boxed seats to the one all the way in the back. It just depends on the size of your crowd and your pocket; you can have a big picnic party, a nice date night with your husband, or a fancy dinner with colleagues.Parking always sucks here; but we always try to get here early and park at lot C; and walk under the bridge. They offer ride share buses, but I would recommend staying the night at one of the reasonable hotels within the 5 mile radius, uber it; and call it a day.Also, you can check out the local restaurants nearby. Mel's Diner is our go-to.",Ligaya72
50,Unbeatable experience!,There is so much I loved:- the relaxed feel of the place- the fact that you can take a picnic to eat inside or outside- the fact that there are seated areas to sit with friends at a table to easy in The Bowl- the seating was wooden bench seats instead of individual places seats- you can hire comfort cushions for $1- the trees which line The Bowl and make it feel enclosed and private- the sound quality was phenomenal- no heavy security or Police presence- the big screens were clear and brought the performance closer- parking was easy and close- there were plenty of bathrooms available during intermissionI don't love:- the fact that I live too far away to go regularly:(- people who 'shush' other patrons for talking during the performance (we didn't hear the other patrons talking and the people doing the ' shushing' and carrying on made way more noise in my opinion!,Safarinjema2014
50,Landmark,Absolutely the landmark in Hollywood!!The live show/concerts are the best~Perfect place to have a picnic before the show and have a fabulous time with family & friends.,ILoveFoodComa
50,HB Museum Tips!,"Above all, consult their website. The exhibits at this free museum change regularly, depending on the current season and the history of the bowl's past appearances. Several exhibits each time, a good review of the bowl's importance to LA since 1928. enjoy! If you are combining this visit with a concert here, make sure you allow enough time for a visit to the museum and then transit to your seats before the music begins. Use a park and ride option if at all possible. Enjoy!",etweeden
40,If you haven't been to the Bowl you haven't been to SoCal.,If I may offer - I've been attending events and concerts at the Bowl for 4+ decades. In this time I've had seats in the last row furthest back (that was a hoot!) and I've had box seats inside the pool circle. Alas most of the time I sit in the lower half of the sections directly behind the terrace box seats.As such - I recommend you go if you can - bring a picnic to enjoy before the show - or dine near by and get there a bit early. Parking can be quite difficult and perhaps it may seem expensive ($18+) but it is your best option. Handicap or disabled patrons can ask the parking attendant where to go for easier parking in their lot plus how to hop a shuttle just for those patrons needing assistance. I recommend the ODIN lot if you need assistance.If you don't need assistance - then you might want to consider the free parking in a PARK N RIde lot. You just need to purchase a park and ride bus ticket. The cost is a push for 4 - but cheaper for a couple.Otherwise - in the summer the Jazz on Wednesdays is iconic... and the classical tues/thurs serene. Going on the weekends can be tough and crowded... so I actually have not gone on a weekend in a long long time! This makes getting in and out much more comfortable.So go and enjoy!,Tom G
40,WE DID IT OUR WAY!,"The Bowl is a wonderful venue. Our group of four splurged on tickets in a centrally located box for the tribute to Frank Sinatra. Before the show we dined on a selection of wine and small plates in the Wine Bar Cafe located on the hillside above the main entrance. The food and the service were good. A clear night, great weather and music under the stars! WE DID IT OUR WAY!",PJeanneWashington_DC
50,Raindrops on roses and Hollywood picnics. These are some of my favorite things...,"The Hollywood Bowl is my absolute favorite thing about LA.I have been a member for several years now, and it is always worth the expense.There are some things I want every visitor to know about the Bowl. First and foremost, for events hosted by the LA Philharmonic as part of the Hollywood Bowl season, audience members are welcome to bring a picnic with them, including alcoholic beverages. You can even bring in your own corkscrew. However, you cannot BYOB for lease events (usually presented by Hewitt and Silva) for insurance reasons. Food is still okay, though.Secondly, parking at the Bowl is a nightmare. Please take one of the park & ride shuttles if you are traveling from the suburbs. Visit their website for shuttle locations and schedules.Lastly, please be punctual. These performances start and conclude fairly early (compared to other live music venues). Tardy patrons disturb both performers and audience members.PS, even in the summer, you may want to bring a light sweater because it can get chilly up there after the sun goes down.",GumdropGirl
50,"A Summer ""must do"" activity","We try and get down south at least once per summer to attend a concert at this venue. It is absolutely lovely. The people are always friendly, everyone is in a great mood and why not? Music, wine, a beautiful setting, what more can you ask for? This last concert this summer we were treated with a full moon!",Lovetoexplore16

She is very knowledgeable about the history of Hollywood Bowl. We have a really great time during the tour.If you are there for the concert, stop by the museum and check it out before the show.Did I mention it is ""FREE""?? :D",ILoveFoodComa
40,Great… with the Right Expectations,"So if you're anywhere beyond the first couple of sections, you're going to be hearing pumped-in sound. And the orchestra is often under-rehearsed—except for the film-music concerts, which have always been spot-on in my experience (I'm a professional composer).But as an experience the Bowl is consistently outstanding. Take the bus, take some food and a bottle of wine (or two!) and arrive a little early. It feels absolutely luxurious, like something that's nearly too good for us to have in the city.-1 for the occasional poor performance, but still a mandatory LA experience. Highly recommended.",SandersMusic
50,2015 Concert at the Hollywood Bowl,I went to go see a very good Concert and had the time of my life and the friends I went to party with and their friends and we had a great time.,Casper562
50,Best Summer Activity,"We go to the bowl at least a couple times every summer. We never miss Pink Martini here and it is always great. You can catch a shuttle bus or take the subway and a short walk, but don't drive as parking is expensive and hard to find. We always take a picnic lunch or dinner and a few bottles of wine. There are tons of places to sit and eat outside and inside. We usually get there a couple hours before the show and have a leisurely meal before going in. The bowl is always great and I have never had a bad experience there.Buy the cheap seats as they are, in my opinion, just as fun as the really expensive ones. No matter where you sit you will enjoy yourself and have a lot of fun. Pack a picnic, grab some wine, buy the cheap seats, arrive a couple hours early and enjoy the night. ALWAYS ALWAYS GREAT!",dbartoletti
50,Great Concert Venue,Hollywood Bowl is a landmark and to experience concerts here is a great experience. The acoustics are great and the big screens are very visual. If you end up on the benches make sure you bring bench cushions to sit on. The boxes are very cozy and make you feel like you're part of the VIP crowd. The venue grounds are very hilly so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. If you are out there on a hot day the sun does shift and you could be cool within hours. Comfortable venue but you are outside in the element.,Jeane141
50,Incredible venue for music--find something you like from the great line up of shows and go,"I have seen classical and rock concerts here--just went to see Diana Krall with the LA Philharmonic and a month ago saw Steely Dan. The summer evenings in LA are great and seeing a show at the bowl is one of the great LA experiences. It is a beautiful place, and acoustics are excellent. I highly recommend paying up for good seats--garden section is wonderful and get dinner catered to the box before the show starts. UBER is a great option since parking can be crowded...getting out can take 1/2 hour if you get blocked in. Go--you won't regret it. It is always a very special evening.",TheKoonah
50,What a fabulous venue,"Ziggy Marley and others were wonderful. I love the relaxing atmosphere of the Hollywood Bowl. Park and ride the buses, bring a picnic basket and some wine. We've been here a number of times while visiting the Los Angeles area.",Mn2Mx
50,Amaze Bowls!,"We were only in the area for one night, so booked tickets for the Jazz concert that night. We'd never heard of Dave Koz, but he and the support acts (including Macy Gray) were very entertaining, but the real star of the show is the Bowl itself. I've never been anywhere like it and the sound was awesome.As much as I enjoyed the concert and the atmosphere (we were almost right at the back where the social element was in full flow, an experience in itself), I'd love to visit again and hear an orchestra play.Whatever the music, if there's something on when you're nearby, grab some tickets if you can.We stayed at the Roosevelt, which is within walking distance (it took us about twenty minutes there up the hill and fifteen on the way back down).We loved our night out at the Hollywood Bowl!",MrHandBaggageOnly
50,Amongst the locals in an iconic venue,"I booked tickets through ticektmaster for a show prior to going to LA, and cannot recommend this highly enough (though print your tickets before you go as Ticketmaster have a very irritating voice-activated system which is not ideal if you are not US). It was amazing to listen to great music under the stars on a balmy LA evening. Lots of opportunities to buy food and drink, and not too badly priced. Most Los Angelenos had pcaked picnics though. Next time!",sbizzle
50,First time at the Hollywood Bowl and am now a great fan,"We were invited by another couple to join them for a Diana Krall concert at the Hollywood Bowl last night. Never having been there before, I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was we had box seats that were in a good location. This was a total understatement. The box was back just far enough to provide a great view of the entire stage and almost at eye-level with the stage. Closer and we would have had a narrower view of the performance and would have had to look up the entire time. A picnic dinner before the performance, excellent weather, and great company made this an outstanding evening. I will definitely be looking forward to another visit to this awesome venue.",Bill G
50,A Little Night Music,"Love music? Then you should experience a night at the Bowl. Whether you are into Classical, Jazz, Show Tunes or Popular, you can find it here. The outdoor venue encourages, picnics, allows alcohol and the acoustics are perfect. What a way to enjoy summer!",Paula B
50,Dream come true!,"I've dreamed of seeing a concert at the Hollywood Bowl since I was a child; such an iconic venue!We finally got to go in August 2015 and it happened to be a Bugs Bunny at the Symphony concert the night we went. So much fun!We were staying at a hotel within walking distance, which was brilliant because the parking looked horrendous!Coming from England, I was amazed at how cheap the programme was ($1)!! We liked the wide choice of wines and that you could take a bottle in to drink during the concert.Our seats were in section M1, right in the middle but not too expensive. We had a great view and could see the detail on the screens. The sound was fine.Loved the whole experience! It's a BEAUTIFUL venue. If you're sitting on the benches, you should definitely hire cushions. They raise you up a bit for an even better view!The merchandise shop was great too. Huge variety of souvenirs.Leaving at the end took a while (obviously) and I felt really sorry for the people stacked in the car park. If you can find a way to park a ten minute walk away, do it! There is a large church near Hollywood & Highland that were advertising parking and all proceeds go to the church if you want to help a good cause while enjoying an amazing concert in a fabulous location!",LAJAMoo
40,Can’t beat a night under the stars with music; if only they could improve the parking.,"I have done the Bowl in boxes, with great food and wines, and in the bleachers (also with great food and wines); classical, rock concerts and jazz. Although I prefer the better seats for the shows that are more my musical taste, all are amazing, and you can't beat a night at the Bowl.I hate the parking, especially having to wait for cars in front of you, before you can leave, but have never been able to convince my husband or others I go with to take the public transportation. To pay $20 for that parking lot is highway robbery.",Sherry S
30,"Museum is not much, but the Hollywood Bowl itself is a must-see!","Since this review category seems to allow only for the Hollywood Bowl's museum, I'll start with that. The museum itself is really not much, but certainly worth a visit if you're going to the Hollywood Bowl for a concert, anyway. It's small and not exactly comprehensive, but it does give you a history of this historic concert venue.That being said, I would strongly recommend for any tourist visiting Los Angeles during the Hollywood Bowl's season (dates vary each year, check its website ahead of time for specific shows/dates during your visit) get tickets to a concert at this iconic amphitheater. Each season, the Hollywood Bowl offers a wide variety of shows, including individual concerts by top recording/touring artists, L.A. Philharmonic concerts (often with celebrity guest artists), abbreviated versions of popular Broadway musicals, and shows with video components on the huge wide screens placed strategically around the stage area. At select concert/shows, there is also a great fireworks display above the Bowl itself.The outdoor seating is pretty rustic & basic (the more affordable areas are nothing more than hard wooden bleacher-type bench seating), but the sound quality is almost always amazing.Snacking & picnicking at your seats is not only allowed, it's encouraged--so pack your favorite food or buy some at the concession stands there.IMPORTANT TIP: The parking situation surrounding the Hollywood Bowl is frustrating & laborious, so take advantage of the ""Park & Ride"" lots near the Bowl to save yourself a lot of grief!",Evan B
40,Great Venue/Horrible Parking,"Nothing better than a favorite performer at the Bowl. Outdoors, under the stars, add a picnic dinner and something to drink and you're having too much fun.However, where do you park? The stacked parking at the Bowl itself can trap you for a long time. Avoid it at all costs. The subway is a bit of a walk, but worth considering. I suggest one of the shuttle buses available at different locations.",TravelinAlan
50,Outstanding venue for concerts,"This was our second visit to the Hollywood Bowl, and we enjoyed it just as much. The sound quality is excellent, and there are large screens so you can see the performers on stage 'up close'. Plenty of places to grab a bite to eat, and some more formal place to sit and dine. Picnicking is big here, and they provide plenty of places for it, including some areas of the bowl seating with fold up tables. Wine - by the glass or bottle - and beer is available. We're looking at the line up for future shows. A word about parking: It's stacked so you can't leave until the cars in front of you do. We stayed overnight and walked to the Bowl so it was easy; there is also public transportation available.",BlondieOriginal2014

I wish I had planned better in the picnic category. EVERYONE does it, it's like a science out there. Coming from Boston we obviously couldn't bring a basket and food, but we did manage to pick up reasonably good fixing at a nearby speciality supermarket: sandwiches, chips and dip, wine and glasses. I'd definitely return to Hollywood Bowl for a show, just plan where I get my food better!!",amybatt

50,Went to a concert,we decided to finish the holiday with a concert at the bowl and it was a good d decision. We went to see Josua Bell and the LA Phil. What I didn't realise is that the area we were sitting in was all set up for picnics. Most of the locals were bringing in their hampers and settling down on the canvass chairs to eat and drink. Then when the concert starts the tables are removed the chairs turned around and you listen to the performance. For out of owners I believe you can buy preprepared picnics. We stopped at the wine bar which was also a good choice. The performance was great. Altogether a great evening to cap off our 3 weeks of touring,hartlovap

50,Fabulous evening at the Bowl!,"Traffic coming and going is a mess, take one of the Bowl shuttles. Get there at least an hour before the show. Bring a picnic, something easy....sandwiches, chips, fruit, and of course wine! You might not find a picnic table, but you can eat in your seats. If you can, go directly to the Bowl to purchase your tickets...well worth it. We did, and bought good seats for $34 each...Ticketmaster quoted U.S. $64 plus an additional PER TICKET charge, I think $8.50! We got better seats for less.We went last night to the Bugs Bunny Symphony with cousins visiting from Quebec. Last year they were here and we took them to the Bowl to see the Alfred Hitchcock symphony....they loved it, and it's the first thing they asked us to arrange. Last night was fabulous, the screens projected the WB Cartoons as the orchestra played in synch...so wonderful. And as if that wasn't wonderful enough, a ""prima ballerina"" from the Ballet Trocadero made an appearance and did a great ""swan death dance"". On toe! I have always wanted to see the Ballett Trocadero, so it threw me over the edge...so great. A wonderful evening, it's always fun to go to the Bowl, get some tickets, pack a picnic and go!",stanom

40,Small but Interesting and Free,"The Museum is near the entrance of the Hollywood Bowl. If you're going to an event at the Bowl, this is worth a visit. You can see everything in about 30 mins or less depending on your level of interest.The permanent exhibit provides a lot of history of the Bowl and has photos and small replicas of the various evolution of the Bowl. The structure's architecture changed over the years. There are also highlights of major events and memorabilia from the Beatles and other performances who have played at the Bowl. About half the museum can be special exhibits, usually around a key concert performance for the season. I enjoyed seeing a bit of history about the bowl.If you're a tourist and looking to visit the museum as a standalone venue, there are likely other more interesting ones.",LuvtoSafari
30,More Than A Museum- It's An Icon,"Somehow the museum has overshadowed the actual Bowl in this listing.I believe the Bowl dates back to the 1920's and originally served as the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Today during the summer season, the Bowl hosts classical performances on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Wednesdays are dedicated to jazz, Fridays and Saturdays are a potpourri of musical performances and Sundays are host to special performances.There are two ways to look at the Bowl. The romantic view offers a list of performances under stars in a tranquil setting nestled in the Hollywood Hills.The practical approach is the acoustics are marginal. The crowd does not always focus on the performance and gets caught up talking to their neighbor, opening their cell phones for pictures or worse texting, or succumbing to other distractions.Seating on the bench seats can sometimes be challenging. Although seat numbers are marked on the back of the bench, some individuals have difficulty fitting in the provided space, thus some individuals can become very squeezed or end up in an uncomfortable position.Many bring a picnic meal to enjoy prior to the performance. There are several types of food for purchase from simple items to more complex meals. Spirits are also available for purchase, but you are generally allowed to bring your own. Usually there are individuals that will have a corkscrew available if you happen to forget yours.If personal comfort is a priority look into Super Seats. They are in the center of the theatre, slightly more expensive, but they are theatre seats with a bit more leg room than the benches.Parking presents the biggest challenge. Except for the expensive valet lots, all parking is stacked parking and approaches $20 per vehicle. (Forget about leaving early or even shortly after the conclusion of the performance.)There is bus service available from outlying areas and for about $7.00 it is a great way to deal with the transportation issue.",LifesaSnap
50,Amazing place and concert,"We visited this place for a concert with Gustavo Dudamel, celebrating his 10 anniversary with the L.A. philharmonic. It was an amazing experience. The bowl has great acoustics and the prices are really affordable. The picnic area is a great idea for having dinner before the concert. This is definitively one of my new favorite spots.P.S. If you park at the parking lot of the bowl be patient, as the cars are arranged one behind the another and you have to wait for the owner so you can get out. This can be a tiring process, so bring an Audiobook or something.",Mariano Tello N

40,Hollywood Bowl Staff,"I went to the JOHN Fogerty Concert in July 2015. This was my first visit to The Hollywood Bowl. We took the Park and Ride which was well worth the money. The directions to reach the Park and Ride were not thorough and it was not at the bus bay that was listed and we almost missed the bus. The park and Ride staff going to and from were great. When we got to the Hollywood Bowl, a staff member from The Hollywood Bowl got on the bus and very quickly began giving us directions of how to find the bus after the show . Some senior citizens at the back of the bus asked him to repeat the info because it was difficult to hear. They were promptly yelled at by this fellow and all directions stopped. I was shocked that this horrible treatment of customers would be allowed at such a prestigious venue. The Hollywood Bowl is breathtaking. The poor customer service however seemed to be the norm. Ushers were stuffy and rude as were many of the concession staff for the most part. The concert and sound were awe inspiring. So Hollywood Bowl, PLEASE give your staff some sensitivity or customer service training. This is far too outstanding a venue to be ruined by rude staff. Thank You!",Cindy A

We were cold as didn't bring jackets on our LA trip. Was expecting hot July temperatures. LA didn't prove to be hot for us. The fireworks were amazing.

The icononic theater that has hosted The Beatles and Beethoven is great for any show. Artists come and go. Some good, some not so good, but to spend a warm summer evening under the stars, with a picnic dinner, a little vino and some good friends, you could listen to paint dry and still enjoy it. Don't stress over the parking or how long it takes to leave. It's all part of the experience. Take your time. Relax. Enjoy. Oh, and bring a sweater or a blanket. Even in August, the evenings get a little chilly.",jtlerman

50,Amphitheater review,"We went to the Harry Connick Jr concert. It was a fantastic night all around.The venue is brilliant, beautiful under the starts, new modern yet a classic feeling too.The theater is very well staffed and the night I was there they moved nearly 15K people very efficiently in and out afterwards. We had nose bleed seats for $50 / each, but... because that bench was over-filled the staff moved us way way down within 15 feet of the stage! They moved a few other groups for similar reasons...So we had close up views of Harry, better seats, and we so, so surprised and happy.We had brought throw pillows to sit on the benches, but did not need them in the new, better chairs! We did bring a small blanket which was nice, but in July it was only a tiny bit cool.Now the really good stuff... we loved Harry Connick Jr.. his show was beautiful, fun, energized, and fantastic. He put the audience in such a great mood, he did some of every style he is known for -- including torch songs, jazz, New Orleans. He told funny quick stories , and sang for two hours! Harry was wonderful, and my 24 year old daughter said... "" OMG his voice is fantastic, he has a sweet smile and he's a babe."" She knew of him, but was surprised he was so handsome... and she loved the music... I'd love to see Harry again.... you really could not ask for more in a live show! His personality comes through, he's funny, loves his music and is so kind to his musicians, and you can tell he loves the experience with the crowd.Few points... we took a park and ride and that was great too... made it easy to walk right into the Bowl.Food was expensive... but actually good. You can bring in anything you want to bring in... food, snacks, wine, drinks, etc. We'd do that next time.We got there in time but stopped to eat and got into the venture just after the National Anthem... There is no seating except when a break in the singung... we were lucky we got in just before Harry started singing -- or you have to wait for a break in the music.... However , our slight delay allowed the nose blead bench seats to fill up... and we got better seats... amazing seats.....Bench seats can get hard over 2.5 hours, get a $1 cushion or bring some; your own food, a throw blanket.... that's it....oh when Harry jokes at the last 15 mins, that there are empty seats up front, so come on up... don't a young couple tried but were turned away... (they stayed and sat in our little area which also had a lot of empty seats 15 feet from the stage.There is an escalator up, but you walk a bit down... may take 10-20 minutes depending on crowd. It's easy walk down. If you need help, contact the venue before time.Over all this was a great experience. Great for couples, family , nearly every age over say 5 or 6, and a fun night I highly recommend. Not cheap -- but so worth it!","Robin (So far 45,000 readers!)"
50,Cool even when empty!,"Love the Hollywood Bowl - and it's cool to visit even when it is empty. Check the website and schedule to see if the LA Phil is rehearsing on weekday mornings.

50,Great venue!,"I had not been here in years and WOW how things have changed.How can you not love BYO everything! We had a picnic before our concert and absolutely loved it. We brought drinks, food, snacks and it was a piece of cake bringing it all in. It also feels safe there I didn't see any crazy drunks at all.If you don't want to worry about parking I would suggest getting an uber. That made our experience so much better! Dealing with parking at the bowl can be frustrating and not only that but super expensive.",dianam1184
50,Superb staff!,"We were visiting from the Isle of Man and stopped by the Hollywood Bowl for a look on the way into the city. We noticed that Ed Sheeran was playing that night and although the show was sold out we decided to enquire at the desk if there was a chance of getting any resale seats. The staff advised that if we were to come back later in the afternoon there would be a chance some tickets would become avaliable. End result - 3 tickets at face value in a box right in front of the stage!! Amazing experience but the thought we all came away with most was how awesome all the staff at the venue were - in particular the ticketing staff who were so friendly and helpful, providing information on the venue, ticketing process and the various ways of getting to and from the Bowl. Thank you so much for making our vacation!",Laura M
40,Great Venue! Saw Smokey Robinson perform,"The setting is wonderful at the Hollywood Bowl. We got to see Smoky Robinson perform. The show was great. Parking and traffic were a problem though. Luckily we had parked about five miles away and we biked there. When we exited the Bowl, we left the traffic behind and we were gone. Bring your own food, they encourage it. Good time all the way around.",ZumaDawg
50,Mariachi USA Festival,Always a fantastic time at the bowl. We took our own picnic and enjoyed it under the stars. We always take the shuttle from the Ventura Blvd lot near Universal Studios. Only $6 round trip per person. Take the shuttle and avoid the gridlock!,Martha A
50,Memorable evening at the Hollywood Bowl!,"We went to see Andrea Bocelli in concert. It was our first time at the Hollywood Bowl! It was an unforgettable evening! The sound, the view of the Hollywood Hills all added up to a wonderful experience.I hope to go back again.",ladydi50CA

Take a bottle of wine, some cheese and fruit and settle in for a wonderful experience.",Snobuz78
50,Amazing,"I attended the ""We Can Survivor"" concert in October and I was absolutely blown away. Although our seats were far back, we could still hear everything as if we were in front row. There was an incredible view of the Hollywood Hills above the stage. It wasn't even too crowded when we got out of the concert, as the paths were very wide so everyone wasn't bumping into each other. Beer was extremely pricey but not surprising for a venue located right in Hollywood. I can't wait to visit again!",Taylor R
50,Great Venue,"What a great venue under the stars to see hit performers make their mark. We found a great deal on box seats upfront doing a little online searching in advance and it was well worth the effort. You can eat at picnic tables across the street, purchase food inside the venue or preorder food and have it delivered to your seat depending where you are sitting. Picnic baskets are allowed with restrictions - read ahead of time. Make sure to arrive early for good parking spaces. It is usually worth the while to pay for ahead. One of my favorite places to visit in LA.",Stmartin1
40,Plenty pics,"The stadium was closed so we drove straight to the top. What a view of the city. Plenty of photo opportunities, who would've known. Worth a visit.",sammied3000
50,Amazing even if there's no concert,"While on a tour of L.A., we ended up here as one of the stops. We had driven past it a few times but never thought about touring it. We ended up really impressed by the Hollywood Bowl! We were there during the day when nothing was going on. We were able to walk up into the different levels of box seating. Even without a concert going on, we could tell how amazing the experience would be. So if you're planning a tour and you see the Hollywood Bowl as a stop, look forward to it! And by all means if you have the opportunity to go to a concert there, GO!",TNHarleyChick
40,How to see an orchestra performance FREE!,"It is a little-known fact that on nights when the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra performs, you can always catch their daytime rehearsals that same day for FREE!Yup, even the parking is free. Just drive right in, and you can practically park behind the bandshell.Practices/performances are usually Tuesdays, Thursdays, and occasional Fridays. You can call the box office the day before to find out the exact rehearsal time, but it usually starts somewhere between 9:30am-10:30am.Go inside, and spread out, and sit anywhere. Other people are there...enjoying breakfast, reading sheet music, giving their kids simple exposure to culture. Great, too, for that out-of-town visitor.",Kenneth O
40,The impossible dream,"The best way to enjoy the Bowl is from the box seats up front, which have fold down tables for dining. Virtually impossible to obtain. Never fear. There are picnic tables outside the Bowl!",CarmichaelVentura
50,Hollywood Bowl summer,I just renewed my Classical Tuesday series for summer of 2015. I am already excited. I loved the past summers with the LA Phil. I go to some of the other genres as well. It is always such a great night out! Everyone seems to enjoy it!The season goes from June through September!,LauraJean S
50,The best Hollywood experience of them all,"If you’ve never been to the Bowl and are visiting Los Angeles, don’t get picky about which show is on: JUST MAKE SURE YOU GO. Tickets can be bought online for as low as $15. Arrive in time, bring your own food and wine (or buy there on the spot), have a picnic, go to one of the restaurants or eat and drink in your seat during the show: anything goes. Even if you get the cheapest tickets way up in the back rows, four big screens, spectacular sound and lights guarantee you a great experience.If going by car, please bear in mind that parking space at the Bowl is very limited. It’s strongly advisable to use the Bowl shuttle bus service: park (for free) at one of the designated areas, get on the bus ($5 return ticket) and enjoy the ride all the way to the Bowl. After the show, buses will take you back to your parking space.Highly recommended!",Kristian Bengtson
40,good history of the bowl,This was a fun museum next to the Hollywood Bowl. Along with the photos of bowl history there were videos with music played thru earphones. Quite a pleasant surprise.,Fred J
40,Great venue for concerts,"Historic concert venue. Benches were uncomfortable so we had more reason to be out of the seats. There was no echo despite the huge outdoor theater, thoroughly enjoyed my experience here!",deszpicable
50,The weeknd King of the fall tour,"I was wondering what our first experience at the hollywood bowl would be like, and it didn't disappoint. Not to mention we stayed close enough to walk, by passing the headache of trying to park. I actually felt sorry for the ppl that would have to wait for hours just to start to get out of the lot. The venue is very nice and clean. We sat in the garden box terrace, closer to the stage. They have waiters with bottle service and taking food orders. The acoustics at the bowl are AMAZING. There system is on point and. The weeknd killed it as expected. Hands down the best concert we have attended.",Stewarts3125
50,Great Concert Place,"I went here for the first time to see the concert for We Will Survive (for cancer). We didn't have the greatest seats, but there are big screens so you can see the performers. Being outside in the mountains was so cool, just below the Hollywood sign! The music projected well & sounded really good. Plenty of concession stands, mostly items you would find at a movie theater. I would love to go here for a concert again.",A_Rick1
40,Fun to go at any time,"The Hollywood Bowl is one of my favorite places to go to concerts. It's a terrific venue to go to with family and friends, have a picnic and enjoy a lovely musical event. The acoustics are so much better than they have ever been making it even more enjoyable.",JSW842
50,One off the Bucket List!,"I planned a trip to Southern and Central California around the Luke Bryan Concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I have always heard how amazing this concert venue is, so it was the perfect opportunity to finally see it first hand. The Bowl is a beautiful venue! I wish our seats would have been closer to the stage, but the screens throughout the venue still made the concert amazing. Luke is always so much fun in person. Since I traveled out of state I booked a hotel room at the Lowe's on Highland and it was great location. We could walk to and from the Bowl and miss the whole hassle of parking. Parking at the Bowl looked like a mess. So, if you can avoid that I would do it! I hope I can go back someday for another concert.",Yougotmeatvacation
40,Great venue,"For such a large space I was expecting getting to and from our seats to be a nightmare but it all went surprisingly smoothly with no bad bottlenecks. I'd really suggest not parking at the bowl as you'll wait a long time to get out again-we walked. Also maybe bring food and drink with you as queues at the bars were very long.The sound for the support band was a little lacklustre but Kings of Leon sounded amazing. The video screens were great, enhanced the performance rather than overshadowing the stage. Really enjoyed the concert.",Nell100
40,Great concert,"Went to Luke Bryan concert, place is huge and has multiple Tv screens to look at and sound is amazing. Major downside is the parking as it is stack so you can be there for awhile, would recommend staying at a nearby hotel as it is well worth the money. Best Western, Hilton Garden Inn, Holiday Inn Express and the BLVD Hotel all within walking distance.",Ols714
50,Amazing experience!,"This facility is breathtakingly beautiful. The staff had the process of running a sold out concert there running like a well-oiled machine. There was no chaos or confusion. The campus was gorgeous, the acoustics were amazing, and the food was delicious.",Sandi W
50,Luke Bryan rocked the Bowl!!,"I've been here for a Coldplay concert and a Luke Bryan concert! They were both amazing and this venue is perfect. You will be cozy and packed in but it is such a great venue.Also, be prepared for stacked parking and no early exit, but if you come prepared with food and drinks, there is no reason to rush.We waited in Lot B after the concert and ate at the picnic table with no rush to get in traffic.Hope to get back here for another event soon!",Urbanhick
50,Small very interesting museum,Loved this museum. Interesting yo see performers of by gone times who have performed at the Bowl. Other interesting facts too.,PaulineRobinsonArt
50,Amazing just to walk around it,You can visit this during the daytime when there is nobody else there. There is a small museum giving details of performers from years gone by. You can walk all around the seating areas and at the top get a breath taking view of the Hollywood Hills,PaulineRobinsonArt
50,Amazing venue,"This was a highlight when I visited LA. I saw two concerts here: the 20th Anniversary of Dreamworks and Motley Crue’s farewell tour. The venue is amazing. It holds almost 18,000 people but the sound is fantastic which can often be a let-down to huge venues. It’s an outdoor venue and the seats are tiered- they’re wooden and you can hire a cushion for $1, or bring something yourself to pad it. I was around the middle for both concerts, but even the back seemed like they’d have a great view. The price of tickets vary according to section, so you don’t have to spend much to go to a concert (starting around $20 and then upwards to over $1,000 for Motley Crue’s VIP seats) You can make an afternoon of this. The venue opens hours before the show so you can have a picnic outside – either bring your own or buy food here. You can even take alcohol inside if you wanted, although not for ‘lease’ events like Motley Crue. There’s a free museum telling you about the history of the bowl with audio from old concerts. In the summer the weather is hot but it does cool down in the evenings so you should bring a jacket for later on. There were no problems taking photos or video at either of these events and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. If you visit Mullholland Drive to view the Hollywood sign you have a great view of the bowl looking down. You can park at the bowl but it gets congested and full early. A shuttle bus both ways is offered from various places – I got on it beside the Dolby Theatre on the Hollywood Boulevard. It’s free if you have a TAP card (transport pass) and $5 otherwise. If you have a free evening then go a concert here, it’s a fantastic experience that you’re not likely to forget.",Kim H
50,Ginormous venue with great acoustics,"We went to see Trey Anastasio and the LA Philharmonic orchestra here. What a treat!!Venue is huge, plenty of staff to help guide you to your seats. If you aren't comfortable on hard seating then either hire a seat pad or being your own.Would definitely recommend the park and ride facility. While it seems another add-on to your ticket price it's well worth it. Parking charge at Hollywood bowl is $17 across the road, coach is only 7.95 each. Traffic crawls up the highway so much more convenient to be driven by coach. The coach service is very well organised, saves you money, petrol, time and is less stressful.",BubblyTripper
50,Events at the Hollywood Bowl are always enjoyable!,"This time around, we saw Steve Martin and his band perform - and it was fabulous! In addition to the great bands and special guests, there was a fireworks show that was spectacular.We enjoyed a catered meal during the performance, making it extra special.In the past, parking has been the one pain associated with coming here. Not anymore. We now utilize the park and ride available at the Los Angeles Zoo. They had free parking there for us, with frequent shuttle pick-ups. Leaving the Bowl for the Zoo was also a quick and easy experience.Two thumbs up for the Hollywood Bowl!",Reservation4Four
50,Iconic landmark,"Saw this place as part of an organised tour. Great to stand in the place where so many of the greats have performed, including my all-time favourites, The Beatles. Shame you can't go on stage, but I suppose I'll just have to practice harder to do that!",TOM-C--LIVERPOOL
50,Great venue if you sit close enough...,"It is a great venue under the stars, creating some of the most epic moments during concerts. I would recommend trying to purchase tickets in the mid level or closer, anything further back just isn't worth the money or the trip. At that point you're just watching the concert on tv. They don't serve liquor, only beer and wine. The wine comes in a tiny little shot glass and the white wine is served warm, so splurge and do the $11 beer. It is LA, so bring layers with you. You don't know if a 90 degree day will turn into a chilly evening once the sun disappears behind the hills.",Elizabeth K
50,Hollywood Bowl - the best venue in the world!!,"I was lucky enough to attend Barry Gibb's (of the Bee Gees) solo concert at the Hollywood Bowl in June 2014. The venue is amazing, an outside ampitheatre in the Hollywood hills - of course you are usually blessed with the Californian wonderful weather, and everyone took waterproof gear in case, but was not needed due to the lovely warm June evening. I had always wanted to go to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl as it has a fantastic atmosphere and a beautifully designed stage. The acoustics were perfect and I would recommend attending any concert there, but especially your favourite artist - as the combination, in my opinion, would be the best musical experience of your life. The facilities there were good too, and many members of the audience took their own picnic, which is allowed. I have been to many concerts, but Barry is the best - he was also humbled to be appearing at such an iconic venue. Go see for yourselves.",Helen P
20,Not a good concert venue,"Purchased tickets to see Kings of Leon when thy first went on sale but the closest seats we could get at that time were in section M3. Didn't think they would be bad because it was in the middle of the venue. On the day of the concert we parked at the LA Zoo lot. Took almost an hour to get to the Hollywood Bowl due to the shuttle driving through the Universal Studios main drive and there was a lot of traffic. The show had already started by the time we were dropped off. After walking up the hill to our seats, we, along with lots of other people, had a difficult time locating our seats. The walk ways are not lit, and the rows do not have easy to read marking (numbers are etched in not painted) so everyone is walking around shining their lights in order to find their rows. We even asked for help finding our seats and were just told ""it's over there."" After getting settled in, we realized how far away from the stage we were. The big screens were not on for the first 2 bands so all we could do was listen. If I wanted to do that, I would have just listened to the CD. The last band came on and the screens were turned on but the sound was terrible most of the show. Over all this show and venue were not worth the money I paid and will not see another show there. Might be good for orchestra's but not concerts unless you can afford to still really close.",tiggergurl
30,Chairs,"It would've been a great venue to see an orchestra at, but for The Pixies and Gogol Bordello, I would've wanted to jump around. Still a very nice place. Maybe too nice for a punk.",Aeric C
40,Must do in LA!,"I saw the last performance of Hair on a Sunday night, which was the day the we flew in. It was a great experience but we were exhausted! Check out the view - the Hollywood Sign is in the background. Here's a tip - sit as close as you can afford. We were sitting high up (waited too long to buy tickets plus we were already going over budget) and in the middle. We had trouble seeing the performers and by sitting in the middle, we couldn't see the screens that were showing the performance on either side of the stage. Also, bring your own food and drink. It's predictably expensive and most people bring their own picnic and wine. And fyi - the night that we went, it was rainy so people brought umbrellas, but the ticket takers wouldn't allow them to bring them in. They could apparently pick them up later but I just imagine there's a huge storeroom filled with umbrellas somewhere. Also, if you sit on benches, either bring cushions or rent them from the Bowl for $1.00 a piece. You can rent cushions on the path on the way to your seat. Last thing, DO NOT DRIVE HERE! Parking is atrocious. Buy tickets for the park and ride on their website and save yourself a headache.",kmr85
50,"Sound, like you've never heard","Breathtaking sound, otherworldly ambience, California style. First stepping into the near empty bowl is pretty arresting all on its own. It's a scooped out hollow surrounded by seat lined canyon walls. It's an enormous half burrow for people who love music. The seating, steep as it is affords even the nose bleeds a view of the performance. The boxes are dreamy. You're own sovereign domain, the likes of which I've never experienced in a venue.Early birds fill the bowl with picnics and anticipation. And for those of us who are anticipation addicts, we adore the wait, nibbling on your picnic and sipping a glass of champagne watching the people come is seriously gratifying.But the best bit. The sound coming off that stage. The sound- silky dark chocolate velvet, you could just drown in it.",anamshaz
50,Great outdoor experience,This is a wonderful venue to visit. They've really improved the sound over the years...it's always been a great night out.I played a gig here back in the '70s...and I'm still a big fan. Go on a night when they have fireworks!,Jack C
50,Wow,"The sound is incredible. I have no idea how they do it, but they do it right. Saw Trey Anastasio (Phish guitarist) play with the LA Phil and you could hear every single note that every single person played. Amazing. Very nice surrounding. Also, for LA Phil sponsored events you can bring in any food and bevs your little heart desires... Very nice touch.",CussV
50,John Williams concert,"We went to the Hollywood Bowl for the first time and saw composer John Williams and the LA philharmonic on Friday, August 28, 2014. The weather was warm and crystal clear. The venue is truly unique. We brought our own sandwiches. Some people has brought their own table clothes and candles. The concert itself in the Bowl was spectacular. Mr. Williams had no fewer than 3, maybe 4 encores. We used the cheap and easy shuttle bus services provided at various locations. Our left and returned to the Westwood area federal building. Parking was free and the bus service was $7.75 per person. We highly recommend everything.",ptcvineyard
40,"Atmospheric, even when no event on","We walked up to see teh Hollywood Bowl one morning as we have always been Rock fans, and the history of this place is amazing. To see the pictures of the Beatles playing there was brilliant. The museum is fascinating, and free!! Then you can walk around teh seating area completely freely, I guess if I had been a bit braver we could have got onto the stage! There was an Ed Sheeran concert due that night and the prep was all going on around us, but we still managed to walk to teh very back seats and look down on teh stage. It does make you wonder about security, but otherwise a place of dreams.",Pete R
40,Great outside venue.,"I went to the Hollywood bowl for the Beatles Tribute Concert that was commemorating the fist time that the Beatles played at the Hollywood Bowl.The concert itself was fun. Some singers sang out of tune, it was tacky, but I love the Beatles, so an evening listenning to their music, while outside, having a glass of wine, was good. I was high up, and had paid our tickets about 30 $ each, so I didn't feel like I wasted my money. I might have had a different opinion if I was sitting up front or if I had paid a lot of money for my tickets.I went for the experience, and I loved it! I had never been to an outside concert in such a setting. We took the shuttle provided by our hotel (magic castle hotel) to go and come back. Therefore, transport was very easy and we had no issues, except being stuck in masses of people slowly walking down towards the exits.We did arrive early with our lunches and wine. We sat on a bench near the entrance and had our appetizers there. It was full of people, all in a good mood. I was pleased to have partaken in the LA experience as a tourist. Then we went to our seat and finished our meal. It was neat to eat and drink while watching the concert. It should be allowed more often!I was sitting quite far (P section) but the sound was very good and they have giant screen that allows you to see well. But even from my seat, I could see the stage and performers as well as in any arena. I rented seat cushions for 1 $. I think that from all seat, you must hear well.They do sell souvenirs (blankets, t-shirts, cushions, glasses, etc.) but they take cash, so make sure that you bring some money with you and not only cards if you intend to purchase something. They also have good and drinks if you don't want to bother bringing a backpack.Overall, although the concert was not great, we had a great time and I would strongly recommend the Hollywood Bowl to tourists.",Isa b
40,My First Visit to the Hollywood Bowl,"My very first trip to the Hollywood Bowl on September 20th for the Sound of Music Sing Along!I had won my tickets from TCM and was very excited to go, we drove up from San Diego - traffic was a problem on the way there, but not on the way back. What a great venue! - the sound system was fantastic and there were so many people - they said about 16,000 for the event.I thought the staff was great and it was a lot of fun. One drawback and disappointment is that their bathrooms are unacceptably inadequate for the amount of people that they can pack into that place. Lines were extremely long and then you get to the ladies room and there are only 3 stalls!!! NOT GOOD. That was the CLOSE restroom, the one further away from the venue was up a very steep hill and the line was twice as long during intermission. So 4 stars just for that reason. If they improve the restrooms, they would get 5 from me!One tip - PACK A PICNIC SUPPER! The food choices are ok, but limited and of course costly as you would expect from a tourist venue. Parking was a bit strange, stacked , cost at $17 - $30 depending on how close you wanted to be and you have to wait for a bit when you leave, but if you go to the restrooms before you leave, as we did, the wait is done there and by the time you get done, you can easily exit parking.",SoCalMediaSurfer
30,Hollywood Bowl....Not a Great Concert....Has Issues.,"We were visiting some friends in Huntington Beach and they said that they had two extra tickets for a show at the Hollywood Bowl. I had been to the Hollywood Bowl many years ago for an Easter sunrise service and it was amazing. Sitting there in the dark and then the sun rose over the mountains and the birds started to sing. It was epic. However, the Hollywood Bowl proved to be both good and bad. We went to a Beatles Tribute Concert that was to commemorate the fist time that the Beatles played at the HB. Our friends said that they always bring a nice picnic lunch including wine, and eat on the grounds near the parking lot before every concert. That was actually the highlight of the evening. By the way, parking is stacked, which means that you basically wait for all of the cars in front of you to leave before you can leave. That wasn't too great when you are tired and want to go home. Anyway, there is a steep hill that you have to walk up to get to the bowl. It would be very tough to walk up the hill if you were older of had any sort of physical limitations. We finally got to our seats. Our friends suggested that we rent cushions because the Hollywood Bowl has bleacher type seating. I highly recommend bringing your own cushion because they were sold out and the wood slat benches become extremely uncomfortable after a short time. So, the concert was horrible. The performers had not rehearsed together, didn't even know the right lyrics and totally disregarded all of the nuances of the Beatles songs. I could hardly wait for the concert to end. The tickets were $60.00 a piece. The only good thing about the concert was sitting in the bowl, looking at the scenery and seeing images of the Beatles displayed on the front of the stage. So, if you are going to a concert I would take all of these ""problems"" into consideration.",Travelgal4444
50,Simpsons 25th,We visited last weekend for the first time. There are several parking lots but it's easier to park in the lot across the street. We surprisingly got out of there pretty quickly. There are hills but there's also an elevator and escalator. The food is very expensive but they allow you to bring in your own. It was 100 degrees and I had to buy a soda because of the heat. One soda was $5!! We only paid $13 for our seats and we were able to see just fine. There are large screens and we even got to see a fireworks show. We had a great time!!,Gina K

50,Great Summer Night Experience!,"My wife and I had the opportunity to see a John Williams show featuring the LA Philharmonic and Seth Macfarlane. We had such an amazing experience. From the amped sell out crowd of fellow geeky fans looking to see the master of movie music conduct our favorites (glowing light sabers everywhere!), to the amazing flexibility of being permitted to bring your own food and adult beverages (great food/bev options to purchase as well, though a bit pricey), to the magic atmosphere and surroundings, it was something we will remember fondly. This place is not to be missed if you get the chance. Recommend staying at a nearby hotel within walking distance so as to avoid the parking nightmare (only a few small dedicated lots, and the rest bus in from remote park'n'rides or walk). Bench seats are mostly comfortable, but would recommend a stadium pad or blanket to soften things up a bit.",Borse1075

It is however currently equipped with a modern line-array configuration of multiple loudspeaker enclosures making any seat a good seat during a performance.",LeonKay
50,A Bucket List Experience for Couples and/or Family,"The Hollywood Bowl experience is not to be missed. Do not be intimidated by the crowds. The entire ambience is part of this exciting experience. Seniors can purchase $10 tickets for any remaining seats on Tuesday nights for $10. Sitting high up (cheaper) gives kids and adults a sense of being on top of the world and the huge screens capture the individual performances wonderfully. Catch the buses for $5 or $6 from any major section in Los Angeles and be dropped just feet from the box offices. And, by the way this the largest natural performance arena in the country. Acoustics are absolutely top notch. There are lots of escalators for the mobility challenged and especially areas for wheel chairs. The picnic areas are limited, so arrive early or do as we do and eat at your seat. Lots of food venues or save money and bring for own picnic. Alcohol is permitted. Purchase a cushion for your seat for just $1. and the programs are $1 also. We go many times during the summer. Just love it.",Christie C
50,Awesome venue !,"This iconic venue did not disappoint ! I don't know how many it seats, but it's huge! Acoustics are great and you probably rarely have to worry about bad weather! The bench seats were quite comfortable. It does require quite a bit of walking and takes more time than you'd expect to get in and out of. Parking lots are scattered around in the blocks nearby, but once inside the ""Bowl"" it still is a bit of a walk. There are a number of small picnic areas, but we ate before hand, and brought wine and plastic cups in to enjoy during the performance. I haven't been to many outdoor venues where you can bring wine to your seats. It's a nice touch! Listening to John Williams conduct ""Star Wars"" and watching half the audience waving light sabers was the icing on the cake. A night to remember.",happytravelerfromnva
10,Box office Customer Service Awful!,The box office staff is rude and has little knowledge of customer service. I had purchased tickets for a performance and could not go at the last minute. I tried to have the tickets switched to a friend - they were will call tickets - but they refused to even speak to me on the phone about it. I could have confirmed my credit card number - whatever they needed in order for my friend to use the tickets. Nathaniel in particular was really rude - as was the manager. I kept saying to my friend - can I speak with them - all they would say was no. I could hear them in the background refusing to speak with me. So two tickets went completely to waste - they were paid for in full.,greengardener

10,Beatles 50th Anniversary-tragically remembered!,"We were a little slow getting our tickets for this historic event and ended up in the bleachers, which still can be a fun place to watch the show. From the start, my thoughts were, we paid way too much for the tickets and if we could, would have stormed the box office for a full refund! HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe the Friday night performance. Lousy singing and a mediocre band playing iconic, legendary music... Stewart's ""family affair"" showing his kids more than the historical music was embarrassing to watch. Had our car not been boxed in we'd have left before intermission. Shame on the Bowl for ""showcasing"" such lame ""talent"" (good taste keeps me from truly saying what I'd like to say). We went the following weekend to our city's ""concert in the park"" starring a knock off group called ""Boogie Nights"". 10,000 people showed up for a free show and were thoroughly entertained!

50,Great Venue for Shows,Loved everything about our experience! I imagine we wouldn't have had such a great one if we hadn't read reviews that told us Not To Drive or Park there which was obvious when we walked up the hill from our hotel. What a nightmare! They have so many shuttle bus and park/ride options I would highly recommend them to anyone- or do like we did and stay at hotel close by. Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails rocked it!,Bosvegas
50,john williams at the hollywood bowl,"just saw john williams concert a the hollywood bowl. amazing venue! we had seats in nosebleed section and still was a great experience. there are 4 large screens that keep you close to the concert. wood benches in higher sections but you can rent a seat cushion for 1 dollar, good investment. parking is as bad as they say but there are 3 hotels with in 10 minute walk which would be the place to stay if you need a hotel. williams played all of his major theme songs, over a 2 1/2 hour concert.",Gary H
50,Summer under the Stars,Wonderful summer outing. Take a picnic and a bus from wherever you are (price is the best in town and you don't have to fight the traffic!) and enjoy some of the top entertainment in town.,divabo
50,A special place,"We saw 3 concerts here during our week's vacation. The Bowl is just a wonderful place to come to hear music. The sound is good, the views were great from wherever we sat, and we could access in and out quite easily from our car park next to the Best Western. It is the sense of history that the place has that makes it special. We cannot come to LA without coming to a concert here. Buddy Guy and Peter Frampton were fantastic, and John Williams is just the master and we are privileged to see him every year. If you are visiting this is a 'Must Do'.",NettyPoole
10,Awful Hollywood Bowl event Beatles 50th anniversary,"Love the bowl usually....however, this summer was a disappointment (primarily due to problems with the shuttle service from the Zoo) and then along came this abomination for a concert! The Bowl had a couple of other tribute concerts for the Beatles that used a variety of good talent worthy of the Beatles - but this made no sense. There is so much talent in LA - we really felt ripped off by this event (felt it was an insult to the Beatles); was complemented by a totally chaotic shuttle bus situation at the Zoo.",Californiagirl388
50,Nice evening out with family,"Just stepped off a flight from the east coast and attended the concert with John Williams. We had seats towards the back/ top of the Bowl. The sound was excellent and you can see everything that was going on around you. I liked that they allow you to bring in a cooler bag, with virtually no restrictions. We parked about a half mile away and walked in. I wasn't impressed with the way they park you. Reminded me of the days I took the ferry from The Continent to Emgland. You wait until everyone around you are in their vehicles before you can move. The venue has history, and it was nice to get a chance to enjoy outdoor entertainment at it's best.",Xeuropn
40,Any Seat is a Good Seat,"It's true that the closer seats will afford you a better view, but from all the seats the sound is great! And with the big screens, you can see the performers' faces and it's similar to being up front. We sat almost all the way up top to see the Independence Day Extravaganza and it was super!! The walk up to the higher levels is the only drawback to the less expensive seats. They have escalators that help with that though.",zoofamily
40,bowled over,"on the face of it not very exciting, but the overwhelming sense of history, of all the acts that have appeared is spine tingling. The sheer size of the auditorium is awe inspiring, as is the climb to the top. A trip for a cool day.",loopylin572
40,Always an entertaining evening and great sightlines,"We've been going to shows at the Hollywood Bowl every summer for many years now. Last weekend we went to the 50th Anniversary of the Beatles 1964 appearance at the Bowl. We had a four person box just in front of the front-of-house sound mix position.The on site catering from Patina Group delivered our dinners in a timely manner with appropriate charm and got the evening off to a good start. The show itself was quite disappointing so I'll focus this review on the venue.It does seem that wherever you end up seated you can hear and see the show despite the enormous audience area. The sound last weekend was pretty good but not excellent. It was clear and intelligible but there was too much low-mid frequency content so that the female voices sounded a bit masculine. At our location, perhaps a quarter of the way back from the stage, the sound was full but not too loud.In the boxes the seating is folding lawn chairs. They're okay but not all that comfortable. There's also a section with plastic seats and the rest is wooden benches. We've been in all the areas for different shows and they're okay. So no grumbles about the seating or the sound.In the past we've traveled to the Bowl by car and parked at the venue and we've also used the Park and Ride bus service. The latter has generally been the less stressful (unless you are affronted by happy drunks on the bus after the show - they're usually just entertaining as far as we're concerned). But this time the bus scheme was not at all up to par. We traveled from Pasadena and waited 35 minutes before we were let onto a bus. They let passengers with pre-booked bus ride tickets get on first and for the first half an hour the pre-paid passenger line kept getting longer as people arrived faster than they were being loaded onto the buses. The on-line pre-paid ride ticket sales close 48 hours before the show so be warned, if you're going to a popular show remember to pre-book the Park and Ride well ahead of time. At the end of the show at the Bowl you have to cross to the bus area through the tunnel which on this night kept blocking up with people so the crowd control folks held people back from entering and once let into the tunnel getting through to the other end was tediously slow. The buses line up in tight rows and passengers are supposed to walk down the small gap between these rows of buses to board their homeward bound bus. This was scary and dangerous with people lined up between moving buses. All the usher staff could come up with was to shout at passengers to stand in a single line!? It was a horrible experience. But, true to form, there were enough jolly drunks on the bus to entertain us all the way back to our car.",0591TimS
10,My letter to the LAPhil,"I have grown up at the Hollywood Bowl, worked there as a young man, and have always had the utmost respect and fondness for the performances and tributes I have had the fortune to attend at this lovely venue. But the travesty that was the ""50th Anniversary Tribute To The Beatles etc."" I had the misfortune to attend last Saturday casts a pall over all preceding concerts that came before and sullies the memory of the momentous occasion and the band it was meant to honor.To do such a disservice to all the many Beatles fans who ponied up hard earned cash to attend the sold out shows over the last weekend by offering such a low budget show is simply criminal. To offer the ""Stewart family band"" and ""Special Guests""(all of whom seemed to feel very little need to contribute either their energy or their time for rehearsal) for the prices commanded by the accomplished musicians we have come to expect at the Bowl seems to be a pure and simple money grab on the part of the Bowl and the LA Phil.For the first time in my life I feel compelled to request a refund of the money we paid for this event, and feel nothing but sympathy for the fellow concert goers who were fleeced out of much more than the $84.20 we paid for our tickets. Lost cause, I know... but this show was a serious black mark on an otherwise illustrious history of a famed institution, and I can only hope that maybe this letter - and those of the many others who feel as outraged as we - will help to keep major disappointments like this show from happening in the future.I heard Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were invited to attend. I am so glad they declined and were spared the embarrassment.",cattmandu
10,So disappointing!!!,"I had been looking forward to this event for months, it had the promise of a spectacular tribute to an iconic band. Sadly it feel so short I am still aggitated! The performers were fine in their own right, but not for this. The special guest vocalist were Dave Stewarts children….not what I paid to watch! This whole production was an insult to the Beatles, a moment in music history that will never come again, I expected this evening to be a 10 not a 2 .",rgashton
40,Great Venue - unless great grandpa comes with you,"Went to the Hollywood Bowl last Sunday for a Beatles tribute - great show...but here are some bowl tips - park in upper Terrance for 5 bucks extra - makes the nightmare stack parking exit much more bearable...also, flag down assistance for the older folks in your party unless you have the very best lower seats - the hill up to the mid level (and worse) seats can literally kill the infirm...we sat in a group of 10 seats together in P - about half way up...also, forget lugging the picnic food and simply hit the sort of secret and tucked away sushi bar just inside the north gate entrance - but bring your own wine and beer...When sitting at least half way up, use top bathrooms - much easier to hoof it up the stairs to the back than go all the way down cardiac hill and then kill yourself coming back up...also, bring your own seat cushion if on the north side - the dollar rental seat cushion booth is all the way on the south side...enjoy!",Theivyleaguer
30,Nine Inch Nails and SoundGarden,"2 great artists like this and they play a great show yet the HB has some major issues. Your beverage and food service is horrid. You miss an entire bands set for one drink. There is no reason it should take 1.5 to 3 minutes per person to get 1 or 2 beers. Slow staff and antiquated facilities. Also, you ban smoking cigarettes and the staff is on violators in a second. Yet they completely ignore 5 people passing weed pipes right next to him. The place is a weedfest, but don't have tobacco. Beautiful spot but you really need some work.",diablito93
10,I want a refund!,"You're probably heard of Annie Lenox from The Eurythmics, but perhaps you know less about her partner, Dave Stewart. The reason for his relative anonymity, became apparent Friday night, as he butchered a tribute to the iconic band, ""The Beatles"", who performed at the Bowl 50 years ago. You'd think such a noteworthy occasion would bring all kinds of talented musicians to the stage. Instead, Stewart used the event to showcase his three children, who quite frankly, are not ready for prime time. It was like watching the start of a season of American Idol, with all of the mistakes, but none of the ""gems"".Early in the show, Stewart recalled the time he was stoned, lying on a beach, with Paul and Linda McCartney. I guess that explains his inclusion in the show. I mean, what other musician can make that claim? What stellar qualifications!It was clear not only from his casting, but from his rough entrances and exits and introductions (""come on out here you"") that Stewart had no respect for the material or the audience.I can think of any number of GREAT vocalists who've faded a bit from the public eye, that could have brought down the house. Can you imagine Streisand singing ""Norwegian Wood"", or Tina Turner burning through ""Sgt Pepper""? How about Crash Test Dummies lead, Brad Roberts crooning ""While my Guitar Gently Weeps""? What is Susan Boyle doing nowadays? Hell, even Bruce Bowser from Sha Na Na, would have been an improvement!Four years ago, Cheap Trick performed the entire Sergeant Pepper's album backed by sitars and the bowl orchestra, and introduced surprise guest vocalists.But in this incarnation, the surprise vocalists, included Billy Ray Cyrus, who may have an achy breaky heart, but certainly didn't show it in this performance. He stomped around on stage, looking uncomfortable.Most of the vocalists at least got the words right. But the harmonies were erratic and the volume inconsistent. Mary Lambert covered ""Blackbird"", but her mike level was low at the start of the song and Dave Stewart was unable to recreate the iconic sound of McCarney's guitar solo, whose hand made bird-like sounds in the original, as it slid across the frets.I wasted $500 on a box for the show. Worse yet, I was embarrassed for the clients I invited. One started to nod off during the second half.HOLLYWOOD BOWL- you may say that you had no input..that you are solely a venue and have no responsibility for this disastrous show. But come on, the 1964 Beatles show was one of your milestones!I don't expect much from the sing alongs or the fourth of July fireworks shows. But the tepid applause during this program and the continuous stream of audience members heading for the exits, proves that my opinion was far from isolated.I usually spend thousands of dollars each season at the Bowl, but I'm starting to question my priorities.",Mark V
10,Beatles 50th,Very disappointing. I certainly expected a higher standard from the Bowl. It looked to be an opportunity for Dave Stewart to promote and showcase his family. Mr. Stewart is definitely not an inspired emcee and his singing ability seemed to me to be very weak. Sadly I found the whole show to be flat and rather amateurish.,Madeleine M
10,Beatles concert,"What we thought was going to be the concert of the summer of 2014, ended up being one of the worst. The only excitement of the evening was when practically everyone in attendance lit of their cell phone lights and transformed the audience into a light show. We have never been so disappointed.",Jill F
30,Beatles Show not that bad,"Don't know what expectations other reviewers had of the Beatles at the Bowl show, but compared to the original 50 years ago, this was fine. At least you could hear the words and music which the instrumentalists played quite well. Moreover, the slightly amateurish quality of Dave Stewart's kids fit right in with what I remember of the Fab Four back in 1964. Just look at the old footage and you'll see four pretty stiff young men trying to cope withthe non-stop screaming. True, the woman singing Eleanor Rigby butchered the song and Dave Stewart can't carry a tune, but let's be real - neithercould Ringo!The Bowl remains a great summer venue in the city for getting together with friends for a picnic, sipping wine during the performance, and letting your high critical standards take the night off because, after all, you are at a venue with electronic amplification, high definition video monitors, lighting displays or fireworks. And I'll bet that any carping in the bathrooms wasn't about the streamlined, efficient facilities. BTW, if you don't bring your own food, catering by Splichal Group offers a pretty good variety of meals for a price (not cheap).",301Lake
30,Beatles 50th@the Bowl-it wasn't THAT bad!,"Maybe by the time we went on Sunday night the kids weren't as nervous, but we didn't think it was all that bad. Dave Stewart made for a horrid ""ringmaster"" with his driveling comments and pauses between songs, but the individual guest artists were all solid. Vanessa Amorosi has some powerhouse chops and great stage presence and did the songs justice. Allen Stone was also great and fun to watch; too bad he only got to perform two songs. Hopefully this exposure won't destroy their promising careers. Yes, it was pathetic that Dave had his son perform about half the songs. He was nothing special and just tried too hard -- and then was completely blown out of the water when his younger sister, Kaya, came out to perform her single song. That girl can sing! (OK, she's doing the Miley Cyrus bleached and chopped hair thing, but that doesn't matter. She has the voice and she's only 14.) I think half the problems were with the sound system and whoever was mixing the sound did a crappy job. Martina's performance was wrecked by too much reverb and the guitars were drowned out by the drums during the first half. Thank goodness they brought in some brass and strings for the second half. And I have to say that it is always very cool to see the Bowl lit up by hundreds of waving cell phones -- even if they are to Billy Ray Cyrus' version of Hey Jude. We all sang along and had a good time anyway.",Jessica T
10,the worst concert we have seen at the Bowl,"The Hollywood Bowl administration should be ashamed of itself for allowing an amateurish concert like this to go on, and to promote it as something much more than it was. There was obviously a reason why the Bowl did not publicize who was joining Dave Stewart until two days before the event.",Sharon K

10,Beatles Tribute Night at the HB,"My letter to the HB:Last night (8/24) we attended the Beatles Tribute concert. Having read the reviews on Facebook and Trip Advisor, I was in disbelief that this tribute concert was going to be *that* bad. But, it was just that bad. The list is not that long, but very consistent: 1) off key vocals, 2) Stewart Family Night at the Bowl (perhaps a more appropriate title), 3) anemic performances. One performer was memorable, not for her name, but rather because she skipped an entire verse of Eleanor Rigby (while singing off key) and then had the respect for the HB and the crowd to start over....saying, ""This is the HB and you all know the words, can I please start over?"" Like most Angelinos, we have been coming to the HB for years...it is one of our summer destinations for great music, great concerts, great atmosphere...just a great night! We did not get any of that last night. While the instrumentals were pretty good, there were several off-synch moments. As avid concert-goers, we know that LA crowds are tough and last night was no different. But just as Billy Ray Cyrus got everyone on their feet.....they took a very long intermission. We were wondering why the intermission was so long and then figured out it had to be so that the evening would end closer to 10pm than to 9pm so it would *seem* as though we got our money's worth - they started around 745, talked for 15 minutes, played for 30, intermission for 30, then back on. We were in our car and on the freeway by about 10pm and we stayed until the very end. However, the intermission was great as they played a Beatles song through a super spectacular sound system! Shame on the HB for not cancelling the remainder of the performances after the first night of bad reviews. Shame on every performer who participated for even thinking that they could provide us with an evening of tribute when it was nothing more than a variety show-like environment. We even tried to take Bob Eubanks' advice and close our eyes and think of this as a tribute and not a replication - that was not a good idea as it made the off key and anemic performances even that much more so.We were truly disappointed.We hope that you will read this and take the time to read the reviews on trip advisor (where I will post this also), and we hope that you will take the time to respond to this.",Sue1009
10,Beatles 50th Tribute sounded like elderly frogs doing karaoke,Dave Stewart and his three children managed to kill the Beatles at the audience's expense. Michelle Branch flubbed her song so completely she had to start over. Everyone was booing Billy Rat Cyrus for his halfhearted throaty attempt to hit a few notes. An embarrassment for the bowl and Dave Stewart should never be allowed to organize a concert ever again. Even people in the bathrooms were talking about how terrible it was. I now must cleanse my ears from this band of nepotistic frogs mangling some of the worlds best songs. Boo.,Karebear828
10,Hollywood bowl 50th Beatles 2014,"Our family went to see the beatles 50th Friday at the Hollywood bowl. We were so excited prior to the performance and thought that Paul Mc Cartney and Ringo Starr would come out on stage. ,instead Dave Stewart had his 3 children (the Vontrap family singers!) with absolutely no professional tallent. This was a tribute to the beatles, one of the most famous bands since 1964. We paid $50 per seat, it was a huge disappointment,we should contact the promoter for a refund. I'm wondering if Paul McCartney, gave his permission, or previewed the concept of the evenings performance. Please start looking at other fan reviews, you will see a similar pattern of comments.i love the beatles, we listened and sang one of their CDs all the way home to Orange County. Just to let you know how bad Stewart's kids sang, a small child sitting behind us, turned to his father and said, is that kid going to sing again? This said it all, one of the absolute worst talent in honor of the greatest band on earth.",Celeslie C
10,Worst Concert Ever - Dave Stewart Beatles Tribute,"This was a horrible D-grade show ""curated"" by Dave Stewart. Apparently, his curation abilities don't extend past his own household, as his children were the unbilled feature performers. I, like everyone else in the Bowl, were expecting seasoned talent to perform for us. What I got for $500 was to watch Dave Stewarts children perform in a mockery of a ""show."" I will be contacting the Bowl on Monday about a refund.",Beachcruiser2011
10,Unforgivable!!!,"As the reviews below have made clear, the Beatles 50th at the Hollywood was atravesty!! If you're thinking of going tonight (Sunday)--don't. That the Bowl allowed its excellent brand to be smeared by this pap is very, very sad.",globalgourmet
10,What were they thinking???,"This was by far the worst night I've experienced at the Hollywood Bowl. The performance was disrespectful to the Beatles and the Hollywood Bowl. Who ever told Dave Stewart he could sing. And the one boy, I think it was a boy, singing just flat out didn't fit with any of the Beatles tunes. There was not passion by most of the singers and it didn't appear they were very well prepared. The Beatles were know for they energy, harmonies, and melody, all of which didn't exist last night. The two female back up singers were either out of tune or late. I want my money back!!!",t r
10,Beatles 50th Anniversary at the Hollywood Bowl,"Awful. After the first 30 minutes, I considered going to the box office to ask for my money back but we were with a group of people so I sat through it.

50,Love the Hollywood Bowl. Do not love what Dave Stewart did there.,"Dave Stewart is a great musician. And indeed, his guitar work on Friday was fabulous.But the rest of the night? WHAT? I can't say if his kids have talent or not, and where they will be in 10 - 15 years. I can say they were NOT ready to perform at the bowl even though they tried their best. They simply should not have been there.The highlights of the night were the guest singers, especially Liv Warfield's powerful rendition of ""Come Together"" and Allen Stone's two songs.So, a reminder that the Hollywood Bowl is an incredible venue. But without the right folks on stage it cannot soar.",midwestcitygirl
10,A Joke and Very Cynical of the LA Phil to make money this way...,"People were ripping it while it was going on... Amateur hour is right. (And yes, a couple of artists were good, but Stewart and his family? What was that?) We live in LA and there are many many accomplished artists who might have jumped at the chance to lead us all in some Beatles songs. Everyone so wanted this to be great night, but ugh!LA Phil owes us all a refund! Very cynical of them to make money this way. They should be ashamed!",Don B
10,An embarrassment to The Beatles and to The Hollywood Bowl management,"Just horrific! I'm one of the original fans that attended the August 23, 1964 concert at the bowl and I was really pumped up to celebrate 50 years later (check out the photo I attached. I'm the Beatlemaniac in the back waving the peace sign). This was not a concert! It was more like a karaoke contest with no winners. The acts reminded me of those on the old Gong Show. I kept saying...""Are you serious?"" Billy Ray Cyrus was horrible. Miley should have showed up and twerked. My highlight was seeing Bob Eubanks and Dave (The Hullabalooer) in the opening segment. The Hollywood Bowl management should be embarrassed for putting on stage acts that were amateurish and hokey. Most of the singers couldn't hold a tune and to hear this done to Beatles' songs, I was offended. Paul and Ringo should sue. John and George must've rolled over in their graves. We wanted to leave early but we came on the Park & Ride bus, which didn't leave until 30 minutes after the ""concert"" - if you want to call it that. I'll say a little prayer for those concert-goers that have tickets to tonight's third and final performance. I'll think twice about my future interest in Hollywood Bowl events. There's too many quality productions out there to waste my time and money something like this.",MusicFromWithin
10,Beatles Anniversary Show-What A Train Wreck!,"Friday night we went to the Beatles Anniversary Show and it was absolutely the worst show we had ever seen anywhere! It was so bad it was actually embarrassing to watch. Dave Stewart from the Eurythmics was the emcee and was not able to carry the songs he sang. What was worse, Stewart used the show to showcase three of his children whose talent was even more lacking. Even Billy Ray Cyrus, who at least has a name in the music business, was absolutely horrible , singing off key so bad we were actually laughing throughout the performance. Judging by comments we heard from many other concert goers that night we were not alone in our opinions. Hollywood Bowl, you should have known better. What a disgrace especially since the show was suppose to be a tribute to The Beatles. I would suggest that whoever is responsible for ensuring the quality of the shows at The Bowl really take a look at what happened here so that the concert goers at The Bowl never waste their time and money on another show there.",ScottinLB

10,Worse concert ever at the Bowl (The Beatles 50th),I have never seen nor heard anything so awful! It was more like a bad high school talent(less) show than something the Bowl would ever put on. It was a Dave Stewart Family showcase - nothing more. We walked out mid-way through and we weren't the only ones. I was in tears - How could they do this to our Beatles. Billy Ray Cyrus butchered Hey Jude and I won't even talk about what Dave Stewart's kids did to the songs.

50,"Great sound, great experience","The Hollywood Bowl is filled with entertainment history and yet is probably not high on lots of tourist lists. Yet by going to a concert here you get a very LA experience, as others have noted. We parked in the Hollywood United Methodist Church parking lot at Hollywood and Highland for $15. It was a safe, uphill,15-minute walk to an entrance of the Hollywood Bowl. We had brought our dinner, like lots of locals do, and ate on picnic tables. Then we visited the intriguing Bowl museum. Finally, we entered with our tickets and saw a great show. The acoustics are brilliant, as you would imagine they would be in an entertainment capital. Two very sharp, big screens on each side of the stage help to capture the show. We easily walked out after the show, down the hill, and to our parked car, where there were people from the church still sitting in the lot, watching the cars. Those who park in the Bowl lot were in for a long wait of getting out because the parked cars are stacked. There are also shuttle buses to many locations. Check online. Several hotels line North Highland Ave as well.",GoGoGeekGirl

50,Does it get any better than The Bowl?,"I live in LA and nothing makes me so sad as to see tourists bumbling along Hollywood Blvd looking at the stars on the sidewalk and having to deal with those awful charactered dressed (thugs). All I want to do is scoop them up and tell them, ""Let's put you through tourist detox right now, we're going to The Bowl"". I have been going to the bowl for years. I don't go on the glamour nights with the pop stars. I tend to go for the LA Phil nights or the Movie Nights. I still get weepy over sitting in a box with my 10 year old for Pixar night a few years ago... anyway, I digress. My suggestion for visitors to LA go to Hollywood Blvd for about 30 minutes. Yes, look at Grauman's and the stars on the sidewalk. Park your car at Hollywood & Highland. Get something from starbucks so you have some kind of validation. Then after you walk your 30 minutes on the sidewalk and grauman's leave your car and walk up to the Bowl. You will have preordered your tickets online and pick upat box office. It will take about 15-20 minutes to walk from Hollywood & Highland to Box Office at Bowl. Try to back up your trip so you arrive at the bowl by 6:15. You will dine at the bowl. various facilities to choose from, go online to see the menues. If you can bring a tablecloth that would be great. No seats are bad at the bowl. All good (IMO). If you want to splurge and go for a Box seat, you can dine in your box with the catered meal ordered online. Or you can pick up something in the restaurants there at the bowl and take to your box. If you Live in LA I'm not sure you are even reading about The Bowl in Tripadvisor..but if you are. Park in the lot on the east side of Highland. It is stacked parking. It is not the end of the world. Again, get their early 6:15..and you can bring food from home or put an order in some place like Joans on Third and they will pack a picnic for you. It will be a fantastic night for all!",TracyHawaii

Excellent viewing ( many screens if too far from stage) and sound is fantastic. A must.",jalma3

Then watch the people at the Bowl - it's often a show for itself. And then the show.Great atmosphere. Don't leave LA without having watched a show at the Bowl.",190sl
10,Evening ruined by shuttle bus,"After a wonderful evening of music at the Bowl, my group experienced a nightmare trying to return to our vehicle on one of the shuttle buses. The staff members were rude, disorganized, dismissive and deliberately unhelpful. What should have been a short ride turned into a two hour nightmare, overshadowing the evening's performance. Use any other means of transportation to get to the Bowl! Avoid the shuttle buses.",Robin G
50,Superb and Stunning Venue,"I went to a Tchaikovsky concert with fireworks and had a very enjoyable experience. We brought a picnic with us and had it in our seats in the 45 minutes or so before the concert. Although we were in the nosebleed section (just half a dozen or so rows from the very back), the acoustics were superb. The setting itself is marvelous with a beautiful backdrop that includes the Hollywood Sign. All in all one of the must things to do and savor if you live in or are visiting Los Angeles.",vincemc
50,A Spectacular Evening!,"Going to the bowl takes planning, and you definitely want to be in the bowl and at your picnic 90 minutes before your show begins. PARKING: the bowl charges around $18, and it can be quite a wait to get your car out after the show. There is parking just south of the bowl in Highland for a bit more, and much easier to get out. Just wear good walking shoes. PICNIC: bring lots of yummy stuff, as it's a delight to picnic at your seats or a table. If you want a picnic table, you must arrive several hours in advance. It's lovely to eat at the seats too, as the ambiance can't be beat! SEATS: we love section M; not too pricy and great view. I recommend choosing a show with fireworks- really fun for kids. A truly fun night!",MariK888
50,You Must Go,"My husband and I bought tickets to the Hollywood Bowl at the last minute. The tickets were in section M2. They were pretty far back but it was my husbands first time to go and I didn't want to spend a bunch of money if he didn't like it. Needless to say.. HE LOVED IT! We had seen Tchaikvosky with Fireworks Show. The music was just beautiful and to be under the stars is amazing. To top it off Alexandra Soumm was playing with the group. I didn't know her until the show but wow. She is 25 years old and just such a talent. Lastly, the fireworks are so cool. They are timed with the music and really cap off the night. Here are a few things you need to know. 1) Parking is difficult, so take the Park and Ride Shuttles. They are so fast, safe and easy!!! We took the one from Sherman Oaks and it was perfect. We will do that every time. 2) You can bring your own wine and food to the show. Just pack a bag and you are good. You can also buy food, wine, drinks at the Hollywood Bowl or get box dinners ahead of time. Up to you, but people are all bringing their items so get as elaborate as you want, 3) bring a cushion to sit on. You can rent them for $1.00 but you can bring yours too. Lastly.. relax this is so much fun for the family or with friends!",Misty K
50,A concert to remember,"To travel to a place you have only read about or seen on television and to have it be bigger and better than you expected is the best. Big, charismatic with the 'wow' factor. An impressively cool place.",Grace H
50,Unique experience under the night sky,"The natural amphitheater has excellent acoustics for opera or a symphony concert. There is nothing like an outdoor concert where you can hear every note. Parking is plentiful but expensive - public transit (yes - in L. A.) is a better option. Food and drink are available, but pack your own picnic if you have access to the essentials. Alternatively, you can buy a picnic in a box. The box seats up front offer table service - $$$. Late comers are seated at a suitable break, and talking during performances is discouraged - there is a code of conduct to which patrons are expected to adhere.We saw the L.A. Philharmonic perform Russian Firsts and the sound was bell-clear. Bring binoculars if your seats are on the second or third tier. Even on warm days, as the sun sets it gets cool, so bring a blanket or warm sweater. There are seat cushions for rent if you don't bring one.We will go back next time we are in L.A. No matter who is performing.",HarlanRegina_Canada
50,Not to be missed- a night under the stars,A concert at the Hollywood Bowl is a must for visiting l.a. We heard the L.A. Philharmonic. Absolutely beautiful summer evening. We had bench seats- worth it to spring for the $1 cushion and then very comfortable. Great sound and big screens to get a close up view. We took the shuttle from the Hollywood and Vine Metro station which was free with our TAP card and so easy.,kagardner
50,Quintessential Los Angeles Showstopper,"A trip to the Bowl is a treat no matter what the performance. Despite the HUGE crowd and sometimes parking challenges, there is just nothing like it. Sitting under the stars, listening to amazing music of all genres and if you time it right fireworks . . . classic! If you don't mind making an entire evening of it, go early to get parking and a nice picnic spot. There are picnic tables in the park on Highland, but even better are the hidden tables up two escalators and around the back of the bowl. You can dine in a beautifully shaded glen and get to your seats within a few minutes when it's time for the music to begin.",OhKellyTravels
40,What a Nice Venue,"Went to see Gladys Knight. The Venue is open air. My seats were on the 3rd Promenade but I could see pretty good. I suggest getting here early and using the shuttles to get here because the parking and traffic can be challenging. Many people bought coolers and food into the concert and there are plenty concessions although they are a bit pricey. they sell wine, beer and they even have a mini market where you can purchase botttles of wine or cans/ bottles of beer.",1Calitraveler
50,One of the World's Great Amphitheatres,"The Hollywood Bowl is a terrific venue to see a concert. The sound system is good for an outdoor venue. The Bowl seats about 20,000 people and, as a result, tends to book acts big enough to fill the seats (Billy Joel, Tom Petty, the Eagles to name a few). Parking is usually very difficult, so you are strongly advised to use a park and ride, either the service provided by the Bowl itself or similar offerings from local restaurants. Seeing a concert at the Bowl is a wonderful experience, even if you weren't there when the Beatles played the venue 50 years ago.",Eric G

30,A 4th of July that We Will Always Remember - The Bowl!,"The Hollywood Bowl was one of the sites I really wanted to see in LA.; the bowl is almost a shrine to outdoor artistic entertainment. When we firmed up our plans to visit LA, we looked at the Bowl's schedule and were delighted to see that not only were they having a 4th of July Fireworks Spectacular with the LA Philharmonic, but the evening also featured Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers featuring Edie Brickell. The evening was a delight; the music and fireworks were indeed a delight. Steve Martin complete with his banjo and band, was wonderful. Half way through Martin's concert, a lone figure started to walk across the stage with a guitar over his shoulder - Paul Simon. (Edie Brickell is Paul's wife.) What a delightful added attraction to an already unforgettable evening.Nestled in the valley north of Hollywood in the hills is the famous Bowl. It was warm evening with a soft breeze under the bright stars at the Hollywood Bowl. The sound quality is great, and the venue is unique - a working monument to the arts. I could not have asked for anything more perfert than listening to talented artists in the spectacular view of the Hollywood Bowl! See it - take a tour - better yet, attend a concert here; you will not be sorry.",Carl A

The concerts are meant to help kids become aware of music from different parts of the world. The 5 week concert series changes every week. The first week they had live music from Africa, the next one from India, etc. After each concert they had art crafts for the kids to do based on the music they were listening to. The area the kids were in was completely shaded. The kids had great front stage floor seats. The concerts occur next to the museum not in the bowl. They have a few seats around the performing area from parents. The performers are usually also performers performing also in the bowl. The concession stands are open selling cereal, peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, hummus with pita bread etc. We had a great time dancing, listening to music & doing art. We will DEFINITELY be signing up for the series next summer.",Fffly

10,"Lovely Venue, City does a horrible job with traffic logistics.","The hollywood bowl is an amazing experience, one of the best concert venues we have ever attended. But the way they deal with the traffic to and from the bowl is so incredibly horrible that we will never attend again. It's really sad to say, but you can tell that the bowl is run by the city because if it was private, they would fix the problem. It will take you 2 hours to get the last 12 blocks to the bowl, and at least 2 hours to get out of it. They have dozens of police and traffic cops there solely to direct the city buses in and out of the area, at the expense of everyone else in any other vehicle. Seriously, they have ""spotter"" traffic cops that look out for busses on the freeways, and when they see one, they stop everyone in every direction and let the buses through. ( we saw one traffic officer stop a non-siren fire truck to let a bus through )",Luxguide

50,Classic Hollywood experience,"I'm not a big fan of orchestral music, but I wanted to go to the Hollywood Bowl because I had seen so many great pictures. I went for a Katy Perry/Ellie Goulding concert so it wasn't your usual picnic and wine vibe, but it was a fantastic venue nonetheless. Get there early for any type of performance so you can enjoy all the food and drink options at the Bowl. There are multiple parking lots near the Bowl, but all will involve some walking. A shuttle runs from the Hollywood & Highland metro stop right up to the front entrance (the shuttle leaves from one of the back entrances to H&H so make sure to ask and wait in the right spot, it is NOT where the metro escalators are).",DeniseMW

Stacked parking is limited and expensive. I'd recommend the ease of shuttle buses and sensible shoes for the walking. This is definitely a must-do!",Cattylea

40,Great concert experience,"We were at the Hollywood Bowl this week for a rock concert. It is a fabulous venue and definitely worth the trip if you have never been. It was tricky to figure out what was the best way to get there, so that is really why I am posting here. What we decided on and what worked well was to park in the huge parking garage at Hollywood and Highland (max price $13 parking) and then walk from there. It is approx. 20 min/ 1 mile with a slight but long incline, so if you are not physically capable of doing this, it might not work for you. Could not find out if shuttles ran from there or not. There are other private pay lots as you walk up Highland ranging in price from $20-40, but they really pack these tight, so you are at the mercy of who is leaving when. The bowl itself is also uphill. There are moving walkways to take people to the upper levels.Beer, wine (including bottles), and sangria are available onsite, but no hard liquor. We purchased some takeout food from the marketplace and got a wrap sandwich and a cheese plate. They also have sushi and other gourmet snack items like hummus and crackers. We did not have the tables, but we had good plastic seating in the center sections. The side and rear sections are wooden benches, and people could rent cushions.Leaving the venue, it was also easy to walk down to the Hollywood/Highland parking garage and then easy to get out. We were back at our hotel exactly one hour after the show ended, which we thought was pretty good.People did tend to congregate in the aisles of the stairs, and they were not cleared out by the ushers. It was a little challenging to have to use the restroom or get concessions because of this. We were not very high up, but it was still annoying and poses a safety risk.",GSC4ever
50,A special place,"This is a fantastic summertime venue, and a must-see for fans of the performing arts. I've now seen three shows here since July 2013, including two featuring the LA Philharmonic. There is something special about this place, no matter who is performing. It is magical sitting under the calm LA summer sky as the sun sets and the music surrounds you. Each time I've gone, I've been alone and have sat in the ""Super Seats."" These seats are stadium style and are about midway back from the stage to the back of the house. The view is just fine from these seats and they're affordable. I haven't sat on the benches farther back, though I could tell that they had been replaced since last season. If you're with a group of four or so, you might consider Terrace seating.There are plenty of great food options within the Bowl, from high-end picnic baskets to a hot dog and chips.Lots of history here, including past performances by Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, the Doors, and more recent shows by Queen Latifah and John Legend. This will always be a destination for me during summer visits to LA.",Eric R
50,4th July Celebrations,"Attended the 4th July Celebrations with the LA Philharmonic and Steve Martin, fantastic, we sat fairly close to the stage in little booths with tables, really nice way to go. Highly recommend going to something there if you get a chance.",57Babs57

From the wonderful, historic and beautiful venue to the great dinner from their on-site gourmet market to the fun and energetic crowd, the evening could not have been more perfect! We had box seats which were fantastic, complete with comfy chairs and tables to make our dinner easy and enjoyable. I would recommend an evening at the Hollywood Bowl to anyone who wants the quintessential old-school LA experience! Loved it!",JWLMontgomery_AL
50,The Joys of Summer...,"I love, love, love this place! My husband and I are seasoned tickets holders, but sometimes the line up in certain packages are not to our liking so we'll just purchase individual shows but we never miss a season. If you live in, near or visiting Los Angeles, this is a must do, and not just once but every summer. Period. Full stop.One of the great things about the Bowl is that you may bring your own food and alcohol; as much as you could tug. On site there is Patina Restaurant, which is quite lovely, a few to-go food nooks on site and picnic packages are available for purchase. There's also a picnic area with tables to dine before the event (first come basis), but we prefer to get to our seats early to eat, drink and enjoy the magnificent art of people watching as they parade into the Bowl, never a dull moment. For the most part, it really doesn't matter where you sit, rather it's all about the company and the music. And a big plus is that the Bowl is relatively inexpensive, $11-$240+ depending on how close you wish to be to the stage and its wheel chair accessible throughout the Bowl.Parking is tandem, so exiting could be quick or a nightmare, so be patient; generally, it could take approximately 15 - 20 minutes to be able to drive out; fee is $17+ and reservation is recommended. The alternative is to take the shuttle, which has pick up and drop off locations in various cities throughout LA County, (usually at a park or mall parking lot, where parking is free) fee is $5/person round way, small children ride for free. Reservations is recommended; more info is available on their website.Simply put, summer in Los Angeles is not complete without spending some time at the Hollywood Bowl; one visit and you're hooked!",NovieW
50,Beautiful venue under the stars,"A beautiful place to attend a concert, especially on a mild summer night. The garden boxes are wonderful. Not only is the view of the stage excellent, but you have a little folding table for your picnic dinner, which you can order once you get there or ahead of time. Don't bring any drinks because they will be poured out before your entry. No problem since a well stocked boutique has excellent wines which they decork and pour into a plastic container for you to enjoy in two plastic wine glasses. Your server also has a very nice wine list.",Marilyn E

50,Thumbs up for Boz Scaggs,"I hate to say this, but I hadn't heard Boz since the 70s. He certainly does not disappoint! He's still a great blues and rock musician. Eliane Elias, who opened the evening, had a wonderful throaty Brazilian souond, and Lee Ritenour / Dave Grusin, the middle act, were great, too. And the Bowl, updated with the big screens and excellent sound, make for a beautiful summer's evening of entertainment.",Vicki K
40,I REALLY LOVE this venue....but....,"Love love love the world famous Hollywood Bowl. I love to imagine all the incredible artists that have played here over the years. I love the sound, the lights, the backdrop, the Bowl itself. All of it...awesome! What I am liking less and less about it, however, is the COMPLETE HEADACHE from the logistics of getting to a show here. If you decide to drive... you get to look forward to STACKED PARKING (seriously, WHO invented THIS horror??) and some of the MOST INSANE concert traffic you will ever experience in your life. The other option is, for a very nominal fee, you can purchase a roundtrip ticket on the Park and Ride Nonstop Shuttle that will take you directly to the Hollywood Bowl without you personally having to deal with the traffic. It is, in my opinion, the lesser of two evils, however...you have to drive to the Park and Ride destination (there are many to choose from all over the city), then you need to understand that you are NOT leaving the concert until the bus leaves, which is approximately 20 minutes after the show ends. I just always feel so much ""pressure"" when it comes to shows at the Bowl. I don't live within walking distance and I'm not a big fan of busses, but I also am not fond of sitting in concert traffic for hours before and after a show.Will I continue to go? Yes of course...although my weeknight show attendance is basically nonexistent. Still... That said......The Hollywood Bowl is TOTALLY FANTASTIC.",Sally M
50,Bernstein and Gershwin at the Hollywood Bowl under a full moon,"On a clear, cool night, attended by an almost full house of devoted fans,The LA Philharmonic, led by the always entertaining Bramwell Tovey, played American classics by Leonard Bernstein and the Gershwins like Rhapsody in Blue, An American in Paris and Broadway show tunes from On the Town and Candide. The scheduled pianist was absent so Bromwell himself played brilliantly while conducting. And to add to hismany talents, he has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of classical and pop music and gives context to the composers and tunes in very humerous introductions.The Hollywood Bowl itself, has spruced up some of the common areas like more moving sidewalks in the upper areas, and modernized the previously funky bathrooms with new lighting, doors, an fixtures.

The Philharmonic started the evening off with a patriotic theme and then Steve Martin and his Steep Canyon Rangers performed. I knew Steve could play the banjo but I had no idea how well and of course he told little funny stories in between tunes. I especially like the fiddle player Nicky Sanders. Then the fireworks while the Philharmonic and the U S Air Force Band of the Golden West played. Wow!!! Steve finished with a solo banjo tune.",Greeley_COWizard

40,Splurge for the box seats,"For years I've been going to the Hollywood Bowl with my family. Some years we park at the Bowl (stack parking, ick!), some years we get there super early and picnic, and some years we eat at our seats. Regardless of the years, we've always sat in the ""cheap seats"" which really aren't that cheap (usually about $50-75 a pop for a family of 6).This year my family made their own plans for July 4, so I decided to take Stephen to the Bowl for the Steve Martin, Edie Brickell and others concert with the LA Phil. About 4 days prior to the concert, I checked TicketMaster and I guess a few Terrace Box seats opened up, with tickets going at $159 before slew of service fees. They were a bit more than the cheap seats, but they were face value and I've ALWAYS wanted to sit in the box seats.O-M-G I don't think I'll be able to sit in the nosebleed ever again. We were in Terrace 5, just slightly off to the dead center of the Bowl. Decent view of the performers, but the jumbotron made up for that, and excellent view of the fireworks spectacular.It was nice sitting down at a table for dinner, and the staff did a pretty good job of setting up our box, taking down our table, and even bringing coffee during intermisson (for $4).You can buy a picnic basket from Patina's for $69, or buy the food sold there, or bring your own. I decided to go ""ethnic"" and bring vietnamese spring rolls from Brodards (from LIttle Saigon), along with Bun (noodles), macarons, and cheesecake from 85degree cafe.Its definitely a ""bucket list"" place to visit, and every person should splurge at least once for the box seats.Don't bother to drive yourself to the Bowl. If you can, use the ""park and ride"" shuttle. For $7 per person (pre purchase) or $10 on site, the bus will drop you off at the top of the hill, and its easy to get home, too. You get the park and ride info at the Hollywood Bowl web or on Ticketmaster.Best 4th of July experience I've had in a very long, long time.",callmemochelle

This was Hall of Fame induction night so we had the pleasure of hearing Pink Martini, The Go Go's and Kristin Chenoweth perform and get inducted (unbelievable). The Show included a laser light show and fireworks! The place was rocking and I'd go again in a minute. Parking is fearsome. Best bet is to park at the bottom of the LONG hill for about $15 or $20 and hike up the street. If you park up top you'll be ""stacked"" and you will never get out.",Paul C

30,Rather disappointing,"Well it was an experience to go to a gig at the Bowl - but not a great experience.I was well to the back - the gig wasn't sold out so there was plenty of room, but I felt I was just too far away to hear and see at the level of detail I like. Even with the big screens at the side (bizarrely the video was out of synch on these), there was not enough detail - and I felt like I was rather watching a film from a long way back rather than being at a gig.Other issues are the crowds. obviously it is big so crowd management is always going to be a problem, and don't tkake your car - getting out of the parking lot is a nightmare.Benches are also hard and generally uncomfortable. It can also get pretty chilly when the sun goes down - so take something warm",rexbarker

We used the Ventura lot for a free bus ride (with a metro card) to the venue, the bus let us out right in front. Once inside it was very easy to get to our seats. We were sitting up on the benches so we paid the couple dollars for the seat cushions - good investment!The venue is great for a concert with a great backdrop of the hills and the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign. The video screens are great and the sound was really good for an outdoor venue.",metfanatic11
40,It is so well known for a reason!,Great acts come here and the acoustics are good. I have only been to semi mellow concerts here. Safety was always felt and not worrying about a flying beer was nice. I would not hesitate to ever attend here. Parking is a little bit of a pain.,Bill T
40,Chicago!,"I saw Chicago here last year with Samantha Barks, Ashlee Simpsons, Stephen Moyer and so on. It was a great performance. The staff is helpful. The only thing is that the street gets packed, but it's really not an issue.",lilims123
50,Excellent venue,Really not a bad seat in the place to see the stage or to hear the musicIt can be a long walk to refreshments however,Lily M
50,James Taylor Under The Stars - No Better Place To See Him,"Been to the Bowl many times. Bought tickets at the last minute. If you can afford to get in a Garden or Terrace Box, DO IT. It is so worth it to get the full Hollywood Bowl experience. However, if you are heavier set (230 lbs. plus), the box seats might seem tight. The boxes hold 4 and 6 people, so if you only buy a pair, get ready to meet someone new.Check your event rules. Sometimes you can bring in your own, wine with your picnic. If you don't have time to make your picnic food, you can order a gourmet dinner online from Joaquim Spichal's Patina.Do not drive and Park at the Bowl. It is a hassle and can be very expensive, starting at $25 and up. Sometimes you are stack-parked and will not be able to leave until other concert goers parked around you leave too. Check out the Bowl Bus from outlying areas - $5 bucks or the Metro which has a stop at Hollywood & Highland a few blocks south of the Bowl. We usually take the Metro. It's a little bit of a hike uphill to get to the Bowl, but after the concert, it's downhill to the Metro station.",Nicolette A. Munoz Consulting

50,We saw James Taylor at the Hollywood Bowl!!,"I have always wanted to see a show at the Hollywood Bowl and when I learned that James Taylor was there, that was my chance! My daughter and I bought tickets the day of the show and headed to Hollywood! I had always heard that the Hollywood Bowl was awesome. I was overly surprised at just how awesome it was. The staff there was really organized and friendly. Parking was easy, getting into the venue was easy, finding dinner and drinks was easy, and then finding our seats was easy. It was so enjoyable to sit in this beautiful outdoor venue surrounded by really great people, great weather, and listening to James Taylor, my childhood favorite. The Hollywood Bowl is definitely a fantastic place to catch a show. I can't wait to go back!",Lisa W
50,Hollywood under the stars!,The concerts at night are highly recommendable! Imagine Hollywood under the stars! Literaly ... stargazing!!! It can be as peaceful as it can get since the area is on a higher elevation and you don't hear the traffic and mobil patrol sirens.,inspire8
50,Best venue to see a concert,Once in your lifetime you should see a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Great outdoor setting with cubicles that hold 4 chairs. Each cubicle has a portable table that connects to the side of it if you go early to eat your picnic at your seats. They also have a wine/beer store on sight you can buy wine or beer to take to your seats. No glass allowed so they put it in large cup containers. 3 large screens are set up so there are no bad seats. The only thing to remember is if you sit closer to the back it is bench seating.,love2travelCalgary
50,James Taylor Concert at Hollywood Bowl,"We caught a shuttle bus from Westwood, there and back. Buy tickets for that on line otherwise you wait in a queue while all the pre-purchase ticket holders get on first on the way there, no trouble on way back.I'm glad we got the shuttle because the traffic was horrendous as lots of Los Angelians think they can drive to the venue.The setting of the Bowl is magnificent and every seat has a view.Big screens also help, but suggest you take binoculars.We took our own picnic hamper. You can't take glass cups or bottles in the gate, so repack your wine and take plastic cups.You can buy wine and beer at expensive but not horrendous prices. There is also a wide choice of food vendors, but I didn't need to try them.We sat in bench seating, so a cushion or blanket may be a help.Be prepared for the temperature to drop as the sun goes down.An experience to remember no matter which artist or performance you see there.Seating capacity is over 17,000 people and it was full for the James Taylor concert.",Forestaus
50,Sneak in on a Weekday Morning,"Apparently, the LA Philharmonic rehearses there on Tuesday and Thursday mornings - although that was not the case this Past Tuesday. However, just park close by and hike up to the venue...it is very cool to sit there when the space is empty and glorious.",9oaks
50,The Holy Grail of Concert Venues!,"This is the place to see anything. I have been to the Hollywood Bowl several times over the years and I can tell you there is not a bad seat in the house. I recently saw James Taylor and he is perfection, but over the years I have seen Paul McCartney, John Williams with James Taylor (on the 4th of July with Fireworks), Simon and Garfunkel, Carol King with James Taylor, and many others. Bring your kids, come with a friend or a special date - it's all good - just go!",Brenda L
40,Great Venue,"I had really bad seats, near the canyon rim. Sound was very good, however. Large screens to view stage action. Lovely night sky. Everything was organized and efficient.",Mark S
40,Well organised venue,"My girlfriend and I went to see Billy Joel at the end of May. It was the easiest concert I have ever attended, ushers were fantastic, very helpful. Seating was easy to work out. Drinks around site weren't too overpriced, the only failing was they shut the bar a third of the way through the concert which I found bizarre. This didn't effect me as I was one of the last people to get a drink but a lot of people were left disappointed",lunchcritic1

50,Fantastic outdoor venue,"Great views and incredible atmosphere on a nice summer night. Many people were bringing in bottles of wine and picnic food. I'm not sure if you can do this in all seating areas, but it's worth checking. The wine for sale was OK but pricy at $40/bottle. If you can get your hands on them, go for the garden box seats.I recently attended a top-billed show here and the celebrity-spotting in this area was (almost) as good as the concert itself.",Sunny77777
40,Great venue,"Had a great time at the Barry Gibb concert. Do not park here, take a shuttle. The shuttle from the LA zoo was fine. The waiter in Pool E was super. Met some very interesting people in our section.",OutOnTheRange
50,Stars under the stars at the Bowl!,"Attending concerts at the Bowl is something everyone must do when in L.A. Fabulous line-up, great acoustics, party atmosphere, beautiful setting. Personally, love getting a great seat but the price range fits every budget. You can picnic or lots of food choices. Box seats are wonderful! You can have meal delivered to table or bring your own feast. Seat 4 - 6 people, make some new friends for the evening. Staff sets up a table for you in box seats. Even benches, newly replaced, are comfortable. Seat cushion only $1. Be sure to read website info about what you can/can't bring. Differs depending on Bowl line-up or lease events. Don't whine when they take away your umbrella, you didn't read the info. Yes, a few drops fell before Billy Joel's concert two weeks ago... get over it, Billy Joel ROCKED! Where else can you see the best in rock, jazz, classical, pop, musical theatre sing-a-longs AND be seated WITH celebs! I kept staring at Adele during Aretha's concert!Ignore those who complain about parking... natives know that goes with living in a fabulous, large city with a lot of attractions. Parking is $22, but the shuttle is $7 and easy enough. People in L.A. are notorius for leaving early, as if on curfew, and therefore don't like stacked parking (tightly parked cars, all lined to exit in order). Always amazed at the courteous, helpful staff. Helps to check, in advance, to see if Dodgers/Lakers/Clippers/Kings, etc. have events. Depending on where you are traveling from, this can effect your travel time.So DO come with the right attitude and it will be time and $ well spent. LOVE the Bowl!!",101travelers
40,What Fun,"Big Names, Fun Times, many seats, bring some treats! You can come alone, bring friends, bring your entire company....you might be able to fit the entire Tomorrow-land section if DLR here!Whet here you take a seat in the back row(s), bring a sturdy behind...gets tough if you don't bring a cushion, or get a $$$ seat down front, you will have a blast. There are no bad seats due to the big screens.You can buy food here, we prefer to eat before hand and bring a snack, leave glass behind. If you have trouble walking, come early, you can get help with parking and an elevator ride and assistance to your seat. Best to have a wheelchair if you need it. Not the best venue, like Walt Disney of others like it.I cannot say I have not enjoyed each performance but my favorites are always around or in the 4th if Juky.",Holly K
50,Perfect Venue for a Summer Concert,Nothing like a summer evening under the stars - great acoustics in an awesome setting. Parking is horrible so park off site or take the shuttle if possible. Nice picnic areas & also box seats w/ tables - our favorite LA concert site.,HappyVagabond2458
50,A Bucket-list must have,"I have been to dozens of concerts and performances here over the years, and they have rebuilt the shell for ideal acoustics. It is beautiful, they have made it easy to get in and out even with 50,000 other people. I go at least once a year.",Greg W
50,Great Place!!,"I've been to many concerts in many different venues but I don't believe any of them are as good as the Hollywood Bowl. The venue itself is spectacular. Outdoor seating looking down at a huge stage. Giant screens located in strategic spots to give you close up views of the performers on stage. For me, the sound system is great. How many venues allow you to bring in food, drinks and alcohol. I've never been to another one that allows that. Getting there early is fun, because there are thousands of people sitting everywhere having their picnic lunches enjoying a really fun atmosphere. It seems like the performers give it a little extra because they are performing at the famous Bowl. It must be surreal experience for them to look up at that huge crowd.There are of course negatives. The parking sucks, unless you know like I do where to park (I'm not giving away my secret). And traffic getting there is always a problem. But its all worth it, cause it's the BOWL!!!",berniek1949
50,Picnic,Had a nice picnic here in a great area under the purple trees. Beautiful setting and backdrop for pictures. Lots of shade with sun poking through. Great times!!,JCavall
40,Journey Concert,"Went to see Journey concert at the Hollywood Bowl with family, we had a lot of fun. Great venue to see any concert, had tickets for the back rows, but the sound was still amazing. Use $ 1.00 seat cushions. Read a lot about parking, stack parking at the venue or off site parking lots, Metro and so on, decided to do stack parking at the venue, after the concert had to wait for the cars in front of us to move, but overall was not so bad, took us maybe 1/2 hr to get on the Freeway. There are lots of picnic places inside the bowl, take a basket and enjoy the Hollywood hills inside the venue.Overall great music and great family outing",Leinad17

50,Don't Miss It if You're Going to a Concert,"I've been to the museum so many times and always enjoy it. I am not sure i would make a special trip here, but if you are attending a concert it is a great way to pass time and also to take in the history of the Bowl. Great artifacts from programs past (tickets, photos, and some fantastic videos from past concerts). You can easily spend time here and then feel you are really immersed in the venue and ready to make your own history! Also - they have restrooms, which is handy to know since the outdoor restrooms become very crowded just prior to the concert.",portergirlbooks
50,Not to be missed,"Whenever friends are visiting LA and ask me what they should do The Hollywood Bowl is at the top of my list. There is a wide variety of events during the season and it should be easy to find something that everyone can agree on. My ideal Bowl night starts with a picnic in one of the areas around the Bowl and then a leisurely stroll over to see the show. Ticket prices run from extremely reasonable to very expensive for box seats, which is something that everyone should do at least once. The one drawback is parking, which can be a nightmare. I would recommend doing a search to see alternatives to parking at the Bowl itself, and picking something that works for you. There is parking at the Hollywood and Highland mall and it's a short walk from there to the Bowl.",JohnLosAngeles_CA
50,A great Los Angeles venue,"Just saw Billy Joel last night to a sold out concert which was fantastic. The bowl has over 17,000 seats so is a small city. A few suggestions to maximize your enjoyment. The bowl allows you to bring in wine only when it is a Bowl event. Outside entertainers also do concerts at the bowl where alcohol is not allowed. Check on line if you can bring in alcohol or you might be chugging a 1st growth burgundy outside the gate. There are lots of food sources available there or bring a picnic dinner. Consider taking a park and ride bus and avoid the traffic. You get dropped at the entry gate and save 30 minutes of traffic leaving.",RL18
30,Great venue..Horrible access,"Once your in the Hollywood Bowl, all is good. Sound system is good and the back drop is amazing. The bad part is getting in and getting out. I would suggest not going unless its an act that you absolutely love because the stress and headache of navigating that place is tough to deal with. Whatever you do, DO NOT park in the Bowl parking areas. Do a ""park and ride"" or shuttle. I took the shuttle from the LA Zoo and it was a good option.The venue itself is great, once your in your seat...the rest of the place, not so much",Dave W
50,The Best Place to See a Concert,"Came from Toronto to see Billy Joel play last weekend. What an amazing venue. The sound was incredible. We were way back in the 'M' section and still had a great view of the stage. It felt like an intimate show despite the thousands of people present.If you go for a concert, think of arriving early and having a picnic - people were enjoying wine and upscale picnic fare before the show. Looked incredibly civilized. While you can't bring in alcohol or opened water bottles, they will allow you sealed water bottles (they remove the caps at security) and you can bring in your own food.As for Parking, it's actually cheap for event parking. The lots just outside the bowl charge around $22.00 - parking is stacked, so you won't be able to leave early, but despite a capacity crowd, the lots were pretty much empty 45 minutes after the concert. Unstacked parking is available further away - costs vary from $25 - $40.Hollywood Bowl is worth a visit even if you don't have tickets to a show - the view is spectacular.",Nicole D
30,Small museum,"The Hollywood Bowl is an awesome outdoor concert venue, but the museum is small. If you go to the Hollywood Bowl to take a tour, check out the museum. However, I wouldn't go just to see the Hollywood Bowl museum. Although interesting, there isn't much to see. If you are an LA history buff, you will love it!",Jerry Crawford
50,Hollywood Bowl Venue,I've been here four years in a row for the Korean Music Festival. It's a really great venue. The small walk up to the seats is quick and the whole place is very well taken care of. I appreciated that this year they took the time to replace the bench seating which is comfortable for 4 hour or so long concert. I'd bring your own cushion if you don't think it will be that comfortable. You can also rent them if necessary.Vending staff is always friendly and things are within reasonable pricing. All I did this year was ask for a cup of ice for my bottle I was already using. I appreciate that they let you bring in your own water bottles. The stage lighting and sound system were also updated from last year when I visited which made it a big difference. Beautiful venue and can't wait to visit it again.,emowk
50,Black Sabbath back at the Bowl!!,"We had already booked a week in Santa Monica from the UK when Black Sabbath announced this concert at the Hollywood Bowl - their first at the venue since 1972. Not a chance to be missed to tickets booked.Parking at the Bowl had some bad reviews including high prices and stacked parking - and on the evening it did look like a bit of a mess - so we parked at the Hollywood and Highland Center in the afternoon, took in Hollywood itself, and walked up the Bowl.The walk is about 15 mins up a slight incline which was fine but be prepared to be inundated by fake merchandise seller and scalpers.Once inside the official merchandise tents were very busy but relatively quick.We had seats in the top level and getting to these was the only real problem of the evening. There are escalators going up the levels which is great but on each level, the beer lines were crossing straight across the route to the next level which meant there was a lot of pushing and shoving to get through. There were a few staff there but not enough to organise the beer queues.Toilets are liberally scattered throughout the venue and kept pretty clean considering the amount of people (and amount of beer drunk).The seats at the back are just benches but the legroom is good (I'm 6'4"") and for a rick concert you don't spend too much time sitting.Black Sabbath were awesome - we saw them in London O2 in December and are seeing them again in London at Hyde Park in July - and despite being close to the back, the sound in the Bowl was very good. The video screens were clear and bright and the firework display at the end spectacular. All with a view of the Hollywood Sign in the background.A great evening and one not to be forgotton.",Jon W
50,"If you're music fan, you must stop here!","The Hollywood Bowl is such an awesome arena for live music. I just wish we could have seen a concert here. I can only imagine what the acoustics sound like. Walk around the grounds, walk up the steps and into the seating area, and check out the museum on-site.",LizGage
50,Do it!,"This summer, there are approximately 9 separate days that were must sees for me and about 5 others that I was interested in. Great for townies and visitors alike. Parking is horrible because the congestion afterwards is a pain (park down in L.A (we use the VFW for $15.00) and walk up. They also have shuttles. Bring food (Picnic in the Park) as it really adds to the experience. Lots of big names perform here from all genres because the feel is so nice. From Looney Tunes to Yuja Wang to Placido Domingo and Dudamel, it's a true pleasure. They also have fireworks AND tickets are really cheap, even if you want to go into the boxed seating. Love the Bowl.",JESSICA L

50,Excellent acoustics and experience,"We saw Tchaikovskys 1812 Overture here and it was just amazing. Even though we had seats further in the back it was still an amazing experience. The parking is well organized and despite it was a big event we got a parking space not too far away. You gotta be there early enough, though, of course because since so many people fit in there it takes a while to get in there. Besides the acoustics the ambiente is also really great and you got the feeling that not the event was adapted into the superbowl but the superbowl just just added perfectly it's flair to the event. The friends who went together with us also were pretty stunned and we left very satisfied from an event we'll be sure to remember.",Michael W
50,Best Venue Ever!!,The date is wrong because we went there years ago on our best date ever. Tony Bennett was the entertainment. You can take in your own wine and beer and we had our own wine glasses (klink) It was the date of our lives which we will never forget. We stayed at a hotel within walking distance.,energizeranimal
40,Amazing Concerts,"I feel affection for the Hollywood Bowl. It's such a good-looking outside site so as to can be take pleasure in on or after any chair. Parking is, of route, a harass. If you employ their usual parking, its heap and will consequently get you everlastingly to obtain absent. I more often than not park additional downwards on Highland and just saunter up the mount. Mainly freshly I took the metro; it was expedient on the method readily available, but took method also extended on the method rear because every coach only sprints each 30 notes (and we now missed ours). An additional option would be to receive the ferry. I haven't tried it other than it seems to be beautiful suitable.",Bernadette H
30,Fun Night with Average Food,The food is hardly the attraction but on a nice warm night with the sounds of beautiful music you will hardly notice!,Ellen F
40,A one time experience unless money is no object,"I have been to the Hollywood Bowl maybe 4 times in the past 10 yrs. One of the issues for me is the long walk to get into the actual line to get in and then another long walk, mainly uphill to get past the food shops and bathrooms. (the bathrooms are few and far between and at intermission it is way too crowded to make it back in time if you also stop for food. The parking is a challenge and where we sat 3/4 of the way up the concrete blocks of seats they are hard and if you have like an old seat pad to bring, you may find it a great ""boost"". If you aren't sitting up close about 1/3 of the way up from the stage, then you're paying a lot of money to sit and watch a giant tv screen which is still far away. I prefer smaller theatres for plays and musicals where I can actually make out the facial features of the person singing.",385eileenz
50,Most enjoyable LA concert venue,"To me, there's nothing better than a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Concerts here are generally in the summer, with the LA Philharmonic, but other performers are also in concert. Food can either be brought from home or purchased at the Bowl (but expensive). I always bring my food--some people eat before the concert at tables or wherever they can--and eat at my seat, which is allowed. It's fun to eat and listen to the concert at the same time. It can get cool there after dark, however, so outerwear is recommended; also a blanket to put on the seat as the benches are hard (plastic pillows can be rented for $1.00).You needn't buy the most expensive seats since huge screens let you see everything, but I like to sit in the middle of the Bowl. Sound is good everywhere. Take a picnic and enjoy the music with friends!",OCfoodie92648
50,Music under the Stars,"This is a great place to listen to music. Pack a meal, bring your favorite drink, rent a cushion if you are on the benches and enjoy. I recommend taking one of the Hollywood Bowl Shuttles. Check the website for a location near you. Eventhough it might be warm when you get there, make sure you take something to wrap up in because it can get cold when the sun goes down.",QAuntie
50,Inside Access,"Went during off season. Very beautiful grounds. You can tell their maintenance crew love their jobs. Everyone I ran into was Extremely nice. Answered any questions, and always smiling. The seating layout was amazing. Very accessible for those with accessibility issues. They have a crew that will take you almost right to your seats. Beautiful picnic areas, only venue like it that lets you bring in your own food items. Exception to that is their leased events. Anything to do woth Philharmonic Events, bring a picnic and some wine...enjoy.",kaidynsmom
50,Awesome venue,This is a great outdoor venue and very fun to go with a group of friends or family. You can take in your own food and picnic before the show. They used to allow you to take in wine too but I would check to make sure this policy is still effective. It does have to be in a plastic bottle though... no glass allowed.,NilooG
50,Pack a dinner and take the bus...,"Love the atmosphere and concerts under the stars! Pack a picnic dinner and you're set, but be sure to read website for details on cooler sizes, containers, etc. It may be a challenge to get there from across town on a weeknight, so recommend taking the bus from one of their park and ride lots located throughout LA County. It's inexpensive, relaxing, and hassle-free.Once situated, the large screens capture all the action below and the sound quality is amazing! Even from the far reaches of the bench seats, it felt as though James Taylor, Carole King, and Lionel Richie were right there with us. Some concert fans can get a bit enthusiastic, so don't be surprised if you get sprayed by some wine or smell something weird...just enjoy the show!",Shimadog

50,Great place to see the LA Phil,"The bowl is a great place to go on warm summer nights. I live in the San Fernando Valley where it gets really hot in the summer, and on Tuesday night you can find me cooling off and enjoying classical music at the bowl. It is easy to get to the bowl as they run cheap busses to every concert from all over the LA Basin. Take the bus as parking at the bowl ia a pain in the neck. Bring a picnic and enjoy a wonderful evening. Don't forget your jacket. It does get cool here even on those scorching hot days in August. You can go to rehearsals in the morning for free. Great fun.",Hejwall
50,Ahcoustics!,"On a bus tour, we stopped at the Hollywood Bowl, were treated to a recitation of folks and music and celebrities, but the most incredible were the brilliant acoustics.

It was great - the sound in here was incredible and to just sit there and listen to all of the theme to the movies that I watched growing up was great. Plus, being at the Hollywood Bowl was iconic in it's own right. I grew up watching all of the classic movies that filmed here so it's just a great thing to be here.",Melissa1130
50,Don't Miss.,"A lovely place. I last visited in 1976, and obviously there have been changes (notably a pull-down shade at front), but the essence of the place still shines through. We were lucky enough to be present when the L.A. Phil. Was rehearsing, magical, especially as we hadn't tickets for a performance. The setting, in the hills is beautiful. You can see it from above at the mulholland drive scenic outlook.",Cathy B

30,Over hyped. Over crowded,The place was over crowded and hyped. May be it was season. Wasn't quite enjoyable due to rush. Parking costed a bomb compared to vancouver BC :-( . Long line up to park. Will try to visit again in summer.,HILAN_R
50,Wear your walking shoes!,"This is a beautiful setting for seeing a live music performance. We totally enjoyed the setting, the food and the music. The views of the city are amazing, and there is ample opportunity to buy food or drink, or you can of course bring your own. The whole bowl is well maintained, and there are clean, well-appointed restrooms.One word to the wise, however. If you are not fit, this may not be the place for you. You will be walking up many steps and hills to get to your seat, and when the show is over there will be a huge crowd for you to navigate. We highly recommend that you park in a vacility away from the bowl, and walk down to your parking rather than trying to drive in such a crowded situation.That being said, the Hollywood Bowl is something to see, and I would not have missed it on our trip to LA.",Vinopopos
40,A must see spot for tourists while in LA,"We visited the Hollywood Bowl during a 1/2 day City Tour of LA. It is a great attraction to see even if there is no concert on. Just the size of it is tremendous.If you're into music, I would suggest a visit...The acoustics are apparently the best......",Peter D
50,Classic Los Angeles,"I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that as an L.A. native, the first time I attended the Hollywood Bowl was at the advanced age of 29. It was summertime, the Philharmonic was playing selections from Mozart and we sat in the rafters-- well, not QUITE the rafters, but near the rafters. Kindasorta. It didn't matter actually; since that day I've been front row center (nice if you like looking up people's noses); off to one side in the bench seats; Super Seats; the OFFICIAL rafters and the center of the Terrace Boxes. Know what? They were all good seats, just from different perspectives-- and given today's improved sound system plus the dandy addition of screens to bring the action up close and personal-- you can pretty much be assured of a wonderful experience wherever you sit.It's great fun sitting in a box seat, bringing wine and an upscale picnic, eating by candlelight (see the website; there are restrictions here) and feeling very much a part of The Bowl Scene. But, it's also wonderful picnicking in one of the many areas designated for exactly that purpose both within and outside of The Bowl proper. Bring your own meal (the more imaginative, the more fun), enjoy sit down dining or purchase on the grounds from concession stands. You can also order food in advance to be served to your box. Please note that the guidelines I'm giving pertain to Philharmonic events-- if you're going to see a band or another event, you may wish to check The Bowl's website, as I understand there are different guidelines applicable and alcoholic beverages may not be allowed.Once you've passed through the ticket booth on a performance night, you'll find the grounds a hive of activity. The uphill lay of the land can be somewhat challenging for mobility challenged or for a person pushing a wheelchair, however, there are multiple escalators, elevators, moving sidewalks and even an electric cart rental available to make things easier. Listening devices are available for the hearing impaired and there are seat cushions available for those sitting in the bench seat area. Check online or phone for details.Parking at The Bowl can be an expensive enterprise. Depending on the event, location, and size of your vehicle, you may get hit anywhere from a $17.00 to a whopping $45.00 charge, which seems particularly ridiculous if you're sitting in the rafters. Bowl parking is typically stack-parked, so once you're in, you're there for keeps, so if Quick Escape is part of your game plan, you may need to figure out alternate arrangements. There are a number of Park-and-Ride lots throughout the L.A. area allowing you to leave your car and hop a bus to The Bowl (I think it's about $10.00 for the ride.) This may be a less desirable option for folks lugging picnic baskets and refrigerator freezers, since you'll be hauling those around with you all night and there are some restrictions as to the size of items you're allowed into The Bowl. For us, the usual procedure is to arrive very early and picnic at one of the areas adjacent to parking. That enables us to get a decent space and dine at our leisure with all necessary accoutrements, all of which we stash in the car before proceeding to our seats. But, I'm sure there are numerous ways to enjoy the evening which will work well into your particular style.There is something about listening to music in the open air--- particularly on a lovely summer evening, Man-in-the-Moon gazing down upon upon you from on high-- which renders the entire experience magical. You're in the middle of a city, right off a major freeway, for gosh sakes-- but all the distractions vanish inside The Bowl. Even the airplanes are rerouted above, so that it's just you, what's happening on that stage, a few crickets and The Night. Whether it's a classical concert, jazz, pops or a special event-- Fireworks Night or no (and fireworks at The Bowl really should be experienced at least once) an evening at The Bowl is a uniquely L.A. experience not to be missed.",Gail G
50,Best open-air theater in the world!,"This is one of the coolest places to see a concert but watch out for a couple things. Most concerts and shows here have box seats (most are owned by season subscribers). While the venue is amazing, sitting up close would almost always require a visit to Stub Hub rather than Ticketmaster. Of course if you do not mind sitting in the rear 60% of the venue, this does not apply to you. On the upside, the box seats come with service and food for purchase (for a fee). I've sat near Halle Berry and other celebrity subscribers in the past. Great venue!",traveler4k
50,Excellent,I went to the Hollywood Bowl for the first time 2 months ago and I was really impressed! I loved how everyone brought their picnic baskets and were eating before and during the show. Will definitely go again.,Ali250
50,Great Concerts,"Love this place for concerts, great sound and easy to see from all angles. Fun to bring food and have a picnic before concert. Take the bus so you dont have to worry about parking.",Marc Anenberg
50,Amazing venue - Classic Los Angeles,"No better place to take in a concert in LA. Small enough to not be overwhelmed by a large crowd, big enough to attract the best artists, under the stars. Do your homework on how to park or how to get to and from and you will have a wonderful evening.",Ewiley3
50,Great experience,Fabulous jazz venue al fresco. It's even better if you are able to sit in a box. Take food and enjoy the music and the outdoors. It gets cool in the evening so be sure to take a jacket. You can also purchase food at the bowl but it can get a bit expensive. We always take food and cold beverages and then buy hot drinks in the evening,ibaol
50,Best place to see a concert,"We are from the northwest and have the great ""Gorge"" to see an outdoor concert, but this place is soooo cooool. Took my kids to see Jason Mraz and they loved everything about it. Beverages are a little pricey, but worth the fun.",Nippercop
50,Fun under the Stars,Was invited by a VP to attend a concert and dinner in a box. What a wonderful treat and experience! The night was perfect and our neighbors in the box next to us were a hoot!,Karen M
50,The best outdoor venue!,There is no better venue to sit and enjoy dinner and a concert. They let us bring our own wine and beer in along with a full dinner we packed. The venue is close to the stage so their is no bad seats. We watch BB King and had the night of our lives.,MoverShakerUSA
50,The BEST LA has to offer,"The Hollywood Bowl on a summer night is one of the best experiences in LA. Get a box, bring or order a picnic, drink some wine and chill to some great music.",Simon M

50,Loved it!,Fabulous place. Really exceptional. Location is great. Staff were very good too! All in all a must Visit place!!,Carol S
50,My favorite theater/concert venue,"I've been to the bowl a few times for concerts and my absolutely favorite, the Sound of Music Sing-a-long. If you're not looking to spend too much money, you can get the cheaper seats towards the back, and your experience will still be just as lovely. Packing a nice picnic is also a huge bonus. The past few times I've opted for the terrace boxes so we have a bit more room to spread out. The garden boxes for the Sound of Music go quickly. Another FYI is that I believe the terrace boxes seat a certain number...like 6. So if you bought 4 tickets, there is a chance that you will be seated with 2 other randoms. It's a small space so sometimes that can be weird if they're not friendly.I know some people prefer to park off-site and shuttle in, but I'm lazy and don't mind the world's largest tandem parking. You wait a bit, but it never seems that bad to me. We make it work. I think you can also park at Hollywood & Highland and walk over. I'm too old to do that now. But those are other options.",keyser_soosie
50,Great place to hear world class sound.,Every seat sounds amazing. Every seat has world-class sound from the best performers in the world. I would try to get a seat towards the middle or back in the grass. It's also a great place to visit during the day. Every seat sounds amazing.

50,"Great night out, unique to So Cal","There is nothing like seeing a concert outside under the stars in a venue built for it!!! It's magical. The only draw back is the parking situation and the dearth of folks who need to get in and get out at the same time. Take my advice, suck it up and go anyway, you'll really enjoy yourself.",daycavtravel
30,A Great Setting Wasted on Trivial Material,"The setting is great, the parking is unspeakable, the material presented is insultingly lowbrow. If you are serious about music, you'll want to skip the Hollywood Bowl. No composer ever meant for jets and helicopters to contribute to his symphonies. There is a decidedly lowbrow influence, as if the managers don't trust the audience to accept culture. My favorite from some years back: Hollywood stuntmen staging a fistfight in front of the orchestra while it played music from Western movies. How dumb do they think we are?",George M
40,"Fun, historic venue","What's not to like? Nestled in nature and seeping in history, it's like glamping in the woods to see your favorite concert. The stage, sound and lighting make it a great if not cozy atmosphere.You can bring your own food and booze, eat at one of the higher elevation picnic tables amongst old pine trees.Quirky, cool and a must do in Los Angeles.",jahdelrey

50,Best place to see a concert in LA.,"The Hollywood Bowl has so much history that you can feel the awe of the greats that have played there. Not a bad seat in the house and just a marvelous venue to see any type of music. I've seen the LA Philharmonic there a few times and it's great because they let you bring your own wine, food and virtually anything else! We make a humongous picnic and just chow down while enjoying the music. They also have lots of historical facts all around the Bowl so you can really understand how important the a legacy it has. I love it.And remember: I guarantee EVERYTHING I recommend. ;)",peewilly
50,What a view,"One of the best spots to see a live performance on stage. I saw John Williams perform at night and the show was incredible. You can bring your own food and drinks, so it makes the perfect date night!",Jacob
50,Great for concerts,"I've seen many a show at the Hollywood Bowl. The parking can get crazy, so it's best to find a $10 parking lot on the blocks below the actual bowl.",Summer H
50,Would love to see more concerts here,"got to see 2 concerts here and loved it. Outdoors, but close to the city. Great place to see a concert, intimate but not cramped. would recommend seeing a concert here.",wegoplaces4589
50,Must do while in LA,"Had a great night at the Tchaikovsky Spectacular in August 2013 (and I'm not particularly a fan of classical music). This is an amazing outdoor venue, a wonderful, unique place to have snack and listen to music in summer. Don't take in an DSLR camera though, that won't work. And I recommend taking a taxi.",speake53
40,take the shuttle!,"The parking lots are pure madness. All tandem parking means when you get to leave depends on your neighbors. At $6, the shuttles are an AWESOME deal. As for the shows, the box seats are amazing. You can order meals and wine, or bring your own. The bench seats are a little more rowdy, depending on the show, but still a ton of fun. In either case, bring a seat cushion for better comfort, and even a blanket for the cooler nights. Being able to drink wine out in the open is a bonus. And let me just say the women's bathrooms are AMAZING!! There is NEVER a line, as they are vast and numerous!",808stays
50,Free Perfect picnic site,I have not been to a concert here in many years. We revisited site just to look around in the middle of the day. Our picnic lunch was enjoyable at this venue. Nice place to get-away from traffic and hustle bustle of LA.,Lascassaslass
40,Excellent Price for Far Away Seats,"If you want to attend a concert for a reasonable price, then sit in the back, enjoy the sound as you won't be seeing much but I'm not one who needs box seats to enjoy the show. Do bring a blanket or cushion as the concrete is a bit hard on the bottom.",Tammie_McD
50,Hollywood Bowl,"If you get a chance to visit the bowl please do so, you can take a picnic up there and enjoy your food before the concert. If the weather is permitting it will be a wonderful night of music.",njcrocker
50,Simply the best concert venue!,"The Hollywood Bowl provides the best possible conditions to enjoy any artist, be classic music or modern.

50,Spectacular!!,"We went there to see Jason Aldean Oct 19th, 2013. This place is amazing! The view from inside is fantastic!! The only problem we had was catching a cab back to our hotel after the concert. Thank goodness the police were there to hail us a cab or we would have been there all night. Be prepared if you have never been before, it can be a headache getting out of there.",chrisbishtx45

40,Lionel Richie and dinner = One FABULOUS evening,"Always a pleasure to enjoy an evening under the stars at the Bowl. Saw Lionel Richie...fabulous concert and decided to enjoy the Wine bar. Walked in without reservations and sat at the Bar. Our wonderful bar attendant was Signe. Great view, very clean, great music and very relaxing and prices very reasonable. She was so attentive, friendly and boy is she organized. She had a full bar and was able to take care of us as though we were her only customers. Our Champagne was great, the service impeccable, the server was worth a million and we'll be back. I normally have drink and dinner before we arrive but this time I was very glad we went to the wine bar. Although they had a restaurant there as well, the wine bar serves food and, it looked fantastic.....I must say the couple next to us practically inhaled their food so it was obviously as good as it looked. We'll have dinner and wine at the wine bar when we visit next time. Thanks again to Signe for setting the evening up to be truly unforgettable.",Mitchall M
50,Great Outdoor Concert Venue,Loved the Jason Aldean Concert. Beautiful evening. I would never try to park at this venue. Way to many people. Stayed at Loews less then 1/2 mile and walked over. Chose tickets close to the end of an isle and didn't have to deal with crowds. Easy in and out. Very close to restrooms. Beautiful evening. Jake Owen was great. Love the outside sound so much better then inside. Can't wait to go back!,jaknix
40,Part of our bus tour - great,"Being fans of Neil Diamonds 'Hot August Night ' we were very pleased to have had this included in our bus tour of LA. Its only a small place and looks much different to what you see on the TV was what I first noticed and couldn't imagine big artists playing here, but they do. If you are interested in this type of thing, then by all means don't miss it",Ozziechick45
40,Great outdoor concert experience,First time to the venue. We decided to get there very early when the parking opened (4:30PM) and it was worth it to us. We got a great parking spot and were one of the first cars out. The gates opened at 5:30 for entry to the grounds and we went straight to the Wine Bar restaurant and had a wonderful dinner and relaxing time before the concert started (7PM). Prices were reasonable for this venue we thought and the tapas and full plate menu had excellent choices for our taste. The Lionel Richie concert was wonderful.,dps_Sedona
30,Great concert,Beautiful concert under the stars. Jason Aldean and Jake Owen rocked the stage. The parking is rediculous. You would think with this big of venue the parking would be so much better. There should be more shuttle opportunities. The lack of handicap parking is a disgrace to the diabled people and the people who answers the phone at department 12 are uncaring. There needs to be crowd control with people who drink to much. Food and beverages way over priced.,Brenda P
50,Lovely concerts under the stars,"I love the casual outdoor concerts in all genre - classic, jazz, pop - under the stars. We bring our sandwiches and wine and enjoy the concerts. My favorite is the movie theme concert. The parking is crazy and when you get in, there's no way to get out early before other cars in front of you start moving and clearing. When we go, we use a close by park and shuttle place. When you sign up online, they send you the schedule and you have option to buy multiple concerts in advance. When you get cheaper tickets, bring a little cushion so you can seat comfortably for a couple hours. Opening and closing of the season, they also have fireworks at the end of the concert.",WandererSun
50,Attended a Jazz festival a few summers ago...,I went with a group of people to the summer Jazz festival. We sat far back but it was enjoyable nonetheless.,Dr W
50,Great place,Saw Lionel Richie this weekend. First timer to the bowl....was impressed and will be back. Great outdoor venue and sound was great.,JerrySpigma
50,Relaxing Experience,"Having been from Los Angeles, and having a father who was a music critic, I have had many, many occasions to attend concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, whether it be pop or classical. I can't say enough about what a wonderful experience it is! H.B. is a huge, outdoor stadium that offers a variety of events. Come early, bring a picnic and enjoy your relaxing meal under the stars! You can rent a small table that fits in your box seat, and spread out the food. For those who do not have box seats, there are plenty of picnic tables, and you can enjoy a relaxing meal before the concert. For a fee, there is a lot of parking for the huge crowd, so no worrries. I can't tell you enough what a great time you'll have at the Hollywood Bowl. Go once, and you'll be hooked on the experience!",birdie57
50,A great way to experience some culture,When i discovered our hotel was within walking distance I was even more delighted to find the LA Philharmonic were playing their summer season when we were there. We bought super cheap tix to the benches area at the back. We brought supermarket salads with us for a picnic and settled in.It was just amazing to listen to the music in such an iconic arena. Loved every minute.,Amandaandian
50,Impressive venue,Impressive tour of the Bowl. Tour took about 10 minutes. A bit off the beaten path but well worth the time.,Agingwell711
50,Get here if you can,"Seeing a show at the Hollywood Bowl is a must at least once. It's an awesome venue and they have a variety of shows each season. I've been to five July 4th concerts, the Sound of Music Sing-Along and numerous other rock & classical concerts. Most recently we saw Tony Bennett. It's customary to bring a picnic and either eat in your seats or at one of the MANY picnic areas inside the bowl. You get a beautiful view of the Hollywood Hills at the upper picnic areas.Parking is difficult but there are shuttles throughout L.A. and the valley where you can park and ride for $5 round trip.",musclegirl68
50,Great Venue,I have been to this venue for a number of different shows. This is by far my favorite outdoor venue.,Jae L
50,Love the Bowl!,Julie Andrews was the best and it's the best venue to see her! You can bring your own food and drink and you're outside. The venue is so pretty up against a mountain and it's amongst all these beautiful trees. I'd recommend bringing your own cushion to sit on. You'll love it!,1travelover
50,Outdoor music magic arena- picnic style,Love the bowl ! Have been there many times. This time was for the Sound of Music sing-a-long. We brought wine and cheese and a blanket. Great fun. Great people watching. So many people dress up like the characters shown in the movie on the huge screen. The vibe is infectious; everyone is so friendly and orderly. Can't wait to go back and see Grease.,Kathy S
50,Best Venue Ever,Best concert venue I have been to and Ive been to a lot. We came here for Vampire Weekend. The show was spectacular. Brilliant concert. The lighting and the sound were perfect. The bowl was very clean and tidy. The staff and security were very nice. I really like the idea of bringing your own food and drink into the venue as that is something that you can't do here in Ireland.,Davidmc5585
40,Earth. Wind and fire concert,"The Hollywood bowl was the venue for the Earth, Wind and Fire concert which was a spectacular show. The setting was beautiful and well coordinated staff was clearly evident. Just don't have the picnic as it was rather disappointing . Needles to say the concert itself was amazing. Plenty of room to dance , if you wanted to, and the sound is tremendous.",Sandy F
50,My favorite outdoor venue!!,"Just saw Maroon 5 at the Bowl this past week, and saw Kristin Chenoweth with the LA Phil a few months ago. The sound is fantastic, and the venue is beautiful. I love seeing the lights around the different shells change color throughout each show. This is the ultimate venue to see a concert. If you are lucky they will have fireworks at the end of the show, which is always a treat.They encourage bringing a picnic before the performance. You can eat right in your seats, or in one of the many picnic spots around the venue. Get there early to secure a nice spot for your picnic because they go fast. You can usually bring beer and wine for LA Phil concerts, but they are typically not allowed for leased events.Be aware that parking is extremely limited and inconvenient. My suggestion is to take one of the many shuttles from the several park and rides around the L.A. area. I usually park at the Hollywood and Highland Mall and take the shuttle from there.",Jeremy P
50,The best music venue in LA!,Saw Kelly Clarkson & Maroon 5 on Oct 6th. Wowowowow!!! Great show. Been to the Bowl many times. Never disappoints.Take the shuttle bus to the Bowl. DON'T drive. Parking is a nightmare. But the bus is a breeze. Bring your meal (no liquor) or pick up something there (incl. liquor).There were (unexpectedly) fireworks at the end of the show. Spectacular!!,Ana C
50,Best way to spend an evening in Los Angeles,"I love going to ""the Bowl"". We get a 4 concert series each summer. Our tickets have included everything from The Blue Man Group, to Hair Spray, to Pink Martini, to Opera. Always accompanied by the orchestra who are wonderful! We usually order dinner from Patina to be served in the box as it makes the evening more relaxing for us, but we have had many lovely picnic dinners as well! We try to get there early enough to spend 90 minutes or so with our guests before the show starts and especially enjoy when the temperatures are moderate and the sun heats the boxes. The service there is generally hard to beat. There is always someone to set up or break down your tables and haul away your trash. Need a bottle of wine opened, or some ice........there is someone able to do that too. I always get chills as the show starts with the orchestra playing The National Anthem. We have coffee and dessert during intermission and love it when the show finishes with fireworks. The conductors Wilkins and ""the Dude"" are personable and make the show rather intimate. As one of our best friends said, ""It is the most civilized thing you can do in L.A.!""",Shelly Z
50,A magical place to see a concert,"My friend took me here to see a classical music concert for my birthday, we had a table with dinner for two and wine, and the stage was beautiful. It was all lit up and the accoustics were amazing. The lights were a soft pastel and changed gently with the music, the crescendo was a whirlwind of fireworks! What a night...",DeirdreLamb
40,Lovely place to just walk around and take in the atmosphere,"We went when there wasnt a concert on and we were allowed to walk around the museum and the Bowl itself (not the stage though obviously!) unsupervised and without a fee either...It is set in lovely grounds that you can walk around (there is a map of walks around the area you can get) and it was just really peaceful place set in a really manic, crazy town! Loved the history and you can just about see the Hollywood sign from the Bowl too!",KIRSTYRAW
40,Fireworks,"Such a great concert venue, I finally got to go the day before July 4th for the fireworks special show. But Josh Groban was a bore, the orchestra was great, I would have preferred just have them perform the entire time instead.Parked at a nearby lot to avoid the stacked parking nightmare. Didn't mind the few blocks there and back. But had to view dirty Hollywood and that was a turn off.",Linnea P

50,Lovely...,"I wanted to write a review in case out of towners wonder if they should go. Yes. Go. It is an iconic venue, when the weather is perfect, as it was that night, there isn't a place that can beat it. We could see the Hollywood sign which adds to the ambiance. Their sound system is really exceptional. Just makes a perfect evening. The parking? Well is sucks. It is $23 and a total cluster when we left. Helpful tip, if you are in a hurry to get out, find an alternative place to park. Where I don't know. :) Their food is excellent, all kinds of great items and places to eat there, which I didn't know, so I was happy we got there early to hang out. We even got flavored popcorn. Best thing, if you are in the bench seats, rent a seat cushion for a dollar. Three inches of padded bliss. Also their staff is really awesome. Every person I encountered was more than nice. Yay Hollywood Bowl!",TravelerCharlotte
50,One of my favorite LA spots!,Your experience can be wonderful at the Hollywood Bowl if you plan ahead a little. Be sure to pack a luxurious picnic dinner with some wine to enjoy with the performance. Don't forget to take a light jacket or blanket for the cool nights. A beautiful way to enjoy a night in Los Angeles!,jaguilar323
40,Great acoustics for being outdoors,"I was surprised, I thought this place would be a gathering place for hippies, being that it's outside and all. I resisted going here for years, until my friend surprised me with a concert, not telling me what he was up to or where we were going to go. I dressed up too much, however, no one thought it was strange, so go ahead and wear whatever, relax, have a good time, and enjoy the outdoor concert.",MitsoukoRussie

30,Not very good experience but probably a fluke,"My brother and I went to see Dudamel and made our first mistake by sitting near the back (cheaper tickets). We could hear the music but were surrounded by talking people. In addition, the bowl was having horrible technical difficulties. The English translation showed up intermittently. I have heard lots of good things about this place so my experience was probably an anomaly.",Matt J
40,What a lovely evening...,"The weather was perfectly chilly, the night was clear, and the air was filled with gorgeous music courtesy of the LA Phil. This was my first time here, and I'm so glad I opted for my wedges over the stilettos I'd originally planned to wear! I had no idea that getting to my seat would require so much up-hill walking - I would have worn more sensible shoes. Other than that, the venue and event were just stunning. I enjoyed the company in a box dead center of the stage. It really was magical.Advice: wear sensible shoes!",M_in_The_Woodlands
50,"Had a great time seeing Earth, Wind & Fire!","It was our first time to the Hollywood Bowl. We were a little nervous due to the level of traffic we have seen around here on Bowl nights.A friend told us to park at the LA Zoo and take the inexpensive shuttle bus. Boy, were we glad we did. No reservations required, free parking, $5 roundtrip fare and NO WAITING! It was great! The ride, itself, only took 10-15 minutes and NO TRAFFIC issues!The concert was fantastic and the fireworks a wonderful treat.The venue itself is in such a unique location. You really feel transported to another world.Lots of places to get food (although pricey), and of course the option to bring in your own everything.Would highly recommend this to anyone",KSG123
40,"If you visit LA this is a ""must-see""","If you happen to be in LA at Summer (or at the beginning of Fall) I highly recommend that you pay a visit at the Hollywood Bowl. The ticket price won't be an issue: the more distance seats from the stage are very cheap, but notwithstanding the distance you will enjoy the show. I think that the seats in the back are the best ones: you can enjoy the show and at the same time you can have a nice picnic with your friends. Oh, didn't I mention that you can eat at the Hollywood Bowl? Sure, you can! And I think it is mandatory that you bring something with you if you want to really experience a night at the Hollywood Bowl!",DanieleMO77

Kristen sang beautifully and also injected humor in her show. save yourself aggravation by taking public transportation or buses as the parking is very tight and cars parked bumper to bumper.

50,A classic,"Having a picnic dinner and a bottle of wine at the Hollywood Bowl is one of the best ways to spend a warm summer evening in Southern California. On our latest trip to the Bowl, the orchestra played along with clips from Oscar winning movies projected on high definition screens. It was excellent. Whether it's classical, jazz or movie music the people behind the bowl know how to put on a great show.",gymsname

40,A Hollywood Outdoor Classic - Updated w a Varied Offering,"We have seen lots of concerts here. It's located just minutes from Hollywood center and is a great place to go on a summer evening. If possible, park away from the Bowl in a lot that has ""no stack"" parking. There are places south of the bowl to do that. It will mean a ten minute walk to the Bowl but that will be better than parking at the Bowl where they stack - meaning, someone will park just behind and just in front of you and you will have to wait for everyone to leave before you can move! Do not let this deter you from going! It's a lovely place to see an outdoor concert and you can even splurge and reserve a table down front and bring your own picnic dinner! Otherwise, from pretty much everywhere the seating is good and there are all sorts of prices available. The acoustics are good and it's just very pretty and very deco looking. There are all sorts of places serving different kinds of things to eat. You can also bring your picnic basket to seats outside the ""tables"" area, though it might be less comfortable to bring too much with just your lap to hopld it. A must do at least for one concert of your liking!",thewindatourfeet
40,Mozart & Beethoven by LA Philharmonic,"- great venue, great sound system, but loud crickets distracting especially when a symphony is playing. The last time we were there for a Blues Concert we didn't hear the crickets. We were at the Garden level box seats. I didn't like it there because it was very tight with 4 persons to a cubicle which works fine if you are all friends. With strangers it can get uncomfortable and intrusive.Tonight, Nathan Cole on the Violin and Carrie Dennis on the Viola were outstanding together, performing Mozart.They must have recently upgraded the rest-rooms by the Sushi concession stand. It is bright and clean with so many stalls! What a relief!Note: Scalpers at the gate was trying to fleece us for $40 per ticket.We went to the box office and got $10 Student ticket with ID.Senior citizens are also $10. But you will be sitting on the bleachers.Just bring your own cushions.Parking is a nightmare still though.We parked across the freeway near the Ford Theatre and walked.",3Kells
50,Amazing Venue,Pick your music style and there is a summer concert to suit your taste at the Hollywood Bowl. Pack a picnic and grab a bus local to home to avoid traffic and parking hassles. AND if you select one of their Firework Spectaculars . . .you will see some spectacular fireworks. Two of my favorite concerts are Opening Night and the 4th of July.,MsLBL
30,"Great Venue,but Nothing New","What can I say? The Hollywood Bowl is an icon. After going to performance there for over 30 years, though, I'm looking for something new on the weekends. Unfortunately, their Friday/Saturday concerts have been rerun so many times that many of us long-time subscribers have given up. If you've never been there before, it should definitely be on your bucket list. Just don't expect them to provide much in the way of new entertainment. Year after year, they offer a John Williams night (yawn) and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture (great for the first 5 times you see it). Then they fill the rest of their summer season with eclectic unprofessional acts. How sad to see it go downhill...",SoCalGal100
50,music under the stars,"Do not drive to the venue. Find a shuttle (online) get a ticket and you will not have to worry about parking and sitting in traffic at the close of the performance. I have only bought ""cheap seats"" and the music is still great. Okay to bring food or you can buy it there. Cushions are rented for a dollar or two. There is a LOT of walking even with the escalators and elevators. I do not have information on handicapped access.",Chris T
50,Always an adventure,"I don't go often but when I do it is an event and I get a box. I love being under the stars listening to music. I always forget until I get there the the acoustics are not so great. But, I will continue to go every now and then because it is a fun and very LA thing to do",lillywillis
40,A great bucket-list experience for music lovers.,"Listening to live music, under the stars, in an informal and fun venue is a memorable experience. You can bring your own picnic, or purchase food there - which is pretty spendy. The recently added movie screen detracts from the architectural beauty of the structure, which is unfortunate - however, the videos played during several of the pieces added to the enjoyment for adults and children. It would be nice if they would play the videos on the screes that are along side of the stucture, and not use the large screen that now hangs in the middle. If you're visiting Los Angeles - check to see what events are scheduled during your time there - if you are local to the area, this is a wonderful gift in your back yard - enjoy it often!Other tips - this is pretty challenging for folks with mobility issues - steep hills to walk up, and bench seating which is not very comfortable without a cushion.",Doxiemo
50,Try and attend an concert,The atmosphere is great. The music sounds incredible. Very enjoyable. Seats were all good. Nothing better than great music under the stars,RT88394
20,Loved the performance hated the seat!,I visited the Hollywood Bowl recently and saw Aida sung on stage. The performance was excellent but I do not think I will suffer those benches again. This was a very popular event and there were no better seats available so we took a chance and gave it a try. Suffice it to say three hours on those benches was too much for me!I loved the music but I can't face the benches again!,P8483TCalanr
30,Needs an upgrade,"The bowl is a beautiful place but it needs to be updated. The seats are hard and uncomfortable. The access is very cramped. The entertainment is great, the L.A. Phil is always great. The concessions are very expensive. But everyone should go to the Bowl at least once.",Louis015
50,John Williams Maestro of the Movies,"Spent a warm evening outdoors watching the Maestro and the LA philharmonic orchestra.Great venue, amazing music, great audience,",AARDVARKKILLER
30,Hollywood Bowl a Must See - Bring Walking Shoes,"This is a classic venue and everyone must see once.That being said bring your walking shoes, we went on a sticky hot night and was miserable. We sat next to very large individuals and due to the bench seating I got half a seat and I am not a petite person.The show was wonderful the LA Philharmonic with John Williams and Julie Andrews narrated.We brought a picnic dinner and ate at one of the picnic areas. It was a great way to decompress from the drive and relax before showtime.I don't know if I would go back to the venue, but if there was a band that I really wanted to see .... maybe yes.Park and Ride - the verdict is still out.",Deana S
50,Don't miss if a concert is on,"A must do if there is a concert on during your stay; its a unique setting with a surprisingly good sound for an outdoor venue. We saw the LA philharmonic perform some of Mendelssohn's work. We had central 'superseats' for what I thought was a good value ($50) purchased on the evening of the concert from the box office. However, there are prices to suit all budgets (including dining tables next to the stage - the 'nosh pit'!). Take a picnic or dine there, you won't regret it.",Andrew_W12345
40,Chicago,"It is awesome to see a production here that begins in the twilight light and ends in the full blown darkness. I went during the summer to see Chicago directed by Brooke Shields. It was clearly a fun show but I purchased tickets in the W section which was still kind of far away, even to see the big screens. It was cold by intermission so I recommend bringing something warm. Bring your own food! Because you can!",autumnpoem
40,Good place for a concert,"We've been to the Hollywood Bowl on several occasions, including the recent Goat Rodeo Sessions (Yo Yo Ma, Chris Thile, et al). We love the venue and the variety of concerts. It is easy to find something to like performed by outstanding musicians.The venue is family friendly. We enjoy seeing the variety of ways people picnic before the concert with everything from gourmet meals to simple sandwiches. We find most people well behaved during the concert, although there is always one or two people that feel they have to talk loudly over the music. The weather is typically nice, which adds to the ambiance. The wooden bench seats are uncomfortable, so rent a cushion for $1 or bring your own.The one major downside is the traffic getting there and the PARKING! All lots are stacked park and you can be stuck for some time after a concert waiting for a single car owner to arrive and move their car so that others can get out. Police directing traffic give preference to cars going certain directions when leaving, so if you are in the ""wrong"" parking area you will also sit for a long time waiting to get out onto the main streets. Traffic and parking in Los Angeles are always a consideration for every venue. Basically one just has to accept it in order to enjoy great concerts in lovely settings.",MethosAdventures
50,Every evening is great...,"Whether is it classical music or a concert, nothing beats an evening under the stars at the Hollywood Bowl. Try to have dinner first at the Rooftop Grill. Must call for reservations.",awinrm
50,Highlight of my recent visit to USA,"I purchased tickets in the UK to go and see Diana Ross at the Hollywood Bowl. What a wonderful venue. We had seats in row N and despite my concerns about being sat on a bench for hours, it was very comfy and we had a great view. It was an easy walk from the Magic Castle hotel, and no problems with getting out afterwards. Miss Ross herself was just fab and at 69 still can belt out all the old favourites. Would definitely recommend this as a venue especially if you can get tickets for an artist you love like we did.",Helen_2472013
50,A real 'super bowl',"If you're in the Hollywood area this is a must see with or without a concert. It has the grandeur of Radio City, only outdoors, with it's rich history and retro charm.",kejs
30,Good visit and excellent way to pass some time,"My wife and I visited this place on a Tuesday afternoon prior to driving to San Francisco.You can visit the whole area and walk through the stadium. It is quite impressive.There is a museum that is free with audio sound tracts and the history of the place along with famous people who have played there. This is a nice area to take some pictures as well. Its a good way to spend about an hour or so. You will not be able to make this a whole day event, unless you're here for a concert.If you have never been here before, definitely drop by. It is time well spent.",sia_simba
50,Super venue,Love the Hollywood Bowl! It's a fantastic place to bring food and enjoy a concert. Not too large of crowds and has a very nice feel. Concerts sound amazing!,Christina F
50,The Hollywood Bowl is the best venue in the country.,"How about an outdoor amphitheater (the largest in the US) where you can bring your own wine and food, and sit beneath the stars on a warm summer night listening to the cutting edge sound system and watching the well-produced video screens bringing you right onto the stage. Have been to over 30 shows there and they keep getting better. Did I mention you can walk in there with a bottle of wine in your hand and picnic anywhere on the premises? They also have luxurious box seats with waiter service, excellent food and wine, and a close up view of the stage (occasionally the performers will walk down among the boxes)! No matter where you sit or who you see, this is bound to be an unforgettable night of music and a Los Angeles experience unparalleled anywhere else in the world.",Greg S
50,Great to visit,"Went in the daytime when empty, great view of the Hollywood sign and museum free, great for nostalgia.",MaxiReg
50,Not to miss in Los Angeles,"Catch anything you can here. If you can afford to, spring for the box seats, do it! So worth it. Get up close. Bring a picnic or order food ahead. All good! Bring a blanket to snuggle up in after dark. It tends to get a bit chilly in the bowl after dark.",Amanda A
20,Not really a fan of this place,"This was our second time at the Hollywood Bowl to see Phish. A few years ago, and then this year again. Where do I start with my displeasure? walking the hills EEK. You are always walking up a hill.steep hills. The crowd is really lame. They are so busy looking at / touching thier phones or talking or annoying me by talking to me during the music they hardly pay attention to the show. The first time our seats were way far up and the sound was kind of bad coming up the bowl.This year we had terrace seats and we were treated to table service and a waiter and only had to share our box with these two guys. That was cool. plenty of room to dance. You can bring in a picnic which is also cool and wierd at the same time, as our box mates had this oniony sandwich thing from home which was kind of gross smelling. HOWEVER much improved sound there , great view and the lights were great on the bowl itself. we bought a $65 bottle of what should have been $15 wine that got dumped into a giant plastic cup by our waiter and were allowed to drink warm $14 Heinekens! awesome, how lucky we are . My general line of thought is I wont go back for a third round . Although the band did break through with that earth shattering Hood this year . I guess everyone should go see HB once as it is a historic venue I suppose.dang . It was just a shock coming off a very hot run with great venues & crowds... gorge , tahoe, bill graham. culture shock for sure for me.",TeriS372
40,Beautiful Evening - a classic L.A. experience,Pack a picnic or buy food at the venue. Lovely spot to unwind after braving the hassle of getting there. Fireworks are a lot of fun. The Bowl is a L.A. tradition - visit at least a couple times each summer.,janejets0n
50,Plan your trip around this venue,"If you are going to L.A. during the summer, don't miss the Hollywood bowl. An open venue with a great selection of shows, from the LA Philarmonic with Dudamel as director, to Sound of music sing along. The venue allows you to take your own food and wine, which makes it really special.",MTorre
50,What luck,"We stumbled upon tickets for this and what a great piece of luck. This is such a great venue, open air and terific sound. We have been to many outside concerts before, but nothing quite like this in the center of Los Angeles. If you can find tickets (check hotel) this is a great additional piece to a vacation",karly j
40,Very nice place,Good music with not always perfect acoustics. Noise from close by freeway. Bench seating is often quite crowded. Good places to eat make this a complete evening of enjoyment.,pixer1
50,So cool,I like the tour buss and the street. It was a lot going on there and i recommend everyone to go and se it,Martinius2701
50,Our best LA experience,We went on the 31st July to a concert with Dr John and a host of stars doing Louis Armstrong music. The venue is very special. Historic with good sound in a very relaxed but professional venue.People are laid back and you can take in your own picnic baskets and wine. That wouldn't happen often where I come from. Staff were courteous and the venue was very clean. What a great place to watch the sun go down and soak up the atmosphere.,meatymeaty
50,Great Venue,"On arrival at the Hollywood Bowl for the first time and seeing the crowds, cars, buses, taxis it is amazing that it is organised. So many people in the one location could lead to chaos but the organisation is professional. there is sufficient guides and ushers to make the issue of finding your seat easy. If you are thinking of sitting in the bleachers, which are backed wooden benches carefully consider hiring a cushion, taking a warm jacket and or blanket as it becomes very chilly. A lovely setting in the hills of Hollywood.",Judith C
40,Fleetwood Mac concert,Amazing view and sound! We had great seats so we could see Stevie and Lindsey up close. Great background light show. I love the huge new screens. Bring a bottle and ride the bus.,BONHARV
50,Summertime Must in LA,"My husband and I are frequent goers to Hollywood Bowl. We saw it all from reggae music, folk, classical, world, opera the best musicians in the world are coming each year. If you are in LA make sure you join the large crowds. You can get very cheap tickets and sit far (there are screens everywhere and the acoustic is excellent) or buy one of the boxes and sit like a king and a queen but pay $$$ for it.If you decide to go, I recommend to take the public busses that take you from various part of town to the Bowl, much easier, and faster to get in and out of there. Trying to drive there on your own is a misery in my opinion, take ample time for it.",Tirza_ha
50,Nice experience to watch a concert,"When in Hollywood, make sure to watch a concert in Hollywood bowl. The price is cheap as you go on higher benches but it is still good. Watched concert by myself and i enjoyed it. Closer to my hotel so just walked to and from.",annematt143
50,Just saw Pink Martini there with the Philharmonic,"I absolutely loved my night at the Hollywood Bowl with a friend. This place is magical, tucked within the Hollywood Hills. Go early and take a picnic dinner to eat on the grounds. Bring cushions for comfortable seating on the upper level benches. Parking is stacked, so you will have to wait awhile to leave unless you're lucky enough to be in the front.",Rhonda S
50,The best place for summer concerts,"Get there early (parking gets full soon). Take your own picnic (wine, ham, cheese, sandwich, even pizza) and enjoy one of the best places to listen to good live music. Acoustic is wonderful (just like roman amphitheaters) and you can watch the scenario from wherever you be seated. One tip, take a sweater or a coat, 'cause concerts last until almost midnight and Los Angeles nights are deliciously breezy and cool. Enjoy this place. It's awesome!",Dorarias
30,"worth a stop, just to have a look","We stopped off here for about an hour to have walk round during a coach trip across the States. Told of all the people who have performed here can see Hollywood sign up on the hills. Took some pics, trip was included in with coach tour, so was worth a visit for an hour before we continued on our tour of LA.",gatesy150
30,Whats all the fuss about,"This was purely 'it has to be done' once in a lifetime experience and I have to say I was sensationally unimpressed and was left feeling that I had had a meeting with Dick Turpin. Firstly the taxi ride promised at $40 turned into $65 cos of the damn LA traffic congestion which also made us late for the start of the performance. The performance (all we could get with the limited time in the area) was a Haydn concert with the London Philarmonic Orchestra. First half 38mins !! was nice enough but hey the second half 45mins with 2 large ladies who had really lovely voices DO NOT READ THE SUBTITLES - seriously depressing. The stadium does fill you with a sense of something but im guessing its because I have seen it in so many films and I was looking for all the film stars ,forget it. Take your own picnic beer is $7 a bottle and a very small snack is $13 small bag of kettle crisps $3.75 ouch ouch wish someone had told us. So at $50 a ticket for something way back on the benches you are looking at 60 cents a minute. ENJOY",fred b
40,Beautiful,"Went and saw Andrea Bocelli at the Hollywood Bowl. What a beautiful evening. Very clean nice facility. Only thing I would complain about is when leaving the Hollywood Bowl, there is really not marked way to go so you end up walking through parking lots with people trying to get out. Not very safe.",JustMe123170
40,Great Venue,"The famous Hollywood Bowl was something I'd always wanted to experience and I was not disappointed. It's a beautiful venue with great acoustics. What could be better on a beautiful LA night? The traffic could be crazy, getting in and out of the venue. Fortunately, we did something called Dine and Ride with Yamishiro, a terrific restaurant close by. After dining, they shuttle you to the Bowl and pick you up at the end of the night. It's expensive but well worth it.",NJBrooklynborn
50,Unforgettable Experience,"When in LA and all that Jazz .... we went to see Chicago and had a fabulous night out. I can't imagine how you could fail to be enchanted by the atmosphere and the experience of it all. We parked the car at the Hollywood and Highland centre car park, walked through to the rear of the building to Orange Court and waited for the Hollywood Bowl shuttle bus. First bus at 5.30, plenty of buses running, no pre booking required, pay the driver $5 each. Arrived at dome at 6 ish, no queue to collect our tickets (used Will Call as we booked at home in England months ago), up the stairs to the tabled area and had our picnic - be as lavish as you like here, there were folks with the full tableware, linen, starters through to cheese course. Well, why not?!! Everyone was having a lovely time. We were nearly breathless with excitement on our first view of the auditorium and stage, something we will never forget. We were seated in the middle in the benched seats ($1 for a seat cushion well worth it) and had a good overall view, the screens are of course invaluable to all but those right at the front. The return journey was equally painless. All in all worth every penny.",travelpartners05

40,A landmark outdoor stadium,"The Hollywood Bowl is a great place to visit, especially when they have fireworks like their 4th of July concerts. The outdoor setting is beautiful and there are hundreds of people who picnic at the bowl, bringing all their needed utensils, food and wine with them. It is a bit of a steep walk to the top of the bowl so this will pose a problem for a few people, but I didn't see anyone struggling and the views of the surrounding hills are magical.",baybee63
40,The new sound system is a winner,If you can get tickets try to get a box. Order dinner in advance from the bowl restaurant. Dine and have a bottle of wine and then be enchanted by the music. Very special.,Srklaw7
50,Great Value,"The Hollywood Bowl is one of the best valued attractions in the LA area. We go every year and have rarely been disappointed. Where else can you bring in your own food/drinks and see top notch performers for $7 - $10 for nose bleed seats? Yes, you can spend more for a seat...it's up to you and your preferences. Best way in/out is via their shuttle bus service. The bus picks you up and drops you off at the HB entrance; then picks you up and drops you off at your car...check their web page for information on the various shuttle pick-up sites. If you drive yourself, you are parking in stacked parking lots so plan to sit for a long time until the cars in front and/or next to you clear a space = makes for a really late night.",0001DogzRule
50,One of my favorite venues for live music,"I would attend the Playboy Jazz festival every year here but the crowd became too annoying. Such a shame because it is such a fantastic venue for live music, plays anything. Like anything else, location is key and if you can afford a garden box it's well worth it.They allow picnic baskets and many people pack in smorgasbords along with plenty of wine to boot. Just a fantastic time under the stars on a warm night. Can't be beat!!!",BuLife
40,Parking...a Nightmare,"I love the Hollywood Bowl primarily for its outdoor ambiance. But the restrooms and food options really need an upgrade. What is the worst, however, are the crowds trying to enter and when they exit. Very poor crowd management with a full house. The parking is gridlock. Expect to be blocked in the parking lot and have to wait a long time to get out. My wife and family take a very reasonable, dedicated bus that is chartered and provided at a fair price from remote areas in the suburbs.",ILoveSantahohoho
50,Hollywood Bowl,"This is a most enjoyable place to visit when in Los Angeles. It is a beautiful settingin the hills and outdoors. We like to go early and take our dinner. There are picnic tables available. Sometimes we go without tickets. Most of the time there is something available at the box office. Most of the seating is benches, but you can rent pads to sit on if you need one. Wear comfortable shoes, since there is a lot of walking and some of it is up hill. Take a jacket for the evening. It can get cool.Parking is a bit pricey, but there is not a lot of street parking in the area and if you want to try and park on the street you have to get there very early.",GrandmaDi
50,Awesome!,"This place is awesome and one must go and see for once when in LA. It is an open air concept concert style but I must say if you are listening to the music of the concert, the back and top of the bowl is good enough.

50,Great Music at a Great Price,"Buy tickets for the cheap seats at the top of Bowl. The music is the same. If you're not sitting way up front in the boxes, you're watching the video monitors any way. You can always move down to empty sections. Bring a picnic to eat with friends before the show in the many picnic areas. It's worthwhile to use one the Park and Ride lots and take those special busses to the Bowl.

30,Occasional inconsiderate attendees,I have had several experiences there that have made me select only very special performances for which there is no alternative. On several occasions I have been seated close by attendees who had been drinking and were quite noisy and even rude to the people close by. Most shocking to me was attending a performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony when many concert goers began leaving before the final chorale in order to get to the parking lot before the crowds.,Henry K
40,Great Venue for a Picnic,"i have been going to hollywood bowl forever, growing up in LA. it's a great open space concert venue. bring a picnic basket and enjoy the performances. only part that is challenging is PARKING. usually, you will need to park far (if you don't want to pay too much) then walk for awhile. it's a huge venue, so after concert, it takes forever to leave the site. other than that, it's pretty cool experience if you are visiting LA.",hahnmade
50,Iconic place,"It just doesn't come any more iconic than this. The physical surroundings are so good that they add to any event. To have seen your fav music at the Bowl tops most other experiences.

50,Great place to watch a concert,Went to see Chicago on stage earlier today. This is a great venue for a concert but arriving by car is a no no. Get a cab and it makes things a lot easier.

40,Really informative and free!!,Decided to call in while waiting for a show at the Bowl. It's quite a small museum but full of interesting displays. I wasn't expecting much as it was free but it was a really good way to find out about the history. Definately worth a visit if passing,Travel Man

50,Great Concert Venue!!,"I love Hollywood Bowl, definitely a place to visit, especially if one of your favorite stars performing. Picnic is a great idea, you can buy pretty much all you need right at the bowl",Jose S
50,A thrilling L.A. experience,"This is a uniquely L..A. summertime experience -- not to be missed. Traffic is a nightmare, so we purposely booked a hotel within walking distance. Be sure to pack a picnic; everybody else does.",Bagan
40,"Great Venue, Rough Parking",My wife and I really enjoy going to see concerts at the Hollywood Bowl. The venue is fantastic and the music sounds great. The only problem is the main parking lot is horrible. It is worth the extra money to park a few blocks away at a church or something.,PilotMichael_L
40,must do if there is a concert on,"great open air venue, take a picnic (or in my case two bottles of vino for the mol and 10 cans of beer for me) I would recomend every visiter to LA to come here if there is a concert on, dont matter what it is. just book and go",Bjorn_Toulose
50,"Outstanding Venue, Professional Staff and Fantastic Evenings!","The ""Bowl"" is one of my regular summer haunts. This summer I have tickets to 9 concerts - that is how good their season is. While I love to travel, the Bowl is one of the few things that keeps me in town for summer weekends.The acoustics are perfect, the ability to bring in whatever food and drink you want is great and the staff person that handles our section (Alan) in the garden box area is the best!There really isn't a better way to spend a summer evening than under the stars listening to a concert there. So far I have gone to Josh Groban, Bugs Bunny and Pink Martini. While all the concerts were fun - Pink Martini just outdid themselves this year.On my schedule for the rest of the season is - Chicago the musical, Tony Bennett, Willie Nelson with Lyle Lovett, the Blue Man Group and Earth Wind and Fire. Not a bad summer at all :-)",LA_Travelers_1
50,Wonderful First Visit,"I can't believe it took me so long to attend a concert at the Hollywood Bowl! Sat in Section K-2 for the Pink Martini concert and had a fabulous time. The other attendees were all very friendly and festive. The huge monitors give you a feeling of being closer to the stage. And at $42 a ticket, it was a steal for such a great experience.Suggest you check out the parking alternatives to parking at the Bowl. The website has many alternatives and parking there is difficult getting in and especially getting out. We parked at the Franklin/Hollywood Blvd. parking lot located beneath the mall. There are shuttles that will take you up and back ($5 for shuttle and parking was $13). We found however that we could have walked from the parking structure...it's only a few blocks and with traffic it may be easier to walk. We walked back to the garage after the show.Will definitely be looking at their calendar each spring and planning a few trips!",calpoidog
50,Best Evening Concert Venue in the World!,"We attended another concert at the Hollywood Bowl last night, probably our 400th or so during out lifetime, and, for a change, I sat musing for a few minute (instead of listening tot the beautiful concert, about how lucky we were to have such a wonderful cultural/entertainment asset in the Los Angeles area. The Bowl has been a ""go-to"" choice for 5 generations of Angelinos and visitors, and it just keeps getting better each year. The acoustics are very good for an outdoor concert venue, and the additional sound system has been improved consistently over the years. The various food-purchase options at the Bowl have also been upgraded for the past decade by the Pinot Restaurant Group, and one can now purchase a very creditable meal there (be warned, though, wine bottle purchase is expensive - better to bring in your own bottles and yes, you are allowed to bring in your own bottled wine and beer. Picnic area dotted around the periphery of the Bowl grounds are very welcoming and form a big part of the enjoyment of the Bowl for many visitors. As many other reviewers have noted, there are frequently open rehearsals of the evening program on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the summer. This is a great way to intruduce young children to serious music. In addition, there are children's concerts held in another area of the Bowl at 11:30 AM most days of the week, usually featuring world music, that is, music outside of the usual classical concert material. The Bowl museum is very interesting. All-in-all, a great experience for visitors of all ages.Hint: use the Bowl's very good website or its excellent iphone app for up-to-date info about concerts, ticket availability, transportation, etc.Hint 2: Parking availability is tight, so arrive early and picnic at the Bowl if you are driving, or find out about the many bus routes to the Bowl from area all around the Los Angeles region.",PDEYES
50,Go for a morning rehearsal!,"A newly discovered treat is the Hollywood bowl rehearsals on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 9-12:30. A friend and I took a picnic lunch and sat in the shade enjoying The evening's Elgar cello soloist and the Los Angeles Phil practicing. They are all such professionals that the rehearsal proceeds rather smoothly with very little practiced again. It was an extremely relaxing way to spend the morning. Take binoculars and enjoy the birds flying by, the gentle breezes and most especially, the fabulous music you will hear for free.Parking is also free and readily available.",luvtogo09
50,A perfect place for a picnic,"To have a perfect evening at the bowl, select a box seat, bring in your cheese, bread and wine and whatever else you desire, the box seat is for 4 people so it is even better if you are 4. There was only the 2 of us but it was still great. Get in at 6pm. enjoy the evening , near 8pm the staff will help you remove your picnic table and enjoy the music....and you still can sip your wine in a quiet manner. Do not buy wine at the bowl...way to expensive, do not drive to the bowl...you don't want the traffic headache at the end of the evening, we took a shuttle ride from the LA zoo parking lot $5. return per person. Most of all bring a sweater, nights can be cooled.",joseph b
50,Local concerts by local celebrities.,"We saw Pink Martini and, what a venue! Pack a picnic, get a sitter, and surprise your wife by getting here early and away from your rotten kids (picnic area 7). She deserves a night of pretending she's married to a thoughtful, romantic and sexy man (not you). This is probably the best you can do, man up, get out...show her you don't regret meeting her, because she's the best thing that ever happened to you, you loser.",kloudkckr
50,Life Changing!`,Saw Mumford and Sons and cant believe how amazing this venue is! Take a picnic or get there early and check out one of several great restaurants at the Hollywood Bowl.,hms4uk
30,Great Venue for concerts,"A great place for concerts and picnics are encouraged, especially in the back rows. We went to 80's night and even though we were near the very back, it was still a great experience. It gets pretty dark at night though so definitely bring a flashlight or a fully charged iPhone to see your way along some of the dark sections.",The_Roaming_Raven
50,A Fantastic Experience,"Every time I visit the Hollywood Bowl, I am amazed by the whole experience. It's an incredible venue, in the heart of everything. (Most of these kinds of venues in major cities are a far cry from the city center -- Ravinia in Chicago, Wolf Trap, the Mann Center, Saratoga, Caramoor, etc.) And they've just upgraded the sound and video system, which further enhances the concert experience. That, and the new Wine Bar up the hill from the main entrance, make everything here better than ever.",John M
50,"LA symphony, Josh Groban, fireworks",Who could ask for anything more. You can bring your own snacks. We had a bottle of wine and some fruit. It was a beautiful night and I really cannot say enough about the symphony and Groban's band. The instrumentals were incredible. Really enjoyable evening. Walked to and from the Holiday Inn Express on No. Highland.,Betsetta
50,AMAZING FIREWORKS,"We enjoyed the concert, the fireworks, we also take food and wine for a pic nic with the kids, they enjoyed it as much as the adults.The sound is so,good, there is nothing than enjoyed the music with the orchestra.",IRA_LELI98
50,Beautiful,"1st time when I went there, I was truly amazed. The only thing I can say negative about Hollywood Bowl is their seating. OMG, after sitting there for more than 20 minutes, your butt starts crying for a softer seats. Other then that, it's an amazing place.",hiketilludrop3
30,Josh Groban w/ LA Phil. plus 4th of July Fireworks!,"We enjoyed the venue put forth by Josh Groban and the LA Philharmonic. The show was spectacular. The bench seating was a bit crowded because some people occupy more space than others. Box seating would be a better choice. AVOID driving there. It's a nightmare trying to leave after the concert. We did the park-n-ride shuttle from Westchester and it was a breeze. Wear comfortable shoes because once the concert ends, you have 25 minutes to get back to your shuttle. You will have to rush through the drunken crowd. It's like pushing yourself through a crowd of zombies! Go there and enjoy the music, the wine and cheese! A nice experience to add to your memories.",JewelryBlogStar S
50,Perfect for Summer!,"I love the Hollywood Bowl! It is the best place to be on warm summer nights! My family always goes and we bring picnic lunches to eat while enjoying the performances. And it's even better when you get the seats at the very front of a section (the part right behind the walkways) because then you have a stone table to place all your food!Parking: Parking can be kind of a hassle just because it can take a long time to actually get to the Bowl. I definitely don't recommend parking at any of the Bowl parking lots, it can take FOREVER to exit after a show since you have to wait for every single car in front of you to leave first. Check out this site before you go: http://www.parkme.com/los-angeles-parking/hollywood-bowlYou can find all the Park-and-Ride pickup locations as well as cheap places to park around Hollywood. Just give yourself plenty of time before showtime to park and hop on the bus since traffic around Hollywood is almost always terrible.I definitely recommend going to the Hollywood Bowl at least once in your life, there's very few places where you can see such a great outdoor concert!",Kimberly H
50,4th of July,It was a wonderful experience. Josh Groban put on a great show and the the fire works were awesome. First time at the bowl. Bus from Sherman Oaks to Hollywood Bowl is the only way to go. Our family brought picnic and drinks. Lovely summer night at the Bowl.,ccardnut
40,Amazing Venue...Use Park-n-Ride,"I have visited Hollywood Bowl numerous times and enjoy it every single time that I have went. It is great to be under the stars for concerts, especially since it sounds great from every seat in the house. For those that haven't been, I would highly encourage the park-n-ride shuttle system, as the busses will drop off and pick up right in front of the entrance. The parking is beyond horrific there...one of the worst places that I have experienced. For about 7.50 a person, you can park, get driven to the event and get picked up...and you can drink on the bus!!!!",lovetodive355
50,Fun under the stars,"My first visit to the Bowl was to see Bugs Bunny with the LA Phil. The audio and video were top rate. It was great fun to enjoy classical music with 10,000 fans of the rascally rabbit.",ABS_Boston_MA
50,Josh Groban & Fireworks !!,"If you go to the Hollywood Bowl, at least once in your life get garden seats. Well worth it !! Close to the stage and a table to eat your meal without having to juggle 10 things ! The concert was AMAZING !",LoriDunhamWilliams
50,July 4th Fireworks and Josh Groban,Enjoyed a picnic on the grounds surrounding the Hollywood Bowl before going to our seats to enjoy the LA Philharmonic playing patriotic music. The Salute to the Armed Forces especially moving as members of the Armed Forces were asked to stand.Josh Groban sang beautifully as always and the Fireworks are always well done and spectacular.Wonderful evening was had by all. Topped off by a relaxing ride back to our cars at the Park and Ride lot.,lbeluga
50,Wonderful evening,"Still the best of Los Angeles. July 4th - Josh Grobin, conductor Sarah Hicks. Great combination. You could have heard a pin drop when he sang. The fireworks never disappoint. The Hollywood Bowl is a treasure and is a constant reminder of the IMPORTANCE of music for education in our schools. Take the family, pack a meal and go for the fun of it. There is always something playing that will please someone in the group. If not, experience something out of your comfort zone and enjoy an evening under the stars. You can't miss.",Baron87
50,"Amazing, a truly Los Angeles experience","Pack your favorite bottle or two of wine, or pre-order your basket from Patia at the Bowl, and sit back to enjoy a one of a kind icon of a musical venue. First take a bus from one of the remote parking lots or surrounding communities. Take the hassles out of parking and traffic. If you're on benches, bring a seat pad, if you're in a box, arrive early and enjoy it.The ushers and wait staff are fantastic, the sound quality is perfection, and the buttered pop corn is the best to be found. Bring your own food and beverage, or get it at the bowl, but a meal before the show is part of the magic,Enjoy!",Mike90275
40,spectacular,"I went to the hollywood bowl with some friends for fourth of july, and the music was great, and we had a lot of fun. However, I was disappointed by the fireworks. I have seen better off of roofs of parking garages.",max m
50,Bugs Bunny at the Symphony,"Love, love, love this show! Saw it for the first time with my family and can't say enough good things about it. The Bowl is a wonderful family venue if you pick the right show. Next time, I'm arriving super early and sitting at one of the picnic tables to eat instead of balancing everything on my lap and trying not to spill anything on my neighbor. Popular shows do get quite crowded and the cheap seats are packed tight. Don't forget binoculars even though there are four large screens to see. Its still nice to see what you want to see closeup. We also ride the shuttle from the LA Zoo. Cost is $5 each but its very efficient and you're in and out in no time.",Aileen C
30,"Great acoustical quality, Expensive food, Uncomfortable seating","The concert was wonderful. We sat in the 1/3 closest to the stage and the sound was phenomenal. The projector screens were good quality.The stink of alcohol was just too much, and everyone was dropping their bottles, and since it's stadium-like seating, the bottles just kept rolling into people further down from the owners.The seats where we were at were wood benches. Super uncomfortable for extended periods of time, like longer than 45 min. They have cushions to rent for $1 though, if you're up for that.Food was expensive so we said no to that and went to Carl's Jr. for a real burger afterwards.All in all, the concert was amazing. The sound was wonderful.Cons: Uncomfortable seating, alcohol stench (and this was a family concert: Bugs Bunny at the Symphony II), and expensive food (but what do you expect at a well known landmark in Hollywood....)",B C
50,Great Outdoor Venue,"Great way to spend a Saturday! You can picnic before the event at a bench nearby or at your seat. It has 4 big screens in case you are seating in the back but I have never had a bad experience here. The one warning is that it is a walk. If you have someone older or with disabilities go with plenty of time. There is stack parking so to get out will be a while. Those are the only down sides to a wonderful, beautiful experience you will have.",Maritza_Cha
50,Wonderful concert on Fourth of July,"We attended the holiday concert again this year and once again we were not disappointed. The Los Angeles Philharmonic with guest conductor Sarah Hicks, Josh Groban, fireworks and perfect weather made for a wonderful way to celebrate Independence Day.",jojoys
50,Must See Visit,"Attended July 4th Groban, LA Phil concert & fireworks. Absolutely stunningly good, and a definite must do, if you get the chance. Booked online, picked up tickets at box office before the show, no problem. Worth taking a picnic and drinks as do most people, and make a fun night of it, arriving at least an hour earlier. Check if a ""leased"" event, as not allowed to bring own alcohol, or even cameras. Best web site to help is this one: http://hollywoodbowltips.com/?page_id=17",Faberge36
50,Fantastic! Take the Bus,"Excellent show and venue, saw Bugs Bunny at the Symphony II, great video, great orchestra, great seats (paid extra for a box). Gift stores inside and outside, but the gift store outside of the entrance has more stuff than inside the Bowl. Plenty of food for sale, bring your own. Use the bus, don't have to deal with parking, and looking at it, parking looked quite difficult. Very hilly for those with difficulties walking. Enjoy!!",JeffBransford
50,Not to be missed,"This is a monument to outdoor concerts. Although parking is a nightmare--take the park and ride busses from local lots--it is worth your time. It seats 18,000! Bring a picnic dinner or buy one on site. Wine is allowed except for rock concerts.",Lizznyc
50,Quintessential Los Angeles. A Must!,"I've been to Bowl performances more times than I can count. The Bowl is a wonderful outdoor amphitheater and is the summer home of the LA Philharmonic. Don't like classical music? Then consider Wednesday and Sunday evening performances that are typically jazz, blues or world music. Check out the summer schedule if you have flexibility. There are sing along shows (Grease, this summer) and other events with fireworks. The Bowl also leases the venue for some rock concerts. However these tend to be quite expensive. Regular Bowl events are very affordable. Bring your picnics. Eat at your seats and/or picnic areas in and around the bowl. There are park areas all around with tables. Check before you go. Some events you are not allowed to take alcohol inside the venue. Obviously the Bowl concessions want to sell their expensive beer and wine. Parking at the bowl is not the best. Stacked parking does not allow for easy exit. You can take Park & Ride buses to the bowl I've never done this...but it is an option.Want to see the Bowl but do not have time to see a show? It's part of the county park system. You can actually walk inside the amphitheater during the day and have a look. Make sure to walk up three tiers so you can take a photo of the iconic Hollywood sign. Enjoy.",Nancy D
40,Wonderful old outdoor bastion of the performing arts,"Nice venue, with a long & colorful history, but get there way earlier than you think you need to or you'll be really sorry & late for your show!As a native Californian, who loves the arts, you can guess I've been here many times over the years. Recently, my husband and I saw a very famous opera star perform here, & reserved box seats, gave ourselves an extra 1/2 hour to get here and was late & very frustrated as a result. Well, the concert was fantastic but the parking and traffic so horrible I nearly suggested we forget it & go home while sitting in traffic, maddeningly right next to the bowl, but unable to get there. The problem is: there are too few H-Bowl parking spaces, too many cars & only 3 streets going to an enormous venue. Thus, you will sit in traffic if you are not there way ahead of time. There are specific buses that will take you to the bowl, for a fraction of the cost of parking ($20-40), but they only pick-up from LA county cites & we live in Orange County! So, plan to get there and pick-nick or buy a boxed dinner from one of their upscale ""markets"" or restaurants or walk-up windows.",married&inlove
40,Outstanding concert facility with poor food,"This is the place to go to see concerts. 18,000 seats, but splurge and get a box. Under the stars (and the occasional private plane or police helicopter). The music and acoustics are fabulous.Bring your own food. Food service in the boxes is expensive and indifferent. Food service at the various kiosks is also expensive. We had an extraordinarily bad experience there some years ago. We ultimately learned that over 100 of 700 guests ho had ordered dinners called to complain. (That's an extraordinary rate.) Instead, go to Gelson's pick up one of their specially prepared Hollywood Bowl dinners, and have what you want.If you can, avoid stacked parking by the Bowl. Subway is not far, and there is dedicated bus service to various park and ride lots.",SoCalTraveler91356
30,Spend extra for great seats or don't bother,"I have been to the Hollywood Bowl many times. We buy tickets one event at a time. We are usually far back, which makes all of the shows anticlimatic and inconvenient for picnicing. However, if you pay the extra money to get into the section where they serve dinner in the open air concert hall, the evening is lovely and quite elegant.",Janet H
50,A must in LA,"I was reading about concerts in the area for my 4 day visit and read about opening night and the Hall of Fame Concert. I was lucky enough to buy 2 tickets online through a secondary market and took my son. Outstanding venue. Acoustics are superb, food was excellent and staff was very helpful.",Beth B
50,Great Show and Venue!,"We went to the Bowl on Sat. June 22nd to see Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, John Legend, and Patti Austin inducted into the bowl hall of fame. It was a great show. Each of the artists (group) did about 4 songs each and all were great. Stevie Wonder joined John Legend for one song. There were a few extras and fireworks too. New Screens and the music quality even sounded better than last year.Tips for the bowl: Always take a jacket, take the shuttle for parking-if smart, take a picnic basket (or buy food there), and rent cushions or bring your own (mostly wood benches).",CalifSue
50,Bring food and wine,We loved our first visit to HB. We did not know it but you can bring all the food and drink you wish to the concert! For $22 I sat in the very back section. The acoustics are a bit uneven and the acts are tiny but for $22 what more can you expect? There are HD screens that helped view the performers better. The view of the Bowl and the backdrop of the hills and Hollywood sign was tremendous. The bench seats were comfortable and the ambiance was very nice.,Bert F
50,Bowltastic,What an absolute ripper !! This place is a great venue for a concert of any sort. Do yourself a favour and get to anything that is playing here. And the views of the Hollywood sign are a bonus if you're in the cheap seats.,GeelongPhantom
50,Snuck in......,Wish! so wish! we had tickets to this place this evening. Fleetword Mac 'sold out' happening that night. Snuck in for a little look on the way out of L.A. Staff setting up didn't query our exploration. Took a few snaps and snuck out. Retrospectively we should have just taken a seat..... Next trip I'll definately purchase tickets to such a sweet venue. In the scale of musical arenas this looks brilliant.,clarebelleuk

50,Always a good time!,"I've been coming here for years and can't imagine not coming back each year! No matter who you come to see you should have an enjoyable visit. The venue is iconic, the architecture is known worldwide. It is always fun to bring your own picnic with your favorite wine, if you forget your bottle opener there is always a friendly concert goer who will share theirs! The music is always incredible and the fireworks are a great show. I can't wait to go this summer.",sixxmom
50,Great outdoor venue,"I love this place! Whatever the event, it's lovely to sit under the stars. My husband and I like to take our picnic basket, including wine, and enjoy a movie accompanied by the orchestra, or enjoy a performance. Definitely a place to visit. I highly recommend taking the metric because parking can be a pricey mess.",Travellr1978
50,"""What a place to see a concert or a person performing""!!",I was able to see Dolly Parton with a friend of mine last year! The venue is overwhelming: it is like a bowl carved out of the side of a mountain. I was given the impression that there was not a poor seat in the place. I had a great view of Dolly and was able to see her musical abilities.,Donald S
40,The Hollywood bowl is a great outdoor concert venue,"I have been for many concerts over the years. One thing I like is they celebrate the Fourth of July on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th. That way if your going out of town you can still enjoy the fireworks and concert show. Remember there will be a lot of walking to get to your seats so bring appropriate shoes.",Richard L
50,Bocelli concert was incredible,"NEVER drive and park in their lots. It will take you HOURS to get out of the lots and you will lose the glow you got from the concert. Instead, get a room at a hotel within walking distance (recommend LOEWS about a half mile away) and really enjoy yourself.Eat and drink beforehand. The food inside the Bowl is, in two words: BORING and EXPENSIVE. Tasteless. Even if you buy wine, for example, inside the Bowl, no glass is allowed so they open the bottle and pour it into big plastic glasses. Super over priced, too.ALSO, just because you paid hundreds for POOL seating tickets, that doesn't mean dinner service will be available. Ask before buying your tickets, if this is important to you. Sitting there is an incredible experience as you are close to the entertainers and the sound is fantastic.Rule #1: Stay at a hotel within walking distance.Rule #2: Eat/drink before the concert. Avoid the ""convenience"" of buying food or drink (water is OK) at the Bowl.Rule #3: Rent seat cushions. We sat in the POOL seating on HARD METAL FOLDING CHAIRS as they ""ran out of seat cushions"" - Bocelli was great enough that none of us noticed that our butts were numb.Rule #4: Enjoy yourself - the acoustics are amazing. Relax and enjoy. (Don't park your car!)",Stephanie L
40,A Concert Lovers' Heaven!,"The Hollywood Bowl is an amazing place to see a concert! We have been to the Jazz Festival in 2012 and in May 2013 to see Fleetwood Mac. There is a difference in rules depending on who is playing so be sure to check into that before your show. At the Jazz Fest all food and drink was welcome...for Fleetwood Mac no alcohol was allowed to be brought into the event. They do have beer, wine, and food for purchase during all events.The staff is professional at all locations. We have bussed in and also walked up from a nearby hotel. Loved the walk up with other excited patrons and the walk back to hotel was the bomb! Knock-off t-shirts at great prices, and vendors selling hotdogs fresh from the grill! Parking can really suck so plan on another arrival source than your vehicle.One piece of advise is to arrive early as the seating is bench style and if you are the last to arrive on you isle you will have a very hard time squeezing in.",Jalama
50,Outstanding venue !,"First time at the Hollywood Bowl. Other than the California Chill at night, (bring a blanket) and the fact that I didn't realize you could bring a cooler and food in with you, this was a top rated experience.The venue is entirely an outside ampitheatre with outstanding sound. Your view is of the hills of Hollywood and the stage sits below the Hollywood sign in the distance. Wow!We cuddled up and listen to Fleetwood Mac sing thier heart out, and it truly sounded better than the albums.There are a multitude of vendors offering wine/beer, healthy and not so healthy eats and the price was not as high as I would have thought.I WILL be back for another concert. It was completely worth the trip. However, I will sit closer than the far back, as the bowl is longer than it is wide.Go, you wont regret !",Lynne R

From the special light effects to the amazing sound that the bowl produces (even from way in the back) it is a venue that takes whatever concert you'll see there to another level. I am so impressed and can't wait to go back!,Allison R
40,Great Venue for a concert!,"As usual, we had a wonderful time at the bowl. Fleetwood Mac was amazing...they played all their oldies and some new songs. Their voices were as strong as ever. The only thing that was confusing is the bowl's no alcohol policy. Usually we take wine and dessert in to the bowl, but that night there was a sign posted that said no alcohol or glass. We asked several people and no one knew exactly what that meant as that is not their normal policy. Bottom line was we could have poured our wine in our plastic cups and taken it in, but didn't know that till we had already gotten rid of our bottle. Clarification would have helped.",jzk131
50,This place rocks!,"Wow, what a great place to go to a concert! Idyllic setting in the hollywoood hills. It is a madhouse getting there though. Suggest parking at the Highland Mall and then taxi up and walk back like we did. That worked out perfect.",Ken K
50,Wonderful experience; best outdoor venue ever,"Hollywood Bowl is tucked into a protected hillside and is an amazing park like venue. The LA Phil offers many outstanding concerts and during the summer movie ""sing alongs"" are very popular. Guests bring their own picnics and wine and it has the atmosphere of a fabulous party. The Bowl attracts top talent for special leased events, and no outside food or beverage is allowed at those events, although numerous options of food and drink for sale are available. We love to splurge on the garden terrace box seats, and love a magical night under the stars with great entertainment. Parking is easily available but waits are very long. We usually stay in a nearby hotel and walk to the bowl. Taxis are available but the wait can be long and you have the same issue of a long wait to exit. Try walking to Hollywood and Highland and catching a taxi there; you'll save a long wait!",3SBTraveler

Not a bad seat in the house as they have screens and the surroundings are stunning. Traffic looks terrible going I and output it's never as bad as you thinks.

30,The Hollywood Bowl needs a revamp,"Our daughter performs at the Bowl yearly with a local group. The parents are always given tickets and we made use of them once and only once. Speaking of the bowl alone, the seats are extremely hard and with a back support. Advice, bring some cushions and a blanket. The area can get nippy and uncomfortable. The programs there are fairly good.",Sonny
50,Great venue to see a show.,"This is an awesome venue and I recommend that everyone go at least once in their lifetime. The Bowl is pretty -like a hidden garden-and has a great view that you can enjoy before the show. We saw Eddie Izzard there and we were up pretty high. No problem hearing or seeing him. The Bowl allows you to bring in food, and most everyone has a picnic there. You can also buy food and drinks. There is a lot of walking uphill for the upper seats. Not sure if there is an elevator or not. Parking is easy, though- just across the street. It is tandem parking at the lot where we were, so plan to stay for the whole show if you park there.",pbmulligan
40,bowl is nice,"We spent time seeing several acts at the Bowl. We took a bus from Westwood and it is very easy and saves parking hassles. The bowl is has very nice setting and views. The food is good, and the scene is mellow. Go and try it out.",Gene G
50,Iconic LA venue,"Pick a show and go.The Bowl is an iconic venue and picnicking is a long practiced activity.Never bowled without picnicking.Parking issues and traffic are part of the ""charm""Celebrity and nouveau riche alongside regular folks.Eclectic performer combinations with bowl philharmonic along with independent shows.",Summerasalifestyle
50,A must if visiting L.A.,"I was born and raised in L.A. and am still enchanted with every visit to the Hollywood Bowl. If you're visiting you must add it to your to-do list. Hollywood itself is very dirty and run down in my opinion- not at all what you think of from the old movies, etc...I suggest skipping it and heading to the Hollywood Bowl instead for a concert. Doesn't matter which one you pick- it's the ambiance that is the greatest.I've never sat in a box with the table or the cushy seats, I've always purchased the cheap bench seats and brought a blanket to sit on. Come early with a picnic lunch- you can bring in your own alcohol as well which seals the deal for me. Alcohol at any event is insanely expensive, by allowing you to bring your own food and drinks it makes it an affordable option. Everyone plops down on the curbs/picnic benches leading up to the arena early and enjoys their picnics. We usually can't find space and take our food right into the arena and eat at our bench seats. As the sun starts to set the arena is beautiful, and a light breeze keeps it cooler on hot days. Everyone is so happy to be there, it makes the evening beautiful. The music is always so amazing- I've never been disappointed.Parking is the worst- don't do it! We take a park and ride shuttle from our home- they offer a dozen or so pick up spots around the whole city, so find the one closest to you and take the bus. It's only around $5 for a round trip ticket and well worth it. The parking is stacked at the bowl and you'll be trapped for hours trying to get out. When buying tickets try to attend an actual bowl series event and not a leased event. You can't bring your own alcohol to leased events, but usually you can bring food. The bowl events are more lax and affordable.",cakeshop
40,Huge,This was a stop on one our city tour. It is hard to see how big it is on TV but mark my words this is a huge entertainment centre. Beautiful to see where some of the greats have played over the years.,Elaine S
40,Music Under the Stars,"An LA landmark in a beautiful setting. We have been here several times for concerts. Sat up high but the giant screens let you see the stars close up, so intimacy is not needed; great acoustics too. You can bring in your own food and wine to have at your seats. Always rent the cushions so you don't have to carry yours up and down - lots of walking to get to seats and back to your car! We always park at the VFW parking lot - no stack parking there - but there is some waling uphill to get to the Bowl.",gardener4313
50,"AMAZING VIEW, makes youf eel lilke a MOVIE STAR","WOW. . . this place was a lot different than I thought it would be. Very homey and close. The acoustics are phenominal. I like the fact that the seats are soooooo close to the stage and every seat is a good one. I was there on an off day with no concerts so I was actually able to go up on the stage and get my picture taken. The view from the stage is amazing as well as the landscape all around the place. I was thrilled to think I was able to stand where Bette Midler stood while she was filming the movie BEACHES. That is one of my all time favorite movies and gave me a sense that I was at the real filming location. Whoever invented the Hollywood Bowl and the concept was a genius. This is a quaint little venue where the BEST and most famous stard perform. Other than going to the Rose Bowl I have to honestly say the HOLLYWOOD BOWL was the HIGHLIGHT of my trip. Sooo glad I got to go in and see the real deal for myself. GO THERE you will never be dissapointed with the visit, only dissapointed if you do not go and say OOH, I should have. I have wnted to go there since I was a little kid and now it is one location I can cross off my bucket list. I would love to go there to see a live concert or something on a future visit. THANKS HOLLYWOOD BOWL for being such a tourisf FRIENDLY place. I love this place a lot.",TRAVELDEB_10
50,Another LA must do.,Worth the visit no matter who is performing. A true landmark that you will always remember. Parking can be a challenge and don't plan on being able to leave as soon as the concert is done. Suggest taking one of the shuttles that are available. Great place to do a picnic before the show too.,larrywatsonl
50,Best Night of my Life!,"I went to an Anita Baker concert at the Hollywood Bowl on a Wednesday night. I wish I could describe the atmosphere, words don't do it justice! Aside from my phone dying at the worst possible time, Anita Baker and Esperanza Spaling were exceptional performers on top of a cool starry night at the Hollywood Bowl in the Hollywood Hills. The venue, the atmosphere, and performers is something that can't be duplicated anywhere else.The cool thing is that the grounds are free during the day. You're not supposed to walk on stage, but you can as long as you're not being silly. You can bring your own food and wine which makes it all the better. Couldn't have asked for a better outing/date/event to attend on a Wednesday night.",Jeremy M
20,Cheesy,"Being my first time in L.A., maybe my expectations were too high.My LA friends told me it was going to be so.. and it was! Cheesy, dirty and nothing worth seeing. Crowded with freaks on movie characters costumes charging you for photos which, in my opinion, would have been even more cheesy than the Boulevard itself.To see the Hollywood sign from the mall next to the Kodak Theater was the only mildly cool thing to do.Won't go back there in my next trip to L.A.",Cgrlaw
50,Playboy Jazz is the best!,"This yearly event in one mid-June weekend event is the best concert I have ever attended! It lasts about 10 hours if you and your friends decide to get there early to have a nice picnic and lunch before the concert. We go there around 1:00-1:30 in the afternoon and just hang out. The concert stats at 3:00pm and goes until 10:30 or 11:00. If you were a wine drinker, make sure to bring 2 bottles each because we ran out of wine after 5 hours. One needs to experience this. It's the best!!!",Travellibra
50,A show at the Bowl is always good,"I've seen about a dozen shows in the last five years - from Pavement and Sonic Youth to ABBA 2/0, Stevie Wonder to Journey. I enjoyed them all. The rules are different for lease events (big name shows). No booze or bottles, etc. For Bowl events, wine is allowed and it is common to see hundreds of people in the park nearby or even right outside the entry gates drinking wine before the show. It's a big bowl and holds almost 20,000 people. Don't get parking at the bowl unless you want to get stuck in among hundreds of other cars.",prdx2222
50,By all means go!,"If there's something going on at the Bowl that interests you should definitely go. It's a concert venue located in a beautiful setting. The attractive reflective pool in front of the stage has been gone since 1972 for acoustical reasons but otherwise this is the Hollywood landmark we've known since childhood. Nothing tops a breezy summer evening with the moon and stars overhead listening to a full symphony orchestra. Wine is available for sale and you're allowed to carry in your own picnic basket (if I'm not mistaken bringing in your own booze is forbidden). If you're able to get there via public transportation instead of by car I recommend the bus or a taxi. Exiting the parking lot afterwards can take forever. BTW, years ago when I lived in the neighborhood the public was allowed to attend the morning dress rehearsal of the evening concert performance for free. Not sure if this policy still exists but I can't see why it wouldn't.",Kerry A
50,A must see,"We've been there several times. Once even while nothing was playing. Got up on the stage (to an empty audience) as if singing a concert. For actual concerts, the place is amazing. I love it. Go, Go, Go!",D w

50,Worth it.,"There is something magical about the Hollywood Bowl. I've never had a bad experience in over two dozen shows. Yes, there are some hassles: it is a long walk from parking and there can be restrictions on food/beverages you are allowed to bring in. Do your research on their website before your show, and you'll be fine. It's an incredible experience to share with friends, family or a date. If you can reserve a picnic booth with friends, you'll have a great time.",zeppo33
40,Well worth the visit,"We visited the Hollywood Bowl as part of the Starline City Tour in 2012. The place is massive and quite impressive. When you are in there , you get an idea of how big it is and how the entertainers must feel on stage.I would certainly visit again.",rs041614n
50,Amazing,We went to the Hollywood Bowl although there wasn't an event on. It was amazing. We were the only people there and were able to wonder around freely and there was no charge. Behind the stage you also get a great view of the Hollywood sign which was a bonus. It is only a five minute drive away from Hollywood Boulevard and well worth a visit.,TheDuchessNottingham
50,LA landmark that you should visit,"This is one of the attractions that you want to go to every year. It is so much fun going with friends or family. It does cost sort of a lot per person, but it is usually worth it. Since the seats are hard wood/concrete, they have cushions for rent (i would recommend renting) I would also recommend bringing a blanket and lots of food. They have concession stands, but the shows are usually right around dinner time (6 pm) and the little kids will get hungry. Amazing experience- please visit!",Sophie M
50,Concert Heaven!!!,"You cannot go wrong with a going to a concert in the Hollywood Bowl, it's always amazing, comfortable and different from anywhere else due to the atmosphere, open air and ability to bring your own food, like a picnic basket.",NeedsAVacation25
40,Excellent night out under the stars,"The perfect spot to enjoy a night out with your friends or just your significant other. My wife and I truly enjoyed our spot, Section F. We brought our very own drinks and snacks (wine and sandwiches). The bus transportation makes it super easy to get there. No worries whatsoever.",brownybros21
20,Seats suck,The acoustics are good but the seating sucks. Uncomfortable and the arrangement seems more designed for getting people in to pay for over priced food and wine. The Greek is much better for concerts.,Jason F
50,Nothing Like it in the world,Back in the 1990's I moved to the Hollywood Hills just so I could walk to the Bowl. I have been a season subscriber since 1995. It is one of the greatest experiences ever. Every type of music all summer long. Bring your wine and food 2 hours early to enjoy the sunsets and fun guests. So many places to picnic or just sit in your seats to eat and drink. Bring your food as Patina is expensive and slow. Go online and look at the schedule. You can call them direct for your exact seating or go to the box office and buy. Even go anytime to check out the Bowl. It is open all day to visitors. So you can even try out your seats before you buy them. There is only one Hollywood Bowl. Season starts in June. Can't wait.,pjbfilm

50,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,"As a young teenager I used to go to the Hollywood Bowl every summer with friends, climbing to the top to hear the gorgeous sounds from the orchestra. Now, in my later years, I sit much closer and still listen to the beautiful sounds of the orchestra. It's good to come early to get a good parking space and then enjoy the lovely balmy evenings sitting and eating your easy dinner while enjoying the music.",Doris P
50,Bus here from a suburb.,"Unique outdoor musical or performance experience. You will walk a lot, up hills. Traffic in and out of the area is a nightmare. ADVICE- Take a special bus from an outlying suburb (Example- Santa Monica) for a few dollars; you will be home before many others.",Bill T
40,"Not Big, But Worth a Stop","The Hollywood Bowl has been around, I don't know, almost forever. How did it begin? How did a plywood temporary building last so long? The answers are at the museum. I'll let you in on a secret, that first bowl didn't last this long. There have been a number of replacements over the years, each better than the one before (except a lot of people didn't like those big while balls that helped improve issues with echos).",Kenneth L
40,"Nice way to get entertained, especially if you snag a box seat","An excellent amphitheater which every Angeleno should try at least once. It is well maintained and attended to by it's staff, which makes your concert experience much more pleasant. The box seats in the lower bowl are worth the extra cost, and bringing your own wine, food and friends makes a concert much more special.",John P
30,It could be so much more...,"With the VERY significant acts that have been there over the decades, I felt that I should have been made to feel a part of that history. But, the exhibits are something one might enjoy when standing in a long line or for the hardcore knowledge seekers. Peace.",Michael G
40,Music Royalty Played Here,"You can't live in or visit L.A. and not go to at least one performance at the Hollywood Bowl. This place is not just a venue, it is a history lesson of every major musical act for the last fifty years, plus much more (like Monty Python & John Williams). Be sure to come early, bring a picnic lunch (or make a reservation at the restaurant), and allow enough time to visit the museum. We attended a concert with Carol King and James Taylor...wonderful...acoustics are terrific in the Bowl. If you are in the cheap seats, it is a long & winding road (yes, the Beatles appeared here for $7 in 1964 & 1965), but there are vendors along the way to distract you from the climb, and sell you more food/drink, if still hungry/thirsty, along with concert memorability,Once you finally get to the Bowl (there are benches to rest along the way and the climb is on a wide paved ramp) the seating is a wood bench and not very comfortable, so bring your stadium seats with the back. We were not at the very top, about the high middle, yet the stage is tiny from up there. Bring binoculars to augment the the big screens. One final note, unless you go in the middle of the summer, the Bowl is outside and it gets cold at night, bring coats, sweaters, stadium blanket, etc.Not the greatest place to comfortably see a performer, unless you can afford the hundreds of dollars to sit in the boxes near the stage, but definitely an experience you won't want to miss.http://youtu.be/an-kMAPuIj0",Rich A

40,A Fun Evening,"Went to nice concert last year. LA traffic?? No problem-just go on line and preorder a bus ride from one of many sites in the city. Park and the site. Ride the bus. Bring what you wish to eat and drink on the bus. You can drink-(my choice wine) on the ride. Some passengers were very friendly and offered to share drinks, food , on the way (but more so on the return trip). Once there, driver lets you know where to return. Pillow cushions for seats are available for nominal fee. Food, drink can be purchased or brought from home to your seat. Box seats are closer to stage. We sat on benches a good distance from stage ,but big screens may it easy to see performers. Nice people , great atmosphere outdoors and easy trip-no hassle!",Bernard t
40,Would love to return for a performance!,"We stopped here on an LA tour, and enjoyed seeing the venue, even though there was not a performance scheduled.

40,A True Classic,"Indulged in some summertime classical music with a friend who was visiting from the UK. It was also my first time at the Bowl, so the whole experience was delightful.

50,A Los Angeles treasure,Taking a picnic dinner to the Bowl and then listening along with thousands of others to the Hollywood Bowl orchestra or whoever is playing that evening is one of the best things about living in LA. It's also one of the few places where you can see Angelenos gather together and remain considerate of each other....everyone seems to clean up after their picnic and is in a good mood. And why not? The Bowl is all about good times.,JimSeth
50,A very very special place,"The bowl is one of the very special California experiences. I first visited in 1969 and saw Frank Zappa. I think I got stoned just from the second hand smoke. I have seen Ella, Vince Gil, the sound of music sing along, jimmy Buffett, Tom petty and many many pop groups. W have had a series subscription to classical nights for 5 years, seeing the L A Phil. We loved the Hollywood bowl orchestra too. We ve enjoyed many nights of fireworks. We always bring a picnic. Sitting in box seats or way up high is equally fun. It is truly a privilege to be able to attend this very special place.PS. We take the shuttle bus from Griffith Park...no parking woes.",DrKeithEvan

50,How can you rate such a place? It's the best.,"The Hollywood Bowl is one of the great things about LA. It is extraordinary. So beautiful. It is very well organized with all sorts of dining and drinking options as well. Need to go online and plan that part. Also, people bring fabulous picnics and there are tables in the boxes, or you can eat at tables/ grass around the Bowl. The only thing about eating in the boxes is if you are big or a little claustrophobic the space can feel tight. So also great to bring wine/ cheese/ snacks. They bring in amazing artists and quite a variety of classical, jazz, rock, etc. Tickets can be pricey but it's usually a very worthwhile experience.",tripindicular1
50,How can you not enjoy the Hollywood Bowl?,"How can you not enjoy the Hollywood Bowl? The seats are priced for all budgets and all offer the enjoyment of Bowl events. Sometimes the people sitting in the trees, the cheap seats, are having more fun than those in the stodgy seats near the stage. Or at least that's what I see through my binoculars. The summer schedule offers events for all interests including the annual Sing Along Sound of Music and wonderful quintets and even rock and roll.Yes, it is crowded and you will feel foolish later if you attempt to park at the bowl. Take one of the Bowl buses or use the Hollywood/Highland shuttle from the subway.",Cavydad
50,Classsic LA experience,We used to have a box for the summer concert series. The bowl is a classic LA experience.

40,"Very good food, but bring a picnic basket!","People eating at the Hollywood Bowl are there to see a live performance, so food is secondary to the event. A lot of ""locals"" come here often, but, they bring elaborate picnic baskets, and come early enough (2 hours before event) to enjoy on the grassy park areas just outside the Hollywood Bowl.

I was always able to get concert tickets for under $50, and it's so much fun for a night out. I would highly suggest taking the shuttle though as parking is a complete nightmare, just prepare in advance and you will be fine. And let me just tell you after you leave there are some delicious street vendors outside the bowl waitng to feed you. yum yum yum!!!

50,This place fills you up and never lets you down!,"This place is truly a magical venue where even the most snobby venue friends I know love it for the atmosphere, sound and tranquility of it.",Grant L
50,Great venue,An amazing place to see a concert especially classical or jazz. The parking isn't as bad as most venues but still give yourself ample time to park & walk.,NanceeLeeAllen
40,Good place to visit,"fre museum, can enter the park for free if no event is on, amazing to see the size of the place. Quite a walk out of town but we didn't mind that. Sure there are buses that go there if you wanted",northernpixie64
50,LA Phil A Bargain,This is a great way to spend a summer night. I love watching Dudamel and the LA Phil anytime. But at the Bowl it is great with a picnic and a good wine.. The acoustics are not as good as Disney Hall but that place spoils you and any other venue is always lacking. The audience for Classical events is very quite and respectful. I have not enjoyed events that attract noisy young folks.,Ralph H
50,Wonderful time at The Bowl.,"Can not believe it took us that long to finally attend the show at Hollywood Bowl ( lived in LA for 8 years), but after being there once, we will definitely attend more events there. The show we attended was a LA symphony playing French music with a wonderful Paris Combo and the dancers from Moulen Rouge. Excellent show on beautiful evening in the wonderful venue. Bring your picnic basket, your food, wine and enjoy the show of your choice at The Bowl.",kruzers19
50,Wonderful Outing,Hollywood Bowl is a wonderful place for everyone at every age depending on the event. You can go a couple hours earlier before the event starts and have a picnic outside. It is especially enjoyable in the summer because it is outdoors.,dina d
50,A Must Do!,"Whether you live in Southern California or are visiting, this is a must thing to do. Bring a picnic and a bottle of wine to enjoy the people, the scenery, and the great music. Getting there can be a challenge, and on a really crowded night you might have to picnic on the ground (bring a blanket), but it's so worth any inconvenience you encounter.",Linda C
50,Los Angeles classic venue,"one cannot miss a visit in the summer. choose a box, pack a picnic or order from their dining selections..food is delivered to the box which is complete with chairs and tables. Then relax and enjoy the music on a beautiful summer evening Perfection",janieB1123
30,See a show there,Its a good place to see a concert but overall not worth seeing if they aren't open for business or nobody is on the stage.,Speel
50,Excelent,loved this place and would love to go back again. What a great bulding. Loved how clean and well kept this place was,Ditsycompanion
40,Great place for a concert but get there early!,Love the outdoor venue which allows you to bring in your own drinks and food but hate the parking. My advice is get there early and park at a distance and walk. The lots stack park which means it could take up to an hour to get out of the lot.,Caroline L
50,"First time at the Bowl, loved it!","Had always heard about how unique and fun the Hollywood Bowl was, and I watched Mumford and Sons perform. What an experience! Even the ""high-end"" restaurant upstairs was shockingly good --- amazing service, great food and fast. If there's a band playing you like --- go!",AppreciateAdvice
50,The mondern side of the perfection of ancient Greek theaters.,Love enjoy the performance when is operating.Tickets are expensive..You can visit it any time because always they prepare something for event..Also visit the Heritage museum there.,Christo G
30,Parking Hell,We experienced an unforgettable concert but thankfully used a car service with an experienced driver. Do not park on premises. I think there STILL trying to get out of that lot. Utter chaos.,gwcala
50,One of the best things LA has to offer (and they have A LOT to offer!),"It just isn't summer if we don't go to the bowl at least once. The atmosphere is fantastic, and picnicking beforehand is part of the charm of the evening. They have great areas to picnic, and wonderful shows to choose from. My biggest gripe is the cost of parking-it's absolutely highway robbery to charge what they charge (it goes up every year.)",christinascucina
40,Awesome,Enjoyed some jazz here over the summer. This was the first time at the Hollywood Bowl and I look forward to coming back. The outdoor venue feels fantastic in the summer. The overall attitude was laid back.,Thilmoe
30,GREAT acoustics. Next time I'll try to get pool tix...,"I want to rate the beloved Hollywood Bowl Higher than a 3,I really do.But in my heart of hearts I can't because of the shock I had when I saw how large this venue really is, and how far back some of the sections go (hellooooo out there!). I can't believe they sell tickets to people that far out!Tickets for this venue vary by artist, but usually are relatively cheap once you're past the box seating, and now I know why. I enjoy concerts, but I'm spoiled and like to be in the thick of things where I can see the artist(s) and really vibe off of them.I don't know how anyone could possibly get the great feeling you get when you experience a concert when they're seated out in the boondocks and can barely see the stage.The STAFF, however, were amazing. I really give kudos to them for being so polite, helpful, and really kind to us.So I learned my lesson, bite the bullet and pay a fortune to get the full ""concert experience"".",BuddhaInHeels

50,Best deal in town,"I spend many nights every summer at the Hollywood Bowl. It has a variety of musical styles--classical, pop, world music, jazz, movie music...You can spend a lot and have valet parking and sit in a box. Or you can spend $3, take the bus for $5 and have a wonderful evening.",kathleene_12
50,Quintessential LA Concert Venue,"As a fan of all types of performing arts and a picnic lover, I could not ask for a better venue to watch a live performance. The 2012 concert series included amazing acts including Placido Domingo and Gustavo Dudamel performing together. These two musical titans put on quite the show for classical music fans and opera aficionados. We sat in the green super seats which are in the dead center of this lovely outdoor amphitheater and most definitely the most comfortable seats in the house. We also saw Juanes perform as well as Barry Manilow and we attended a Sing-a-Long too. I had the opportunity to sit in bench seats, terrace box seats, and super seats, and clearly the super seats are the most comfortable although box seats afford you the opportunity to picnic properly with a pop up table and waiter service prior to the show beginning. Almost all the weekend spectaculars include fireworks as well as the 4th of July series, which are worth seeing. Bowl fireworks are amazing and very unique, you have to see them at least one time if you visit LA during the summer months. Perhaps the most ingenious part of the Bowl is the fact that you can picnic, at all Hollywood Bowl sponsored events. This means you can bring any type of food and drink, including wine and spirits, that you want. the Hollywood Bowl is the place to have yourself a great time with family or friends. I strongly recommend parking at one of the Park and Ride stations because most parking is stacked and costs $15 dollars, the shuttles run frequently and arrive early enough to allow for picnicking before the concert begins.",Teeplepeople
40,great time!,We had a blast here!but be careful they has trouble keeping their bathrooms clean :| other than that great time!!,Ros568
50,Best Venue on Earth,Beautiful acoustics are one thing. The beautiful environment is another. The best thing is seeing a great act and being able to bring what you want for a picnic and enjoy an amazing evening.,N1120A
40,Barbara Streisand Was Excellent,"The Bowl got a bit cold this fall evening and seating numerous late arrivers was disrupting. Otherwise, this was a glorious evening with the great Barbara Streisand. After 50 years of entertaining, Barbara still has so much natural talent.Our hotel prepared a lovely picnic basket that we enjoyed. Many around us simply ordered the Bowl's meals. We were fairly close and had a good view and sound. Bring binoculars if your seats are farther back. While there are viewing monitors, the quality of their projection is noticeably below the live view.Seems like they could use a few more bathrooms although the bathrooms were well above average for such a venue. Parking looked horribly chaotic but we took a taxi to/from the event. We walked down the hill a couple blocks rather than standing in the taxi line at the Bowl.",Bruce S
50,Great venue for concert,"We saw Mumford and Sons and thought the venue was perfect. The acoustics were very good, even though we were sitting towards the back. And we could see the Hollywood sign from where we sat. Heard that stacked parking is an issue, so we opted to walk in from off-site parking. Be sure to check the weather/temperatures and come adequately prepared. And the HB allows picnics on their grounds so bring some food along!",DurangoFam
30,striesand,The concert itself was wonderfull. but the venue is outragesly expnsive on all levels. The box seats are like sitting four people in and old VW bug. It cost us $45 dollars for a veggie wrap and a bowl of pasta. $16 for 4 hot chocolets.,passion-for-travel53
50,Hmmm the best place for womans,"Luxurious shopping arcade for woman, all special and limited edition are here, just full your pocket or credit card otherwise you gonna miss it",Lina Jasin
50,Small Venue Amazing Acts,"You can see anyone from Barbra Streisand to an ABBA cover band. Bob Dylan to The Sound of Music sing-a-long. It's a classic venue that is comfortable and not overcrowded. Don't park there, you'll get stuck for awhile. Park at one of the lots near Hollywood and Highland and take a little walk.",hobojungle
50,A must see,"Any trip to LA, the Hollywood Bowl is a must experience. I suggest taking the bus (look it up). Get terrace box seats or garden box seats and bring your wine and cheese at least an hour early with your date and friends. Then enjoy the show. The sound is great and so amazing. Who knows who you'll see in the next box....",Targettt
50,Hollywood Bowl,"Watched the setting up for a concert,preferred the posh seats cushions provided and proper seats not concrete one lol",barbaraWales
50,A must!,"Perfect date night. Your summer is not complete until you do a picnic concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Whether you do a jazz concert or a classical show witht the Los Angeles Philharmonic while watching fireworks, it's definitely a perfect place to spend many summer evenings.",Kimmiep2000
50,Sound-of-Music Sing-A-Long!!,"This was my first experience!! I never saw the musical before and now I am hooked. FYI this review is biased because I went during an event, so I do not know how the bowl handles its business otherwise. Great Location, I suggest taking their bus, drops you off and picks you up for CHEAP. I will definitely try to go to more sing-a-longs --I wonder how the grease one is :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : ): ) :)",Kenny L
50,A Magical Place,"Yes, it is crowded and a bit hard to get to and park, but once you get through all that, the sound and the ambience is beyond description. No better way or place to spend a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night.",rjgagliano
40,Concert Venue,"We come to the Bowl every year for concerts. If you come for the orchestra shows you can bring in a picnic basket or cooler with food and wine. No outside food or alcohol is allowed for the rock shows. Parking is a big hassle here. All parking is stacked so you have to wait for everyone else to come back to their cars before you can leave.It normally takes several hours for the parking lots to clear out. If you can get a cab or public transportation it is a great place to eat, drink and relax to music under the stars.",dcoder8

50,A true Los Angeles Landmark.,"The Bowl is an experience that should be experienced at least once if you can make it happen. A nice venue, beautiful setting. Take a sweater - it gets chilly at night",Where2GoWhere2go
50,Concert Hall,"Great place!!!!!!! I think every person needs to be there and list to music once in his life. I love being there. You can have drink and enjoy the concert, show etc.",Elya87
50,Amazing venue for music,We saw Florence and the Machine in October here and loved the venue. It has a great party atmosphere in the area outside the gates with many people enjoying some food or drink together. Easy to get into due to the separate entrances for the sections and the communal bench like seats are great. The sound was fantastic for an outdoor venue.,GoAstro
50,Have a picnic,"Brilliant communal atmosphere and everybody walking about clutching Wholefoods bags or their kiost stall purchase. Nice views of the city from some look outs... and listening to your favourite music with everybody feeling the awesome vibe on a balmy evening under the stars in Hollywood, glass of wine or beer in hand? Amazing!!!",Destination Victoria
40,First Time at Hollywood Bowl,"Our first experience at the Hollywood Bowl was a great one - Garrison Kellor and Prairie Home Companion live radio show. I've listened to this show for years, so seeing the performers and skits live was a thrill. Martin Sheen was the special guest and was terrific. These guys are so talented - I don't think people realize how ""off the cuff"" Kellor works and it's just brilliant. Enjoyed sitting in the ""box seats"" with tables - we ordered a dinner from the venue, but many people brought their own food and drinks. The table was a little unstable but that was our only problem. Definitely one of the coolest venues to see a show in the US.",FranklinSusu
50,You simply have to go,"Our family has gone to the Hollywood Bowl at least once every summer for over 30 years. We pack a picnic dinner, with red checkered tablecloth, candles, and wine, and get there early (4:30 - 5:00) to get a table in one of the picnic areas. Either someone takes the picnic paraphernalia back to the car before the concert starts, or we sit with it at our feet in the bowl.Bring a sweater, because it can get chilly after the sun goes down, and do wear walking shoes because it is a hilly area and quite a hike to get to your seats from the parking areas.We drive our own car, though parking is expensive and it is somewhat nerve-wracking and time-consuming to get out of the lot after the concert. Some people swear by the bus service, but we have not found it to be any more efficient, and you cannot get there as early to get a picnic table.Weeknight concerts are less expensive, and the people who attend them are less drunk and rowdy, than the weekend events, when they have more popular themed concerts with fireworks, etc.But if it was a choice between a weekend concert and not attending at all, by all means, go on the weekend.",jjsmama

40,Florence and the Machine at the Hollywood Bowl!,"We came to see Florence and the Machine at the Hollywood Bowl whilst we was holiday in LA, The whole experience was incredible with the most amazing atmosphere and the incredible sound that the bowl creates. We was sat on row 18 in block k and we had a great view of the band and the bowl! I dont think the prices are that bad but you can take youre own picnic etc but no alcohol, though im sure we could have took some in and it looks like most people was taking it in anyway. one day we hope to return to see another concert here! I do suggest though that you only get there about an hour-45 minutes before the concert unless you want to see the support acts and you have a picnic. Also its great to come and admire the bowl in the day as well!",orlandouk
50,Best place to see a live performance,"The Hollywood Bowl always delivers an amazing evening. The sound is incredible, the venue is beautiful, the rooftop grill is highly recommended and taking the offsite shuttle is the way to go.Just saw Brad Paisley and The Band Perry. Simply incredible.",Cynthia S

50,Fantastic historic venue. Arrive before dark!,"Hectic madhouse upon arrival if you don't go early. Before dark is a must to enjoy the setting. You can hear perfectly from anywhere.

50,One of a kind,"Whether you live in LA or are visiting in the summer the Hollywood Bowl is a one of a kind experience. You can take a picnic basket and wine, have a relaxed dinner and then hear first class symphonic music - or jazz- or broadway - or pop. There is something for everyone every season. An LA must!!",Tim H
40,It wouldn't be summertime without this place,I love the Hollywood Bowl. Beautiful venue to see a concert. And you can pack your own dinner and eat while you watch. Great for dates or family outings. Great for out of town guests. Parking can be hectic but many hotels offer shuttles there.,L2Connelly
50,Hollywood Bowl,"Having gone to the Hollywood Bowl multiple times this summer, I can state unequivicably that you won't find better acoustics in amy outdoor stadium. It doesn't matter where you sit, the sound is perfect anywhere. The only loss from sitting at the back of the Hollywood Bowl is visually seeing the orchestra or guest performer. The fireworks at the Bowl are among the best I've ever seen.",Neil E
50,One great night,"We saw Wilco at the bowl in late September and it was tremendous. We sat in the terrace boxes and it was worth the extra spend. Sound was perfect, lights were really cool and the overall experience was amazing. I read traffic can be a nightmare on show evenings so we opted for a hotel within walking distance. Just perfect.",Dennis W
40,Sound of Music Sing along,"Sounds stupid yet it was very fun. We didn't know what to expect and showed up at the gate time and noticed that thousands had come early to have a picnic meal before the show. Many were dressed up appropriate for the movie, there was a lovely pre show parade of costumes, props were given to the audience for participation during the movie and there was no hesitation for everyone to sing along and interact. It was hysterical and family oriented. This is an annual event.",kgilbert_12
40,Great sound no matter where you sit,"This was the third time I've been to the Hollywood Bowl and I've sat in a different place each time. The sound is fantastic. The rows of seats are a little too close together, so if you are tall you might be uncomfortable unless you are sitting in a box. If the Bowl is putting on the event, you can bring in a picnic lunch/dinner including alcohol and get there early to relax and enjoy. If it's a leased event, no outside alcohol is allowed, but you can still picnic if you want. Get there early if you want to avoid the cattle call, there is only one way in and out of the place (unless you are the artist!). If you can avoid having to park there, do it. Otherwise plan on about at least an hour to get out of there after the show. Obviously the closer you are to the stage the better, but there really isn't a bad seat in the house.",Sarah P
50,Atmospheric,This place is simply written in the Hollywood history books! If you like the artist - this place is a must to visit. You don't get front seats. They are reserved for the locals and people who have season tickets - but still worth going to this iconic theatre.,TheFlyingFrock
30,Hollywood Bowl Museum,"The Museum seems like an afterthought...it is sorta cool, some neat stuff there, but really small, and pricey if you want to buy anything...a tourist trap, or a tourist goal...you pick...I was not really useful of it. It simply is...where you hang out while you wait for a concert, or...where you visit if you wish to go to the museum...",DantheMountainMan
40,Florence and the Machine,"I wanted to see the space so badly i was wiling to see any show while we were in LA on our honeymoon - was very happy to be able to take in Florence and the Machine. However, I need a 2nd trip because we got there after dark so I didn't get a great feel of the architecture, plus, I didn't realize how serious the whole picnic idea was! We figured just those with box seats did the whole outdoor meal thing you read about - but as we walked up the driveways were lined with people all laid out with full meals - it definitely seems like the thing to experience - will plan for a second trip! The sound was amazing and so was the show.",genegenie1106
50,Summer time fun!,"I always attend the Summer Jazz Series of concerts on Wednesday nights ,as well as, Playboy Jazz Festival and JVC. Always a great crowd and fun.

You can see many music legend here.",NJOY909

50,Incredible!,I had only seen the 'Bowl' in movie scenes. I was amazed by it. I climbed all the stairs so that I could take in its glory. This is the best site I saw while in Cali. Next time I want to see a show there.,mama030
50,Pack a Picnic,"The Hollywood Bowl is the BEST place to see concerts in Los Angeles, hands down. There isn't a bad seat in the house even if you just buy the $8 tickets and sit on the grass in the back. They will let you bring any food or drink you want in with you. My sister and I always pack an amazing wine and cheese basket and usually throw in some Bay Cities subs for when the wine is gone.It'll be an experience you remember forever and can't wait to do again, I promise! :-)",maggie k
50,nice,we didn't have anything to do for the evening and went there for a concert. Tchaikovsky music was good and it was romantic too,Nataliya V
40,BB King concert,Loved the Hollywood Bowl. The setting was good for the concert. We sat in the area of bench row seating. We took a pillow to sit on. They had cushions for hire as well. We had a good view of the stage and large TV screens. There was picnic style tables/chairs seating further forward which could be booked as well. As we got tickets late that area was booked out. We were told as part of the experience we needed to have a picnic on the grass before the concert. We did this and was good. There was food and drink places open but the beer and wine was very expensive.,Sharon W
40,"Fun venue to be at, horrible traffic to get there","I love that it's outdoor and high up that you can view some parts of LA. At classical concerts we can bring in wine along with snack freely. However, the last time I was there (for a Kelly Clarkson concert) assuming I can bring my wine and snacks as usual which turned out to be prohibited for that particular event. My friends and I were quite disappointed because we have always been able to bring them in our previous concerts. Parking is expensive but not too surprising for these types of venues in LA. Getting here on a week day can be a nightmare during rush hour so you might want to plan your route accordingly as well as coordinate with your work hour to make there on time for the full shows.",Hanley L

We sat all the way in the back row, so the sound wasn't perfect. But otherwise, it was a beautiful night at the bowl, with warm weather, great friends, and an awesome show.The Bowl is not the best venue in the city (people often talk over the music, it's not the best for sound being outdoors) but it's so beautiful and has such a rich history. I love this place a lot and last night reaffirmed my love.",Seth G
30,More hype than worth it,"This place is a classic LA spot. Every season the concerts hit every genre. Sound has been improved , you can get food from cheap eats to high end fare. However, parking is really bad, Traffic is worse. You really have to want to hear the music before you make this your choice for the evening. The negatives make the bowl a wash.",Frank G
40,Awesome Venue,"The Bowl is breathtaking. For Dave Matthews Band Sept 2012, the part of the audience where we were seated was talking through the whole performance, but really loud toward the end. We left before the encore. Two years ago, we saw the Eagles, fell in love with the awesome venue, and made another trip from Texas just to be there again. The audience made this visit less than magical. Perhaps it was just the location of seats for DMB, and we should've bought more expensive tickets!",TexasSM
50,The Sound of Music Sing-A-Long @ Hollywood Bowl,"Spring for the box seats and enjoy your pre-show picnic in comfortable chairs with backs (instead of bleacher seats) on a cute little table set up by your box boy. Hubby surprised me with this once-a-year event. People come in costume (Nuns to Nazis) and bring elaborate picnics complete with flowers and candles, wine and pate'. Hiss at the Baroness, Boo Franz, Awwwwww over Gretel. This classic movie with subtitle song lyrics is an audience participation delight. There's a preshow costume parade and 5 of the original Von Trapp movie kids co-hosted.Warning!!!! Traffic is a nightmare. Give yourself an hour more than you think you will need to get there. Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time getting out of the parking lots. This event sells out (19000 people) and it's a tangled mess.

Getting there can be a nightmare unless you take one of the shuttles, but once inside you can find restrooms, food, and a great place to listen to music. The problems arise AFTERWARDS, when over 9,000 people try to leave at the same time. The exits are just not large enough to accommodate everyone.",Janet P
50,Nice night out under the stars,"We were lucky to get seats up close at the BOWL. They had tables so that you were easily able to bring a boxed dinner. The sound quality was excellent. For the crowd, there were ample Ladies rooms and so there was no waiting. Very important to me with this type of venue. They are so lucky in La to have this outdoor theater.",Dolores C
30,There is a bad seat in the house...,"in fact there are quite a few. It's a privelage to have seen one of my favorite artists perform here. The Hollywood Bowl is a legendary venue. With that said, they over price thier tickets. There are bad seats, where you had better bring binoculars. Save your money and take a road trip to Denver to see the performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre.",Amanda V
50,Exciting concert at a great venue,"I saw Brian Setzer there. It was great fun with fireworks. All seats are good, but you will get more comfy ones and a great view if you pay a little extra. I recommend the Park and Ride option, and it is cheaper if you book online at least 2 weeks in advance. I also recommend taking a picnic dinner to enjoy before the show.",Wendy P
50,A Hollywood Gem,DO NOT miss this Hollywood icon if in the area. The Hollywood Bowl is a gem nestled in the hillside of the Hollywood Hills. Bring your bottle of wine and a picnic dinner and enjoy one of the many shows/symphony that are held throughout the year. Accoustics are super- not a bad seat in the house with all different price ranges. Great evening for all age groups.,ffldbeach

40,Good experience,The Hollywood Bowl is something that should be experienced at least once in you life. Make sure to attend an event you really want to see. If you park at a lot in another part of the city and take a shuttle to the Bowl be prepared for a long night. We attended the Mariachi Festival and would not have gotten back to Westwood (near UCLA) until 11:30 if we had stayed for the entire event. We ended up taking the bus back as we weren't up for a long night which was actually fun!,losharoth

The people working there were so plesant and invited us to stay and watch for awhile. We did and really enjoyed it. The venue is nice, with several different picnic areas. It does look like parking might be an issue, as they ""stack"" you in and you can't leave early.",purplejenn11

50,John Williams & David Newman (back to back),"Two nights at the Bowl back to back. Do yourself a favor and park at Hollywood & Highland for $10 and take the $5 round trip shuttle. The food at the Hollywood Bowl is pretty darn good - but you can hit up your favorite market and pack a great picnic into the bowl. Don't forget the wine (but if you forget the wine opener, the Bowl store has them!) Always a great treat, quite pleasant and civilized (choice of concert may affect your experience.)",Lori M
50,What an experience,We were guests during the season of concerts and what a treat. Jazz night on a Wednesday and we got to see B.B. King. OMG.The amphitheatre is a marvel. We were in a 'box' and chose to eat from the 'bowl's' restaurant rather than bring a picnic. We arrived at 6.30 to an already buzzing arena. Atmosphere fantastic. Our server was amazing. Tables had been hooked up and we were offered a cheese plate to nibble with our own champagne. Then came the mixed and Caesar salads. Main course was either chicken (far too much) served with potato and veg or tranche of salmon over Quinoa. All very tasty. Dessert (which we ate during the intermission) was cheesecake or berries.The show was dynamic. Great views of the stage which was beautifully lit. The acoustics were fantastic and the 2 hour show such value. A night under the stars and one to remember. Go if you get the chance. It's truly magical.,Cheryl G
50,An Amazing Venue!,"I recently saw a show at the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood California and I have nothing but the best things to say about it. Driving in and out of the venue was a piece of cake, parking was easy and much cheaper than I anticipated, the walk in was short with much to look at on the way in, the venue staff was huge and helpful, and the venue even had its own marketplace to buy food and wine for the show! This was a great experience all around, the only thing I would suggest is to bring your own food and/wine to the show because those items are a bit overpriced at the venue, as would be expected.",Machai P
50,Iconic Outdoor Events,"We attend the Hollywood Bowl when the LA Philharmonic plays, typically on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Tickets can be had for as little as one dollar, and since it's an LA County facility families bring their own food and picnic on the grounds or in their seats. Programs vary, from classical (Josh Bell, Sarah Chang, Itzak Perlman) all the way to John Williams and Pixar movies to sing-a-longs with movies like Grease or Sound of Music. There is nothing like this, anywhere.On slower nights, people in the 'cheap seats can move down, as thousands of seats remain empty. Parking, which can be stacked on popular nights, is less challenging. But the best deal is to take the Red Line subway to Hollywood and Highland and take the shuttle bus (free with Metro ticket).We come with young musicians, and they come to listen, but this is truly a venue for middle school and up (Pixar and John Williams aside). Small children will get antsy, and it's a lot of walking both up and back.",halobb
30,Very Average Outdoor Entertainment,"We went to the Hollywood Bowl in the beginning of August. we had purchased tickets through a group called GLEH(Gay and Lesbian Elder Housing, which was finally built about 3 years or so ago, as the first Gay and Lesbian Senior Housing Project in the Country).They had a preparty event prior to Seeing Liza Minellii, which we skipped because it was close to 100 degrees and Blazing Hot.When we arrived at the Ticket Counter they said Our Computerized Paper showing 2 seats at about $120 per person would not let us in nor where their tickets on Call. We explained the situation with the manager at the time and he said sorry no ticki no laundry(you know what i mean). Finally after connecting with our group we finally got in (with 7000 seats unoccupied.) As for Liza what can i say she sang New York , New York and Life is a Cabaret Old Chum, seating on a stooland not with great vocals, but it is Liza and there in no one like her(except for maybe Cher, but thats a stretch.).",ThinkingTwice
50,"A Great Night at the ""Bowl""","I've heard of the Hollywood Bowl, seen a few views of it on tv but never expected that it would be so good. We went with family and friends to see John Williams conduct the symphony orchrester.He (in case you don't know) is the composer and director of the musical score from Space Wars, Jaws, and the fanfares of the Olympics, plus many more. The Bowl was sold out for two nights and I was told that it holds 26,000 people.The music was great and the crowed really got into the mood of things by waving lighted, plastic swords that copied the sword fight in the Star War movie. People sang along witht the songs of Fiddler On The Roof and other shows. As I said....""A Great Night at the Bowl"". If you go to La La Land, try to get tickets for one of the shows.",Asphaltkid
50,Outdoor venue for thousands!,"We have been travelling to LA for 17 years, but only now visited the Hollywood Bowl for the first time. We very much enjoy classical music in the outdoors (Tanglewood) or in the indoors (Boston Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra), but this was a different experience. First, the Bowl holds 18,000 people! Second, given the lighthearted nature of the program, folks of all ages attended. Third, the diversity in general of the audience was impressive, and very positive. Fourth, the lovely night air, excellent acoustics, and pleasant surroundings were very positive. Many groups picnicked before the concert. However, getting the car out of the parking lot was a nightmare!",BFBoston
50,John Williams at the Hollywood Bowl,"Every year, John Williams, composer of such delicious film scores as Star Wars, E.T., Jaws, and the first three Harry Potter movies, conducts the L.A. Philharmonic in a concert of his own music at the Hollywood Bowl. I've been twice now, with a group of fellow soundtrack nerds, and I highly recommend this attraction.The Bowl itself is a huge outdoor amphitheater. Bench seating takes most of the space, rising up the hillside. An immense sound system and huge screens give all patrons the full experience. Seat cushions can be rented for a nominal fee, but for a show as popular as Williams' you might want to bring your own if possible. They run out fast.For such a celebrity conductor, the price of tickets is reasonable. My group comes from all over the world for this. Our experience was enhanced this year by a cool selection--the last reel of E.T. playing on the screen, with the orchestra accompanying. It was note-perfect. Beautiful to see this moving film with the Maestro actually present and the Philharmonic's exquisitely talented musicians.At the climax of Williams' shows, he plays the Star Wars theme, and in a really cool Bowl tradition, everyone waves light sabers in time to the music. You can purchase them for $10 at the venue. This year, Duel of the Fates from Ep. IV, the main theme from Ep. I, and the Imperial March gave us three chances to go saber-crazy.Get your butt to the Bowl next time you are in L.A. They offer a one-of-a-kind experience no matter who is onstage.",HogwartsAlum
50,Big Picture,"The Hollywood Bowl is a large amphitheater in Los Angeles, with a summer concert schedule showing a variety of programs. Over Labor Day weekend I went to see the Big Picture, a tribute to Paramount Studios' 100th Anniversary. The program was hosted by Jason Alexander, and it featured some scenes from various Paramount movies over the years, with the musical scores from the movies provided by the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. It was fantastic and phenomenal, with one of the highlights being an appearance by the legendary composer Lao Schifrin talking about how he came upon the original theme to Mission Impossible, the television series that was later adapted for the movies starring Tom Cruise. Parking is always a challenge when going to a ""Bowl"" event, but I suggest going a few block down Highland Blvd., and finding some private (non-stacked) parking. The walk will do you good. As always (and unlike most other concert events), ""Bowl"" events encourage you to bring your own food, wine, snacks, etc. to munch on throughout the program. Bring a sweater as nights can turn a little chilly, and remember to bring a cushion or something soft to sit on as the wooden benches or metal seats can become quite hard after awhile. Most importantly, come prepared to have FUN!",Jose M
50,John Williams,Great evening at the Bowl! John Williams conducted and the Philharmonic played his popular movie soundtracks. Added feature was the playing of the last reel of E.T. Specially packaged for the 30th anniversary of the movie.,Kathy E
50,GO!,"I am so glad we went to the Hollywood Bowl on our trip to L.A. This iconic venue is a must for music lovers. In spite of being in the second to last row, the sound and view were great. We brought binoculars for a close-up view and although it would have been nice to have seats down front, it was still a marvelous experience. We rented the seat cushions for $1, which was a dollar well spent. Having read about the traffic nightmares, we parked at the zoo and took the shuttle, so we didn't have to deal with the traffic-highly recommended! My only regret was that we didn't bring our own food and picnic before the show. The food at the Bowl was good, but the lines were long and prices were expensive.",Laura C
30,Traffic and parking are horrible,"I go to the Bowl at least once a year, whether for the LA Phil, or a pop concert. After the last trip, however, I vowed never to go back. It took an hour and 45 minutes to get there from the west side. Traffic was okay until we got to the La Brea/Sunset Blvd. area. Then we just sat in traffic. Not moving. We were meeting friends for a pre-show ""picnic"" and nobody got there in time to picnic. (Speaking of which, I don't understand why people bring picnic dinners there and sit on the curb to eat. There aren't that many places to picnic; the benches get snatched up quickly, so people end up sitting o the sidewalk, or in their bench seats passing food down the row. Unless you have a box, it's not really fun to picnic here. Anyway, I digress.) When the show was over, we waited in our car for 45 minutes until we could even move because they stack park, and we were stuck in the middle. So after this, we vowed never to come back to the Bowl. And don't tell me I should take the shuttle. I'm not taking the shuttle. Here's a hint, though. We have returned to the Bowl in the mornings for dress rehearsals. At 10 am before the show, they rehearse, and it's open to the public. There is no traffic at this time, and parking is free. We event went to the dress rehearsal of The Producers. You get to sit in the boxes for free. Just bring an umbrella because the sun is pretty intense.",VitalSpring
50,Best of the Summer,"Iconic L.A. This is the best description of the Hollywood Bowl experience. We saw Norah Jones here in August and can only rate this evening excellent. The sound system and monitors make a concert enjoyable from just about anywhere you sit in this almost 18,000 seat amphitheatre. We usually see 5 or 6 concerts each summer and purchase shuttle tickets making getting there and back a cinch. Bring a picnic dinner and a great bottle of wine and you've got an evening to remember.",terrieerlich
50,I love the bowl!,"One of my favorite things to do in the summer is to go to the bowl. There is nothing better then picnicking at the bowl and listening to music under the stars. The bowl has cheap seats too. Yes, they are the ""nose bleed seats"" as every one affectionately calls them but actually the people who sit up there are very friendly and cool. it is a party up in the nose bleed seats! There are big screen TV's so you can see close up even though you are sitting far away.",LincolnInnVT
40,Mozart is Marvelous in the Bowl,"Although my wife and I have been to Los Angeles many times, a trip to a Mozart concert was our first experience with the Bowl -- and it was great. The quality of sound was awesome, and even the ""cheap"" seats were comfortable. I wish the conductor would have given us a narrative about the pieces he had selected for the evening, but other than that, it was excellent in every respect.",Playaman47
50,Amazing Concert,"We went to see Aerosmith here in August and were very impressed by many aspects of the historic Hollywood Bowl amphitheater and dissapointed in others.We were staying overnight in the area so we took a shuttle (only $5 round trip each) from the Hollywood Highland shopping center. Easy to catch shuttle and the drop off location was perfect with minimal up hill walking. The return shuttle trip , however, was an absolute nightmare, with no directional signs and far too many people for the amount of shuttles. We waited almost an hour to catch shuttle , in a huge line of very annoyed people!Very beautiful, lush landscaping all round. Fun , long escalator rides to the top!The concert itself was totally amazing and the sound quality exceptional. The Jumbotron screnes were not working which was a big dissapointment (we did have binocolurs thankfully).The facilities were very nice with easy access to bathrooms and beer/food all around. Beer was $11 each. We had good seats even though they were fairly cheap. The ""ushers"", who I think were volunteer, were very helpful and nice but VERY ""watchful"" for any little disturbance. NO way could you do anything ""illegal"", like smoke any type of anything. There was a drunk girl in front of us who threw up and they promptly escorted her out! The security was in fact, SO tight, we didn't really feel comfortable to even stand up and dance. So that was kind of a mixed blessing. The crowd was Very Well behaved, cuz they HAD to be!Getting out was a complete nightmare, with a crush of people not knowing where to go. My friend , who drove, said it took them over 2 hours to get out of parking lot also.I would totally go again to any concert here, as the positives outwiegh the negatives by far!",kkirwan
50,Juanes was Fantastic,"The Hollywood Bowl is an experience you must have before you die. The theatre seats over 19,000 in various settings, from ""pool"" seats at the stage, boxes in the center, super-saver seats higher up, to benches that allow all to attend the venue. You are allowed to enter several hours before the concert/performance, with your own picnic, drinks, and as much as you want to bring with you (it should fit below your final seats) -- and picnic anywhere in the venue. You can buy food and drink or have it catered directly to your box if you prefer.The acoustics are great, jumbo-tron screens allow you to see the artists up close, and the ""double-cross"" lights above the bowl, keep air-traffic to a minimum. The weather is nearly always perfect, and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra (a slightly smaller version of the Los Angeles Philharmonic) is wonderful. Guest conductors allow for a constant change in style and performance.The Columbia performer, Juanes, was the featured act on Saturday night, with a fireworks finale! What a treat! Perfect weather, perfect setting, perfect music, and fireworks to boot. Only in LA can you have this much fun -- and then take a bus home, while others are waiting for the stacked parking to clear!",Lestertheinvestor
50,Music under the stars,"I've been to LA at least 6 times over the past 20 years and this was my first concert at the Bowl. Absolute highlight of my stay.

You taker escalators up (and down after the concert is over), you can bring your own food & beverages, and the atmosphere is unique.",Carolien K
50,The best value in Los Angeles at this iconic ampitheater,"We regularly attend the Bowl, either with a large group of friends (The Sound of Music Sing-a-Long, Grease!) or with our grandchildren, ages 5 and 3 (Beethoven's 9th). Last week, we went to hear Wuja Wang play Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto #1 with Dudamel conducting the LA Philharmonic. Norah Jones was on the following night. The Go-Gos are coming. I mean, it's SO diverse anyone can find something to see.I seldom pay more than $17 a ticket. You can bring in your own picnics, your own wine. Parking is $12 to $20 or you can shuttle from various locations.It's outdoors, it's cool even on hot summer days, it's beautiful, it's inexpensive, the music is first class. You can usually pick up tickets at the last minute (check first). It's one of the best things to do in Los Angeles (I've only been here 13 years, but so far...).",JillPLosFeliz_CA_
30,Aerosmith with teenagers!!!!!!,"The venue itself is classic, definitely worth the trip (240 miles roundtrip). Parking and traffic were horrible!!!!!! We ended up parking in a weird lot across the 101, walking over a bridge across the freeway and then walking back in the dark. Don't know if I would go back, considering the drive but you have to experience the Hollywood Bowl at least once in your life.",Redpatch7
50,Excellent experience!,"Our trip to the Hollywood Bowl to hear the LA Phil was the absolute highlight of our trip -- even though it was added as an afterthought after months of planning an itinerary! If you are going to be in the area add a visit to your ""must do"" list. The music out under the stars was heavenly. We splurged on garden box seats and dinner served there. You can also order a picnic to pick up or bring your own in! Even bring your own alcohol for LA Phil nights! It was obvious that there were people there in the box seats who do this every week and have their picnics at the ready. Dress warm and bring a blanket. It gets chilly. We stayed at a hotel that allowed us to walk in and avoid the parking which is reportedly awful but it appears that LA has made wonderful arrangements for parking off site. Just review the website. Another note: the bathrooms were incredibly clean. What an experience. Don't miss it!",SESomers
40,Tips for newbie out of towners going to a show,"My husband, son, and I had a great time at the Legends of Reggae show on July 15, 2012. Definitely an iconic LA thing to do! The venue is really neat--a natural amphitheater--and encourages people to eat and drink in the seats. (NOTE: we did not go to the museum.) A few tips for newbie out of towners like us:1. Stay in a nearby hotel so you can walk to and from the show. They stack park everyone and it looked like a nightmare to get out.2. Bring your own food and drink. The least expensive wine was about $36 a bottle (but more like $15 at a store), and most meal items began at $12. The sky was the limit from there. The food was good, but expensive. The super-high prices are the only reason I gave the Bowl 4 stars rather than 5.3. If you choose box seats and don't fill the box (we had 3 seats in a 4 seat box), the Bowl will still sell the remaining seats. We enjoyed the box and meeting a new friend, but next time I'll book us aisle seats in the chairs or benches sections.Go to the Bowl and enjoy!",MidwestMom_11
50,Music under the stars at the Hollywood Bowl,"Even if you can't afford a box seat, you will enjoy listening to all genres of music at the Bowl, under the stars,an outdoor experience not to be missed. You can buy food, bring a picnic, make it a whole summer experience hearing world music, classical music, jazz, pop, Broadway, Hollywood, it all takes place there.A bit of advice, park off-site and either bus or walk to the Bowl. Parking is stacked and slow exiting.",Beverly M
50,Hollywood Bowl over the 4th,This is just the best spot to hear music and watch some fireworks over the 4th. If you stay in the neighborhood you can easily walk back and forth avoiding buses and cars. The Bowl offers food by Patina which you can either order ahead or purchase on the spot. The areas closer to the stage have tables so you can sprea out your picnic and imbibe as well. I saw Barry Manilow who I adore and he was accompanied by the LA Phil!,Mary E
40,Iconic venue for an iconic California band,"Joined 17,000 thousand other disciples to worship at the Wilson/Love altar one more time for their 50th anniversary tour. We Beach Boys fans are definitely getting older and feeling it but have managed to keep in far better shape than the average overweight to obese mall going american. A few walkers and a handful of young kids, else just us faithful, fit but a little grayer. On stage, Brian was better than expected but seemed happy to stay in his room and sing off key most of the night. The endless shilling of CDs and t shirts and the shameless exploitation of the dear departed and everyone's kids was a bit much. But don't be mislead, the concert was great overall.In terms of the Bowl itself, the perennially bad parking situation was barely saved by the shuttles to off sight locales (Hollywood Hyland worked for us). Otherwise, people flow and facilities were exasperatingly inadequate for the crowds. Probably perfect for an evening of classical music. Oh well, maybe next time.",Eric B
40,The Bowl and concert were terrific,"We attended the Beach Boys 50th Anniversity Concert. We have attended numerous concerts here in the past and find the Bowl to be terrific. I would give it 5 stars, but it is always a hassle to get into the bowl even when you arrive early.. we arrived 2 hours early and it still took us forever to get in. We were in the Garden section this time and had a great time. the prices for the food and drinks are reasonable and the outdoor facility is terrific as well... by the way the Beach Boys were great",jturner48
30,"Great Accousitcs, come for the history","Saw a concert here back in October, and had a good time. Our seats were in the back, surprised how little you can see, thankfully they had large tv screens during the performance. If your are seating in the back, prepare for a long walk up many different levels to get to your section. Also dont be fooled by the beer venders right when you get in, they will try selling you beer saying its cheaper with them then inside, where the prices are exactly the same, and they have more of a selection. I would come here again, but would make sure I sat closer to the stage.",Scott H
40,Come during an off day to enjoy the view,"We went to see the bowl on a Saturday morning when there were no concerts scheduled. It was a great way to see the historic landmark in a relaxed way. It's open to the public and you can wander all around the stands. We went and sat with our guidebook to plan the rest of our day. If you wanted to, you could eat lunch in the stands. The public restrooms are very clean and it's a nice place to stop and get your bearings.Recommended route: The bowl is a short distance from Mulholland drive. If it is daytime, start at the Bowl, drive Mulholland westbound and stop at the scenic Bowl Overlook for views of the city. The caveat to this is you want to drive westbound only if the sun isn't setting, otherwise you'll be squinting to see anything. We did the Bowl in the AM, did some other things, then drove Mullholland in the evening eastbound.",jmcke1nd

I highly recommend the Bowl experience - but also recommend parking at one of their off-site locations to be bussed in. Leave a little early to avoid the mass exodus at the end, but in the meantime, savor every moment. Food/drink is available on site, but you can also bring your own (if bringing a picnic basket, only bring plastic utensils bc sharp objects will be confiscated at the security check going in).",rebelbelle14

This is a great opportunity to see local or other artists (sometimes famous) and if you're lucky enough to catch a performance with live fireworks - it's even more fun. We parked at the LA Zoo and took the bus into the Bowl, as driving in can be cumbersome once the show is over.

We take our dinner, wine/beer or champagen, desert... birthday cakes and candles... like we did last Thursday to celebrated my sis-in-law's 60th. Mostly we attend classical, but there are many types of mucis: jazz, rock, blues, etc..

40,Great Place but Horrible parking,Just went to the Playboy Jazz festival this weekend and had a great time. Hollywood bowl is a great place to see a concert. I will find a concert my children will enjoy so they can say they visited a LA landmark. No seat is bad here. Most events they let you bring food and drinks. Even alcoholic drinks depending on the event. The sound is great.. And the bathrooms were clean. The only bad thing is the parking. Horrible. They stack park or tandem park. That is when cars are parked bumper to bumper. There is NO leaving early. You will have to wait for the person in front of you or behind you to leave. So beware. They do offer other alternatives such as shuttle buses. Go to their website. We needed to leave early so we parked in the Hollywood & Highland center. Great!!! $10 bucks and we walked to the bowl. But you can take a shuttle bus from there and I believe it's $4pp going and coming. Again my overall experience was great and will go again especially because we know were to park YaY,necpix

40,Enjoyable Night Out,"We enjoyed at night out at the Hollywood Bowl, in mid-July. We saw the BBC PlanetEarth show, we missed the 1st 3 parts, as we were queuing to collect our tickets from the Will Call Window which had a HUGE queue, we were international customers, and had no choice but Will Call. Anyway that aside, we had good seats, the section behind the Superseats, N2 to the centre on the aisle, a great centre view. The atmosphere was totally different, quite, serene, relaxed, we have previously been to a Rihanna Concert the other night at the Staples Centre, so you can image the change in scenario. The show was enjoyable, not my scene -- but good none the less. We were staying in Burbank, parked at the Universal City Metro Station, got the Red Line to the H&H, and hopped on the free [with valid metro pass] H.Bowl shuttle -- missing all traffic! Good show, would like to see a concert at the Bowl next.",emmaxoxo
50,good night out,"we have just returned from Los Angeles, and going to the Hollywood Bowl was one of the highlights. We took the shuttle bus from hollywood/highland, (free with our metro ticket) arriving early to soak up the atmosphere.The concert we saw was ""Blame it on Rio""with Bebel Gilberto, excellent from start to finish!! The fireworks providing a dramatic finale. We then had a short walk back down to the bus (free again!) and back to Hollywood. Excellent value, and a memorable night.",EnglandAlan
30,We expected more,"We had very high expectations of this event and researched the Hollywood Bowl to death (though it was hard to find information detailed information about the Hollywood Bowl). We couldn't find the time the program would end or when the fireworks would start. We also couldn't figure out how long the program was. We actually had a lot of other things to do and were running late. The last shuttle left a hour before we got to Highland and Hollywood. It was a bit of a walk so we took a cab. It was a maze trying to navigate traffic. As soon as we got there, no one knew when the fireworks would start or how long the show was. We stayed for a couple hours and it started to get cold. We took a taxi ride home just before the show ended. Thank goodness or it would have taken forever to get out of there. If you have a lot of time or want to get there early and bum around, the hollywood bowl is a good attraction. The ambiance is neat, especially if a good singer is preforming. We were in the bleachers and a think a lot of the people there were a bit tipsy. By the way, the fireworks only last about 5 minutes :(All in all, it is a good experiance and something to check out. Pak at Highland and Hollywood mall and walk to the Hollywood Bowl. The shuttle is a bit hard to find but it's all the way at the back. Make sure you ask around. Be ready to spend 4-5 hours there.",brownman
40,"Hollywood Bowl- must see, but not what it used to be...","The Hollywood Bowl is a must see in Los Angeles. It is a wonderful way to enjoy a concert in the open air, and get to see some wonderful performances. However, this year things went wrong during my July 4th concert experience. First of all, the buses used to be a great way to get to and from the Bowl from various locations in the Los Angeles area. I can no longer recommend them. Last year, the charge was $5pp rt from Chatsworth to the Bowl, this year it was $8pp rt. Instead of not allowing people to stand on the bus, they actually encouraged it. I sat at the back of the bus, and the heat from the engine was intense, with hot air blowing on my legs the whole way over, also the was a lack of leg room. Not the experience I have had in the past. I will never take the Bowl bus again.The sound system was also off that night. The music was way TOO loud to be enjoyed. I wished for ear plugs. I have never been to a concert at the Bowl where the music is so loud that you can't enjoy it.As usual, people were talking throughout the performance, and to add insult to injury, the person whom my son gave up his seat on the bus for was included in the party in the row behind us who kicked their full bottle of wine down to our row, causing our feet and bags to get wet. They didn't even say sorry.If you have never been to the Bowl, you should go. Also visit the museum, which is wonderful. As for me, I will going somewhere else next year on July 4th, for the first time since 1994, it will not be the Bowl.",traveltilidrop
50,Quintessential LA,"There's nothing like attending a concert at the Hollywood Bowl on a warm summer evening in LA. I don't know of any where else that has the atmosphere of this place. Picnic baskets are encouraged, if not practically mandatory, as is a good bottle of wine or two. Spread your blanket along one of the many walkways located at the venue and enjoy your food, or dine in your seats. Gaze up at the stars from one of the best vantage points in LA, where the background light is more subdued and the stars can actually be seen in all their splendor.Most concerts are performed either by the world class Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, or the Bowl's own, equally impressive Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, which is comprised largely of musicians that work in Hollywood on film and TV scores. The sound quality is always great, and even though the ampitheater seats 17000 people, I can honestly tell you that there's not a single bad seat.Generally speaking, concerts Monday - Thursday are geared more towards die hard classical musical enthusiasts. Concerts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights tend to be more accessible - often these concerts are themed - 4th of July, Musicals, Movies, music from a particular country, a well known conductor conducting his works, like John Williams, etc. Some of the concerts feature fireworks set to the music, and in my experience they are always extremely well done, though usually smaller in scale than what you might find at a fireworks display somewhere like at a baseball game.Tips for first time visitors: If you have a bench seat, the small fee for a seat cushion is worth it. All the seats are good - views are always unobstructed, but toward the back you may want some low powered (like 6x) binoculars if you want a good view of the orchestra or the performers. Binoculars are available to rent on site.One word of caution - get there by bus or taxi. A bus will be cheaper than the parking fee at the Bowl. There are Hollywood bowl shuttle buses departing from all over the LA area. And, parking at the Bowl has always been a, uh, 'adventure'! :) Its stacked parking, and all the cars have to leave off of the same road. Huge bottleneck - its not untypical to be stuck in the parking lot 30-45 minutes after a concert.",MachThree
40,Quintessential LA Experience,"This is a “must do” during an LA visit. Sitting under the stars, watching an event, on a warm Southern California evening gives you a glimpse into the area’s attraction. Having read all of the previous reviews about ticket costs, conditions, etc, I can say they are accurate. However, if you go with the right attitude, you will enjoy yourself. We did not have the best tickets and as a result, were a distance from the stage. The acoustics are good, so we had no complaints. There are numerous large screens around the venue so you do “see” what is going on.We saw the season opening night where Sir James Galway, Liza Minnelli and B. B. King were inducted into the Bowl Hall of Fame. The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra accompanied their performances. The event was flawless, a treat for the eyes and ears. Of special note was the finale, which included a fireworks display.You may wish to check out the rules on bringing in alcohol, as they vary per event. The website is a good place to start.A note on parking, parking at the Bowl is “stack”. In other words, you park nose to tail with everyone else in your row. This means you will not be able to make a hasty entrance should you want to. We took about 45 minutes to get from our seats, to the car and out onto the road in front of the Bowl. This wasn’t bad, but if you are a big “Type A” personality, you may want to look into an alternative. There are shuttles from selected places in the metro area and some private lots near the Bowl. You can make some advance parking arrangements through Ticketmaster.",basicgrandpa
40,Great Museum to Learn More about the Hollywood Bowl and its History!,"This is a small, but wonerful museum on the name shows, concerts, and history of the Hollywood Bowl. You can listen to past concerts, view short films/tapes on events, and learn more about the area. Many name Hollywood acts have gone through the area. The best time to see the museum before going to the Hollywood Bowl for a summer concert. Admission (or at least it was summer 2006) free; its a delightful way to spend 30 -45 minutes to learn more about the place. Perfect evening would be seeing the musuem, bringing along your picnic lunch and wine, and listening to a summer concert.",mini
40,"Great event; Shame on Patina, though","We went last night to AFI's THE BIG PICTURE which did a countdown of the top 25 Hollywood Musicals of all time. The event itself was wonderful. We splurged on Terrace box seats and it was soooo much more comfortable than the Super Seats or benches. I managed to find box seats on Craig's List a week beofre the show and they were wonderful (box 1729).We made the mistake of ordering food delivered to our box by Patina. I wanted to splurge and not to lug food up the hill, but don't do it. Really don't. The quality was poor (wilted salad, dry chicken and drier vegeatble, stale bread); the dessert was fair, but then what can you do to Angels food cake and blueberries?!?!? And all at a hefty price. The worst was the service; abrupt, haphazard and vociferously rude in questioning my minimal tip. Very embarassing and marred an otherwise gorgeous night under the stars. Honest, don't do it. Bring some Whole Food goodies or let Gelsons make you a picnic basket. Although I didn't expect 5 star restaurant service, this was WAY WAY below par.The show was great; Mauceri was suave; we took the Ventura shuttle and it was efficient and we look forward to next year (minus Patina dinner!).",Pupsweet
50,What a night!,"Just returned to England from touring in the States. This included staying in LA and a visit to the Hollywood Bowl. It was a Saturday night in July and we were staying just 15 minutes walk away. We had no tickets, but decided to walk up there and see what was available.The Sound of Music was on that night and what an incredible sight met us. There were so many people arriving in buses, cars and just walking (I understand that it seats about 17,000 people and that night was a sell-out). People were having picnics on every available space.We went to the box-office, not expecting to get a seat, and to our absolute amazement the ticket seller said that two seats had been returned on the front row just behind the second lot of boxes. They were not expensive and we jumped at the chance to purchase them. We were not very far back.What a night - the spectacle of that evening will be with me for the rest of my life - 17,000 people singing The Star Spangled Banner on a lovely, warm LA evening was tremendous.The show was a wonderful experience I shall treasure forever.Do experience it!",travkay
50,A true LA experience,"You haven't lived in LA or visited LA until you've gone to the Hollywood Bowl. The experience is just as good in the bench seats as it is in the boxes. And as the previous reviewer noted, most of the boxes are purchased by the season holder, high-society elite of LA. Unless you are with a group of 4 and have a box to yourself, it is not a good idea to get a box seat. Bench seats are further back, but a lot cheaper and just as much fun. Definitely get there early with your picnic dinner, and bring a blanket and hot chocolate (or wine) for when the sun goes down and it gets chilly.Parking is a pain. There are park and ride shuttles that will allow you to avoid the hastle and expense. See (--)",VC1850
20,"GREAT venue, however...","I was 'fortunate' enough to secure a great seat to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl late last month (August) and can provide the following insight.I have been to MANY different concert venues and this is definitely worth checking out! On a (typical) warm sunny So. Cal. evening it is hard to beat. I really like the fact that you can either bring your own food and beverages in ('picnic'), or purchase them inside at one of the numerous (and very expensive) vendors. The sound quality was great, the view outstanding and the whole history and feel of the place was really very cool!Now, a note to the 'uninitiated'...Prices are high, but for the experience it is probably worth it - once. If buying tickets online (as I did), you may get an amazing seat BUT be forewarned. If you get into a box seat the others surrounding you probably have a subscription to a series of concerts, or else have a friend who has provided them with tickets. What this means is that while you may have gone to great lengths to see a specific entertainer, the other 4 or 5 individuals in the box may simply be there for an evening out since the seats are already paid for. In my case, the others in the box didn't even know who was actually playing that evening, and were only there to be 'seen', have dessert, catch up on gossip, etc. It was pretty uncomfortable being the only one 'into' the music while the rest of the group tried to carry on a conversation around me... The box seats are actually just fold-up camping chairs, crowded into a small space which is very difficult to get in or out of, especially when the tables are up (before the show) and people are eating. I did end up going to the very top of the bowl (take the escalators!) and found the view to be absolutely incredible, especially with the 'HOLLYWOOD' sign in the background. The people in these (equally) uncomfortable bench seats are much more genuine, and there for the show - not to show off. Much more affordable in the nosebleeds too, but really pretty far from the stage.Also, for those coming from out of town, stay at a nearby hotel/motel (which are not cheap), and forget the parking hassle. It's brutal!An amazing venue that really should be experienced, but take the above into consideration.",Nomad28574
10,The bowl has seen much better days!,The Tango night was a mixed bag at best. The first three numbers were enough to lull most customers into a nice snooze only to wakened by the very early intermission. Hmm...Half an hour later the main program got underway and if it hadn't been for the talented tango dancers the evening would have been a bust. The orchestra was not utilized very effectively...I bet the musicians felt that way as well and wondered why they had to be there.I am also disappointed by the very shabby state of the bowl. Does anyone care? And at the price of the tickets there must some money left over to buy a little paint!So I won't buy any season tickets until this whole experience will improve. Good Luck.,Voyager1614
