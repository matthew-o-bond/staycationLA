40,Good production,"The Theater: Small but intimate. They sell snacks and drinks in the lobby. $1 or donations.The Show: ""Men Covets Bird"". Two men show, Richard & Roger. Very interesting show!! They full use the walls in the theater, using projectors to add in more graphics. Love the way they direct this show, very unique. Both performers are fantastic!! They act, sing & even play music instruments. Very talented!!The Parking: They have a parking lot right across street, $5. Side street residential area, free parking, 24th street might be tough to find a spot, try 25th street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
