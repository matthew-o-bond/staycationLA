40,Great slides close to the beach,Such a nice park close to the beach. It has three slides with different sizes and then my son can enjoy all of them. The only setback is that the shoes will be full of sands and in the winter time is not the best to go to. But for kids is really worth spot to relax.,Dewi Erawan
20,Patch of grass by the beach,Itâ€™s pretty small and has nothing except for some benches and palm trees - unless maybe the small playground on the other side of the cafe is included. Some beach bathrooms and a car park are right next. Might be good if you want to rest on some grass.,mrdom
40,Not great for tourist but good enough for a family visit,"I must say, I do not have kids so take this advice/review with a grain of salt. I came here by mistake, walking back to the airport (just walking really, had several hours to kill) when I stumbled upon this park.It has this feel of beachside, greenery and perfect spot to chill out if it wasn't bloody hot. Looking around you can see lots of parents with their children, either riding their bikes, playing with a ball or just skating makes it pretty interesting. Lots of people to be honest. The park is well maintained and with a bench here and there, it manages to tempt you into staying a bit longer.I wouldn't recommended to any tourist as... well, a regular park is a park, but if you have a couple of hours to kill and you came to visit Santa Monica and found yourself here, why not stay for a bit longer?My only regret of coming to this park is not having my bicycle with me, I would've loved to ride it around.",rodrigoelp
40,Family Fun,This is a great place on the beach to enjoy the entire family and relax in the sun. If you like to people watch this is a place to do it. There are plenty of restrooms in the park and as with all tourist attractions like a beach or park there are some beach dwellers but they do not bother you if you don't bother them. Overall we enjoyed our visit and plan to return when we take our next trip.,MzProdigi
40,Family friendly park,"Excellent outdoor space to take the family, meet locals, bring pets and enjoy the beach. Every visit is different.",SMOgal
50,Great family place,This beautiful beachfront park is great for small children with lots of toddler friendly equipment. the beach is right there and there is also food and bicycle rental available.,Jgoldchain
30,Nice to eat lunch here.,"Spent an hour or so here, very nice place to sit and have some lunch and just watch as the people go about bike riding, skating and jogging by. Very safe family oriented place.",our56
50,Kids have fun & you have a view of the ocean!,"This is a great family-oriented park. There is a restroom nearby. There are benches for parents to sit on. Santa Monica does not allow individuals without children in to any of their park areas (they all have a fence or perimeter around them). Lots of bicyclists, skaters, and pedestrians going by ... and a wonderful view of the ocean.",calgal405
