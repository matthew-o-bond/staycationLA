10,Musuem of Dream Space,I was very disappointed in this place! There were only six rooms to visit which took all of 15 minutes. It was definitely overpriced for what you received. Don’t waste your time with this experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acormier12
10,Please skip,"Put this in prospective. The Museum of Modern Art charges $25 and you can spend all day there. This “museum “ costs $30 and if you take your time, you will be done in 15 minutes. The lights nice but the place is a real rip off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmorelli39
30,More of a photo op than a museum,"We paid for the VIP package which, in hindsight, was unnecessary. We were in and out in just under an hour. The rooms were pretty and made for fun places to take pictures but the location is pretty small and after you take a few pictures there isn't anything else to it. Calling it a museum seems a little misleading. It seems like the whole thing should be an exhibit in a real art or photography museum rather than an independent experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalMomOfTeens
