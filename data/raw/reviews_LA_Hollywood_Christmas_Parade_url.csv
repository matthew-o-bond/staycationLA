20,Kids lost interest,"I love Christmas and was super excited for this parade. It was easy to get to and we found a good viewing spot easy. With the museums close by, it was easy to entertain the kids while we waited for the parade to start... It was an hour late! The fire trucks helped to brighten their spirits by throwing out stuffed animals, but that was the only fun thing about the parade. There were long pauses between bands and floats. We didn't stay to see Santa at the end - the kids had fallen asleep on the ground out of boredom. Super disappointing. The only good thing was seeing Mario Lopez.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydream622572
30,It was alright,"A friend and I just happened to be in hollywood this day and planned our day to stay and watch the parade. We got to hollywood bvld around noon and people were already sitting on the sidewalk üò≥ but i dont think it was necessary. We ended up ‚Äúrenting a chair‚Äù for $5 from a ‚Äúturtoring‚Äù place and it wasnt bad although it was across from one of the scientology buildings and we realized the money we ‚Äúdonated‚Äù for the chair went to a scientology tutoring thing üôÑ. Anyways it seems that a big sponsor of the parade is scientology. There were long pauses in between floats, lots of cars with current soap opera actors. I figured the singers from the red carpet would have came down the parade too but they didnt. We could have gone without seeing the parade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtneyf522
20,The Tree Parade,One of the worst parades I have been too. The roadies decided to put the cart with tress right in front of us trying to watch. It was supposed to start at 5 but an hour and a half later and it still had only just started to begin. What a drag. All we saw was trees. Meesa thinks the star wars sequels are better than this trash. This was absolutely horrible. Only consider going if you are convinced enough to pay for seats (which sell out quickly) or have a seat that is up in balcony overlooking the street. Wow Meesa disappointed. 1.5/5 - PoorPhotos of our excellent viewing area are attached.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JarJarBinksEats
20,Don't expect a parade,"This event is much better seen on TV. A few truths I learned along the way:This is not a live broadcasted event. It is prerecorded and sewn together to air at a later date. It is a staged event. It does not flow like other parades. They have grand stand seating were groups perform and interviews take place. The performance area can not be seen by anyone without tickets.If you sit or stand to see the staging areas or parade more it is more of a trickle. NOT your typical live parade. For example, wewere standing less than a block upstream of the grand stands and the KOST host passed us by in the staging area and headed to the grand stands. At least 20 mins later he moved about a half block and still had not reached the grand stands.Overall we went to see our daughter perform and followed the route to do so, so happy about that, but we did not stay for more of the parade. While waiting we got to see a few stars in the staging area in cars like The Village People and Wally & The Beav. :)Oh and one more item of bad news. The ""parade"" was at least a half hour late starting. I would save my efforts for the Rose Parade :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831charb
30,Could have been better,"This has been my 3rd time at this parade. This time I bought seat tickets on the Red Carpet. This was fun. There was a concert before the parade that was great. They had one entertainer after a other for one hour.First up was Olivia Newton John and she sang great, the last entertainer was Cindy Lauper and she was also great. I fact all of them were outstanding. This was all being televised and they would not start the parade until everyone was seated. First came huge balloon which made you feel that you were at the Macy Parade. The disappointing thing was that there was only two floats, the rest of the parade was bands and they were all from Georgia, there was only one local band. There was also plenty of horses and they were beautiful and some celebrities in cars. None of the celebrities they mentioned in there advertisement was there. The parade had a Scientology overtone. There children were passing out fliers, carrying balloons and just generally walking in the parade. It was very cold and windy and watching them try to control the balloons was funny. However there was one float with Ron L. hHubbard's name all over it, so if I knew that the parade was put on by the Scientologist I would not have gone. The parade used to be very good with lots of celebrities, floats and many local as well as out of state bands. With this all said I was very disappointed in this parade and probably will not go again. But the concert was fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zenakitty1
30,Totally kitschy which makes it lovable,"This parade happens regularly around the thanksgiving holiday. This has a unique LA flavor to it plenty of B movie stars from the soaps are in this parade, and always get a number of the cars from past movies never fail to see the batmobile. Also, there has to be a stream of oversized balloons in this parade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,A Classic Christmas Celebration,"This is as close to a hometown parade as you will get in Los Angeles. Horses, television and movie personalities, bands and drill teams are topped off by the grand finale--Santa! Well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
