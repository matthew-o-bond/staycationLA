40,Early hike to beautiful LA views.,"Shortest hike to see the Hollywood sign. Get there early because parking can be tricky, specially on weekends.We arrived at 7:30 AM and were able to park at the Griffith observatory lot, it's free until 10 AM. The start of the trail is right off the parking lot, easy in the beginning, but for me, a rookie on hiking, it was challenging but doable, it took us approximately 1 hour to get to the top, nice views, Hollywood sign can be seen but far away. We took an unofficial short cut on the way down, and by 9:30 AM we were back at the car. Bathrooms are available at the parking lot as well as water fountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joinville
