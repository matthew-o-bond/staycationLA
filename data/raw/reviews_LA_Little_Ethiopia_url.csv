40,Great walking distance side trip to another world when visiting LACMA museum district,"Little Ethiopia is a block long foreign country nestled 1/4 mile from Wilshire Blvd down S. Fairfax Ave in LA. Numerous restaurants, small exotic groceries offering Ethiopian textiles, spices, raw green and roasted coffees, incense and other goodies you are not likely to find anywhere else in LA. An easy walk from LACMA, the La Brea Tarpits, and Peterson Auto Museums - with a quick visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eheyman
50,Neighborhood Gem,"This small city block on Fairfax is awesome. The location is great because of the nearby hot spots like The Grove, Century City, and Beverly Hills just to name a few. The shops and restaurants are all authentic and full of friendly people. I have been to three of the eateries in Little Ethiopia and love them all. The culture and history are interesting and this is a nice little area to become more familiar with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javieraM9241VA

40,Queen of Sheba in LA ...,"This is where she'd be, in the quaint little ethnic neighborhood of Little Ethiopia near central town Los Angeles.

Nice aside when looking for that something different to do. Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed

50,Little Ethiopia Restaurant in Little Ethiopia,"The BEST Ethiopian food in Little Ethiopia in Los Angeles, you have to try it. The veggie combo and the meat combos are great! They have the best and most tender lamb. Their food is VERY authentic Ethiopian food! The service is GREAT and the people are fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Violet7773
40,A little seedy but far from a slum,"Not far from Miracle Mile, but also near low rent districts full of other immigrants, is Los Angeles' Ethiopian neighborhood. It's not just a tourist attraction, but where Ethiopian-Americans tend to settle. But it is a tourist attraction, too. If you want Ethiopian food in LA, this is not the only place you can go, but it's the obvious place and there are plenty of restaurants and plenty of stores selling tourist stuff you won't need to fly to Ethiopia to buy. Another American immigrant ethnic neighborhood in the great American tradition of immigrant ethnic neighborhoods. Check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danjuma
