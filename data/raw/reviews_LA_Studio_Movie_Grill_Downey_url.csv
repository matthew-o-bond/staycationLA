10,First & last time,"Worst theater ever! It's my first and last time coming into this theater. Bathrooms are disgusting filthy dirty. No toilet paper, no napkins to dry your hands no seat covers and trash all over the floor. At the entrance it says no kids under 5years to enter to watch any rated R movies but they allow newborns crying inside the actual theater room on a rated R. Worst place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dessl2017
