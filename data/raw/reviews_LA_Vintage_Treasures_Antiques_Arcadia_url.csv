30,The vintage items are fun and the prices reasonable,"But for some reason, the owners just don't care if you buy something or not. When I asked a simple question about an article, the owner (female) gave me a short, terse answer and walked off. If there wasn't a really nice place to eat, I would have just left the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
10,JUNK - Do NOT Shop here- Cops were called on a Paying Customer,"THE WORST ! DO NOT SHOP HERE !!! I was happy to pop in as I love thrifting & vintage shopping and I live close by - The owner seemed nice enough. I Purchased a piece of furniture & a dress, after we agreed on a price, I Paid in cash & as I was About to load it into My car - I was Told it was No Longer For Sale ??? & Then a phone was shoved in my face - to talk to the daughter of the owner . She began saying it was no longer for sale and she didnt get enough money for it? I Tried to refuse my money back ( as I had already paid , and I wanted my item) The Daughter Burst in the room with Highlight folis in her hair and begins screaming and cursing at me ""Get the F*** out of my store was uttered more then once ) Then THEY CALLED THE COPS !!!! On a Paying Polite customer - NEVER Ever will I shop here … & You shouldn't either ! I did get my $ back ( It was Thrown in my Face !) So Rude & Unprofessional . I was Speechless . They are CRAZY people . I wish I could attach an auto file - my husband recorded her screaming at us … I coudn't make up a story like this !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175jennyk
50,Great new store!,"I stumbled across Vintage Treasures the other day and spent a lot more time in it than I had planned. Not only was it filled with exactly the type of things its name implies, the people working there were just lovely! The eclectic array of vintage and antique items is great - I found little gifts for lots of people in my family. Parking is limited on the street but there's a lot in the back. Then after shopping try out the pizza place next door. Totally worth the stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796carrieb
