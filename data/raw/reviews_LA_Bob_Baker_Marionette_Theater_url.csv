50,A national treasure right in Los Angeles,"We took our 2 year old granddaughter to the Halloween Spooktacular - it was wonderful! Children from 10 months to 12 years old were riveted, and all of the grown up loved it, as well! The puppeteers are world class. we plan on going back for their Holiday show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verymushme1
50,A Gem in Los Angeles,"Hate that it took so long for us to actually go see a show. Now, we are big fans. After seeing the Nutcracker in Pasadena and a revival of the original show at their new home theater, we cannot wait to see more shows. The talent and artistry of the team is incredible. The shows",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emb5000
50,A MUST if you are visting LA,"You must visit this magical place, especially if you are visiting LA with kids. It's truly amazing. We went there at 7pm on Monday and my 4yr old was sleepy and tired when we arrived. As the show started he was fully energized and was enjoying all the performances. Lots of…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SP_ORD
50,Magical & Nostalgic!,Bob Baker is one of the best theatre experiences in L.A. This is a great place to bring children or just your own inner child. I highly recommend this to experience some old school enchantment!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostinlalaland2018
50,Nothing Else Like It!!!,"I don’t know what took me so long to visit Bob Baker Marionette Theatre! It has been on my la bucket list since I moved here over 12 years ago! Well I finally went and took my son and we had a blast! First off, there’s literally nothing else like it, so it gets cred right off…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Low tech entertainment,The 55-year-old marionettes have been brought back at Bob Baker Marionette Theater for “Enchanted Toyshop.” The children (and adults) are mesmerized by the marionettes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
50,Wonderful experience for the little AND big people!,"We took our 4-year-old granddaughter to the “Enchanted Toyshop” marionette show at Bob Baker Marionette Theater. Children sit on the carpet, the adult handlers go unnoticed to the children, whose FULL attention is on the various marionettes. After the show, my granddaughter wanted her own marionette, which she handled in front of a Dracula marionette. A good time was had by all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak419
50,Kids loved it; adults too,"I wasn’t sure what my video game and SFX movie loving kids would think of an old time marionette show but they loved it! They got to sprawl on the floor as hundreds of elaborate, creative puppets pranced around, sometimes flouncing into their laps. Adults had fun too, amazed by the craft and care that obviously went into this. And after, a surprise backstage ice cream party! Huge hit and culturally educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joryn1
50,Refreshingly analog with lots of heart,"I've been to Bob Baker a handful of times, once without any kids present (I took a friend to try and convince him to do a documentary on the theatre!) and I always love it.Allergy sufferers beware: there is a healthy layer of dust coating everything, however, it kind of adds to the charm of the location. It's like those people who like their antiques dinged because it adds to the character.The production is (as I call it) ""refreshingly analog."" You are not overwhelmed with information, which allows you to fully enjoy and process what you see. I always love watching the puppeteers. The movements that they make to animate the marionettes are so complex, and yet they manage it beautifully.My favorite show is by far the NUTCRACKER. It's so fun to see how they do it differently from the traditional show. I especially love the dance of the flowers that is their grand finale.After the show, you are awarded to little cups of ice cream in a room that feels a bit like an old-fashioned ice cream parlor.I love this place and hope that it's always here. Good for people of all ages. If you want to make a day of it, picnic at Vista Hermosa park a block to the east. I'll write a review for that park now.Wishing you love and romance,Aviva Vaughnauthor of slow burn women's fiction inspired by food, travel, and Jane Austen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvivaVaughnAuthor
50,A Hidden Gem!,"I had an opportunity to take a tour of Bob Baker's Marionette Theater; and I was amazed at the number of Marionettes on display backstage. Alex Evans is the head Puppeteer of this venue; and has different storylines and different marionettes for each. For children and adults alike. Ice cream is offered after the show. Make a point of visiting this historic theater, while in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845lynnel
50,Must see with kids,This beautiful little place has been around forever. Kids and adults love it. It is rare to see such beautifully created puppets and the performers are very professional.We have celebrated numerous birthday parties at this venue over the years. This is a great experience and every Angelino should go. They have parking. You cannot bring in food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
30,Good for Kids,"Many years ago I saw a marionette show. The marionettes performed on a stage with the puppeteers above them. You never saw the puppeteers during the show. It was a play done with marionettes. It was very well done and very professional. That's what I thought this was going to be.I guess a little more research should have been done. This is more a marionette show for children.It's really not a show for adults.This being said if you have children, by all means bring them. I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves.You do have to pay for parking. The theater is not in the nicest of neighborhoods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4264SYmarkb
40,Great Fun for Children (and adults),"We took our granddaughter, age 6, to see the marionette show. She was unsure about it when we got there - as were we. Yes, the building looks old and the area is somewhat run down. Once inside, we had a great time. The staff was very nice. The show was the original one from 1953 when the theater opened. Though dated as far as songs, etc., the children enjoyed it. The puppets moved around the theater and came right up to the children - and a few adults. The puppets sat on the kids' laps, touched their hair, etc. The kids laughed and had a great time. After the show, everyone was invited in to another room for ice cream. Given all of the computer toys, videos, etc. that children have today, it was wonderful to see them enjoying this simple but fun puppet show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774jeromet
30,Dirty,"A well meaning, beloved institution for sure, but sorely in need of a cleaning. It has dust on the curtains and light fixtures that looks like it's been there since the 50's! CLEAN, Bob Baker people. Please. Take care of the facility. Between that and the dirty carpet, it feels old. also needs to upgrade the sound system. It's very hard on the ears and I think lends to discomfort with the kids as it feels old, and a little creepy. Wonderful puppets, some good (some not so good) puppeteers. It could be great, but it feels tired and rundown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j0urneymanj
40,Rarely seen classic art form!,"While the venue is very outdated, it's o.k. because you feel like you are going back in time. Real marionette theater is almost gone and this place deserves to be kept going and supported. The show was magical. I heard that many Angelenos had their birthday parties here over the last 50 years. Keep this art alive!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDNative92116
50,Very cute!,"We loved it! Took my nieces and nephews , ages 2 ,4, and 5 yr. old. It was a different experience for them and they want to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelamG2350VW
50,Wonderful real puppet show that has been around for more than 50 years,"We love Bob Baker Marionette. It is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago when I first attended a birthday party there. I remember being in awe and loving the show and my kids (8 and 9) still love to go. We started going when they were around 2 and 3 years old. It is near Downtown LA and they have free parking. The show starts at 2:30 but kids love to run around on the ""stage"" before it starts. The show is beautiful and the puppets interact with the children. If you have a birthday, they do a special thing during the show (my daughter had her birthday here a couple of years ago). They give free ice cream to all the kids after the show. It is a wonderful experence and I highly recommend it. We were also very satisfied with the birthday party and everyone was very impressed with the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
40,Wish I had discovered it sooner,"Yes, it is a blast from the past, but that is a good thing. Updating it would kill it anyway.It is far enough in the past to be it's own world.If you enjoy watching the old claymation Rudolph tv special during the holidays, you will enjoy this. Same era and level of charming.If you have little ones, they can sit in on the floor in front. Marionettes walk right up to them and even sit in their laps.These marionettes are the super-complex ones with a dozen strings or more each. It is fascinating to watch. They even sled and ice skate and dance.The show is an hour, but it flew by.Kids up to age 9 will love it. My 10 year old boy enjoyed it too, but he does think puppetry is cool.Admittedly it is best for preschoolers and primary schoolers.They serve ice cream to the whole audience after the show, which is cute, and if you ask, the puppeteers will show you some techniques.They have a gift shop of course.Now the building is terribly run down and evidence of past glory is now well-faded and dusty. But that said, it was still a packed house.Warning about parking. If you an park in the lot across the street under the freeway ramp, it is free. Do that if you can. If you park in the lot adjacent to the theatre you have to pay cash. You put 3 dollars cash into an envelope and write your parking space number and license plate #on it. Then seal it and put it in the slot. (There is a kiosk where you can get the envelopes and a slot for the finished payment to be deposited. But you need to find your own pen). They do check during the show. The theatre doesn't own the parking lot. If your spot doesn't have a spot number, look to either side and count.... It is awkward.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/219jd
40,Cute,We oldsters like good puppet shows. It was definitely for the kiddys but cute.The players had had to devote months to learn the routines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanettaS26
50,Take Your 3-7 Year Old for a Great Afternoon,"This is a wonderful family experience. The show is an hour long, the perfect length, and afterwards everyone gets ice cream. The puppets are very well made and the puppeteers are all extremely professional. The show changes according to the time of year, this show was about farm animals.Very fun happy music. The children are very well entertained. They sit on the carpet and the puppets come right up to them. You'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyO22
50,A must visit for families with young children.,Definitely off the beaten path but we were so glad to discover this little gem.A magical show of beautifully crafted marionette puppets. We all found the experience very enchanting and highly enjoyable. The children sit on the floor to watch and the puppets come up and interact with them which they thought was wonderful and at times very funny.We went to see a show during the week and our tickets were $10. The show ran for just the right amount of time and after the show we were treated to free ice cream. They also had marionette puppets for sale which we purchased.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyMaze
