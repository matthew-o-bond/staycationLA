50,Great For Mt. Bikes,This is not and easy bike ride but worth the effort. On a clear day the views are amazing. Bring lots of water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/425stanleyr
50,Breathtaking View!!!,"I love this trail, very convenient, right around the corner, busy often time... worthy to visit!!!It has a very charming historic scene, we can picnic in the grounds, easy access and great workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadorro7
50,Great,"This is a really great spot for a hike, and it's historic to boot. The grade is gentle enough that hiking here is do-able for people of all ages, and if it's clear, there are great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
40,Good Half Day Hike,"A very good hike through the lower San Gabriel Mountains. The trail switches back and forth as you wind up the mountain to the top of Echo Mountain where there are remnants of an old hotel and some railway relics. The hike took us about 2.5 hours up and back. In April, there were some wild flowers still blooming. There were also lots of lizards and a snake. On a clear day(LOL) the views are expansive. We had some haze but still enjoyed being up high. The hike starts at the top of Lake Avenue. Walk through the old gates and hang right until you get to a dry ravine. Skirt along the top left side of it and across what looks like a dam and then follow the trail up. Bring plenty of water as there is none along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuHermosaBeach
50,Mt. Lowe,The trail is tranquil and well maintained. There is a nice elevation change to challenge your physical fitness if hiking quickly but gradual enough for a leisurely stroll up the mountain. Bring plenty of water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510JR
50,Hiking Echo,"I love hiking this trail. You get a great workout and at the top of Echo mountain, you get a history lesson on the great hostel that was once there! I wish it was still there, it would've been a great place to stay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannedS2508NZ
50,Mt Lowe Railway Trail to Mt Lowe Tavern site,"A hidden jewel of a trail with a (+4000') elevation gain in 6.8 miles.Walkable and bikeable. You must come prepared for sun, shade, rain or snow. Bring water, can be done as a long day hike or an overnighter. Can also be a backdoor to Mt Wilson. This trail overlooks the Grand Canyon of the San Gaberials and offers 180 degree views of Los Angeles and the islands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
50,A great workout and history up at the top of Mount Lowe,I started this hike at Sam Merrill Trail off of Loma Alta Drive. The hike is about 5.8 Miles round trip to the top of Mount Lowe Railway with about 1400 ft elevation change . This hike has a nice steady incline all the way up so bring at least a liter bottle of water and a snack(there are some picnic tables at the top). The view up top is really nice but the real treat is seeing all the remains of Mount Lowe and reading about the history up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rannko
30,Built solid as an Interstate and about as busy,"If you live in the Altadena area, this trail is a must. Also known as The Lower Sam Merrill Trail, it's a beautifully graded, solidly reinforced and, for the last 10 years, rigorously maintained. Good thing. Because of the local geology is fractured composed of fractured rock, the trails of the San Gabriels require constant maintenance, If you compare the trail up Echo Mtn to others in the area, the difference is dramatic. e.g. The once glorious Sunset trail is badly overgrown with poison oak and severely rutted from mountain bikers. But the best part of the trip up Echo mountain is the trails above the old hotel. For example take the hike up the middle Sam Merrill trail over the ridge to the oak forests and a majestic view of the local 'grand canyon.' (sadly this trail has also become damaged by mountain bikers and a bit dicey at times.) Best yet... once your past the hotel, the crowds are gone and there's a genuine wilderness up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/216kennethm
40,A Good Pretty Easy Hike,"The Sam Merrill Trail is easy to find...go north on Lake Avenue from Pasadena through Altadena until Lake stops. You are at the trail head. This is a pretty easy walk on a hard packed trail that gets you to the top of Mount Lowe. there was a hotel, tennis courts, etc. and an electric railway that ran until the late 30s. A nice hike if you have a few hours. I am told that it is mobbed on weekends. Parking on the street after 6am...better get there early on a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrinceConsort
50,Best hike in the San Gabriel Valley,"This is an easy hike for most people, with a great reward at the top... great views of the LA basin and the ruins of a hotel complex that was here over 100 years ago. Bring water and don't go in the middle of a hot day, and you will have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8014LXbillb
50,A Trek Back in History,"We are fortunate to live close to this trailhead, which takes hikers to the historic ruins of an old hotel at Echo Mountain and remains of the Mt. Lowe Railway. Yes, you should be a hiker in fairly good shape (it's just shy of 3 miles each way), but I would classify it as moderately difficult. From Echo Mountain, you can take several trails that lead to Inspiration Point and ruins of another hotel, Alpine Tavern. Make a day of this hike, and you'll be rewarded with beautiful views of the San Gabriel Valley and a lot of Altadena history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennislynnee
30,Really good exercise.,"This is simply a hard trail, though very popular. It is the 405 of hikes.Get there early in order to park. Go in a group to improve your parking chances.The trail itself has little to recommend it. It is not in itself pretty. It is in the sun most of the day (again, get there early). The views are very nice.It is about 2.5 miles one way. It can be crowded, sometimes very much so. At the top is the abandoned My. Lowe Railroad, and it is fun to read about it and see the relics.If you want the training, this is great. If you like hiking for other reasons, find other hikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkane8
40,You gotta be a hiker.,"You will be hiking up. And up, and up! You should be in good shape and packing water with you. I have never made it all the way up. My guess would be 4 or 5 hours. I go for one or two hours and drink 4 bottles of water. I have a grand time doing just that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
50,Easy trail/fire road hike up the hill,Easy to moderate hike up the hill...If you're not too outa shape.Simple hike up the hill if you hike a bit. Round trip is probably 5-6 miles.I've always continued on up to Inspiration Point (doubles the distance but way fun)Train/tram history is amazing. Gets crowded on the weekends but weekdays are great.El Patron Restaurant is just down the hill for post hike food and refreshments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Good exercise.. Too much dirt,We went on this trail this Saturday morning. We got there at 8am and there were already plenty of people there. The temperature was pretty cool because the trail is on the cool side of the mountain so in the early morning there was enough shade. The trail is 2.5 miles one way but the elevation is about 1km so it's a good exercise. My only complaint was that there's too much dirt on this trail. At the end of hiking my pink sneakers were yellow because of the dirt... But it was a lot of fun. And make sure that you take your four leg friends with you:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey39259356879
40,Invigorating,Went hoping to see lots of Spring wildflowers but either the drought got in the way or our timing was off as there weren't that many. Great trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,My favorite LA Hike,"I have hiked this trail numerous times since the mid 70's. So easy to get to - at the end of Lake Blvd. Very well maintained trail. After an hour or so you are visiting the past. A tram used to go up to this ""mountain resort"" which is now in shambles but a great place to eat lunch in the shade and with a view of the city below. Bring water - it can be hot on a warm summer day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventure_Debi
50,The Cobb estate,"Overall this is a great spot for a hike, and pic's of the city below. I have heard of groups coming up there during Halloween for SÃ©ance. Walking up there at night is also fun, Just don't get caught and take a flashlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayMac82
50,A trip back in time,"I have hiked this several times in the past 25 years. Love the history, which is lacking in California. Best hiked in the late fall, winter or spring when it is cool as most of the trails are south and west facing. Terrain varies but 10 miles is predominantly up or downhill. Nice tables at the halfway point. Used to be able to find shards of the lenses from the observatory or pieces of dinnerware and china from the hotel. Views are amazing. I have not hiked this since the Station Fire which pretty much decimated everything but will hike it again this winter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCCowgirlLosAngeles
50,A fun hike..,It is a winding hike on the one side of the mountain until you get to the top...after reaching the top it gets more scenic..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inoque1
40,hike in spring for the wildflowers,We favor hiking in spring to enjoy wildflowers in full bloom. Check out my photographic evidence.We start out as soon as the sun rise to avoid crowds and mountain bikers. This is a very popular trail because of easy access. We prefer to take the Chaney trail loop since it has more shade and fewer hikers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Good experience,Nice workout If you run up then down...Awesome scenery takes only 45 minutes to reach the top!Several trails to reach the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Awesomeness69
50,Great views and deep canyons,"Pass to the right of the Cobb Estate stone gateway at the north end of Lake Avenue. Walk east along the paved driveway paralleling the chain link fence. The driveway curves left but continue to follow the fence to the marked beginning of the Sam Merrill Trail, about 0.1 mile from the gate.Arrive early because parking is hard (on the side of the street on Lake Ave.). There are many optional trails: Sam Merrill, Castle Canyon, Inspiration Point. It is about 10 miles RT. Bring lots of water, there is not much shade... No bathrooms.You don't need the Forest Adventure Pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orcaandbeluga
40,"Rigorous hike, but good! :)","I'd say this is very rigorous, strenuous, but good hike for me. We started kinda late around 1030, so the sun is way up. It wasn't really a hard hike, but it was just too hot (90+ degrees). I'm glad I brought 64oz water and another 64oz of gatorade. If you can bring more than that, you'd be happier.As far as the location, I can't really say that it's a nice or rewarding hike at the end because like it says, it's the ruin do basically whatever's left of it. There are some picnic tables you can relax, enough shades of trees, but there's no bathroom for girls, so if you have to take a leak you will have to find a thick bush unlike for us guys we have no shame.It would be nice if there was a waterfalls at the end, but all you will see is downtown la.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RexrayPhotography
50,First time hiking for 10 miles!,"I've never hiked anything more than 3 or 4 miles but I was up for the challenge.Started the hike at 7:30 with temp around 65 degrees. The hike to Echo mountain's old hotel grounds from the entrance gate is 2.7 miles. If you want to go to inspiration point, it's another 2 miles. Having to hike uphill throughout the whole trip was my biggest challenge. Being plenty of water! I highly recommend hiking to Inspiration point. The view is amazing and I felt SO accomplished! I would definitely recommend this hike to anyone who wants to get away from the city chaos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuhbannteeng
50,A taste of Los Angeles history with great views,"Few people who visit let alone who live in Los Angeles know how many utterly wild trails crisscross this autopolis. There are many places to go to escape urban chaos and this is a trail both therapeutic and rewarding.This is not for the faint of heart -- there's a long uphill climb without shade and if you are doing the full circuit you will need six hours (however, you can also go about half-way and back in three hours and still get wonderful views).Mount Lowe was the destination for one of Henry Huntington's most famous railways. Huntington, in case you don't know, was very much the spirit behind the form of today's Los Angeles. He laid down the lines for his famous ""Red Cars"" to make suburbia accessible and promote real estate development, and it was the railway lines, not highways, that established LA's dispersed format. The Mt. Lowe Railway was built as a premier leisure line, and going up the mountain for the views and fresh air was a great excursion well before the likes of Universal existed.Today you can relive the historical rail journey on foot and there are many informative placards posted along the way. Old machinery lies mournfully next to the great viewpoint half way up: looking out over the immense field of sunlit urban sprawl, you can imagine the midwesterners transplanted to LA seeking delight in their low-density plot of land connected to work, shops and leisure by the umbilical of rail.A great destination for educational field trips (I took my students up there when I taught at UCLA), this is a great place to take in the history and reality of this great if crazed world city.Just remember to take water -- lots of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patisson
50,Great trail right in my backyard,"I love this trail. It goes through chapparel as you do the first 3 miles to echo mountain, then begins to turn into forest as you follow the old train route to mount Lowe and the ruins to the old alpine tavern. Keep going to the ramada for excellent views, alll the way to Catalina island on a clear day. There is about 3000 feet of elevation gain so plan accordingly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Altaresident
50,Mt Lowe Railway Trail,"Starts from Lake Dr in Altadena at the base of the foothills. The climb is reasonable hard going if your not used to going uphill all the way, and extra hard if its a hot day. There is no shade.The old Hotel sight (it was burned in a scrub fire) and abandoned machinery is very interesting, and the view from up there is amazing looking across LA city, all the way to the Pacific Ocean.It is a very popular trail and can get very busy with bikers and hikers, so we had to move over quite frequently to let people past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbunny63
30,well love sounds that are up there,well i liked the sounds up there and i will love to go up ther one day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaR668
