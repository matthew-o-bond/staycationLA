50,Excellent place to see. Must visit.,"I visited this place on a Saturday and there was no one at the museum due early morning hours. There is one number displayed at the entrance. I was about to call and before I could call, a gentleman came there who opened the door even when it was still an hour for its door to open as per their rules. He was very kind and assisted me very well. Music, light effects and beauty of the sculpture is awesome. I was impressed. It was just $10 entry fee and in my opinion it is too less to maintain such wonderful facility. Once you get in , be quiet and stand near lights near to floor and close the doors properly. Also listen to each sentence carefully. You will find yourself enlightened once you come out in 45 minutes. Must visit place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinayakshukre

The director of the museum was gracious and kind, answering all of our questions. The temple itself was beautiful. So make time to go in there, and also make time to have lunch at the $8 buffet. They had enough vegan options for me; the potato salad is definitely worth going back for in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonnish4

50,Extremely interesting... and a lot of fun!,"My niece worked in Culver City and came across the Bhagavad-gita Museum. She immediately thought of me, since I've always been interested in Eastern philosophy. When I came to visit for the holidays, she took me to the museum as a holiday gift. What a great time!I had a cursory familiarity with Hindu philosophy, and the museum provided a lot of detail that I was not familiar with. I found the information about A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, and George Harrison's interest in his philosophy, particularly interesting.There's a lot to absorb, and I was so busy taking pictures of the incredibly detailed dioramas, that I wasn't able to fully concentrate during my first trip through the museum, so I'm planning another visit soon.I also added it to my list in Atlas Obscura (which has a great list of interesting locations around the world).This is definitely one of the most interesting museums I've ever been in - highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdR1126
50,Little Gem,"It was our first trip to Bhagavad Gita museum. The museum is small but different than traditional museums. The multimedia show is impressive and provides a good perspective about Bhagwad Geeta. We really enjoyed our visit to the temple. The museum is rather small and can only accommodate 5-6 people, therefore it is important to book the trip. Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience. Definitely a must for someone who is keen to understand Hinduism.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander702278
50,Visited and never left...,"Not long ago I was a former division I athlete turned professional filmmaker, born of a wealthy family with a beautiful girlfriend (and prospective future wife) whose family was worth billions. I had it ‚Äúall‚Äù in the material sense. The American Dream... but it wasn‚Äôt enough. Because it never is. In October 2018 I consumed an entire mason jar amount of psilocybin mushrooms and was catapulted into a two-month long roller coaster ride where I experienced miracles by the grace God and the hells courtesy of the feverish material energy that I now know to be ‚ÄúYogamƒÅyƒÅ‚Äù. For two months I was lost without a paddle, being thrashed against the jagged rocks of the entropy rapids. I thought it would never end. Then one day while visiting the Griffith Observatory, I was pulled toward a sign reading ‚ÄúFree Meditation Books‚Äù. Up until that point I had been buying three books a day on Amazon, searching for the answers to my spiritual logjam, praying that the turmult might come to an end. My saving grace came on that day on the high mountain above LA in the form of the Bagavad Gita. The nice man behind the book stand handed it to me and invited me to a free Sunday feast at the New Dwarka temple where the Bagavad Gita Museum is located. Having come from a background in aesthetics, I can honestly say I have never seen such a wonder that is the Gita Museum (and hiding in such inconspicuous of places to boot!) I have already seen the dioramas four times in three weeks and each time I receive some new spiritual realization for myself in addition to it flooring the person who Is with me experiencing it for the first time. Whether you are a fellow traveler on your own spiritual parh, an admirer of transcendental storytelling, or just someone looking to fill your time while traveling through LA, your journey will best served with a trip to the Bagavad Gita Dioramma Museum. Hare Krsna!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7727XQbenjaminp
50,Inspirational place,"This is a good place for someone who is not yet initiated the world of Bhagavadgita. The multi media show is quite impressive and grand. The place is small and only limited people ( may be 5-6) can actually stand in the corridor in front of the multimedia presentation. So you need to book your slots during the ticket purchase online and stick to it. This explains the basics of soul and its difference from the physical body. It explains the gist of Hindu philosophy which seeks freedom from the continuous life and death. It explains how you can get liberated from this vicious cycle. It also conveys how every creature on this planet is here because of its past deeds and how the progression towards higher forms of life and eventually to human life( highest form of life) is achieved. The temple adjoining the museum is a nice place to visit and experience it. The vegan restaurant adjoining the museum ( Get a n option to book a buffet with a $5 discount when you book tickets) is a fantastic place. This offers excellent and tasty Indian Vegan buffet with good options with a dessert as well. This place is a hit among the local residents , as they kept trickling in hordes for the buffet or the takeaways. Go ahead and get yourself this experience of a different philosophy of life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srivathsa_kn

40,"Very well done exhibit, teaches religion","This odd little museum is next door to the Hare Krishna temple in Culver City. You pay your fee, and the staff escorts you into the first dark room and begins the automated exhibit. Each diorama has lights and narration, teaching principles of Hinduism and the story of the Bhagavad-Gita. You will learn how Hindus view incarnated life and the purpose of the soul, along with the story of Arjuna and Krishna. As each diorama's presentation ends, you move to the next. This involves some opening and closing of doors in dark spaces. If you have poor night vision, you may wish to have a small light handy to help you move through the exhibit.My investigations of Hinduism ended long ago, and i have for many years been happy following another faith. I went with family members who are non-practicing Christians. Aunt and I were quite impressed with it, Uncle was not too keen on the religious messages. Be clear before you go that the purpose of the museum is religious teaching. It is not merely an Indian cultural display. That said, there is absolutely no pressure from staff to take any additional information or spend any more time if you are ready to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaSPDX

40,Bhagavat Gita essence presented as a treat to the senses,I was initially sceptical about visiting this museum as I did not want to be bored with an endless spiritual monologue or read a bunch of plaques. I was treated to a pleasant surprise. The museum had exhibits which were finely crafted and decorated with elaborate colours and beautiful background props. The lighting was perfect and complimented nicely with the playback audio.The message of the Bhagavad Gita was presented concisely retaining the essence in a way that my 7-year-old daughter could also appreciate both the sacred scripture and also the skill of the artists who put it all together. I would highly recommend it to everyone and especially to kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirti2019

One doesn't have to be a Hindu or a yoga practitioner to appreciate the museum; you will enjoy this if you have a curious nature. Our guide, Radha-Krishna, knowing that I am interested in yogic thought and history, stopped by between each presentation/installation to explain what we had seen in greater detail and to answer any questions. He was very kind and informative. As for the installations themselves, they are beautifully detailed animatronic scenes, accompanied with narration that even a child can understand. Visitors will learn the story of the Bhagavad-Gita and leave with much to consider, if they choose. We finished our visit at Govinda's next door - delicious Indian buffet at $8 a person - a lovely way to digest what we had just seen and heard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seekerlindz

There is need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace, friendship and prosperity with a common cause.

50,Awesome experience!,"I truly was fascinated by this animatronics museum. It is truly amazing and I highly recommend it. For only $10, it is a spectacular and inexpensive attraction. Then grab some wonderful food at the Govinda's cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsX9194RA
50,Speechless Euphoria,"The minute the narration starts and the lights get turned on, you get captivated by the realistic figures wich resemble as if one is actually is part of what is happening. Such spiritual, unique experience cannot be found anywhere but in New Dwarka's Bhagavad Gita museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amararodz
50,"Exciting, fun and informative !!!!","Come to this museum to learn about the Hindu Bhagavad-Gita writings about the benefits of yoga. Dioramas are beautiful and elaborate accompanied by highly dramatic narration. Check out the gift shop and yummy looking cafe next door. Truly a wonderful, culturally enriching experience right in West LA !!! Not to be missed !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanW717
50,One of a kind experience,"The 'museum' is a journey into a series of immersive multimedia chambers both beautiful and repulsive, highlighting aspects of the epic story of the Bhagavad Gita and the 8 limbs of yoga. I cannot recommend this museum enough, you will likely never experience anything quite like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfoley510
50,Amazing spiritual wisdom museum,"We had a great morning at the Bhagavad Gita museum. The exhibits showed how the spirt and the material are separate and how the ancient Indian vedic texts describe the human journey.Highly recommend, it takes about an hour and there is a fantastic vegetarian restaurant on site which opens at 11am. üòä",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255pareshp
50,An Enlightening journey,"The museum is tucked down a corridor between the Krishna Consciousness Temple and Govinda's Restaurant. I've lived in Culver City for 2 years, and I never noticed it. On the outside it seems small, but the dioramas and accompanying audio make for an extravagant cinematic experience. The displays are large and detailed, each with its own light show to compliment the narration and music. It takes only 45 minutes to get through the whole museum, and I guarantee no matter your religious beliefs you will leave feeling enlightened and educated. It was well worth the $10 entry fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tannerr446
50,Insightful exhibit and great temple/ restaurant,"The dioramas were only one of few great activities in this Hare Krishna campus/ temple. There was also their beautiful temple, exotic gift shop and restaurant. So made for a good few hours for the spiritual seeker.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mckleinj
