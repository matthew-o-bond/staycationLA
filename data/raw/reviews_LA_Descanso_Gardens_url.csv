50,Beautiful Place,"If you have a chance to visit Descanso Gardens, you will not be disappointed. It is so beautiful and relaxing. GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millerontap
50,Gorgeous Garden with beautiful tulips and roses,"This is our favorite destination to enjoy beautiful tulips in California. But today for us, it is one of the best open gardens for taking a pleasure walk during Coronavirus outbreak. With everything closed and to following the guidelines from CDC, it is refreshing to immerse yourself in the beauty of the flowers an nature without bumping into crowd of people. The tranquility of the garden just helped us calm our nerves during this time of crisis. It also helped that we were able to get in for free as the garden gives free admission on every third Tuesday of the month. We just down loaded the ticket and showed them to the park attendant to get in.With over 150 acres of land, according to their website, the Descanso Gardens features nine botanical collections, a (ride-able) miniature railroad, house museum, modern art gallery, cafe and gift shop. The urban retreat also boasts a redwood forest, streams, a lake, a bird sanctuary and the largest camellia garden in the United States.Today, we decided to get out of the house and visit the Descanso Garden. My wife got the ticket on their website. Though we were only able to visit three gardens as we have to get back home.The tulip garden is such a beauty. With the different colors of tulips, the ground has transformed into a colorful floral carpet. I understand that they got their tulips from Holland with many different varieties. Besides tulips, there are other flower species in this garden including camellias, irises, lilacs, cherry trees, clivia and daffodils.We also visited the Japanese garden. Unfortunately, we missed the cherry blossom. Otherwise, it would be one of the best naturally decorated gardens in LA. Japanese Garden includes many plants that originated in Asia, including camellias, black pines, mondo grass, flowering cherry trees and Japanese maples. The peace of the garden is punctuated by the sounds of birds, water burbling in the stream and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. Many times when I took pictures here, I fooled my friends into believing that I am in Japan.Finally, we visited the rose garden and took many pictures here. According to the record, the former owner of this property bought many roses from his Japanese friend during World War II and planted them here.Thanks to this awesome garden and its natural beauty, we feel much better now with less anxiety. Will come more often to this garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34regisk
50,"Gorgeous oasis in Montrose, California area!","Gorgeous oasis of ancient forests, camellias, roses, Japanese gardens, and more to wander slowly through. Lovely house atop the hill trail with interesting sculpture, bonsai arrangements and interactive drawing opportunities for kids of all ages. Delightful show in Art Gallery highlighting the ""apple"" and its mutations by human cultivation. Special enclave!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drkarensiegel
50,Enchanted Forest on New Year’s Eve,All 3 generations on our girl trip loved the Enchanted Forest lights! We were totally amazed! I grew up nearby and completed enjoyed being at Descanso Gardens again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allergygrammyz
50,So serene and peaceful,"We went in early February and most of the flowers weren't out yet, but it was still a peaceful and lovely visit through the oak forests, the Japanese Garden, the ancient forest, and the California garden. The ripple of a little stream, the towering oak and redwoods overhead, and a few blooming camellias and azaleas added to the serenity. I just felt relaxation wash over me. That said, I'd like to come back in a couple of months to see the camellias, azaleas, roses and lilacs in full bloom. I bet it's spectacular",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLSBrown
30,Special if you're an Angelino; Pretty Underwhelming if you're not,"While it is nice to have some dedicated green space in a city of concrete freeways like Los Angeles, Descanso Gardens probably won't impress any out-of-towners. It's a pretty small space; big by city standards, but it's no Central Park or anything even remotely near that. You can stroll around with babies and entertain your kids on a silly little park train, but most people visiting on the weekends are there for first dates and trying to show how outdoorsy they can be. You'll notice them because they're conspicuously overdressed. There are better choices in LA (the Arboretum and Griffith Park, to name just two) and certainly loads of better choices in other cities (just about anywhere in Northern California, for example) around the country. I've been to Descanso Gardens half a dozen times now and still cannot figure out why it is held in such high regard by locals, even though it's within ten miles of my own home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfessorHedonism
40,A beautiful place for a leisurely stroll among natural woodlands and some structured gardens,"Our January visit to Descanso Gardens was less-than-spectacular, merely because this is not the time of year for flowering plants and roses. Even the garden's famous camelia forest was showing only a few early pastel flowers, though lots of near-ready buds held the promise of better viewing to come ""soon."" At this time of year, the old-wood forests are really the highlight, with enormous trees dominating the scene and shielding the rich green ground covers from the sun. In winter, the beautiful Japanese garden and tea house seemed ""out-of-season,"" and the carefully designed rose garden was bereft of flowers. A few mallards swam and foraged in the garden's tiny ""lake"" (really just a shallow pond).Still, the tranquility of the place is magical, and definitely encourages introspection and contempation at any of the many resting spots and viewpoints scattered along the myriad paved and mulched trails. One of the nice things about Descanso is that visitors are actually encouraged to leave the trails and wander in the woods, offering a kind of spontaneity often missing from other formal gardens. We saw lots of young couples strolling, and moms with small children, all enjoying the peaceful, natural environment. The kids seemed to be enjoying their outing, despite the lack of blooms.There's a small gift shop, a nice cafeteria and convenient restrooms.Although this is a Los Angeles public park, there's an admission charge (modest by comparison with other area attractions), and there are discounts for children and seniors. Plenty of parking is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Projournalist
40,Christmas lights at Descanso Gardens - lovely!,"Went with daughter and baby grandson, a lovely wander at night through the various themes and views, but would like to go back some day to see it all in daylight just as a beautiful garden. The lights of course spectacular at Christmas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyP214
50,Lovely even on a SoCal winter day,"The Descano Gardens are a treat to visit, even in what is probably their least showy time of year. With a big rose garden (and a few hardy roses still in bloom), camellia garden, California plant garden, Japanese tea house, play areas for kids, manor house and art exhibits, there are areas to appeal to everyone. They have a an outdoor lighting exhibit over the holidays, which was lost on us during the day, though we were still interested by the big laser cut luminaries, and a garden of color changing flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollym952
50,Amazing Light Gardens,We have visited several time when the various gardens were in full glory but this was the first visit to the night gardens which were absolutely amazing.

40,Enchanted Forest of Light,"The Garden: Wow!! What a transformation into colorful garden at night!!I found complimentary tickets on Goldstar website. All I needed to pay was service fee of $7.5. What a steal~ Just print out the tickets on Goldstar and they can just scan the barcode at the gate.There are ten sections and all very well directed.

10,CARVED - What a huge disappointment!,"Went to CARVED today with my family and in-laws from Germany. What a huge disappointment. We went to Enchanted Forest last year and it was beautiful but this event is a scam, not worth it. I want my money back! No parking space, it took us literally 30min to find a spot. I was sent twice back to Main Street. Unbelievable long waiting line to get inside, another waiting line inside just to see their carved pumpkins. Total wait time about 2h to see pumpkins for 10 min paid full price for 3y old but no kids activities at all, (there was a hay house you can get for free on every pumpkin patch around the corner) 200$ for nothing, what a joke!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riekel2019
50,Garden visit,"I have been a longtime member and try to visit often as the seasons and displays change. It is also a great place to get away from the ""world"".The best time to visit is during the week days when there are fewer guests.I always find a plant or gift at the shop. Also a walk up to the house is always worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/santajosef
30,Don't visit ih September,Most summer plants and flowers had already bloomed. Not many roses blooming either. Dry season. The Japanese Garden was nice and green. The employees were friendly. Nice gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/656susand
40,Descanso Gardens,Descanso Gardens is a lovely and peaceful place to visit. My young children used to enjoy visiting and feeding the ducks many years ago. It is a delightful place to walk around and contemplate natural beauty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/612bobs

40,Beautiful and peaceful experience,"Descanso Gardens is a welcome oasis less than a half-hour from downtown Los Angeles. The gardens are beautiful and the rolling terrain makes for an intimate feel that, again, totally belies the fact that you're so close to one of the largest cities in the country! Navigating the gardens was a little tough, I wasn't quite sure where I was most of the time, but I sure enjoyed it. I can't imagine how many weddings must be held here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eightwednesday
50,A Completely Beautiful Experience,"This place is huge, diversified and reasonably priced with a good discount for seniors. The many different sections are listed on the brochure so you can pick and choose of follow the map to visit them all. Allow at least two hours for your visit because you are going to want to relax at some of the gardens of water scenes. Bring your best camera and comfortable shoes for there are many locals to visit. There are both paved and unpaved paths that lead to each area. We saved the forests for our next visit on their free third Tuesday of the month. We enjoy visiting the lake and each of the gardens, especially the Japanese garden, the Rose garden, and the Lilac garden. My only criticism is they could improve on their signage for those who find certain maps challenging. Other than that, I would say not to worry about going on a hot day for there are numerous shaded places and comfortable places to sit and enjoy the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,A wonderful place to visit for the whole family,"I have been coming to Descanso Gardens for forty years. The Oak Forest and the Camelia Forest (what I call it because the camelias are over seven feet tall) and the lilacs and the roses and the native plants gardens and....well, I think you get the idea. A strole through the gardens is great exercise and relaxing for the soul.Children love Descanso. There are so many places to explore. In the summer there are concerts on the green where families bring picnics with wine or beer but no one ever has too much to drink. The children are well behaved but aren't forced into an assigned seat. Some people bring blankets and others bring lawn chairs. If you don't have time to fix food there is usually a vendor who has food and beverage on a limited scale.The Maple restaurant serves outstanding meals for brunch and lunch. I have found that dinners there are a bit noisy inside and I haven't had a lot of luck at dinner with the outside dining which is lovely but chilly for my taste. They do often offer an afghan if they sense someone is cold. But on warm nights it is a hard spot to beat.There isn't enough room to explain the many various areas at Descanso. It can take years to come to know this multi-acre property and all of the beauty it has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy4413
40,Lovely Gardens,"This is a nice day trip in the LA area. It always has a lot of lovely plants, trees and flowers to see and the scenery is really pretty.

50,"Roses, Roses, Roses","The most beautiful rose garden I have been too (even Huntington, gasp).

I visited early April, a little late for the Tulips, A little early for the Cherry Blossoms, but it was still a lovely visit and enjoy all the trees, plants in all the gardens. The farther you got away from the main center and up to the hills, the more peaceful it was. The paths seem to take you every where and can easily get disoriented when your tired and thirsty. I wish there were ""you are here"" maps located through out. I never knew where I was. Not sure if it was just for Tomato-mania, but like everything else in LA, get there early.

They were speaking rudely to customers, and I witnessed them telling an elderly couple that they couldn’t park in an available handicap space, for which they had a placard. Then I witnessed one of the parking lot attendants become confrontational with another family as they were walking next to us. What is going on here? The parking lot staff looks like they’re composed of gang members and thugs. It was very unpleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMUni

50,A great find,"I wasn't aware of this lovely place until a recent trip. Full of blooming tulips and flowering cherry trees and camellias. It's large, but still a manageable size to walk around in a single afternoon or morning. It offers not just a huge variety of flora, but also lovely views of surrounding mountains. There is a Japanese garden area, an ""ancient"" forest with redwood trees, lots of roses, and a large pavilion for events surrounded by flower gardens. It even has a little train for a ride around the grounds suitable for children..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimBocaRaton_Florida

Descanso has an extensive oak forest canopy under which lies the largest camellia forest in the New World. In fact, a good time to visit is when the gardens have one of their frequent camellia shows. There are also a world class rose garden, a cactus garden, a lilac garden, and a Japanese garden. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimP988

50,"Wow, wow, wow!","Went to the seasonal Enchanted: Forest of Light display. Frankly, I’ve only ever been mildly amused at such seasonal “lighted” attractions, so had fairly low expectations. Delightedly, this blew me away. Truly felt transported to another dimension of reality, where magical lighting emanating within and around the gardens is the norm. Astonishingly beautiful and continually surprising. Truly did not want the evening to end and it was quite cold and windy at the time, so that is saying a lot as to how wonderful the experience was. Further, the staff and volunteers were cheerful and welcoming and the refreshment stops along the walk appealed to both young and old. To the organizers, all I can say is, “Well done”. I’ve attached a few photos but as beautiful as they are, they don’t do it justice. Take friends, family, anyone you can grab and go and be astounded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwX2677ZI

Better to go after the rain storms due this week. We walked around anyway and was surprised to find a deer roaming about and took some snapshots that turned out quite nice. Weekdays has the advantage of small number of people, mainly mothers with their kids. Only disadvantage was the train was not running, part of track was being repaired.

Dinner at Maples was also well with the cost of the reservation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingz00
50,Forest of Lights,"The lights were beautiful that we were able to see. The last sections of the garden had a power outage so we couldn’t see them. The staff was helpful and offered return tickets for those who could reschedule and worked with others who couldn’t. It is certainly something that I would recommend to folks to come to at least once. The artistry of the lights in various forms was beautiful. This is not your typical Christmas light display. It is artistic and interactive. I’ve never experienced something like it before.Recommended most for: I think it would be the best outing for families or grandparents with young children. There are various places were you can step on lights and have them change colors. There are quite a few interactive areas for kids with young children. That said, we enjoyed what we were able to see very much and hope to go back another time and see the rest of the gardens when our schedules allow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thankful-Travelers4
50,A beautiful and peaceful place,This is one of my son's favorite places on Earth. It has a very meditative and recharging feel to it. I got him a membership that he keeps renewing. This time we went to the Enchanted garden light show at night that was most amazing. Beautiful lighting and wonderful music. This place is very well run and kept up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenberetateam
20,Enchanted Forest of Lights,This was supposed to be a magical night out with a large group for a Christmas party. The lights were ok. What was really disappointing was there was no Christmas music but what sounded like spa music. We walked through it in 30 minutes as there just wasn’t a lot to see. An overpriced event at $60 per couple.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyc314
40,Enchanted Forrest,"The night time exhibition and light show is terrific. It is a great outing for families, especially with young kids. The lights, tress are really well done because of the natural beauty of the exhibits. Great for young and old",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jclayind
50,Forest Of Lights Tour,"Advance purchase of your tickets is required for entry into the gardens. On your ticket, you will be given an entrance time to arrive, plan ahead because there will be long lines.Things to bring: light stick and or glow sticks.Wear comfortable clothes, and layers because it's colder because the garden is located in the mountains.Camera: If you're interested in taking pictures or video, make sure that your camera takes pictures at night without light. There are no lamp posts or pathway lights on the garden tour.Forest Of Lights: The enchanted forest was magical and I like how they blended music into each display. My favorite would have to be the magical orbs and red lantern light display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KoreanConven
30,"Enchanted Forest only, not a holiday show, underwhelming","This review is only for the Enchanted Forest of Lights; which is a special evening attraction at the gardens that currently only happens during the winter holiday season from late November to early January. I attended this show with high hopes in search of some holiday spirit. It is a collection of 10 light displays, the 1st one being incredible: some synchronized color changing flower lights with music...very nice, unfortunately that was the highlight of the 10 displays and it all went downhill from there. If you are looking for something to get you into the x-mas spirit this is not it, it really is just as the name suggests; just a fairyland feel. There were really only 3 really nice displays of the 10. The flowers at the entrance, some firefly looking lasers at the trees and the Chinese lanterns at the end...everything else is just plain underwhelming and not worth the regular price of $28 per person, which thankfully I did not pay, as it is way too much for what they offer some colorful lights shooting up at trees, and some LED strings and pedestals. There are other holiday offering in southern California that are way more impressive. I attended with 5 other people ranging from 12-60 years of age and overall the response was the same...ok but not having the Wow factor you would expect. This attraction has so much potential but it is still not hitting the mark. However if you want to check it our for yourself, I will have to add that my 15 year old really loved the beignets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAExplorer69
50,Garden Light Installation,The mile long walk with lights illuminating the path and nestled into the foliage and trees was spectacular. It is perfect for children and adults. The wiskey bar was a plus for two adult couples especially since it was cold and raining but it did not detract from our enjoyment and made the walk more surreal. Bring an umbrella if it rains. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cafegirlreva12
50,Enchanted Forest Was The Best Party I've been to ALL year!,I went to the opening night preview party and was thrilled to pieces with the night. Music everywhere. All different types. Only one missing was jazz. But the rest of the night? Sublime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Already on my bucket list for next year. Going to take my friends. Dress warm! It gets cold up there! SUPER fun night with the music and all the different acts along the paths. Food was excellent. Drinks perfect. The light show and dance floor were bigger and better than last year! A little pricey but worth every single penny! DO IT!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg
40,Peaceful Place,"Very nice, eclectic gardens right in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Relaxing and contemplative if you take it at a slow pace. Had an excellent, autistic guide. I would recommend going sometime other than on a hot, summer day to more fully enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vatonorteno
50,Love The Lights,"We went with our young adult daughter shortly after it opened. We’ve been there at different times of the year, but they went all out with their Enchanted Forest of Lights. It’s artistic genius! The special effects were nothing short of amazing. It’s a must see over the holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madartist54
40,A day well spent,"Surprised my wife with a day trip to Descanso Gardens. She loves flowers and plants so I figured she would like a visit here. I was right cause she fully enjoyed our time here. They are open year round. Depending on the time of the year, different plants will be blooming. There are several gardens to browse and admire at the property. We spent most of our time at the beautiful Rose Garden and peaceful Japanese Garden.Boddy House and Sturt Haaga Gallery are two other places that should not be missed at Descanso Gardens. They are both free with admission to Descanso Gardens. If you get hungry, then they have a cafe to satiate your hunger. Did not try them though.Great place to spend the day. Affordable and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpoNationals
40,Descanso Gardens - Enchanted: Forrest of Light,"Every year this attraction puts on a light show throughout the property for visitors to enjoy. The displays of colorful lights have many different themes some of which you can walk through and interact with. Most of the areas are accessible and walking shoes are recommended. There are some food options but it can be a bit pricey. You can easily spend 2-3 hours there and this event is only at night. A great date night for couples and also fun for the family. The parking can be challenging due to it's popularity, I recommend arriving early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roblg2018
40,Beautiful Park,"As we were staying close by and still getting over our jet lag, we visited Descanso Gardens for a quiet day at the start of our California trip. The park was beautiful, even in October as the gardens weren't at their prime. We spent a couple of hours here but you could easily spend longer if you take a picnic etc. We did a walk around most of the park and managed to see three wild deer on our walk.Included in the ticket is Boddy House and Sturt Haaga Gallery which are well worth popping into.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcglassa
50,Paradise,"To critics - this is a SEASONAL botanical garden, so expect plants and flowers based on season in which you come to visit. I love this place at all times of the year, but spring is by far my most favorite. The abundance of lilacs (one of the very few places in SoCal where you can see them grow), tulips and daffodils combined with gorgeous weather makes this a true paradise and a sanctuary, a perfect escape from city noise. Enjoy a cup of tea in Japanese Tea House ad you look over the cherry blossoms surrounding the stream. Watch Koy swim in a colorful display among ducks. So much more to see..!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678mvi
50,Always a Pleasure,"Even though I live nearby, it is always fun coming to this garden because I can get my exercise, bird watching, and escape from the day to day stress relief in 1 shot.Come here in the weekday. It is not busy and you can hike as much as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenskef
50,Beautiful Gardens,"I came back after ten years, and I am so happy the place is still the same and as beautiful and well kept as always.The rose garden is wonderful with a craftsman style pavilion.There is also a Japanese garden with a tea house and a small brook.On our walk we saw three deer which seem to be used to encounter humans because they were not afraid of us.I highly recommend the trip, it’s worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstefBB
30,Toy Train Only Attraction,Hardly any flowers even in Rose Garden Just walk around and enjoy Japanese Garden Enchanted Rail is only attraction worth the name. Steep Entry Fee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorabh
40,Beautiful flowers and views!,"The walk to the house in the garden was a little hard because of the steep incline of the hill, but aside from that it was a nice work out and fun to do. House was beautiful and staff in there were very friendly. I did get hit in the head a few times from the squirrels drooping nuts, but i thought that was pretty funny. Though there weren't a lot of blooming flowers around it was still nice and peaceful garden to visit. Would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195esthery
50,Spring,These gardens are absolutely amazing in the Spring. The azaleas a d camelias are without equals in Southern California. I've been less impressed at other times of the year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Worth the trip from anywhere,"It was worth the trip from Anaheim…I planned this visit from the cold snowy environs where I had broken my ankle in January; while recovering, I saw a show about this garden on KCET's website and I wasn’t going to let anything stop me, even if I had to abbreviate the visiting all areas because I couldn’t walk well. I was able to visit on a “free” day which was wonderful. There is free parking, so that was a bonus. The gift shop and the café were on the way into the gardens, so I knew where those would be when I wanted to eat and shop. The day was very warm, but the pathways through the part of the gardens I visited were navigable and when there was a bench in the shade, I sat down and enjoyed the beauty of all things natural. Earlier, I sat at a table with other people who were making light catchers using wide pieces of clear contact paper and beautiful colored rose petals for decoration. The basket of rose petals was just beautiful and that in itself would be an aromatic decoration for a party, a birthday, or someone in a sick bed. Another memorable spot was in a small grove of oak trees. It was lovely. On my walk around, I even saw two women who work at the garden that were featured in the public television show. I pressed on to see the rose garden…every color and type imaginable. Great photo opportunities there. I was tiring and wandered back to eat. I bought a sandwich but after I saw a salad that someone else had gotten, I knew I made the wrong choice! It was too hot to eat so heavy. Lol! I then went to the gift shop and bought a discounted book of postcards and a pair of earrings in the shape of flowers. I also bought a beautiful succulent plant for the friend with whom I stayed. Next time I hope to visit more of the gardens and commune with the old growth oaks that go back to the days when the property was a rancho. Since I was there early, I left early, around 2 p.m. The drive back to OC was quicker than I thought and I was able to take a nap before my friend got home from work…saying this because if you think Descanso Gardens is too far to make the trip, if you plan it right, it is definitely worth the visit and I want to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
50,"Time out in nature, family friendly lunch, a house with history","We spent most of a day there, wandering through the trails, enjoying the views and the feeling of being out in nature rather than in a large city. Thanks to the staff, who gave me some plain paper, I was even able to sketch the views. We had a pleasant lunch at an outside table at the cafe, where people of all ages fitted in. The house, from the 1930s and built by the successful publisher E. M. Boddy, who turned the former Rancho Descanso into a lovely botanical garden was interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gunterdiana
50,Spent A Self Date Here Today,"What a wonder this place is. I barely got half way through because I was so mesmerized by so much beauty. I started out and meandered along until a young doe held my gaze and away we went. I followed her and watched her graze.right out in the open amongst throngs of respectful children and a train touring right behind her. If I didnt know better I would have thought I was at Disneyland! When some gregarious children chased her away, I relaxed in the shade alongside a beautiful waterfall in the shade. I stayed for a while, watching the sun dance through the trees, took a meditative nap, and some photos. Before I was ready, it was closing time!!! I cant wait to go back and explore some.more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg
40,Nice Variety,"I was at Descanso Gardens for a wedding. I walked around the grounds and enjoyed the many varieties of plants and flowers. There are numerous hiking paths that zig zag about. The Gardens are not that large, but still interesting. A nice place to spend a lazy hour in a peaceful, beautiful place away from the intensity of the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmcquest
50,Absolutely Beautiful Gardens,"I bought an annual membership and have enjoyed the summer concerts, lovely morning walk - 1 hour before teh public:-) Great place to meet a friend ans walk and chat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julial3054
50,Tranquility in La Canada,"When you visit Descanso Gardens, you can disappear into the ""back country"" and find deer, coyotes, all kinds of wild birds, and waterfowl. Descanso is known for many of it's beautiful garden areas, such as the Japanese Gardens, the Rose Garden and the Ancient Forest to name a few. Too hot to enjoy much past July 4th and continues to get brutally hot into August. October thru June is the best time to visit and if at all possible, check to see if school field trips are scheduled on the day of your visit to avoid loud and excited children in the garden. The kids have a great time - however they scare away all the wildlife and birds while on their field trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442gailm
50,Best gardens in greater LA,"Descanso has always felt like a more intimate, community-based gardens than some of the others in LA and its surrounding areas, like Huntington. They make an effort to put on great events, the restaurant is a nice addition, and the work they do to improve the grounds while also still keeping everything native is remarkable.I can't recommend a membership enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
50,"You Come, You See, You Are Smitten","Descanso Gardens is a bit like the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden: well-graded pathways winding through carefully labeled and tended planted areas, and a totally peaceful expeience . Here, the oak forests provide canopies of shade, and the plentiful benches are an open invitation to take a few minutes' rest and contemplate your surroundings, including the nearby mountains. You are sharing this habitat with several varieties of animals, including birds (lots of owls), fish, reptiles, and mammals, including bobcats; although most aren't up and about during the day. The guided walking tour is well worth your time. Wear comfortable clothes, especially shoes; you'll be doing a lot of walking. Parking is free, admission is reasonable, food and conveniences are available, and the experience is priceless. Much more information on their web site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnMacMurray
10,Extremely disappointing,Visited the gardens today and found them extremely disapponting. They looked neglected and uncared for. I know water is a problem but plants were wilting and needed much dead heading. The Japanese garden had little water in it and most of the ponds and streams had run dry. The little train around the gardens was also not operating. A complete waste of $9. The gardens of the houses opposie were in better condition and more colourful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iangS7048QV
50,A smaller version of the Huntington Gardens,"Located near the wonderful Huntington Gardens, Descanso is a more affordable option and is wonderful in its own right. Gorgeous greenery and gardens, long paths and a decent place to grab a bite make this place enjoyable when you don't feel like dishing out $30 for the Huntington. At only $7 its a good deal and offers free parking, come early and you will have most of the park to yourself. I love this place. Theres lots of benches within the park and you can lounge for hours and read a book.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
30,Pleasant place to spend an afternoon,"A nice setting with a rose garden, ponds and streams. Occasionally, some wildlife, and usually squirrels, birds, turtles, etc.It is best to go in the spring when the majority of the flowers are in bloom, but there is usually something to see year round. There are tours on the weekends and special events, check the web site, descansogardens.org, for specific schedules. There is a snack bar/cafe with a nice assortment of salads, sandwiches, drinks, etc and picnicking is allowed. There is an admission fee, but the third Tuesday of the month is free.Be sure to bring or buy water, particularly in the summer months as it can get quite warm. There is some changes in elevation, so nice walking shoes are best. There is ample free parking. The best time to visit is during the week as it is not very crowded. There are plenty of benches throughout the gardens, so plan to spend time sitting and enjoying nature. The Boddy House, up on the hill, is usually open and interesting to see. Some original furniture and artwork, also a small nature center in a nearby building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22philipr
40,A walk in the woods.,"We had a great visit and enjoyed our walk through the many gardens and groves. The high lights were the roses, the outdoor wedding sight with floral walkway and gazebo, the Japanese garden and the many ponds. Best of all was the restored home of the previous owner. Great to imagine his life there last century. Wonderful shop with flowers and plants plus cute gifts. An impressive garden and park. Thanks to the foresight of those who donated and preserved this gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929ch
40,Delightful,"My husband and I travel extensively and we always visit botanical gardens as highlights of our trips. The Descanso Gardens feature a rose garden and a Japanese garden. There are also many other flowers as well as a huge amount of Camellia trees. Unfortunately we missed the camellia's in bloom but they would be worth seeing if you time your visit when they bloom as there are 100,000 trees on the grounds.There is a very nice gift shop with reasonable prices and a cafe with reasonable priced sandwiches and salads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwjd1947
50,Beautiful Rose Garden,"Great garden, clean and beautiful. We had lunch at their cafe. Food was great and price reasonable. Nice people. Also they have a store that you can buy cute little gifts. Hundreds camellia trees! I was so lucky to see a beautiful deer there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hello2you_10
40,Marvelous Hidden Gem of a Garden,"This 36,000 acre refuge in Glendale offers some of the best gardens in Southern California. Inexpensive to enter, free parking, it is totally afforable on most budgets. Much is devoted to children and garden lovers as well as concerts and other cultural events on the grounds. Well worth the trip away from Downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247barryr
50,Beautiful blooms in April and May,"Don’t need to worry you will walk too much. It’s not too big garden, but have so many plants and flowers you never see before. So many flowers bloom in April and May now. It only takes about two hours to walk if you don’t stop to take many kinds of flower and trees pictures. They even have tall redwood trees. They also have geese, ducks, turtles, fishes and many kinds of birds. General ticket is $9, senior and student are $6, and $4 children 5-12, free to children 4 and younger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pldjm
40,Great day trip for just $9 per person!,"Would like to go back again! Been a resident of the Greater LA area for more than a decade and finally went the other day. Good place to come for a quick, easy escape and was a very relaxing/soothing experience. We were there for about 3-4 hours on our dayoff after a late big breakfast. The camellias were in full bloom, managed to see somewhat of the cherry blossoms, but not too many roses were in bloom. Don't stop there; keep walking past the Japanese Garden and stroll through the Ancient Forest and take time to walk up to Manchester Boddy's House, (who made this beautiful estate originally and was the publisher of the then ""Los Angeles illustrated Daily News"") and the Gallery. They have restrooms there as well, if you don't want to go all the way back to the entrance/gift shop area.Tip: They have guided tours too. We took one, a great way to get yourself familiarized with the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
50,Beautiful place to walk or even hike,"If you are in the area, I highly recommend a trip to Descanso Gardens. It truly is a hidden gem. Really beautiful gardens with many hidden areas that are great to sit and read or sketch. There are also open areas where the kids can run and you can sit and relax while watching them. You can also do some nice hiking here. This is a great day trip for plant experts to families wanting to get out of the house. There is a really nice picnic area just outside the gardens so you can bring a picnic lunch, if you don't want to purchase from the cafe. Make sure to visit the Boddy house and gallery. I think it's more manageable and family friendly than the near by Huntington Library.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julesartgarden
50,Cherry Blossoms,Oh so beautifu to see. Love the cherry blossoms. They’re everywhere at Descanso Gardens right now. It’s always a relaxing day just to walk around and take pictures of spring bloom. A little trail hike can be added to the scenic walk through the garden. Now is the perfect time before it gets hotter. Always a favorite place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mscanastra
40,What a Gem!,"Large garden in LA created by the Boddy Family now owned by the city. Admission is $9 for adults with senior (over 65), student, and military discounts. Plan to spend 2+ hours here, although you could see the major attractions near the entrance in less time. Most, but not all of the grounds are stroller & wheelchair friendly. Highlights include a Japanese Garden, a redwood and fern forest, a large rose garden, a lake and walking trails through native California trees. 80% of the park can be enjoyed from the paved trails, but there are side trails for the more adventurous.Descanso is known for it's Camellia trees and cherry blossoms so Spring is the ideal time to visit, but any season should be rewarding. There are adequate staff on the grounds to answer questions, there are several spots to sit and relax in the shade and guided tours are available. The Boddy House is open to visit, and includes a history of the family and the gardens. The garage has been converted into an art gallery. These gardens should delight visitors of any age. SoCal has many beautiful public gardens - Descanso is one of my favorites and well worth the $9 admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JWBGrapevine
50,Loved this place!,Really enjoyed our visit. There are so many trails to choose from. You can get a work out or just relax and stroll. Lots of places to sit down and lots of shade! Really enjoyed all the gardens. If I lived in the area I would come here all the time just to relax and get away from it all. Lots of Camellias in bloom when we were there. Very inexpensive admission price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeyDog
50,Always beautiful and changing,"Beauty that’s constantly changing, yet always amazing.You can spend as little as an hour or all day there . Enjoy the pond , the gardens and the gift shop . There is an excellent plant selection for sale at the gift shop.Great place for families to enjoy nature .Descanso has always been good , but I must say recently it’s better than ever .Consider a meal at the Maple restaurant. Reservations are a good idea",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckG624
30,not much to see,"Maybe we visited wrong time of the year? There's a tiny tulip garden, the rose garden is bared, we didn't see a single rose, the creeks are empty. Mostly big trees surround the garden (or more likely park). The Japanese garden is not much to see since it's too small. We're disappointed with all the rave reviews.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveH350
40,"Pleasant, relaxing, inexpensive",Lovely relaxed gardens with rambling paths. Smaller and maybe not as well designed or involved as other gardens but it was very inexpensive. It was still large enough and pretty enough to take up most of the day. Beautiful flowers. The free map they give you is useless. I wish it was more detailed and easier to follow as I'm sure I missed a lot. Due to knee pain I avoided some paths but if I knew where they led I might have made the effort. It is supposed to be spectacular at Christmas with their lights. Worth a visit at various times of the year,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieM795
20,Disappointing garden,"This garden is small and not interesting at all. A couple of tulips, nothing else was blooming (end of March). If you want to see a real garden, go to The Huntington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariebeukenoot
50,Peaceful,We really liked this place. Very calm and peaceful. They have some very nice flowers. You can hang out and relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthogx
30,Sweet but average,"This is an average garden that is good if you live near it or you have not much else to do. Probably better for moms with smaller children. Lots of fun winding paths, little bridges. An interesting tiny train track runs around the property. Tulips were in bloom and were very pretty. Too early for the roses which might have been good to see- there appear to be many of them. Not many labels if any on the plants. The plantings appear to be random rather than well planned. Appears to be underfunded and understaffed. Lilac garden smelled great but only 2 were blooming and it looked like all needed fertilizing. The gift shop is fantastic- lots of plants and darling gift items, books etc. very nice people working throughout the gardens. Lots of Camellias and they were blooming. It has a cafe, senior discounts and reciprocity for other gardens. We went to the Huntington library and gardens after this and they were absolutely spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallasmommy
50,A lovely visit,"We've been to Descanso Gardens several times, and we are always amazed at the beauty of the horticultural exhibitions there. This time, the cherry blossoms were just starting to bloom and the tulips were in full flower. Many of the camillias were blossoming, also. A treat for the eyes! The grounds are beautifully maintained, and the pathways easily navigable. Take a couple of hours and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,Beautiful camellias and amazing house.,We paid the senior rate of $6 each and walked the trails west of the entry. Tulips were blooming and trees were glorious. We we looped around to the camellia area and were astonished by the thousands of various wonderful mature shrubs and trees. The Japanese area was particularly great. We walked up to the Boddy house and were surprised by the open house and wonderful condition of the stately 1939 house. The ancient forest leads to the lilac garden that was just starting to bloom. We had lunch at the cafe and had a superior angus beef burger.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235kennethr
50,Lovely,"Enjoy walking through the property...peaceful and beautiful.Only negative is someone foolishly gave a contact to Maple that does not require them to be open same hours as descanso. Such a disappointing waste of space. Might not renew membership based on this...an ice tea, glass if wine, or light bite pre or post garden walk so important.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JACB5
40,Enchanted Forest!,"This review pertains to the Enchanted Forest, a holiday-themed, evening walk through the gardens that is offered in November, December and part of January. Tickets must be booked in advance with a timed entry. Although people were parking on the street, there was parking the lot, so I recommend trying that first. It can get cold after dark this time of year in SoCal, so dress accordingly. It takes about 90 minutes to walk through the various areas - the trees and other areas are magnificently lit was different colored, changing LEDs and there are a number of other surprises that are fun for kids and adults. Food and drink (including adult beverages) are available, but the lines can be long and it isn't inexpensive. I'm not sure we will go every year, but the entire family was really happy we went this time. One last tip, since there are lots of people moving all around, it was a bit dusty, so casual wear is appropriate and those people in ""dating"" attire didn't seem as comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricG141
50,Interesting Gardens,"We went to see the camillias, but were a little early. It was still a beautiful place to see and visit. After walking through the gardens, we checked out the Sturt Haaga Gallery. Very interesting art. You can take part in the art by using chalk on a mural.The Boddy House is more a museum. The house is beautiful with furniture from the time it was built.It is truly a""place of rest.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spicemom2013
40,Relaxing Peaceful Beautiful,"A low cost, $9 for adults, & $6 for seniors, retreat to nature. Mature trees, beautiful Camilla, many water features and lots of benches to sit and enjoy the scents, sounds and sights. We saw 2 deer in a meadow. The Boddy house and the small museum were a nice bonus to all the nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryrR1666RC
50,Camillia’s in bloom,"In January and February this is the place to be. Camillias extraordinaire. There must be thousands of Camillias. And they are winter blooming flower. So many different shapes and styles and colors, it’s a beautiful way to spend the day wandering hundreds of acres of Camillias. Came upon a couple of deer grazing in the fresh green grass. Hey magical place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotMichael
50,Thanksgiving Brunch & Gardens,If you are in LA over the Thanksgiving holiday I would highly recommend this for an alternative to cooking Thanksgiving dinner. The meal was well prepared and delicious and the setting is beautiful. After you have a lovely meal take a stroll through the gardens. I especially enjoyed their Japanese garden. Next year I would love to get tickets for their Festival of Lights where you tour the gardens at night and they are lighted up in creative ways.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c-shell71
50,Great refuge near almost everything,"Descanso Gardens is a wonderful place for a group to gather and tour. It is very peaceful, has great history and an interesting art gallery. When trees and flowers are in bloom it would be even more spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnsotr
50,Paradise At Your Doorstep,"This is truly a beautiful and relaxing place to be. One does have to walk a bit to get around to see everything -but it's all in a tranquil area - non rushed. At times there's a train for the kids. There's Boddy House - very interesting history, an art gallery, different types of gardens, a lake, a nice shop, restaurant - and they're building a new area which should be ready around Feb 2018. It's only $ 9 to get in and so worth the money. There's a large parking lot so shouldn't be a problem to park either - free.

50,"Go to Arlington Gardens, Pasadena, too- both fabulous and near each other","Descano Gardens is very pretty and on a hot day many of the trails are shaded. We've seen it during rose bloom and camellia bloom when it was amazing. We love to visit gardens and are often in Pasadena where our daughter is at school. We highly recommend Arlington Gardens in Pasadena. It is a 3-acre garden maintained by community gardners and free. WHoever designed it has a superb eye for plant form, leave shapes and textures and color. It is free and parking is on the street next to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1203NOjanes
50,Awesome lights,"We have been to a few neighborhoods to see the Christmas lights but Enchanted at the Descanso Gardens was amazing! The tickets are a bit pricey but there isn’t a crowd like there is at the neighborhood light displays. There are a few snack bars to purchase hot chocolate, apple cider, s’mores, popcorn, etc. it will take an hour or two to see the all the lights. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking and it is not all paved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678trishk
50,Awesome Light show,"We were visiting my sister and brother in law and they told us about this Holiday light show. We went and it was awesome. There were 10 different areas to look at and interact with. If I'm in California next year, I will for sure go there again. The light displays were so inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7076ZGnancyd
50,Enchanted Forest at Descanso Gardens:-),Fabulous evening walking tour of the lights and interactive light displays:-) So beautiful and well worth the $30 price for the ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2trade

50,Light show,The gardens were alight with 10 different areas showcasing various thems. Well worth a visit. Great fun for children with interactive exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanMason
50,Enchanted Forest was the highlight of my hoiday season,"Some dear friends and I met for dinner and then walked it off in the Enchanted Forest of Light. Next year I am inviting more friends and a much longer time to enjoy this magical land. I really enjoyed the sights, sounds and smells of everything going on there. Absolutely first class and so many chances and choices for delight. HIGHLY recommend it! Only thing was most people (my guests included) weren't dressed appropriately for the cold. LAYER people, layer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg
50,Great Dinner at Descanso Gardens,"Went to the Enchanted: Forest of Light at Descanso before Christmas and decided to try Maple Restaurant for dinner before walking through the gardens. Knowing it was a Patina restaurant set the expectation for good food. Upon arriving at the restaurant the ambiance was a little off putting since it was bright lights and bare bones decor. We learned that Maple is not usually open for dinner but they do meetings and special events while Patina also runs the Cafe Descanso on site.The food went beyond our expectations. Everything we tried from salmon to vegetables to dessert was amazing. Truly delicious food.Also our meal was made special by the attention we received from the manager, Oliver. He was an amazing host. He could not have been nicer and looked after us unbelievably well. His customer service was impeccable and he made our evening so enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilltarinw
30,Relatively inexpensive $9 but not much there at least in December,"entrance fee is relatively low at nine dollars but there was not much there in december during the day at least. the reviews i have read for their night lights, for which entrance fee is much more expensive, have not been that great either. there was a lot of greenery but not many flowers. good for hike in quiet place through greenery; lot of paved walkways so good for handicapped and other people who do not want to walk on rough trails. may be spring is a better time to do there but huntington gardens had much better flowers and variety though it costs thirty dollars; guess you get what you pay for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PULAOKHAO
50,Enchanting Enchanted Garden,"You really can't judge the Enchanted Garden exhibit from photos or videos. It's truly amazing and a must-see. Although you can eat dinner at the onsite restaurant Maple ($120 for two people) there are plenty of opportunities to eat in the park (chili, hamburgers, etc)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobFromTarzana
30,Expected more,"I visited Descanso Gardens back in February 2017 with my husband and our three year old daughter. I expected much more from the Gardens, they were just okay, quiet underwhelming actually compared to other nearby famous gardens. the best part was the Japanese Gardens, and the little train ride was a hit with our daughter (you do have to pay extra for that one). I never visited in the Spring, so it could be more scenic in the Spring?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souseyeh
40,Enchanted Forest of Lights Event,This was our first time seeing the Forest of Lights and it was well worth it. Each of the exhibits were beautifully done and some offered interactive elements for kids and adults alike. You should definitely buy tickets early because they do sell out. Also dress warmly as you will be outside for the evening. This is a fantastic new way to experience the garden and nature in general. Good stuff!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyD342
30,Probably best in the springtime,"Hmm.. I've got mixed feelings over this garden, some areas were good others not so but read on! Firstly it was not that well signposted but that is not necessarily the fault of the garden. We drove a reasonably short way from Glendale & knew the general direction but only saw one road sign pointing to the garden. However, on arrival we found a large parking lot & friendly staff on the admissions desk. There is a good gift shop to one's right & on the left is the café. I think the negative side of my review is probably down to the hot, dry weather of the summer. The area towards the south, the oak woodland & California natives area, was very dry & dusty & some of the plants were suffering as a result of drought. Saying that they'll probably recover over the winter with cooler, wetter weather. In addition to the paved pathways there are a number of tracks through the woodland & also a good number seats. One area that did disappoint was the rose garden & this was rather untidy, the grass needed a trim & the rose beds a weed. On the positive side we found the ancient forest area excellent. I would imagine come springtime the lilac garden & camellia areas will be stunning. Another highlight was the Boddy House, where one can view the downstairs rooms along with a art exhibit in an adjoining building.Please don't let some of my rather negative comments put you off visiting though as with any garden there is no 'best' time to visit, there is something to see every month of the year, whatever the weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideH1785AO
50,An Enchanting evening at Descanso Gardens,"Thanks to good food, great company, stunning lights and the super moon, we had an amazing time at the Enchanted Forest @ Descanso Gardens. Though not exactly what I thought it would be (not particularly holiday themed, ala The LA ZOO), it has its own special magic. With an ethereal, meditative soundtrack, our journey through the 'forest' was filled with awe and wonder.Treat yourself and those you love to a thrilling experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singingbackup
50,Great way to spend a holiday evening,"We went to Descanso Gardens “ enchanted Forrest “ the first weekend of December .I purchased the ticket online a month or so in advance to celebrate my parents 61st Anniversary.There were 6 of us , ages ranging from 81 to 26 . No matter the age , we all completely enjoyed walking through the lighted gardens .We loved all the interactive displays .We took about 2 hours to walk through, we had plenty of time to stop at each display and take photos .While there were plenty of people , we did not feel crowded or rushed .Our tickets were for 8:30 PM , there were some children , but not many , the few we encountered , seemed to be enjoying .While my parents are in there 80’s , they didn’t seem to have an issue with the walking . Although I did notice the paths were uneven in many areas and it is rather dark .Absolutely, dress warm , we thought we did , but everyone in our party was cold . Think , scarf, beanie& gloves .I highly recommend, this was a truly unique evening .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandeeS258

50,Enchanted forest was a hoot,"Descanso Gardens has an evening special event in late November and December. The light show was spectacular and the gardens are transformed in a very special place. Tickets are not inexpensive, we paid $30 each, but it was well worth it. Tickets should be purchased in advance. There were people trying to purchase tickets at the box office and were told to go on line to buy tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,SUPER COOL Experience,"During the Holiday's, Descanso Gardens features an amazing light show which can be observed via a walk throughout the property.In addition to being great exercise, its also an amazing light shows and LED display via a series of exhibits on the grounds.Its kind of hard to put in words, but a quick Google search will answer all your questions.Its a great way to spend the evening when visiting Pasadena, Glendale or Los Angeles.

40,Nice morning activity,We had plans most of the day so this filled in our morning gap. At $9 it was good to walk around this small garden and feel like you had seen almost everything. The Boddy House and the gallery weren't open which was disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741susane

The pumpkin 🎃 carvings were spectacular. Hope they bring the Jack O Lanterns back again this year at this location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marisalovestraveling
40,A nice day of walking trails,"We enjoy going to the Descanso Gardens. A membership is pricey for what it is I think... so unfortunately we've never been able to afford a membership, but we've been the guests of friends of ours who are members. It is full of different kinds of gardens and fountains. It's very lovely. I also enjoy the little cafe. I wish there was a playground somewhere on the grounds. That would push this over the top to 5 stars. I did enjoy when they made a little kids maze out of hay bails for Halloween. That was very cool. We saw deer here as well! That was awesome! There is a museum in the back that we haven't seen yet, but I'm looking forward to that.If a membership was more affordable I would definitely become a member.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
20,Maple Restaurant at Descanso,"Ate here today. Very pricey for food that was mediocre. The service was slow. We ordered the sorbet for dessert and it took forever...asked for a glass of ice and that took forever...the omelette was abominably plain, and there was not even any attempt on presentation. I do not recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arknwarrior
30,Nice walking trails,This garden is lovely. It's a pretty good value for the costs. The gift shop has some really fun little things too. We went in June and a lot of the flowers/plants were out of season so it was not at pretty as it could be. I would check their website ahead of time to see what is in bloom. There is a cherry. Blossom festival in the spring that is supposed to be lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishakelley
50,A Day at Descanso Gardens,"I visited Descanso Gardens this past spring. Being new to Los Angeles, I knew I would miss the Cherry Blossom trees that annually bloom back home in the Washington, DC area. However, I found out that Descanso Gardens actually had Cherry Blossoms in the spring. Cherry Blossom trees have a peak blooming time and I read that tickets to see them at Descanso Gardens sell out quickly so you have to purchase early. This was true. In addition, there are times for members to enter and view them as well as times for non-members to come and view them.When I purchased my tickets, I didn't know what a treat I was in for. There was so much more than Cherry Blossoms! There was a tulip garden, a rose garden, a Chinese garden with Koi fish, an orange grove and a lake. There was also giant cactuses a lake and a stream. Finally, there was an small art gallery and the Boddy House, home of the creator of Descanso Gardens, which has been turned into a museum.Descanso Gardens also has an amphitheater for performances. I spent about 3 hours walking through the gardens, visiting the art gallery and exploring the Boddy House. I could have certainly spent more time there. It's a beautiful and relaxing place to visit. I would definitely recommend it for children, adults, senior or couples. I took great pictures and will definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyD12345
40,A peaceful walk,"This a place to spend few hours of the day peacefully as its not crowded. The kids get ample space to run around and play. The map helps one to track ones path and what all one wish to see. There are flowers and tree around with a little waterfall and pond being made. There are sitting places every now and then where one can sit and rest from walk. There is a House at top which has a nice architecture. There is ample of parking space. Make sure one needs to have good walking shoes, water and lots of food (if kids are there) to enjoy your walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
50,Relaxing day,"This is an easy place to spend a half day or just to drop in. The grounds are beautifully maintained with walking paths, ponds, waterfalls, wonderful landscaping and a home that serves as a museum/artist gallery. They have a great gift shop and a lunch area on the premises. Also, look into their special programs and education programs for adults and children. There is a wonderful tea house and benches to rest throughout. Don't miss a visit here. Lots of parking and memberships available for year round visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnkbrown
30,July is the wrong time of the year,Visited in July This is a garden that specializes in Camellias should be visited during the late winter. Otherwise there is not much to keep things interesting. I find they do not water enough to keep plants healthy In february I am sure my review would be different . I will say I loved their Japanese garden Otherwise everything was so so,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArizonaTraveler56
50,Perfect City Escape,"There were so many plants, flowers, and trees to see, along with a waterfall and ponds that had turtles! We found some small trails near the back, which made exploring the grounds a lot more fun! Make sure to grab a map when you walk in, otherwise it can get pretty confusing. When you walk in and go towards the Boddy House, theres a section of plants that have some pretty funny names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishelle719
50,"Gorgeous, peaceful place that soothes the soul","We Loved walking in the gardens. There is so much to see including plants, flowers, trees and numerous water features.

40,Take in the beautiful gardens as well as wildlife!,"This is a unique garden set amongst a nice housing tract. Lots of plants to see as well as taking in a tour of the The Boddy House on the premises. Paved trails with lots of off paved trails as well. We went early 9:30 am Sunday to avoid crowds. Lots of free parking and easily off the freeway with big signage to follow. There are some steep hills to climb. We came across a doe with her two young ones following, geese, a snake crossing a trail, turtles, koi fish and lots of squirrels. There is a miniature train to take and it's pretty cool. Kids get a kick out of it. It only goes in a small circle for about 7 minutes. The Boddy House is a self guided tour. There is a cafe on the premises as well as restrooms throughout the gardens. All of the fauna is well maintained with identification tags of plants and trees. It took approximately 2 hours to walk around the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
50,A Hidden Gem,"A lovely garden, set in a residential neighborhood in La Canada, just north of Downtown Los Angeles.

It's less than $10 to get in and you can spend hours there, you can even picnic outside the venue. You can check their website to see which flowers are blooming for each month. I recommend buying tickets online during the summer months and on the weekends to avoid the admission lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alli_sun_t
50,"What a beautiful, magical place!","I can't believe in all my years of living nearby, I've never been to this garden until now. I went last weekend with my fiancé and I was almost overwhelmed with how beautiful everything was. The Japanese garden was so cute, the Lilac garden, the art gallery, I could go on. There's endless places to walk around and soak up nature. The gardens are very well taken care of and they have a nice restaurant up front. I think I may have found the place where I want to get married. Go here. You won't be sorry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merrvgokings
50,Splendor and Natural Beauty,"The first time I arrived at Descanso Gardens was several years ago as a crew member on a low budget TV show. The first thing you should see is the Japanese Garden area. It is quite magnificent. There is a bridge that overlooks a small stream with huge goldfish. Also, take a stroll through the huge rose garden area over to the wildlife pond which is home to swans, ducks, a crane or two, and dozens of fresh water turtles. As you leave have the kids touch the 300 year old Oak tree. The Bodhi house showcases art of all kinds and during summer you can take walking tours at night to observe all the creepy crawlers. Small ones will love the tiny train that you can ride. So much more than just a garden or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddyb1968
40,"Very pleasant gardens, with many Camellias and Lilacs","Very nice to tour through. The camellias were just starting to bloom when we visite; the lilacs looked to be almost done blooming. I guess we timed that incorrectly!There are a couple of lakes/ponds and there ducks, Canadian Geese and other birds to be easily seen. We saw a pair of Canadian geese with three goslings hatched on site.Lots of shade when walking the paths. There are wheelchairs available to borrow. The gift shop is well stocked and they have live plants and some succulents, native Californian and others, available to purchase in the gift shop's oudoor patio.Was pretty busy when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. I imagine it might be quieter on a weekday.Recommended, especially if you like easy nature walks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713lmd

There is a small gauge train to ride. Kids would love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/windiveski
50,"perfect size of the park, cheap admission and the train!","First time to this garden cause heard the beautiful cherry blossoms. It is very beautiful, but we should go 2 weeks early and it will be more prettier. The garden has the perfect size for my family, a lot of plants and road, a little bit hills, some small ponds with fishes, turtles, etc. We arrived 11am to catch the 45mins guided tour (recommend to buy the tickets online advance) then wondered by ourselves till 5 o'clock. The entrance closed at 4 but they will let you stay till 5. We were able to go each site and not extremely tired. The train is a plus, it is short but super fun $3 at the front gate and wait is probably about 30-40 mins. Don't want to wait then do it early, lines were longer at PM. Rose garden is pretty but they do lock the fence/gate at 4 so go there early. We packed our lunch but cafe at the main entrance is not very expense. no outside food is allowed in the park, there is a drinking water fountain next to the train station. Drinks - as long as you have a lid they will allow you carry in. General admission is only $9 adult and $4 for 5-12 kids, free under 5. Very fare price for a whole family to hang out for a day in the beautiful nature environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734oliviah

50,A beautiful place to visit,"I spent about 2 hours here and really enjoyed it. I visited in the Spring, after a lot of rain, so the cherry blossom and roses were beautiful.

Lots of free parking too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dude_IN_LosAngeles
50,Go in the Spring,"This was our first visit in 15 years and we enjoyed the visit. It is spring and the entire place is enveloped in color. Tulips, Iris, lilac, poppy, camellias, roses, the list goes on. It is something like 80 acres and two buildings toward the back contain art galleries which we enjoyed. Toward the entry, it's mostly level, toward the back, it's up and down, but not many places that are steep and then not very steep. The California Natives are toward the back. There is a large lake with a bird watch station and some smaller bodies of water. A few structure are scattered with many places to sit. It could use a few more drinking fountains and a little more water pressure and maybe a few more restrooms. The Japanese Garden was attractive and popular. A cute little train ride circles a section but by 1:00, the line was about 45 minutes long so we skipped it. There are a number of botanical gardens around Los Angeles and I think this may be the nicest, I'm just not sure why it took so long to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,Beautiful public park and Oak woodland,"A great visit any time and especially attractive in the spring after a good rainy season. Cherry blossoms abound and seasonal flowers are always present tended by a professional staff of greens men and women. A botanical garden some 20-miles from downtown Los Angeles which charges a modest fee for entry. There is a gift shop which includes some plants for sale a narrow gauge railroad (additional small charge) A bird observation station next to a small lake and a casual restaurant. Also included is a rose garden native California plant section, oak woodland, and large stands of azaleas and camellias. There is a beautiful Japanese garden and much more.

50,Lovely place to walk,"My daughter took me here because she knows I love gardens...The price is quite good by the way. The Japanese garden has a bridge that is orange. The camellia were out in bloom and the petals falling making a lovely effect on the ground. The cherry trees were a canopy of whitish pink over head. The Lilac garden was almost in full bloom... If we had not gotten there around 3 I could have spent a few more hours there but they closed at 5 and we had to leave.I highly recommend this garden for its cool pathways, inviting stream and vibrant color.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/02corvette

40,"Camelias, cherry blossom, tulips","Our first time and we really enjoyed. The cherry blossoms were still somewhat in bloom, and we enjoyed our picnic lunch in the Japanese garden. So many camelias in such pretty colors. You can read the history of how Mr. Boddy bought all the nurseries out of all camelia plants decades ago. Interesting to see the restored Boddy house and garage converted into art gallery.A large tulip display was also magnificent and we enjoyed the various trails and garden sections. We enjoyed our lunch picnic and afternoon there. We also hiked a bit up the mountain beyond the Hope garden, above the Boddy house. Nice olive trees growing there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GigiMontclair_NJ
50,Lovely way to spend the day!,"We went for the cherry blossom festival, but you should go right now! The cherries are blooming, the bulbs are blooming, the camellias continue to bloom, and you can see the wonderful products of all of the water we've had this winter!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298anitap
50,Like a dream come true,"I adored this place. It is exquisite. We came for the camellias but would love to come back in March, April for peak season. The rose garden is huge, the Japanese garden was breathtaking. Just such a gorgeous place so much to see. The Boddy house was lovely and interesting. Would have loved if the art gallery was open. I would love to retire here and spend every day in this magical place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PLANTATREEORDIE
40,Great Place,Nice place to take the kids and walk around...Nice cafe and beautiful gardens that are made over seasonable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
40,Cherry Blossom festival,"Large crowds here for the festival this weekend. Daffodils, tulips and lots of cherry blossoms. A band was set up to play but we did not stay to hear it. There are clean restrooms and a nice cafe here. Plenty of parking and easy access to freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRM13
50,Cherry Blossom Festival,Well...for starters they only have two or three trees in bloom and frankly I didn't see many more...but...they've got thousands of camellias in bloom and they're just gorgeous! A wonderful place to go for a walk...really well maintained...and we had a great time. I'd recommend this highly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
50,Lovely afternoon walk,"I went during their Enchanted Forest evening. It was lovely with the whole garden lit up like a fantasy (only at certain times). I went by myself and I would have you save it for when you go with date or with kids. As an older person, I kept having to watch the walkway ( next time I'll bring a flashlight). The walkways are well maintained but because of the light show it is dark. For a first timer, I suggest you go to the gardens in the daytime and in spring. Right now the Cherry Blossoms are blooming and while the weekends are sold out, if you can get up there on a weekday it's a beautiful sight at the Japanese Gardens. Go up by the little lake, they have refreshments and drinks. Relax and spend the day. The camellias are blooming too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
50,Beautiful Gardens,Beautiful grounds and flowers everywhere. Camellias are the specialty but their gardens are spectacular The E Msnchester Boddy house built in 1930 is a main attraction and has been used in a number of films. They feature year round events and the entry price is a fraction of other venues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
40,A lovely walk,"We went in the winter, so not many flowers, but it was still a nice walk through beautiful trees and gave a wonderful opportunity to step away from city living. Can't wait for the blooms when I go back in the spring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaitlinR0se
50,Valentines date,"Excellent, what a day to spend our day, lots sunshine, lots of camellias with different colors, just gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/752lanid
50,Gorgeous & Calming - Oasis outside of LA,"This place is amazing for so many reasons and it evolves throughout the year. As different plants/flowers are in season the place becomes a new terrain of beauty. From the Rose Garden, to the Lilacs, to going this past weekend for a Camellia Tea Event (while everything else is still pretty dead). There's always something to admire in this place and a fun little treat is the train ride for the kiddos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimbot87
50,Gret Place to Roam and Enjoy Beauty,"I had not gone to Descanso Gardens for many, many years, but I had remembered the experience from that long lost past and was delighted to see that the Gardens is still a great place to go. On a pleasant afternoon, we wandered the many paths, strolled around the ponds and toured the residence. Every place was charming, and sitting and relaxing on the many benches helped make the visit even more nourishing for our souls.January is probably the worst month to visit a place like this, but we loved our visit, nonetheless and look forward to returning in the spring or autumn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6953YVpaull
40,It's Winter Folks,"It was a nice hike at probably the worst time of year. Not many blooms ... saw a lot of skeletons; the arbors, bare trees, etc. $9 each ... and we'd do it again. The Mansion was quite amazing. We do want to go again, maybe in the spring and fall. I overheard my wife telling friends and family over her phone, about our adventure ... so I'm sure I scored some ""guy points,"" haha. The gift shop was nice; we took home a beautiful, large, colorful flowery window hanging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sjfreedom
30,Enchanting - maybe,"After seeing the light garden at the Denver Botanical Gardens we were excited to go to this one thinking it would be somewhat the same experience. Not so. It was great fun for kids to run around through the trees and jump on lights. The rambunctiousness was too much for us. The idea of a quiet stroll was out the window. The only lights we enjoyed were the ones that were set up high in the trees. Needless to say it was a disappointment. Hard to enjoy something with shouts, screams and running in and out around you. I'm sure it was fun for families that were expecting that but not for couples. And the parking was terrible. Be careful when walking as the ground was uneven.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnU162
50,Enchanted Evening,"While,it's too late for this year book next year's Enchanted Forest This evening walk through the gardens is worth the 28 dollar price of admission to see the lights great for couples and for families with children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552StevenA
20,Unenchanted evening in the forest!,"We received tickets to the Enchanted Forest of Light and drove up from Orange County on a Saturday evening at 8:00. There is not nearly enough parking at Descanso Gardens and we ended parking on the street 3/4 of a mile away. The line to get in took about 15 minutes to negotiate but the check in process did go smoothly.The show is very disappointing, basically colored lights illuminating the trees and shrubs and hanging colored lights. Nothing spectacular, inspiring, or breath-taking. Paths have no marking and no illumination so there's not way to see the standing puddles and mud. Worse, the lights were often aimed at eye level making it impossible to see the walkways.One area with tulip shaped lights that changed colors was interesting.Could have been worse...it could have been raining.All in all not much to see for $24 senior rate and certainly no worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65oski
50,Enchanted: Forest of Lights was Outstanding!,"What a wonderful display of beautiful lights. They did such a fantastic job I want to see the whole garden during the day.This is great for couples, kids and everyone in between.The only thing I would say they could improve on is the directions and ground lighting. It was at times a little difficult to know what direction to go.I Would definitely go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendya01
50,Enchanted Forest of Light,"This only runs for a short time in the winter. We visited in December at about 8pm and the tickets said ""rain or shine"", well it rained, awesome! But I feel it only added to our experience and made for some cool pictures. Bring good shoes, warm jackets and possibly an umbrella. The time on your ticket is when they allow you to enter. If you arrive early, check out the gift shop or cafe to the left of it. The map is hard to read at night but you'll have no trouble finding each location, just follow the crowds. Each installation was so beautiful but the lily pads were the best. Worth the muddy shoes and frizzy hair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/criskeys
50,Beautiful in any season,"Near Pasadena are the lovely Descanso Gardens. It's amazing how much beauty and botanical variety is available in such a small space without t all seeming crowded. Amidst the bustle of freeways, close housing, roaring traffic, this oasis surrounds you with peace. Though the rose garden is featured, I preferred the camellias and the Oak woodlands. Who knew there were so many varieties and they were so different from each other. A steep hike (thankfully short) takes you to the wonderful Boddy house, beautifully restored and decorated with an interesting history of the garden's benefactor and founder, Boddy. The Haaga gallery provides a short course on Japanese gardens. Well worth a visit to decompress from the urban fenzy. Note_ the cafe not so great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKT0707
40,Enchanted Forest of Light,"Visited in December and it was BEAUTIFUL! I loved the different lights and the decorations. It wasn't necessarily Christmas decorations, but more reds, blues and greens. There were different areas that showcased different activities. One of the areas you could step on circles in the ground and the circle would change color. Very interactive! Great for Adults and children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyg554
50,Loved Enchanted: Forest of Light,"I was recently in Los Angeles for a few days, and was looking for something different to do. Stumbled upon this, and was so glad I went! Loved all the different light displays, and the interactive aspects as well. It was a perfect thing to do during the holidays, especially walking around with a hot mulled cider in your hand.You buy your ticket online in advance, since they're all timed entries. Parking lot onsite, which was pretty full the night I was there. Beautiful homes on the drive up to the gardens too.I'd love to come back to the gardens the next time I'm in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atljs
50,Enchanted Forest of Light,"Two adults. Two boys. We all found it magical, all for different reasons. There was a lot of room to play; a lot of room to explore. Finding your way around was easy. Beautiful lighting gave ethereal experiences. Could get food and drink along the way. Inexpensive and immersive. Cannot wait to do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaMichaels1214
50,Enchanted Forest of Light -- fabulous for all ages,"We went to Descanso Gardens to see their Enchanted Forest of Light show. It’s fabulous! -- not what I expected. There were many little children there (along with the large numbers of adults). In additional to the fantastic lights there are interactive displays where children (and adults) can manipulate things like lights in the lawn by walking on raised disks and sounds by stroking rods in the Sycamores. The children were thrilled with what they could do in the interactive sections and fascinated by the lights that provided a variety of special effects in the forests and groves. Along with the children (a few in strollers), there were adults who were also strolling through the areas and enjoying the evening. Even non-walkers can enjoy the sites at a leisurely pace.• Along the way there are stops where you can sit and enjoy a beverage and snack• The gift shop is special, packed with holiday items and some great stocking-stuffers.• Parking seems to be difficult at times due to the large crowds.• Dress warm -- it's chilly in the forests at night.• When we were there we were told that weekends had been sold out, they pace the crowds by selling tickets for specific times.• This is well worth the admission fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
50,Worth a visit,This was one of the gardens in los Angeles that we had not seen. They have kept the gardens as they were but added an iĺluminated walk for Xmas. Spent an enjoyable 3 hours here. Catering facilities weren't great & expensive. The Bossy museum was interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbybill1945
50,I love this place any time of the year,"Descanso Gardens has been a special place for me for years. I'm a photographer and the garden is filled with photo opportunities, really any time of the year. Spring is best because of all the flowers, but there is always something to see and enjoy at the gardens. On many weekends they have special shows. When we were there it featured chrysanthemums. There are wooded areas to walk, a Japanese Garden, in the spring amazing lilacs, California oaks with seemingly thousands of camellias in various colors, a large rose garden and more.Go there to get away from hectic LA and enjoy serenity, quiet and beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/608billg
50,A Garden For All Seasons,"I and my wife just went to the ""Enchanted: Forest of Light."" Imagination and creativity mark this walk through this part of the park for the Christmas holidays. What we enjoyed the most were the children under 8 years of age who were excited and delighted with the lights and the walk through the trees at night with the different lights.But we had gone in the spring to view the many colorful flower gardens whose variety and hues of colors were most picturesque. There is also a Garden and Souvenir Shop with many items for both gardeners and children.Check it out please!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2871JYrobertm
50,Enchanted: Forest of Light,Amazing! Great family experience. Hot coco food and coffee available. I would definitely recommend this for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgemaxson
50,The Original Tarzan did filming here.,I remember my Mother taking me here when I was young... telling me this was where much of Tarzan was filmed. The rose garden is always one of my favorite parts of the gardens and in every direction there are photo worthy opportunities. The preservation of what this land looked like for centuries is humbling and this is a very special place in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silvatungfox
40,Enchanted lights worth the trip out,Spent a beautiful evening walking around this beautiful setting at night. They have done a skillful job of turning this outdoor daytime venue into a enchanted night time adventure. The lights and light shows are very fun for kids and adults and they have lots of liquid refreshments along the way as well s some snacks for kids or adults. It evening air was delightful and this is a wonderful way to start your holiday season or to get u In The mood of the season. U can spend as little as one hour here or longer lingering at the little bars or just enjoy people watching in the cold. Come bundled up stay away and enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Needlepointaddict
40,Relaxing environment,We visited on a whim with family members who live nearby on our trip out to visit for Thanksgiving. We decided against the hustle and bustle of seeing and doing too much to instead experience some local hidden gems. This did not disappoint and was just what we needed. Great gift shop and kids and adults all loved the hours we spent here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933calebd
40,"Beautiful Gardens, Great Variety, Mediteranean Climate","Two of us toured the facility on a recent mid-week morning. The gardens are beautifully maintained and have nice walking trails both paved and unpaved throughout the various ""zones"" of the gardens. Of particular beauty were the Japanese gardens and the California Woodland areas.. particularly due to the early morning sun light filtering through the trees. Located in a suburban hillside area the outer walkways do have some change in elevation with a few vistas. There are many places to just sit and enjoy the plants and flowers. One area is quite brown as it is not being watered and demonstrates the effect of the prolonged drought impacting Southern California. Something for guests to understand and for locals to get used to. The rose gardens were expansive and had many varieties. The gift shop was full of festive items and some plant materials for sale.We were there about 3 hours which permitted a leisurely walk and some sitting in some favorite places. Arriving by car seemed the primary mode. If you are a member of a horticulture society elsewhere you may get break on the entrance fees, which are reasonable anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5026OSjohng
50,An amazing display of beautiful flowers and landscaping,"I recently visited the Descanso Gardens on Sunday, October 30th for their Visitor Feedback day. My mother had visited before and told me such amazing details of the area that I was excited to go, and I was not disappointed. The gardens are very large, with a variety of different kinds of plants, flowers and landscaping. There is a lake in the back portion of the Gardens that had duck and geese, but also large koi fish and lots of snapping turtles. My personal favorite area was the Japanese garden - the flowers there were so lovely and with the ponds, bridges and statues it was so tranquil and peaceful.This is a definite place to visit whether you are a Southern California native or just here for a visit. I will definitely be going back in March for their Cherry Blossom festival. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishsiren32
40,"History, Gardens and Strolling!","We had some time before a business meeting in the area.

There is also a Cafe if you need a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneH563
50,Community Central,"We visited in October when the spring blooms were over, but the garden was properly festooned for fall with pumpkin and gourd displays everywhere. It is obviously very important with local people, many of whom took their young children for fun activities and a miniature railroad that tours around the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171maryjaned
50,Great escape from Los Angeles busy life,"I don't know anything better around Glendale. It's good to visit with family, discover many plants... the train is very funny too... there are ponds, many rare plants, flowers... and fresh air..I was surprised to see Mulberry tree there..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bureacrate
50,Gardens of all seasons,"There is always something interesting to see here as you stroll through the various gardens. I come here often. I love the art presentations, the Japanese gardens, the camellias, lilacs, California native gardens, fountains, gift shop and more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynmac52
20,Kind of.... dead,"This place has a lot of potential. Maybe I visited during a bad time, during the hottest months of the summer. Regardless, I can't recommend it. My wife and I spent a few hours among the gardens, but felt like we missed the attractions. Everything just seemed to be suffering from the drought, barely alive let alone vibrant or attractive.The old mansion on-site is fun to check out, but not enough to make up for the lackluster gardens.I hope my experience was a fluke, because Descanso Gardens seems like it could be a truly beautiful property. Sadly, with memories of impressive gardens in Chicago, Phoenix, Vanocuver, and beyond, Descanso Gardens is a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/974russellw
50,Beautiful!,Several beautifulgarden areas to enjoy and seasonal events including stage productions can be enjoyed here as well. A small café and the gift shop are worth a visit. This is one place not to be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsea2010
50,Beautiful Grounds and some Easy Hiking Trails,"Not as much variety, perhaps, as Huntington Gardens, however it was a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The little outdoor cafe was enjoyable too. Great place for children, they even had a little train ride around the grounds. The Boddy House was a nice glimpse into the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohhHoward
50,Many areas to enjoy,"My daughter and I spent about 2 hours exploring the gardens, Boddy House and the weaving exhibit at Descanso Gardens. We were fortunate to have passes that got us in without paying. While we enjoyed our visit, I'm not sure I'd have paid $9 apiece for it.The Japanese garden area is small but nice with beautiful reflecting ponds, a pretty orange bridge and blue-roofed teahouse. There's also a rose garden (which was past its prime during our visit but still pretty). The shop is also worthy of a visit and has many reasonably priced items.There's plenty to see here. Do wear sturdy shoes if you plan to visit Boddy House and/or the art exhibit, as it's a bit of an uphill walk to these areas. Also, don't miss the beautiful living wall behind the art exhibit area across from Boddy House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanAndJim
30,Average,"It is a nice park in a quiet beautiful neighbourhood, but nothing really special. Rather for the Boddy house a regular public park is much more beautiful. In addition they charge USD 9 for entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoy555

40,Oasis of tranquility near metro LA,"I was given a membership for Christmas, which allows me to bring one guest.At least twice a month, I invite my friends to come and walk with me and talk, instead of eating something high calorie at a restaurant while we chat. You can do the perimeter in about 45 minutes- during which time, depending on the season, you pass through the Ancient forest of cycads and redwood trees, or lilac grove, camelias, tulips, the English rose garden with gazebo, cacti, authentic Japanese garden with koi ponds, the farm garden, the oak trees and lawns. You can stay in the shade or choose more sun. There is water flowing also- the fountain, the little streams, the ponds. Ducks are sometimes around. Membership gets you in at 8 a.m., perfect time before most people arrive. . Once I was with someone that saw a deer. The Boddy House opens at 10 a.m. and is a lovely example of the 1940's high-society household. This is a little-known gem within 15 minutes of Pasadena or Glendale. There is an outdoor cafe, and they have evening events as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaF1953
40,A beautiful place to visit.,"I have a season pass and enjoy going there at diffeent time of the year. There is always something blooming.They have a good gift store but I do not think there coffee/lunch counter is as good as it could be, and it is also expensive, so I never plan on lunch or coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456LTR

50,Descanso Gardens - a rural yet refined,"Imagine being in LA, and then transported to a serene urban woodland area nestled in and around the San Rafael Hills near Pasadena and La Canada Flintridge, CA.At 160 acres, it's slightly larger than Disneyland and California Adventure combined. There are half a dozen botany areas - Rose Garden, Japanese Garden, ancient forest of tree ferns -- ancient, but added in 2015, Vast camellia gardens that bloom all year round, a California native garden, a harvest garden used for enrichment classes for toddlers. All these are 5-10 acres in size/ leaving a huge area of oak woodland and oak forest.It is so not like a super structured garden, they are careful to make the woodlands and forests look as they should -- quite natural. Wonderful walking paths, too.There is a restaurant, gift shop, historic 1930's house built by the property owner, an art studio, and little buildings and natural nooks where classes for all ages are taught. There is a train too.Hours 9-5, but some evening events go to 7 or later (music, movies, etc.), so check the schedule.I was there for an evening program called End Of Summer Festival, from 5-10 p.m. Aug 3. Music,Crafts, food, wine and beer, and at sunset, stargazing. The gardens normally close at 5 p.m. so it was cool and tranquil in the evening as the sun set and the stars and planets came out.You could enjoy a shorter visit of a couple hours, or do some, then have lunch and gift shop, then more gardens, or split it up over many visits. Admission is a reasonable $9, with many membership and volunteer opportunities. I think I am in love <3",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astrojane
50,Summertime Event,"This was our second visit to the Gardens (live about 90 mins away) and based on an article in our local paper decided to visit one of the summertime events, Lakeside Lounge. It was very nice, even though one of the hottest days of the summer. We brought our own chairs and recommend since there is limited seating. The only complaint I have is the paper stated, no outside food (picnic) was allowed for this event. However, many people brought food, coolers, even fast food bags. Food was available for purchase. I believe they should reevalutate this and decide to either state food may be brought in or enforce the policy. Although the food for purchase was good, we could have brought our own cheese, crackers, etc and enjoyed as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanT56737
40,A fun walk,"We enjoyed the expansive and well maintained gardens here. It was good to see in July but I think it is better to go in the spring when the flowers are blooming. We saw many plants but very few flowers due to the time of year. We also went on a Monday when many of the exhibits (gallery and the house) and the train were closed. So if you are visiting, Monday is probably not the best day to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GKayY56
40,Nice Park!,"Descanso Gardens in La Canada is a nice park/garden to come to on a summer day....the gardens are pretty, there's a little pond, and several park areas to walk around in.

So many places to hold the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception.

50,A wonderful place to visit!,"Descanso Gardens is a beautiful place to visit. Once inside the gardens, one truly feels like one is no longer in Los Angeles. The gardens are quiet and peaceful. There are both paved paths to walk on, as well as dirt paths. Different flowers are planted in one of the main areas of the garden during different seasons. The rose garden is spectacular. Many people bring their young children there and the kids always enjoy seeing the ducks in the pond, running around on the large grass field, or up and down the paths. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamd305
50,A truly lovely way to spend the day!,"Descanso Gardens is one of the most peaceful, rejuvenating locations in all of Los Angeles. Most of the pathways are shaded by large trees (mostly oak and redwood), which makes it pleasant to walk around even in the hot summer temperatures. The pathways wind around the gardens taking you through lilac gardens, rose gardens, a Japanese garden, California native plants, 100,000 camellia plants, wildflowers, and more.Need some peace and rejuvenation with time to reflect and relax? Descanso Gardens is the perfect setting. Do yourself a favor and go! Put your cell phone away (unless you're taking pictures to remember how beautiful these plants are), put your watch in your pocket, and take a leisurely stroll around. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoggyShore
30,Nice garden for spring viewing,"The Descanso garden has a variety of garden displays, from more European bedding gardens to Asian garden displays. We were disappointed on our visit in early May because most of the gardens were not blooming (camellia, lilac). The smallish rose garden had completed its first flush of blooms; unfortunately because the roses had not been deadheaded, there were no new blooms to see. Overall a garden in need of more volunteers to maintain the place at peak display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej
50,Serenity and tranquility escape in the middle of the city.,"The concept to build and maintain a diverse echo garden like Descanso in the middle of the city is a grand ambitious project on massive scale. This is a wonderful story of success and continuity. The garden is a living proof that human intervention can help bring awareness and harmony to visitors. Every time I visit the garden, I am moved and inspired. I highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834emada

40,Another world outside of LA,"Happened to visit on the annual ""Tomatomania"" event-busy even though we arrived before noon with very long lines shortly after that. I'd recommend coming as early in the day as possible, preferably not on an ""Special Event"" day ( check their website-we didn't!). Lovely and diverse acres of natural gardens, much more spread out and larger than expected. Also has a house to tour on the grounds ( just a few rooms open to the public about the family who donated it and its history and a small art gallery with changing exhibitions. Bring a picnic or buy lunch at the small cafe near the entrance and enjoy the many shaded areas and benches.Worth the trip - also good for active kids with lots of space to move around. Not so good for people with mobility issues due to unpaved and steep paths, although it's large enough that everyone can find some areas that are suitable and navigable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wellscare
50,Feery Tale,"Even the long line of cars, no parking availability in that big and usually not that croudy parking spaces could'n stop us! We circled the streets and found a space. It all worth the awesome beauty we came in!! Cherry blossom, tulips with all imagine colors, and especially Lilacs!!! Camellia trees were all covered with the flyovers already also. And the main treasure is the AIR- fresh, full of aromas of all , even tiny grass! You just seat there or take a long walks and drink that breezy air!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716venusp

50,Stop and Smell the Roses!,"After living in California for over 50 years, I finally made it to Descanso Gardens. What a beautiful place. So many flowers to see. Be sure you stop and look, don't just glance. Lots of other things to do. They have crafts for the kids and there are other exhibits to look at. Hike up around the lake where you will see ducks and a goose. Roses, camellias, gardenias, lilacs - these are just a few of the flowers that you will see. Prices are reasonable and you can also become a member for a yearly fee and you can go as much as you like. Be sure to put Descanso Gardens on your bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islandgirl53
50,"Fragrances, beautiful blooms, a gift shop of unique items, and a GREAT little restaurant, too.","My husband and I LOVE to go to Descanso Gardens. We both are avid photographers and ALWAYS find something new to bring home 'on film' so to speak to look at over and over again.We became members this year so that we can go as often as we like, we are informed ahead of time of any special events, sales of plants, artwork in the gallery, etc..Descanso has something blooming nearly 365 days a year. The Garden is located in the very pretty town of La Canada Flintridge nestled at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains next to Pasadena.The parking lot itself has beautiful flowering trees, blooming flowers and the minute you walk past the check in gate you are surrounded by plants and fragrances.The outdoor restaurant has a most unique menu of sandwiches and other dishes, many of which are vegetarian, some vegan. That is important to me.The gift shop is fun to walk through. You will items from teas to jewelry to umbrellas to gift cards to toys to garden accessories to wind chimes to live plants are all awaiting you. In both the gift shop and restaurant, the membership gives you at least a 10% discount.When you start walking into the gardens, you have several choices in direction to go, depending on what you want to see. To see the entire gardens, it does take more than one trip.There is the Lilac garden area, the huge rose garden which has newer roses and the antique style, there are camellia bushes EVERYwhere throughout the gardens, so you always get to see a multitude of colors and types just from them. There are beautiful trees, archways, benches to sit upon to relax and just listen/enjoy or people watch. If you are a bit more adventurous there are natural habitats as well that you can hike through.The Japanese Tea House with a beautiful Japanese garden and bridge & a Koi pond, is a nice place to have a rest stop.Waterfalls, ponds, birds, butterflies, bees, squirrels, rabbits....all sorts of critters can be seen enjoying the gardens as well. For the little ones (the big ones can ride, too) there is a little train that takes a short trip winding around the garden, as well. Sometimes, you can watch a bride and groom posing for their pre-wedding photos or an actual wedding being performed on the grounds.Your visit will be relaxing, fragrant and fun. Enjoy !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712rebekac
50,"Wonderful place to go with kids, family","A great field trip for a weekend or to take friends from out of town; a camellia garden, Japanese garden, rose garden, tiny train for little ones, and a small café (nothing fancy). Gift shop full of things your grandmother would like. Perfect place to let small children go running wild. Love their Easter Egg hunt! But come early on a beautiful spring day, it does get busy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonymousDragon
50,Beautiful,"My friends and I spent the day here almost a year ago, and quite frankly, it was hard for us to leave. The beauty and tranquility of this place is amazing. There were many really cool hiding places with hidden benches to spend some time alone, reading, writing, or just reflecting. This is a great place for nature lovers, filled with beautiful trees, flowers, plants, ponds, etc. One thing I love about this place is that it is never crowded and very inexpensive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanyikasooalo
50,Large variety of intersting plants,The extensive grounds make for a beautiful place to walk and gaze at a large collection of camellias. The cafe is small but with interesting options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djstoll808
50,Beautiful,"We arrived around 3 PM so we knew we would not have a lot of time. We are so glad we decided to stop. The gardens are incredibly beautiful. We tried to see as much as we could in a short time, but if I lived here I could easily see spending the day enjoying the varied parts of the gardens. There are various events going on throughout the year. There was a wedding while we were there. I would love to go back if we visit there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandybeaches23
50,Very nice visit,"I have lived in California my whole life but had never been to the gardens. They where so beautiful ,uncrowded, and inexpensive. Try the cafe, I highly recommend the watermelon feta salad. Don't forget the self guided tour of the art gallery and the former resident's home. There is a Choo Choo train for the little ones to ride and don't forget to look closely at the lily pads,you just may be surprised!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaRussell_13
40,Beautiful gardens. Abundant flowers. Ample parking.,Arrived early a Saturday morning (15 minutes before opening) The line was short at that point. At opening time the line was enormous and it stayed that way most of the day. The gardens are clean and full of beautiful specimen plants and flowers. Many trees had beautiful blooms this time of year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOCGAC
50,A beautiful setting for any event or a hike,"We are fortunate to live close to the gardens. It is still a lovely place to go for a walk, a special event or to enjoy the various plants. We used to have tickets annually for the POPS Concerts in the Park. These were done by the Pasadena Pops. We bought a table and were able to entertain friends and clients there. I think the worst thing to happen was that Descanso Gardens decided not to continue that relationship, and it relocated to the Arboreteum, which is not as nice a setting and just not the same venue. If you become a member of the Garden, you can access the grounds for walks and hikes daily if you want though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingRealtor1

40,Very beautiful,"I nice place to spend the afternoon, if you are in the area.. I from Nebraska, but enjoy taking a,walk there with my grand kids. Last fall, around Halloween time, they did a very creative pumpkin carving display throughout the entire pard. It was very cool. I never dreamed people could carve pumpkins so well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthWicklow
50,Best Place to View Cherry Blossom in So Cal,"We have planned to visit the garden for years, finally I said enough waiting we are going. Somehow we chose the wrong weekend, the Sakura Festival weekend! When we arrived after 1.5-hour driving, we saw thousands of cars parked on the neighborhood street, and still thousands of them circling around hunting for parking space. We finally got into the parking lot, and we saw a shocking line of visitors: at least a mile long! We decided we'd come back the following week. We did, the traffic was much better, but still a lot of people due to the blossom season. However, it was worth the trouble to come twice in a row. The cherry trees were blossom at their best. The garden was huge and with crowds everywhere, but we were lucky to came upon a less trudged road and enjoyed most of our time in the park. There were other flowers in the garden as well. The most prominent is the tulips flowerbeds near the entrance, it is by far the biggest and most colorful tulips field I've ever seen. We left after the park was announced to be closed for the day. It was a day trip worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmbS_13
50,A Hidden Gem,I have been going here since I was a child and a visit there never fails to fill me with wonder. A place to go and spend quality time with your family in a beautiful and peaceful setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627

40,Definitely worth the trip,"We visited on Easter and it was jam packed! The line was quite long to get in and there were barely enough parking spaces but still worth the effort. I'd love to live nearby so I could visit throughout the year. The iris, roses and azaleas were gorgeous-a bargain at a$9 entry fee!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenK992
50,Beautiful flowers and grounds,"Visited with friends. As my first time, I was amazed how clean everything was and how organized the staff is. The garden is laid out in a way to make the visitors have a wonderful time. Make this a stop when visiting Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CdaOpa
50,Gem in a small town,"If you're looking to spend the day hanging out under the majestic oaks. Look no fiurther than this hidden gem. Located In the small town of la Canada, Descanso Gardens is , and always will be the small arboretum of the foothills. From summer concert series to Halloween jack o lantern lights. This is a fun place to spend a few hours. We routinely see deer while we are here and other wildlife too. The flowers are amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamsonBoss
50,Awesome date spot,If you or your significant other are an art or nature lover you really should check out the Descanso gardens. This place radiates serenity and is an awesome spot for a nice walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrJames4636
30,Nice walk,"It's a nice walk but I prefer Huntington Library which is about 8 miles away. I live 1 mile away from Descanso and I never go there. Huntington on the other hand, is much more interesting. In addition to the mansion, and world class, and famous, art galleries, and library, the gardens are extensive and varied. In addition, there is a Japanese and Chinese, each with tea houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinmfcc
50,Thank you thank you thank you Descanso,"This garden alone makes living in La Canada the joy that it is. We belong, and I go every month, ofter more often, and take as many friends with me as I can. Every season there are treasures to be found. Going to the garden nourishes me and teaches me. I often combine a walk around the garden with lunch at the cafe, sometimes visit the Gallery near the Boddy House, and always find something new. The garden is small enough to get to know it easily, but large enough to encompass a wide range of plants. And the changes in the garden, which are an ongoing part of the teaching program, are always a pleasure to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spanprof1951
30,Cherry Blossom festival - not worth the 2 hour wait,"One star for the cherry blossom festival which pretty much consisted of one guy playing the flute in a kimono and a bbq stand selling sandwiches in the main park. I didn't expect to see my childhood Japan or Taiwan where there are hundreds of these trees but I think there were less than 8 large trees in full bloom by the Japanese tea garden... This after a two hour wait in line just to buy tickets - that was a negative 1000 star rating. I couldn't believe it. You'd think they would have been better prepared for this. It seemed like it was the first year they've ever had cherry trees on display. It was a mad house. Soooooo many people - and no one obeying the rules. Just going wherever they feel like off the designated trails and walkways just to get a picture. I over heard one person remark that it seemed like people had never seen a tree or flowers before... LoL I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but when you hear the word ""festival"" 8 blossoming trees and a guy playing the flute definitely does not come to mind. The good news is that the tulips and the rest of the grounds made up for the underwhelming ""festival"". The tulips in particular were beautiful. So colorful and vibrant. The rest of the grounds were a more comfortable walk as they're were less people and the walkways well kept and clear but after such a long wait to get in and then super long lines for food/drinks and again super long lines for the ladies restrooms we were just too tired to fully enjoy the rest of the gardens. My advice is to not go on a ""festival"" weekend. You will only miss the guy playing the flute, the bbq stand and the long lines. It's a beautiful place to visit otherwise and that's why I give it three stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaveNikonWillTravel
50,Delightful Family Outing,"We celebrated my sister-in-law's birthday by visiting Descanso Gardens as a family. The camellia flowers were in bloom and the variety and colors were stunning. We've visited the gardens in April in the past and loved the cherry blossoms, forsythia and other spring flowers blooming at that time. Great place to practice photography skills! This outing was excellent for all members because the paths keep the group together and it was good workout for all, with a variety of steeper paths and flat paths. We even saw many families with wheelchairs and strollers. The weather was unusually hot and the gardens provided shade and a peaceful retreat, away from the traffic. The membership prices allowed my sister-in-law's family to get in free. My husband and I were from out-of-state, but, paid the senior rate of $6 each. What a deal! We were able to purchase nature-themed gifts from their well-stocked gift shop for our grandchildren.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanHana
40,Great for strolling; fun stuff for kids; more colorful in-season,"Colder months are not the best time to visit a garden, but I wanted to experience some good strolling when there weren’t hordes of people. Descanso Gardens is a very good place overall, but the best experience would be during warmer months—when things are blooming—provided one arrives early to avoid crowds.I found these places to be the most interesting:(1) the Oak Forest provides an interesting canopy over a green lawn, and the Ancient Forest is darker and more dense(2) The Japanese Garden features a tea house and numerous elevated walkways proximate to the pond(3) The Boddy House, which was the original mansion built on the property in the late 1930’s. You can tour this (no additional charge), and it’s a pretty cool place. Next to the house is the Stuart Hagga Gallery, which has contemporary art. Behind the house and museum is a path that one can take to get views of the grounds and the San Gabriel Mountains.Kids will want to check out the Enchanted Railroad and ride on the eighth-scale diesel cars; $3/rider (minimum 30” tall).If you go just to stroll and take pictures, budget around two hours to see everything. Add more time if you want to linger in the house/museum, spend time with the kids’ activities or have lunch.Notes:* If you are driving north on SR-2 from the I-5 freeway and points south, there are two exits with the name “Verdugo.” Take the 2nd one! The first one—Verdugo Road—is in Eagle Rock, and it’s not the area where you want to be. Verdugo Boulevard—the exit you want—is a stone’s throw south of the I-210, where the SR-2 freeway ends. Can you guess how I know this?* Parking is free, ample and proximate to the main entrance.* There is a nice café right near the entrance. I didn’t dine there, but it seemed to be very popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
50,Gorgeous Garden,"What a treat it was to recently visit this relaxing retreat tucked away in the middle of a busy urban area. For a relatively inexpensive admission, you can spend a morning or a day strolling shady pathways among oak and other trees. If you are fortunate enough as we were you may also see the thousands of colorful camellias in bloom to add to the beauty of the garden. There is also an extensive rose garden although it was a little early in the season for the bushes to be in bloom yet. There is also a small art gallery to visit as well as an historical home. Several water features, i.e. ponds, a lake and streams can be discovered throughout the gardens. A lovely patio is available to enjoy lunch from the cafe on the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catdmccoy
40,Peaceful & Lovely Environment,"Today, many of the camellia trees and bushes were in bloom! There were so many colors and varieties to see. This was the highlight. There is a large pond with many mallard ducks and some geese. The rise garden was not in bloom this time of year. It is a peaceful and pretty place to stroll. Entrance is $9 for most. There are discounts for seniors and children. Restaurant and small gift shop on premises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142

50,Love this place,"Great place to walk, sit, go see art, learn new skills, hear music in the summer, paint plein aire, study plants and just relax. Gift shop is terrific too. Lots of interesting and unusual plant species and gift items too. Love Descanso. Have an annual membership.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickyr549
50,Excellent Escape into Nature,"Descanso Gardens isn't as wonderful as Huntington Library, but it is a gem with plenty of gorgeous walks and easy parking. Huntington can get packed and is more expensive. Descanso is more of a retreat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223JaniceP223
50,A Sunday afternoon stroll through the gardens,This is a beautiful place though can be somewhat loud with children who seem to just be excited about the prospect of riding the miniature train or observing nature.

50,"""RISE"" ROSE TO THE OCCASION AT DESCANSO GARDENS","I had never heard of ""Rise Of The Pumpkins"" until my friend suggested we go. I'm game for anything, but was unprepared for the size and impact of this pumpkin event, which is unlike any other. These aren't merely jack o'lanterns, folks. These are beautifully carved pumpkin SCULPTURES, many of them life-sized figures, cars, dragons...you name it, they created it, entirely from pumpkins in various configurations. It's an easy walk through what is normally the rose garden; there were several people in wheelchairs, being pushed with little or no trouble. Children and adults alike were awed by the displays. I understand this is an annual event and we intend to go again, and bring a bunch of friends with us next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrisW536

40,Rise of the Pumpkins at Descanso Gardens 2015 . . . disappointing in comparison to previous years,"I want to echo the previous posters sentiment in regards to Rise of the Pumpkins 2015. Previous years there were numerous individually carved pumpkins. This year they opted for exponentially fewer individually carved pumpkins opting for larger installations. the time to view things took less than 15 minutes. Hardly worth the money. The folks from Descanso Gardens were apologetic and encouraged dissatisfied customer to reach out to the Rise folks, which I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktS5189DV
50,A very lovely park to walk around in,"There are so many different things to see in the wildlife reserve- plants, ducks, beautiful landscaping... I can't get enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dieselthis
30,"The Rise of the Jack o'Lanterns, Descanso Gardens 2015","Last year (2014) the Descanso Gardens event was SO much better than this year. Looks like now that they've added another location they are spreading themselves thin. The most detailed pumpkins are, of course, the fake ones (yes, it's true----read their FAQ) and they are still wonderful to look at. The real pumpkins that are replaced every week are far more numerous and look like grade-school efforts. Unfortunately, there are many expanses that are empty except these bad carvings (and a few nicer fake ones being re-used from last year). Some of the pop culture references are just corny, and some is just plain dull, like the unlit pumpkin flamingos. And some is just badly done, like Cinderella's coach. But they had some cool stuff too, like the expanse of jellyfish and Chinese dragon. One of our favorites last year was the pumpkin heads enclosed in tanks filled with water, but the water seemed murky this year and the faces not as humorous. All 4 of us agreed we would not return. Note to people who run this: try harder next time!!!However, first-timers will still enjoy it, especially if they have kids. So we still recommend it for one visit. We went Saturday @ 7:30 PM (prime time) and did not find the crowds that bad. They added too-bright white lights around (I guess people found it too dark last year) and the loud soundtrack was irritatingly repetitive. But the staff is still very friendly and it's all well-managed. We were told the Santa Anita location has a different selection of pumpkins (for example, the well-advertised tribute to ""Modern Family"" is there) and it's a bigger event too. Maybe we'll try that location next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugLongBeach
50,A wonderful place to find peace in the city,A great place to wander and have a cup of tea. If you love to look a beautiful plants and landscape this a great place to visit. I use to love to walk on the paths and be at peace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReginaM301
50,Beautiful...except when something's happening at Rose Bowl,"Ok this is a beautiful piece of land and I much prefer this than Huntington Gardens, not that H Gardens isn't beautiful, but it's just stuffier there and the management is more uptight (no picnics, lots of dumb rules etc).But...you cannot go to Descanso Gardens when ANYTHING is happening at the Rose Bowl. It is an absolute nightmare of traffic around Pasadena. Don't even consider going anywhere that side of Pasadena when some event (flea market, soccer game, UCLA game, etc) is going on. You will get nowhere.Honestly this is also a critique of the poor city planning on the part of Pasadena. Just sub par really. To me after having lived all over the US in various cities, Pasadena lacks in so many ways. Of course I write this after having tried to get my family to Descanso Gardens this past Saturday and Sunday only to run into parking lot style traffic. Both days I had to reverse up on ramps illegally with my flashers on in order to avoid sitting in some line of traffic waiting for what I have no idea.This is a rant yes. And If it has any effect on motivating the city of Pasadena to consider other things that happen around the area, I hope this sends a message to the right people that life doesn't surround whatever happens at the Rose Bowl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEWK
50,A jewel in the Southern California hills!,"Discanso Gardens is a great place to visit, sight see, relax and take in nature's beauty.

50,Worth the Visit: Peaceful & Relaxing,"We visited last Thursday, we decided we needed to walk more often and as the grounds are shadier than any place else in the area, we chose the gardens.Lovely, is all I can say....... There are trails if you prefer to walk among the trees & plants rather than on the driveways and benches all along the way, so one can sit & rest or just view the sights.There are birds, butterflies, bees, lizards, spiders, & wildlife at various times of the day.We liked it so much we purchased a membership & when we did that, they took our admission fees off of the membership!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntie-Nanuuq
30,Came for the Boddy House; not so great (the gardens are fine),"The house is largely a write off - it was a symphony house at some point and has been modernized to the point that only the structure remains (and it is hidden). Save for the library - that you can make a history lesson about Manchester Boddy. Plus the house docent has plenty of time to chat :) My visit was September so the Roses were closed, but it is a pleasant park-like setting to walk through with interesting specimen plants, and the café is well situated and good place to stop for a bite before you move on to the next destination. Apparently a popular spot for mothers with toddlers: good on them, bad for you (diaper discussions carry surprisingly well in a quiet glen - as do tired children's complaints).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW

The new woodland area provides many sights and sounds of nature with birds, ducks, and turtles wading in the pond. I've witnessed deer sightings many times while wandering along the paths. The café has soup, salads, sandwiches, and drinks...even hot dogs for kids. Don't miss stopping by the gift shop on your way out. There are so many treasures and trinkets for sale, including books, plants, jewelry, and a toy section for children. A nice collection of succulents are for sale as well. If you bring children, be sure to visit the children's garden with a small maze, and buy a ticket to ride the enchanted forest train.

40,Beautiful year-round,"Lovely gardens - check the website for seasonal blooming schedule & events, and call ahead if you have your heart set on seeing something specific (ie: tulips, art gallery). The weekend walking tour (once a day - wish it was offered more often perhaps with different themes/lengths) is a nice way to learn the history of the property. Talk may vary by guide and what's in bloom - our guide focused on history and trees. It took about 1.5 hours and covered the outer paths ending at the Boddy house. I took the tour, had lunch and wandered on my own and it was a good 4 hour visit. Summer is not very 'bloomy' but still a lovely place - with many benches to take a break and relax. I am surprised that they do not have docents located around the gardens to answer questions - the 'guide brochure' is very basic. Lunch at the cafe was 'okay'. Wonderful gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OH2CA

This seems to be a tucked away treasure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661dees
50,Worth a trip,"Definitely a place to check out, it's a beautiful garden with cheap admission. The rose arch is nice you can smell the roses. Lots of walking. Big trees, beautiful Camilla in many colors. The mansion is a must see. What a beautiful kitchen! So many things to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugaylange
40,Beautiful grounds - A wonderful place to enjoy nature,"My mom and I visited Descanso gardens for several hours this past week. It was quiet and so peaceful. If you can appreciate flowers and nature, you will like this place. We saw dragonflies land on lily pads and hummingbirds frolic(do hummingbirds actually do this??) in the Japanese Gardens. It wasn't huge or exciting, but the roses were amazing in full bloom and we loved the small waterfalls and babbling brooks. This is a great place to take someone special that you just want to stroll hand in hand with.There is a cafe that has drinks and a nice and pretty sitting area if you want to have lunch as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chanybean
50,A wonderful place to visit!,I've been here during the fall and in the summer and can't wait to check it out during the Spring next year. It is a lovely place to meander.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I6955TPmichellep
30,Better in February and early May,"Visited here on Memorial day weekend but, most of the blooms in the rose garden had faded and weren't that many flowers in bloom overall except for one small part of the gardens. Better to come in February for the spectacular camellia blooms or in early May when the roses start blooming and the wildflowers are still showing off.For the kids, they will like the little train that winds through the gardens.Admission is only $8. For my money, I rather go to the Huntington Gardens this time of the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcman63
30,fair experience,"This place is off the beaten path, it was once the estate of a publishing magnate who unsuccessfully ran for California Senator. The grounds are spread out. Some plants arelabeled and others not. Not much was in bloom here so the roses were disappointing. I also found some of the plantings to be sparsely spaced and not what I was expecting from a rose garden. We had a docent tour which lasted almost 2 hours and was slow going. Not one of the best gardens to see in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfd
40,Peaceful and Beautiful Gardens and Walking Paths,"We spent the most of our visit in the Rose garden area. It was so pretty to see the different colors of roses and other flowers from all over the world. It was like we had escaped to a peaceful flower world; with all our worries and stresses behind us. There were lots of benches and sitting areas throughout the facility to appreciate the beautiful flowers. Being here made my mind clear and calm. Such a Zen feeling and I felt beautiful surrounded by those flowers. The Japanese garden area was another favorite. When we entered into the Japanese garden, we felt like we had stepped into another dimension, filled with serenity and tranquility The bridge, the house, the path, the sculptures...you will forget where you are . The lake area was just okay. The Boddy House, home of the original residents and creators of the gardens , is worth the visit. A beautiful estate home . The lilac garden area was not blooming because it's not the right month. But it was still fun walk around the garden. The Lily Pond with lots of Lily leaves instantly made us feel so refreshed. We saw many turtles, and many big Koi fish there. The outdoor little amphitheater was a good spot to stop and relax. The admission is cheap , $9.00, and you can spend the whole day there to explore each flower and tree if you would like to. It's also a great and easy hike. Fun visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandC0218
50,Lovely!,"If you want to get away from the madness for a few hours without driving out of your way, spend some time here. Descanso Gardens is an oasis in the concrete jungle that soothes and lifts the spirit.The eats here are not bad here either. Patina, baby!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aleidatm
50,Zen moments,Descanso gardens is a beautiful place to walk and enjoy the plants and flowers. They are always changing the flower beds so there is always something new to see. During the week it is very peaceful and a nice place to walk with a friend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/138AndreaB
50,A Gem in the Foothills,"Descanso Gardens is a absolute gem for the visitor. It is serene, and has an abundance of trees and plants to delight all ages. Descanso has a very professional and friendly staff to answer all questions. The visit is well worth the small entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnwO5346IM
50,"Flora, Fauna, & Fun","Once a month Descanso Gardens provides a free day that allows everyone, including non-members, an opportunity to come in and walk the grounds. This was how I was introduced to the interior of this primarily botanical reserve. The place is very peaceful for strolling and contemplation, but the keepers have everything timed so that whenever you visit, something different is just coming into bloom. When it's tulip season, they're everywhere in all varieties. When it's time for roses, they come out in abundance. There are seasonal activities, entertainment, history, a tiny train that takes passengers of all ages, and you will see turtles, and frogs, and myriad birds. It's hard to believe this little gem of nature sits in the middle of an ordinary neighborhood. Membership is fairly inexpensive, but as I say, you can check it out on Free Tuesdays, which are the third Tuesday of each month. You can always go just for lunch at the cafe (which is excellent) and you don't have to be a member for that, or to visit the bookstore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RevLovebrew
30,It is amazing place...but!,"I always have enjoyed coming to Descanso Gardens, I have to say that yesterday it was the first time with a baby and unfortunately they don´t have a place where to change diapers besides the really dirty (water liking) stinky bathrooms by the restaurant, really disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgmpg

40,"Lots of native plants, less of the manicure fancy gardens","This garden was wonderfully done. It had many many native gardens and natural forest areas. There was a Japanese garden and a little formal area when we first arrived but it really focused on the natives.The lilac garden section was amazing. I went at the beginning of March so it was not in full bloom but I highly recommend this if you love gardens and flowers.The gift shop was spectacular. lots of books, knick knacks, garden decor, some plants, etc. It was really full!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikirol
40,"Expected a little more, but still nice","We went on a last minute whim, but had a little trouble getting to the front door. After finally finding it, we walked through much of the property in about 1-1/2 hours. Probably the time of year did not suit the gardens, because much of it was just starting to bloom. I would suggest waiting and going later in spring time. Their is a entrance fee, but parking is free. Any time of day is good to go, but wear your walking shoes...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt
50,Descanso Gardens,"Beautiful place to visit, the grounds are larger than it appears on the map, the paths are paved good for those who go with a wheelchair and also dirt paths for those who want a closer view. In the home on the grounds is short video giving you history of the beautiful garden. The cost is very reasonable and well worth it. Encourage you to take a hat and comfortable shoes, it took us about 4 hours to walk most the grounds. There is a small cafe, the sandwich we had was delicious and plentiful we could of split the sandwich. There is also a gift shop on the grounds. Truly worth visiting. Would love to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessMadera
40,Delightful escape in the city,"We visited here just before their annual Cherry Blossom Festival. The flowers were outstanding - not only the cherry trees, but tulips and camellias. They have a pleasant outdoor café and a peaceful Japanese Garden. The Boddy House is frequently open to the public - an interesting home. There is even a train ride for children. We enjoy going during the week - the place is almost empty and you can really enjoy a pleasant stroll. Parking is free and the cost is reasonable, although they do not allow free reciprocal admissions if your member garden is within 90 miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraF388
20,Overrated and crowded,"Honestly the entrance looks nice, but what comes then is a bad joke like the "" Japanese Garden"" . I have been to other Japanese Gardens, this one is VERY dissapointing!I would have paid even more if they would offer something authentic, and different, but the whole time we all had the feeling that we have paid just to enter in a NORMAL park.If you love roses, you will probably prefer the rose garden in front of the National History Museum L.A., which is for free.To really top it, the "" enchanted train"" , which you have to pay apart, is not worth the 40 minutes wait we had ( reminded me of Disneyland) Not at all. It is like for 15 people and there is a HUGE line.There was also a long line at the entrance, and an employee was asking everyone if they want a membership to avoid the line.Membership for a park, no thank you! And you certainly can't rest ""descansar "" here , far too many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunny2312
40,Nice Gardens,"During our recent stay in Pasadena, we wanted to find a pretty morning walk every day - particularly since most museums don't open till later. Descanso did not disappoint. You can easily wander the grounds and enjoy different vignettes. It truly is a ""camelia farm"" (was actually a commercial entity at one time) and the blooms in February were outstanding. The house is a bit of a disappointment (plus the library was closed for redecorating) but is worth a quick visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcyork
40,Great place to visit when the camellias are in bloom in February,"I have been to Descanso throughout the year, but it is clearly in the winter months when the camellias are showing off in their glory. This garden has the full spectrum of colors and varieties. If you also want to have a quiet spot off the beaten path from the LA freeways to enjoy mother nature, this is a fine retreat.Lots of winding paths, water features, japanese garden, art gallery display and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chicago90Phoenix
50,Pleasant day in the gardens,"We spent several hours at Descanso Gardens looking at the flowers, trees, ponds and other attractions. Lots of birds, butterflies, turtles and fish in the pond. Reasonable admission. Great photography opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck8700
50,Amazing Gardens,"This is the perfect spot to stroll through gardens, you can enjoy camellias, roses, oaks and step back in time in LA. The staff at the gardens do a great job of maintaining the huge property and always have new attractions. We attended the Halloween Pumpkin Festival and it was amazing. If you have kids they run a ""ride on"" train on weekends that my kids have always loved riding. It takes them on a 5 to 7 minute ride along the streams, past the ponds and through the camellias. If you live near here it is a great walking area and you can buy an annual pass which helps keep the park open and running. Once you are inside you feel like you are in another world, while just beyond the gates is the real world. Depending on the time of the year there are ducks, swans and all kinds of birds on their small lake. Go, see, explore and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randys101
40,Like botanical gardens? Like Camellias?,"This place is very beautiful and tucked away in the hills away from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. Don't worry, it's very easy to get to.-What really stands out is their world class collection of camellias. They literally have a forest of them. Also you have a quaint Japanese tea garden with koi ponds and the like. They have concessions in the front with a nice seating area and the gift shop has some quality items. Honestly, I would recommend this over the L.A. Arboretum as it is more dense in trees and truly is magical. There's a bird observation platform overlooking a pond and opposite that is a lovely rose garden.-Although it is large facility, it is not as big as The Huntington Library or the L.A. Arboretum. This makes navigating the entire place very manageable to most fitness levels and age groups. This in turn leaves one very satisfied and not overly pressured into ""hiking"" for hours or make one feel like they ""missed"" anything. It is all very accessible and doable.-The reason why only 4 stars is it can get very crowded...and that really can spoil the tranquility of the place. They have a sit-on train...a tiny little train...that you can buy tickets for to tour the park (more for kids) and their docent lead tours are very informative. So much to see and do.-My advice to those that want the most out of this experience, go during the week and be there right when they open. You'll for the most part have the place to your selves with the odd member or two strolling around. If you are really particular, call them and ask what their landscaping schedule is as you don't want chainsaws and leaf blowers blaring the whole time.-If you visit, I hope you have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyP563
50,Descanso Gardens are the best thing in La Canada.,"A perfect place to enjoy the gardens, camellias, roses and a lovely art gallery. The paths are easy to follow and the birdwatching is excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dottiej42
30,Not a bad garden for the location,"After dropping off our daughter early at the airport, my wife suggested we take advantage of our early departure to visit descanso gardens. As we had visited before, I was less than enthusiastic. While I like camellias (I have seven different varieties in my garden) this garden doesn't really display them in an interesting or insightful way. Some of their later improvements are nice enough, but with so many better gardens to visit it is really hard to recommend them. Add to this their relatively high admission price and out of the way location, and I would have to recommend many other gardens first. You can do better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealRoadWarrior
40,--- Nice Getaway From Tourism; Relaxing,"Our trip to Descanso in January was clearly not what it would have been later in the year. Some camellias were blooming and the gardens were certainly lush enough for a nice walk around.If you've been dealing with freeways and buildings, take the drive and get away!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Godenar
40,Descanso Delight,"Our children grew up visiting the gardens with us, and now, with 4 grandkids ages 10-2, we are still enjoying Desanso. The environment has evolved, is and still evolving, over the years. Fortunately,the Enchanted Railroad still does a little spin around the main walk. We do miss the little red ticket cottage, but are grateful that the tiny train remains. Also, the serene wildlife lake with its turtles,fish and ducks is such a delight to the younger kids. The added waterfall is a welcome, cool retreat during our all-too-often heat waves. Would love to see the return of tea and snacks at in the Japanese Garden, an environment that really sustains lingering if it just offered that cherry blossom punch, tea and tiny treats of years gone by. Summer time does bring some evening life to the Japanese Garden as all of Descanso opens for light-hearted concerts. Boddy House art exhibits are not as rich as I would like, but there an attempt. Rose Garden is a seasonal treat, a bit too warm in summer and barren in winter of course, but spring and fall are a delight. Do go to see the Cherry Blossoms, to smell the lilacs, treasure the old camellias and grand oaks.It is not the floriferous entrance of yore, but the space does welcome and the patio cafe usually delivers tasty soup and sandwiches. Would like to see a refreshing of stock in the gift shop. I think most of the merchandise order must not have changed in many years. As we have just returned from the garden capital of the world, The Cotwolds,where we so enjoyed the gift shops as well as excellent luncheon and tea meals. California has the environment to be outdoors, but does not offer the amenities of so many European gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mimipjs

50,Lovely even in December,Our family was visiting LA for the holidays and enjoyed the beauty of the gardens inspire of the fact it is off season. Some of the Camelias and roses were still in bloom.

50,Faces in the garden,"Perhaps faces in the garden is too strong, yet if you take the time to pause, some of the old oaks actually do seem to have faces in the gnarled knots where large limbs once grew. Puckered and perhaps grumpy old men, these oaks and redwoods shelter the deer which can often be seen at the gardens in early morning or late afternoon. Quiet and patience is rewarded by seeing a buck with antlers on display as well as does calmly eating as patrons (quietly and softly) walk by. And then there are flowers, and ducks, and fish begging to be fed--a no no. A place of calmness and beauty before returning to the bustle and noise of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scuba2214
50,FOOD WITH A VIEW,"Right in the middle of the most beautiful gardens, this restaurant provides a wonderful repast while walking the gardens or just sitting and feeling the wonderment of nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
40,Brief visit to view new garden,"The fall weather was spectacular this one day and we enjoyed the fresh air and lovely grounds. Mothers with toddlers were showing their kids the flowers and all was pleasantly quiet and invigorating. Liked the new garden area and look forward to its ""natural"" development.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaL936
50,An oasis in the city,"For years I saw the announcements for special events and informational lectures at DG. And for years, I said I would go. I finally went last week, and now I wonder why it took me so long to get there.We went on an unseasonably warm November day, and we're surprised by how much the temperature drops just a short distance from the entrance. The blacktop parking lot was at least 20 degrees warmer. We went to see the Taiko Drum group and an Ikebana (floral arrangement) display, so the Japanese Garden was teaming with people and activity. The rest of the grounds were less populated and we meandered through without a map (I forgot to pick one up), managing with well-placed signage.Descano Gardens is such a departure from what most of us see everyday. It's not exactly a forest, and it's certainly not ""natural woodlands"" since part of the property was originally planted as a camellia or floral farm. However, the canopy and greenery can make you feel that nature is not so far away from our little asphalt jungle. If you live close enough, I would suggest the annual pass (we got a family pass for $80/yr), that includes free admission to other gardens. (It's not a membership to the other venues; just admission.) I know we have Griffith Park and the Angeles National Forest right around the corner for free, but proximity and ease of access with ample free parking make this a no-brainer for a quick escape back to nature.Try to make the trek to the top of the hill to see Boddy House. It's fully furnished with period pieces, with a small adjacent art gallery and botanical specimens showing vertical landscaping. Inside the home is filled with historical articles and info. Just imagine what it would have been like to live there surrounded by nature! The entire property is 160 acres and we barely covered the area from the Visitors Center to the Boddy House in 2-3 hours. That's another reason the annual pass is such a great deal! We have a lot more exploring to do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USC_Mare
50,Culture and beauty,"I have a membership to Descano Gardens so I can take walks and enjoy the flowers. This weekend I went and was surprised to enjoy a drumming presentation.

30,Great garden!,"Best times to go is during March, April and May for the floral gardens.In the summer time, only roses are blooming. So the Rose Garden is a must. Everywhere else feels more like a forest than a garden. Ample signs around the garden and a map so you won't get lost since it's actually bigger than I expected. Multiple trails to take. I took the one to Boddy's House. With its sophisticated interior, you can learn about the history of Descanso Gardens.The Japanese garden was very mediocre. I thought long beach and huntington are much more beautiful. Cherry blossoms are not in season now. The garden in general was rather unkempt, and the amount of spiderwebs all over the seats signifies a lack of human activity and upkeep.My favourite part of Descanso Garden was definitely the Rose Garden. Lots of pretty roses, arches and gazebos. Little benches that provide a light shade. The tram is also a free 1 hour attraction.I also took the train. Kids ride for free. A little pricey for a 10 minute ride around the garden, but a very nice experience especially towards the end where you go through a mini tunnel.Unfortunately, the lilac garden is only in bloom in spring. The gift store was very nice though, with plenty of cute gardening accessories. There are various water fountains around the garden too.***Tip: Use your student card!. take the train with the money saved. have a picnicFavourites: more easily navigable than other gardens i've been to. Rose garden!!!Do not want: lack of blooms in late springLast words: Come again during spring, it's pretty cheap anyways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faerie87

50,Halloween event : The Rise of the Jack o' lanterns was a hit,"fun, fun, 5,000 carved pumpkins presented in different tableaus ( sports figures, recently celebrity departed, popular and iconic TV and movie figures, dinosaurs, Wizard of Oz, haunted tre, Day of the Dead) were intricately carved works of art. The Kardashian images were the scarieat of all. This after dark event winds through the gardens with the wll lit pumpkins set back behind a roped off area. Takes about 1 1/2 hours to leisurely stroll...paths are pretty smooth, but dark. Plenty of guides with muted flashlights. There are drink stands and snacks, including wine and a beer garden offering, a garden gift shop and Halloween themed items for purchase. Very unique and impressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013
50,The Rise Of The Jack O’ Lanterns,"I visited Descanso for The Rise. If you like Jack-O-Lanterns, you'll have a blast. It's thousands of well carved pumpkins. Great Halloween event. I think the pumpkins are a little too far from the audience, but I understand you can't have kids reaching out and knocking them over. Also, it was way too crowded. I wish they raised the price and sold less tickets per hour. The only area that wasn't crowded was the Kardashian pumpkins, no one seemed to care about those. Many of the pumpkins were real, many were foam pumpkins from funkins.com, none of them were the cheap plastic pumpkins you can get at the craft store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccamp89

The meals are really special and you get to meet all kinds of wonderful people too...the wine isn't bad either, actually it's great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chillynv
30,Meh,"Rise of the Jack-o-lanterns is a special Halloween event at Descanso Gardens involving lit-up pumpkins carved into celebrity faces and scenes from movies and games, or assembled into larger displays like dinosaurs. You walk along the trails looking at them. It looked super cool on the website and I was excited to go, but we (my eight-year-old son and I) ended up being kind of bored. It was way too crowded, and after you get over the novelty of fine art-level artistry on a pumpkin, you start to wonder...why? Just because you can carve Kim Kardashian on a pumpkin doesn't mean you should. There was one carver working when we were there but he was wearing headphones and had his back to us, so he definitely wasn't into interacting with us or answering questions. I wouldn't go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15leslies
50,"Very nice gardens, wished we lived closer","Even though we live ""close"" to Descanso, I went there for the first time last Sunday, after living in LA for 20 plus years. There was plenty of parking. We arrived at 10 and there were people there and they were enjoying the garden. It was 70 degrees when we arrived and 98 when we left three hours later (yes, in Oct). So GO EARLY if you hate heat like me. This garden was VERY shady which was VERY awesome because I don't like the heat or sunburn you get with full sun. There were a LOT of benches, and I mean a LOT. They were in shady areas and any time I wanted one, there was one, and even MORE often. How great is that. There was not a lot in bloom. We went to the house area and stopped to see the art and that was in the adjacent building. Both were very nice. The Japanese and California gardens were nice. The Rose garden was closed for the Halloween event and I was disappointed because it looked like they were still in bloom. We stopped at the Mt. Sac plant festival going on that weekend and bought a beautiful plant which we planted today. There were also beautiful plants and items in the gift shop. Some things seemed high priced but some items were very reasonable and there were a lot of nice items. The restrooms are at the front and they were clean. People at the garden were friendly, both staff and other patrons. Would recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
40,"""Rise of the Jack O'Lanterns"" held here in October","Came here for the special showing of ""Rise of the Jack O'Lanterns"" which is only in October. This was my first time here for this event and it was pretty cool! You have to buy the tickets weeks in advance because they sell out fairly quick and you are given a time slot (ie: 9:45pm) of which can arrive later but not earlier. Parking is plentiful and free. Hand carved pumpkins by the 100's as you walk along the trails of Descanso Gardens. My tickets were $28pp and I'd say it was worth it and I'll probably come next year too. The pumpkins are beautifully carved (some with hand paintings as well as carvings) and beautifully displayed along the trails. The did have the usual overpriced food/Beer vendors at the event so I would recommend eating out somewhere at the many restaurants nearby. It takes approximately 45min-1 1/2 hrs to walk through the entire event. It was not overcrowded which was nice. I will post pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la123brat
40,A serene and gorgeous garden park with easy walking trails and 'featured' sections by season,"Renew yourself at Descanso Gardens. Breeze through the beautiful gardens and sections. Highlights are the Japanese gardens, the camelias, astonishing shade plants, enormous live oaks with lots of character and drama, and interesting light filtering through the foliage in magical ways. The park is inexpensive; free parking close by; not crowded on a Sept. weekday afternoon. It is a moment of rushing pleasure given to us by nature. One area has native plants and one section is all about the roses - prolific, but in California desert, you do get the 'dry' version of plants that I've known in the subtropics and tropics. It's cool to see their version too! Benches, bathrooms (few and far between) are comfort features available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsihrofhhisc
40,Peaceful place,"Love the serenity of this place. You can get lost just walking around the garden. The whole family can spend a day here, with kids not being bored. We had fun riding the train. Decided to take the tour of the whole garden and opted only for a map which is being provided. Entrance fee is cheap, but membership would be recommended if multiple visit is planned in the future.

50,This is a great place to take a walk.......,The collection of California Native plants amid California Coastal Oaks was first-rate. We spent the better part of 4 hours wandering around the 160 acres and enjoying the gardens. This is a great place to take a walk If you like to get away from the city and be surrounded by nature. It is truly peaceful and restful as it's name implies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeff3629
50,A great place to meet a friend for lunch!,"Just want to give a shout-out to the employees and volunteers who work at Descanso Gardens! Thank you for being so pleasant and helpful! I met a good friend there recently for an early lunch, a brisk walk, and some fun shopping for little stocking stuffers (never too early!) at the gift store. We didn't have much time that day but we made the most of our 2 hours! The day was warm but seemed quite cool as we walked through the beautiful camelia gardens. If you are new to Los Angeles, this is a great place to visit! If you have lived in Los Angeles all your life (like us!), revisit this place! It's as beautiful and colorful as I remembered as a kid. What a great way to spend some time with a friend on a summer day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4everBuds
50,A lovely place for everyone to enjoy. . .,"Descanso Gardens is renown for its extensive collection of camellias which grown under enormous canopies of natural oak forests amid other shade-loving plants. It also features a rosarium where spring and summer bring eye-popping color from all varieties of roses and well-suited companion plants and a Japanese garden of graceful maples, azaleas, and spring-flowering cherry trees. California native specimens thrive in this sprawling wild environment providing food and shelter for a wide selection of birds and wildlife. There is much local history and lovely interior design in the Boddy House, and contemporary art on display in the Stuart Haaga gallery everyday from 10-4 except Mon. I highly recommend this for a leisurely stroll, a hearty exercise walk in beautiful environs, and a place to enjoy horticultural exhibits and photography. A casual patio café, beautiful gift shop, and seasonal concerts/ events for the whole family add to the variety of things to do. This is a true gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cattylea
40,Consider buying a membership for early entry,"Gardens are lovely, but we New Englanders are not used to the fierce sun; most visitors wore big sunhats and plenty of sunblock and long sleeves; you should do the same. I guess if you are a member you can arrive at 8 am and tour the gardens in the cool of the morning which might be worth it as it does get crowded as well and its a wonderful cause. It seemed very dry when we were there but that is just California in the summertime I guess. We have never seen the Camellia Forest in bloom in the early spring, but that is on our bucket list. Save time to visit the home and the art gallery as they are quite worth it, but it may cause you to dream of being a millionaire California publishing baron. Not sure if you should bring young children here, the toddlers we saw here seemed to hate it and were protesting loudly. Caution in the gift shop, as you are going want to buy everything you see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leafpeeper98
40,Tulips to brighten one's day,"Having lived in Europe and now in LA, I have missed these flowers. What a lovely surprise to see these in a place where one can enjoy a relaxing walk away from the hustle of the city. I enjoyed the walk and seeing camelias in bloom too. The blue wisteria in the front is a sight for lovers of flower bearing climbers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari07
50,"This is a ""Can't Miss"" Attraction!",My friend and I walk about 4-5 times a week at Descanso Gardens so we can get our work-out and watch the flowers grow:)The tulips and lilacs in spring and roses in summer are always a welcome sight. Any time of year can bring a smile to your face as there are so many little areas to enjoy from the waterfalls to the areas for children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroleD213
40,Escape from the city,"HIdden away in La Canada/Flintridge is a oasis from the city with a beautiful set of gardens. Wandering through the property took me back to my formative years in Pennsylvania when the ""woods"" were right out my back door. A relaxing spot that doesn't feel commercial or overcrowded (though I am sure that at certain times of the year, the gardens become more crowded...e.g. when the roses bloom)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jarettms
50,Warm memories,"What a delight!!! Around every corner there are native plants and flowers filling every sensation. I spent much of my childhood at Descanso Gardens (the 1960's) watching the development of the planning. Now, in my 60's, there are very warm memories and tons of botanical information. Do not miss this beauty.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robg306
50,Lovely Botanical Garden in La Canada/Flintridge,"Just 20 minutes from downtown L.A. (with no traffic, that is!), is a beautiful 160 acre botanical garden called Descanso Gardens (""descanso"" is Spanish for ""rest"" and it is certainly restful here). If you want instant serenity, this is the place to come. There is a Rose Garden, Japanese Garden, Camillia collection, Lilac Garden, California Natives Garden & Oak tree forest area. The Boddy House is a 22-room mansion open on weekends, that sits on a spectacular vantage point overlooking the San Gabriel mountains. An art gallery is also on the property. Weddings can be held here and currently they offer morning yoga classes and Tai Chi. There is a gift shop and cafe available. For the younger set, a little railroad travels around the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847georgeb
50,Descanso Gardens - Instant Serenity,"I took my family there on a Sunday outing. My granddaughter loved the train ride. The grounds are well-kept, natural and beautiful to behold. The place just emanates peacefulness. My favorite flower is the Lilac and Descanso has a lilac grove, in addition to many other seasonal flowers, including the cherry blossoms at this time of year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rev_Bev99
40,A garden worth browsing,I was with a group but found it nice to be able to stroll through the garden(s) by myself. Very good camelia collection and enough with name tags if you want to plant your own.Nice tour of the ranch house of the family that originally owned that plot of land now owned by the LA Recreation Department I think it is. However it's run separately and financed separately.Worth a visit and perhaps take a lunch to eat in the patio under an umbrella.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelerzz2
50,Decompression Time!,"It's been a while since I visited Descanso Gardens, so yesterday I took some ""me"" time and wandered around a portion of the gardens taking in all its beauty. I particularly liked the Japanese Garden, but there is so much more to see. Plan on spending at least a few hours there, but you'll probably need a return visit to see it all. I finally gave in and became a member. It's one truly one of Southern California's real treasures. Parking is free. Adults are still $9 and seniors are still $6. Children 5 - 12 are $4 each. Kids 5 and under are free. On my visit, the Café was closed but the Snack Shop was open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Tree lovers,This garden is a lovely place for any tree lover or camellia lover. I loved walking amongst the old trees some are over 400 years old. The roses date back to the late 1940's. The camellia plants are also old but mass produce flowers. I drove from Long Beach and be sure to know Verdungo and you want to take the second one. The gift shop is small but has a nice reasonably priced items. I also ate at the cafe where portions are very generous and reasonably priced. I really encourage you to go if you want a unique experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101NDTraveler2013
40,Great outdoor gardens (venue for private parties),"QUICK FACTS:Admission Required (Prices as of Dec 2013):=========================General $9Seniors (65+) $6Students (with ID) $6Children (5-12) $4Children (4 and under) FREEIf you are a member, ($70 annually for 2 people) then admission is free (you also receive free admission to other gardens including the Arboretum in Arcadia)Descanoso Gardens sits on 150 acres.Originally the property belonged to E. Manchester Boddy who owned the Los Angeles Daily News. If you visit the Boddy House (22-room, 12,000 sq ft house, renovated in 2007) which is on site, you'll see photos of him. The property now belongs to Los Angeles County.Other than visiting the gardens, they also are an event venue. You can host meetings, private events, weddings here.**Yelp Check-In Offer** = 20% off Lunch for 2 in the CafeMy department had its Year End Luncheon here this year in the Van De Kamp hall which can hold 180 people. (rental fee can run you between $600-$1,900).On site catering is provided by Patina Catering.We had a buffet of Ceasar Salad, Grilled Chicken Breast, Seared Tilapia, Wheat Pasta with Grilled Vegetables, Brown Butter Caulifower, and mini desserts (Lemon Meringue Tart, Cheesecake, Flourless Chocolate Cake). Drinks consisted of water, iced tea and coffee.NEGATIVES:1) The room temperature in the Van De Kamp Hall. It was seriously so hot inside.2) Buffet Set up: They had the buffet items against the wall. If they had it out more then people could get food from both sides of the table. We were table #4 (out of 18 tables) and near the last to get to the buffet. Our luncheon started at 11:30AM. The food wasn't ready until noon and I didn't even get to the buffet line until 1:00PM! (omg... starving!)3) Food: I didn't care for the Tilapia. It tasted really fishy and after a bite, didn't want anymore. The chicken was so overpowered by Rosemary. My chicken was cooked fine, but a few of my coworkers mentioned that their chicken was undercooked while others said their was overcooked.The desserts were awesome though!Overall, I enjoyed my time and would take my husband here for a nice stroll...however I'm not sure if I would use their catering. The gift shop sells ornaments, books, jams, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleneC393
40,A lovely place to stroll,"We love to spend a few hours here strolling the flower gardens. It is a small botanical garden that I remember visiting as a child. Many people bring small children in strollers. The tulips were in full bloom.There is a historical house that was built by the original owners of the property that will give you the history of the gardens. The gift shop is small, but has some unique items and plants to start your own garden. On weekends there is usually a special event (flower shows, etc.) And there is a small ride-on train for kids.Plenty of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MVCA0Traveler
50,Simply beautiful.,"It is been 12 years that I am going to Descanso Gardens. Every time it is different, every time it is beautiful. The best time to visit is March and April, when the most of camellias are in bloom, plus all spring flowers, including tulips, fruit trees, daffodils, and garden full of lilac. The garden is perfect for a day from city, family with kids, romantic date, anything. Area is not very big and has different themes plus some hidden paths, ponds, tea room. They change the garden annually, it is different every next season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slonichek
40,Very pretty in spite of the drought,"We have been there twice, two years ago in early January it looked prettier than this year with all the heat at the end of January which is closer to the high season of February through March. The drought seems to have taken it's toll on the Camelias, but the rest of the park was just as lovely as before. It is a very quiet refuge so close to the city and a great place for a meditative walk for a few hours. On both occasions they had camelia flower competitions inside, perhaps they have competitions throughout the season, they are truly beautiful flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1244WRgregp
40,Quiet in L.A.,"While visiting LA, my friend and I sought out a quiet bit of nature and we were not disappointed. It was in the middle of the week with very few people around. The camellias were in bloom. We were able to stroll and talk and hear ourselves think. It seemed like a wonderful place to bring young children with a small train ride around the grounds. It's a modest oasis with small pleasures to be found for an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachwalker2011
50,Calm and natural beauty in LA,"Marvelous place to spend at least half a day. I visited on a weekend just before Christmas, so crowds relatively light, but probably best to make a mid-week visit if you can plan that. Gardens are a great surprise for LA with a great number of camellias and the fern grove is a great place to linger on a hot day. The miniature rail is a bonus for the children. The cafe provides a good range of food and drink at excellent prices",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobO528
50,Nature In The City,"These gardens are absolutely gorgeous. A calm and quiet Japanese garden complete with tea house. During my visit the gardens were decorated with tons of pumpkins and a crazy little hay bale maze for children to romp. We took family photos in the rose garden. Watched bunnies hopping through the bushes, squirrels running up and down the tall trees and gigantic carp swimming lazily in a pond. There was so much more to see but the day was ending so we had to leave. Can't wait to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lih
50,A wonderful way to spend an afternoon (or a day),"Descanso Gardens is a gem. Wander around the ponds, read a book in the rose garden, follow the little train, view art in the Sturt Haaga Gallery, picnic near the herb garden or grab a bite to eat at the cafe. Plan to take time to take it all in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883RobynM
50,Lovely retreat,"My kids grew up going here for everything from scouting events (my girls bridged to junior Girl Scouts from Brownies), to rides on the little train, to plays, to relaxing weekends as a family. I love the seasonal plants, the teahouse, and the overall ambiance. 25+ years later, I still go for the beautiful setting and the solitude. (I wasn't able to check off more than 1 type of visit. It's good for families with young children, teens, and solo, in my opinion.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2xntrik
50,All you can want,"I started going to Descanso Gardens before I ever moved to La Canada over 28 years ago. After my son could walk, Descanso became a regular site to visit to feed the koi, watch for birds, insects, and other exciting ""boy"" type interests. It was more ""rustic"" then with paths that were not designated, paved and sporadically cleaned. I loved it. It created a feeling of exploration and surprise. Many an imaginary snake or wild animal was spotted scurrying over the next rise.The Gardens have evolved over the last 15 years. There is much more of an organized, commercial feeling but that is a bad change. I miss wandering through the art exhibits at the Boddy House but the new addition of the Haaga Gallery keeps art displays and other exhibits on the grounds. I understand the necessity of using all parts of Descanso to hopefully make it self-sufficient and here for generations to come so I welcome the changes and welcome the opportunity to visit such a beautiful place. Something will always be in bloom or just observe the wonder of winter hibernation for preservation.The parking is great, the grounds are just the right size for a day at the Gardens, the gift shop is packed with interesting items, they offer classes and plant sales, lectures and help to those, like me, who have problems keeping an air fern alive.Visit. You will enjoy it. Guaranteed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoiderella
50,Very relaxing and Worth the trip. Should not be in a rush.,"We are so happy to have visited this beautiful place. Loved seeing the manmade lake. Saw an egret bird standing nearby. Kids loved that. The Koi fishes in the Japanese garden were amazing. We took some really pretty pictures here. The geese and her goslings were strolling right by us. My father-in-law was in a wheelchair and we were still able to get around everything. We missed the train but next time, we will get in line for that first thing. Perfect place to see the beautiful butterflies. They were everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33jennac
50,Beautiful place to visit,I was given an annual membership as a gift by a friend. It is a beautiful place to visit when lilacs bloom. In Spring you can enjoy all kinds of flowers blooming. They also offer Tai Qi classes on certain weekday mornings. For members you get to enjoy the garden 1 hour before they open to public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WandererSun
40,Beautiful Botanical Garden,"Great little botanical garden tucked away in La Canada Flintridge. Descanso Gardens isn't as big as places like the Huntington Library but that is what I kind of like. I have been here several times now on both week days and weekends and there has always been ample parking and the park hasn't ever been all that crowded...which when you are trying to escape the hustle and bustle of city life, its a welcome change of pace.Descanso features a very nice Rose Garden, Japanese Tea Garden (just ok) along with a mini art gallery just to name a few. Exploring around the property is half the fun of going to a botanical garden and in this regard Descanso doesn't disappoint. There are paved paths along with hiking trails so there is really a little bit for everyone. Along with that there is also a paid tour where you hop on linked cars and you are taken all over the garden to learn its history and significance. There is also a really cute mini train. The train is a couple feet tall and has numerous cars that kids (and lots of adults) sit on and take a quick spin around a portion of the park. The tickets are $3 per ride. Admissions are relatively low at $9 per person for general admission and kids for $4.Overal, it isn't a bad place to spend an afternoon or the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695robp
50,Absolutely breathtaking,"Richard Hong was our tram tour guide and his demeanor, knowledge and care for his passengers was remarkable. Although it was a tad expensive for party of 5 it was a most enjoyable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deacontomgrant
40,Descanso Gardens,"If you are in the area, La Canada has a hidden gem to share with you! Great for a 2 hour outing ...can bring a picnic or purchase food at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/208andrea
50,"Beautiful camellia gardens, amd other gorgeous flowers","We love Descanso Gardens. It is very restful, cool in the summer, delightful in every season. Great place to take children! The many varieties of camellias blooming under the wonderful old oak trees provide a lovely ambience for strolling on the many paths. There are art displays, ducks in the ponds, wild birds, many types of roses in the springtime along with other colorful flowers. The gift shop has many garden-related items. There is food for purchase and I believe that the tea house is open again. We often take visiting guests here for an afternoon walk. The question regarding who the gardens are for cannot be answered with a single checkmark. The gardens are for everyone, all ages. Sometimes there is a train that takes you around if you want to ride and another train for children that operates certain hours. When were we there? Many, many times over the last 52 years! You can enjoy a visit here for as long as you want to stay, certainly several hours (within the time they are open each day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizcraven
40,Neighborhood treasure,"Great to walk, quiet, or busy, beautiful in all seasons, volunteers' care lets you know it is important to lots of people. Special events keep something new to look forwards to. Nice for photos or just to sit and reflect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoiderella
50,Beautiful little gem of a garden!,"This enchanting little garden is a perfect place to unwind & enjoy nature, get married, or have photographs taken. The rose gardens are spectacular, the Japanese garden is peaceful, and the Camellia forest is wondrous. There is a train for kids too. I was surprised to find that many people were unaware of this garden, or that the cafe here is part of the Patina Group. This garden was so beautiful that I decided to become a member (which has a reciprocal program with other gardens nationwide for free admission) and have enjoyed the gardens even more frequently ever since!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mystica33
40,A beautiful place to spend the day,"I love these gardens! There are what seems to be miles of walking paths through various shaded and sunny areas. There are benches scattered around for sitting, some fountains, etc. The museum/house is nothing special, but it's also not the focus of the attraction. I have been there during all 4 seasons and there is always something beautiful to see.I love taking a snack and a book and sitting for a few hours just enjoying the peaceful outdoor atmosphere. As a tourist attraction, this is a one-time wonder. As a peaceful place to get away: I would get a season pass if I lived there and would probably go at least once a week. As it is, when I visit family in California I always spend at least one afternoon here.If I could change one thing, I would expand the gift shop and have a larger range of items and less scented ones (I am asthmatic and the overwhelming number of fake floral scents prevents me from spending more than a few minutes inside). Also, I would love to see a premiere food vendor there - it would be heavenly to get a fresh baguette sandwich, or salad or something similar. I wouldn't like to see it turned into cheap food vending areas....but a tiny gourmet selection would make the day even more enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534RobinS
20,Too bad. Hope they do something about it. Disappointing.,"I'm very sad to write this review. But I hope it gets someone's attention and does something about it. I visited Descanso last month, when the garden is suppose to be in bloom, lush and green, for our anniversary. We drove an hour and half to get there, booked a room for the night so we don't feel rushed. I was looking forward to this yearly trip to Descanso, sadly only to be disappointed. The gardens were not looked after very well at all. The Rose Garden looked awful with weeds everywhere, some taller than the rose plant next to it. The large green spaces were gone and replaced by brown mulch. The only section that looked decent was the entrance. It was like they lost the caretaker, or something. What happened? In all these 10 years or so I've been going there, I have never seen Descanso in a bad way till now. It was so disappointing. I hope they do something about it, and return it to its former glory. I will surely not go there anytime soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamelliaS_12
40,Pleasant gardens with an enjoyable Hollywood Regency style house,"This was just the spot for cousins to reconnect away from the hustle-bustle of Los Angeles--lunching outdoors, strolling the gardens, touring the 1937 home of E. Manchester Boddy, the founder of the Los Angeles Daily News.The gardens offer paths for strolling with plenty of shady options on a hot afternoon. We also enjoyed exploring the house, which has that 1930s Hollywood vibe, also knowing that it was a spot for legendary parties on a hilltop overlooking an exquisite garden. The excellent docent told us Boddy's story, a real rags to riches much like the Great Gatsby, except it ended happily. You cold read Boddy's clippings and get a feel for his generous spirit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WideEyedTraveler
50,A Garden Paradise,"This garden offers a variety of experiences, from walking through extensive groves of mature oaks (mostly coast live oaks), small stands or redwoods, camelia gardens, a huge rose garden to include a collection of historic roses, an art gallery, and the Body House, which was a featured house for the Pasadena Showcase House. There is also a beautiful Japanese Tea House and garden complete with pond, koi, and a variety of mature azaleas that bloom profusely in the spring time. Drinks and snacks are served in the summer evenings...just delightful. The gardens is also home to a music performances for picnickers during the day on the weekends and on Thursday evening throughout the summer. There are also performances for families on Tuesday evenings. Be sure to bring a camara and walking shoes, although there is a tram for those not wishing to walk. The large pond a the bird pavilion is a little low right now. This is also a great venue for weddings, although a bit expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristieC665
50,Just Right for a Few Hours,"Los Angeles County has three beautiful garden locales: the Arboretum, Huntington Library,and Descanso Gardens. And how lucky for that. While Huntington is huge, Descanso Gardens is beautiful in its size--totally doable in one day.Art gallery, the Boddy House, and gardens of every variety mix up the beautiful walk. Bring a camera and a water bottle and enjoy. From mighty oaks to delicate water lillies and abundant roses, there's a garden for everyone.Call ahead to make sure there is a tram, or be prepared to walk more. But it's completely walkable. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,Beautiful Spot in La Canada,"My wife, daughter, my wife's cousin and I visited the famous Descanso Gardens on Sunday, May 26th. The gardens are a beautiful setting with huge old oak trees in abundance along with several special areas like the Boddy House, Magnolia Lawn, Japanese Garden and Tea House, Rose Garden and Pavilion and Lake along with a café and the usual gift shop. It's a great place to just stroll the magnificent grounds and enjoy nature, flowers and plants of all kinds. A true gem in Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonc11
40,Great. Place for visit.,The gardens a beautiful and a walk through the rose garden is wonderful with all the roses in bloom. The perfumes from them were wonderful. Great variety of areas to walk round Saor just sit and take in the beauty of the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaB413
50,Relaxing place to walk with lots of shade,"Wonderful place to walk, lots of shade, and places to sit and enjoy your surroundings. Historical home and information about how the garden was developed was very interesting and added to a wonderful visit. Cute gift shop with native plants for sale was an added bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debrick79
50,A Bit of Paradise in a Garden,"My boyfriend and I went to Descanso Gardens and took a long walk past camellias that were tree-size, lovely roses, clivias, irises and even Coast Redwood trees. Descanso means rest or repose in Spanish and I can truly say that the place inspires relaxation with its beauty. The Rose Garden has more than 3,000 roses in 5 acres. It is also the home of the largest camellia collection in the U.S. Then, there is the fascinating Japanese Garden, with its koi, waterfalls, arched bridges and Full Moon Tea House. No, that's not all. There's also an Oak forest, a Lilac Garden and a California Garden. There is a guided tour by tram, if you like that kind of thing. I prefer to walk and explore on my own. The place is magical!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Favorite Place to Relax in the Los Angeles Area,"I have been coming to Descanso for over 40 years. Unlike most places, the few changes that have been made, I believe, have all been for the better. This is not a huge garden, like the Huntington, but offers something different. Part is a formal rose garden, which is obviously spectacular much of the year. There is a small man-made lake which has fun birds. There were 2 Canadian geese there on my last visit. There's a Japanese tea house which is very picturesque.But my favorite is, and has always been, walking through the forest of camellia bushes on unpaved little trails. There's something about Not having to stay on the pavement, Not having to stay on a trail, that makes this really feel like you are in the woods alone. The beautiful camellias may grow as high as 20 feet. Over them is a canopy of oak trees. It is obviously most beautiful when the camellias are blooming (starting in late February?), but is peaceful any time of year. And no matter how crowded the Garden is, it seems you can always find an area in the camellia forest where you are alone. Quite spectacular!The little snack bar as you enter the gardens makes excellent, gourmet sandwiches. There is a very nice gift shop and small plant nursery.Descanso currently charges $8 entry for non-member adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanieM101
50,Beautiful,I love this beautiful manicured garden - especially the Japanese Garden. It's a well cared for garden that evokes peace and tranquility.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/303ConnieS
40,"Lovely gardens, very relaxing","After some busy days in the city, it was lovely to stroll around the gardens and just relax for the day. The paths were easy to follow, nothing too strenuous. Plenty of places to stop and sit and just take in the scenery and plants. Lilacs smelt amazing. While I'm not a gardener myself, it was nice to see such a variety of plants and just enjoy the lovely setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariceNZ
50,Beautiful gardens,"These Gardens are amazing. I was there about 5 years ago and forgot how beautiful they are. A narrated tram ride takes you through the Gardens - right now tulips and camelias are the main attraction there! What could be bad? Gorgeous. Nice cafe offering sandwiches, wraps, salads and grilled foods. A great gift shop. It's a wonderful day. Don't forget the mini-train - minimal cost and fun for kids as well as adults! GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelalot32136
30,Lots of potential,"This is a great horticultural collection. We went at just the right week - last in March - the camellias, lilacs tulips and others were out. Its a manageable size - not too large nor too small. Some of the displays need a little more attention by the maintenance folks - the pond at the Japanese Garden was pretty murky and low, and a number of the elements needed some TLC. There is a little train which you can ride which is cute. It seems to be a destination of choice for families with young children though, so if you don't like a steady background soundtrack of shrieks and yells, then this might not be for you. The amenities are well done - there is a lovely gift shop and small grill/restaurant with outdoor patio seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tp21-5649
40,Beautiful but Wrong Month,"This was one of very few attractions open in or near Pasadena on a Tuesday. We were lucky to visit on a weekday to avoid crowds; however, we did not get to see the full splendor of this place since the camellias were getting tired, and the roses were not yet out. The Japanese Garden was gorgeous, and the Boddy House lifted the whole experience for us to a four out of five.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayM506
50,Gorgeous!,"What a treat to visit in late March when the lilacs, cherry trees, camellias, and tulips are in full bloom! On a weekday it was very peaceful and a feast for the senses. It's easy to walk around the gardens, although there is a tram and a small train also. The gift shop is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
30,Expected more,"We happened to go on the cherry blossom weekend so we had a 45 minute wait just to get into the park, which I heard is not typical. So unless you're going for a specific check the events page of the website to make there it's not a special weekend.So despite the wait, it was a beautiful day to be outside. The property is quite large, but 80% of it is just oak trees and camellias. If the camellias had not been somewhat blooming, there would not have been much to see. What we did see: About a dozen cherry trees in blossom, which are quite beautiful. The tulip garden was quite spectacular with beds of different colored flowers. The lilac garden was nice, but you can tell they don't really thrive in SoCal climate. The roses were not in bloom yet.Other than the very front of the garden, there is not much to see. It is more like walking through a park than a botanical garden. I expected the grounds to be much more manicured like the Huntington Library or even the small garden at the Getty center. For $8, I can't complain too much. It just wasn't quite what we expected from a botanical garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garywQ1245HN
40,"Tulips, tulips, and cherry blossoms!","I recently visited the Descanso Gardens and was very happy to see so many tulips. There were red, pink, white, purple, and yellow tulips galore. In fact, some were gigantic and it took me by surprise to see them so large. I was snapping pictures like crazy as were many others. Besides the beautiful tulips, all of the cherry blossom trees are in bloom. It's such a sight to see especially along the small lake. There is a small train ride for an additional fee which takes you around the gardens. If you have young kids, they will love it but the gardens themselves are small enough to walk through. The rose garden is not yet in bloom so I would give it another month or so if you'd like to see them. Overall, a great little escape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,"Best time to visit is late March, early April","I visited the garden at the end of February, and although there were many beautiful camellias in bloom, not much else was flowering at this time. It is a quiet and peaceful spot, very large and spread out, with lots of wooded areas. The home on the property is worth a look. The entrance fee was $8, and there's a nice little cafe and gift shop site. If you must choose between the Huntington and the Descanso Gardens, I would definitely go to the Huntington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbara_Antle
40,Beautiful Local Spot,"My most recent trip was with my boyfriend and his father (visiting from England) last March, but I grew up nearby and have been many times over the years, including for a beautiful garden wedding.Descanso Gardens is a local gem. It's a bit more wild and woodsy than The Huntington, but I like that aspect of it. It's small enough to see the whole thing, but big enough to feel like you have the place to yourself.I really love the house at the top, which is part art gallery and museum. It was also recently a show house. They have artist in residents and many years ago, we bought a piece from artist Dory Grade, that still hangs in our living room.I'm not sure if they still offer it, but about ten years ago, I took a night time tour of the gardens to see bats. We have a very informative guide and got a special view of the gardens, capped off with coffee and dessert. If they still offer this, I highly recommend it, as long as you're not fearful of spiders!This is a beautiful spot for tourists and locals. It's a must-do!If you are looking to plan a wedding, this a great spot. The garden wedding that I attended was romantic and beautiful.Please visit my blog for more reviews and local outings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
50,An unexpected oasis in the city,"Want to get away from the LA urban sprawl and crush of people for a couple of hours? This is the place. The grounds are shaded by large California oaks, redwoods and other exotic trees. That would be enough, but the real delight is the thousands of camellia bushes -- some over 12 feet tall -- planted among the trees and in flower this time of year. You can stay on the paved roads or ride a tram (extra cost) or head off on on of the many footpaths and feel completely alone even on a busy weekend.The main house (this used to be a private estate) is a lovely surprise. It is gracious in design and beautifully decorated. It was a designer showcase house in 2007, with many lovely room and interesting history panels about the Boddy family and how the gardens came to be.Wandering farther on the 165 acres, you will also find a rose garden, a lake and an Audubon bird watch house, koi ponds and a Japanese garden. And all of this for less than a $10 ticket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscar505
50,Peaceful place with many interesting plant varieties,"I visited this site with some good friends and we found it to be a wonderful, peaceful place to visit with a variety of interesting plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnowChik
50,Outstanding botanical garden,"This long time garden has an outstanding collection of more than 10,000 Camellias growing under huge oak trees, a pond with koi, a stream surrounded with beautiful trees, a huge rosé garden, an historical original owner's mansion, and tranquil Japanese garden, etc. a perfect garden for all ages. Viewing different seasonal flowers. This is one of the best gardens you must visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR
50,wonderful experience,"I joined the membership and I was quite impressed by the large grounds of beautiful gardens. The gift shop had a wide variety and we bought several unique items. Loved the tram tour (1hr), the train was not running the day we went due to ""misty"" weather. We go to the Huntington Library Gardens frequently and so I was not expecting much at this garden, but was pleasantly suprised that it was a totally different, woodsy experience. I felt like I was hiking in the forest with winding trails through different gardens-large oak trees, camilias, roses,the japanese garden.. It was relaxing with several stops/benches, anarondak chairs to ponder the nature of a quiet, serene atmosphere, loved the Boddy house, not a wooden shack that we expected. A perfect ""nature"" day, lots of birds, squirrels and deer. Several ""kid"" area and events and 2 stages of adult entertainment, but the snack/food bar was not up to par-food was premade and packaged-one salad and 3 kinds of sandwiches...bring your own or go after eating elsewhere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truffles1354
40,Beautiful Gardens off the beaten track,The camilias here are outstanding but don't miss the bulbs - tulips of every variety and color in the spring,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoeopa
50,A place of respite for the soul in any season! Looks different every time I visit.,"This is a place that is true to it's name. ""Descansar""- means to rest in Spanish. Years ago, I was looking for a garden type place to go to that is both relaxing and interesting; that is when I found Descanso. This is a beautiful place that can hold one's interest for a long time. I first visited it in the fall when the Ginko tree was golden, with leaves strewn about like golden flakes against the green grass. It was a picture to behold. The diffent species of camelia were just beginning to bloom. When you come in the winter, the place holds one of the largest, if not the largest collection of camelias in the west. In the spring, it is a showcase of tulips, daffoldills, and a variety of bulbs in bloom. And in some parts of the garden, the air is filled with the scent of jasmine that lingers on as you enjoy the colorful blooms. When the cherry blossoms are in bloom, it is so uplifting that I just pick a spot to sit, and I forget all else. In the summer, the endless variety of roses, one of the largest collections this side of the divide, will keep on hopping from bloom to bloom, smelling and admiring for hours. I have been coming to the garden for years, and still each time, I discovery a little something in a nook that I have never seen before. The ferns are always there in different shades green, the bright orange clivias that so captivating, I find myself going under trees and bushes to follow the trail. I was fortunate to buy the book in the little store that explains the history of the place, the Body house, Japanese garden, and so many details that would be easily overlooked, but adds so much richness to the experience. I am sure I have left out so many details, but that is for you to discover. For a small fee of $8, it can't be beat. I wish I lived closer, I would certainly be here everyday. A visit in the early morning when the fog hasn't completely listed is magical. Everytime I come, no matter what time of day or year, it has something just a little bit different to offer. Truly a delight and a rest to the soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamelliaS_12
50,A bit of Heaven in La Canada-Flintridge,"This is a place not to be missed in the Spring when the tulips are all in bloom, but it's beautiful anytime of the year, really. The forest of camellias is amazing when the trees are in bloom, and yes, they are trees! It's a special day when you can spend it at Descanso!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puttermutt17
40,Beautiful place,"I enjoyed the mini art display on the grounds, apparently this is relatively new, and I had never seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbies717
50,attention flower lovers,"exceptional variety of flowers, huge grounds......many acres of camelias, iris, fruit trees;different every season. Tram ride for those who don''t like to hike. Must see.Lunch afterwards in Monterey Park full of Asian restaurant about 10 minutes away.One of the best botanical sites in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinoc967
50,Peaceful & Gorgeous,"I grew up around here & visited these sublime gardens regularly. A vision of the Garden of Eden. I loved the camellias, as they remind me of my grandmother. What's your favorite flower? It's somewhere here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
50,A unique vision,"Every botanical site has its own vision, and this one reflects the history of Los Angeles. The owner and builder, Manchester Bodie was a seminal figure in the early growth and poitics of Los Angeles. The garden has evolvede through several spurts of growth, including a tribute to the Japanese population of LA. More recently, the Haagas, a La Canada family funded a state of the art gallery that features a vertical garden ( which was highlighted in Sunset magazine).The garden is broken into several areas, roses, native plants, a duck pond, koi streams, the Bodie House, flower gardens, and of course the extensive and famous camelia forest.Descanso is small enough to embrace and is a great place to let a child roam freely. I prefer it to the LA Botanical Garden , but place it below Huntington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrKeithEvan
50,tulip time,"We went to see the tulips and it was amazing! It's a peaceful place to be, the walkways and variety of plants just revives you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snoopydance
40,Hidden retreat,"On the first day of our vacation we visited the Huntington Gardens, followed by the Getty Museum the next day. Nothing can really compare to those, so it's hard to put Descanso in perspective, but we really enjoyed our morning here. Spent about 3 hours, including touring the home and small separate contemporary gallery. The gardens are not at their peak in July - with so many rhodedendrons I expect them to be better in April or May. But overall this is a lovely place, and you definitely know you are at a place for true garden afficionados and not just flocks of tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnsheepishlySeattle
50,Very Beautiful,A wonderful place to take your family. Beautifully landscaped and maintained,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaR377
50,Most beautiful garden ever!,"I've been to the Huntington Gardens and the Arcadia Aboretum. I would have to say that the Descanso Gardens is the most beautiful gardens that I've ever been to. A lot of it has to do with the right timing. I came in early April in 2011, and that was right when the cherry blossoms bloomed in the Japanese garden. The lilacs were also in bloom, and they smell really good. The tulip bulbs were planted. My husband and I were extremely lucky that we took our engagement pictures that time. I also came in May, and the flowers were different. The cherry blossoms and lilacs were no longer in bloom. However the roses were in bloom. Descanso Gardens has the most beautiful rose garden I've ever seen. They had every single variety and shade of roses that you could possibly think of. It's such a gorgeous garden. You would have to come here multiple times a year to catch all the different flowers that are in bloom, but it's totally worth it. If it's your first time visiting, I would strongly recommend taking the tram tour so you'll get an idea exactly when and where the flowers will bloom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chochang77
40,Beautiful Garden for A Simple Day of Touring,"This is a nice and inexpensive way to spend the day in a quiet and serene atmosphere. No crowds, no lines for rides, just a tranquil and gorgeous property to wander around. The tram ride will take you all over (check their web site for times), and the original residence around which this property was built before being deeded over as a botanical garden is open for tours (and the tram saves you a walk if you're of that mindset). There's even a simple but soothing museum in the now-converted garage building that includes Japanese-inspired musical art - see the picture, it's a slowly melting block of gravel supported over musically tuned tubes of metal - I hadn't seen anything like it before.There's flowers, a Japanese Tea House (sadly, no longer serving tea), a decent food service, waterscapes, a bird sanctuary, and small brooks babbling throughout. It's easy to get to in La Canada-Flintridge - the 210 freeway or the Glendale (Hiway 2) freeway take you right to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GibsonCRG
50,Beautiful!,"Fantastic flowers. The cammilias were in bloom as well as cultivated beds of tulips. We spent a long morning not only looking at the flowers, but the japanese garden, native plants, water gardens and a large canopy of costal redwoods. Well worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaggieK543
40,Great for enjoying the day,"Pleasant grounds, quiet, and great for just enjoying being outside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miscchris
40,"Spring flowers,tranquil forest and freeway close to LA","I have been to these gardens dozens of times, as I grew up in San Gabriel valley and parents always brought on Sunday ""drives"" to inexpensive locales. I can say that through the years this garden gets better and better! There is also a large shade tree area for hosting a picnic lunch with a number of picnic tables or just spread a large blanket on the oak leaf covered grass/ground. The Brody House tucked into the back ""foothills"" of the property is interesting and picturesque by itself, and to get to it you see the beautiful camelia forest and clivia a bloom in Spring and some of the flowering trees near the ""train station"" and the rose paviollion. I also love to go to the Audobon (birdwatching) area -(note the entryway is wheelchair accessible) where there is an old Calif. oak estimated at 250-300 years old, and a small manmade ""lake"" where there are koi or catfish and water turtles. I sometimes sneak a 1/4 loaf of stale bread with me and throw it into the edge of the lake, where dozens of sunning turtles quickly notice and swim toward the viewing platform! But really, the main forest area, rose paviollion (where there are also beautiful irises blooming now), and native Calif. areas are my favorite. As another reviewer said, it's fairly inexpensive entrance (student & child discounts also) and easy to navigate the whole gardens in an afternoon. The gift shop has lots of childrens items, garden books, and other gift treasures plus plants and pots for sale. As another reviewer said, the cafe has good food and lemonade plus ice cream bars, but if you go on Mother's Day or congested weekend you will have to wait in long lines for food. Go and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelmom_fun
40,Nice garden,My wife and I visited Descanso garden in April. It's nicely laid out and the outer ring doesn't take long to walk. For us the Japanese garden was the highlight. Third Tuedays of the month are free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkinMontreal
50,Peaceful Haven Close to Los Angeles,"This garden is so accessible. The entrance fee is reasonable. The food in the cafe is great. The garden itself is a pleasant experience for anyone who enjoys Southern California landscaping at its best. It is small enough to touch on everything in one visit, but every day is a new adventure as the seasons and the coming and going of plants and animals are constantly changing. ONe can observe a multitude of birds, and we enjoy watching the white snow goose ""mothering"" over the multitude of ducks in the lake. The California live oaks are enchanting, and the camellia forests are vast. A really special experience for any age!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SistersontheMove
50,An Amazing Place,"Originally planted many decades ago, Descanso Gardens is a must see for any local or visitor who likes to visit botanical gardens. The camelias,under old oak trees, comprise North America's largest collection. But these camelias aren't like the kind in your mom's yard. These camelias bushes (no, trees, not bushes) are old, established and huge. There's also a beautiful rose garden, and a huge tulip planting done every spring. February March is the best time to view the camelias in bloom. Go early. Nearby is the village of Montrose. The town that time forgot. The shops harken back to the 50s, dotted here and there with some interesting restaurants. Worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indyblonde
50,A beautiful birthday party and a ride on the Enchanted Railroad,"Descanso Gardens is a beautiful place to visit and fun for all ages from the very young to the very old. The gates open at 8am, though the gardens do not open until 9am. It has plenty of free parking. Admission is $8 for 12 and older, $6 for seniors and students, $3 for kids 5 -11, free for kids 4 and under. Group rates are $6/person for groups of 25 or more. Train tickets are $3/ticket for anyone riding with height requirement 30 inches and book of tickets are available for $25/10 tickets or $2.50 a ride. Picnic area available next to the parking lot where you are allowed to bring your own food. Cafe inside the gardens about $8/sandwich. Tram tours also available for $4/rider. If you walk on your own, takes about 1 hour to see most of the gardens and we did not go to the historic buildings, so may take about 2 hours total for a complete visit. there are lots of little waterfalls, ponds with large koi fish, bridges, and a lake with lots of ducks. February has the camellia festival and most of the other flowers are not in bloom yet.My son loves trains and we wanted to have his birthday party where he and his friends could ride a train. We had beautiful weather with almost no wind. We set up his party in the picnic area outside the gardens. Luckily for us, a boy scout troop had decided for their project to paint all the tables and benches the week before our party. So we went at 8am to reserve the tables and set up our decorations and food. (The gardens do not allow ""outside food"" to be brought in and renting the rooms requires about a $400 fee plus catering and service from the Patina group starting at about $100/person, maybe $80/kid.) Guests included babies, toddlers, elementary age kids, parents, grandparents, and a great grandma in her 80s. The picnic area was a large space where the kids could run around and climb on trees. After lunch, we all rode together on the railroad. It fits about 18-20 adults/kids per ride and takes about 5 minutes. it took about 3 rides for everyone in our group to get a ride. Then it was time for birthday cake. After the party, many of the guests returned to the gardens for family pictures and just to explore and let the kids run around. it was a fun event and my son got to ride the train 3 times that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradleysmom
50,Peaceful green,"I always enjoy my visits to the gardens. Anytime of the year it's colorful. The Boddy House is beautiful. The recently opened art gallery is wonderful. great food at the cafe. There is a small scale train ride that seems to be very popular with families. Also there is a Japanese tea house. All in all it's a fantastic place to spend a few hours. If you need a break from the hustle and bustle of city life, try the Descanso.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7320UP
40,beautiful any time of the year,"Gardens are beautiful anytime of the year but really special when the camellias are in bloom, late winter. Summer is spectacular as well. Lovely escape from the heat with all the trees and ponds. Summer also brings evening concerts on the grass. Some folks pack a picnic. Food venues at the gardens are expensive and dissapointing. Better to grab a bite at a local restaurant before or after your visit. Best in town is Dish on foothill Blvd. Open for breakfast , lunch and dinner. Always great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jiml695
50,Beautiful Botanical Garden,"This has been a family favorite for years. It's a quiet garden with beautiful oaks, rose garden, edible landscape garden, tea house and lovely water gardens. A peaceful place to walk alone or share with friends. End the visit by taking a peek inside the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLOCoaster
50,Camellia Capital!,"Beautiful gardens, especially in springtime. The camellias are the showstoppers, however they have tulips in season and a nice display of roses. Old Pasadena at it's best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calred53
50,Something beautiful every season for nature lovers of all ages.,"I have visited Descanso Gardens through every month of the year for many years and it never disappoints. It's January and the camellias are budding and in various stages of bloom, creating a forest of color of magical proportions. Take the arched foot bridge to visit the Japanese Full Moon Tea House flanked by giant bamboo, where you can sit near the ponds and streams and experience the serenity of watching the beautiful koi fish. Check the schedule on the Descanso Garden Facebook page to for hours of refreshment service during the Summer at the Tea House. A carefully swept and patterned Zen pebble garden adds to the romantic atmosphere. This is the setting for the theme garden with beautiful cherry and plum blossoms in bloom in Spring. If you want to stretch your legs and get your blood pumping, there are several paths that offer an elevation gain through the rose gardens and up to the Bird Observation area which overlooks a lake that hosts a large variety of birds, including ducks, coots, snowy egrets and I have even seen the majestic blue heron so bring your binoculars and a camera. The kids I have taken there really love this outpost.There are many garden benches offering a place to rest or just to sit and listen to the many streams accentuated by the brilliantly designed landscape and hardscape. Take the pathway on up to the lovely Boddy House, part of the Rancho del Descanso, home to the former owner of the estate which is now Descanso Gardens. There are paved walkways throughout the gardens allowing those with mobility devices to enjoy a rich garden experience. There is a large grassy area and an amphitheater where live performances enhance your experience throughout the summer. The sound of jazz or other musical genre playing through the gardens is particularly pleasing. While famous for the amazing camellias, Descanso is home to a Rose Garden, A seasonal fruit and vegetable garden area, an Iris garden and lilac garden. Docents offer a very educational tram ride and an Enchanted Train Ride is another treat for the kids. The gift store really has some delightful items for people of all ages and even a great selection of condiments, teas and jams, fragrant spa products, seeds and books, videos and it is hard to resist some of the theme items for gardeners or garden lovers. Check the hours for the refreshment/luncheon stand near the entrance. I have enjoyed romantics walks with my husband, imagination inspired adventures with young children and leisurely strolls with elderly parents. We usually take bottles of water with us because we often spend much more time exploring than we anticipate. The scenery changes so much that it is never boring and we discover new plants with almost every visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/making_magic
50,Beautiful gardens in a beautiful location,I spent several hours wandering around the gardens and around every turn there was another delight. The Japanese Garden is breathtaking. Definitely recommend visiting the Boddy House and the new art gallery adjacent to the house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicago0123
50,My Favorite Gardens,"I love coming here at any time of year but in the fall is my favorite. With living in San Diego, you don't get a lot of the color changes. There are quite a few trees here that are just gorgeous in the fall. At the entrance there is a gift shop and an outside dining area. Further into the garden there is a small train ride for the kids. There is also a tram that takes you through parts of the garden if you can't walk it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
50,"Gorgeous botanicals and property - ponds, trails, historic mansion",Descanso Gardens has something for everyone and for all ages. I went in early June 2011 and it was perfect timing for everything in bloom. The grounds are meticulously kept and it is easy to navigate around the site. There is a cafe onsite if you get hungry after walking around and ample shade and seating to sit and rest. They even have a mini tram going around if you want to get your bearings first before taking your time at each section. The rose gardens were my favorite with the variety and the koi pond was beautiful and peaceful. It is a perfect place to take personal photos and I recommend bringing a nice camera. The staff are very professional and they have a very extensive gift shop that I found a lot of unique gift ideas. I woud definitely buy a season pass if I lived closer because I would be there everyday to walk the property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasKPB
30,Beautiful gardens marred by rude ticket seller,"Last Thursday my 69-year old aunt, 9-year old daughter, and I visited Descanso Gardens. I have been going there for over 15 years and have always enjoyed the beautiful gardens. Due to my busy work schedule I hadn't been there in a few years and decided to purchase a family membership. I was a bit confused regarding what a family membership covered, and thought it was good for one adult and one child, so to cover my aunt, I purchased an additional senior ticket for her. The three of us were together when I purchased these tickets.During my visit I learned that the family membership was good for 2 adults and children under 12, therefore it was unnecessary to purchase the senior ticket. After our visit, I went back to the ticket booth and explained the situation and asked for a refund for that ticket. The ticket seller was incredibly rude and gruff. She handed me a piece of paper and told me to fill it out, and then very rudely pointed to some information that I had overlooked. I was so startled and dismayed by her treatment of me, that I asked ""I am right, aren't I?"" to which she replied, ""I don't know, I wasn't there!"" She handed me my six dollars and walked away.In all my years going there. I have NEVER encountered this kind of rudeness. I was tempted to cancel my membership. Instead of offering an apology for my being overcharged (the person who sold me the membership in the first place should have pointed out that the extra ticket was unnecessary) or even just being civil, this ticket seller was downright rude, as if it were an affront to her to be asking for this refund. It's unfortunate that such a lovely place is marred by such ugly behavior.I still recommend the gardens, but recommend that Descanso Gardens train and have better oversight of their staff, especially those at the front line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/violamom
50,A walk in paradise,"I've been to Descanso Gardens a dozen times, and each time is unique. Go in the cooler months when Camelias are blooming, in June for the roses.... heck! go any month and you will not be disappointed. Endless walking paths, waterfalls, ponds, shady areas, sunny vistas, formal gardens, its all there. I have spent a whole day there and when late afternoon falls, the gardens take on a shadowed, hushed appearance. Simply lovely, do make this botanical garden a thing-to-do on your vacation, or any time you wish a quiet get-away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandytravelbug
40,Peaceful Setting,"We decided to spend our staycation enjoying sites not too far from home, and that we had not been to before. Since it is December I was looking forward to the blooming Camillas. Unfortunately with our crazy, hot then cold, November and December, the flowers are a little mixed up, and the Camillas are not in full bloom yet. But, on the other hand, with the warm weather, the roses were still in full bloom.The garden has a beautiful canopy of trees which makes the garden very peaceful, and almost surreal. A father was playing tag with his two sons on the lawn, in the middle of the garden. We took the tram ride, which I highly recommend, as it provides the history of the gardens. It is so easy to remember days past in this lovely location.There is a cafe, though we brought a picnic lunch and ate on the picnic tables outside the gardens. It is a lovely shaded area for the hot summer days. There is a gift shop with floral objects.If you can go in April and May when the majority of the flowers are in bloom, I am sure you will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2trvlRedondoBeach
40,Pleasant morning,"I spent a very pleasant late June morning in these gardens which are known for extensive camellia plantings. Even though just a few of the camellias remained, the gardens were full of blooming roses, perennials, and other flowering plants. The trails and paths offer a variety of terrain and opportunities for watching birds and small wildlife. I especially liked the ""California Garden"" which has less manicured, meandering paths through sage scrub, chaparral hillsides, and native flowering shrubs. To complete the morning, my companion & I enjoyed a rest by the fish pond and then a delightful lunch at the courtyard cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HotSpringsNative
50,The loveliest morning possible,"I spent a morning at the Descanso Gardens in early April 2008 for the first time. The gardens are very close to Pasadena, a half hour from downtown LA. Camellias are my favourite flower and are scarce and only on small greenhouse shrubs here in Ontario. Imagine walking through a forest of TREES full of thousands of blossoms, all varieties and colours. Bring a picnic and relax. Don't forget to tour the Boddy House- it is now completely renovated and set up as a museum so you can learn the history of the estate. The bed garden was full of tulips, irises, and pansies. Roses were just starting as well. A really delightful addition to my trip to California. Parking is plentiful and free, and entrance to the gardens costs $7.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViewFromMe
