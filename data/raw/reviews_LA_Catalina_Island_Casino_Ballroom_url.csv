50,"Came for the Jazz Festival, love the Casino even more now!","This is just a wonderful vintage building built in 1929. We came for the Jazz festival and experiencing it at a live event made it that much more special. At intermission, we walked around the portico that goes all around it, saw the island at night, the lights from Avalon and the boats on the harbor, magical. The only downer was the smoking section they have out there.The jazz event we saw was over half empty when it started because many people buy the whole weekend of events and come and go, so that was a bummer. But it eventually filled up, older crowd, great acts, top notch, great sound, cool ceiling (see photos).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whenyoudream
50,Well worth it. Get a glimpse of history,"Rebecca our guide was knowledgeable and gave us some great stories. Was a surprising plus, and finding out about the theatre, the crowds that came here to dance from the mainland, often returning the same night. I could imagine easily the packed dance floor and fun times they must have had. Amazing engineering, built in 14 months in the late 20's... Go see it. Views are great too...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertjohnd787

50,Awesome,"Frankie gave us an afternoon tour and we came back later that evening to enjoy the movie! It was so fun. I wish we could have heard the organ, but it was Super Bowl Sunday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lunarooney
50,Historic and Iconic Ballroom,"The historic "" Casino"" never actually a casino is an art Deco masterpiece full of history. Arrange to take a tour or attend one of the many events held there .

50,Breath Taking!,Attended JazzTrax Jazz Festival on October 12-15. This Venue is CLASSY and CAPTIVATING. Full Breathtaking views of the surrounding Marina and Cove where Avalon is located. Open doors to the Balcony that wraps itself around the venue. And a Full Bar on the outskirts to help Tantalize for Fancy. Simply 'Living the Dream!',https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newimprovedc

50,A Must Visit in Avalon,You cannot go to Avalon and not visit the Casino. Take the tour and go see a movie if you can! Highly recommend the Behind The Scenes Tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanT56737
20,Disappointing overall,"Tour was a waste of time and money. i would find another activity. The movie shown about the ballroom was pretty good but we found the rest a complete bore. If you are looking for a Casino, there isn't one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaytrip50
10,Waste of money,This is a total joke! A huge waste of money! Half the time is spent with him dancing with each girl. The other half is spent on how he hit a home run with a 19 year old as a 13 year old. A complete farce!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haicshtravel
40,"Beautiful building, not much to visit",I’ve been wanting to come here since I was a child. So my expectations were high. We visited and toured it. If there wasn’t a guide I would’ve been beyond disappointed. The outside of the building is the best part. Not a lot to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinSuz
50,Just beautiful and so nostalgic!,"The history of this beautiful building is full of wonderful stories of Hollywood and other famous people attending ""The Casino"" in the day! It stands 89 years old but perfectly still in structural condition. This was built by Wrigley just before talkies. The theater is just so so beautiful with details and artistic paintings on the ceiling. The ballroom brings you back to the time when dancing to the BIG Bands was BIG! Surely one of the better tours on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P656QNjuliec
40,No Matter What You Will Pass The Casino But Here's The Secret That Makes It Great.,"Yes if the walls could talk you would be regaled of stories when Hollywood really did have stars, and the architecture is still well preserved but that is not the secret of the casino. They show movies here and various exhibits and activities that might interest but are you really going to see a movie that you can see anytime when visiting Catalina? You will walk right past the Casino on the way to the Beach club which is worth a visit but here's the secret. Go to the back of the casino and you will see steps that lead into the Ocean. Get your mask and snorkel on, look before you leap and go swimming. The area is protected from boats and has lots of fish and sea kelp forests to keep you interested. First equal swimming/snorkeling location in Catalina. Also when you're done remember you can change in the restrooms outside the Casino or walk on for five minutes to the beach club where you can take a shower and change. Have fun, stay safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB

Beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolccCNA

50,Tour of the Avalon Casino and Ballroom,"This tour is a must for anyone new to Catalina, especially if you like Art Deco architecture. The Casino is 89 years old this year and has a very interesting history. Seeing the Casino Theater alone is worth the price of the tour. You will love it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorrieLarryM
50,A Must tour,"Going to a building as part of a get-away may seem counter-intuitive, but do it! The Casino is the iconic symbol of Avalon, and the interior was just as impressive. We took the 40 minute tour which starts with a movie about the Construction of the building, which is quite interesting. The theater itself was ground-breaking in it’s time. Then you move up a series of ramps to the Ballroom. Wow! Be sure to ask about the floor itself. This is truly an amazing construction.Our guide was knowledge, friendly and patient even though he has given the tour thousands of times.the view of Avalon harbor from the outside deck is one you will want to take photos with.Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briangT3877AF

50,Great place to dance,"During the day, the only way to see this stunning ballroom is to take a tour of the casino, which is definitely worth it. However, they also hold periodic events, dances, festivals, etc. The art deco decor is lovely, and the wood floor is beautiful and 10,000 ft.²!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
50,Highlight of my Catalina Trip,"What an amazing tour! When we first arrived to the 'Casino', we did a quick walk around. From the outside, it's a huge building, but you can't even begin to imagine the beauty until you're walking inside. Our tour guide was Frankie from Avalon and he was beyond amazing. Informative, entertaining all with this Hollywood-star charisma. I learned so much about the island, Mr. Wrigley, the history of the Casino, and how to swing dance. My only wish is that I had taken the longer tour- ours was only 45 minutes, and I could have listened to Frankie talk for hours.A must must must experience when on the island.Just a little heads up- there is quite the uphill slope climb once you're inside to see the wonderful ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davinadawson
50,Awesome Anniversary Trip,"The Catalina Jazz Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017. We decided to make it a part of our 20th wedding anniversary weekend.

50,Highlight of our day in Avalon,"We had not been here in 20-years and remembered this building is a ""must see"". The overall beauty, size & capacity of both the ballroom and theater is amazing. We were sorry to find the theater is in need of roof repairs - the locals must miss it as a movie theater. Our guide ""Frankie"" was personable and had abundant knowledge of the building and island. The one thing they should remember to tell you when you purchase tickets (it did not affect our group of 4) is there there are 3 stories of ramps to walk up. This would not be recommended for someone with walking/climbing issues - there is no elevator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1623RNlindah

50,A Step Back In Time,I can remember going to the movies when I was growing up and the huge beautiful curtain would draw back when the movie would begin. Now add a really cool organ player before hand while you enter the building and you wait with anticipation while getting your popcorn and settle in for a first run movie. We were thrilled. Everyone arriving by golf cart to this beautiful historic building on a Saturday evening was a very cool adventure and we had scheduled it into our travel plans for a must do activity. Glad we didn't skip this. It is a must see and we loved it. The bonus was we were there during a great movie that was playing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dbducci
50,Architectural Gem,"We selected the 'Behind the Scenes Tour' as we had never been inside the Casino before. What a beautiful venue, rich in history. Our tour guide was funny and knowledgeable. We were in awe that a venue built in the 1920's was so soundly made with magnificent décor and astounding views. The theatrical tour was impressive and the Ballroom - breathtaking.

When we walked through as part of the tour conducted by ""Frankie of Avalon,"" I could just imagine Benny Goodman's orchestra, or Les Brown's ""band of renown"" playing smooth dance music. Ask for ""Frank of Avalon"" when you book the tour. He'll teach you to swing, and let you solo onstage if you have the nerve. The tables were set for New Year's Eve, dinner and dancing. Wish we could have stayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77

I thought, may be instead of ferry I took a flight and came to Greece, or Italy? Breathtaking view, so familiar from trips to those countries! And promenade, the small cafes and restaurants on it! How about Casino Ball room with the walls covered with the photos of great peoples, who visited the place and have a fun, like You now?! Hotel up to hill, something Cynon...

50,beautiful history,"First, in case you thought different, this is not a place of gambling. This is a lovely art deco theater and dance hall. We took the behind the scenes tour - 70 minutes. So glad we did. If you are going to take one of the tours, take this one. We were told there are so many stories to tell, each tour guide will always have something else to tell you. We did not realize there would be so much history of the area. Another note, one of the guides was part of the history in that as a child he would dive for coins from the cruise ship passengers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbg2020

50,Great and different tour,"The behind the scenes tour is very unique and well worth the time and money. Paul was our tour guide and did an excellent job of making us feel like we were part of the cast preparing for a performance. We were taken into the green room to prepare for a performance and then taken on stage and given the experience of having the curtain raised and being presented to the audience as the organ was playing and the stage lights were on. We then saw Mr. Wrigley's private viewing room, the projection room and were taken to the Grand Ballroom. This ballroom was used in the 1920's to entertain those who came over from the mainland on steamers to party. Today it is still used in a similar fashion with several special occasion events are held throughout the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672kayes

50,A MUST TOUR!,"We almost skipped this, so glad we didn't!(It's NOT a gambling hall, but a historic building with a fascinating celebrity past)We opted for the 40 minute general tour. We had a little over an hour to kill before the next showing so we continued walking to the Beach Club around the corner. Great place to get a drink or meal on the beach and people watch :) However back at THE CASINO.. Rebecca the guide was AMAZING! She is clearly very passionate and full of interesting bits! First you enter the theater.. Very HEAVY with old energy, slightly feels haunted but in a good way. Beautiful murals all over. The ballroom is just as fascinating, you can literally see in your minds eye all the people of the past gliding around the floor. Breathtaking views, and a few moments to take pictures on the balcony. Rebecca was almost like an apparition- If you've seen the original American Horror Story show you'll understand, you feel like she's going to be there in another hundred years giving her tours no one the wiser that she was a ghost all along! Rebecca take that as a compliment, you are beautiful and have great talent!Side note- the theater plays movies every evening? changes on Fridays I think she said. The Secret Life of Pets was the current one, so good family idea.., there is also a more informative ""behind the scenes tour"" will probably do that on our next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodieakgal
50,Beautiful,"We took the ""Behind the Scene"" tour and got to go inside the Ballroom. WOW, it's beautiful! I would love to come back sometime when an event is going on. Joe was our tour guide, he was awesome and had plenty of information to share with us.This was my favorite part of the tour.They only take a small group(12-14 people) on this tour so get your tickets early as they sell out fast and only offer a few tours a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylW845

40,Great Architecture and History on Avalon,I never knew about Catalina Island until the ship stopped there on a recent cruise excursion. The town is called Avalon and it served as a resort area for Hollywood types back in the day.

50,Casino Tour and Movie night,The casino tour is reasonable and shows you both the theater and ballroom. Also you'll see a short video on the construction of the casino. Also suggest seeing a movie in the 1200 seated theater. It is beautifully renovated and quite a treat. I think movies are Friday night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spiritfuleyes
20,Great building Poor tour,We took the Discover the Casino tour with Rebecca as our tour guide. When we bought our tickets the lady told us NOT to take Behind the Scenes. Instead of talking about the history of the building Rebecca told us 6 times how we needed to take the Behind the Scenes and that she didn't have enough time to tell us everything. But if she would have just gave a normal tour it would have been fine. I didn't go on the tour to listen to her repeat herself.You should go see it but make sure you don't have Rebecca!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BandiB_13
40,Nice place to visit,There is a tour they offer for you to re-visit the history of the Casino. The tour does cost. They also have movies that show in the really ornate theater sometimes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gumshoe2000
50,Avalon Ball,My wife and I just returned from the Avalon Ball in Catalina Island. The Casino Ballroom is the location for this classic styled event featuring music and dance from the good old days of long ago. Everyone's dressed in their gowns and tuxedos trying to bring back a little taste of a time we only see in movies. We are a romantic couple who have spent our leisure time seeking the feel and flavor of this period in history. All of us who attended this event should be proud of our success in bringing back exactly what we love and enjoy. She was the princess and I was CinderFELLA. How lucky I am that she always finds MY shoe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicCouple
40,it's not a casino in the sense,Great tour and fun to add on your trip. We did the behind scenes tour and enjoyed the information and facts about the ballroom. Interesting to know ships would come packed and then leave when they were done dancing back to the mainland early morning.

50,Step back in time,"We stumbled into this one, noticing a short line at the box office, we joined a tour of the Casino / Ballroom. The building is unique and the history quite interesting.So the next time you are in Avalon, take a chance on this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retiredgenman
50,Catina Casino Discover the Casino Tour,"Surprize that the Catina Casino is not a gambling casino at all, but the name for a big ballroom many years ago. Beautiful old ballroom down stairs is a nice museum. Enjoyed the tour and the tile works around the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Travelers77
50,Got to visit,This is on place you got to see! Such history in side. The color and charm is worth seeing.We have been before but it was fun to see once more.The theater is awesome The ball room at the top is hard to describe!.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryjfm

40,same as the other site for the Casino,"paid our money enjoyed the folks and saw a short video. Looks to be about a $24 attraction for two folks, but there are discounts available if you know where to look. We did not",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpearsTx
50,Beautiful Setting - Smooth Jazz 2015,"Went to Catalina for the Smooth Jazz Festival and the concerts are held in the ballroom. For the ladies attending, it is quite a walk to the ballroom from any of the hotels, so if you're going to wear high heels, take flats for the walk to the ballroom, then change to your heels. The ramps that lead up to the main floor are steep, so again you need to wear your flats, then change when you arrive to the ball room, or your feet will be in a lot of pain. Remember, you were warned!The ballroom itself is a deco dream, the tiles on the outside are incredible and the interior veranda that encircles the balls room has massive ceilings and ornately decorated. It is a blast to see a show at this venture. The bar is fully stocked and there is ample seating for a show. Restrooms are clean and there are several stalls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InTheKnow22
40,Historic and beautiful. Just go take a look.,"Wonderful mosaic murals around the perimeter. A great walk to get a little exercise. We weren't there when they were having a concert, but many are scheduled. Just a cool place to be. Imagine it back when movie stars and gangster were her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rdqueen
50,Ballroom,This was part of the walking tour of the casino. The ballroom was twelve stories high. We walked up ramps because the elevator was 100? years old,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2118GXjoanneb
40,Interesting Place to Visit,I wasn't sure what to expect because I didn't know the history of the island. This was the first place we visited and they did a great job of explaining the island heritage. The pictures inside the Casino gave you a real glimpse into the venue. Apparently Snopp Dogg recorded a jam session their this past summer that will be on the Super Bowl. Our tour guide was awesome and very enthusiastic about the venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel-quiz
40,Lovely building,We attended the jazz festival here. Great venue. I especially enjoyed the easy access to the exterior balconies. Wonderful harbor views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jscof
50,Catalina Islands Jazz Fest,This year was the 10th time my wife and I have attended the October JazzTrax Jazz Festival.

40,Worth the visit.,"Beautiful views and art deco everywhere. You walk up ramps to get to the top so may be hard for those who have trouble walking or pushing a wheelchair. Took the short tour but think I would like the behind the scenes tour, If you can avoid going when a cruise ship is in...or late in the day when ship people are heading back I think your tour group will be smaller...Went to the Museum at the bottom and learned some great history about the island,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makoakani

Our tour guide, Rebecca, was extremely informative, interesting, fun, AND has a wonderful singing voice.....who could ask for more?!? This is a woman who very obviously loves her job and, because of that, the tour was positively delightful!

50,Still the most amazing ballroom in the United States,"I have been to several events at the Catalina Island Casino, and every single time I feel like I am time traveling to another era, one of ballroom dances, long dresses, tuxedos, and champagne. The smooth wooden floors beg you to dance on them. The balcony makes you want to light up a cigar and hold a glass of wine while looking at the twinkling half-moon of Avalon Bay. If you can't go to an event, at least take the tour, but then you have to imagine the band of musicians, the long-dressed beautiful ladies, the decorations, and the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosLdelaRosa
50,Avalon Casino Ballroom,The ingenuity that went into building the Casino is amazing! The ballroom can hold 500 dancing couples,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/506RebeccaW
50,Ballroom/Casino Tour,"Rebecca our tour guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the place. I was visiting along with my grandmother who had some trouble walking up the ramps. Rebecca paced the tour to allow my grandmother to keep up and enjoy the tour. The theater was a breathtaking work of art, the artwork on the walls and the architecture was beautiful. The Ballroom on the top floor looked like it has a lot of history associated with it and has the view of of Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3998JKjuang
50,I found their tour interesting and informative!,"If you go to the Catalina Island Casino, do take the tour of the Ballroom! I found it fascinating to hear how they created the dance floor! According to our tour guide, Jetsetters from all over used to yacht in to attend events that were held there. Ah, to be so fortunate! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoforeignlands
50,Santa Catalina Island in General and Land Tours,"The island is very pretty and very touristy. During the day, except for Thursdays and Fridays, cruise ships dock and let their passengers go to the island in tenders, which makes for a very busy island. They usually rent golf cart and zip around as if they were dodge-em cars at an amusement park. advertisements for the island state that one can rent a golf cart to get around especially since cars are not allowed on the island. (however, taxis and other vehicles are there.) The problem with golf cart rental is that they can only be rented for one or a maximum of two hours at $40.00 an hour. My husband and I thought we would be able to rent one for our three night stay but were obviously deceived by the advertisements that did not give full disclosure.There are special rates for taxis for seniors who can buy books of ten rides for $15.00, which is an excellent perk for older people.Since my husband and I are not beach or water sports people, we were there to see the place of several songs and much touted renown. We were in California for other reasons and wanted to go someplace we hadn't already been to. I'm not at all sorry we spent several days there but I would not go back. If you have a choice between driving along the coast on Highway 1 and Catalina, by all means choose Big Sur and stay at Cambria.The beaches are small and there is one right in the canter of town. Descanso Beach is more inviting, I think, for swimmers and sunbathers. The water sports look enticing. However, I can recommend some land tours. The Wrigley Botanic Conservancy with its array of succulents and monument to Mr. Wrigley is worth the time as is a tour of the Casino with its huge theatre and amazing acoustics. The ballroom dance floor which can hold at least a thousand is another fantastic sight at the Casino. There are two tours. We took the longer and more expensive one which was well worth it because you get to see not only the ballroom and theatre but the inner workings of the movie theatre and many other places. Interestingly, both the theatre and the ballroom are still used.hopefully, the new museum being built will be more informative than the current one which gives no information about the early inhabitants of the island and just concentrates on the celebrities who have been there. It takes about a half hour of your time.By all means, take a jeep tour to go through mountains and see bison and get spectacular views of the uninhabited part of the island, the Pacific from 2000 feet up, and the marina. I would recommend the longest tour you have time for. We took a three hour with the Conservancy which was very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/361joand
50,A step back in Time!,"My wife and I have danced on this floor three times. Once with the Art Deco Society and twice with the Avalon Swing Dance Festival. Just the size of the space is amazing. Seeing pictures with literally thousands of dancers on the same floor give one a sense of wonder. Almost everything is exactly the same as when my grandparents danced over on the Great White Steamer, danced all night at the Avalon Casino Ballroom and danced on the Great White Steamer back to the mainland. Benny Goodman's ""Sing, Sing, Sing"", Glen Miller's ""In The Mood"", Tommy Dorsey's ""Opus One"", echoed at this masterpiece of design. When visiting the Ballroom be sure to walk right to the center and look straight up. The centerpiece of the ceiling is a tremendous example of Art Deco design. At night walking out on the deck with the cool salty breezes and the romantic nighttime view of Avalon is enough to sweep anybody back to the 1930's. If you are looking for romance, look for a way to dance at the Avalon Casino Ballroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohart2
20,Wish I Could Enjoy it,"I wish there was an admission fee to view the ballroom without a tour guide. I learned more about the Island and the Casino in my first five minutes on the island than spending 30 minutes on this tour.The tour guide, Rebecca, added no value. She rushed us through every room on the tour and talked more about herself than anything of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffrM1197LF
30,Looking a bit tired but the balcony view is great,"As far as ballroom venues go this one is looking tired and in need of some carpet freshener, but you can't deny its history and engineering genius. I would skip the ballroom and just see the theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigthm
50,Casino Tour,This was the last stop on our Casino tour and let me say it was breathtaking. The sights of Catalina from the circular balcony were amazing. Just being on the dance floor made you feel like you were back in time. It was a trip I will never forget.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mryme

Excellent value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286nancya
50,New Appreciation for Catalina History,"We opted for the ""Behind the Casino Ballroom"" tour and had an absolute AWESOME time! Our tour guide Bridgette, offered information from construction to acoustics to the many stars that had visited the island. It was informative and gorgeous and I'm so glad that my fiancee and I took the time to attend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidFunSize

50,What a huge beautiful ballroom!,"I heard you can have weddings and other events, if planned ahead...Sometime in the 1940's they had a dance event and at one time accommodated 6200 people...Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmakhoul
40,Amazing history,"Take the shorter guided tour for a quick and amazing trip back in time. When you reach the ballroom, I recommend laying down underneath the center of the dancefloor and look up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sudden_De
50,Marvelous,Do not miss the Art Deco style theater and ballroom if you can get a tour. They are building a new historical museum adjacent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110ElizabethA
50,Amazing historical venue,"As a lifelong SoCal resident the Catalina Casino is one of the areas defining monuments culturally, historically, and architecturally. I've been to Catalina many times but had never visited the Casino until recently. I took the 'Behind-the-Scenes tour and also saw a movie later the same night. The façade of the building is a gem with tiled murals representing the sea life of the island. Inside on the ground floor is a 1100 seat theatre which still shows nightly films, some current and some classics. The night I was there they were presenting a special screening of the Lon Chaney silent classic Phantom of the Opera with a full orchestra in the pit. Wonderful acoustics and modern sound and projection. Hand painted fresco murals adorn the walls depicting the history of Catalina and lighting changes simulate sunrise through sunset with small 'starlights' twinkle in the ceiling. The lobby is rich in art deco style and dark wood. Both the theatre and lobby smell like it was just built yesterday. The ballroom is on the upper level and holds about 1400 people. You enter from the real on a raised level with a wrap-around bar and tables and chairs, then you step down to the original wooden floor which can be open for dancing, tables and or chairs depending on what is taking place. An amazing fact I didn't know was there is no air-conditioning or heating. To regulate temperature there are doors which open to an outdoor balcony along both sides from the rear bar/entry up to the stage area in the front. These are glass and can be kept open as well as a giant hidden fan up above the domed ceiling; hidden out of site by the art deco carved lattice-like ceiling and chandelier. Got to see the 'green rooms' men's and women's dressing rooms, projection room, Wm Wrigleys private room, etc... A truly stellar trip back through time and an amazing work of preservation. There is an adjacent museum which is free with a ticket from the tour. The museum is moving to a greatly expanded space either late in 2015 or sometime in 2016. About a relaxing minute from most of downtown Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
50,"""Go Behind the Scenes""",Great tour...a wonderful legacy landmark of the Wrigley family. The behind the scenes tour was the perfect length and the short film shown in the theatre provides history for those who are not aware of how the Wrigley's purchased and shaped the future of Catalina Island. I wish I had known about the organ concerts and the movie showings because I would have planned my visit to the island to include an evening at the movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhpbsf
50,This is an experience!,"If you get a chance, go see a movie the movie theater, the auditorium is amazing. Detail is breathtaking. There even is a huge organ there that still works. Each seat end is colorfully painted. If you get a chance to go to any event in the upper casino like the annual Jazz Festival, you must go! The history is bouncing off the walls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiAnnesInLove
50,Fantastic Behind the Scenes Tour,Our Tour Guide Rebecca was a hoot. This is a great fun tour... and if you love history... and music... and art... you will love this tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpguess
50,Those were the days...,"I'm not much on taking tours, but this place was a treat! Must have been a blast back when Wrigley and company entertained the stars! Well worth the time, as a matter of fact I would take this tour again, just to revisit the things I may have missed. Check out the museum first, then take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goosefarm
50,Historic,The behind the scenes tour is worth the access you get to the whole place. Being in the theater was amazing. Really good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newguyalex
50,Tour,Very impressive. Had no idea the ballroom was so large. Interesting history and worth the tour whether you choose the short or long tour you get an idea of the impressive nature this ballroom must have been in the initial installation. Photos do not do it justice....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808erict
50,Touring the Ballroom,This ballroom was huge and awesome. The floors are beautiful the whole thing is beautiful. Rails separate the dining area from the dance floor. And the deco is outstanding! The ceiling lights and artwork in the center is just beautiful! It leads outside where you can view the city and bay of Avalon from 10 stories up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melban711

50,Amazing history and architecture,We took a behind the scenes tour of the Casino Ballroom. CBS during 1940s use to broadcast big bands from Catalina. We were taken to the private viewing room; camera projection room; ballroom and behind the stage. Casino Ballroom is a must for travellers who love archietecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seymour76
50,Historic blast to the past,"Step back in time to a by gone era, the authentic ""roaring twenties"" has been well preserved for you to enjoy. A great activity for all ages, the tours are interesting and informative. The architecture is unique and unmatched. William Wrigley created an entertainment escape for mainlanders decades ago to be enjoyed and savored for future generations. The ""Great White Steamship"" S.S. Catalina ferried 25 million people for 50 years to this charming romantic town. The Avalon Casino AKA ""gathering place"" is not and has never been used for ""gambling"" as one might normally associate with the term ""casino"". This classy historic building, an architectural masterpiece, has been well preserved and is still stunning for all generations to appreciate and enjoy. The Theater on the main level is unparalleled!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TradingPlacesTravel
50,Best way to see a movie.,"We arrived a little early, there was an organist playing the organ, I think from the 1920's. Glade we were early, just for that and very fun to see a movie in this venue. Worth to go for any movie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3224JBmarkt

50,This isn't any casino you've ever seen,"When they say Casino, most of us think Vegas...Catalina Island Casino ballroom was built in the mid 1920's by the Wrigley, think gum, family as a gathering place, which is what casino means here. Think all over the top Moorish architecture mixed in with Art Deco, you get the ideal. Views of the bay from the top floor are great and very romantic. We didn't get to see the theater which I understand is just fabulous, but having cocktails in the bar, one level below the ballroom before walking up the ramps to the top allowed you to imagine how the rich and famous of LA might have spent many a weekend. It was great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizNDesMoines

50,Beautiful blast from the past,"We went to the Catalina Jazz Trax in the beautiful Art Deco Ballroom in the Casino. I was looking up at the ceiling and at the details on the floors and side walls. It does get a little warm inside, so I got some air outside on the balcony and had a view of the Harbor on one side and Descano Beach on the other side. Spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy026
50,Catalina Icon,"This wonderful building is worth a tour, or attendance at an event or movie. I can't say enough about this fabulous space. There's so much history here; be sure to take one of the guided tours.JazzTrax has been held here for 28+ years and the acoustics in the main ballroom are wonderful. Views in all directions - can't be beat. I can't imagine anyone missing this attraction in Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discerningwon
50,Great live music venue for Catalina Jazz Traxx Festival.,We have been attending this festival for 14 consecutive years on the 3rd weekend of October. The weather has been sunny and clear 95% of our time spent there. The Ballroom is beautiful with views looking out towards Descanso Beach and the main part of town. The Theater below is also maintained beautifully with a museum attached.October is the perfect time to go when the island is considered off season (room rates drop) and the crowds leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtripperpals
50,Awesome,Great photo op of an outstanding location. Well kept and clean. Great place to visit for afternoon meals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catalinawalkers
20,Catalina Jazz Festival,"This is just my opinion regarding this Jazz Festival (as an excellent amateur musician myself and huge concert goer over 30+ years). There are many better Festivals for the Jazz and music enthusiasts.My criticism has to do with over miking of the 3 concerts we attended, causing us to walk out of one of them. This may not be the fault of the sound people either (they get a lot of outside pressure from other folks involved). The acoustics of the ballroom itself is a bit like a train station or gymnasium which adds to the problem. Also the audience (many of whom are eating, drinking and socializing) doesn't shut up when the concert begins, and can add more to the distracting acoustic situation. Of course if you mike it to the max, people can't talk, but that's a poor solution.The current sound situation makes it a deal breaker for us for the present time. They do get some amazing musicians there however - but at times you really can't tell because all you hear is drums, muddled chords, and high pitched riffs only. Ear plugs is not the solution either!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrJR17
50,A beautiful look at the past,"We took the one hour tour of the casino. What a fabulous experience. The Art Deco design throughout is stunning and our guide, Porschia, whose art work can be seen throughout the island, took us everywhere behind the scenes, and filled us in on the fascinating history of this historic building. They only give the one hour tour twice a day and it is definitely worth the time and the expense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/innfan2013
40,Can you hear the 40's and 50' big band?,A really lovely ballroom where the ghosts of Big Band can still be heard faintly in the air. It's a lovely setting and I can only imagine the fine music and dancing of the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,Jazz Concerts,Room is huge. Ramp you have to walk up to get to it is no joke! Good thing they have hand rail. Had a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliAngel619
50,Trip to the Good Ole Days,"When you see the ballroom with its massive Tiffany chandelier, you are instantly transported back to the days of glamour. We definitely want to plan to attend one of Catalina’s big events, like their jazz festival. The hardwood floors are glorious and one can imagine dancing the night away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StarLady99
50,Catalina Island Casino Ballroom a Great Tour,"I went on this great little tour of the Avalon Casino Ballroom, Avalon Bay, Catalina Island. It was led by Portia, who besides being a great singer and piano player is pretty as well. She led the group to sing the Avalon song, which she said was sung by the guests before each event back in the day.Anyway, I went on the tour by myself, but it's great for people who like nostalgia, to see how things were back when Art Deco and big productions were the norm. It's about a hour long, but Portia will stay a bit after if one wants to take pictures of the interior of the domed theater on the first level.The Casino, was a gathering place for the community, not a place for gambling and featured a round ballroom on the top, a second level with a few bars and restrooms and the first level domed theater. It has many beautiful vibrant murals painted in the theater and a awesome Tiffany lamp in the ballroom. I recommend this tour for all, except those with small children who might get board with this type of tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131timl
50,A ballroom dancer's dream,Had the privilege of attending a ball and dancing on that wonderful circular dance floor eight floors up. Very smooth floor with no obstructions and the decor is amazing. Kudos to those who maintain it and the building which is the crown jewel of the island. A movie theater and a museum are on the lower levels. People should do their homework before going since there is no gambling in this casino which means a building used for social amusement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geeann_13
40,Another impressive part of the Casino tour,"Just to think, you can rent the joint for just 10 grand a night! It's hard to believe the floor is suspended. You can just picture the upper-crusters (and the high school basketball team) that populated this place in years gone by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Consumerguy1
50,Great Weekend Getaway,"If you're looking for a nice getaway, Catalina just might be a good option. You can pretty much do it all in a day or two, or just hangout by the pool or Descanso Beach. If you rent a golf cart for two hours, you can drive twice around the area and still have time to stop and smell the roses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296denisep
50,Catalina Island mini tour,"Portia was my guide - she was both informative and entertaining . The tour was full of nostalgic details of the casino, the theatre and concluded in the Ballroom, complete with a walk on the balcony - spectacular view. While we were walking up several ramps, I was able to take a lot of pictures of the beach out open windows along the way. At one point the guide congratulated is for climbing the equivalent of 8 flight of stairs! Then we climbred some more! The room, ambiance and chandeliers were exquisite. It was easy to imagine people dancing in the early eras. Well worth going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelLadyK
50,Historic Gem,If you like history and a bit of Hollywood glamour take the tour. We took the mini tour for $10.00 each and it was just the right amount of time. Afterward our ticket got us a discount for the museum which was informative as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melissa_musgrove
10,What?,"As I entered the front doors to what was described as the ""Casino"" I was greeted by a less than happy to see me employee who told me that the building was only open 3 hours per day and that if I came back the next day, I could pay $10 or $25 dollars to take one of the three guided tours. Other than that, I could pay to sit and watch a movie. No thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggnickelimages
50,lets dance,The cushioned dance floor is amazing! I danced here as a kid to the big band Russ Morgan. I recommend taking the Casino back stage tour. The ceiling Tiffany chandeliers are beaufiul too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougrh
50,OMG is it beautiful,"We went there to dance, and dance we did. The room is magnificent and they views are stunning. The food quality is excellent as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailmedic
50,A must see for $25,"You have a 90 min. guided walking tour behind the stage and into the viewing room and dressing rooms. Then you go up ramps to the most beautiful round (largest in the world) dance floor. You can rent this for a reasonable fee, if you have 100 friends. Definitely worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707donnag707
40,Visited for New Years Eve Ball,Liked the venue but the food was only fair and the waiter was rude. The event is quite pricey. Nice one time event but not something I would repeat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndiMom
50,beautiful place,This place is in the casino also...on the upper level. Pretty nice interesting things told by the guide. I would recommend to take Behind the Scens of casino tour. It will cover all casino there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COOLDUDE0110
20,Boring,"This ""Casino"" is an old casino building with nothing to see. Find a picture and look at it, you will be happier that you did not waste your time travelling to see this sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickeyH158
50,MUST SEE,"I have been going to Catalina since I was a teenager so well over 30 years with family, friends and for the Jazz fest, but I had never taken the time to do the Casino tour! Boy was I missing out. I can't wait to see it again the beauty and history is just so amazing! It was a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ginger6_67
30,Back in time,the Casino is the central point of Catalina Island. We had a half hour tour to see the ballroom which is really beautiful but they are all covered because of the Jazz Traxx. As we were going through the building it is like you are back in time because you will see the glorious past of this so called casino (those days casino means a gathering place 1929). The only casino where there is no gambling. I would recommend this place for a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emeraldprincess
50,Beautiful!,"The ballroom in the Casino is absolutely beautiful. The sad part about it though, during the Jazz Trax, they seemed to be more concerned about money & security, that there isn't a place to dance on such a beautiful dance floor. When I first went years ago, it was set up like it would have been in the 20's & 30's with tables to sit at and an area in the front to dance. Now it's all rows of chairs, no dancing, and if you do at your seat, security runs over & tells you to sit down. It's no wonder they are cutting back to 2 weekends next year instead of 3, many of those chairs were empty. If you are there, you must see the theater too, or take a tour, it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937pama
50,Beautiful!!!,My mother and I actually attended Jazztrax for the first time this year on Catalina Island. The ballroom was spectacular! The ceiling in itself was simply beautiful. The view from the balcony was breath taking. I'm certainly going back to visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamHTX
50,Beautiful room,"Very beautiful room, with an outdoor balcony around the exterior with excellent views.We attended Jazztrax here. The food and wine list was very substandard and the service uneven, but I'm not sure if that is the festival or venue's fault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB1114
50,Tour,Fascinating but a lot of uphill walking. The theater is amazing and the ballroom has terrific views from 10 stories up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puffdink
50,Magnificient art deco building,"Absolutely beautiful art deco building called The Casino. No, there is no gambling, casino means ""a gathering place"" in Italian and that is what this building is. A theatre is downstairs with unbelievable decor and decoration, while a huge ball room is on the upper floor. If you get a chance, take one of the tours of the building. Everyone is impressed with it and the tour guide did a fantastic job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLHbigfoot
30,Access to the Casino's Ballroom,Step ramps to get to the Ballroom. A Power chair with four wheels and a pusher if you have a manual chair is recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NWheelchairTraveler
40,Family wedding,The room was beautiful and large. Great place for a wedding reception...although you have to climb up many ramps to get to the top! Could have had more experienced and more bartenders for such a large group.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386cindys
50,Catalina Casino Behind The Scenes,"My name is Evelyn Cano and I have been living on Catalina Island for 22 Yrs. I had never been on the Casino Behind the Scenes Tour, untill today 09/12/2013...Our Tour Guide was Rebecka...Wow!!!! I was so supprised to come to find out and learn the history of the Famous Casino which is an amazing tour. Rebecka did a wonderful job and I can see how much she enjoys working in what she likes. Where you will get the best service is where you find the people that work in what they like and they like wat they do. She was great!!!.. There is so much information you get and so many things to see I never knew the Casino was 12 Floors who would have thought that well I recomend this tour to anyone that would like to learn and see what the Famous Casino is all about..thank you Rebecka for a great tour...Evelyn Cano",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenL279
20,Last tour at 2:15pm during last week of August?? Really??,"We were very disappointed during our ""day trip"" to Avalon on Catalina Island on Wed., 8/28/13. Having taken the 10:00am Catalina Express over from Long Beach, we expected to spend to enjoy lunch then do a couple of tours, including the Casino, and some walking around, gallery visits and shopping. There are 2 tours available at the Casino, one for $10 (basic tour to enjoy the art deco styling, etc.) and one for $25 (""behind-the-scenes"" tour -- not sure what could be very ""behind the scenes"" considering the use of the Casino today, so didn't expect it to be worth $25). Our group of 4 was going to do the basic tour after having done lunch and a city tour earlier and spending some time ""walking the town"". We expected to do a late afternoon tour, arriving at the Casino around 3:15 to purchase tickets for the next available tour. To our surprise, the last basic tour started at 2:15pm -- the last tour? Really?? Who stops tours in the early afternoon, especially the week leading up to Labor Day weekend? There was a $25 tour later, but the last of that type started at 3:00pm?? We were very disappointed, especially after learning earlier that the two restaurants at which we'd hope to have lunch both closed at 1:00pm! It lead us to the conclusion that the island folks aren't really thinking of tourists visiting, but apparently like to close in the early afternoon for a little ""siesta"" before the night life begins later in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sittingonready
50,Love this piece of history,The 30 min. tour is great and give you a glimpse on history of this building and Catalina. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Catalina for the first time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CloeyLosAngeles_CA
10,What a waste of a iconic structure,Don't see the value of how it is currently being used. Seems like there could be a better everyday use for this besides tours and a movie theater. How about some sort of Musical Theater throughout the summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435knicks
50,Wow,Our tour was really better than I thought. My mom said you really should do it. So we took the last tour on a Saturday and they were setting up for a wedding reception. Our guide Rebecca was very informed on all the details and history. I really did love it and getting to see the ballroom all ready for the bride and groom made it a even more special. Now both of my daughters want to have their reception there. THANKS REBECCA LOL♥,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1discomom
50,Must see,We took the walk with a guide. It was very interesting to hear the history of the Casino. The ballroom is spectacular and is still being used for events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stacyg251
50,USC Band Plays July 4th,There are plaques in the Casino Museum for the iconic big bands that played the Casino Ballroom. It is time they added the USC Trojan Band to the list,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrederickBurg
40,Not really a casino,"We did the museum and tour. Not sorry we did. The place is amazing from the walnut panels, to mosaic tiles, to art deco decor. I could only imagine how fabulous it was to attend a dance here in the era of the big band. What a facinating place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nwadlou
50,WOW!,"The is one of the most beautiful building in Southern California. Check out the art work everywhere. The views from the ballroom are unforgettable. Remember, Casino means ""gathering place"". It is not a gambling place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannes32
40,Loved the view from the second floor,The tour is very informative. Lots of history. The art on the inside walls of the theater is very nice. There's a little museum on the side that also runs and informative video. It's a must do if visiting Catalina Island. We really liked the overall experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aztkdiva
50,A must see!,"If this will be your first visit to Catalina, a tour of the Casino is a must! Also, take the longer behind the scenes tour, it is well worth the extra few dollars. A very historic and beautiful building inside and out, you will see all of the hidden rooms and learn about all of the great people who visited there and more. I can't recommend this tour highly enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZToolman
50,Magnificent place to dance,This may be the best ballroom in the United States. Certainly it has the most spectacular setting. It's a must-try if you swing dance or do any kind of vintage dance. There are several events here that take advantage of the ballroom; that's the time to come to Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieH103
50,Casino Tour,"Beautiful example of Art Deco period decorations. Amazing theater and fantastic Ballroom. Wonderful woodwork, chandeliers, Frescoes and overall aesthetics. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charmem
50,A Must See!,We took the behind the scenes tour and it was absolutely breath takingly beautiful. I wanted to dance across the ballroom but my husband does not know swing....we must fix that. You need to see this history it is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckiC724
50,Absolute history before your eyes.,As a fan of the music from the 3o's I could almost hear the bands playing. Made us want to dance. Well worth the time and to understand the history of the building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texbentley
50,More than meets the eye,Fascinating look at the history and architecture. Well worth it at the special price we paid. Regular price is a bit steep but the place is so neat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitzy82_13
50,Classic Beauty,The Catalina Casino is a landmark that most tourists would say identifies Avalon Bay. I'm so glad that it has been well kept for younger generations to come and enjoy the history that makes it an intriguing tourist attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trip2ship
50,So Beautiful,This whole building is one of the wonders of California. Take the tour so you can see the whole thing and hear the history behind it's creation. It's a marvel. I would LOVE to come back for one of the Dances in the Ballroom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YAYASister70128
20,Amazing Casino- BUT Way Too rush in the Tour.,"Amazing Casino- BUT we had same experience as previous reviewer on Feb 27th. It started at 2p and ended at 224- that included short talk up front, in theater, hike all the way to the top, and then few minutes out on balcony. Second girl running tour was rude as she wouldnt let us even stop and look at pictures along hallways. She told us that pictures were also down in museum and that we needed to go pay to look at them there- and it was $3 to get in with the ticket stub.Self guided would be better as the ballroom and theater are spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radsnowgirl
20,Not worth the tour - spend your money on something else,"We took the ""40 minute"" casino tour for $ 10.00 per person. Tour guide RUSHED through the tour and barely/inadequately covered the information that was interesting (e.g., history of the casino). She said nothing about the big bands that had once played at the casino. Her delivery was monotone and boring (sounded like a recorded speech with no soul). I could have done much better as I already had read up on the history of the casino and on the important facts. We were restricted from doing anything other than just follow the tour guide. Took some beautiful photos of the place. Views of the bay from the casino are stunning. The casino itself is truly beautiful and well worth seeing. BUT you can only see it with a tour guide (no self directed tours). Finally, the tour was advertised as being 40 minutes long. It did not last more than 30 minutes. Of those 30 minutes, 7-8 minutes were spent outside of the casino building standing around by the front gate while the guide gave a speech about some of the early days of the casino. I would love to take a self-directed tour of the place. However, a tour guide run tour? Forget it. Not worth the $ 10.00 spent per person. It is a rip-off",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Saul
40,Take the time to see,This place host a lot of functions and is just fun to think how old it is. All over Catalina island you will see the old tile and art deco but this place has it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrangecountyTraveler
50,The View from the Top,"This building is just beautiful. The Art Deco murals alone are worth the stop, but take the indoor tour and in spite of the steep ramp to the Ballroom at the top is worth the difficult climb. If you can, stay for the movie that runs at 7:30 every evening. If you are staying in town, the walk back from the theater will be quite pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCSZ41
40,Catalina Island Museum,Located in the Casino - very small - only takes about 1/2 hour to see the whole thing. Very small giftshop. Interesting video plays continuously with famous island visitors and events on the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindylu52
40,Beautiful building,We took the quick inexpensive tour and were able to see the theatre and ballroom. Both have beautiful art deco decor and it was a fun little tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacarandaSpirit
50,Iconic,"What an amazing facility! Loved the opportunity to be backstage and see the original workings of the theatre--original projectors, the stage area, the Wrigleys private area, etc. The theatre itself is just such a treat--and it is so well maintained. The ballroom upstairs is fantastic. I wish we had been allowed more time to take pictures outside on the balcony surrounding it. That was my only complaint--we were kind of rushed when we went outside, and the views from there were great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandiW27
40,History,This is a very impressive building built in the 20's and is an iconic landmark for the island and the city of Avalon...There is a movie theater inside and tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
50,Take the tour,"The tour is worthwhile - interesting in how fast it was built, the wonderful dance floor and the fascinating history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rollngoers
50,Best Hidden Secret - the Ballroom,"The art deco original auditorium was incredible! The outside was perfected with paintings, mosaics and there was even a museum that you do not want to miss under the Casino area to the right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powersusa
50,"Awesome ""Casino"" tour with Joe who knows it all!","I couldn't wait to visit the ""casino"" (nothing to do with gambling BTW) and I was not let down. The place is SO beautiful and its history and architecture are really fascinating. I was amazed at the vast amount of information provided us by JOE - an excellent tour guide who really knows his stuff. This was a pleasure, and for me was the highlight of our day in Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MIppyR
40,Gorgeous wedding setting,"Beautiful setting for a wedding. Delicious food. Great views. Love the history. However, room was very cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseG962
50,"Must see destination, under an hour.",The ballroom and theater are amazing examples of architecture of the day (1929). The view from the ballroom is spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgeandsheryl
50,Absolutely beautiful!,"We took a Behind The Scenes Casino Tour which included the theatre and the ballroom. Our guide, Joe, was very knowledgeable about the history of the casino and the island. We learned a lot and were overwhelmed at the beauty of the place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB262
50,"""Discover the Casino"" tour by California Expeditions","My husband, 7 year old daughter and I recently took the ""Discover the Casino"" tour offered by California Expeditions. It is something every visitor to Catalina should do. Porschia was an excellent guide (and singer, as it happens!) sharing the colorful history of this beautiful Art Deco landmark and major venue of the Big Band era. After the tour, I happened to mentioned to her that we missed not making a special request for the theatre organist when we had the opportunity, and she offered us a very special treat--If he was still available, he might be able to play for us. He was there, and he graciously treated us to a wonderful rendition of ""Heaven"" (Dancing Cheek to Cheek). The enchanting sound of the pipe organ in such a beautiful setting will be remebered forever! It was a fantastic topper to a great stay in Catalina. Thanks again to Porschia & organist, Mr. John Tusak! Admission to the Catalina Island Museum is included in this tour and does a wonderful job setting the scene and sketching out the players in the island's early days as a tourist destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbyP132
50,Must See,"Took a 45 minute tour of the Casino Ballroom, totally worth it. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and this historic monument is grand! So glad we made the decision to check it out. Now the picuture of this place has much more meaning to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/506ChristineH
40,Beautiful time in Avalon!,"Beautiful ballroom, truly amazing history. My sister and her husband were making their first visit there and really were impressed. Someone had told them it was kind of ""cheesy"" and they thought it was anything but. They loved the Art Deco and old fashioned feel which they thought was very genuine. Some of the tours were not in operation because we're there mid week in Nov but they loved it anyway and want to go back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhebaB
50,Well worth a visit,This was a blast from the past. Our tour guide was terrific and gave an excellent presentation. The ballroom was beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderer31310
50,Love the Casino,"This building is well worth the tour. It is spectacular. The theatre is wonderful, one of those twenties greats. And the ballroom is incomparable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABAIII
30,Relatively interesting,"The theater in the casino building is beautiful and is the highlight of the tour. We watched a movie and enjoyed being in such a beautiful theater. Took the tour to see the ballroom as there was no access without a tour. The tour guide was nice and informative. We found out more about the theater on the tour. The ballroom was not that fascinating. If you have time, check it out. If you can't make a tour of the ballroom, watch and movie at the theater and look at a photo of the ballroom online. The ballroom pales in comparison to the beauty of the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel207Chicago
50,Take the Casino Tour,"I've taken the Casino tour twice now and loved it each time. The ballroom and theater are gorgeous and the history is fascinating. Emily was our guide. I was surprised to hear she graduated in the theater only 2 years ago, but she was a wealth of knowledge and represented the tour operators well. Ladies, leave your heels at home and wear some comfy shoes so you can enjoy your tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraho_12
50,Gorgeous Art Deco!,Learning that the word Casino does not mean gambling. Casino means gathering place in Italian. The theater and ballroom are stunning!!! The Art Deco murals were done in 1929. They are so beautiful! A must see on your travels to Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiTomB
50,Art Deco masterpiece,"The ballroom and theatre are beautiful Art Deco. Well worth the tour! Casino means meeting place not gambling. They show movies in the theatre, the first theatre built for sound movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beverlz
50,Great for short vacation,"This small island is great for 1-2 days short honeymoon or anniversary and lot of family attractions too , very good restaurants , go one time and you love this quiet island",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrungT784
50,Casino,Very nice and interesting place with a lot of history. The grounds were well kept and the staff was Dry helpful and willing to answer any questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mfog715
50,Beautiful building,The museum was very informative. We especially enjoyed the video or the Catalina Island History. We were impressed that the building was built in such a short amount of time. The theater with the star twinkle lights was exquisite. The ballroom was grand and our tour guide very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681SusanL
50,Tour,We had a wonderful tour of the casino theater and the grand ballroom. Very informative guide. Would lve to attend an event there. The Jazz festial was there when we were.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetm866

40,Interesting to See....Once,"The Catalina Ballroom is the island's biggest attraction. It sits in the Avalon harbor and begs visitors with its round facade. Yes, it's beautiful. Yes, the tile mosaic of the naked mermaid is iconic. Yes, it's a monument to a time gone by. Yes, you only need to see it once, and really, the tour should have been 15 minutes...at the most. Catalina was, apparently, the place to go on a weekend mini-break back in the 1930's and 40's for Hollywood celebs and non-famous hipsters, but now the island is a party place for oldsters in their boats who call it ""The Island."" I call it ""The Most Boring Place I Can Imagine,"" but you can decide for yourself. The gift shop at The Casino is nice. They have great postcards and such with retro, art deco designs, and beautiful tile magnets emulating the ""Catalina"" tile look. Definitely visit since you're there and will virtually have nothing else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_Kenobi
40,"If you love Art Deco, don't miss this!","Who knew that a Wrigley chewing gum magnate spend lavish amounts of money on a remarkable entertainment venue on an island? I sure didn't. Built in 1929, this is an amazing piece of architecture and it is so well preserved its like stepping into a time capsule. Gorgeous woodwork and designs adorn the interior and its a must-see for fans of Art Deco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kurtsterr
40,Casino visit,didn't do a real detailed visit but we will next time. We heard light jazz on a sunny afternoon having drinks in the warm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolM
40,Don't miss,"Amazing if you like Art Deco, deco tile and art. Be sure to visit ball room largest in the world completely restored",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveA692
40,Gorgeous place with great acoustics,"We attended Jazztrax here and the acoustics were great. We had a great view from a table on the second level. The first night, the service was very slow, but on subsequent nights, it was great. There are many ramps to climb to get to the ballroom so not for the faint-of-heart. Great piece of history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islasisterchick
50,Iconic building must also be seen from the inside.,"A visit to Catalina will not be complete until you have seen the inside of the Casino.It is one of the reasons the island attracted the celebrities it used to. The building was and still is the primary marketing reason one would come to Catalina, to enjoy the resort and dance the night away in a glorious decor of glamour.The art deco style of the wall and ceiling paintings has a maritime theme that is just right for Catalina. There is none of the baroque excess of the European style. But the mahogany wood panels and the deep red of the carpet and seats exudes a sense of supreme luxury and splendor.Add to the design an excellent detail for acoustics and it is hard to find a better architectural equal for its days. If you are used to today's multiplex theaters, the Casino will make you long for the days when beauty was beauty and glamour was not debasedinto suburban junk.Go see for yourself and demand more from today's dull, Lego-block architects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lapster2011
50,AVALON CASINO BALLROOM,brian culbertson and jullian vaughn concert was excellent. held in the historic ballroom the venue has exquisite sound and beauty wrapped in an oceanfront setting. it may have also helped that i had front row vip seating but really there is not a bad seat in the place.the chairs are comfortable and lighting great. i highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaLaBone
50,Great tour,We took the short $10 tour of the Casino Ballroom & Theater and just loved it. The theater is unbelieveably beautiful and interesting. The ballroom was historical & the views of the harbor great. I want to return & see a movie/ listen to the organ one day. The museum that is attached to the Casino was very interesting too. The walk to the ballroom is a little steep but we all made it. The tour guide was hilarious. I wish they had a tour that was a little longer so you could actually walk around and look at the theater more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravGal23
50,Beautiful old ballroom,"We saw Big Bad Voodoo Daddy at the Avalon Ballroom as part of a Jazz Festival. So much history, lots of old pictures and posters from earlier eras and apparently even a ""ghost"" who frequents the ballroom on occasion. The lighting and decor was stunning and the band was the best as always.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spikeandchopper
40,Must do,Disappointed that we didn't get to hear the pipe organ. Enjoyed the tour and the museum. Excellent tour guide. Beautiful view from the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssilva50
40,amazing venue,"Liked the gorgeous views, disliked the terrible sound system. Attended a weekend of jazz concerts and needed to use ear plugs as it was amped too loud and despite complaints the majority of the artists music was distorted and not presented as it should have been. The ""cheap"" seats at $189.25 had people packed in tighter than an airplane, but at least in an airplane you have an armrest and cool air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB992
50,Catalina Island Casino Ballroom and Theatre Tour,"We accidentally discovered the tour on this, our first visit to the island. Our tour guide, Chuck, age 65, he said, was raised on the island during a good part of the Casino's heyday. He has since retired as a guide but is active elsewhere on the island. We tell everyone this tour is a 'must do'. The history of the place and the engineering marvel that it is, given 1928 technology, is flatly amazing. First thing we learned is that it was never a gambling hall or parlor. 'Casino' means a place to gather for a good time. The structure marries a huge, beautiful theater downstairs with a huge beautiful dance floor upstairs. The docents know their stuff and you will walk away astounded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryw74
50,Unbelievably beautiful,This gorgeous art deco building has much of its original charm intact. The building itself and its colorful history were so interesting that we took two tours and then went to a movie there! It's a must for anyone visiting Catalina!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaBElPaso
50,Catalina Casino tour,We went on the Casio Back Stage Tour. It lasted 1 1/2 hours and you learned a great deal about what the word Casio means and how it applied to the Casio built by Wrigley in the early 1900s. The building was almost all original. I took video of the entire tour. It was permitted and encouraged. The theatre is still in use as is the 15000 sq ft ballroom. Certainly worth the time and money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonR8700
50,Excellent in every way,"With my wife, saw this beautiful structure and took in a movie. They had the organ player there so that was cool. Art on walls inside theater was better than expected. Movie picture and sound was fine. A+++++",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RespectIsEarned
50,What a Treat!!!,"We did the Behind the Scenes Casino tour and it was awesome! So much history and beauty everywhere! Our tour guide was Kathy and she did a really great job! She answered all of our questions and was very passionate about her job. One of the highlights was getting to see the beautiful pipe organ in the theater. Our group not only got to see it, but we were treated to our own private concert from the man that plays the organ on weekend nights before movies. It was amazing! The ballroom is also very beautiful and so rich with historic details! We highly recommend this tour and hopefully you will be blessed with Kathy for your tour guide!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaB527

50,A true classic.,"Take a tour, see a movie, make reservations for a Catalina casino event ie. New Year's Eve but put it on your bucket list to see. It's a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxycruiser
50,Unique event locale and Catalina icon,"The Casino is the major structure you can see from the approach into Avalon when you first arrive at Catalina. As you discover from the locals (or your vacation guide), the Casino is not a Casino, nor was it ever - it just means ""gathering place"" in Italian. I have been to many events there, most recently the USC Marching Band Fourth of July performance and the Avalon fireworks. It is the premiere entertainment venue, so if anything is happening there while you visit, go ahead and check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craiggerman

50,We toured the museum and the Casino - Theatre and Ballroom. The guide did a wonderful job.,"There is a ramp - sports arena style - that winds up several floors, but with a rest even people who had walking problerms made it. The theatre is so worth seeing and also the Ballroom - I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoLi2269

50,NYE 2011-2012,"We visited the ballroom for NYE 2012. We wanted a nice and formal event but with good music and not overcrowded. At the same time we wanted to find a venue with great quality people. That's exactly what found for NYE at the casino.We are in our late 20's and had a blast! I'll say that out of 400 people, there were only 20 of us in our late 20's to mid 30's everyone else seemed to be in the 50-60+. The food was good (not great), the music was awesome (a jazz band form LA), and ball room was GREAT!A couple tips - it is best to be the last group to eat so you won't feel rushed. Don't be concerned with what side of the ball room or what part of the floor you'll sit. There are all great seats and you won't be able to see the water outside anyway. Lastly, the ballroom is located at the very top of the casino and there are NO elevators.Overall - we would definitely do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EzraN

50,Should be one of the wonders of the world.,"I've live in Avalon for 35 going on 36 years, and have attended hundres of events in the Casino Ballroom, from concerts to Avalon High School basketball games. Every time I walk into this building I am still in awe, especially when you consider that it opened in 1929.If you come to Catalina I highly recomend that you either attend an event or take a tour of the Casino Ballroom. ( years ago when the high school was found to have asbestos in it the Wrigley's allowed them to play there while a new gym was being built ). Every time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billfish55
50,A trip back in time,"Catalina Island is one of my favorite places for a mini-vacation - you take a short boat trip out so you can pretend you're on a real getaway trip - plus the charm and atmosphere out there is terrific - it is older there but they work hard to keep it clean and appealing. While there, the tour of the Casino Building (never a gambling venue) is worth the small fee. You are taken back in time to the late 30s, early 40s, the big band era, when folks would dance the night away on the upper floor ballroom. The tour takes you behind the scenes and you also tour the grand theater on the ground floor, spectacularly preserved, still showing movies today. The maintenance and restoration of the building is a gift to us all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cma1944
40,Worth the $,"When you see the price for a tour, it seems expensive. It is worth it. The ballroom is amazing, and the view from the balcony is nice as well. If you appreciate history and architecture, the tour is worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414MattH
50,Attended the Avalon Ball,The Avalon Ball was incredible! We got to get all dressed up and danced the night away to big band era music! I felt like we had literally stepped back in time. so gorgeous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracidhb
50,Opulence in Avon,"I'd love to go to a huge dance here. 6,000 person ballroom, all open span, no supports except walls. The promenade around the outside is 10 floors up. Wonderful pictures of all of Avalon from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youngerone
30,"Facinates the Baseball Fans, Especially If You're A Cub's Fan","The Catalina Island Casino Ballroom is rich in history. They have walls full of pictures and artifacts of Mr. Wrigley (from Wrigley's Gum). He loved the Chicago Cubs, so the museum showcase pictures of the Cubs at their spring training in Avalon. One of the walls even tells you the history behind the ""Billy The Goat"" curse. The museum is definitely something to experience if you are a baseball fan or love history in general. If you don't really care for those things, I would suggest you skip this activity and go ziplining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunkaymei

50,Best place to Dance in the WORLD,If you get a chance go to Catalina Island and stay several days there (or more) and be sure to plan your stay around one of the fabulous dance nights at the Casino Ballroom. My husband and I absolutely love the dance floor there. WE aren't selling anything or promoting anyone's business there. We just love dancing on that ballroom floor. We also love being in Catalina. Catalina Island is just an hour away from Long beach- yes we take the Catalina Express. We love it! We have stayed at many hotels and places to stay in Avalon- most places you will stay there will be noises from go carts (and some cars) driving by or trash trucks or food delivery trucks or partiers. There are very few places to stay where it is quiet- we know them and won't give up the secrets!!! keeping that for ourselves...Don't forget New Year's eve dance at the ballroom. We can't go this year- husband is fighting cancer. We are hoping for next year for sure- also the Avalon Ball!!! see you there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazingmary

10,Beatlemaniacs,"Went to a concert on Catalina Island at the end of November. It was supposed to be Beatlemania. Instead it was like a cheap club band wearing wannabe beatle costumes. They sounded horrible down to the phony Liverpool accents, let alone the musical inadequacy. It wasn't a rock concert - it was more like a cheap disco. Even the cheap disco lights were cheasy.The island is always cool - been there for vacations, diving, summer fun etc. The venue was ultra cool, always wanted to go inside that big building. But after the cost of the boat ride back and forth, plus $45 tickets - we sure did expect alot more from catalinaconcerts.com.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wbtelly
