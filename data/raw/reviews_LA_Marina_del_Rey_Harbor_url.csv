50,Breathtaking Views,I wish someone had mentioned Marina del Rey before - its stunning to walk around and so pretty at sunset! Heaps of restaurants to choose from too - it as nice just walking around and slowing down compared to Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatchstickLive

40,Pleasant place to walk,"Not a place where you can spend hours but it is a nice walk along the harbor to check out the boats. Its LA so you'll spend 30 minutes driving 3 miles but if you happen to be there, stroll out for a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloften028
30,Beautiful view of the harbor,Our Uber driver dropped us off in front of the Harbor and we traveled down to look at the boats and the water. As out of town guests we really didn't know enough about the area to do any thing but take a stroll along the shore. The weather was warm and there is a nice view of the harbor and the homes across the bay. We were on our way to the park and it was a nice hike but there is a shopping area close by and the park is within 2 miles. The area is clean. We were there to take park in the New Years Eve events at the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmainD_12

It's apparently the biggest marina in the world, so you'll get plenty of exercise if you walk all the way around. Sea lions abound, and sometimes a dolphin or two. Get outside and enjoy it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cello12345
50,Wonderful hotel in beautiful harbour setting,"My wife stayed at the Marina Del Rey for a week while I was away. We were both a little nervous as we had been traveling in California but didn't really know the area. The hotel has recently been refurbished and is in a quiet area in the harbour and it is very well kept. The food is very good and varied and my wife felt comfortable sitting at the table on her own. There is a great Gym, pool and hot tub. All the staff are very friendly and efficient, but I have to single out Nancy on the concierge desk as she made our visit and experience first class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveles07
