40,Massage,I enjoyed my massage here. The sitting room was quiet and peaceful. The staff was very nice and knowledgeable. I was part of the monthly subscription and was able to get an appointment easily.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BucketListChaser

40,Relief!,While visiting West Covina I developed a terrible knot in my upper back and below my neck. I could hardly move and it was very painful. While walking through the mall parking lot I saw this spa. I called to make an appointment for the next day. The therapist worked very hard to ease the knot out. What relief!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nothappy12342015
40,great relaxation,"I've had several massages here and have always had great service regardless of the massage therapist who treated me. I enjoyed the quiet, softly lit rooms with the comfy massage beds and luxuriously soft blankets. The only thing I haven't liked is the strong push to pay for a membership. I can't afford to go every month, no matter how wonderful it is for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntieMmm
