50,Excellent Theraputic Massage,I have really bad neck and shoulder problems and need deep tissue muscle work. I get it here for a price reasonable enough that I can afford to go when I really need to.,Pam B
20,IN A NUTSHELL,"If you are a novice to massage you will probably feel satisfied to have the experience. As a seasoned person of this art - I warn you - have no expectations.No offense meant to the employees, but they all feel very green with only minimal accrued hours of experience required to receive a license. Patiently I tried several different people who ultimately lacked the capability to perform true deep tissue massage. They were nice people and I imagine probably did their best. Regardless, this technique seemed foreign to all. It is doubtful you will find any therapeutic release if you rely on massage for chronic neck or back problems.Why did I ever consider Massage Envy to begin with? Every once in awhile you find a gem in an unexpected place. Who doesn't prefer a local go-to place?True I have not tried out every therapist they have; but I feel confident that I have a good barometer of its limitations.IN A NUTSHELL:If you want a massage for fun - its your kind of place ! If you need professional services - forget it. Overall joke for the serious who require true therapeutic massage.",Byrdie J
