30,Mixed,"A neglected state park. Could be a wonderful get away for locals and stopover for travelers, but seems to lack money for maintenance and supervision. Camped here while traveling through. Very clean bathrooms, but lack of host/ranger meant disregard for rules. Seemingly person living in tent trailer with dogs barking all day and night, ran generator from 4:30 am! Campers using drone, kind of a lawless place.",EmB
50,Nice State Park,"Very good for a day trip and picnic Nothing unpleasant, plenty of parking maybe because it was November.",Claude C
50,Update: Visitor Center Photo,"Just a quick update on my previous review, re: the little nature center / mini-museum which never seemed to be open when we came by. Well we finally got inside and chatted with the ranger, viewed the exhibits - artifacts, rocks, plant matter, etc. (See photo). I love all visitor centers no matter how modest, and this little room may help you enjoy your visit a bit more. They have helpful brochures and pamphlets on hand, and the ranger can provide tips on other sites to see in the area.",SoCalRambler
40,Worth seeing,Its like a small Joshua Tree. Very remote but nice drive. Not as impressive rock formations but plenty of Joshua trees. Camping ant handicap accesible trails.,Mark D
30,A few lovely Joshua trees,"This is a small area with a few picnic tables. The center building was closed. We Joshua trees were nice, but they were rather sparse. It was fun to drive through.",CLC48
30,S'mores and movie night,Our soccer team had a great afternoon/evening at the campgrounds. We didn't stay the night. We ate sm'ores over the campfire and watched a movie that was brought along and projected onto a white signboard at the campground. There was almost no one there while we were. Once the sun goes down it gets really cold and windy. As other reviewers have said this is very primitive campground.,craftywriter
40,Fun half day trip!,"Kids had a good time climbing all the rocks and walking the trail, small visitors center with a few bits of info for the area, fun for a short visit but not a whole lot to do for more then a few hours.",Rob B
40,"Scenic Views, Nature Trail, Picnics and Camping at Saddleback Butte State Park","We went to Saddleback Butte State Park in September. The state park was put in place to protect the butte, which is a granite mountaintop, and is 3,651 feet.We drove the short drive from Lancaster to the state park. It felt so far away, while still being so close to the city.There is a picnic area as well as camping. There is Dowden Nature Trail, which is a half mile walk to see the cactus and the views.There are other areas for hiking as well.In the springtime, desert flowers in this area are beautiful to see. Its also the best time to visit this state park.There is a day use fee. We have an annual state park pass and that is good for the park as well.",mini
10,No access to butte,"When my husband and I went, there was a bumpy dirt access road and fence blocking off the butte. We got horrible lost on the way back. If you go take a four wheel drive and a good map.",JaniceSeagraves
50,Fields of lovely yellow flowers (ground cover).,"Seeing yellow (daisy like) flowers coming out of the sandy soil is amazing. NOT as many due to drought. But... what ever was there, was ""a feast"" for eyes.",Maria L
40,"Small, dusty, desolate and full of life....","The desert is always full of life and beauty.Small park with short trails, picnic tables and campingIncredible views.Dusty, desolate and full of lifeNearby is the Indian Museum and sanctuary church (2 pines for movie buffs)Average and so glad it's here. We need more state/national parks",Summerasalifestyle
50,A perfect beginners hiking trail,"the state park is unmanned or at least that was the case when we went. they ask for a 6 dollar user parking/user fee and self registration for the over night campers. Its a nice quick hike with a pretty tame grade. the last five minutes are the toughest as you approach the small hill that has nice rock formations and offers a nice view of the park. pack a lunch and hang out at one of the picnic benches. they offer some shade from the desert sun. The park isn't way out in the mountains so you still get a decent cell signal. My gf and I managed to watch a few episodes of the Wonder Years on netflix while we ate our post hike lunch. Its a nice park, nice hike, and a great way to spend a saturday morning/early afternoon.",Cesar J
30,Only if you're in the area,"I love the desert and I love Joshua Trees so when I decided to take a day trip up to Saddleback Butte I was pretty excited. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed upon arrival. On the plus side, there are vast views and plenty of joshua trees to look at, and the lovely mountains in the background. But in the end we didn't venture too deep into the park. The trails were not clearly marked, a few of the picnic table areas (which are nicely under cover for those super hot desert days) were roped off with caution tape (a bit of a disconcerting site). We drove in on the dirt road for a short moment and got out to photograph a little of the area, but probably didn't stay more than 45 min in total as it was quite lack luster. It's totally worth it if you're already in the area, but a purposeful drive more than 1 1/2 hours it took us to get there isn't - there are way better places to see the desert in that amount of drive time. On the plus, we decided to take Angeles Crest Hwy back and it was an amazingly beautiful drive!",NikiMustTravel
40,Beautiful panaramas and uncrowded,"This State Park has both day use area $6,and a campground with host $20.(Seniors $18) There is a little visitors center with nice displays of flower, fauna and history of the park. There is a paved, easy1/2 mile path, sandy desert trails, as well as ones up to a little butte and challenging Saddleback Butte. Be sure to wear a hat, sunscreen and take plenty of water!In both the day use and campground areas there are covered ramadas with wind breaks and picnic tables. Flush toilets available in both areas. Group campground area availableThe park seems to never be crowded, night star gazing is great, the very nice Antelope Valley Indian Museum is only a few miles away and is free to campers from the park.",295tammie
50,Open Season,Saddleback Butte State Park is a wonderful place to visit.You can just relax and enjoy the view or you can hike in the hills and really enjoy the country side.,johndisepio
40,Great hike!,"Recently hiked 3 miles in the trail. Had a great time! Hiked the trail with a 10 y/o and 7 y/o without problem. Make sure you take plenty of water. Trail head was difficult to find, directions weren't clearly marked. Make sure you have $6 to pay the user fee, no opportunity for change.",GSD671
50,For the fan of snakes,"Having scoured half of the Mojave Desert trying to see a Mojave Green Rattlesnake, this was the place that delivered. Really easy walks with a good hike if you fancy taking on the peak for an excellent summit view. Ladderback Woodpeckers, Cactus Wren, Horned Lark, and, as long as you are sensible and know how to behave responsibly around rattlesnakes, the Mojave Green is here.",rolf12014
40,A real desert experience,"The Best time to visit may be in the Fall, Winter or Spring months, but Saddleback Butte State Park is an opportunity to experience the desert life...dry, sunny, serene.Numerous trails lead to boulders, buttes and sandy spots.",avidhiker2
40,Hot X infinity!,"This is prime hot hot desert, bring water!Stopped briefly and walked about, well kept park with nice trails in the desert. Clean bathrooms and nice individual picnic shelters to escape some of the sun. Can't imagine this place gets too many daily visitors; we were the only ones there mid-afternoon.Many movies are filmed nearby here.",WelcomeMat
40,Hot!,"My visit was in 2001 but the web site will only allow me to list 2013 visits. I imagine that the state park has changed little since that time. My friend Mike and I were visiting this park in June of that year since we had business in Los Angeles less than 70 miles away and I told him that during the trip I wanted to see the Mojave Desert ecosystem. We saw it! Quirky Joshua trees, some 30 feet tall (watch your head, they have spikes!), plenty of snake burrows, flies and noisy ravens. Saddleback Butte rises from a flat plain which had once been, paradoxically, a river floodplain. Sand partially covered the road into the Park. The trail is about an hour's walk to the Butte but we decided not to chance it on such a hot day. Well worth the visit!",Oldmoviefan
40,desert,if you like the desert this is has a feel of the vastness know as the mojave desert great views ..... take water. very hot in summer (it is the desert ),Gretchen S
30,Desolate landscape,"Very cold in the winter and extremely hot in summer, best time to visit is spring or fall. The whole time we were hiking there we did not see a soul. It is worth it to take a side trip to nearby Devil's Punch Bowl",Betita60
50,Great for active family,"My kids love to climb rocks. This is the best place to do it. The winds are going crazy at this area during winter and early spring, but it is great in summer. It has a trail about an hour and a half walk. Great view of San Bernardino Mountains and Angeles National Forest State Park. There's a BBQ area. Great for weekend getaway!",ArtRussianMom
40,Plan Ahead Before You Go,"Way, way out at the far reaches of Los Angeles County are some eerily fascinating wildlife reserves and parks. Visible from many miles away, Saddleback Butte rises out of the desert floor like a specter; many don't realize this formation is also a state park where one can go hiking, camping or just stroll around in the profound silence of the high desert.Before you go, be sure to check out the official website for important information regarding facilities, conditions and possible closures. This is not a place to go unprepared.If the wind isn't tearing your hair off, you're roasting alive in the heat or merely turning a festive red color in the low humidity. That is to say: The camping is semi-primitive, the landscape bleak and the hiking can end up an exercise in misery and heat syncope. Bring water, people. Hike early.There's a cute little nature trail that circles around the ranger station, which apparently contains some exhibits. I wouldn't know, since it has never been open one single time I've gone. Nearby are some wooden ramadas with picnic tables, which provide a bit of shade and some protection from the wind. You can drive to the actual campground from here, or enter via 170th street (around the corner.)I always tell people to make this one stop on a tour of the Antelope Valley, because there are some other interesting places nearby - the Indian Museum, some empty gas stations and motels that are used exclusively for film sets, as well as some of the aforementioned county wildlife reserves. Just up the hill is a Joshua tree forest so thick and green it rivals anything I ever saw at the national park of the same name. Or, if you're the gritty outdoors type, go ahead and camp there. You just have to love stark vistas and a pronounced feeling of ennui.Here is some of the information from the site. You really *have* to be prepared before you go:""Saddleback Butte, elevation 3,651 feet, is a granite mountaintop that towers some thousand feet above the broad alluvial bottom land of the Antelope Valley about fifteen miles east of Lancaster, on the western edge of the Mojave Desert. The state park surrounding Saddleback Butte was created in 1960 to protect the butte (one of many similar land features in the Antelope Valley) and examples of native Joshua Tree woodlands and other plants and animals that were once common throughout this high desert area.The best time to visit is in the springtime (February through May) when wildflowers are apt to put on a beautiful display of color. Autumn (October and November) is pleasant as well, although temperatures may vary widely and change rather suddenly. Summer temperatures average 95° F and occasionally range as high as 115° F, but evenings are peaceful with warm breezes and clear skies. Average minimum temperature during the winter is 33 ° F (frost and sub-freezing temperatures are common, with occasional snow).HikingThe Little Butte Trail is about 2.5 miles to the peak and can be picked up from below the day-use area, or take the 2-mile Saddleback Butte Peak Trail from the trailhead parking area in the campground. The trails begin on a mild slope through moderately loose sand among creosote bushes and Joshua trees to the base of the butte where they merge. It then becomes a challenging climb up sand and rock, but the finale is worth every step. At the top, enjoy a breathtaking 360° view over the Antelope Valley and east across the Mojave desert. For a nice moderate 3-mile loop, go up one trail to where they merge, come back down on the other, then return on the park's gravel road to the trailhead where you started. See the ""Equestrian"" section for additional trail information. Day-use fee applies.The short self-guided Dic Dowen Nature Trail is located at the Visitor Center in the day-use area, with information on the natural history of the park and area.Day-Use FacilitiesDay-use facilities within the park include 27 picnic sites with tables and barbecue grills, each with ramadas for protection from the sun and wind. Water and pit toilets are located near the picnic area.Visit the park office and visitor center, located at the entrance to the day-use area, featuring displays and hands-on exhibits about the natural and cultural history and geology of the area.Campground FacilitiesThe family campground is first-come, first-served and offers 50 units with tables, stoves, fire rings, and shade ramadas. Potable water spigots and full restrooms with a flush toilet and sink are located throughout the campground (no showers). Eight people maximum per campsite. There is a 30-foot max for campers/RVs. Use of the RV dump station is free for paid campers, or a $6 fee for non-campers. The dump station is currently closed for repairs.""",SoCalRambler
