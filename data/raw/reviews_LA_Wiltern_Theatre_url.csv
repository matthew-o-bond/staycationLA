30,horrible seats,"I know its been here a long time, its kinda historic. I had never been before. it seems to me thay spent a lot of money on the bar areas with drink prices a bit over the top. so glad we went to ralphs a got a bottle of good tequilla, sat in car and has a few shots. we would have had a drink inside to but 12.00 well drinks was aboult the price of a cazadores bottle after tip. but worst of all was my very cramped seat, complete with spring coming through seat cushion. but I really liked the retro feel of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hdbsob
20,Be aware of seating arrangements.,"I bought 2 tickets from Groupon for Moscow Ballets's Great Russian Nutcraker for Dec 22nd at the Wiltern. Our tickets were Floor 4 at a price of $59 each. To our dismay, when we got to the theatre , the seats were not traditional theatre seating. Instead, they were regular chairs on the ground floor( like you see at a restaurants). Our view was completely obstructed by the people in front of us. When purchasing the tickets, it did not indicate the the seats would have partial or obstructed view. We have been to many theatres, including Panteges, which all have standard inclined seating arrangements for proper visibility. I reached out to Groupon for refund and was given a stantard disclaimer that Groupon is not responsible for the quality of seats. And got 20% Groupon buck refund. Wiltern Theatre should not sell these seats. Please be aware if you are planning to purchase tickets at this theatre especially from Groupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaSam1234
10,Seating arrangements or lack thereof!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"So how the theatre can decide that watching a ballet from the knees up is a good situation for any ticket holder is beyond me. I know they will tell me that you purchased the tickets from Live Nation but Wiltern you set up the seats!!! We could not see the floor of the stage while sitting in our high priced seats on the floor as the stage was too high!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are going to accommodate such a show then at least have the professional eye to place the ridiculous ""chairs"" with some consideration for how the patrons will be watching the show or at least have a warning that the view will be obstructed!! ALL other theaters have this warning with their ticket sales. This entire section could not see the Nutcracker Ballet properly and I am sure they paid just as much as we did and it's disgusting to feel taken advantage of. I would never attend any show at this theatre for this reason. I do not expect to hear back from anyone or get any satisfaction - but I feel it necessary to review this poor and unprofessional service to warn others!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loracre
50,Madonna Madam X,"Madonna gave it her all and didn’t feel the audience were because she asked ‘is that all you’ve got’. She must have heard my emphatic yes, because she had her microphone pointed at the audience most of whom were in stunned silence by the presence of Madam X, looking refined and in command of her audience and here on stage entourage. Warning the audience that they were in for along show, Madam X asked the audience to be seated. I hope she enjoyed the standing ovation and she hasn’t become climatized to adoration of her fans many of whom were from the next generation.The Wiltern seats less than two thousand, and Madonna was perfectly in control. Championing being an Artist, and performing songs inspired from her days as a ‘soccer mum’, you won’t have heard them if you haven’t been to Madam X concert.The dancers were phenomenal and Madonna performed challenging dance routines herself, show started on time, atmosphere was one of enthusiasm. There was a mixed gender audience. There’s an upper deck, (mezzanine) which is all I know from where I was seated. I had a great view from row T.I think someone else directed the show, which includes a quote from James Baldwin, followed by the rainbow 🌈 flag.Madonna mastered her craft for this performance of Madam X, I would recommend this concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspiration257939
10,"Madonna, Madam X Concert = Disappointing","The security for Madonna seemed to have been the priority. But not the protection and safety of the audience.There were so many drunk people, constantly wandering around the aisles, back and forth throughout the concert. In our section alone the security came three times to remove drunken obnoxious people.The bar was offering $3 shots which we believe was a big part of the problem.There was absolutely NO Air Conditioning on during the entire concert. The air was thick and heavy and smelled like alcohol.I believe the Health Department should also be notified. Because there were clearly many violations.Disappointed, uncomfortable and WAY overpriced for what the venue offered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaicAntony
50,Madonna comcert,The iconic Wiltern Theatre where there isn’t a bad seat in the house. The place is beautiful in old school decor. Still has that charm. It’s clean. Bathrooms are downstairs.Great sound .The drinks are expensive.$18 for a beer.Parking is good as there are several places to park. We felt safe walking to and from the venue. We paid $25 to park. I would also suggest the metro as it literally drops you off right in front of the venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumble-Brig
50,Art Dec Concert Venue,"Intimate concert venue in Koreatown. Love coming here for shows although the parking can definitely be expensive if you pay for parking there. There’s also parking available on the streets but the area around may be a bit sketchy if you’re walking around at night as a girl. When my friend and I went to the Lauv concert on a Sunday night there was a long line wrapped around the block right when the doors opened, but you could still get a pretty decent view in the back middle part. For the general admission tickets you have a lot of flexibility in deciding where to stand but you may also have difficulty seeing if you’re short. Theres also tables in the back where you can sit should you wish to rest your feet, but there’s only like six of seven of those which seat two people. There’s a bar inside with food (apparently some of the best nachos in LA) and drinks. The bathrooms are inside the main lobby and there are other tables to sit if you need a beak or want to eat before the concert. Overall, it’s a really concert venue for shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanellesua
40,Wiltern Still Going Strong,"I just recently saw ""The Struts"" and wow it was like stepping back in time - it hasn't changed and is still a great venue for music. The lines went fast, security was cool, no egotistical fuss and even the crowds once inside and the music started were great. With all the dancing that went on I was shocked by how so considerate people near me were by giving room and not overblocking my view (we were back midway).Acoustics great, the theatre itself could use some upgrades but it still looks great and with the dough they seem to raking in and the way music and the various entertainment industries are going probably don't want to invest a lot in the landmark.Struts were good, first time I had seem them, after hearing about them. I still say the lead singer is not comparable to Freddie Mercury in voice, showmanship or as an entertainer but he's good and they put on a more than decent show!Restrooms are a bit of a walk but even with a packed house the wait wasn't long and for women? That's nothing short of a miracle. I'll be back here for sure. Parking is convenient too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMFredric
50,One Of My Favorite Places!,"I've been coming here for quite some time to see artists like Ghost, Between the Buried and Me, Meshuggah, and Steven Wilson along with a showing of the 1976 movie ""Network"" as part of LA Conservancy's Last Remaining Seats event, and it never ceases to amaze me! I absolutely adore the lavish Art Deco style that's employed here and it shines like a radiant jewel box inside! To think that there were people who were on the brink of tearing this place down is truly insane and it just makes me all the more grateful to be able to see it today and in such pristine condition nearly a hundred years (or 88 at the time of this review) later. A gorgeous treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014

50,Decibel Metal and Beer Fest,My first experience attending a show at The Wiltern was an awesome one with nothing but positives. Security screening of the people entering the venue went very quick and was thorough. This venue has a large lobby and bar area which was perfect for the bands and other companies to sell their merch along with the various brewers to provide their samples for the festival tastings. Inside the actual theatre area was a cool set up with balcony seating and the lower area having different levels of sections from the floor up offering general standing room. I have attended plenty for shows over the years at lots of different venues but this was the first venue ever to have a server come down long the front row between band sets and see if anyone needed food or drinks to order....coolest idea ever Wiltern staff!!! Overall i would love to be able to attend another event at the Wiltern one day!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130
40,Decibel Metal & Beer Festival 2018,"To be honest, I was unsure what to expect - not from the venue itself, but from the handling of the event within the venue. You see, we were in town for the Decibel Metal & Beer Fest.Not exactly the type of show you'd expect to be hosted by The Wiltern, with its grand old history and gloriously art deco appointments.The organizers and the venue did a fantastic job with this two-day event, ensuring several great craft breweries had space to pour and sell merchandise, while providing performance space for the many bands (and for Dave Mustaine to surprise those of us in the theater by walking out on stage to say a few words...it was surreal!)I also appreciate that the check-in process was quick and painless. We were lined up outside about 45 minutes before doors opened, but they funneled us in through security, ID check and ticket check quickly and efficiently.The Wiltern also wins the ""most wristbands on one person"" category, for sure!They utilized space on both floors for the beer and merchandise, including a step-and-repeat near one of the theater doors. They kept the bar open for mixed drinks, non-alcoholic beverages and food throughout the night, as well.It did get a bit crowded in the lobby area, especially in between sets, but it was manageable (especially if you're small like me), and people were good about not taking up too much space if they saw you coming.As far as performances go, we chose not to be on the floor. Partly because we wanted to be able to go back and forth between breweries, but also because we didn't want to have to fight for a safe space to stand (safe from the many pits that started throughout the night...again, that greatly clashes with The Wiltern, huh?)The seats upstairs weren't exactly comfortable, but it was nice to sit down for a bit anyway. I do think the Wiltern could do with a bit of updating as far as the plushness of the seating went. Most of the seats were fine (we would change seats with every set when returning from beer refills), but there were quite a few that were far too jabby with too many springs and too little padding.Still, the acoustics were great, and we had a nice vantage point of the band and the pit below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimeyTravels
40,The script,Fantastic venue. A bit Art Deco in its design. Good accoustics. The only negative was security. There were little checks as we went past security which made me a little more nervous. I know they wanted to get the queue moving but security should be paramount these days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulHutchings36
50,Hozier Concert,"This is a beautiful theatre, great sound and atmosphere. Definitely the VIP package with parking is well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765keciac
50,Awesome venue in downtown LA,I went to this venue for the first time to see the Conan & friends stand up show - we were able to find metered parking a few blocks away on a Sunday night. I loved this venue - the staff were all very friendly and helpful and it is a very good size but not too large. There is a lovely amount of ornate art deco detail inside the theater and lobby areas which was beautiful and it had an old school glamorous theater vibe that is perfect for LA. I really enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilytO6138AN
50,Amazing venue!,"We saw my favorite Van Morrison! Concert was amazing, location and venue were outstanding! Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L55386
10,Terrible Management,"Worst concert experience ever. The venue itself is very pretty structurally and the walls and ceiling are very beautifully detailed, but the venue does a horrible job of security and management. I upgraded our tickets and was able to gain early entrance into the venue, which was through a separate side entrance. Although the front entrance had metal detectors, the VIP entrance did not. At no time was my purse ever checked or was I ever put through a metal detector. It would have been very easy for someone to sneak a gun in. Shouldn't a concert venue in L.A. be concerned with things like this with all of the shootings going on?We paid an extra $40 for the VIP with private underground lounge, which apparently they leave open to the public anyway. Then what the hell did we pay for??We had general admission standing and while we were there to watch the Devil Makes Three, several mosh pits formed in areas that were not clearly not the front pit where they should be. 3 separate fights broke out and we never saw a security guard the entire time. Concert goers were lighting cigarettes up indoors and people were blacked out drunk and falling all over the floor. Everyone around us was pissed. Usually concert venues have a security guard to monitor and step in when things get out of hand. People were so angry that they were tackling and throwing others on the ground. No concert staff was visible and things quickly got out of hand. The venue was poorly organized and did a terrible job containing the situation. I go to a lot of concerts and I have never had such a bad concert experience. We were so concerned with all of the drama going on around us and our safety that we could not enjoy the music. If you must go to this venue, I strongly recommend getting a seat up top and not general admission.. or just do yourself a favor and don't go. The venue is very poorly managed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trek22701229664
50,Great show in a great venue,"Saw St Paul and the Broken Bones recently. The band was fantastic and the Wiltern is a beautiful facility. The building goes back to the golden age of movie theaters and it has been refitted as a concert hall. The setting is fairly intimate, you can choose to sit(extra charge) or stand, plenty of bars and food, and the sound and acoustics are great. We have been here several times and are never disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScotC22
50,Never been but will definitely go back!!,"We live in San Diego but purchased tickets for a show at this theater. Not a bad drive up, easy to find, affordable parking, lots of choices for convenient preshow dining. Much smaller venue for a more intimate show. Tickets were also reasonably priced. Sound was incredible, venue was clean and friendly staff. We will be back for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicasH9284IB
50,Drab Majesty and Deafheaven never sounded better,"Acoustics, lighting, aliens, fog, purple, sweat, moshing...These are a few few of the lovely words that describe my experience at the Wiltern.I had been to the Wiltern on the first year of this decade for an electronic show.

10,Rip off. Shameful treatment of ticket holders. Ushers not guiding attendees. Poor lighting crowded foyer....,"My husband and I were excited to go see the 'Yellow Submarine' movie at the Wiktern.Having read about the line around the block to enter the theater, we arrived early to not have to stand for too long. I had bought VIP TICKETs. But was not made aware in email confirming purchase of any special entry or otherwise. Instead the day before I got an email from Ticketmaster that Parkingcould be reserved for $50! Early 'get in front of the line' was available for $30 per person!Never in my life have I been solicited in this fashion after ticket purchase for any event.The doors were supposed to open at 7 pm, we thought the movie would start around 7pm.Instead the doors opened around 7.15, we went in and were hustled for drinks and food, there was no space to mingle, the lighting was awful. I had been looking forward to be impressed by beautiful architecture but it was dark and crowded and unkempt. To top it all, staff was not directing ticket holder to the correct location for our seating area. We finally made it to VIP SECTION, THEN SAT IN ORDINARY CHAIRS for a movie experience this was the worst seating in the world.It actually began at 8.15 or so???How stupid can this get? The management must believe that mismanagement brings in customers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monalikhandagle2012
40,Art Deco Gem,The Wiltern is one of my favorite venues. It’s art deco architecture is beautiful! The sound is amazing and there’s not a bad seat in the theater. I do have a HUGE complaint: on the night of the concert there was a loooong and a short line to enter. No signs. Short line was “Fast Pass”$15 extra pp to enter early. An airline came to mind. NOT A FAN!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hairup
50,Fantastic music venue in LA,"The Wiltern is a fabulous music venue located in Koreatown, LA. I’ve seen many shows here and I never miss the opportunity to return. With great sound quality, excellent view from any seat, and easy parking in the area, the Wiltern is one of my favorite music venues in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karula76

Wonderful staff and very friendly from the security at the door to the food and beverage servers. Well organized event, great production, and super cool vintage theater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/974hillaryl
40,Nice Venue for a Great Evening,"The theater shares a parking structure with Ralph’s supermarket; turning into it was quite chaotic. We entered through the north of two gates on Oxford Street and self parked for $25+$1 using credit card. Saw several quick eating choices like Waba Grill close by, a Coffee Bean just across Western, and the subway station was right across Wilshire. We even got a glimpse of Deadmaus arriving at the theater! Interior atmosphere of this green iconic theater was jolly. Many bars on multiple floors including basement where restrooms are (often with long lines). Drinks a bit pricy. We got good assigned seats close to the stage. The 8-9 pm opening act of pulsating music warmed up loyal fans. Sound quality was good: chairs practically vibrating. The main act featuring an unusual 60-person orchestra was fantastic. The staff were courteous and helpful. Security was abundant and alert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LnS2004
30,Beautiful theatre but sound is awful,We actually left early while seeing our favorite bands because the sound was so awful. The horns were sharp and hurt our ears. The theatre itself is beautiful.

40,Saint Motel at the Wiltern,I haven’t been to the Wiltern for a concert for a couple of years. This time I sat in the Lodge. The seat was great. The sound pretty clear and the view was excellent. I have seen Saint motel in San Francisco and Sacramento in the past. They put on a good show but should dial back the television commercials a little. The opening act was odd but entertaining; Kolars. The DJ arc was terrible and forgettable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardkH9709BN
50,gorgeous venue,"Attended a Hanson concert here at Christmas time. Hanson fans are pretty serious about lining up and what order people get inside. The staff was super accommodating about keeping all the lines straight.Once inside, the venue was breathtaking. I'm super glad I was able to experience a show here.There are different levels to the general admission area. As you enter, you are given a wrist band that allows you onto each level. Once a level is full, there are no more wrist bands for it. It helps to keep everyone safe and control who is where. The wrist bands made for a much better viewing experience and a lot less pushing.The women's bathroom was quite a walk. You have to exit theater area, go into the lobby, and then climb down a flight of stairs.acoustics are awesome inside. At one point, Hanson turned off all the sound equipment and acapela sang a song at the front of the stage that could be heard by everyone. It was a magical experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracD9337MM

50,Great Venue,"I've been here twice now and the first time i had floor seating and it was great, i did not feel over crowded at all. The only let down from my first experience was a few drunk girls behind us but they did not bother us they just did their own thing.For my second concert there i was a bit worried at first because i got balcony seats but honestly we had such a great view. No matter where you are seated you will be able to have a great view, the sound and acoustics were great. The only thing that was hard at first was finding our seats, but overall it was great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyt238
40,Good venue but some let downs.,Great venue in general. Art Deco design is very nice. Music sound and acoustics are good. Let downs are the toilets flooded with urine and it's $16 for a beer.

50,Beautiful theater,"The Venue: Definitely a historic theater in LA. Love love love the interior of the theater, beautiful ceiling, unique deco. It's a mid size theater, even 2nd floor has good view of the stage.The Staffs: Very friendly. To make buying alcohol more efficiently, they checked ID once we entered the theater & gave us a wristband so the bartender didn't have to spend time check everyone's ID and could serve our drinks faster!! Yeah~The Parking: There is a parking structure behind the theater. Street metered parking. If you don't mind walking a little bit further, residential area free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa

50,"Best Venue, Best Service","I purchased tickets as a birthday surprise for my husband to see Robin Trower. Then my husband surprised me by announcing he was having knee surgery just prior. Checked with his doctor and he gave okay for him to attend if not a lot of walking. Contacted the Wiltern and Tim was amazing. Said they had VIP package for the event that allowed parking steps away and that when it was time to go up if we needed an elevator they had one we could use. The VIP experience was perfect, especially as part of his birthday. It includes parking, an area with a bar and appetizers for while you wait before the normal venue access opens. The appetizers are free, but you do purchase your drinks. Everyone we met there from the parking attendants, to hosts, bartenders, waitresses, seating staff, etc were very friendly and helpful. Take that plus a terrific venue, the Wiltern Theatre was built in 1930, and you have a place with great style and wonderful accoustics. It was all perfect.

Definitely what a grand old theater should look like.I had heard that it had nice velvet seats, but maybe those are only in the balcony. On the floor level it was just a bunch of typical stackable chairs, zip tied together into rows. They are a bit too close together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valzebub
40,Awesome venue for concerts! Attended The Hendrix Experience,"Very nice theatre seating in an intimate setting. Unfortunately, parking is at a premium. I was surprised parking at Ralph's supermarket next door cost $25!! Not much choice but to pay unless you want your car towed away. Drinks are overpriced. I paid $16 for a beer in a plastic cup. Was the concert worth it even if I couldn't avoid being ripped off? Definitely!! A big plus if you enjoy Korean food as The Wiltern is in Koreatown where you won't find any other types of restaurants except McDonalds down the street. Be brave and give them a try! Koguryo restaurant across and up the street in a small mall is highly recommended by me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheaptravelhunter

Loved the beautiful architecture, show, staff and the Wiltern Underground. Purchased the Undergound upgrade for both nights and it's totally worth it for early entry and pre-access to the clubby bar with memorabilia and delicious catered Italian food.

30,"Spectacular building, crappy concert venue","Went to see jake Bugg here....was blown away by the building...A wonderfully kept Art Deco theatre, BUT the atmosphere of the concert was totally killed by the ridiculous , what obviously were, health and safety measures.If I book standing at a concert in the UK, I expect to be able to stand near the stage amongst a usually dense crowd of people determined to enjoy themselves. Not here, we were told on arrival that the front standing area was 'at capacity ' (clearly wasn't) so we had to stand in a side area, that had walkways clearly marked by white lines on the floor. Woe betide anyone who actually tried to enjoy themselves and stepped over the line!!!A steward would run up and tell you not to step outside the area! The atmosphere was stifled, the crowd were dull (no choice really) and it was one of the worst gigs I have been to (no disrespect to JB, he sounded fabulous) SO if you want to go to a concert here.....go early, and get a spot at the front!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonQ144

If you have GA tickets there are usually VIP tables available to buy if you want sit and relax. Expensive but worth it if your feet or back are aching! Good service at the tables. Usually there is a bar with a short line somewhere which I also appreciate. Bathrooms in the basement not great, but bars down there too, so not all bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmfesq
40,The Wiltern is a great venue for a concert - All seats reasonable close to the stage,"I bought ""reserved"" seats in the upper floor, not the GA downstairs. (Perfume from Japan - great concert but that's Perfume) The Wiltern is clean, well maintained, good staff, and a nicer area of Los Angeles. There is great Wiltern parking next door. Do not enter the Ralph's entrance. Use the venue entrance. (The Ralph's parking is messy and noticed the cars fighting the venue ""line of"" people on the sidewalk. The staff was doing their best to keep the cars go in and out of Ralph's portion but were making drivers mad. I had reserved tickets so watched the car merry go round from the 3rd level. I guess tis turned out to be a review of the parking structure... Sorry The venue is a great place to see a concert ....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QZOCK
30,Nice theater but could be managed a little better,"I was here for the Perfume concert which was an incredible experience. However they said the doors open at 7:00 but we didn't start moving until 7:30. We had to stay an extra half hour in the cold outside. A group cut the line behind us when the line split up due to keeping traffic inlets unblocked. So unfair because that section of the line was waiting for over an hour. I was worried a fight would break out but the group finally buzzed off, and those jerks also had the nerve to start smoking after they cut in line.Security checkpoint was smooth and quick. Show said it would start at 8 but it ended up being at 8:30. I hope they didn't cut songs out when they started late. One thing I wish they had is multiple merchandise stands. There were at least 200 people waiting to buy merchandise after the show but only 4-5 clerks at a single stand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuonGluon
50,Beautiful Theatre!,"I've been coming to the Wiltern for years and it's still one of my favorite places to see a show. It's really beautiful inside, the sound is great and there really isn't a bad place to stand. The last time I was here was to see a comedian and there was assigned seating, but usually, it's general admission. There is an upstairs with seats, as well as the floor. I think access to the upstairs depends on the show and what tickets you buy. Never had a bad experience here. The location is great, too - right in Koreatown, so there are lots of places to go and eat before and after your show ends. Parking can be expensive, though, so be prepared, although I believe, if you see a show on the weekend, street parking might be free? (I've heard this, but never tried. I just bite the bullet and pay to park.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oolcayatcay
50,Excellent concert venue!,"I attended the Wiltern for a BABYMETAL concert, and it was excellent, if not a little different. The floor is divided up into sections, which is somewhat unique for a venue of this type, but it worked out in the end. I was in the pit up front and was as close to the stage as I've ever been. The acoustics in this place are excellent, even for a heavy metal concert of this type. The decor is very elegant and inviting, and the restrooms were clean and well-lit. Had a great time and will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alonso_Enriquez
40,Well appointed historic theatre. Drinks expensive.,"We were in LA visiting from Australia and wanted to see a rock concert for the experience. We saw Generation Axe (which was average).The Wiltern is a well appointed historic theatre which reminded me somewhat of Sydney's wonderful State Theatre. The seats are comfortable, the staff are friendly and you feel like it's a big occasion just being there.The only real drawback was the price of the drinks ($15 for a beer) although at least they had Lagunitas IPA on tap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenp795
50,Great for a show,This was my second trip to the Wiltern. Classic 20's movie house redone for many different types of productions. The architecture inside is worth the trip alone. It's not too big just right to see our favorite band.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gfrenchman
40,An excellent historical theater,"This place looks great with all the excellent preservation of the old theater built back in the 1930's. It was my first time here and I watched Art Garfunkel live in concert and I never saw so much of a ""No video, audio, and photography allowed"" signs all over the lobby. The best seat watching like a Art Garfunkel concert is at the back area since it's a little bit elevated. The front seats are leveled and you're pretty much seeing the back of the head of someone seating in front of you and hope that someone is not a tall person. I doubt it will be the same when watching a rock concert it's mostly likely a festival seating and probably the no video, audio, and photography is allowed. Their food and drinks and mostly the alcoholic drinks are a bit pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe_TrekkerXXX
40,Great small venue!,Beautiful building - Art Deco design. You need to know the drill going in though! We were in line for an hour before the doors opened and had time to find out from the locals. Bypass the drinks etc on the way in - run right to the pit to get a bracelet - first 100 in the door get a pit bracelet and are right in front of the band! In this case Elton John! I would have been angry if I had missed that opportunity for a beer! The audio is not as good from up there as the sound pretty much goes over you but to be that close - priceless!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/breezie5
50,"Cheers Tony! Benefit concert for Tony M, with Steve Vai, Zakk W, John5 and so many more","Great to finally make it. The show was for a great cause and when Tom Morello, Nuno and Eddie Trunk all come to help a friend having it at the Wiltern was ideal. What a great venue, very pretty with solid acoustics. I sat at a small table top directly in front of the soundboard all the way in the back on floor. Great view and the sound of course was great. ROCK and ROLL, and Holy Guitar SOLOS!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8981HAdavidb
50,Top Venue with great sound,I recently returned to Wiltern Theatre after a 20 year hiatus. The surrounding area sure has changed a lot (for the better!) but the inside of the venue still retains its charm. The ornate decorum matched perfectly with the well organized staff. Everyone was super professional which added to the ambiance. I will definately be returning sooner knowing that their expectations for excellence are well met and appreciated by all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraM291
40,Great venue,"Great venue. I got to the here at 7:30 for an 8:00 show. There was a long line so I grabbed a cocktail and slice of pizza at the Novel Cafe before the show. By 7:45, there was no line and we got in immediately and went to our orchestra seats which where face value of $70 for the Psycho Tour by Margaret Cho. The metro station is near by but I took an Uber from downtown- super convenient. I'd definitely watch future shows/ concerts at this venue. There's a full bar inside as well so you can drink during the show :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
40,Great Concert experience,Came to see a Brandi Carlile Concert and the Acoustics are very nice here. Also afterwards there street vendors who sell ghetto dogs (bacon wrapped hotdogs),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lemountg
50,Great venue and great acoustics,"Beautiful vintage art deco theatre. We saw a concert there, and the acoustics are great and the people that work there are awesome!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/161judis
30,"Beautiful theater, great sound","I saw Steven Wilson here. The sound in the theater was fantastic. The building is an Art Deco masterpiece. I give it only three stars because of the seating configuration in the section I was in. My seats were in the farthest back section of regular seating. Being in the back isn't bad because it's not that far from the stage, But much of that section is level, with all the chairs being at the same height except for the back two rows, and the floor is much higher than the stage. I was looking through heads for most of the show until I got up and stood towards the back. Get seats farther forward if you go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunburnt_curt
50,Great concert venue!,What a wonderful place for a concert. It is a beautiful theater. Staff were so organized and made it easy. Sound was amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201lisas
50,Perfect Concert Going Experience,"I attended the Kaiser Chiefs concert on 4/25/15 and as they are my favorite band, I normally get to the venue early to get in line to get a good spot up front. This time around, I injured my knee and couldn't stand for a long period of time. The outside security officer radioed back to the VIP Coordinator, Danielle and she came out to explain the VIP program to my friend and I. For $25, you can skip the line and get in an hour before everyone else and for $80 per person, you can get a table, access to the VIP lounge/underground parking, and all you can eat/drink! Such a deal! Danielle was super awesome and also arranged for ADA seating for us right above the General Admission pit. I was able to see the band perfectly and was able to sit and not hurt my knee.The venue is so very beautiful, parking is cheap and easy ($20) the sound is fantastic and all of the staff were friendly and helpful and knew what they were doing....it's my favorite venue in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cherylcyn
50,Billy Idol Live @The Wiltern,this venue is one of the best I go to for live music. An LA crowd who know music add to a performance excitement. Drink service and staff are great and very accommodating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/don9611
40,"Excellent venue, and free parking on street","My first time at the Wiltern and probably not the last.My seats:I was lucky to score seats in the 2nd level for the Spandau Ballet concert. Excellent seats, dead center, and slightly inclined so I could see over the 1st level. I think if I were to get row 1 of the 2nd Level, it would have been even sweeter.Parking:I heard fans complain on Yelp about the $20 parking, but also saw tips to park on the street. Being it was a Sunday, street parking was free! (Score!). We arrived at 6 pm and I came down Western, and turned a right on Wilshire, and found a spot 2 blocks away on Wilshire, just across from the 24 hr fitness. Its metered, so even during the week, its free after 6 pm.Food:My GF was hungry but didn't want Denny's (next door to the WIltern), and we only had an hour before doors opened. There was a Starbucks next to my parking spot, and a Subway next door to the 24 Hr Fitness and a sushi joint next door to that. We went for sushi and made it to the Wiltern with 10 minutes before doors opened.Note: There is a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf located literally across the street from the Wiltern as well.While walking to the venue, I saw the line literally wrapped around the corner of the block! Fortunately for me, I had VIP tickets, which I assumed meant I didn't have to queue in the main line. I was right! We had a special line at the front, which had maybe 10 people deep. We got in, but unfortunately still had to wait for the theater doors to the seats to open.Minus one star:The Wiltern staff was not very organized, and didn't know what to do with VIP ticket holders like me as I thought I was entitled to special swag, etc. as promised on the Live Nation ticket site. I didn't want to get riled up over staff incompetence, so I hope the promoter will be sending me the swag. I got great seats and was bump to the front, that was pretty cool there.. although I thought VIP would mean earlier access to the venue.Souvenirs:Buy your stuff before the show. As we left, there were lots of stuff sold out. They take cash and charge, but the charge machine is slow. There's scalpers outside the venue after the show if you want knock off stuff.Wristbands if you plan on drinking:We didn't plan on drinking, so we skipped the wristband check. Drinks, I heard, were not cheap! Plan on spending money.While waiting in our seats, a girl came to take drink orders, so I got us 2 sodas (in a plastic 16 oz party cup) which came to $7, which I guess would be ouch if it were anyplace but a concert venue.Overall experience:It was a great show. 2 hours of nostalgic songs by one of the influential British Invasion band in the 80s.Former KROQ DJ Richard Blade warmed the crowd with trivia, and the show started at 8:45, and was also streamed live on Yahoo! screen.yahoo.com/live/ev…When the show was over, the crowd dissipated quite quickly, and it was so easy to get to our car and leave.An EXCELLENT evening for 2 girls reminiscing about our High School days, and remembering it was 30 years ago we last saw this band.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
50,The Wiltern is Wonderful,"I took my daughter to see Tween Sensation Shawn Mendes on 11/26/14. Sold out concert full of screaming girls. At the last moment I checked Twitter and The Wiltern had an Underground Package for sale. For only $40 per person you get your very own parking spot underneath The Wiltern, you get escorted to the VIP Lounge to wait until seating and have a Complimentary Beverage and Snack and a Laminated Lanyard Memento. The Staff at The Wiltern is Amazing! Siliva arranged for the Underground parking, The parking attendants are friendly and helpful with my bad attempt to park LOL. Olivia escorted us in and gave us a quick tour, bathrooms, lounge area and answered everyones question with friendly enthusiasm (and we avoided the long line outside in the cold to get in and $20 Ralphs parking). The Wiltern has EXCELLENT ACOUSTICS and is beautiful inside. The ushers and security people are friendly and approachable/helpful. This was our first visit to The Wiltern and it was PERFECT! Would love to go again with my husband and see a grown-up band :) I am picky and love great customer service and The Wiltern has it all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reedsmama
50,Pay the extra money to get in early!,"On a recent visit to see Neon Trees, I missed the part of my ticket buying experience where I could pay $20.00 extra to Not have to stand in that horrible line that wraps all the way around the theatre. Do it! It's worth it. You have to get here early or you're waiting at the back of the line in the heat for a long time. That being said, I loved everything else about this venue. I saw one of the same bartenders from the House Of Blues, so that made it extra special!The architecture of the building is interesting enough to make you want to thoroughly scour its nooks and crannies for hidden treasures. And skip the concert altogether.I was able to get in the VIP section(for free) after going in, and that was amazing. What I don't understand is how anybody could be sitting down during the concert! Why go to a beautiful theatre to listen to a rock band, to sit down?The drinks are pricey(of course)and mostly water, so I recommend stopping at The Beer Belly down the street for food and cheaper libations.The hidden little bar downstairs is very chic and worth the climb down. Go go go!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephie1375
10,Worst experience ever.,"Let's just say coming to this venue has been the worst concert experience I've ever had, & I've been to a lot of concerts.. Staff is absolutely HORRIBLE, cussing at people who bought tickets to their venue & being super unhelpful! If I were you I would find a different venue to your concert choice & leave the wiltern as the last option you have! Never returning!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydneymykael
50,classic art deco cinema,"this is an art deco cinema saved from the wrecking ball and converted into a music venue, it is very easy to get to as there is a metro station across the street from the venue",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4johns4
50,Great concert venue. The VIP option was special,My wife and I travel to 8-10 different concert venues each year. We saw Switchfoot at the Wiltern. The band is one of my favorites. The venue is a very old but well maintained building. We added the VIP option which allowed us to take in the sound check before the show. We also met the band and took a photo with them. They were very gracious and warm. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes music and the special people who share it with their fans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardkH9709BN
40,One of my favorite venues!,"I had a fantastic time at the Wiltern when I was there recently to see one of our favorites, Umphrey's McGee! The sound, security and ambiance was excellent. High ceilings and a large balcony made it so that the lower dance floor was not terribly crowded - security let everyone get a little schwastey without being too militant (for comparison, see the House of Blues - San Diego, who policed everyone as if they were 14 year olds trying to sneak a beer). Korea town is an interesting place with some food options, but it was mostly unique due to its immersion in another culture of such prominence in the city. We had a great time and would definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JColk
40,parking is pricey but nice venue,"One of the many LA area historic venues, the Wiltern is a great location for shows. Quite enjoyed the entire, staffing were polite. Only issue i had was one didn't have much choice but pay the exorbitant high rate for parking in a garage, wasn't much else available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernk
20,A horrible place for a rock show,"I have been to countless concerts over the years and I HAVE NEVER been babysat by security guards in the pit before! They were throwing people out of the venue that were just trying to have a good time and enjoy the music. Their rules: “No moshing, No crowd surfing, No fun” has NO PLACE AT A ROCK CONCERT!! If they can’t handle a rock show, then they shouldn't host one—host concerts like Nsync or something. This was the lamest concert I’ve ever been to. I won't be back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eatmee
40,Nice venue for small gigs!,"I came here once with a friend to watch Feist. It was a while back (at least 1 year ago) but I remember having a good impression of it. I like that it's small but cozy in a way, general admission floor is separate from the upper floor where there a bar in the back. Either Feist was very good live or the sound system was super good, audio didn't disappoint. The crowd was fun and respectable.Parking can be unpleasant if you don't want to pay the fee for closer parking. I got lucky and found a coin meter about 1 block away therefore saved on the however much parking would have charged be for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaL143
50,Great venue,We saw Fitz and the Tantrums at the Wiltern on July 27th. We were blown away by the show and the style of the historic theatre. We love the deco design and details. Great acoustics and perfect location for a concert!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresat31
50,Stunning!,"My Girlfriend and I went to see Jason Mraz here and all I have to say is WOW! The architecture is simply amazing! The acoustics in the concert hall sounded perfect! The drinks were a little pricey and call a cab well in advance! Taxis are very few and far between, so come prepared! Thankfully there are a couple of bars right next door that you can grab a drink at while waiting for your ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bryanchatfield
50,buena vista social club at the wiltern..........,.........if you are an afficienado of fine auditoriums for world music from cuba's legendary buena vista social club to van morrison's caravan of cosmic dreams!!!!!!!!!!! the wiltern is a great venue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! located in the heart of los angeles..........there's a great bar next door and many fine restaurants to walk to including a fabulous korean bbq on western......then make it a marvelous night for a moondance walking around the Silver Lake resevoir........the Beverly Hills of the silent movie era!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepriceCBSnews
50,A throw back to the past,"First time attending a concert (Citizen Cope) at the Wiltern and I was very impressed with the entire experience. Starting off with standing outside in line before entering the concert. Just observing the Wilshire/Korentown area was a first and we really enjoyed the people watching and taking in the sites. Secondly the architecture of this theatre reminds me of the theatre's of old and was mesmerizing when just walking around or sitting at our seat.The sound quality was excellent and I loved the intimate setting inside as there is not a bad seat in the place. Our seats were center stage in the lower level of the balcony in FF and was a perfect view to just sit and enjoy the music. Cocktail service to our seats was a nice touch which made in nice to just sit and enjoy the evening rather than getting our own drinks and the prices are what you would expect,Parking was kind of expensive, but that is to be expected in Los Angeles. Right next to the Wiltern on Western Ave is a 4 story parking structure and the cost was $20.I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of music to attend an event here and I know my wife and I will be looking to see another concert here in the near future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radman143
50,Beautiful Deco Building makes for an intimate show,"This is one of my favorite place to see a musical show. I have seen many bands here of different styles. It is small enough that I always feel satisfied. Sometimes it's all seating, and others the floor is open. The only thing is parking is pretty expensive across the street at the parking structure but it is LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKrisC
50,Beautiful theater,Great theater to see a concert. The Metro is across the street. Love the green tile on the exterior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAJFJ2
50,Classy place to go,"Finally made it to a concert at the Wiltern theater. The art deco architecture is worth the trip by itself. The acoustics are good and the seating for Aimee Mann included seats up to the stage. We sat stage level, general admission, row EEE, super seats. Several bars available for drinks, prices are what you would expect. 8$ to $14 depending on what you order. Parked in the parking structure directly across for the theater and paid $15. Side street parking can be found if you get there a bit early and don't mind searching. The parking structure was easy in and out and conveniently located. Ate at the Novel Cafe, two doors down on Wilshire Blvd. Full bar, reasonable prices, good service and good food. Will be watching for another opportunity to the Wiltern. Great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oneOCbob
40,Beautiful!,"Wonderful place for a concert. Just can't understand why they have to gouge like most venues .... $14 for a beer or $5 for a mini water.I can understand the captive audience thing, but taking advantage of people is another thing. Maybe this, with the surcharges that the ticketing people charge is why concert attendance is in the decline.Had a great time, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldTanner
