50,Engaging account,Fronted by a lovely historical house with original features is this engaging overview of the cityâ€™s founding and following decades.In the late 1880s Burbank was founded by an eponymous dentist who had moved to the west coast from New Hampshire.Period furniture and furnishings are in place and add to the evocative history.,permia
50,Great free mueseum,"This place is great. Lots of interesting artifacts of American society from the early 1900's(and before). Also cool exhibits of the beginning of film production in Burbank and the history of animation and television(they have a jacket Johnny Carson wore on the tonight show). Plus some neat old cars that have been fully restored, clothes and furniture that are a 100 years old that are in great condition, an original statue from Bob's Big Boy, sections dedicated to the service of the Burbank fire department, police department and old military rifles. Upstairs they have an entire room full of really old pieces of pottery, pipes, musical instruments and more from around the world. Plus it's all free, the only downside I see is that they are only open on the weekends from 1pm to 4pm but it's definitely worth checking out. You could spend over an hour here and not fully be able to take in all they have to offer. Will be going back for sure. Docents and board members were very nice and more than willing to share stories and information about the exhibits. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Sam H
40,Great free little museum,"This is a great little museum to learn the story of Burbank. Burbank is a little town that is an unknow cornerstones of America history. Starting out as a wheat and sheep farm, Burbank grew to become the home of companes such as Lockheed (SR-71 & U2 spy plane) Disney Studios, Warner Brothers Studios, and Nickelodeon to name a few.",Steve Wong
30,Obscure Museum Full of Local Curiosities,"The Gordon R. Howard Museum has an interesting, if eccentric, collection from Burbank's history - displays on early aviation industry, the movie business (with an emphasis on Disney and Warner Bros)., dioramas with late 19th century clothing, a room full of old fire trucks, plus a little Victorian house (1887) you can wander through. Open 1-4 on Sundays; located just off Victory and Olive. Free, fun and distinctly odd.",SoCalRambler
