30,First tine to this place,"They have free snacks , water and coffee. The spa pool, saunas are small. Actually the whole place is small. I have change towel since I used it to dry my self from the pool, used same towel after the steam sauna and used the same towel after I shaved at the lower shower. The korean lady doing the body scrub was pointing and saying to me that I should not be changing towels from time to time! What the heck? Mo wonder only 1 or 2 customers were there at the same time on Friday at 2-5 pm!",Mary R
