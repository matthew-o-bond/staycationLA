50,Address has changed- now Griffith Park. Not occurring in 2019!!!,"Just thought I’d save some people the trip! Went w few years ago with my friends cause it was close by and it was super cute (definitely for little kids). Was gonna go this year bc now I live even closer but apparently it’s moved down to Griffith Park and won’t be open in 2019. Went to the website and all new info. is there, including $15 ticket pricing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmartin6
50,"Great neighborhood tradition ... ""Help me!""","A pleasure to have so close by, Boney Island is the type of thing small town memories are made of. Children and adults alike will marvel at the scope and execution of this front yard extravaganza. Come and be amazed and let your inner child out. But please drive safely and stay alert as people and pets are everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CleChiLa
50,Halloween Carnival,This is a residential area very popular during the month of October. The owner of the residence spruce the front yard with halloween decorations completer with tree house. It's like a mini Disneyland but for free. There is even a magic water show where the all bones Master Maxilla serves as the ring master. Plants and pumpkins sing halloween jingles. Skeltons up the trees try to do a trapeze. There is even a skelton fortune teller for the kids. My pre school grandson was so amaze the fortune teller knows his name and birthday. Little did he know I provided the information to the house owner. He pretends to be part of the crowd with a big glass of soda in one hand but actually the glass is where the mike is hidden. There were skeletons on the rooftop doing the carousel magic carpet. The only fee is to get up the tree house which is $10.00. If you have little kids this is one place not to be missed for Halloween.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
