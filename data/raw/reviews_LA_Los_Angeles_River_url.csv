30,Runs Through the Basin,"Very long river running through the whole area. Often does not have any water, so just an empty concrete culvert. Scene of much filming. Homeless folks live along it. There are probably some interesting areas, but I have never seen them. Still a landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
20,Still not much of an attraction,"Despite the noble efforts of a group called ""Friends of the LA River"" to fix up the river, there is still not much to savor. As one walks along the river on the trail one remains quite far away from the actual riverbed, which is down a steep 50-100 foot cement embankment that's covered in graffitti...not too pretty of a sight. The trail must be shared with bicyclists who speed along at extremely high speeds...it actually feels dangerous sometimes...they won't stop and you better get out of their way!Unfortunately there are also the homeless to deal with...there are encampments along the trail and it makes one feel unsafe...after all, many of them are on drugs (we saw one taking a ""trip""). I would have loved to explore the very lush growth of the riverbed (I would have to climb down the cement embankment...there are no steps to get down to it) but we were afraid of who might be lurking in the growth and we decided not to for safety reasons.The actual trail itself, minus the problems with the bicycles, is paved and flat...there is really not much to see after you walk along it for 500-1000 feet...it's basically all the same. There are a few interpretive displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
40,Nice Views of the Los Angeles River from Queen Mary Area,We enjoyed the views of Los Angeles River in early November 2016. Water levels were good. People were enjoying going out on boats in the Long Beach portion of the LA River. We also liked the lights on the bridge by the LA River. We saw this view fromt eh Queen Mary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,Unexploited Attarction,"The Los Angeles River is a famous drainage channel that goes from north to south in LA. It has appeared in many movies and video games and has become a famous icon of the city. It is not especially pretty to look at, but nevertheless, it's an icon, and it looks in real life exactly like in the movies.This is something strange for LA (and the US in general)â€”something that could potentially serve as a great tourist attraction is not actively exploited as such by the authorities or private enterprise. Yes, there are some private tours that include the ""river"", but nothing I know of focusing on it, let alone from a well-known company. I would expect things like recreate-chases-from-GTA-V tours, etc. What are the best spots to see the river? What are the most interesting access points, tunnels, rides, etc.? I may never know.Moreover, access to the obvious good viewpoints (bridges over the river) is not made very easy for pedestrians. Granted, this is normal in LA where the car is treated as the most important thing, but you would expect something that's right outside of Downtown to be more accessible. Instead, you have to walk on a very narrow sidewalk through a tunnel and then for a bit longer in a very unpleasant atmosphere; and it's like that in other places too (hopefully not all of them).Basically an interesting tourist attraction for people who have seen it in movies and games, but it's not marketed and exploited as such.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
30,The Concrete River of LA ...,"The LA River is definitely no Seine, Tiber or Thames as it's usually just a dry bed or trickle of water hemmed in by huge unsightly concrete walled flood channel walls. Best seen when passing over a bridge or if in the Vernon area. I've driven over it for decades. Hopefully urban renewal will spruce it up someday. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Go Greased Lighting!!,I drove down to the alas river to take some shots from the bridges and then found an access tunnel under the 4th street bridge.You can then drive down onto the concrete and take some awesome shots from the river level.Tip: In the movie Grease the race started at the 6th St bridge and went to the 1st street bridge and back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewS666_666
30,A dry run,"The Los Angeles river might or might not flow, you might see water near Long Beach. There is a dry concrete river bed that runs in Los Angeles in case there are floods. It will look familiar to viewers of films such as Grease the dry concrete river bed pops up a lot in movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,Now,"Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. Being restored. Spent an Earth Day cleaning it up. It was unbelievable what we pulled out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
30,Long Beach has water; rest is basically a dry concrete river bed,"The Los Angeles River is an oddity. In the Long Beach area there is actually water. Due to the tidal flows from the Pacific Ocean, that part of the Los Angeles River has water.Further up, one finds a dry concrete river bed. In major floods, which is a rarity for the LA area, I have seen even these concrete river beds full of water. Its rare though for such floods. In that case the water also flows to Long Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,LA River kayak,"Kayaked the Los Angeles River today with George and crew from LA River Exhibitions.Weather was perfect, fun on the river, alot of rocks. By the way, they hold your car keys so they won't end up in the river. More rapids and rocks than I expected so fun in the rapids, not boring, can be a little difficult if you're over 60 like me, water (you will get wet) is warm.Beautiful nature along the river. A fun, easy bike ride back, a wonderful day. Our 11:30 am trip took a bit over 3 hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DickK759
10,You've got to be kidding.,"I grew up in Los Angeles. I am still looking for the Los Angeles river. The LA river is a concrete drainage channel, nothing more. It is using for filing movies because it is concrete and can be driven in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyTraveler2010
40,See the river in Elysian Valley,"The L.A. river is a joke for the most part - however, in Elysian Valley just north of downtown, there are bike paths and greenery and alot of bird life. Cormorants, egrets, and herons live here and it being improved by the city all the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaA539
40,Wild refuge in the middlle of Los Angelels,"Probably only 2-4 miles long as scenic spot. Miles of wet open concrete thanks to brilliance of Army Engineering Corps. None theless-crayfish, water, trees, parks, herons, ducks, quiet ponds & rushing river from Burbank to the outskirts of downtown L.A.--walk it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWalter
30,"To look at it, you wouldn't think you were standing in the flood plain....","Not a native but a LONG-time resident of Los Angeles, realized over time that the terrain flash floods with the infrequent ""torrential""(for Angelenos) rains, hence the Army Corps of Engineers concrete channels. While there are attempts to naturalize it and even now featuring kayak tours, the concrete ain't going away. Still, along a great part of the river, there are also some well-kept bike paths(near Griffith Park and the Autry Museum) and if riding, being careful not to watch the wildlife TOO closely and risking a collision with others on the path or like my wife did once, a fence post, it can be good cheap entertainment with exercise to boot! We've been lucky to observe(carefully) ducks, geese, cormorants,herons, teals, raccoons, and even beaver on our many rides. During the right season with clean air and abundant sunshine, it's an alternative to going to the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigleemo
10,Someone considers this an attraction?,"The Los Angeles River is very very sad...years ago it was cemented up for flood control. The city is trying desperately to bring back small parts of it with an attempt to naturalize parts of it. However, no matter how many native plants that are introduced to the river bottom land, the sides are still concrete and the whole experience is rather unpleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
10,What river?,Do you mean the virtually dried up concrete bowl with who knows what in it? The old bridges over it have more life and character.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
50,big [--] carpe biggest i ever seen,"my home boy told me about this spot in the river so its my first time there.so within 20 minutes bam 1,2,3,4,5 there just hitting next thing you know my salt waterpole hits with a 35 pound carpe address off the 2 EXIT FLETCHER INTO THE L.A RIVER follow the bicycle lane headed east",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cito420
