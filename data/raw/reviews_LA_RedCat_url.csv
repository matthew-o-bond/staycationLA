50,Small gallery well worth a visit,"Really lovely small gallery, very modern and well kept. Spent a couple of hours looking at the exhibition, really interesting, well put together a nice relaxing afternoon after the bustle of downtown,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yorky10054
30,"Interesting venue, but I expected more","Pros:Small theater, usually not overly crowded, easy parking shared with the Disney concert hall. They have a lounge that's open pre and post-concert, which is especially nice.Cons:Feels a bit budget for downtown LA standards. Chairs are NOT comfortable. The programming is indie and eclectic (which can be both good and bad).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
40,Gregory Maqoma/Vuani Dance --Outstanding!!,11.7.13 saw a most outstanding performance by the South African group.The dancing and choreography was intense and fascinating. The 3 singers were very soulful and haunting. Thumbs up!! The best show I've seen in a long time. Must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
