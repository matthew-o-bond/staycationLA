50,The friendliest place! And lots of bargains,"I spend at least 2 to 3 hours in the Sherman oaks antique mall every year when I come to visit my son. The managers are fun, friendly, and always willing to open a locked case or answer a question. They makes the rounds of the mall to check on their customers routinely, so I never have to go looking for them when I need help. The mall has a great variety of antiques in a large price range, and many of the vendors have sales. So I never leave empty-handed. Even the individual vendors are friendly and talkative. The merchandise ranges from jewelry, to vintage clothing, to fine antique art glass and crystal, to porcelain and pottery. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manddymill

50,Best vintage store for jewelry and vintage decor,"Always stop here when looking for unique costume jewelry, cases and cases from every era. Lots of affordable estate engagement rings as well. Although I go for the jewelry there's a wide selection of vintage decor. Great prices on Lalique, Tiffany, Chanel , etc. Worth the drive to the San Fernando Valley. A twenty minute drive over the hill from Beverly Hills or Santa Monica and prices drop by half or more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/67janicej
40,Clean and Well Organized Antiques,"We stopped at this antique mall after it was recommended by a friend. So glad we went. The mall was well kept and clean.

We found ours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msjradennis
