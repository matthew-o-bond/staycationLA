50,The Best outdoor Acoustic amphitheater in the world,The moment one comes into this arena of concerts and such one realizes the magnificent design and quality of the venue itself. The natural acoustics are remarkable and unsurpassed anywhere in the world. Excellent design of seating so that the stage is visual to any and attendees. Storied history and many phenomenal acts over many decades have played this venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonygW9228EC
50,Love the Place,"I live in LA, and Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite rides in LA to take my visitors friends. The drive is along Santa Monica mountains ( actually hills), between what we call the City and the Valley. You can see both areas along the way.

It’s a fun drive up the canyon and you wonder what it’s like to live on the narrow winding road.Be aware that the parking area is tiny! You may have to drive away, turn around, and come back to find a spot. You don’t need long here but it’s a pretty view. I’m sure it’s neat to see at night but, sadly it closes at 6 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahb908

20,It's a great venue but too much POT smoking,It's a great venue but the amount of POT smoking is bad. Because it is outdoor it gives everyone an excuse to light up. I don't have a problem if you want to smoke on your own and happy to have nice friends who smoke but it's something that I choose not to do. This place doesn't give you a choose because every other person is lighting up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TM-Moser
50,Taking the Metro is the biggest kept secret,"The Hollywood bowl is a wonderful piece of LA history and today's entertainers.. The first time we went to the bowl, it was a couple years ago to see Donna Summer. We drove. and it took us 2 hours to get out of the parking lot. It took us a while to go back. Then we found the metro. We park and ride and it's a breeze to getting and out - Hollywood and Highland and take the metro after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/concettah667
50,From the top of the Bowl...,"This picture shows the view from the the very last row of seats at The Hollywood Bowl. From there, even the 4 jumbo TV screens are pretty small. The Stage even smaller, just colors moving a tiny bit which are actually people. The sound is good. There is home just above and the family and their guests are known to come out on the patio and listen to the music as suits them. This is during an evening concert, after dusk. During sunlight afternoons, to the right side of the picture presented here, lies The John Anson Ford Amphitheater. Where concerts are given in the evenings, but because of the hills and geography of the area, it is entered from a completely different direction. The HOLLYWOOD sign is partially visible also form the Bowl Overlook. If you attend a concert, you will notice two crossed search lights in the night sky. A BIG X. This is a warning to all air traffic to remain clear and prevent the aircraft engine noise from interference with the Bowl concerts beautiful sounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz

The vehicles can exit from the left or right of the row. The parking attendants do a very good job of lining the vehicles up in each row. The sections and rows are all numbered. The entrance to the Hollywood Bowl is ground and there is a moderate up hill walk to the entrance. There is an escalator part of the way near the entrance. There are restrooms, restaurant and shops a long the way. The box seating area is nearest to the stage. The opened seating area is above the box seating all the way to the top of the bowl. There are only steps and aisles to the top of the bowl. The lights on the towers around the bowl brightens the stage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/George700East
50,"Great views, busy","The best lookout along Mulholland Drive gets lots of tour groups that crowd the small carpark - and surrounding parts of the street have no parking signs despite having lots of space at the side. If you get in, it’s worth it, with the bowl and Hollywood leading out to the city plus a good view of the sign in the other direction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom

40,Great views but a little crowded here.,The views are great but the parking is limited so if the lot is full it is best to come back later. Parking around the overlook can be difficult and dangerous so the lot is recommended. There are not toilet facilities there but it is a nice short stop while on Mulholland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
40,Amazing View,Wish we had gone to a concert here. Such a great venue for one. It was nice to walk around and see the Holywood bowl and the little museum there.

50,Surprising place,"I love visiting here when there is no entertainment, The locals use it for doing fitness.

Even the Hollywood strip, Universal Studios, Fashion district of LA,......tons of stuff to see....go do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
40,Better to see a concert in the Bowl!,"Not sure about the ""overlook"" since I've never gone to use it before, but it's definitely worth the hassle to see a concert in the Hollywood Bowl itself. Parking is a pain and you have to go through airport style metal detectors to see a concert these days, yet the Hollywood Bowl is one of the best venues in L.A. to see concerts, especially outdoors during the summer months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,There is nothing in the world like the Hollywood Bowl,Music under the stars in this 1030's Bowl is LA iconic. No other place in the word can compare. Bring your own picnic basket and get there early. No matter who the entertainment many be it will be great under the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598ede
40,Went here for a gig,Great experience seeing a gig here. So relaxed. Its great that people can take in their own food and drinks. People were having picnics before going to their seats. Its an all seated outdoor venue. There is also a lot of food outlets if you want to but food and lots of choice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108
50,Fall concert Florence and the Machine,"There is something surreal about a concert where the moon and stars and city lights are your backdrop. The venue was packed and parking is not worth trying unless you are a resident and know all the tricks. Definitely recommend the shuttle! You can pack your own food but there are plenty of places to eat inside (some area bit pricey). Get a cushion and bring something to keep you warm. Concert was amazing and the venue perfect. Getting in and out, taking the shuttle was no problem at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelle5363
40,Amazing views!,"This lookout is absolutely incredible, and I'd rate it 5-stars if there was more parking available, as well as clearer views. We visited on a Saturday morning, the day after the Beck concert at the Hollywood Bowl. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a proper parking spot. The parking area is very small and can fill up fast, so it's best to arrive early. It was awesome to see the bowl from two perspectives - attending a show at the bowl and then viewing it empty from above. Amazing! In addition to the bowl, you can see the surrounding area off in the distance, including Hollywood and downtown LA. Well, you can sort of see it. The views would be so much better without the heavy smog. Too bad LA is such a polluted place. It could be gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdgrl79
30,Good view IF you can climb lots of stairs,"My wife & I took our cousin (who lives south of L.A.) to this overlook (the Jerome C. Daniel Overlook on Mulholland Drive) to take some photos of the Hollywood sign, and snap a few shots of the downtown L.A. skyline. Very hot the day we visited, and parking lot was full (waited 20 minutes behind cars in line for a very few spaces...about 6 or 7 total spots).Finally snagged a handicapped space (yes, we have a handicapped placard in our car), and got out to take some shots. Great views at lower level of downtown L.A., and the seating area of the Hollywood Bowl, but to see the actual ""Hollywood"" sign, you must climb a LONG set of stairs to the top of the peak (steep & narrow steps with few landings), so my wife who uses a rollator could not go to the top. I climbed the steps & took some shots for her, but she was disappointed that there was no way for her to get to the top observation platform except by those MANY steps.On our way out of the parking area, we looked to our right towards the downward slope of Mulholland Drive, & THERE IT WAS...the Hollywood Sign! We got my wife out of the car, took a few photos, & got back in for our descent down to the freeway on Mulholland. At least we managed to get a few shots (partially obscured by undergrowth, though) of the Hollywood Sign with my wife in the picture.If you go, wear comfortable shoes & a hat (sun is brutal in summer), and BE PREPARED to CLIMB MANY STEPS...this is definitely not for folks who (like my wife) who are movement impaired. Surprised that the State of California has not seen fit to make this park truly handicapped accessible (except for ONE parking spot)...is the A.D.A. not applicable here??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastcheapandeasy2014
50,Amazing Setting coupled w/ a Warm LA Night!,"I saw Dave Mathews play - first of all Dave Mathews was nothing but amazing, but then you add on the venue of Hollywood Bowl, and it really makes for a special quintessential LA evening! The venue is wonderful, the backdrop is an LA sunset as it goes from a blend of reds, pinks, purples and oranges, to a deep black. You appreciate LA's warm nights as the band plays. The food that you can order is heathy and good, although the wait staff disappears, and you never see them again (they are really missing out on a business opportunity!). Great venue, and a must see if you are visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondraw221
50,Great Venue,"This venue is wonderful. I've been there a couple of times & have been really happy with everything except the parking. Don't drive there. Park at the bus area & take one of their shuttles, it's cheap & easy. Otherwise you will waste any extra 2-3 hours with parking. Trust me it's not worth it. If you like wine, go early and bring your own picnic basket with blanket. You can drink your wine & eat before the show with your friends. though this will be outside the venue before you get in. People just sit everywhere and anywhere. If it's raining don't bring an umbrella, you can't bring them in. Plus you will need to print out your tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natural1sumr
50,Great View,"The view from the Hollywood Bowl is breathtaking.If you have a chance to visit, be sure to take a camera with you.Stand in the back row and see and photograph the seating area and the stage.Make sure you get the Hollywood Sign after that.By the way, this is a GREAT place for concerts.I love it.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
50,May the Force be with you!,"Hadn't been to the Hollywood Bowl in over ten yrs. But by going with someone who knows the route, parking locations and seats, our evening was perfect.With the orchestra playing the entire sound track in sync with the film action and a promotional item of a Light Saber to wave when the action called for it, it was both fun and beautiful outside. No need for even a light wrap as the weather was just right.Constant clearing of trash bags and removable tables in the box seat areas was amazing and the movie Star Wars, A New Hope made in 1977 was even better knowing what happens in the future movies.Incredible sound track and an audience that came to have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz

50,Great place to see the Hollywood sign and city!!,"I actually used this spot to see the Hollywood sign and was beyond blown away with the views. Be advised that you should be a confident driver since the road, which is about a mile up or so, is extremely windy and narrow (for me anyway).Once I reached the overlook I was in total awe of the view. You have the perfect view of the Hollywood sign along with amazing views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virginiam679
50,Terrific Location.,"I wanted to leave a review for the Hollywood Bowl, the summer concert venue. I see there are some reviews here for the Bowl, for concert goers. The title here says “overlook”...so I believe this listing is about the view. The Bowl is a county park and you are allowed to enter after 8am to have a look around the amphitheater. If you walk up to the third tier, you’ll have the best photo opportunity. You can see the Hollywood Sign above the amphitheater. Tour groups come in have a look and the guides never tell their audience to walk up three levels. I know because for years I used to exercise with my dog in the Bowl, and I watched groups come in often. There are picnic areas all over the Bowl grounds. And for summer concerts, it a great activity where you don’t necessarily have to pay a ton of money for tickets to enjoy yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,A very old school LA experience,"Take a picnic for pre-show dining and enjoy the glorious weather. The headliners are usually not the A-list these days, but a night under the stars with friends makes it completely worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaPeery
40,Be prepared,"This venue is well worth a visit, great location, the sound has been good and there are enough screens to ensure you don’t miss a thing. Pick up a cushion on your way in as the seats can be hard. Other facts you should be aware of; Parking is a nightmare so don’t even think about it, take public transport, bus Uber etc. After an event you are better off waiting in your seat for at least 20 minutes (really) before walking down to an incredible traffic jam, however if you are patient enough, get yourself a hotdog from a street vendor and walk about 1.5 km to Hollywood boulevard where you can get a Uber straight away. NOTE; Often you are allowed to take food, alcohol etc in (picnic) and eat on the premises and even take it into the concert area, however this last time they did not so everyone ate and drank b4 going in. Check website for each event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goretti_13
40,Great place for the Fourth of July Festivities,This is a fun place to bring the kids for a concert and a fireworks show on 4th of July. We do it every year and find it a fun alternative to other expensive options. You can bring your own picnic and some people even bring their own drinks.It's a good idea to bring your stadium padding since the seating is not too comfy after the first hour or two.

40,its the wild west up here...,"there was quite a few injuries that required an ambulance to show up and ems to treat on-scene... with that being said when the issues start happening it locks up the grass areas, the police/security close off the sides and monitor the whole thing not allowing anytihgn else to happen which is good, its great in fact! however when you paid for a ticket to have a good time and you cant get a refill or go to the bathroom for a half hour or your kid is screaming hungry; they dont budge on case by case, its a nogo zone. so keep that in mind as you click the cheaper ticket option",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milvetmac

Nowadays, there are police posted here on nights when the Bowl is happening but I used to love to stop and listen to the music wafting up to the overlook. The view, in winter, is stunning.

20,Nice To See It.. and That's About It,We passed the Hollywood Bowl every day as it lay between our hotel and Hollywood Boulevard.It is great to get a glimpse of this famous venue and the view is pretty good from an elevated lookout point. But at the end of the day it's an empty theatre and that's about all there is to it. I was pretty surprised to see it even come up on this site as an attraction to be honest.Now if there was a performance on it would be a different matter... though I very much doubt you'd be allowed to simply stand here and look in on it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bozeman-Dublin

40,Old school since 1922,I am torn between giving this place a great or bad review but what do you expect when going to any sold out venue at this place. I've been here several times over the years and it's always a mad house getting in and out of this venue. Sometimes we will take the Pasadena shuttle to avoid the parking nightmare and the traffic. I always try to tail gate party before going in because two things the liquor is overpriced and the lines are long.

The tickets range from very affordable (far away from stage but they have Jumbotron tvs) to very expensive - and you can bring in your own food and drink (although they sell a wide diversity of food at expensive prices inside).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveDCA

The trail opens up some additional views towards downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDcine

50,Brilliant night.,On holiday from the UK. We read the reviews and as a result opted for park and ride. We paid at the bus on the night so $12 per head return instead of 7 but so worth it as the bus dropped us right at the venue...no fuss or stress. Last minute decision to go so we also got tickets on the night from the box office (I appreciate not possible with some concerts). We sat in $12 seats section Q but view was spectacular regardless. ..in fact I'd recommend the back as it's cheap and you get such a view of the whole arena. Great concert from LA Philharmonic. We shopped ahead and took a picnic that we ate in our seats. We wished we had got there a few hours earlier as some nice spots to eat but all taken when we got there (an hour before) You can definitely bring your own food and drink. Most seemed to though plenty to but at venue but a hot dog was $10.

Sound was outstanding. It is a wonderful way to enjoy world class entertainment. There is not a bad view. There are plenty of viewing screens.There are lots of food choices should you desire to make a purchase there. Souvenirs are available. Lavatories were clean and accessible. The grounds are very well maintained. There are escalators and wheel chair options for those that are physically challenged.Traffic is a nightmare. However, there are specials available to attend via public transportation. We came over from Pasadena via the bus. You are delivered close to the venue. The buses leave 25 minutes after the event which is plenty of time to walk to the pickup location. It is very convenient. The price was under 10. I would avoid driving there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763ajs
40,Movie at Hollywood Bowl,My sister and I had a fantastic time at the Hollywood Bowl. We saw the Raiders of the Lost Ark accompanied by the symphony. What a fantastic location to watch a great movie! We had no issues seeing the movie even though we were seated fairly far back. There were several large screens placed around the stage. The seats were wooden and I felt they were fine but they do rent seat cushions for $1 to make for a more comfortable viewing experience. The setting was beautiful in the Hollywood hills. The symphony did a great job accompanying the movie and sometimes I would forget that the symphony was playing the music because they did a good job with the sound mixing. We parked at the Hollywood and Highland parking complex which was a short walk away. I felt that this worked out well. There was quite a crowd to walk back to the car with but we were able to pull out of the parking garage quickly. Might be more expensive than other places but it was easy for out of towners to figure out. If not wanting to walk I read that there was a shuttle but I would guess that would involve a lot more waiting. I would definitely recommend going to an event here if you have the chance. So glad I did this during my visit to LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistweave
40,"Nice venue, but traffic is an issue","We went there for Lionel Richie's concert, with Mariah Carey as special guest. Although valet parking cost $50, it provided us the convenience of walking just a few steps to the entry gate. That was important especially at the end of the concert when everybody was leaving the venue at 11 p.m. Traffic was really bad before and after the concert. Overall, it was a good experience to be at the Hollywood Bowl for a concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaPei
40,Fantastic,"This is a definite must if you are staying for a few nights. We saw the musical Mama Mia with Jennifer Nettles and Cordon Blue. Jennifer was great. Her supporting actresses were just as impressive. If you go, I would recommend bringing food, a seat cushion and buy the valet parking pass. It's expensive, but worth it because at the end of the show about 5 thousand people walk to the shuttle buses that take them to the remote parking lots and we walked to our valet parked car and drove off before the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Victoria652
50,Hollywood Bowl,This is my favorite music venue. I love this place. Getting there is a nightmare - LA traffic and the 101 suck...but HB is still totally worth it - HB is my favorite place in Southern California,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferlF6493RU
50,Great venue!!!,We went to see a concert right before the 4th of July. The fireworks were amazing!! Our mistake was not finding out what you could bring in. The concert we went to you could bring in picnic baskets and your own alcohol!!! The alcohol was expensive!! Regret that we didn't check on that before the concert! Definitely would go to another concert there!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretchenm3
50,Mamma Mia,"We were lucky to be in LA when Mamma Mia was playing at the Hollywood Bowl just for the weekend. This is a fantastic, open air, amphitheater. The acoustics are incredible and the numerous screens make sure that everyone in the Bowl can see exactly what is happening on stage. It seats close to 20 thousand people! So it is massive!There is a souvenir shop and numerous stalls for food and snacks. You are also allowed to bring your own snacks, cushions and blankets (depending on how much you spent your seat ticket).It was a bit of an uphill walk to get to it, and getting out took a while as thousands of people dispersed. The parking and the taxi and Uber pick up was also a bit far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbyUmer
50,Every seat is under the stars! Take a bus in.,"Even in the summer heat, all the shows here are so enjoyable. Everyone has carried in a sack of food and drinks to enjoy the various shows. Music sounds wonderful here, movies with orchestra are great too! There are escalators, but plenty of inclines to traverse if you are sitting farther up. Still worth the trek. If you don't bring food, there are still plenty of options on site. Bathrooms are in good order too.The biggest challenge is likely parking. We have found it is much easier to find a satellite bus location to park, and get bused in. There is no delay getting out as the buses have priority.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieB2304
40,Amazing concerts,I love this place! You can pass a great and fun afternoon sharing with friends under the stars the concerts that they usual have. You can take your own food and drinks. The premiere outdoor venue in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julioaliaga
40,Great experience,"I love the place, I thought it was smaller but actually it is huge. I love the surroundings where people can picnic, I like the acoustics of the place, and the view is great, you can even see teh Hollywood sign in the distance. Also I see people were bringing their bottle of wine, which is a no-noelsewhere, that is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sagittarius111
50,A Pause from Los Angeles,"If you can watch a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, do it! I recently saw Jack Johnson at the Hollywood Bowl. When you're sitting in the venue, it feels like you're pausing all of the Los Angeles noise outside to listen to whoever is performing. You can only see the hills surrounding the stage, which to me says it's time to listen and enjoy the music rather that he hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. I sat in section J, which is basically in the dead center of the bowl. I would book section J again.The Hollywood Bowl lets you bring food and beverages in to enjoy with the concert. I wish I would have known this ahead of time because my husband and I ended up purchasing food and wine from vendors inside. It was quite pricey. So, bring your own if you can and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingjamie
50,"Steep climb by car, a little scary but definitely worth the effort!","The Hollywood Bowl overlook is not easy to navigate to, but quite worth the trip when you get there, and Mulholland Drive provides a beautiful scene of it's own!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953AnneG953
40,Concert venue outdoors,"To experience a concert at the Hollywood Bowl is quite spectacular. Sitting outdoors with thousands of others listening to great music on a beautiful July evening in Southern California. Yes, traffic is a real detriment and the Bowl's stacked parking stinks but we found a small lot on Highland Avenue by the Holiday Inn Express that offered an easy out after the concert. The cost was $20.00. Section J, row 10, seats 16 and 18 are center and perfect !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
50,The Hollywood Bowl,"A must see venue, The Bowl has hosted rock, jazz and classical performers.Having visited in the '60's, '80's and current day, the Bowl never disappoints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zapprint
50,Great venue for summer concerts !,"For summer, they have concerts almost every day and buses that can take you anyway in Southern Los Angeles to the Bowl effortless. The greatest thing is the bus fare is cheap: for $7 round trip, you don't have to worry about parking. Its efficient and you can rest on the bus avoiding all the traffic. Summer time is great time to go to Hollywood bowl- to rest, have a picnic, enjoy the blue sky ( early summer schedule) and wonderful music with thousands of people and even watch some firework if available. But make sure you have a coat or blanket because evening can be cold.We had a great time, don't miss it if you travel to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
50,Great time,We were lucky enough to see Pentatonix here over the 4th of July weekend! A spectacular venue with lots of food choices including delivery to your seats. Would definitely come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pollyv193
50,Pentatonix 4th of July - Outstanding!,"This is a repeat visit on the 4th and it just gets better each year. The Hollywood Bowl is an amazing place to visit! It's spacious, clean and well organized with good staff all around.Pentatonix show is the best, no matter what music genre you like, the sing a little bit of everything. While normally a pure vocal only group thy were also backed by the Hollywood Phil orchestra.They added several patriotic songs and ended with a Queen song that only they could do as well. We will see Pentatonix again and visit the Hollywood Bowl more often",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan
40,A nice view of the city.,The Hollywood Bowl was not what I expected. But it was interesting never the less. You could see for miles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Realty56
50,Very good place to see concerts,"We have been to the Hollywood Bowl a few times for concerts and every seat is great. It does get a little chilly in the evening - I've never been there in the day time but I would bet it gets hot. Plenty of vendors and restaurants with good food, but pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesliek1565
40,Great view but couldnt see hollywood sign well,We stopped off here as part of a tour and it provided a great view of hollywood bowl and la. We walked to the top to see the hollywood sign but it was quite a distance away so couldnt get a great picture. Worth visiting though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heartbelongsinhawaii
50,Great concert venue!,"Went to a concert with friends, & loved the place and atmosphere. Very well organised, with all the usual facilities, food, drinks & clean toilets but spread out so no long lines. It's all sitting with wooden benches so if you have a back problem for ex. I,d recommend u either bring a cushion from home or hire one for $1 just right of the last ticket checkpoint, u may actually need 2!Tickets get cheaper as you go up in the amphitheatre but there are 3 big screens so all good.You may take a picnic basket & include alcohol if you like, but I advise u also take some sort of a tray to place with food on your lap, as there are always late comers trying to get past you.Traffic: very congested near venue, take a uber, then a short walk up hill. On the way out I recommend you take your time exiting & walk up to intersection with Hollywood Blvd b4 getting another Uber, in fact I would advise you to just grab a bite somewhere before returning home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goretti_13
50,Visited as part of a tour,This is cool to look at but was like a 5 minute stop. Enjoyed the drive up and down more. It is a small stop area with like 8 parking spaces. Go off hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lahelsel
40,Great view!,The overlook is a great place to see the Hollywood Sign and the Hollywood Wood. There is very limited parking and a lot of tour buses during the day. It is also a good place to see the city of LA. Be prepared to walk up steps. Bring binoculars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ustravelrt66
50,Hollywood bowl place to be and see,"It was nice, as I couldn't go and see Hollywood sign so from Hollywood bowl i could actually see sign from top and near by museum was awesome , place to visit . Short trip famous place to visit .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abbukarki
40,Great views,"While this is called the Hollywood Bowl Overlook, keep in mind that you are looking at the back of the Hollywood Bowl. However, you do have a view of the Hollywood Sign and LA. There is very limited parking and a lot of tour buses also stop there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmaier1969
50,Easy to find with a great view,"Sometimes it takes some hunting to find the location you are looking for but not here, it's well marked and there isn't a bad view. Climb the short amount of steps for a little higher view or stand where the parking lot is and bask in the sun as you view the city from your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethW1548
50,GREAT VENUE,"Was treated to a show by my twin sister, gosh a year ago now. Saw BB King and what an entertainer? Incredible talent and energy of his age. He did use the chair on stage for most of the show but then so would `I at that age. Truly recommend at least one visit if in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/recycled-rockandroll
50,Catch a Concert at the Bowl,Good acoustics and an open air setting make the Hollywood Bowl a fun attraction. There are several concerts a year that are geared for varying tastes in music with some that include a fireworks show finale. Treat yourself to the tables in the front with dinner and wine for the LA DE DA experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HT909
50,Amazing views,This was part of the 2 hour tour and wow the views over Los Angeles were amazing.There is a small carpark then you can walk up about 70 steps to a small platform type are where you could see right over the Hollywood bowl and a great view of the Hollywood sign too!Worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonreid66
40,try to get there earl in the day - very small parking lot,"I drive past here with visitors in the car - if there is parking, I pull over and we climb to the top and enjoy the views = stunning - it has become more and more popular over the years with tour vans/tourists and parking can be impossible - go early - avoid sunset unless you're being dropped off and collected!!!The view will give you a great sense of how sprawling and monstrous LA is...you are directly over the Hollywood Bowl - on a rare day - you can see the Pacific Ocean glinting in the far distance....Worth checking out if you're on Mulholland - and the drive itself is very fun and my favorite short cut in the summer during rush hour traffic while someone is performing at Hollywood Bowl!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806

50,Drive along Mulholland,"What a great free thing to do. And you get to experience the winding drive along the famous Mulholland en route.I believe it's open sunrise to sunset.There are only a few parking spots. I think I've ready that you can park on the street, Mulholland, but I didn't feel good about leaving a rental on the shoulder of a winding road.I think the reviews here are a bit mixed up between the Overlook vs. the actual Hollywood Bowl. There are two different sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/product-of-canada
50,Beautiful to see!,Perfect pull-over spot to see the whole area. Beautiful with added bonus of Hollywood sign in the opposite view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapergal2017
50,LA LA LAND Views,"This is a great place for views similar to those you see from Griffith Park (Where La La Land was filmed), especially at night. Griffith Park can get frustratingly congested on summer evenings, but the view from here is equal. A few miles further west on Mulholland Dr is another view of the San Fernando Valley, which is another quintessential Los Angeles view of the boulevard grid. I always take people from out of town to see this marvel of the built world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJHappyTraveler
40,Quite a view,"There are several excellent overlooks along Mulholland drive, but this one gives you a unique view over the Hollywood Bowl and farther east towards the downtown skyline. Worth a stop if you're driving along Mulholland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestwoodTrekker
40,Beautiful view over the city,From Hollywood Bowl Overlook you can have beautiful vista over Los Angeles. You can have a shot of LA Downtown in the horizon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrosenbergh
50,A much overlooked gem in Hollywood,"This venue is a much overlooked (seasonal) Hollywood destination where you can enjoy a picnic as you listen to great music. Cost range is OUCH! (for a box if you can get one through a broker) to wow! only a few bucks for the cheap seats! Classical, pop and jazz music depending on the night. When they speak of ""The Bowl"" it's the micro-climate of the landscape, not the bandshell, something magical about it not to be missed whether you spring for a box or the cheap seats. Car parking is ""unusual"", busses are available, check on-line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendor818
10,Worst Venue Ever,"I know it's a classic & old venue in LA, but oh my goodness its the WORST. Basically parking is a disaster with cars piled on tops of each other for $20 each, second it's a nightmare to leave/enter due to traffic on show days. Third, if you're not front row you basically cant see anything and the acoustics are terrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schar108
50,Great vistas,This is a great spot to get a good view of the Hollywood sign and the city. We were staying close by and went at night and then again in the morning. Beautiful. There are only about 6 parking spots so I can see it being quite crowded at times. Definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ipassgas

50,Awesomeness,"The drive up the narrow Mullholland Dr. is well worth it: This overlook offers a close to complete view of the entire Los Angeles area, and it is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thunderberg
50,"Lovely views, even without the sign","It's a very nice, serene little spot that feels removed from the tangle of traffic below, although it's unfortunately small with extremely limited parking due to its hillside location. The Hollywood sign was completely obscured by fog when I visited, which I gather happens relatively often, though the view of the city and surrounding hills was still quite nice. Take note that the stairs leading up to the viewpoint can be fairly muddy after it rains, so pay attention to where you step.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThePathLessTravelled
40,Nice place for a concert,"Visited while on a Hollywood tour. Very nice amphitheatre. Here is where many orchestra performances are held in LA. Also, summer concerts and music festivals such as the pop music wango tango. We viewed from the hills. Looks like it would be a nice place to experience during a warm summer evening some musical talent while in LA or SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
40,Fabulous View,"This place certainly proves the adage that the best things in life are free. I was in LA with my family and we took a drive to this point.

40,"Splendid views from the overlook, but small on-site parking","The Jerome C. Daniel Overlook above the Hollywood Bowl off Mulholland Drive is a popular stop for locals and tourists for photos of Downtown Los Angeles skyline, Griffith Park, and the iconic ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign. However, the on-site parking is very small and fills up very quickly (one car leaves, another takes its space immediately thereafter), leading to cars being illegally parked along Mulholland Drive, even if it's only for a quick stop. Probably better if accessed via LA City Tours bus (Hop On, Hop Off), which makes a stop at the overlook.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akisaurus
50,great view,Very nice overlook! If you have car you can stop there and than go via Mulholland drive to Beverly Hills. It is a very nice route.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piotrh1982
50,Best view in the city,The view from the Bowl Overlook is the best in the city. Get there early as there is little parking and it fills up fast. It closes fairly early but if you can get there for a night view its totally worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsmed

40,"A bit far from the Hollywood sign for pictures, but and easy spot to drive to for the view. On Mulholland Drive.",This satiated the kids need to have a pic with the hollywood sign. They were happy! And the drive on Mulholland affords nice views all the way toward Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525alisonn
50,The best outlook and pic opportunity for the hollywood sign,busy but possible. amazing views across los angeles and of course the hollywood sign. spend 10-15 mins here then move on.. let others in. some amazing house perched on the cliffs... who lives in a house like that?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tartant2016
40,Great view,Wasn't to the overlook to get a great view of the Hollywood sign. There are only about 10 parking bays and during the day the parking gets full of sightseeing minibuses. There is one disabled bay available. There are 20+ steps up to the main viewing area but the view is great. The drive along Mullholland Drive is spectacular too. You can also see the Hollywood Bowl from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bms17v
30,Iconic Concert Venue,"The Hollywood Bowl is such an iconic place. It's great to attend a concert there, but it requires a lot of planning - e.g. special buses, pack lunch at (Whole Foods) and be able to wander around. Driving by on Mulholland Drive can also provide a view of the iconic landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari0nP
50,Amazing view,"We were wandering around exploring and came across this spot on the internet when I said I wanted to go to mulholland drive and decided to go here. You will not be disappointed!

Definitely go up there and enjoy the view if you're thinking of going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyliesue91
50,Beautiful views,"Beautiful view, not only of the Hollywood bowl but also LA, and the Hollywood sign. Very peaceful. We were there really early in the morning only a couple of other cars there.

Perfect view - especially since we didn't get to go into the Hollywood Bowl this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonya
50,amazing venue,"Having never been here before, I was taken aback by the sheer size of the place. I've been to many venues of all different sizes, but this place is special. It is an amazing place to see a concert. We were there to see The Nightmare Before Christmas performance and had seats in section K1. The sound is amazing! Sometimes in outside venues, the sound gets lost, but not here. Don't worry about not being able to see the stage clearly if you have seats towards the back, there are plenty of large, clear video screens to help you. I hope to be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fergll

50,Great experience!,"This was first time to the Hollywood Bowl. I went with a couple of friends to the Nightmare Before Christmas live performance with Danny Elfman. We paid extra for ""Garden seats"" and it was fantastic. I had no idea how huge the place was but it was packed. Great performance as well as great experience. I didn't have any issues and all staff were nice although they do try to rush you out after the show. Overall, great time and very lovely concert venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WickedCakes
50,Excellent Concert at the Hollywood Bowl,"We attended the We Can Survive concert where there were several performers. The sound, the lights, and the atmosphere are the best I have been to. The experience was amazing. To see the Bowl was pretty spectacular in and of itself, but the atmosphere with a concert...beyond amazing and well worth the money to experience. They did an awesome job and the firework display post concert was worth staying extra for. I was worried about getting that many people out of the Bowl...but seemed to flow smoothly considering the amount of people in attendance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8868YLwendyl
50,This is a great stop...,"As part of exploring the hills, made a point of stopping here. The view of the Bowl is worth it alone, but if you wander off the trail along a ridge-line you will get great views of Downtown L.A. and the freeway.

40,"Great for concerts, not the best for parking","Just saw Black Sabbath play there. Nice amphitheater. Lots of vendors selling shirts, food and drinks. Great experience at the venue. The parking on the other hand is a pain. Due to stacked parking you can't get out unless the people around you leave. That's why I can't give it a 5 star. Otherwise it's a fun venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IronMerMayden

50,BLEW me AWAY!!!!,"I have been to numerous concerts at hundreds of venues in my 50 years, some seriously amazing places. This was an out of body experience!!! Came just to see my all time favorite group ELO and it did not disappoint. The fact that we upgraded to box seats really made it even more fun. We enjoyed a picnic dinner with our friends before the show. I can not say enough about ELO!! There is a reason they only came to two places in America for their reunion tour. The Hollywood Bowl was ideal for the lazer light and firework display. They were accompanied by the Hollywood Bowl Symphony. It was truly a remarkable experience and a superb venue! I guess you can compare it to a Red Rocks Amphitheater on steroids! If you love outdoor concerts, you must add this place to your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gracelovesme13
50,Spaceship ELO!,"Came here after some pressure from my Hollywood resident friend, to see a band that i'd class as before my time...but they (ELO) and the LA Philharmonic and the venue itself were AMAZING! You can take your own food and drink..I think its actually a tradition to do that...which is unheard of at most venues, and from where we sat (mid level) the experience (orchestra, ELO and fireworks) was second to none.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonQ144

40,ELO at the BOWL,"Terrific venue for a concert! We parked at a public lot off of Hollywood Blvd, had dinner, and walked about a mile to the venue. Pretty easy walk up to the bowl. Note...don't park at the bowl if you don't want to get stuck in the parking lot. Easy to get trapped given the way that cars are parked nose to tail. We had a picnic at the bowl and were able to bring in a couple of bottles of wine (awesome! Who does that anywhere else?) Rent some cushions ($1) as the seats are wood benches (at least where we sat). Section N...dead center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjd496
50,Wow,We saw ELO on the weekend here. And even if we were high up in the stands the sound and the view was nothing short of spectacular. The amenities here are much better than the Santa Barbara bowl that we recently visited as well. You're still dealing with a large crow as this venue holds 18 K people and this particular show was sold out but at least there are escalators to get to the top. The setting is just out of this world and the philharmonic orchestra backing up the band and the fireworks at the final song was just icing on the cake. An unforgettable evening !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radar60
40,Great for any concert,"One of Los Angeles' best attractions for any concert. Outdoors, great music, great sound, and if you pick a show with them - fun fireworks. If you are far from the stage there are TV screens to see up close. The amphitheater allows for light shows which add to the fun. Be sure to bring a sweater or jacket. Beware the bench seats are very cozy. If you have a picnic get there 3 hours before for a good spot. Expect to see or run into people you have imbibed a lot at rock concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnU162
30,You get to see the sign,It's an ok spot to see the sign just super crowded and smells of urine. Definitely could use a bigger parking area to park at. I personally would find a better spot to look at the sign and view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124allyh
50,One of the best things about summer in LA,"My husband and I have been attending events at the Hollywood Bowl for over 15 years. We typically go 5+ times a season depending upon which artists are on the calendar. It is lovely to sit outside and listen to great music. You can bring a picnic dinner into the venue including wine, beer or other alcohol. There are lots of picnic tables and places to sit or you can also picnic in your seat. There are also food / drink options on site. Be aware that if the concert is a lease event ( not on the official HB calendar) you can not bring alcohol into the venue but can still sit in a picnic area outside the venue proper.Most of the seats are wooden benches so rent or bring s seat cushion. There is one section of plastic bucket seats.Tickets go on sale around the first of May so for the best seats buy them early.They offer a wide range of music options. Everything from classical with a full orchestra to jazz to rock. There are large video screens so you can see the performers even if sitting toward the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkshaefer
50,A must do stop for visitors,Great view into downtown LA as well as viewing the Hollywood Bowl venue. Our Australian guests were quite impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG107
50,A wonderful stop on the drive along Mulholland Drive,"I drove along the length of Mulholland Drive and on to Hollywood Reservoir for a walk (separate review).This stop was busy, but a great look out.Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Night fairytale,"Go there by night. It's absolutely incredible how beautiful something can be. All city is sparkling and if you're lucky you can hear a sound coming from Hollywood Bowl, romantic or a great place to fix your thoughts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alisoone
40,Great Views,"Great views on three sides of: the Hollywood sign, downtown LA and the Hollywood Bowl. All the tours stop here so the little parking lot can get pretty congested (most people park on the side of the street) but worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garysC35UR
50,The perfect spot for city views,"In this little park you can get one of the best views of downtown Los Angeles. Also, you get a decent view of Hollywood sign. I drove to this park. It was crowded, so almost no parking space, but you can park on the side of the road for a few minutes. Bring a good camera, so you can get good selfies. Or just enjoy the moment with the view. Totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8047NGdanielc
40,Brought family,Had family in town and of course we had to make a stop here :) Wish the view would've been a bit better. Such a great view anyway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826kareyw
50,Fantastic is an understatement.,This is a great spot to see Los Angeles in its ultimate splendor. A must drive just to take part of the day to do something relaxing. Take many photos and just take it in. My young girls found it fun taking selfies and only costs gas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
50,Magnificent structure,It was incredible to see this structure from the Lookout. It would be fantastic to visit by night when there is a concert on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaysI7849ER
50,Made the trip to Hollywood worthwhile,After a disappointing visit to the walk of fame this made everything better. Not much parking but amazing views of LA that you will have seen in the movies including the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darenl54
50,The View,It's one of those great viewing areas.When you visit LA you should plan which views you want because it requires driving time.Co-ordinate this and where you're going to view the sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
50,You know it.'s fun in the afternoons also,Most people just take advantage of the bowl during the summer/ concert seasons but us locals know that is can also be a great afternoon free music picnic. If you have manners and can be respectful of the artist that practice a the bowl one can go and listen to some music and enjoy the grounds within reason of course. Aside from that it's great for an evening of good food great music and fun company! That is if one sits all the way at the top!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
40,An almost complete scenery of Los Angeles,"One of some interesting stops on Mulholland Drive (with Universal City overlook for the Valley side) to capture an almost complete scenery of Los Angeles, from the Hollywood sign, the Observatory, the Hollywood Bowl, Downtown and Catalina Island (with good weather and binocular). You get everything in in your hand and camera, including some interesting architectural houses on Macapa drive and Outpost. You'll also get the sense of the diversity of this big city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedSkirrel
50,"Perfect views of Hollywood Bowl, LA & the Hollywood sign, tough parking","Don't miss this free park. We visited this overlook several times on our trip. You won't find a better spot to see the majority of LA, the Hollywood sign and the bowl. There is a stone staircase to walk up to have optimal views, and perfect selfie locations. The parking is tough and minimal, and the tour guides take every group there. So it's always crowded, but it's something you won't want to miss on a visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_recruiter
50,Amazing view of the city,"Once you up there, the scenary is breathtaking! You can see the Hollywood sign far away and the view you get of the city is beautiful. Near it is the beautiful house of Erick Morillo. If you go to LA, make sure you visit the Bowl Overlook. You will not regret at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaNgr1
10,Boring,Make sure to go here when something is going on. Just visiting without scheduled activities is redundant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_Wolf_Bek
40,Wonderful!,"We discovered that Paul Simon was playing here the day after we arrived and were lucky enough to manage to get some tickets. The atmosphere and sound quality here have to be felt and heard to be believed and the view is wondferful, but if you're only going to look around, make sure it's a smogless day, otherwise you won't see much. If you're going to an event, leave the car at home or near to a station on the red metro line. Get off at Hollywood Highland and either walk up to the site or get the free shuttle they often offer (you have to show your ticket to the driver), otherwise the traffic jams and parking scrummage are horrendous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheReedies
40,See the Ocean,"The parking is very difficult, but the inconvenience is worth the views. We were there on a clear day and you could see Catalina Island. See the whole LA basin on a smogless day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josemartinez3171
50,I made it to Hollywood!!,"I loved looking at the Hollywood Bowl, I have always wanted to see this. I recommend this to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmae682
40,Good view,This site had a good view. The vehicle had to park along the road and we had to walk along the road with the traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auntylene
50,Fantastic Views of the City,"This is the second best vantage point for the Hollywood sign in the city and gives great views of downtown L.A. below with the iconic view of the 101 freeway snaking toward downtown.Most of the Hollywood tour vans stop in here, so the small parking lot can fill up in a hurry. A lot of people have to park in the shoulder of Mulholland.There are several stairs to get to the viewing point at the top, but for those who can't handle the stairs, the views from the parking lot level are nearly just as spectacular. If you do walk to the top, be sure to step away from the crowded viewing point built there and walk down the trail a bit toward the Hollywood Bowl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1badgmc
40,Fantastic,"This overlook is a great way to see what the Bowl is all about as well as great views of the city. On one side you see the Bowl and the city all the way to the beach, a trek up a few steps and you get a great view of the Hollywood sign. Really pretty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347SandraM
50,Musica,The Hollywood bowl is fun if you would like to see a concert. Make sure you check their website to see their schedule.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreTheFoodie
50,My favorite place in LA!,"The Hollywood Bowl is one of those places that is magical. You can picnic in your box before the concert starts, and listen to world class music in your special seats. I've been a box holder for more than 20 years! A must visit place when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarabV7441KC
40,Stop on the tour,"We took one of the Hollywood tours and they stopped at the Hollywood Bowl overlook. Great views of LA, Capitol Records building and a few other cool things. Nice pictures with pretty cool background...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyrU1046VH
40,Nice views,Make sure that the smog isn't too thick or the views won't be great. Traffic gets bad in the afternoon so go earlier in the day. The Hollywood bowl looks smaller that I thought it was but then again the overlook is a distance away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampersNH
30,Interesting outdoor amphitheater,The Hollywood Bowl is one of the iconic Los Angeles facilities. It is a very large outdoor amphitheater that is used for all types of (mostly musical) events. If you have the time it is an interesting place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Best view at night,"This was the best place to get a great view of all of LA during a clear day and at night. Amazing views, you can see all the way to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKE95
50,"Great view over the bowl, the city, and the Hollywood sign","We visited the overlook on one of the bus tours we jumped on from Hollywood Blvd. We weren't going to do a tour, as we didn't think it was our thing. It totally was! We got to see so much in two hours. A definite recommend. Go early (9am ish) when its quiet... we got a big discount for not really wanting to go and they needed bums on seats! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lissy2904
50,Must not miss attraction,The overlook is always a place to take people visiting LA. Many photo opportunities and you may be inspired to visit the box office to purchase tickets for a performance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daleo170
50,Very nice venue,"We saw Liza Minnelli there in 2015! It was great fun. We brought our own snacks. It was a beautiful night and I found it very enjoyable. Since it is so big, I would try to get tickets in the lower sections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bethlinda
50,Great spot!,Just happened to drive by and decided to stop and have a look. Even luckier was that we got to listen to the the LA Philharmonic rehearse! A free concert!!! Would definitely recommend it! You can wander around and figure out where you want to sit for when you book your tickets for your next show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iyeh

40,Good view of L.A.,"Easy to get to, very little parking (we were lucky to beat the crowd one morning), and it was quite windy when we went (it happened to be both chilly and windy that day!). Great view to see the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles, and beyond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20854Dave_K
40,Where the Beatles played,We were in town exploring and stopped by the Hollywood Bowl to walk around the grounds.We walked up the hillside to get a terrific view of the stage area. Knowing so many famous concerts were held here (especially the Beatles) made it a fun discovery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ct-cruisers
50,Iconic spot that really delivers,"My first time to the Hollywood Bowl was quite a treat. We bussed in from Long Beach and it was easy peasy to jump off the bus and head into the venue. Grace Jones was the performer that night and OMG, if you ever get a chance to see her.. you must! She had quite an elaborate set & costume change routine and the Bowl stage seemed to handle it well. It was the night of the lunar eclipse so the views all around were amazeballs.Most importantly -the bathrooms were clean and easy to get to so I didn't feel like I missed half the concert by trekking to go potty. Yes, I said it's important and yes, I say ""potty""Overall, great place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miavoss
50,"The One, The Only Hollywood Bowl","Ok, I must admit that I am a bit bias with this review, as I produced a concert their May 1, 1971. It is a magnificent venue that is wonderful to just be there no matte who is performing. There is only one negative - The parking is an issue if you need to escape early because it is stacked parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryFleishman
50,Great Place For Tourists,This is a great place to take out of towners. You get a wonderful view of the whole city. You can also see the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Park Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jet7777
50,Great View of Great Amphitheatre,I can walk here from one of my homes. The biggest regret I have is that I hardly every go to the Bowl now I live that close. Wonderful music in the summer followed by massive fireworks. Another LA must experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/what666
50,Hollywood Bowl Overlook,A great place to take out of town visitors on a sunny day. Visitors can get a great view of the LA basin and Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jack3294
40,Great venue for summer out door concerts,This is an iconic venue for some great summer out door concerts. Perfect venue to hear some of world's best performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaspard_de_la_nuit
40,Nice views from the overlook,"The Hollywood Bowl Overlook is located almost at the end of Mulholland Drive, quite near the Route 101. The views of Downtown LA and the Hollywood Sign are pretty good from here. There is a small parking down the overlook.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jac-and-Jek
30,Combined view,We saw this when we went up to see the Hollywood sign. Long distance view though. The best thing was the guides description of the history of the events that have been staged there over the years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelvynG463
50,Not as big as it looks on television!,This stop was a lot of fun. We walked around and got to take pictures. I suggest you go to the bathroom. It was very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robrobe
50,A gorgeous view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign~,"If you want to have a beautiful view of the city of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign, take a ride up to the overlook. It is a beautiful park that does require you to be able to climb some stairs to get to the top of the overlook to see the Hollywood sign. The lower part offers a nice view of downtown L.A. and the surrounding area. The upper part gives a pristine view of the Hollywood sign (one of the best places to see the sign close enough for a good photo). The best time of day to get a shot of the surrounding area is early morning during the week in the off season. It was not crowded, there was only 2 other people there at 7:30am. During the sunrise the light casts a red hue to the hills and the sign making for a beautiful photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
40,what a view!,"Was not rally bothered about seeing this ,but I was really glad I went. We had a bit of an history lesson about it came about to build this place which was very interesting. But when you go into this place and see the scale of it, it is truly awesome. I have never seen anything of this size and beauty. It seems this hillside was made for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertpannell
30,Good Vantage Point,"Interesting vantage point from which to view the Hollywood Bowl, but wouldn't be very good for seeing any performances (although we used to climb up through the underbrush before this area was turned into the overlook, and see concerts for free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
40,Great view of LA,This is great place to view LA in the smog. It is quite small and the parking can get busy especially if a coach visits but it is well worth the time to see the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefamilyguy61
40,What a view,"Great view of Hollywood. Hollywood sign and bowl. Nice overlook to take it all in and relax. Not much parking, but if take tour, it's a main stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyE376
50,The Bowl makes me proud of my hometown,"I've gone to the bowl so often I've lost count. Each time the sound is amazing, the staff friendly and the outdoor experience classic So Cal. Call ahead if you have an accessibility issue and your visit to this gigantic amphitheatre is still life changing. A group of us go each year for sure to the Sound of Music Sing-a-Long, Pink Martini, and other varieties of music. Be sure to bring a picnic basket and arrive in plenty of time to avoid traffic, tailgate or get a good table. The box seats have little tables you set up for your dining al fresco delight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryJaneR74
50,Icon,There is nothing better on a summer night than a picnic and a show at the Hollywood Bowl. It is truly a unique experience in an historic landmark. Make sure to buy one of the Super Seats. They are worth the extra cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamie2561
40,Nice Vista point,"A good place to take photographs of the Hollywood bowl, the it does only have a tiny car park, so you might have to park down the road. Great views of not only the Bowl, but also of LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippin1960

50,808's and Heartbreak,"The best place in California to attend a concert!! Park and Ride is convenient for whatever city you are in, every seat has a view. The weather in Cali is the best for outdoor concerts. This vvenue has cheap seats and great seats. A must to see your favorite artist!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodieinNOHO
50,Iconic must-see Hollywood venue during summer concert series or headliner concerts,"As soon as you know your L.A. Visit dates, Go online and look up what summer series concerts and events are scheduled, and buy some tickets!We visited the bowl 3-4 times when we lived in. L.A., and we really enjoyed the vibe of just being there in a place we!d seen 100's of times on tv and in movies. We saw headliner shows as well as the must-see ""the music of johnWilliams"". Give your self plenty of time to get there, But whether you drive or take a taxi, the parking is well organized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiegoCandela
50,"Great View of Hollywood, Downtown and (maybe) Catalina.","Located 1 mile from the 101 Hollywood Freeway, the overlook on Mulholland Drive gives a person views of the Hollywood sign, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, and on a clear day, all the way to the ocean. Best part? It's FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasKen1
50,The best place for live music,"This is the best place for live music. you know a band/artist has made it when they play Hollywood Bowl. The upgrades to the venue are awesome. Parking is tough and leaving is difficult, I suggest adding the Shuttle options when purchasing the tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/698jasonm
50,HB Tips!,"OK, here goes, in no particular order. Use their website well (hollywoodbowl.com). Book in advance. Avoid driving there and the parking jungle. Use a Park-and-Ride, and a shuttle bus. Lots of ups and downs, use comfortable shoes. Dress in anticipation of a chill coming over when the sun goes down. Restaurant there, but bring your own. Nice gift shop if you have the time. Must be seated before the music starts or you will have to wait until music stops (intermission) before they resume seating people again. There are garden seats, box seats and 'super' seats for those with the money (again, use the web). The rest of us sit on bench seats. Bring a cushion and a blanket. Bring snacks and drinks. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden

50,This was a great event,"Saw the ET movie along with the great Hollywood Bowl Orch. It's been several years since I have been here and the place has improved. Sound is better, boxes are better, the food was better. Cannot say enough about how wonderful the music , production and conductor was for this show. ET is a classic movie and top it off with the live version of the score and you are ready for the best.Of course parking is always a scramble but if you are patient, you will get out of the lot eventually.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
30,"Was good, not breathtaking","We drove up Mulholland Drive to get to the overlook. Great views, but very little parking. May want to go early in the morning to catch the sunrise over the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qoom

40,Iconic Venue - Viewed Only,"We visited the Bowl last week to show our 15 year old daughter as one of our many points of interest on a visit to California. We all thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, even in an empty stadium and enjoyed the view of the Hollywood sign from the top of the tiered seating.The security staff on duty (who were preparing for a concert later in the day) were all extremely friendly and accommodating (just stopping short of allowing my husband on stage for a photo opportunity).The Bowl, the rest rooms and the the surrounding area are immaculately clean. Kitchen staff were busy preparing picnics which could be purchased for anyone visiting for the later concert. I had wished we had booked to see a concert there as I imagine the atmosphere would be electric.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Susie00
50,First Timer and Loved It!!,"Wow, Wow, Wow... What can I say... I went with wife and daughter to see ET and the Philharmonic Orchestra. It was an unbelievable experience . I am so jealous that Los Angelinos have a venue like that, that is so cool. It was a perfect night, great temperature, great seats, and great show. The place is really well organized, and I would suggest when going there to go early, take your wine and food, and sit at any of the tables and areas they have available. Make a night of it, its wonderful. We ;bought a bottle of wine, sat back and enjoyed the movie, while the Philharmonic played live, the soundtrack. What a great experience. The only thing better would have been if ET actually had appeared that night at the Hollywood Bowl.We did Uber in and out, and it was fast, and efficient. I highly recommend this venue if you are in LA, well worth the money..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2lifeadventure
10,Don't go after sunset!!,We were watching fireworks at the bowl after Sunset. The overlook is closed after sunset. Six of us were ticketed - $504. Our cars were also ticketed - $66 each x 4 cars. We got the fines thrown out in court but it was a hassle and we still had to pay the parking tickets. This was many years ago but I don't imagine the situation has improved,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814charlesz

50,LA Shimmering!,"This is a magical place, high above the city. Not the easiest park to get into after dark but worth the jump. You would think you would find people partying. Not tonight, just folks sitting quietly holding Hands snuggled up looking over a sea of twinkling lights.On a clear night like tonight you can see the Hollywood sign in the Eastern hills.

40,See the Hollywood bowl and LIVE,"I saw a very good performance of music there with the LA philharmonic. Tick prices seemed high, but all music venues seem to charge as much for symphony performances. The seats were far, but the sound was crisp and clear. With binocs, one could see well enough on the stage. It is possible to get tickets on the night of performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tortuga_gente
50,Not So Secret Anymore!,This was once upon a time my secret spot. I recently took some out of town friends here and was shocked and saddened to see tour busses and vans !!!! This spot is apparently on the itinerary for tours of Hollywood. It is a one of a kind view though. On a rare clear day here you can see ALL of LA from downtown to the ocean. Quite a view!!! If you want to see the Hollywood sign this is the spot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetogoCalabasas
50,Great spot to get a picture of the Hollywood Sign!!,"Great spot to get a picture of the Hollywood Sign, and downtown, Los Angeles!! Limited parking off Mulholland DRIVE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremiahChris
50,A real must to visit.,We had a fab evening here just being under the stars listening to music was a real treat. We saw Diane Krall & LA philharmonic which was great to listen to. Food & drink a little pricey but then so is any top tourist attraction . Parking !! well we tried all around the streets and ended up in the Bowl as for the sake of 20$ and being on top of the attraction was well worth the money. We would never try parking else where as you spend too much time and the parking ticket enforcers are just waiting for you . A real must on your bucket list to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellshock04
40,Great view,The name really says it all. You get a great view of the bowl. Worth it if it isn't concert season or you can't find time to visit the Bowl properly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidsL7053XW

50,"Great views on a scenic, historic Los Angeles thoroughfare","Mulholland Drive is a very long & winding road that is famous for outstanding views and wonderful scenery throughout its many miles of paved glory. Well worth a leisurely drive to see spectacular mansions & estates, as well as beautiful nature & views such as the Hollywood Bowl Overlook. Be sure to bring your camera--even better if it has video capabilities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb
50,50th Anniversary of the Sound of Music Sing-Along,"What fun! Our group of 100 people dressed in full Bavarian costume attended the Sound of Music Sing-Along with 20,000 other crazy people. The Hollywood Bowl is a legendary place with a view of the Hollywood hills and famous sign. It is outdoors, so take a light jacket. You can bring a full picnic meal with your choice of drinks or food is available. Be patient. There will be many people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOCDQ
50,An Outstanding Concert Venue,"Through the years, the Hollywood Bowl continues to impress as a wonderful concert venue. The view of the stage is excellent no matter where you are sitting, although seating in the rear sections are tight. The sound is very impressive, and is more natural-sounding than many enclosed venues. The food offering is only average tasting. Parking is stacked-parking, so taking the local shuttles is easy and recommended. Overall, the Hollywood Bowl is Highly Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mvillag
50,Great outdoor concert venue,"It's outdoors, so.... check the weather. Bring a jacket because it gets chilly at night.Getting to your seats from parking is a LONG walk uphill, so wear comfortable shoes.I recommend getting seats in the front boxes. It is a little more expensive, but the have tables and waiters to serve food, beer and wine.You can pack a picnic (just no glass) and sit in the back because there are benches and the music is loud enough that you can hear each other talk. Just bring a blanket to sit on.I was very impressed with the food available (sushi, kabobs, burgers).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleV174
50,Public Trx is a must to the Hollywood Bowl,We purchase a series of 5 tickets and get a choice of a free concert. Buy your tickets early. This week we saw Joshua Bell & Reggae Night. The best way to get to the performance is to use Public Trx. check out the web site. www.HollywoodBowl.com/concert. You can get the times on the web site. Also it is best to buy your ticket for the park and ride before hand online or at the bowl box office(7) Vs 12 at the park and ride. The other option is the shuttle which you do not have to purchase ahead of time.You can bring a picnic of food and beverages including alcohol. You can buy food but it is expensive. We had a turkey rap for 12.00 and a arugula/peach salad for 12.00. They were both fresh and tasty. It wasn't crowded at the market. We brought water and had some free lemonade.It was hot on Sunday we wore shorts. It can be very hot before the show so we had hats and sunglasses. It did cool off so I had a light windbreaker that I wore at the end of the concert.The crowd was very friendly. We spoke to our neighbors. At the end of the concert people got in the walkways and were right behind us singing and dancing.There are several restrooms. Which were clean. there are long lines but they do move quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orange552015

50,Wonderful outdoor experience,"This is a wonderful outdoor venue for concerts and music festivals. A friend and I went to hear the LA Philharmonic orchestra and the sound system is fabulous. You can hear and see from anyplace in the bowl. You can pack food and eat prior to the concert. There are picnic areas but you can also just eat in your seat area. You can also purchase food there but it can be a bit expensive and, in my opinion, the quality is not worth the money. We took a park and ride shuttle that took the stress out of driving and parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol

50,Must do in LA,"We bought tickets for a Dudamel's Midsummer night concert. It was great; the first part was traditional classic music, and the next half had some humor and laughs included; Gael Garcia made an appereance due to his role in a tv series about a musician, acting dumb and trying to do as Dudamel does. Later, the opera singers brought to life some italian and german classics, acting out with humor some of them which made what is considered for many something ""boring and dull"" quite cheeeful! The pianist played with such joy it is uncomparable! BTW, before the concert you can have a picnic in the gardens, so pack your apples, cheese and wine and have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933karlisg

Fast forward 20 years and I'm back again at the Playboy Jazz festival 2015 for my husbands 40th birthday. 50 of our family and friends gathered for this wonderful day. We had a great view of the Hollywood sign as we partied to jazz and soul music all day long. The food there is great but expensive so we packed a cooler of our own food and drinks.

We went to the Playboy Jazz Festival (our 3rd time) and cant wait for next year!!The Jazz Festival is unique in that you can bring in any food or drinks you want. Most people willingly share with their neighbors so fast friends are made!The music for the J.F. goes on for 7-8 hours so it is a full day.

40,Great view of the Hollywood sign; not many parking spots,"This is a famous overlook that has a pretty good view of the Hollywood sign. We were really happy to see it, but the parking lot could get quite busy as it had less than 10 spots. The slightly longer spots were usually taken up by tour buses and created havoc on people trying to enter and exit.Views were really spectacular, and it was free. Quite close to town as well.

50,Nice spot to view the Hollywood sign,This is a great overlook to see LA and the Hollywood sign. There are several overlooks along Mulholland and this is the furthest east. It was great for a quick look and some pictures. The drawback is that there are fewer than 10 parking spaces so we picked a time and day when we thought it wouldn't be busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laura_sunshine
50,Must-See Views,"We were at the scenic overlook this morning. The views are amazing and anybody visiting the Hollywood area should stop by to take pictures. You will not be disappointed that you took the 15-30 minutes to do so. The only negative was that it was a little cloudy so the visibility was not great. However, we were still able to get good photos of the city. (Not the Hollywood sign. We could see it but were not able to get great photos of it)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateM_13

This was my first visit to the Hollywood Bowl and i'm already looking forward to returning. There's not too many venues that will allow you to bring your own food and alcohol, but this is not the case at the Hollywood Bowl. My only recommendation is to wear good walking shoes as it's a hike up the hillside if you don't want to wait in line for the escalator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulahonee

50,An experience you can't miss in LA,"I had the opportunity to watch a musical called The Producers and it was undoubtedly one of my best nights in LA. We had booked the cheapest tickets ( 15 USD) but since the seats in front of us were vacant, we upgraded ourselves. Its open air, so it gets really chilly at night. So take plenty of warm clothes. If you get lucky like us and can get a seat upgrade, you will be saved from the biting cold to an extent; it is slightly warm in the front.Almost everybody gets their dinner to the Bowl, its like a familiy picnic. Some carry their table linens and dinner mats, wine/champagne and food. Its an awesome sight to see families sitting and laughing together, sharing a meal. We carried a bottle of wine too to keep ourselves warm and finished the entire thing before leaving, it was that freezing!Variety of food available. Ample options for drinks too.Parking was convenient, but it takes time. Best option is to take a cab.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KBora

Drive up and they'll let you go in and walk around if there is no show going on. A great LA landmark where you can appreciate what Hollywood really is. Meanwhile the overlook above does have a nice view of downtown... drive two miles further West for an almost as good one overlooking Universal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JONH155

40,Very Nice way to enjoy a concert,We are from Chicago and loved the open air venue for a concert with the mountains and the famous Hollywood sign as a back drop. Quite a wide price range for tickets. We bought the 17.50 tickets and were very satisfied. There are screens for close-up viewing. The bench seats have backs and you can bring a blanket or seat cushions. Buy a to go meal at any of the fabulous LA restaurants and enjoy your meal before hand or during the show. Be prepared for some uphill walking and give yourself plenty of time for parking. Very limited venue parking but nearby offerings for $10. If you enjoy the entertainment you won't be disappointed .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TBKathy
40,Dance the night away,"I've seen good shows and one bad but they've all been fun at this venue, under the stars where you can bring in your own eats or eat there. And if your lucky enough to see Buena Vista Social Club night you might even dance in the aisles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesycamore
50,Terrific Theater for listening your favorite singer,This open air theater is one of the best places to enjoy a good concert. With my wife and my daughter had the opportunity to attend a concert with the best selection of the Ray Charles music with songs performed masterfully by four guest artists.One of the key factors in this kind of scenario is the acoustic. Here was perfect.The view and the sound were excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epin
50,Memorable and Economical,"Three of us went on the 4th of July for the Barry Manilow concert. The concert was excellent, even though he seemed to stretch for high notes at times. I could have sworn he was lip syncing a few numbers. Anyway, I digress. This review is for the Bowl itself.I’ve gone there a number of times over the years, and particularly enjoy bringing picnic/wine supplies for enjoyment prior to the concert. Here’s the rub: when they first open the entrance gates, people gallop to the limited picnic table areas. We were near the front of the line when the gates opened; however, by the time we got to one of the upper level quiet picnic table areas, I was doing a 100 yard dash with another party and I got the very last table. The tables are all gobbled up very quickly, and then there are hordes of people milling about looking for non-existent tables. They end up, as I have many times, taking their supplies to their Bowl seats and trying to enjoy a pre-concert picnic in those restricted spaces. So if you want a picnic table, be prepared to get there early and to hustle up the inclines. Hint: if there are tables only half full, don’t be shy – ask if you can join them. People did that at our half empty table and we had no problem with it.That leads me to the parking situation – the Park and Ride busses from around L.A. are a terrific deal (just locate the one closest to where you live). These busses avoid the entire stacked parking scenario; however, if you want to get one of those picnic tables as we did, I found that none of the busses arrive early enough. So we paid the expensive stacked parking at the Bowl. It would have been cheaper for the 3 of us to take the bus vs the flat rate parking charge at the Bowl. But that was my choice and I knew what I was getting into. By the time we got back to the parking lot after the concert, the lot had emptied out enough for us to move right on out.Another word to the wise for anybody in your party with physical disabilities: it’s a fairly grueling steep uphill climb from the parking areas to the entrance gates. And then it’s uphill (literally) from there, although there are some escalators which help.If you can go to the Bowl for one of the fireworks concerts, even better. The fireworks show on the 4th seemed to go on forever and was better than the many fireworks displays I had seen at the Bowl over the years. We REALLY enjoyed the beautiful displays, and they were as good as or better than what some of the large cities offer on the 4th!Do bring a sweater or light jacket because it can get cool at the outdoor Bowl venue. A portable seat cushion helps with those hard bleacher seats (they do rent cushions there, but I bring my own more comfortable cushion). And people in our row were envious that we had brought a large thermos of coffee to drink as the evening wore on. Also, don’t worry about getting the higher priced seats – the large projection screens really help. We had very good seats, but making out Barry’s face was impossible, so we found ourselves eyeing the screens much of the time.I highly recommend a Bowl concert and picnic during the summer, and especially when entertaining folks from out of town. It’s both memorable and economical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034

10,Worst organized place on the West coast.,"I can't deny that the atmosphere at the Hollywood Bowl is wonderful. But the hell that you have to go through before and after every event makes this the most unbearable place that I have gone to in my 15 years of living in Los Angeles. I purchased tickets to see Frozen Planet through Living Social. I printed my certificate, but it said I had to go to Will Call to pick up my tickets. Didn't think that would be such a bid deal. I then looked into the best way to get there. Decided I would do the Park and Ride, so I didn't have to deal with traffic. Clicked on their web link multiple times over a week to get tickets for Park and Ride; it never worked. In the end, we decided to drive there. The website says you can park in Lot A, B or C. Fine. Then that's what we'll do. So we drive to the Bowl, and this takes us over an hour from Playa del Rey. OK, this is LA, so we accept that. By the time we get to lots A, B and C, the small sign says ""Pass Holders Only"". At this point, we passed the other parking lots, and there is no way back. Why could they not state that when we were going by the public parking lots outside the Bowl. So it took us another 30 minutes to be able to come back to the exact same area, and go to the public parking area. Thirty minutes! Then we finally park, and walk about 10 min to the Bowl. The Will Call line was at least 1/4 mile long!. We were in line for about 45 minutes! I complained to the not-so-nice guys at the counter about the ridiculous line, and how the Bowl should be better organized, and why could I not have printed my tickets before. He told me this was because I got the tickets on Living Social!We brought our kids and a picnic dinner to enjoy before the show, thinking we would have about an hour to an hour and a half to do this. We got to our seats at 7:58 PM for the 8:00 show! We left Playa del Rey at 5:30 PM. So it took us 2 1/2 hours to drive, park, get the tickets, then get to our seats. Leaving us a whopping 3 minutes to get our picnic food in. And after the show, we had to deal with the rush of people all going back to their cars at the same time, and having to wait for every car in front of you to get out before we could leave, since they have stacked car parking there.Yes, the show was wonderful. But the irritation and stress of getting there, and getting out of there, made this a really crappy evening. I am never going back there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marc000007
40,Concert,Went to the hollywood bowl for fourth of july. Overall a great experience. However there are a few things I would like to point out. First of all the crowd. Be prepared to stand in line to get into the bowl. Also getting out is quite a choreSecond is the seating. try if you can to get isle seats because since everyone takes so many thingsI it's hard to move in and out of your seat. Other than that the bowl is a great experience something you should not miss in los angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/budman62

50,An Enchanting Evening,"Do not miss an evening at the Hollywood Bowl. Even if you are not a fan of classical music, go. Even if you don't recognize the headline performer, go. Even if you're tired or feeling stingy after a long week of overpriced tourist attractions, go. Together with the Getty Museum, this is the best thing I have done in my limited time as a Southern girl transplanted to Southern California. Here are some tips.First, don't drive your car. They do something called stacked parking, which makes no sense to me since I am from Houston where parking is a God-given right. If you go to the Hollywood Bowl website and follow the link that tells you about finding the venue, you'll find many park-n-ride stops across the city. Locate the one closest to you and pay the money to ride the bus. You'll pay $5 or $10 per person, round trip, for a direct ride on the bus. They drop you off at the entrance and give you easy instructions to find your bus for the ride home. If you book in advance, you will have priority access, but you can pay at the pick-up spot if you don't mind waiting until the last bus leaves. We did this and still made the show with plenty of time to grab a boxed dinner and find our seat.Second, you can take a picnic dinner and your beverage of choice into the park. If you are like us and decide to take in a concert at the eleventh hour, be sure to take your own bottle of wine and some bottled water. Food at the Bowl is on the expensive side, but if you are a tourist and can't make your own picnic dinner, it isn't outrageous.Third, wear comfortable shoes and be sure to take a sweater or light jacket. Once the sun goes down, it gets chilly in Hollywood even in the summer.Finally, you don't need to buy the most expensive seat in the house to enjoy the show. There are large projection screens on which the entire production is broadcast, and all are easily seen even from the least expensive seats. We got seats in the M section, which is directly in front of the stage, and were very happy.All in all, a concert at the Hollywood Bowl--any concert--is one of the best things about an LA vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scout1960
50,Beautiful,"A beautiful venue indeed. Went there for coldplay concert, I was a little bit worried about the seats we got. We have section M seats, on the lay out I found on the internet the seats seem like they're quite far from the stage. In reality, there are no bad seats in this venue. I like the open-ess of the venue, I love how the venue is beautifully maintained and many selections of food and drinks(alcoholic) in there. The parking areas were awful though, 23 dollars for stack parking...if the people who own the car in front of you hasn't come back to their car, there is no way to leave the parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karshka
50,Coldplay at the Bowl!,"The line moved quickly, staff were friendly and they even allow you to bring in your own food and drink! The only drag was waiting for one inconsiderate slowpoke to move her car at the end of the night, as she was blocking the entire parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelDavidWalker

50,Great view! Worth doing!,"I visited the Hollywood Bowl Overlook on my last day in LA. I had my rental car for several more hours, and wanted to see the Hollywood Bowl. The concierge at my hotel told me that I could take the windy road up into Hollywood Hills, and there was an Overlook pull-off with a great view on Muholland Drive. On my GPS I typed in Muholland Drive and was given a choice of Muholland Drive or Multiview Drive. I figured that Multiview Drive made the most sense, so that's what I picked. Fortunately I was right. Anyway there are two or three pull-offs along this road with views. I was traveling from North Hollywood towards Hollywood. I'm not sure where or what was at the first pull-off (as indicated by the GPS), but at the second pull-off there was a wonderful view of Universal City. Several more miles down the road was the pull-off for the Hollywood Bowl Overlook. The views were incredible. You can climb the steps to the top and there is a wonderful view of the HOLLYWOOD sign. The Hollywood Bowl is right below, and the Los Angeles skyline and views of the freeway are straight ahead. The only downside for me was that it was a very rainy day, but even with the rain I got a bird's eye view of Universal City, the Hollywood Bowl, the HOLLYWOOD sign, and a heavily overcasted LA. I can only imagine that on a clear day the view would be phenomenal. If you have a car, going to the Hollywood Bowl Overlook is definitely worth doing. If you don't have a car, some of the tour companies will take you here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30

50,Magical - a feast for the senses,"Make sure to take a picnic & a chilled bottle of your favorite tipple. Leave enough time to get to the venue. We arrived 2 hours before the concert start time. Be sure to leave your video camera at home or be prepared to check it in, they are not allowed in. Make sure to hire a seat cushion if you are sitting on the benches and enjoy. We had a magical evening under the stars listening to the talented LA Phil last Friday. The conductor talked about each piece and made it really come to life which was very interesting and the icing on the cake were the fireworks. If you have the opportunity to do so, this really is one not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Layonacouch
40,Great Open Air Concect - Hollywood Bowl,"What a great experiece seeing a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer under the stars! Go, go, go! If you are in the Hollywood area and don't have plans go to the Bowl and it doesn't even matter who's playing or what you see. There are plenty of tickets available from the tons of scalpers or perhaps even at the box office. So even if you have not plan on seeing a certain concert with advanced tickets, just go anyway! Best thing, you can take your own food and Adult beverages too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triplea01
