50,target shooting,"excellent facility. friendly staff. very safe. for those of you who don't like the stern demeanor of staff, remember your setting. lots of people learning about firearms. you can be seriously injured by a careless shooter. this is why the range officers are so terse. they make sure your safety comes first. if you have hurt feelings over the range officers correcting you in a stern manner, get over it. your life is in their hands. you should thank them at the end of your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdbd
10,"Awful staff, so rude","The staff, especially one range officer, were rude, arrogant, terse or uninterested. The only nice people I encountered there was the guy that sold items at the front door, he was awesome and friendly.....and someone using the range that was kind enough to give me some ear protection as I was watching the shooters.The range officer (possibly called Don, based on the name on his earmuffs) was super rude. Rightly so, he got angry at one person that did something unsafe, but his manner towards them was still condescending, full on and could have been slightly less severe especially as he was belittling the shooter in front of everyone. Even a few of the other shooters approached me and told me not to worry about ""Don"" as he was a bit uptight.It wouldn't kill him to learn a small degree of manners when talking to people, especially visitors from another country. I most certainly didn't appreciate being barked at like a second class citizen for having a camera. As an Australian that doesn't see cool guns like you Americans have I was keen to see what was available and to take a few photos of the actual guns (not the people shooting them). His delivery when he told me off was uncalled for in that manner. He then ""instructed me"" to check in at the main office (that I had already done upon arrival and was told it was okay to go down and watch). I had told the main office I just wanted to look and take a few photos and it seemed fine with them. Additionally, there are NO signs saying that photos are not allowed.Long story short - Don is terribleI'd never go back, I was made to feel very unwelcome. Thanks ""Don"" for being the rudest American I have met thus far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeejayAPC
50,Excellent Range,"A couple of my co-workers and I took a ""mental health day"" (e.g. a day-off) mid-week and spent the day here. We had called earlier in the month and reserved 100 yard range as we were bringing a full assortment of handguns, rifles, and shotguns.This is a large well-run range with plenty of area in which to sight a scope or just practice and hone your skills. The range masters are serious and very safety-conscious, which I appreciate. Call ahead if you need to reserve one of the longer-ranged areas. Make sure to visit their website and review their FAQs and rules. This is a serious sport.Some logistical items:From where I live in Orange county, it takes approximately 90 minutes to get to the shooting range. From the 210 Freeway, take Azusa Ave north. Azusa Ave will change to San Gabriel Canyon Road. Stay on this road for approximately 11 miles (from freeway offramp to the Range). The road is a beautiful drive into the canyon. Take your time and take in the views as you go. Turn right on East Fork Road, cross the bridge, and take it to the Range entrance. There will be small signs as you approach.The driveway will take several switchbacks climbing steeply into the canyon. Follow the signs to the range office and check in there.NOTE: They do not allow steel-core ammunition and will check your ammo to be sure.While they have a small selection of sodas and snack foods, I would recommend that you bring an ice chest with lunch and your own water and drinks. Azusa is about 11 miles to your south and there aren't any services nearer. They also sell ammo, in case you forgot yours or run out but it will be priced a bit higher.Restrooms are onsite but are the ""porta-potty"" variety. Finally, cell-service doesn't work out there as you'll be too deep into the canyon.Plan on several hours here. The area is beautiful and you can spend a full day out on the range.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6633PYpauls
