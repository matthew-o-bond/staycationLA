10,Review is for Eagle Rider USA,"They'll screw you eventually. I was one of the original ""charter"" members and have been with them for several years. Have a medical condition that leaves me unable to ride and I was hoping to be able to pause my membership while a recover. Started with phone support and eventually was given the name of DANIEL DIAZ | EAGLERIDER, National Franchise & Business Integration Manager. I emailed him in November 2019 and he responded on November 15th to inform me he would pass along my request to someone to help. It's December 22nd and I haven't heard anything, even after requesting he check on the status of my request. Bottom line: they are difficult to contact (almost as if it is on purpose) and they are unresponsive. I just lost almost 2 years of eagle rider days: about $750. Buyer beware.",stevefulaytar
50,Fantastic Service,"Absolutely amazing experience from day one, searching for a motorcycle to hire the website was quick, easy and clear, nothing hidden and all up front! When arriving at the store, the staff were very helpful and friendly and couldn't have picked a better company to hire a motorbike, if I find myself in Los Angeles again I will be sure to pay them another visit!",Rob I
50,Top notch service and crew!,"I have rented from this location on several occasions this year, and the service has always been top notch. This time, we worked with Victor who was just amazing in every way. We had some tight timelines (due to the situation, traffic, and a large group checking in while we were checking in). Victor assured us that we would get out quickly and calmly made that happen - from the check-in process through the bike check out and drive off. Great job, Victor!!!",Wally H

50,Wild West tour - 14 days May 2018,"It was our third time when we had a guided motorcycle tour organized by Eagle Rider. We decided to use Eagle Rider because this company provides services on the highest level. Satisfaction guaranteedüòÄThis time, after Road 66 and Canada-Yellowstone tour, we did 14 days Wild West led by Stefano Trampetti. Our tour started in Los Angeles, where we took the motorcycles, and from there we rode through the beautiful parks of the South West, through Yosemite Park, San Francisco, back to LA through the famous road ‚ÄûNumber 1‚Äù. Stefano is a fantastic and professional leader who perfectly managed a great group of international riders, took care of the safety of a group and he also provided great routes. Without him our tour would not be so successful. We highly recommend both the Eagle Rider tour and the leader. You will get unforgettable impressions and memories and friendship for life !!!! ‚úåÔ∏èRobert and Jola - Poland",Robert Arizona
