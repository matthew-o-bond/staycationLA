40,Great Yogurt,"This is a really nice yogurt shop, popular with high school crowd and families alike. the staff is very good and the yogurt and fresh toppings are too die for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cimcat
30,Just not a fan,I'm not a fan of the tart original...I'm more into gourmet ice cream...gelato is my favorite...but as far as nonfat frozen yogurt goes...this has an interesting taste..but not enticing enough to keep me coming back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gamyleigh
20,They're getting greedy.,"I've been coming here since the store opened and I've noticed that they are starting to be real stingy with toppings. These Yogurts cost around 5 bucks for a medium. It's good , but the folks at Pinkberry better be careful or they will lose customers. RedBerry in Newbury park tastes very similar and is alot cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JT1967
10,Stinky Establishment,"This place smells horrible! I am not sure where the stinch comes from, but it is the worst smelling Pinkberry I've ever been too. I've been to a couple in LA and neither of those smelled like this one. My guess is the material used in the flooring of this place, which makes it very difficult to clean. If they don't do something soon, they may not pass the next health inspection. The stinch made me and my friends extremely nauseous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonvu
40,Yum! Green Tea Yogurt...,"You'll find this outpost of the LA - area chain in a shooping center (3835 E Thousand Oaks Blvd , Westlake Village, CA 91362)down a bit from the Trader Joe's.I went there one evening soon after it opened, to find people hanging around, chatting and eating their yogurts. These frozen concoctions come in two flavors - plain and green tea, with fruit toppings extra. Shave ice with yogurt and fruit smoothies are also available.I had the green tea yogurt topped with kiwi pieces, which was not too sweet and did taste of tea. Although overpriced (nearly $5 for a 5 oz. cup) I thought it pretty good...:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betnich
