30,Carnival Splendor Cruise Mexican Riviera Cruise 7 Days,"Just returned from a 7 day Mexican Riviera Cruise on the Carnival Splendor (Feb 2 to the 9th 2019). We stayed in stateroom 6337. The cruise was OK, but the ship is dated (going for a reno in Oct 2019).Transportation - There was 3 of us and paid for the Carnival transportation at a cost of $30 each x 3 = $90. My sister and her family of 3 took an Uber and paid $45 including one stop. Standard flat rate for a cab is $60.00 We took the cab back and there is plenty of cabs waiting as you get off the ship.The food was below average for a cruise ship especially on the Lido deck, very plain. Also in the AM we used to enjoy getting breakfast in bed, now you can only get a continental breakfast, but it was still ok.The entertainment was lacking, usually ships have many singers in various bars in the evening where you can go listen, but the Splendor seemed to lack this. They had some in the casino but it was so filled with smoke we could not sit in there. We went to the comedy club a couple of times and it was hit and miss.The only place I could find ok music in a lounge was in the karaoke bar listening to other passengers of which most were decent.The ships crew had a big sales job on, every time I did anything there was a push to buy something, reminded me of the beach people in Mexico trying to sell their wares. I got a haircut, and spa treatment and after each was a big sales job. Even went to a couple of on ship talks and after 1.5 hours each they came to the end just trying to sell you their products.They must all get big commissions but really took away from our experience.The room was small, felt smaller than most ships we have been on. (Cruised about 10 times on many cruise lines)Also did not like the idea of the increase they did with tips including for our 8 year old, the total was $300 for the 3 of us all sharing one room.They also now charge fees for room service, they have a few items that do not come with a fee but most do. Seems like they increased their fees for everything and reduced their services. We will look for a different cruise line for our remaining cruises.The airline (Air Canada) lost my wife's luggage and did not get it to the ship until 2 days from the end. We asked for a discount washing her cloths but the ship refused.(she did pack an extra outfit in her carry on, but that is all she had)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632CurtisS
30,Foot message,"Well for $20.00 the foot message felt good,didn't appreciate the whisper conversation amongst the massage therapist,as I went to completely relax.Again,the message felt great,but when I left $4.00 for the tip,I was told that wasn't enough and that I had to give her a minimum of $5.00.Kinda uncomfortable as even their receipt provided tip amounts ranching from 10% to 20% in which it even gave the amount of $4.00 for a 20% tip.When it comes to a tip,I will always give a minimum of 20% but will not be told how much I need to give.It just so happen to be all I had in my wallet,so I had to charge on my card and they do charge you a fee for that.Wont be going back,as their is a good one closer to my house that I will try next time-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GinGal13
50,affordable and well spent money,"we had full body massage head, back, arms, legs, body and feet for just $30 with a private room. really good deal, there's a lot competitors beside them but their business is affordable and very good massage. definetly will come back GodBless J+C",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoemartColeen
