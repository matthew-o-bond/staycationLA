50,Always a treat,"Just got back from the Skirball. Lunch, and the Kubrick exhibit. The restaurant just reopened a couple of weeks ago, and they don't quite have their act together. But the exhibit was nicely curated (as always), and an interesting preview to his movies. Closes in March, go if you can.",Marty P
40,Interesting special exhibits. Recommended.,Currently the American Dream and the Stanley Kubrick exhibits are well worth a stopover in addition to the permanent exhibit. Beautiful venue.,Waterloonie
50,Pretty cool experience for all,My family and I were visiting my brother and his family during the holiday season. He mentioned that we should go to Noah's Ark. He couldn't really describe it but once we got there it was pretty cool. I love how it tells the story of Noah's Ark and the animals and ark are created out of recyclable items. The added touches of storytime and sing-a-long time was a hit for the kids as well. If you are in the area you should stop by and have a look!,Traveling_Teacher238
50,Sensational Skirball,"This is a great place to see exhibits. We saw two photo exhibits one by Stanely Kubric and the other about the American Dream. Both really well done. Parking is free and the entrance fee is $12. It is a great space and very easy to get to from the 405 freeway, They also have a Noah's Ark exhibit that is supposed to be a very fun adventure for children, I really enjoyed this museum and highly recommend for a visit. I know I will definitely go back.",B. Darst
40,Great for Kids,Well done kids museum. Best for kids up to 7 years. Try to get the free admission days (check with Skirball first.),Sharon A

40,Beatuiful Venue!,"Came here to participate in an event and the venue is really beautiful! It was my first time hearing of this place , but it absolutely did not disappoint!The only negatives thing I have to say about this place, is that there is a bunch of mosquito / flies , but I believe that is because of the pond they have outside!But hey, nothing's perfect + for the view depending on your event , it really is a beautiful venue!Only reason I'm giving it a 4/5 is because I was outside majority of the day and got swarmed by flies / mosquitoes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",Eric Phuong
50,"Always love going here for the exhibits, live music, screenings and beautiful grounds","I cannot say enough good things about the Skirball!! You don't need to be Jewish to enjoy the great exhibits, live music of all types, special screenings and of course the beautiful grounds. I became a member to support such a wonderful organization and I was especially glad I did when I showed up on the very last day of a popular exhibit and was able to skip the very long line. You also get first dibs on their amazing programs in the theater, some of which are free to members.And you don't need to be a kid or have kids to enjoy a walk through Noah's Ark or enjoy the family music series presented on summer weekend days. Be sure to go and don't forget to stop Audrey's Museum Store which has the coolest stuff and great jewelry.",Dijou
40,Skirball Cultural Center,Wonderful museum with varying events and exhibits. Good concerts here during the summers outside on the back patio area. Nice place to spend a summer night.,raj b
50,Fabulous displays,"My husband and I went to the Skirball on a Saturday around noon. We enjoyed the special displays and had a great time walking through the Center. It was not busy, and had a great diversity of people - from babies to seniors.We also ate at the restaurant and I had the best tuna salad I have had in a long time! We also had gluten-free cookies and an apple to round out our meal. The cookies were also the best gluten-free cookies I have ever had - but who can not like chocolate chip?",Pamela C
50,You'll enjoy it.,"Very informative about the Jewish experience.. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. Great place for a family outing. There is an art studio for projects for kids. It's well worth the twelve dollar admission. On Thursdays it's free. Or free with a Bank of America card on the weekend. Parking is about $15.00 During the summer there's music or dance or storytelling events. There's a small indoor snack area where you can buy sandwiches, salads and snacks or you can bring your own food and enjoy eating on the patio. There are several with lots of shade for a hot day. It's really nice. I highly recommend it.",Dioalan

50,A Culture Center for all people - old and young (and kids),"We were a group of five adults (one couple non-Jewish) and 4 kids (who had a great time at the Noah's Ark section). Frankly, we did not expect that much pleasure and interest the way we experienced at the visit. The exhibition regarding 4000 years of Jewish History was, of course, of our main interest. Here, in a nutshell, is exposed the history of a people and countries, which otherwise could take days to study and comprehend.The special exhibits of Fashion (Rudi Gernreich) and ""black is Beautiful"" were, alone, worth the trip.We had a picnic on the lovely grounds.Plenty of free parking.A tip: on the way back to town don't take the 405. Use the MulHolland road instead.This road meanders among hills and gorgeous homes with a wonderful view of L.A. at your feet...It takes longer to get down to town, but one wishes that the road would never end...",marni390
40,An Great Facility Just up the Street from the Getty,"A beautiful facility, the Skirball Center is another great LA museum and event center, much smaller than the Getty Center, but still very impressive, and right up the street from the Getty (in fact, it's super easy to catch the bus from one to the next. Just use the GO METRO app for bus times). But whereas the Getty is always great, the Skirball is really all about catching an exhibit you like, as they are always changing. Sometimes the exhibits are great, like the recent Ruth Bader Ginsberg exhibit that my wife and I loved. At the same time, I'm not a fan of the Noah's Arc exhibit. Seems kind of silly to me, unless you're an old testament fan, and have kids who like that sort of thing, too. But some of their kid friendly exhibits, like the recent Muppets show, are great for adults, too!So check out their schedule online and plan accordingly, as the Skirball has lots of free concerts, lectures, and other rotating exhibitions that are just great.Also, if you are a Bank of America customer, the Skirball is FREE OF CHARGE one weekend a month. Check B of A's website for which are the free weekends. Saves you a lot of money, especially if going with a group.",John P
50,Rudi Gernreich exhibit was great!,"We went to the Skirball Center for the Rudi Gernreich exhibit, which was excellent. It's a lovely space, and we appreciated the free parking. It's also very close to the Getty Center, so it's easy to combine both activities in one day. If there's an exhibit happening here that interests you I definitely recommend going!",CalgaryAlphan

50,Such an unexpected pleasure!,"We've been wanting to go here for years and finally made the trip up the 405. Free parking! Free entrance with monthly Bank of America promotion. Special exhibits on fashion, photography and art. Noah's ark and the Jewish history in America topped it off. Will be back again with the youngsters in the family.",marc c
50,Prom Day,My granddaughter had a Fabulous time for her Prom ..she said it was very nice . The food was good a..especially the deserts. You know Prom is always suppose to be fun dressing up and looking gorgeous and hanging out in places you normally would not have visited . She was glad to see the Jack Skirball center and will visit again.,Antoinette Williams
50,WONDERFUL,We could only spend about an hour there - but the Jewish History exhibition was well worth it. It is easy to comprehend and full of new and interesting information.,barbarasiegal
50,"Beautiful, Convenient Venue","We held an event here for students and families, in the auditorium. Beautiful venue conveniently located off of Interstate 405. The price for rental was reasonable because we were there on a day when they were usually closed. They have onsite catering, which was a bit limited on this day because as I said it was a day that they are usually closed. Beautiful wooded grounds, large glass windows make the outside easy to view.",MrsOregon2009

50,Last day of a great exhibit,"I was fortunate to be invited to the last day of the Ruth Bader Ginsburg exhibit at the Skirball. The exhibit featured her life and career all the way up to and including her service on the US Supreme Court. I thought it was a tremendous tribute to a great woman, regardless of party affiliation. Although I didn't have enough time to see other parts of the Center this time, I have been to the Skirball several times in the past and they always have something new and interesting.",Robert L
50,A wonderful trip,"We went to the Skirball not knowing what to expect. We had a wonderful time, moving from History to Society to Pop Music and Art all in a few hours.

50,Fabulous,We want mainly for the Ruth Bader Ginsburg exhibit which was extremely worthwhile. I read everything sign on every wall. The rest of the museum was fascinating. I learned a lot. We ended the vast by spending money in the great gift shop.,purrcy2016

50,Noah's Ark for your Kids of all ages,"The Skirball is the gift that keeps on giving. Adults love it and enjoy the museum and live entertainment; but what about kids?They will fall in love with Noah;s Ark and the Archeology Dig. We take our great grandchildren and they never want to leave. They can make thunder, create rain, climb ropes ladders and play with the hand puppets for hours and hours. So will you!",Chaplain DOV Cohen
50,Wonderful place to visit,"I go to exhibits and use to go for Dr Mark Milstein's lectures. Very beautiful place and very helpful staff. Although closed for remodeling at this time, the restaurant is nice. Good and service good, and nice not to have to look for a place to have lunch. There is also a stand outside the restaurant that sells salads and sandwiches, that is open at this time",jojtrust
50,great little venue off of the 405 with unique exhibits,this is a really unique venue just off of the 405. the venue is absolutely beautiful and so are the surrounding gardens and grounds. they host some very unique exhibits. we saw Paul Simon's collection complete with a small private concert.

Main exhibit is a good refresher on everything you should know about the Jewish People.",JeffreyGL48
50,"Small, well done, family friendly, multi-ethnic and and all around good vibe","Loved Noah's Ark- but even more, loved the kids reaction to it. Really great artistry and humor and still, sensitive to each animal's evocation. Saw some of Judge Ginsburg exhibit and learned even more ( and that's after two movies about her).

50,Great visit,"Kids were out of school and we decided to visit the Skirball Cultural center. The main draw was to see the RBG exhibit but there is so much to see. History of the Jewish community in America, Noah's ark, an art room for kids. The bummer is the museum is only open from noon-5pm. We came early and the exhibit area was crowded with someone giving a lecture/tour and everyone else who wanted to see it or go thru. Will need to make a couple more visits to see everything.",twinmom8
50,Free on Thursdays,"The Skirball opens at noon and is very crowded o Thursdays. If you want to see the Noah's Ark exhibit get there early as tickets ""sell"" out with in an hour.

40,Ruth Bader Ginsburg exhibit with once yearly free admission from L.A. Public Library,"A few months ago, I saw the documentary ""RBG"" about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a movie theater. It was the inspirational story about Ginsburg's legal career fighting for equality. I watched it again on DVD checked out from the library and found out that the L.A. Public Library has a program that allows library patrons to get free passes to area museums once per calendar year. I had been interested in going to an exhibit on Ginsburg at the Skirball Center and fortuitously, it is one of the museums on the passes list so I got the pass and went to the exhibit today. It is well worth the trip up the 405 to see the exhibit, particularly since Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion on the Supreme Court decision not to renew the Voting Rights Act that protected mostly African-American voters from individual states' attempts to bar them from voting.Another is kind of fun: visitors can put on one of a number of both adult- and child-sized judges' black robes as well as replicas of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's jabot collars that she wears with the robes to take photos behind a replica of the SCOTUS table; I noticed a great many women and girls doing this, and I hope that they are inspired to become lawyers to fight inequality and injustice like Ginsburg was. Ginsburg wears different jabots that signal whether she writes the majority opinion or the dissenting one. The RBG exhibit at Skirball is wonderful and runs through March 10, 2019 when the exhibit will travel across the U.S.",Kaufu

50,Noahs ark,"It rained a lot the first two days that we were in Los Angeles and a lot of things to do are mainly outdoors however we did find some very enjoyable things to do indoors too. We found this beautifully built Noahs Ark @skirball_la. Many of the animals are built using recycled materials like old whisks, keys, pots, gloves, shoes, bags etc and Hazel honestly had a blast! There's books to read, animals to touch and play with, instruments, handles to turn, sensory sounds, climbing ropes, bridges and lots of running space😄. Also every Thursday is free at this centre for everybody",Sheniz M

50,Loved learning about Jewish history and culture,Took my 7th grade son for a homeschool field trip- wonderful exhibits about Jewish culture and history including immigrating to America and the Holocaust. He particularly enjoyed the Noah's ark exhibit as did I even though it's geared for younger children.,Michelle N
50,Well thought out; kudos to the curator,"Although this museum by many standards does not have an extensive collection, what it does have is well displayed and shown in a logical chronological order. It's strength is showing the history of the Jewish people during the diaspora. My wife and i were pleasantly surprised and found our time well spent.",Robert P
50,Their curator deserves awards!,"I had my first visit here this week and was so pleasantly surprised.The building itself is beautiful. Lush greenery and the architecture had slight Getty-vibes. The real jewel though is the exhibits inside. When I visited, they had Noah's Ark and Notorious RBG.For kids, Noah's Ark is one of the best interactive exhibits for children I've ever seen and even as an adult I was delighted. The staff walking around this exhibit were also great, played well with the children and were very high-energy/engaging.For the adults, RBG was a great snapshot of the Justice's life. Most people were actually taking the time to read most of the placards on the walls and within the displays, which I think speaks to how compelling the content was.Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to explore their permanent collection of Judaica but the displays we did see were up to the same standard as their temporary exhibitions.On the logistics side, there's free parking, reasonable admission prices (free on Thursdays) and very helpful staff.",jem2amae1
40,Wonderful Family Fun,"The Skirball has something for everyone. I love the summer Sunset Concerts, and I love the great activities for kids, including interactive and educational exhibits plus artistic workshops. The last time we were there my granddaughter made a beautiful animal mask. There is a museum with ever changing exhibits and a permanent collection. In the evenings there are concerts and plays. I have tickets for the highly acclaimed Notorious RBG, which screens in November. There is also a good restaurant and wonderful snacks. A lot of the events, such as the Sunset Concerts, are free. Finally, there is lots of parking and it is almost always free. So, I highly recommend spending a happy and productive afternoon at the Skirball.",lollydepaulo
40,"Awesome Place, Terrible Location","Before I get the thumbs down for my review, please let me explain. First and foremost, this place is BEAUTIFUL! I'm not by any means giving this place a bad rating at all. Came here for a conference and I was blown away by the campus. HOWEVER, the only bad thing I can say about this place is where it's located. For anyone visiting, please keep in mind that Los Angeles traffic will be your worst enemy when visiting. That is what I am basing this review on. For any locals visiting from the San Gabriel Valley or further south, plan a whole day of driving that treacherous 10 and 405 freeways. Both of which are not very forgiving freeways. That's the ONLY bad thing I have to say about this place. I hate that my review is based solely on the location but it's way past Downtown Los Angeles and traffic at anytime on the freeways that lead to the Center are always jam packed. Again though, the Center itself, BEAUTIFUL. If visiting, just give your self extra drive time and LOTS of patience if you are more than 5 or 10 miles away from the Center itself.",gcfam79
50,A delightful Wed. afternoon,"Our 2nd visit to Skirball since we live on the east coast. The Jim Henson exhibit was well curated, with real muppets and memorabilia and re-creations of the film sets he had created. Hands on exhibits are always a favorite. Although we are senior citizens, we loved sharing the exhibition space with families and children. We brought our own picnic lunch and were so happy to be able to eat outside on their dining patio (tables & chairs). We were alone (no other diners) with the gorgeous setting, trees swaying with a light breeze. We had a few minutes to experience the Bernstein Exhibit as well - full of memorabilia, even his childhood piano! A very in depth look at the genius we remember well.

It sells out. Plan to spend a couple of hours inside the ear, it's well worth it. I even was crawling around with my child it was so much fun. Overall we spent about 4-5 hours there, we even brought our lunch & ate outside. There is plenty to keep your young one entertained",natural1sumr

We were able to see the Noah’s arc exhibit and it was so cool! They made animals out of recycled/repurposed materials and it was all interactive.

50,Jim Henson is a not to miss exhibit !,It ends soon but it was so fantastic and well done . They had it so well organized and the displays were so bright and fun . We learned a lot about Jim and his journey. Try to see the exhibit before it ends next week. The Noah’s Ark exhibit was amazing as well . Make sure you pay close attention to all the animals that are made from recycled garbage .,lb33wonka
50,One of the Best Kept Secrets in LA,"The Skirball is the next exit past the Getty, but very few folks know about it. It has a permanent exhibit Visions and Values which used to be dedicated to the holocaust and is now showing Jewish Culture from start to now. It is uplifting where the old display was sad. They have many visiting exhibits. We saw Jim Henson and the Muppets, and Leonard Bernstein at 100, which were both great. The Noah's Ark exhibit which is permanent is a must for anyone with kids. It is made from repurposed materials and it is amazing. I had not been there for 16 years and the changes they have made are great. We went shortly after 9-11 to see the life size photos of first responders which was moving. It is one of LA's gems!",Jay B
50,GO!,"We went for the Henson exhibit and stayed to experience the permanent exhibit about Jewish history. It was wonderful, so full of information and interesting exhibits. I have a much deeper respect and understanding of Jewish traditions and history.

50,Childhood memories and Noah's Ark,"Currently, the most popular exhibits on display are Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and Noah's Ark. In addition, to these temporary exhibits, there's also an Art Studio, Ampetheater (live music at 12:00 p.m. & 2 p.m.) and an archeological dig.Jim Henson's the creator of Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock displays are beautiful and detailed. There were interactive displays such as the Fraggle Rock band with live music that was perfect for a photo opportunity. There were also televisions playing clips of all three shows (Fraggle Rock, Sesame Street, and The Muppets).Noah's Ark ~ You're allowed 90 minutes once you're given a pass to go inside the exhibit. There's no additional fee for any of the exhibits inside the Cultural Center. The Noah's Ark exhibit has plenty of activities fun for kids, such as a rope course, storytime, and plush stuffed animals. In addition, kids are able to generate sound effects such as rain, thunder, and wind. Overall, the exhibit is beautifully set up with artifacts featuring different versions of Noah's Ark.I would recommend going early because of the crowd of people and on the day that we went, the Noah's Ark exhibit was sold out by 12:30 p.m. There are a cafe and two gift shops available to purchase souvenirs. Parking is free and there's an elevator for wheelchair access. The doors to the building don't have a handicapped automatic button so you will need to lean on the doors for them to open.",Erica Dozier

50,Worth a visit to see permanent exhibition about Judaism in America,"While you are visiting the Westside area (west of 405 freeway), do plan a stop to visit the Skirball Center to see the permanent exhibition about history of Judaism in the world, and in America. Artifacts and displays are well done. There are often rotating/visiting exhibitions there too so you could see several, have a soda/coffee break in the cafe or courtyard which is pleasant and reasonably priced.",highlandbride
50,A wonderful museum with fabulous exhibits,The Jewish history is very interesting and well-presented. I love the Muppets and could have spent days at the exhibit. The Noah's Ark exhibit was incredibly clever and wonderfully interactive. It's appropriate for children of all ages.,Joan Z
50,Jim Henson Exhibit and Jewish History,"Tracing Jim Henson's career and the evolution of Muppets from TV to movies, this exhibit was just a delight to see. Beginning with Rowlf the Dog on the Jimmy Dean show, the breakout with Sesame Street and then the Muppet Show, the displays utilize video clips, photos and the actual puppets. It progresses to show the various Muppet movies and the later spin off TV shows as well. For kids, there's a small theater where you can try your hand at performing with the puppets. The Muppet exhibit is housed in a museum of Jewish culture which displays artifacts from synagogues and traces Jewish history. There's even a small segment on the Holocaust. We happened to visit on a Thursday and were pleasantly surprised to find it was free entry on Thursdays!",Mary Jo N
50,Wonderful exhibits,"I came here for the Jim Henson Exhibit but there was so much more to see. The Jim Henson exhibit is wonderfully displayed, with many interactive options for kids. I love that they have scanned in his notes and sketches in you can use the display notebooks to read through them. Also enjoyed the Leonard Bernstein exhibit, which also has interactive elements among the displays. The Jewish Heritage section was amazing. While it wasn't what we went there to see, we all loved it for the history and information that it had. We learned a lot during our visit.The displays are spread out so you don't feel crowded while trying to read or look at the displayed items. The museum is spacious and there are docents all over. We didn't take a guided tour, but they are offered. There is a quick cart for food or a cafe. We ate at the cafe and it was very good food at reasonable prices.",Laura R
50,Wonderful!,"This was one of the nicest conference centers / museums I've seen! The staff were very friendly, too. And free parking!",luv2travel22018

50,LA Museum Under the Radar,"This is an amazing museum on so many different levels for persons of all ages. For children, there is a wonderful Noah's Ark please touch hands on exhibition. Children were having an amazing experience climbing, playing with puppets, exploring, building. Currently, there is a Leonard Bernstein exhibition that celebrates the 100 birthday of the composer. One gets immersed in the history and music of this American genius. Also, there is currently a Jim Henson exhibition that brings Sesame Street and the Muppets to life. All this, plus the magnificent Judaica, make this a must visit for both locals and visitors to Los Angeles.",springpa
40,A Magical Place to Take Younger Kids,"Searching for fun things to do with kids, we stumbled upon a very special Jim Henson exhibit happening at the Skirball cultural Center. This would be our first visit, and probably our last until we're grandparents one day. My daughter is 13 and just past the age range of being a perfect daddy date.That said, the cost was right around $12 to get in, but on arriving we were given a sticker and not charged for admission, it turns out that admission is FREE on Thursdays. We didn't have enough time to visit the Noah's Ark attraction since available showtimes were 2-3 hours from when we had arrived, but we did see everything else.We did explore the entire center and visit the Jim Henson exhibit where I got to relive childhood experiences with the Muppets, Sesame Street cast, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and other characters I grew up watching on television. My daughter enjoyed it to, but you know teenagers, nothing's interesting except maybe boys or Snapchat.We had lunch at the cafe inside the building. I didn't know it was vegetarian until after we had already sat down, but I managed to survive with a Margherita Pizza. My daughter ordered the Grilled Salmon And Orechiette Pasta. Surprisingly, the food was actually filling and tasty.If I had any complaints at all, it would be how long lines are handled. There should be staff members entertaining those waiting in 30-40 exhibit lines or televisions hanging from the ceiling. But hey, we got in free so who am I to complain anyway?Definitely a fun place to take younger children (2-10), I hope to make it back here with grandchildren one day.",Steve W
50,A great place to visit for a lazy afternoon!,One of the iconic museum's in the Los Angeles area. Magnificent Judaica and well appointed throughout.,ashebroe
50,Amazing visit,"The Skirball Center is absolutely jaw dropping. I did not want to leave. Went to see the Jim Henson Exhibition but after arriving I found there was so much more to discover. The level of Jewish American history just blew me away. Also very much enjoyed the Leonard Bernstein Exhibition but this cultural center is just beautiful, historic, and perfect in every way. If you are at all interested in history, this is definitely a place to visit.",nfarst
40,Cool place to visit @ the Jewish Cultural Museum,"I came here to experience the Jim Hansen Muppet Exhibit and was not disappointed. Its a nice museum and cultural center celebrating Jewish religion and history. I learned a lot as a non-jew as the exhibits were well planned and educational. As a younger person I did not feel bored looking at the exhibits.The Muppet exhibit was great, as was the ark and the entire museum. Parking is easy and free and its in a nice neighborhood.",Ashley S
50,A Fine Place,"Came here for a business conference. The buildings, campus and amenities were very impressive. Each building has unique outside and inside design features. Very comfortable spacing, attractive flora, nice large meeting rooms, good acoustics and better than average food for lunch for several hundred folks. I’ll be back👍",aresverde
30,Lovely Place!,"A lovely place to visit, Jim Henson Exhibition in particular. Most kids would very enjoy puppets of his creations, but we adults would more appreciate Henson’s unique body of work and his popular makings—The Muppet Show, the Muppet movies, and Sesame. We saw his (and his colleagues’) character sketches, storyboards, scripts, photographs, costumes, film and television clips, and behind-the-scenes footages.We were amazed at Bernstein’s “performance” and his achievement which displayed at the Skirball! This year we came to celebrate his “100 year old birthday” and valued his wonderful works like West Side Story and On the Waterfront.We pretty much relished this afternoon visit to Skirball.",Chuang004
50,Best lunch in west LA @ cafe,"Best lunch in west LA with free parking and reasonable prices. Gourmet pizzas, salads and entrees and warm ciabatta rolls (gratis). Best French fries bar none. White cloth napkin service where you can begin educating the kids about table manners. Went to see the Jim Henson and muppets exhibit which was very interactive, great for adults and kids. Worth the drive over from the Getty center and the struggle on the 405 freeway.",Eutr
50,Go for the Noah Arc,"So Skirball is a place close to the Getty Center, and offers variety of choices - museum (rather small, but still can give you an idea of the Jewish culture and history), great library, screening and concert halls, and above all the Noah Arc! Even if you do not have kids, forget you are an adult already - go an check how Noah saved his nation, and the animals. Touch the science, play, have fun, learn again. It is so refershing!",786malgorzatac

50,SKIRBALL Majesty,"The Skirball is truly a gem. The grounds are rich with foliage and the mere existence of the museum is a testament to the human spirit. I loved visiting the Skirball for the exhibit, Another Promised Land: Anita Brenner's Mexico. While there, I was also able to see the Noah's Art exhibit and the Jewish Historical exhibit. My heart, intellect and spirit was thoroughly nourished during the visit. There is so much to learn about the human experience of people from other cultures and national origins. The Skirball is a wonderful place for this. The buildings are all of simple elegance that do not detract from any exhibit. There is also a cafe onsite with healthy, high-quality food and beverage options. Parking is free and easily accessible.",Rokc E
50,Highly recommend,Wonderful way to spend a day. Really beautiful. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Easy to get to . Allow enough time to walk around and see all.,Props555
50,Great Space,"Saw an author speak here and have to say it was a great experience. The acoustics are great, the chairs comfortable, parking easy. It's not the closest to LA but it is a great cultural center and I can't wait to go back to explore more.",KellermansFanClub
50,A must for people of all religions,We’ve seen the Skirball Cultural Center before. And this second visit reconfirmed our very positive opinion of the Center. The Jewish story from antiquity to the modern era is very well explained Sved illustrated with excellent displays and videos. Currently there is also a brilliant exhibition about ANITA BRENNER a historic artistic link between Mexico and the USHighly recommended,bigvicSydney
50,Something for Everyone,"I loved the grounds of this museum. The exhibits are varied, and have something for everyone. The Noah's Ark exhibit was extremely creative and well done. Loved the exhibit on the murals of Lisa Angeles, and the accompanying guide that lists where they are. The exhibit on Jewish Life was engaging. I would definitely go back. It is part of the Bank of America program, so with that debit or credit card you can enter for free on the first weekend of the month. Lovely, lovely place.",Mecca
50,Interesting for adults and children,"The Skirball Cultural Center offers an exhibition of Judaic culture. For the adults there are displays of art, and for the kids there is Noah's ark where kids can play with the exhibits while learning the biblical story.",dan g
50,You don't have to be Jewish,"Only saw about half of the center,but what I saw blew me away . Visited the Noah's ark exhibit. For creativity and resourcefulness 10/5. Yeah, that's 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. It's that good. Couldn't wipe the smile off my face. For an Angeleno, the exhibit on murals in the Los Angeles area is eye opening. I was more aware of murals, and looking for them on the way home. For out of towners, it's a treat to have a map of where to find these treasures. The Anita Brenner exhibit is intriguing because of her association with art world luminaries like Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. It's also sobering to read of the prejudice against Jewish people that she experienced in both Mexico and the U.S. Our time was limited, so we chose to leave the permanent exhibit for our next visit.",randylee223
50,A Thoughtful Journey,"When the Skirball first opened, I put it aside assuming that it would take a while before the crowds thinned out. And then of course, I forgot about it. And then one day, it occurred that I had yet to visit what has since become a cultural shrine. What an amazing gallery of such powerful works of art. Do yourself a favor: make the time to visit the Skirball. you will not be disappointed.",John O
50,Enjoyed it Very Much,"I've lived in LA for 13 years and a Paul Simon exhibit brought me to the Center. Afterwards, they had a live music concert in the Atrium...a fun night! Plus, this is also a serious museum of Jewish history.",billegee123
50,A Los Angeles GEM,One of the most interesting and educational museums that I have had the privilege to visit! We spent a wonderful 3 hours at the Skirball Center and could have stayed longer. This cultural center is for children and people of all ages and provides a wonderful insight into Judaism. Don't miss the opportunity to spend time at this beautiful facility.,GM-FLA
50,Excellent educational place to visit,"Was visiting Los Angeles and we had gone to an affair there. We had noticed that Paul Simon was performing there. We went to see the Paul Simon exhibit which was very well done and interesting. We also saw the Jewsh exhibit where there were many artifacts fromAncient times, the holocaust, modern times, and Jewish clothing. It was very interesting and we enjoyed it. We recommend going to this place as they are continually changing the exhibits. They also have a Noah's Ark which is an exhibit for children. Recommend for all ages.",Lodi48
50,"Best museum in LA for families, hands down","We have visited the Skirball center several times over the past three years and have never been disappointed with our experience. First, the Noah's Ark exhibit is one of the most interesting, innovative and enjoyable museum experiences I have had (and that's just from an adult's perspective). The kids love it! I love how they have a timed entry to limit the number of visitors at any one time, so the space never feels too crowded. My kids are always a bit afraid of the ""rain"" room but overall they can spend a full hour in the space and not get bored. I especially appreciate how the last room of the exhibit is always changing and always focused on a wonderful, child-appropriate message (most recently, offering different ways to children to build a ""home"", to tie in with another exhibit in the museum about Syrian refugees).Next, the outdoor space in the museum is plentiful and very peaceful. We love eating lunch out by the lily pad pond or in the ampitheater. The flow of indoor/outdoor space is great for young kids to break up the visit with some fresh air. The roof exhibit - an archealogical ""dig"" site - is another huge hit. My four year old son first thought he was digging for dinosaur bones but slowly started to understand the concept of looking for artifacts from an ancient city. Both he and my two year old daughter dug to their hearts' content and found tons of ""treasure."" What is so cool about this exhibit is it's actually challenging to find all of the artifacts - and it truly offers the kids a learning experience, as there is a tent set up right next to the dig sites that offers excellent learning materials (books, measuring tools, puzzles, etc.) to reinforce what the kids experienced at the dig. I have never seen a museum that offers children so MUCH in just one exhibit.Lastly, I have to mention the Skirball's outstanding art room. Every time we have gone the kids are able to make a truly original and fun work of art. The room is a crafter's dream - materials of all shapes, sizes, colors, textures, etc. all within arm's reach. Markers, crayons, glue, scissors, etc - everything you could need abounds and offers a child limitless creativity. Most recently, the kids built another version of a ""home"", cleverly tying together the theme of the earlier part of our visit in Noah's ark. This museum is just an extraordinary value for the price - so much to do in one visit and all of it different, fun and interesting.Oops, there's more I need to mention - the changing exhibit in the main part of the museum also always offers a great experience to families. The Paul Simon exhibit currently ongoing allows kids to touch, play with and experience all kinds of instruments - from electric to acoustic, from guitar to drum. Again, there is both an indoor and outdoor component to the exhibit - just so thoughtful and well planned out. I should also say we love that the fancy cafe/eatery has a casual, take out option right next door and the sandwiches are always good. And, most importantly, every employee I have spoken with during our visit has been EXCELLENT. Helpful, informative and most important to a mom, KIND to the kids and families who visit.if you haven't guess, I can't say enough good things about the Skirball museum. I hope it remains a place for our family to always have an educational and fun time! We love it!Tip: it's NOT worth it in my opinion to try to go on Thursdays for Noah's Ark when they offer free admission. The line is just too long and it is too hot to wait outside for tickets. while it's wonderful the Skirball offers this option, it is so much easier to buy tickets and just pay the entry price online. Just my opinion.",marieny524
40,Wonderful Visit,My wife and I came from Atlanta for a visit. At the suggestion of our son we went to the Skirball see the exhibit of Jewish life from antiquity to America and the Paul Simon exhibit. It was well worth the visit and we would have enjoyed staying longer but for our infant grandson who thought otherwise. On our way out we passed players putting on a performance about nature for the Center's summer program.Parking was not a problem when we were thee and the Center was handicapped friendly.,Bruce M
50,Los Angeles Slowly Becoming a Major Cultural Center,"Visitors of all ages will appreciate the current Paul Simon exhibition. However, visitors who grew up with the music of the 1960's will especially adore this exhibit. This duo rewrote pop music with their words of the musical composition, MRS ROBINSON, which was featured in THE GRADUATE, and actually helped change sound tracks for films. The exhibit shows the misguided information that Paul Simon received from music executive Clive Davis that when the duo broke up Davis told Simon that it was the biggest mistake of his life. Simon proved Davis wrong and went on to have an unbelievable solo career and his enduring legacy is still going on. The exhibit is wonderful and also not to be missed is the music lab with interactive exhibits. There is generally at least one docent led tour each day and one should call for information of the timing of these tours prior to going to the exhibit.",springpa
50,A Paul Simon erxhibit to share with grandchildren,Came here specifically to see the Paul Simon exhibit with my 14 year of grandson.

40,Skirball Cultural Center is Architectural Attraction,"Just the buildings and grounds are enough to warrant a visit. Beautiful land use and creative buildings and spaces.Inside. Is a wonderful permanent exhibition, Noah's Ark. Great for children. Traveling exhibitions on Jewish themes are popular.

50,Openness and culture.,"The Skirball Cultural Center is about as welcoming as any museum that I have ever experienced. Staff bend over backwards to see that you have enough information, guidance with exhibitions and food venues. We visited the Paul Simon exhibition which was laid out in such a way that you felt that you were in his apartment. Very clever presentation. Staff made a special effort when we asked if we could have a late lunch. The restaurant was closed but the Hungarian waitress came up with a solution, two chicken salads, and brought them out on to the terrace for us. We were gently reminded of the closing time allowing us to complete our tour of the exhibit. We had free entry as it was the first Thursday of the month. Parking is free, the attendant was helpful and everyone was exceedingly friendly. The ethos is that of inclusion from the Top Man right the way through to all the staff. A calm day in a beautiful setting with delightful people all around.",grantmccahon

We did have a few issues, we wanted to make people aware of!Location/venue: Beautiful, no problemsCoordination and pricing: Pricing was changed on us numerous times, including 2 days before the wedding. Definitely keep all documentation, this was eventually corrected, though with unnecessary hastle.Food: Was good. There were MANY complaints about the number of appetizers during cocktail hour, despite paying for plenty, we received minimal.

Lots of bold lines and dots, and although so simple, has subliminal messages and double meanings which are very thought provoking!The Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles itself is a small and quaint like museum, right off the 405 freeway!

The entrance fee was reasonable but the exhibit was actually quite small and disappointing. I was also a bit disappointed in the cafe as there is nothing else in the neighbourhood it would have been nice to enjoy a more robust cafe area rather than just the cart. The wifi was good, the outdoor space and staff were all lovely.",Kary A
50,A Wonderful Visit,"I have driven past the Skirball for years. The current exhibit of the Roy Lichtenstein collection drew me in for my first visit. I also wanted to see the much talked about Noah's Ark. Purchased tickets online, along with selecting a time frame to visit the Arc. The RL exhibit was fun, lots of different peices along with an interactive room that you can sit in and take pictures! The Arc come to find out is a big Playroom, that is why they monitor the entry times and the amount of time spent in the room. The younger loved it. Lots of interactive crank and pulleys, jungle gyms, tunnels. The younger kids can blow off some steam from allowing their parents to drag them around the rest of the museum. The Jewish history exhibit was beautiful as well. I had a lovely meal at the restaurant (an all vegetarian menu -- but you would never know it). The entry price was very reasonable and the parking is free! I had a great afternoon.",L P
50,Wonderful for families,"I have never been disappointed to see everything at the Skirball. I visited recently, with my 4 year old Grandniece, and my 6 year old Grandnephew, and I discovered Noah's Ark. Noah's Ark is so informative for children, and the experience for them is awesome. In addition, there is a collection of artwork from Roy Lichtenstein, which will be there through March.I returned a few weeks ago, and repeated the experience with an older couple, who had never been there before.

Admission is $12, but they are members of the North American Reciprocal Museums (NARM) so membership in one of those museums allows for free admission in to the Skirball.

50,"Art, History and Noah's Ark.","There is more to the Skirball Cultural Center than just a museum. There are two permanent exhibits, one on Jewish culture and the other on Noah's Ark. The Noah's Ark is very popular. Most of the animals sculptures are made partly of objects such as fly swatters, shoes and purses, mixing whips, and car parts. It is very much for children but adults with a creative eye can enjoy studying the construction of the animal sculptures. Throughout the Center are smaller exhibits showing ancient and recent artifacts.On this day we visited the ""Pop for the People"" exhibit which covered the art of Roy Lichtenstein, a Jewish pop artist from the 1950s and 1960s. There is a small exhibit space which was empty this day.On this rainy day, the dig site was closed. This is an area where children can pretend to be an archeologist looking for artifacts in the sand.Parking is free, which is rare in Los Angeles, although there is an admission fee. There is a café, gift shop, and several theaters and meetings areas.",Kenneth L
50,It's all about Noah's Ark,"This is a great museum, but it was Noah's Ark that anchored our visit. It was a great experience for our 4y/old.

40,Great museum,"As any attraction of this type, it's very much a matter of your own personal interests and tastes, but I find that the Skirball is one of the more consistently good visits. The temporary exhibits tend to be a bit more unusual and interesting than the standard art museums. The subject matter are a little more quirky and fun than you'l generally find. It really tells the story behind the work making it a real fun educational experience.The Jewish display is also very interesting and exhibited in a way that tells a great story.Overall, the Skirball is one of the lesser thought-of places in Los Angeles but should be high on your list if you're visiting the area or have guests in town. Especially if you don't want to just do the regular tourist attractions like the studio tours and Disneyland.",Valleyblue
40,I think they're scare of minorities,"I went here. I'm Asian American and almost everyone else was white with the exception of some security guards who appeared to be black. I don't think they are use to seeing minorities up here. They seemed to be totally scared of a 5 foot 4 inch Asian American and I'm quite normal looking. They seemed to be extra ""vigilant"". I noticed this too in the area of the Museum where stores were all white and security followed me around - quite obviously. What is this world coming to if the Skirball Cultural Center, which is predominantly Jewish, is afraid of anyone not white? Isn't one of the biggest groups to be fearful of - are the White Supremists?",D L

50,Noah's Ark exhibit--it doesn't get old!,"The Noahs Ark exhibit is just fantastic. The creativity here is overwhelming. Everything can be touched and climbed on and explored. My young kids, 5 years old down to crawling infants love this place. Thursdays are free but you have to get in line and hope for a ticket. It might be worth the price of admission to go on a non-Thursdays, guaranteeing you get in.",oohlaalaa
50,Take Me Out to the Ballgame!,"""Chasing Dreams"" is a special baseball exhibit at the beautiful Skirball Museum until October 30, 2016. What makes this exhibit unique is how it chronicles the inclusion of minorities into baseball and how they changed the game. Such players included Hank Greenberg, Sandy Koufax, Jackie Robinson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Ichiro Suzuki. More than 130 fascinating objects are on display including some items from the museum in Cooperstown.Also on display is a companion exhibit, ""The Unauthorized History of Baseball in 100 Odd Paintings: The Art of Ben Sakaguchi"". It is informative, historical and whimsical.Children will enjoy two interactive games where they can test their skills. A delightful family activity.",Jeanne S
50,Great for kids,"We went to Skirball a number of years ago to see a very interesting exhibit on Jewish Magicians. Our latest visit was to take the grandchildren to Noah's Ark, a permanent space for children. It is well done. A docent starts with the kids, explaining the story of Noah's Ark. Inside there are many kid friendly exhibits. The grandchildren really enjoyed it. They also have a simulated archeological dig outside on the top floor. The kids get to dig in the sand to find artifacts. Another hit. Lot's going on there. Check the website before going.",Mark S
50,"Wonderful exhibits, exhibits, restaurant and venue for proms and weddings!","I originally went to the Skirball when it first opened to see the permanent exhibits and was enthralled. I had to go back several times. Now I go with my grandchildren to the ""Noah's Ark"" exhibit.This isn't a religious exhibit, but an interactive, fun exhibit that has lots of activities from climbing to building things, playing with puppets and stuffed animals to music and other activities. My grandchildren currently range from 4 1/2 to 16 months; they all love Noah's Ark! My granddaughter was a little nervous the first time we went but ever since, she can't get enough.The Skirball also has excellent lectures and programs for adults as well as an incredible Kosher restaurant. Don't worry about the restaurant if you're not Jewish - everyone seems to enjoy it.One thing that I want to add is that one of the times that I visited the Skirball was for a high school prom. The venue is beautiful and the food was incredible! I've been to many high school proms at various venues and the food here was outstanding! ;The prom was outdoors in a beautiful area and there was plenty of room for all of the kids (I believe there were more than 400 students). They provided a beautiful private room for the chaperones too.I should say that I've also been to a few luncheons which everyone enjoyed too. The only negative was that when I was looking for venues for my daughter's wedding, I was told that people start reserving 18 months before the wedding. :( My daughter didn't want to wait that long.",Jane B
30,"If You Want a ""Lite"" Overview of Jewish Culture, This is the Place","Perhaps I was underwhelmed by this museum because I have been to Israeli museums, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, have traveled and have read many books, so my perspective is skewed. The Skirball has a very nice building but the subject of Jewish culture is touched upon only on the surface here. It is probably fine for the non-Jewish person who is looking for an overview. I have seen many of the ""artifacts"" in the homes of people I know. The Noah's Ark exhibit is good for families and children of all faiths, but wasn't that interesting to my adult self. The museum is free on Thursdays, which made the price right for us. There is a lovely gift shop.",edyrp
40,Quite nice - and the frogs agree!,"Peaceful location. Decent public hall. Very convenient parking. And a pond, with the most loquacious frogs on the planet. Stay for the frogs.",Primo54
50,My next summer programs will include the Skirball,"I was there for the first time on Feb 17th for the Dave Stewart's book presentation, it was at night so I didn't have the chance to see all the Center, but I ran into a Skirball's volunteer at Dave's presentation and he told me that there's a free summer concerts programs and even you can have dinner while attending to the shows that are held on an open area. It sound really attractive so I'll came back next summer.",Gus6
50,The best Turkey dinner in Los Angeles,"I know the title of my review is odd as one does not think to visit the Skirball Center to have dinner per se.I had the pleasure of attending a private event here a while ago where one of the meat selections was turkey as the meat served with dinner and it was the best turkey I have ever eaten. This includes smoked turkey from southern relatives.I am not sure if it was the chef at the time who cooked this delectable bird or if it is a staple dish on their menu regardless of who the chef happens to be. Besides being a great venue for events due to the architecture, I highly recommend it as a dining destination.",Dale O
50,Great exhibits and dining spot,Different exhibits focusing on many aspects of history. Over have specialty lectures relating to exhibits. Docent tours available. Dining locations have a variety of foods- good for lunch or just a coffee/tea. Location has many places for a quiet reflection or a small gathering .,FranChasen
40,MANZANAR CAMP ON PHOTOGRAPHS,"Visiting the exhibition Manzanar; the Wartime Photographs in the Skirball Center is one of the most recommendable cultural activities that you can do in Los Angeles. This exhibition displays pictures took by the photographer Ansel Adams in the camp of Manzanar, which is about 3 hours away from LA, and it was used by the American government as an incarceration camp for all the Japanese-Americans during World War II. I think this exhibit is very interesting because it shows the War from a point-of-view that we had never realized even existed. My whole family attended on Sunday morning, and all of us enjoyed it. Be aware, the exhibition is running only this month (February, 16).",FernandodeMarcos
50,"""Fantastic Museum Experience""","While in Los Angeles, visiting our daughter and her family, we had an opportunity to take our almost four year old twin (a boy and a girl) grandchildren on ""adventures"" twice a week. The Skirball Cultural Center...with it's Noah's Ark exhibit became an immediate and often requested place to go! With the many hands-on and interactive opportunities it offers, Noah's Ark was artistically created, imaginative, colorful, fascinating and ingenious! Several young museum docents were available to both answer questions, provide guidance and monitor the activity in the Ark. We were so impressed that we recommended the Skirball to other family and friends. It is definitely ""a must see to believe"" experience! :) Free to the public on Thursday.",Mary Jo S
40,Surprisingly good,"Came here for the Ansel Adams exhibit. This is my first visit to the Center and I find the place very enchanting. The surrounding was pleasant and relaxing despite being so close to the freeway. I especially enjoyed the Noah's Ark, who said its for kids only. I think the adults would enjoy it too as everything is cleverly designed and made from wasted material. Give it a try, you will not regret it. Parking is free and entrance fee is only $10. You can get in free if you have other museum membership affiliated western museums.",RRla
50,In L.A.? Go here.,"What a gem of a Museum! And it's really so much more than that. Performance spaces (inside and out). A great little cafe. All sorts of permanent and temporary exhibits.

And bring the kids and the seniors and the out of town guests.",frankellen178
50,Noah's Arch is a must,"This has kept me going back a few times. I can't recommend it enough. It is great for children, maybe up to 7-8 yrs old. Love it! I have also gone to a few concerts, indoors and out. Their website is very user friendly and if you sign up for the newsletter , you get emails ahead so you can make reservations. The rest of the exhibits are hit and miss (in my opinion)",freemaee
50,Beautiful Facility,"We went on Thursday - each Thursday is free so you cannot beat the price! Beautiful facility, very helpful staff.in addition to the permanent exhibits they had wonderful exhibits related to the Japanese Internment camps in the US during the 1949's. We did two docent-lead tours and they were wonderful. The facility is beautiful and well laid out, with a nice snack bar and a restaurant and a couple of courtyards, so it is kid-friendly. Wonderful place to spend a couple of hours when in LA.",Robert V
50,interesting and thought provoking,"current exhibits focus on the injustice and human cost associated with the mistreatment of west-coast Japanese-American citizens in WWII. the permanent exhibits describe the Jewish community and its history. Access to the center is easy, including Metro buses which stop about a block away. parking is easy. there is a restaurant that serves a variety of tasty dishes. clearly, worth a trip",jeffrey k

30,"OK permanent collection with interesting, changing exhibitions","Every time I visit the Skirball I'm conflicted. It's located in a beautiful, easy to access location not far from my home. The problem is whether or not it's a museum or a cultural center (however that's defined). As a museum it's only so so as far as the permanent exhibitions go, including Noah's Ark (boring after the 1st time even with little children!) The saving grace here are the rotating exhibitions which tend to be excellent. For my family it's the only thing which keeps us coming back. We're here about twice a year and that sounds about right. If you're visiting from out of town and can only choose 1 or 2 ""cultural"" activities in LA sadly the Skirball wouldn't be one of them.",Mark J
40,Come to See Noah's Ark,"One of the best things about this small but impressive museum is the two room Noah's ark exhibit that immerses that visitors in the ark.

The Noah's Ark exhibit was spectacular. Our grandson spent an hour playing and climbing and having a good time. The exhibit is very creative with all the animals made from household items.And then the was the special exhibit - till Oct 11 - on Bill Graham and rock n roll. Brought back lots of memories. Lots of old photos and posters and guitars.The permanent museum is also very worthwhile.Admission is reasonably priced. Senior tickets available. But get there early.,Sa-i44

40,Kids LOVE Noah's Ark,"Skirball Center is okay, sometimes they have interesting exhibits. However, Noah's Ark - the permanent exhibit - is a MUST place for the little ones up to about age 8 or 9. Adults love the myriad of animals cobbled together out of different materials because they're so damn inventive and creative. Kids LOVE climbing around the different mazes and climbing areas. In the back of the Ark they have activities, like playing musical instruments, which my kids enjoyed. Also, in the summer (I believe) there is an arts and crafts room where the kids can make projects while they await their turn at Noah's Ark. Don't take my word for it but I think the museum is free on Thursdays.",Charles Z

50,Noah's Ark,"This is a wonderful place to bring children probably up to the age of 10 years old. For two hours, children from toddlers on can interact with 5 rooms of Ark related activities, making lightening and rain, building the ark, moving a giraffe's head, climbing on the ropes of a boat, playing with dozens and dozens of toy animals, with rooms for supplies, and with simple instruments in the finale where young people participate in making music. The last room also has full craft tables. Many of the dozens of animals are actually make from common objects, brooms, tires, fans and what is fun is identifying the parts of the animals made from objects with which kids, or adults are familiar.Reservations are advised and the cost is modest.Skirball also has wonderful adult exhibits. There is a very fine cafe and space outdoors to eat.",Alice C

Older kids are given more complex questions and get a more robust experience.Older children will benefit from experiencing the Jewish history exhibit.Every Thursday is free day. And Skirball participates in the BofA Museums on Us program, so the first full weekend each month is free. Free parking.They are also offering evening music and other events on campus, so check the website for more options.If you are looking for a lunch spot without leaving, Zeidler's Cafe is a phenomenal option with reasonable prices.

50,Bill Graham Exhibit... Thanks for the memories,"The ultimate promoter!! The Skirball is a Jewish Cultural Center. The first part of the exhibit focuses on his early life. He was Jewish, born in Berlin January 8, 1931. His father died 2 days after he was born. He was fortunate to leave Nazi Germany. He was sent to France where he ended up between the front lines after the Nazis invaded France. He was able to leave France and come to the United States where he was adopted by a family in the Bronx.Only in America could a poor Jewish boy become the world's greatest concert promoter. The majority of the exhibit is his work with the major bands in the 60's, 70's and 80's. He presented all the greatest bands. There are posters, pictures, costumes and guitars. There is a light show.Oh! what memories. Where are my tie died t-shirts and my bell bottom pants? I don't have all my records but I do have all my memories.We had lunch at the cafe. It was very good.There is an exhibit about the rock and roll billboards on Sunset boulevard. It was interesting.",Charles W

40,Great fun for the kids and the entire family~,"Our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 small kids) visited the Skirball Cultural Center today while in L.A. visitng my parents. From what I hear, this Center is not very well known among tourists to this area, but it sure is a hidden gem, especially for kids. The parking here is free, but there is an admissions fee (US$10 per person for adults and US$5 per child over 2). The Noah's Ark, which is a permanent exhibition here, is simply great for kids. The kids get to actively partake in the activities. My kids who are 3, 6, and 8 really enjoyed it. The special exhibit for now is the Bill Graham and the Rock & Roll Revolution. This takes one back to the rock n' roll era of the 60's and 70's. My kids were not thrilled about this exhibit, but it was somewhat interesting for me. After the visit, we ate late lunch at the cafe within the Center. The food (pizza, sandwich, salad, etc.) was very good and the price was reasonable as well.

The Centre is situated right across the freeway, from the American Jewish University. The museum is nicely laid out, and there are a couple of guided-tours each day. It is helpful to phone ahead and book a time, which also helps with parking. After the guided tour, one is free to walk around the rest of the exhibits, or spend some time with exhibits that you would like more time with.

50,Noah's Ark-Interactive Exhibition. Great place to take your younger kids,"We went here over the weekend, we specifically went for the Noah's Ark exhibition. This is great for children between 2-7. It is all interactive. This is a great experience for children to learn about history by being involved in the process. I was very impressed by all the different aspects of it and my 4 year old son enjoyed it very much. I will not get into talking about the exhibit, it's best if you go experience it yourself. It's worth your time and money. The ticket prices are very reasonable and also grants you access to the other galleries at the Skirball. Parking is free and covered. They have two hour time slots every 30 minutes so that there is a limted number of people inside at one time which makes the experience more enjoyable without a major crowd. Although their website states that advance tickets are recommended, we were able to get same day tickets at the admissions desk.",cbca961

There are cargo nets to climb, whites to send things down, blocks to build with, noises to make and fun to be had. On the weekends at least there are crafts to do with staff assistance, which are simple but fun. My 3 year old niece was in heaven and children 2-3 years older were having a great time too.

We had stickers on that admitted us for 2 hours.First, we went to see the Noah's Ark exhibit which was really great. It showed great detail and imagination in it's uses of recycled objects made into animals. There was lot of things for the kids to do including climbing, pressing buttons, rotating cranks and they saw what each thing did. Very interactive and visually interesting.Then we did the dig which is on the roof. The kids just loved digging for artifacts (especially since my 4th grader is learning about ancient Egypt in school). They had a tent near the artifacts with this multilayer puzzle that was cool, and other learning opportunities.The cafe was nice and we enjoyed a quick bite to eat. The architecture of the building and the grounds were magnificient. We truly enjoyed our visit and wish that we would have been able to explore more of the exhibits.",jillshari

The tour was well handled, the exhibit clear and informative. I've been to the Skirball to view the permanent exhibit, ""Noah's Ark,"" which is not only fun for the kids, but imaginative interactive fun for the whole family.

The museum exhibits cover lots of ideas, subjects and should be interesting to anyone who loves museums. I would recommend it to anyone who loves History, Art, Science, Religion. It is not a place if you have a lot of questions. If you want to guide yourself through a museum this is the perfect place. We didnt see any workers/volunteers once we were past the front door. They have options for wheel chairs etc, but it is a walk for the rest of us. Kids will love parts of it.",Nanwil
40,Noah's Ark is a Must See for the Family,"I took my 1 1/2 year-old here and it turned into a great family outing. Noah's Ark is a must see! The kids will love it. There are so many things that they can see, touch and climb on. And parents will enjoying looking at how they made all of the animals out of re-purposed materials. They also have an arts & crafts room in the back and downstairs and do periodic ""circle time"" activities like a drum circle.Parking is conveniently located in the adjacent garage and they even had umbrellas for guests to use on a rare rainy day between the garage and the building. All of the staff (ticket counter, security, docents) were very friendly.By having a timed ticket to get into Noah's Ark, they do a good job trying to manage how many kids are in the space at one time. Still, I would recommend going first thing in the morning on weekends. We were even able to get tickets the same day close to when they opened.",MayaD888
50,Must go see the new permanent exhibit of Noah's Ark,"The Noah's Ark exhibit is just amazing. Many interactive activities. Loved the collaboration of artists, architects, engineers.

I plan to make this a regular stop when in LA. Was parking. Small venue makes it very doable with limited time.",Phyllis B
50,Noah's Ark Exhibit,"In my opinion, this exhibit is great for kids under the age of 8. My kids are 2 and 4 and they enjoyed this very much. There are 3 rooms total. One with animals made out of recycled materials, one for outside the ark, and one for arts and crafts. The best part is that they can actually touch everything in the exhibit from feeding the animals, learning how to create lightning, hearing the sound of a storm, flooding the ark, and loading the animals two by two onto the ark. There is also an area where they cook and clean. My older son was fascinated by the fake animal poop (yes, poop!) that you can clean up. There is a second floor where kids can climb up to using ropes. The last room is for arts and crafts where kids can create their own ark. We spent a total of 3 hours at the exhibit including the archeological dig on the top floor. There was story time too.Kids under 2 are free. Visits are timed (2 hours) so it doesn't get crowded for the kids and parents. We arrived at 1 p.m. and we had a whole room to ourselves at one point. I suggest getting the tickets online in advance and also to check for additional events going on during your visit.",hmajuelo

50,What a wonderful surprise!,We happened upon the museum and visited largely because of an exhibit on Émigrés and American cinema in the 1930s and 40s. What a terrific exhibit. It was well defined and laid out. Terrific!,LuvTaTrek
30,Nice for an Afternoon,"I mostly like seeing their new exhibits. I've been here too many times for school field trips to get excited about their permanent exhibits. My daughter went on a few too many trips with her Jewish day school classes. It seemed to be an annual trip. She's out of college now,and wants nothing to do with it. We've had a membership there,but not sure it's worth the money to keep it up.",madartist54
50,A must if you have kids:,"I am almost scared to write on here about Noah's ark. I don't wanted to become too popular!But this is one of the most creative, beautiful, relaxing children's museums/experiences that I know of. You get to experience these wonderful interactive installations that are composed of uniquely assembled pieces made out of every day objects.Especially nice for parents who are by themselves with more than one kid, Noah's Ark is enclosed so you can have your kids with you but not worry about one wandering off into a faraway place.",arielmc
50,Hollywood Event at the Skirball Cultural Center,"I recently attended a large-scale event at the Skirball Cultural Center. The facilities are beautiful, and the gardens are magnificent. I was very impressed by the high quality of the food and the friendly staff.",Jonathan A
50,A wonderful museum for the family,This is a gorgeous modern jewish cultural museum. Beautiful Judaica collection. There is a room with a Noah's Ark on which children can climb and play. There are animal puppets which are plentiful. Portholes to climb up to and look out. Cranks to turn to make thunder and lightening. Crafts and children's concerts on the weekend. The Noah's Ark room has 2 hour timed tickets.The museum caters to families and has a private room for nursing and diapering baby.Impressive special exhibits.gourmet restaurant on premises that is far above any museum food I have ever eaten and compares favorably with any good restaurant.,Beth K
40,Another excellent LA cultural stop,"We went to the Skirball for the first time this week. We did not go with children. We did not see the iconic Noah's Ark exhibit. This is a Jewish-sponsored and themed center, and what they do, they do well. The exhibit on now - for several months - is a 3-part show on immigrants to the US who fled the Holocaust and became part of the film industry in California. It's a fascinating exhibit highlighting the ways in which their experiences in Europe informed their work in the U.S. Think Casablanca.",Dianne B
40,Noah's Ark tips and highlights,"We've been to Skirball Center for the Noah's Ark exhibit multiple times. I usually come on free Thursdays or Bank of America Saturday (free for card holders). On Saturdays, they have quality shows like dancing and singing from different cultures. Don't miss the art room located downstairs. They have rotating themes and they are always good, with lots of materials to make your artwork. Noah's Ark itself is fun for the kids. My kids like to sweep the floor with toy mops. lol. It is not very big, so we are done in one hour or so. One tip on free Thursdays - they do not give out the Noah's Ark tickets online anymore. Show up on or before noon to guarantee entry to Noah's Ark. If it is at capacity, the time entry will be for a later time like 2p or 3p. In that case, we have lunch at the cafe. The food and service is quite good. It is also kids friendly.",memorybau
30,Check for exhibits before going - but a lovely stroll either way,"We headed to Skirball basically just to beat the heat as it was over 107 that day. Unfortunately there were no exhibits when we visited (just the permanent exhibit and Noah's Ark) so there wasn't much to do, but we did very much enjoy the permanent exhibit on Jewish Heritage and the well done spaces throughout. A quick pop into Noah's Ark was a little too crowded but interactive and neat to see briefly. I would probably check back when other things opened and maybe give this a second try.",Leigth M
40,Noah's Ark was cool!,"We didn't really see much other than Noah's Ark and the ""Snowy Day"" exhibit but those were both nice. Unfortunately we had to cut our visit short so I don't know what else was there.",AKO661

50,A surprise in LA,"During our visit with family in LA, we experienced a hidden family treasure - the Skirball Cultural Center. It was a very pleasant surprise. Our grandchildren (ages 6,4 and 1) loved it. I guarantee that they will be happy and content in the hands-on activities and programs. The two storied Noah's Ark room is a favorite! Adults will also enjoy the experience!",William Francis
30,"Sounds Mixed: Stage Superb, Audience Loud","I attended the Haden Triplets evening recently and my response is very conflicted. The artists were phenomenal. The space is beautiful and comfortable. I also had the dinner beforehand and it was delicious.But the acoustics and the audience and staff behavior was kind of appalling. People in the audience seemed to think they were in their own backyards and felt free to chat - loudly and often. Even the staff thought it was ok to talk and joke with each other as they walked on the sides of the audience section. ?????? They had their walkie talkies at full blast and were generally oblivious to the fact that a concert was going on.And what was probably the most disturbing was that the venue had a table set up for membership, or some kind of thing that you had to sign up for, and they were actively and LOUDLY signing people up during the concert. I was absolutely stunned.I guess you get what you pay for, which is nothing. (although the parking was $10)I doubt if I will ever attend a concert there again.",Judy S
30,Very Nice just not on my Top 20 List of things to see and do In LA; Top 25 Yes!,"Went on a Friday Afternoon, No issue with parking, very professional and helpful staff and security officers. The place is quiet and peaceful. Lots of history. Lots of art exhibits. Learned a few things such as Levi Strauss beginning and what Spain did to the Jewish People in 1492. The grounds were beautiful. I would love to come back for a concert. The admissions is waived once a week. check out the website. There is a cafe but it closes at 3PM I think. Make reservations for the Noah Ark experience. They were sold out when we got there. Nothing bad, I just didn't get what I needed. Perhaps, I was too depressed from missing the famous Noah Ark experience. I also learned about Jewish people in China back in the 1000 - 1200 years. I think kids would enjoy about 50% of the facility which is very good compared to other places.",jdreynoldsjr
50,Great first time visit,"We took the kids (1,4, and 5 years old) for a visit and everyone had a good time on our first visit.Finding the center was very easy since it is located right off the freeway. Free parking which is always a plus.All of the workers were very helpful and friendly. We spent a half day here and ended up getting an annual family membership, which will pay itself off with 2 additional visits.The museum has random events and performances and we happened to catch some Filipino folk dancing at the outdoor theatre that day, which was excellent.The kids loved Noah's Ark, and we spent the bulk of our time there. Even our one year old had fun exploring the two rooms, which had tons of interactive things to do for all the kids. The entrance tickets to the Ark are timed and you get to spend 2 hours inside. I like that they limit the amount of people allowed inside at a particular time, which gives everyone plenty of time to explore without having to deal with large crowds.We had lunch at the café which was nice. Nothing spectacular with the food but everything was satisfying.We will definitely be back again...",tygerstile
40,Half-day Fun,"It was a lovely place to spend most of the afternoon.Exhibitions: Noah's Ark is great for kids, Ezra Jack Keats' illustrations were great fun - certainly puts a smile on anyone's face. Noah's Ark has a lovely 2-room playground for the kids.The sandwiches & salads on offer were also very delicious and you could sit outside by the pond with water lilies. Or opt for a sit-down menu inside at the restaurant.PS; All exhibitions are free on Thursdays, otherwise $10 each for adults. Free parking!",cakesandtravel
50,wonderful experience,"Took in the Noah's Ark exhibit recently at the Skirball---wonderful and enthralling for people of all ages...plus the museum itself is engaging, featuring a changing roster of interesting exhibits. Another bonus: the cafeteria is attractive and the portions hearty, a rarity for museum based dining.",David L
40,Jewish Heritage,The permanent exhibits are still relevant and inviting. Easy to go through and each time your eye catches something else. The current temporary exhibit about Keats was fun and appropriate for all ages.,Garri R
40,pleasant surprise,"We went out of curiosity as a couple friends had taken their kids and enjoyed it. The installation called ""noah's ark"" was cute and creative, primarily oriented toward kids so worth a visit if you have young ones.",WestwoodTrekker
50,Very educational,"We have been to the Noah's Arc twice, once when my daughter was 3 years old and recently (now she is 7). I think she was more vowed when she was 3 but now as a 7 year old, she understood how they made things and why it's so impressive. It's very creative and hands on. We participated in the music demonstration and got to try different instruments from Africa and it was fun for her. A little harder for her to clime through the rope ladder etc.If you go to Noah's Arc, you are allowed to go to the other exhibitions also. We went to 2 other and it was so educational. One of them was about the Jews history and other one was about Green living for multifamily.We were there until the place closed down, about 4 plus hours. There gift shop has interesting things also.",Indiantraveler
50,Noah's Ark,"We visited the museum this weekend and had an awesome time. We took our one year old to explore Noah's Ark and he loved it. Everyone was very friendly and informative. He loved playing and being able to touch everything in the exhibit. Also they have an archeology dig on the second floor and the attendant was very helpful and sweet. I would not recommend the rest of the museum for toddlers, but the gardens were kid friendly.",Maria V
40,"Not overwhelming, but interesting and worthwhile","We visited the museum of Jewish history. It was not huge, but I learned a few things. The pattern of the Jewish diaspora was simple: allow Jews into a country because they would be of economic benefit, envy of Jewish success and prejudice would lead to persecution and segregation ending in expulsion or genocide. The good news is they haven't been wiped out yet and along the way have made significant contributions to mankind.We hadn't intended on going, but we got lost and we just happened on the place. We thought we would kill a couple of hours there, as we were too tired at that point to go where we originally wanted. And it was worth the time. If you are unfamiliar with their history, I think you will find it interesting and worthwhile, too.",JJJC_Family
30,I wish I liked it more,But the parking was difficult. The collection so so. It's just hard to compete with Getty and others on. Museum Row.,labonnevie
50,Beautiful Place with a Wealth to Share,"The grounds and museum space are stunning. The staff friendly. The shop fabulous. They carry many handmade and fair trade items. The museum has special traveling exhibits on an ongoing basis that are typically worth visiting. Noah's Ark is a fabulous exhibit...an amazing space for playing with and teaching children. The main exhibit not only teaches much about Jewish history, but also has exhibits that teach tolerance and understanding. Many exhibits are interactive. Free parking. Put this museum on your list of things to do. You do not need to be Jewish to find the trip to Skirball worthwhile.",Nancy D
50,A different view of judaica in LA,Not a typical museum about the typical life of Jews in America throughout the centuries. Noah's Ark is worth the admission price alone.,Jack S
40,Great Wedding Venue,Our friend's daughter got married here. It was a good place for such ocassion. It's a private place that and you feel the eclusivity of high end venue and celebration. The food choice you cater is ok but it depends of course of what you choose and how much money you want to spend.,VenDavid001
50,Worth A Visit,"We went to the Skirball Center last week when my parents were in town visiting, and we all absolutely loved it. The grounds are very pretty and peaceful to walk around, but it's the content of their collections that are so powerful. One of our favorites was their central collection called ""Visions And Values"" in which they showcase the experienes of Jews all over the world throughout history. In particular we loved seeing the various Chanukiahs (Hanukkah Menorahs) from all over the world. You could really see the love and attention put into these works of art.There was a beautiful Holocaust memorial as well, which was very moving because my family has several Holocaust survivors in it, including my dad who was with us.Noah's arc was a beautiful exhibit with a life sized replication of the arc itself. All of the animals exhibited were crafted from various reclaimed materials. Although we enjoyed this exhibit, it's extremely clear that it's geared towards children as opposed to adults. So if you want something fun to do for an afternoon with kids, definitely count this place as a contender.I highly recommend visiting the Skirball (and the nearby Getty Center) for a good dose of culture and beauty in Los Angeles.",beachycali
50,The Place to Have A Wedding,"We had our daughter's wedding at the Skirball this past summer. The staff were accommodating and helpful. The site is one of those all inclusive places where you can have the wedding and the reception following in one place. This is helpful in LA where traffic can be a challenge. We found the costs in line with other places and the staff really accommodated our requests. A special note, the underground parking is really nice. Once all the freeway construction is done in 2014, this place will be a great place.",BoboTravlr
50,Great exhibit!,"We did not have a lot of time today but wanted to check out the Moshe Safdie exhibit. There was a 45 minute tour accompanying the exhibit which showed pictures and models of 30 years of Moshe Safdie's work. It was very in depth, very educational and there were about 25 of us in the tour so very popular as well. We walked quickly thru the rest of the museum and the exhibits looked great, but the building by itself is worth seeing.Parking is free on site.",rduinc

50,A Terrific Venue,"Skirball is set atop a hill overlooking the LA basin and the San Fernando valley. It's setting is just the first of its spectacular features.

50,not to be missed if you visit Los Angeles,"We live in West Los Angeles, but always make a point of taking visitors to the Skirball.

50,Oh to be a child again,"The Skirball Cultural Centre is an absolute must for any one with children. Yes, it it a Jewish cultural centre which looks at the history of the Jewish people and their assimilation into American life and this I found very interesting indeed. However, the story of the Ark and their wonderful wooden Ark with hands on features where children can make the sound of rain, wind, thunder, lightening etc. Animals which can be made to move and opportunities to listen and participate in storytelling, music making etc all help to make this a childrens' paradise. Its great for grown ups to with films and exhibits showing all aspects of Jewish history plus a really good restaurant with good menu choices, good prices and excellent portions. Jewish or not(I'm not) you will not be disappointed with this cultural gem.",Maria S
50,Mideast Meets West,"Even for a lifelong New Yorker living in NY for 60+ years, I am blown away by this cultural center of the Jewish people. The setting alone is remarkable; a modern building perched on a hill overlooking valleys reminiscent of Jerusalem. The permanent exhibit is a beautifully conceived and executed combination of historical objects and settings of Jewish life. The gift shop has unique gifts and games for children. Last time I was there there was an exhibit of home movies from the early Jewish settlers in the 1930's until today. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this innovative cultural center.",Frankie7378
50,If you come to LA with Children - A Must,"Skirball is a real nice small museum with interesting exhibits. However, what I LOVE best about the museum is going out there with my grandkids. They have a section called Noah's Arc that is just heaven for kids, and the adults who love watching your kids. So many activities for the kids, and many planned special event. You will need to also check their calendar. Very important - it is very popular place for parents and grandparents therefore, you need to make reservations (on-line or phone) ahead of time for Noah's Arc. They will not let you in without reservations!In addition, at summer time, every Thursday evening they have a free musical or theatrical events, really great shows. Again check their calendar. Advice - since it is free and good, if you want to get any seats or at least good seats, plan to show up earlier.",Tirza_ha
50,Simply the best,"I sat there wondering how we can get a Noah's ark in London. My children spend hours every summer and never get bored. It is beautiful, imaginative and so well constructed. LA is lucky lucky lucky. Keep it up and let us all in on the secret of how we can bring something like it to other parts of the world!",hnya
50,Free quality entertainment,"Besides the nice exhibits, the Skirball offers free summer concerts on Thursday's night featuring interesting bands, playing a variety of world music. They are very organized, and tickets are distributed on first come, first served basis. Every 5 minutes, a group of about 30 are let in, so there is no rush. Inside they offer reasonable pre packed salads, sandwiches and a limited bar, but with a nice selection. Overall its a fun event in the open courtyard at the center. There is room for dancing in front of the stage, and many people do. Enjoy diverse music for free (paid parking is available for $10). The free tickets are distributed starting at 5:30, and they let people in at 7pm, concerts start at 8 pm, ends around 10pm. Good for the whole family.",Ronwol
50,Hidden Gem,"I LOVE the Skirball! Great food in the café at mid-range prices and nice-sized portions. Beautiful jewelry and Judaica ritual items in the gift shop. The permanent collection of Noah's Ark is one of the best places for kids to play in L.A. The other part of the permanent collection is a well-curated zip through Jewish culture and the immigration-to-America experience. Don't miss the free summer world music series of Sunset Concerts - 6 Thursdays in the summer. If you buy tickets to the delicious pre-concert buffet ($22), the Skirball will save seats for you at the concert - no waiting in line.",RabbiWendy

40,"Small, but enjoyable museum with a focus on Jewish heritage","Located at the top of the 405 pass to the Valley, near Mulholland, and just north of the Getty, this modern facility provides both a permanent museum display on the history of the Jewish peoples, including a poignant memorial to victims of the holocaust. In addition to the permanent exhibits, there are changing exhibitions. We saw the Gary Baseman exhibit, and were fortunate enough to meet him while he was giving a guided tour of his exhibition. A fascinating presentation in the style of a house, decorated by his creations. Well worth a visit. In addition, there is a shop and a children's play area - Noah's Ark (not used by our group but looked popular, and had timed admissions to control crowds). We caught part of an outdoor 'bottle dance' in their small terraced amphitheatre - clearly for the young ones! With reasonable admission fees and free parking, a 1-2 hour visit is adequate.",CollectingChristie
40,A cultural experience!,"This Jewel of a find is located along 405 freeway. We went on a Thursday and was so happy because it was free day! It gives you a history of Jewish Americans and displays images of famous, & notable people like Einstein... We enjoyed looking at the exhibit of Gary Basemans works. The kids loved Noahs ark, it is an interactive play area, recreating the ark and the animals with recycled materials. Don't forget to go to the archeologist dig! the museum opens 12-5 usually, so plan your trip to avoid the 405 traffic.",tameia

I learned a lot, and had a great time. If you’ve got a family, this is a wonderful place to spend a Sunday.

Exhibits and artifacts cover the history of the Jewish people from ancient times to the modern era. Very good interactive exhibits, videos, and other multimedia. Great place for kids.

40,The Skirball can be a ball,"After my daughter's took me on a surprise visit to the Skirball for Noah's Ark, I became a member of the Cultural Center and got an extra membership so I could take friends. There were so many things to do over the year from Magic Shows to movies to other exhibits. I think it's a fabulous place for all kinds of things, but start with Noah's Ark - no mattter how old you are.",latrvlr
50,Noah's Arc is a must see,"Noah's arc is a must see. Although designed for kids, the creativity is worthwhile for adults to experience.I've enjoyed several other exhibits as well, especially the comic book related ones.",SeaJenniTravel
40,Depends on the exhibit,Nice building. Interesting target demographic. They do some very interesting programming. So if there's something on that you're interested in...then get on over.,anadamansea

50,Great exhibits and great staff,"My 20 year old daughter visited the Noahs Ark exhibit, Woman Who Hold Half the Sky exhibit and the restaurant.We enjoyed the Skirball from beginning to end, the weather was perfect too this time of year.The Noahs Ark exhibit is for younger children, it is an interactive exhibit and though we are not young, both of us thoroughly enjoyed it.We had lunch at Zeidler's Cafe, we recommend the Ceasar salad, we added grilled salmon which was not on the menu, but they didn't have grilled chicken..it was great...I had the Nicoise salad with ranch dressing and it was good. Their passion tea was also very good.",sparkyme
40,School house to comics,"There is so much to see, and contrasts galore. I saw the animal creations with the children, the comic book section, and the school house of days gone by... what an eclectic arrangement. I wanted to stay longer, but had to leave when my friends were ready to go. But I want to go back again.",Linda A
50,Skirball,"A great LA destination. The site is terrific. The varying exhibits are worth several visits. The restaurant is also good.However, construction at this time makes access somewhat difficult.",golfandbeach
50,Nice setting,Many cultural events and never was I disappointed attending,stella_sl
30,Could be so much more.,"The Skirball museum is a disappointment. We went there a couple of months ago expecting to spend a full afternoon. It turned out that ninety minutes was more than enough time to see the permanent exhibit (on the history of the Jewish people) and the temporary exhibit that was included in the basic admission price (women hold up half the sky.) The temporary exhibit was nothing more that a couple dozen stories about oppressed women around the world, tacked onto partition dividers. (Certainly, those women deserve better than that.) The permanant exhibit was very well done, but also very small. With all the things the Jewish peolple have experienced in the last 3,000 years, I would have expected much more.",Atkinson
50,A great historical site,"It doesn't matter what your religion, this place is awesome! We are not Jewish but thouroughly enjoyed the displays & culture depicted. An afternoon well spent.",tedandbarbfromla

50,Great museum,Wonderful building and very interesting objects of history. Different and terrific.,Harris14
50,Had a great time at Noah's Ark and the Archaeological dig,"My 3 year old son and 6 year old daughter loved the Skirball museum. We went on Saturday so the archeology pits were open (big sandboxes filled with old clay pots, etc. for the kids to dig up). Then they could measure and weigh them, draw a picture, and describe what it was. Noah's ark is 4 huge rooms of wonderful animals made out of ""everyday"" items like bathtubs, whisks, piano keyboards, etc. The ark itself was a play structure the kids could climb in. There were also building activities, dancing and more. Both kids had a great time and fell asleep on the way home.",hkkc
40,Noah's Ark!,"Noah's Ark at the Skirball was a really great experience. We have two daughters age 5 and 7 and they had a great time playing and discovering and touching everything!!! And it is all allowed. The exhibit contains animals made from all kinds of recycled items. In the small room that you wait before you go in there are several birds suspended from the ceiling that are made from shoes, purses, mini-blinds, recurve bows, whisks, and old canes among other things. Their are lots of hands on things like a wind maker, a rain maker, moving the heads of giraffes, a puzzle that makes part of the hull of the ark, and then when you get inside of the ark kids can climb all over and put things down chutes, pull things up on ropes, and generally have a great time.NOTE: If you are able to make a reservation for a Thursday it is free!!! You only get about 2 hours to explore and play, but really that is enough time to have a bunch of fun",Dustin E
40,"""One of those places you need periodically to return to""","Well done, well documented, easy to visit, easy to explore, and close to the freeways and downtown LA.",amercorp
50,Something for everyone,"If you have a 2 yr. old and a 10 yr old, this museum will satisfy both. If you have a 2 yr. old, a 10 yr. old and grandparents, everyone will find something to enjoy. This museum is home to Noah's Ark - an incredible tactile and visual experience. The concept is to interpret Noah's Ark through art and imagination. Once you enter the exhibit, a docent gives a brief explanation of what you will see. After the entry, guests enter a large area filled with stuffed animals and various over-sized animals represented in various artistic mediums. There lots of manipulative exhibits, showing different prespectives of what you would find on a ship. A hallway filled with various Noah's Arks leads to the next large room. This area contains cooking centers, climbing options that lead to a rope walkway around the upper level of the room, and other interactive experiences. The final large area has puzzles, materials to build animal habitats for the animals and small tables and chairs. Tickets to this exhibit are timed for a 2 hour period and that is more than enough time to satisfactorialy enjoy this exhibit. Upstairs there is a gift shop with unusual age-appropriate gifts.But that is not all this museum has to offer. There are galleries with other cultural and artistic exhibits that will entice older patrons. There is a cafe with a thorough selections for quick meals and plenty of kid-friendly tables for relaxed dining. For something more extensive, there is a marvelous cafe that is also kid-friendly. Their food is high-caliber and fresh. They have good selections for children and if you have a food-throwing toddler, the floor can withstand that.This is a Los Angeles gem.",patio53
50,Interesting Jewish Historical and Cultural Museum,Wonderful museum with varying events and exhibits. Good concerts here during the summers outside on the back patio area. Nice place to spend a summer night.,alanmhersh

40,Very Comprehensive Jewish History Exhibits and great Cafe,"The food at the Cafe is excellent and affordable. The permanent Jewish history exhibits are very comprehensive and they even have part of an ancient Synagog floor and wall outside along with a very detailed explanation. There was also a temporary exhibit called ""Women hold up Half the Sky"" that was very informative. Parking is free and admission is on par for museums in Los Angeles.",AnastaciaM7
50,Really like this Center (more like a museum),"What a cultural exhibit that includes many special exhibits, film, gallery and the wonderful Noah's Ark play area (which is a must see with younger children). Tour the exhibits of Jewish heritage, which are beautifully presented. Sometimes they are included in the Bank of America show your card free Sundays. Zeidler's Cafe serves delicious food and we always try to eat there for lunch. Great Center, just bad traffic area if going doing rush hours.",B J
50,A visit to remember!,"What a treat! My family spend an afternoon touring the Skirball, enjoying not only the museum proper but also the Noah's Ark exhibit. All first class with something for everyone. Our grandson especially liked playing in Noah's Ark, with all of the cleverly done animals. And I enjoyed learning a little more about Jewish history while visiting the various exhibits. The restaurant (for lunch) was also excellent. I would recommend the Skirball to anyone visiting the Los Angeles.",Steve N
50,Unusual and educational cultural experience,We stumbled upon this spectacular cultural center while trying to find the Getty Museum. What a richly endowed center with exhibits that focus on presenting socially relevant issues and growing children's sociocultural awareness. Very new buildings with beautifully landscaped grounds. The restaurant has delicious entrees. Free parking and reasonable exhibit entry fee. Definitely visit!,arlenejoe
40,Two excellent current exhibitions on show until March 2012,"I went to the Skirball to see the excellent exhibition ""Women hold up half the sky"" which is on until 11 March 2012. This is an uplifting exhibition inspired by a book of the same name, which addresses gender inequality. There are stories of women who have changed their lives through education, economics, and self determination. As well as photographs, visual art and sound installations, there are interactive opportunities for you to get involved. The focus is not just on women in developing countries, but on women who live in the greater Los Angeles area also. If you go on a Thursday, entry is free.Whilst tat the Skirball look around the walls at the excellent ""Pearls of Wisdom"" exhibition. These are multimedia ""pearls"" created by survivors of domestic violence in response to their memories of pain, and is part of a community engagement project. This exhibition is free and is on until 26 February 2012. There is a cafe and gift shop.",TravelbugVietnam
50,Skirball - A Must See Museum and Great Event Venue in Los Angeles,"Skirball has an awesome core museum and they also have really interesting rotating exhibits like Houdini, Masters of Illusion and coming up Women Hold Up Half the Sky. They also have Noah's Ark which is a permanent hand’s on exhibit for kids but I guarantee adults will love it just as much. Skirball also hosts the most beautiful weddings, Mitzvah's corporate events and other life cycle celebrations. They serve great food in Zeidler's Cafe and the chef for private events is terrific. They have an Amphitheatre, auditorium, outside venue with a pond and gorgeous mountain backdrop, stunning ballroom and a new amazing ballroom on the way (2013) that will seat over 500 with a dance floor. Oh, I can't forget their free Thursday night summer concert series. They bring in musicians from all over the world and it is always an exciting line up. This is a must see in Los Angeles.",Elisa Kotin
30,Great venue for corporate reception,I hosted a conference at the Skirball LA and the attendees love it. It's a very different feel from your typical corporate meeting space.,Ask_Tiff
50,Interesting continuing exhibits with some very good special exhibits,Great variety with many things for a variety7 of tastes. AVOID the restaurant - salty & over-priced,ConcernedCalifornia
50,"Such fun, hands on museum, but with long lines","We went to the Noah's Ark exhibit which was beautiful and interesting. There was a terrific introduction by the guide. the children then took off for amazing hands on exploration of the inside of noah's ark. The animals are made out of many everyday materials and are so sturdy. they could make noise and thunder and lightning. they climbed all over the inside of the ark. it was difficult for adults to get up there if you had a child who was scared to go alone. but it was very safe and they could climb high. and then the guides introduced them to multiethnic dance which some kids loved and some did not. but it was terrific all in all. there was a lovely rainbow at the end if there is sunlight. there are some tables for eating as well as a nice cafe. I would definitely recommend making reservations as early as you can in the summer. the weekends and thursdays (which are free) are booked very early. even though we bought our tickets online, we still had to wait on the same slow moving line to buy as well as to get our stickers. it seems to me that could be streamlined a bit more. the admissions are timed, and good for 90minutes or so. they are forgiving of about 30minute delay and will tack it on the end.",gypsy41
40,Always Interesting,"I've been to the Skirball three times for three different exhibitions, and have always found the exhibitions to be very interesting and well-presented. While the Skirball is a Jewish-American Cultural Center, the exhibitions have a very broad, well-researched, and extremely accessible perspective. The three exhibitions I've seen - Bob Dylan, The Freedom Riders, and Harry Houdini were all well curated - with lots of information with available docent tours. The Skirball has easy access off I-405 north of LA, with plenty of ramp parking. Free admission on Thursdays.",mplsmarko
50,"Fascinating Museum , Houdini a Must See, and a Great Restaurant","My husband and I made our first trip to the Skirball Cultural Center today. We had no idea what to expect, but we knew it was about Jewish history. It is a remarkable and enlightening experience. The museum section of the complex is a presentation of the history, culture and of course, religion of the Jewish people. Each part of the exhibit is beautifully detailed with engaging descriptions of each display. There is an emphasis on the relationship between the Jewish culture and democracy. My husband bought a few books and is reading right now about Lincoln and the Jews. The special exhibit is about Houdini. I was expecting a small room with a few pictures. Wrong! It is a huge exhibit hall with multimedia presentations of the life and magic illusions of Houdini. It is laid out from the beginning of his story as a Jewish immigrant, through his increasingly difficult ""magic"". The artifacts such as the straight jacket from which he escaped, the milk can in which he was locked, and many more are remarkable. There are original posters and current art works about Houdini. This is a must see, even if you are not a fan of Houdini. The connection of Houdini to the American culture demonstrates his place in history between the Civil War and the modern age. Please see Houdini before September 4, 2011 when this exhibit moves to San Francisco. We ate lunch at Zeidlers Cafe on the premises. It was an excellent lunch, especially for vegetarians and pescatarians. There were many selections for us. The service was outstanding. It is a nice addition to a visit to the Skirball.",BolsaChicaMoonDancer
50,Two by Two,"This review is on the Noah's Ark @ the Skirball.It is FREE every Thursday, but you have to get reservations online. They usually distribute fast. Always look on the first day of the month for 2 months later. Parking is FREE.I loved it and so did my 2 year old. It wasn't crowded at all cause you have time limits as to when you can go in and when you have to leave by (2 hours)The introduction was great and really gets you into the scene and viewing (all of the animals are made out recycled items).Everything the children can touch. My son loved the zebras, making rain and lightning, putting the animals on the tram and watching them go up into the boat, playing in the net (if under 4 you have to go in with them), and the rainbow mist outside.They have a craft table for older kids.Definitely recommend this place for anytime",socalpcktmemories
40,Noah's Ark exhibit was very good,"I went here with my 2 girls (3 & 6) and other adults that did not have kids. It was a very nice exhibit. The gardens were fantastic- I wish I'd had more time to check them out. We were under a bit of a time crunch so we only viewed the Noah's Ark exhibit. My children really enjoyed. It was very unique. I liked how a live person did the introduction to the exhibit. They set the mood and the tone for what was to come. It was a very creative, interactive exhibit using lots of found objects to create all the animals. Many things moved or could be moved. There were lots of things to touch and work.I think the adults with-out kids had fun as well. I'm not so sure if a 8-10 year old would love it but my kids enjoyed their time. After we viewed the exhibit we spent some time in the art studio outside the exhibit. My girls LOVED that making neat crafts to take home. If we'd had more time we would have checked out more of the center. It had a lot to offer. The staff was very friendly had helpful. Worth checking out if you have smaller children.",SpotTVMom
40,Informative,"What a nice celebration it is at the skirball about the Jewish! It was definitely an education. Reserve at least 2 hours. Very close to the Getty Center, can visit both on the same day and still won't be too rushed. However, if you were to consider researching on the Jewish culture or is considering visiting the Museum of Tolerance also about 15 mins from here if there's no traffic), I recommend visiting the Museum of Tolerance first, then the Skirball, simply because one just values and understands so much more when you first learn what the Jewish went through, then move on to the celebration of their culture and religion.",ariesgal
