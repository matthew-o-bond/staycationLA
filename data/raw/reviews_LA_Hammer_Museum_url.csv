50,"A bit of a ride, but worth it","We decided to see the Hammer Museum and went on Primary Election Day. It was a long bus ride out Wilshire Blvd from the convention center (used the #20 bus) to the UCLA campus. We found entrance free. We checked in and were then able to visit both the permanent collection and the Paul McCarthy exhibition. The lobby gallery showed some recent works and we enjoyed these immensely. We then went upstairs to the permanent collections, which afforded us the opportunity to see the Wonderfull collections and works by some of our favorite artists, we never saw before, and several of which were not obvious in our recognition. We then went to see the rather crude, avant guarde, drawings of McCarthy (not McCartney). The drawings were strikingly sexual and angry in tone and implementation. Most definitely explicit and not for the timid or prudish. Some younger visitors might be upset. All in all worth the trip and visit. The voting at the museum actually added to the spectacle, and the length of the line the youthful age of the voters looked like a wonderful awakening of civic duty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephA491
50,Outstanding,"The hammer Museum that is now part of UCLA is free and at the edge of their campus. The building is modern, and the galleries open into a 2 story courtyard. The Hammer collection is traditional with Van Gogh and several Impressionists. Admission is free; validated parking is available on ground level, and they have a large gift shop. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
40,Well Worth the Visit!,"The Hammer Museum is located in Westwood Village in Wilshire Boulevard. Next to UCLA and convenient to Beverly Hills.Admission is free.It is a fairly small museum. Unfortunately, when we visited, several of the galleries were closed as new displays were being established.The main gallery was open. It displays the personal collection of Armand Hammer. There were about forty works, all of outstanding quality, with Van Goghs and a number of impressionists. The day we visited was very quiet, so we were able to enjoy the works at our leisure. There were several other interesting exhibits but this was definitely the highlight.The building itself was worth the visit, open and spacious with a large open central plaza. Incongruously was an area with two table tennis tables! When we visited there were spirited games underway.Another outstanding feature was Audrey at the Hammer a very good indoor/outdoor restaurant.Parking is available underground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913alg

50,A must visit museum in LA,"The Hammer is a great museum to see both modern and classic art. The larger galleries had modern artists exhibited and there was a smaller exhibit of the classic artist such as Monet, Van Gogh, and Rembrandt. Admission is free and the parking garage only costs $7. But bring cash because you can not pay for parking by card. This museum is also extremely family-friendly. There is a beautiful outdoor cafe if you want to stop for coffee or lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst
50,Great Free Museum in heart of Westwood,"I‚Äôve been here twice in the last 6 months. First visit was an unscheduled afternoon visit w/my hubby just to check out the museum. My 2nd visit was SPECTACULAR!! They had a lecture series on a specific artist - a personal favorite - and learned a ton from the museum historian John Walsh. The details and background on the art / artist were so informative, I learned a ton more about an artist I‚Äôve studied for years. It was an excellent experience üëç. Parking is convenient/ under the museum and it‚Äôs pretty reasonable ($7 flat rate on weekends). Check the website for any lectures before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OGTracyW
40,We enjoyed the visit. Free admission too!,We went to the Hammer Museum on November 2 and have to say it was very good. We had an enjoyable visit and really liked the Max Hooper Schneider piece currently on display to be very mesmerizing and entertaining. The room sized piece was comprised of disposed items which were repurposed and were arranged in a very thought-provoking way. We walked around this piece 3 times and still found different objects that we missed on the previous lap. Very cool!Lari Pittman‚Äôs work was also on display for a majority of the upper floor and was good but was off color for the most part. We enjoyed the museum and would visit again. Admission is free here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs
30,Hit or miss,"The 'hit': the museum has had interesting, provocative exhibits. The permanent collection contains some treasures worth seeing. The building surrounds a courtyard where seating is available.The 'miss': more often than not, the contemporary art installation galleries are closed. As the museum is currently undergoing a massive remodeling it is not a place to be right now.Its recently opened restaurant is overpriced and an uninviting space.The bookstore/gift shop seems to specialize in being odd. The non-book items have prices that are over the top as well as pretentious in their weirdness.Skip it and go to the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. Outstanding works of art and opened on a regular basis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbug880
40,Construction is A Challenge But Still Worth a Visit!,"The Hammer Museum is under construction so getting around is challenging. The permanent collection is in a single gallery somewhere on one of the top floors. It is a maze to get there. During my visit there was an interesting, though I'm sure extremely provocative show of works by Sarah Lucas. That show just ended. I personally thought it was quite fascinating and was impressed by her use of many mediums! However, I am sure many people were disturbed by the show. Anyway, the permanent collection is always a pleasure, though the star Rembrandt portrait of a child is not currently hanging. Still worth a visit and yes, the price is right...FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hermuslj
40,Hammer time.,"The museum has a small permanent collection of European paintings. The other galleries have modern art. The building is undergoing some type of remodel to its facade, though it's covered making it hard to see. All the open galleries are accessible through the central court yard. You can spend 2 hours here and see it all. Museum free, parking $7.00 for 3 hours validate at the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7128HBscottf
50,Small Museum in Westwood To Check Out,"Often overlooked when thinking about LA museums, the Hammer is a sweet spot to spend a few hours. The galleries are positioned around an open air courtyard that houses Audrey, a fairly new restaurant. On Thursday nights in July they host free music in conjunction with KCRW and the galleries stay open until 9pm - definitely a fun thing to do.The exhibits are interesting, although the current one was bizarre, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilltarinw

The museum has a good bookstore and service oriented staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
50,Fine Art and Culture...for FREE!,"The Hammer Museum is a three-story building with varying exhibitions on each level, a gift shop, and a restaurant.

30,Get your timing right,"I know it‚Äôs true that only a small amount of any collection is displayed at any one time. But I was so disappointed with my visit today. They are switching exhibits (odd thing to do over a holiday weekend) so only one gallery open with one additional very small exhibit which was definitely not my taste. The gallery that was open was pretty much a ‚Äúone piece‚Äù collection ticking off some old art world notables. There didn‚Äôt seem to be any theme, I know nothing about the collector now that I didn‚Äôt know yesterday, it‚Äôs as if the curator said, ‚Äúok, dip into the collation and throw up enough big names on the wall to be credible‚Äù.I wanted to really like this place and maybe one day I will, but today, it was a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2504

It is really fun!Went recently and saw Ink stain images by Victor Hugo. Had no idea he was a visual artist as well as a writer. Made in LA is a sublime show, see it and you'll understand us Los Angelenos better. Some of Hammer's personal collection is on display. There is a Rembrandt there - the image is so strong it feels like the man is in the room with you. The museum is Free of Charge so take the kids. Parking downstairs is moderate, but with some jockeying you can also get a meter and park for much less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeni2003
40,The highlight was the short film event hosted by the Sklar Bros.,"Intimate museum with a manageable (mostly rotating/temporary) collection and a nice new restaurant.

Not free, but worth a look and a taste- the restaurant and the Hammer Store. This museum is worth a second and a third look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillV195
40,Unique museum with more than art,In addition to the various exhibits that are always interesting this museum has regular documentaries that are of interest. Weekly free mindfulness on Thursdays is also available. No charge for entrance and minimal parking fees makes this museum a nice place to getaway without much effort. I am looking forward to new restaurant opening in Feb.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/repeatvisitor_BD
30,I liked the permeant collection. Some of the modern art was ???,"Hammer museum is a good museum to visit, free admission, reduced parking and depending on the exhibition an interesting display. The permanant exhibition has some Vah Gogh's, Rembrant's and several fresh impressionists. I didn't get the modern art displays that were featured. Most of it was strange. I will go back to see other traveling exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
30,"Love the Impressionist collection, modern galleries not so much","I have been wanting to see the Hammer Museum for some time. It is located in Westwood Village and if you are local you can take the 234 bus right to the front door, almost. I loved the French Impressionist painting in regular collection. The Rembrandts, Van Gogh, Monet and Matisse are amazing. The modern art galleries are a little to obtuse, but if that is your thing, you might enjoy your visit. For modern art visit the Broad downtown for an amazing experience. I thought the docents were a little green. Most of the docents couldn't answer questions, they are there to keep you an arms length from the rare paintings. Admission is FREE so the price is positive. On the do not miss list are the Rembrandts and 19th Century French Impressionists. Plus in the patio area are the most fascinating chairs which look like large spinning tops. Sit in one and it swivels around without tipping over. No age limit-once you see someone joyfully sitting in one you will join in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel92630
10,Waste of time - should be closed during install period,Top tip - call ahead to make sure all exhibitions open. We drove out of the way and paid for parking only to find that all but 2 rooms were closed for new installation.The web site did not mention the closures. Unlike the Annenberg Space which clearly across the web site banner advised of closure for same reason.The 2 rooms open were really sad. Some cloth insects and some resin containers. Really? Kids laughed at me for 2 hours that I had dragged them to spend 5 minutes looking at kindergarten art show!!Only upside ... it was free entry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
10,Agree With Recent Comment - Close until Exhibits are Ready,"Ordinarily a visit to the Hammer Museum is mind-broadening and interesting. One can always expect to enjoy new and different ways of experiencing art at the Hammer. However, when this reviewer visited on September 19, 2018 there was only one room open and this, the size of a large RV contained about seven large fabric insect like cloth affairs and some strobe lighting. Interesting, but hardly the reason to even make a stop. Be sure to check what and when the exhibits will be shown before making a trek. This reviewer was told that normality would return on October 6, 2018. Check!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnH881
20,Props from Night Gallery tv show,Ultra modern art. If this is your thing then you will like it. There were a lot of people who seemed to enjoy the various presentations. Not too sure why three rows of various cereals in metal containers or a giant cigarette smoking a cigarette would draw such positive response but to each his own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auggiemctavish
40,Surprised!,"I was hoping to see a better distribution of space. Some of the rooms like the Leonard Nimoy had a private event going on and space seemed to be limited. Maybe the overdose on installations by the Made in LA exhibits, which I am not fond of, made the areas look reduced. I liked the open areas and the small bridge on the third floor. Also the shop had an interesting array of art products and offerings. I‚Äôll make sure to go again when the exhibits change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KriticL
50,"During the biennial exhibition, Made in L.A. 2018","It‚Äôs a little pity that I can‚Äôt see the special exhibition during this period. However, the works displayed are wonderful and inspirational. Many pieces reflect the important social issues that we are facing. I believer that they may make the viewers have some deep thinkings. By the way, I love the design of building that has some interactive facilities that we can play with them. That‚Äôs fun and worthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnhsu0910
50,Diedrich Brackens tapestries were very moving and worth the visit.,"I visit the Hammer regularly when I'm in LA and usually find an exhibition that I enjoy. My recent visit was during the first week of the Made In L.A. 2018 exhibition. I found the Diedrich Bracken tapestries to be very moving and worth the visit. I also enjoyed the artwork by Naotaka Hiro and the exhibition in The Vault by E.J. Hill. I enjoy the manageable size of this museum and the ability to see some great art exhibitions. With UCLA's purchase of the building and planned expansion, this is a museum that will be watched in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2025IHmichaelo
10,should have closed til construction is over...,right now the museum has very little on display. one small room was open. it was an odd topic and a tiny space. not worth the drive/walk at all. they should have closed til whatever is going on (construction or ??) is completed. the gift shop was also open but meaningless without the rest of the museum. very disappointed ... as we had read all the rave reviews.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tucsonfolks
10,No Old Masters until September,Walked a mile to visit this museum but nothing on display except a couple of so so installations. Place seems nice but basically No Art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadisonGrog
50,"Impressive Art, Manageable Space!","Not to sound old, but one of my favorite things about the Hammer Museum is that you get to see a world class permanent collection and unique contemporary exhibits yet don't have to be exhausted from huge crowds and never ending hallways. That doesn't mean this museum is limited, on the contrary, I was super impressed with the amount of variety this place has to offer. Any time I get to see a Rembrandt in North America I have to smile. Their gift shop has some awesome post cards as well! I highly recommend this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arissalovesart

50,Don‚Äôt miss ‚ÄúStories of Almost Everyone‚Äù,"We came here primarily to see whatever part of the permanent collection is currently on display, and found that only one room was occupied by a selection of very interesting works, including two fine Rembrandts and three Vincent van Goghs from different periods of his short career. More interesting, however, was the eclectic show ‚ÄúStories of Almost everyone,‚Äù in which objects were presented as subjects with their own very interesting stories. One notable exception was a presentation of performance art conceived by Tino Seghal, in which the subject/object relationship became seriously complicated. The dancer who performed the piece when we were there was breathtakingly effective. See the entire show, and don‚Äôt miss Seghal‚Äôs ‚ÄúSelling Out.‚Äù Admission to the Hammer is gratis, so the price can‚Äôt be beat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operalover939
30,Split Personality,"What a strange experience. In one gallery Hammer's personal collection, including Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Moreau, you get the idea. Choice works well displayed, In 5 other galleries, contemporary art installations that are in a very different mindset.

50,Amazing Wow Wow.,"This was a museum we came across by chance, whilst exploring theWestwood district..It is part of the nearby museum and has temporary exhibitions. The exhibition of Stories of Almost Everyone is worth visiting. There are artefacts, which represents well guarded and the artists interpretation is recorded on the wall. I found the shoe and telegraph pole quite compelling.The Lawrence Abu Hamadan exhibition has been drawn of the prison in Syria, when he was restricted to his cell. The lines have been drawn from the sounds that he could hear. Very clever.There is an excellent shop on he top floor and a permanent small private collection of various artists such as Van Gogh, Gaugin ,Degas and Monet. He has favoured the 19th CenturyFrench artists.Downstairs is a very pleasant courtyard, where rinks are available and where you can have fun on some swivel chairs. Entry is free and staff are friendly and helpful. It is a gem worth visiting, if interested in modern art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieQ937
40,Gem in Westwood,"When we visited in early January, only Armand Hammer's collection was open, but it was still well worth the visit. (And admission is free.)

It obviously has an agenda and that agenda made me feel very uncomfortable and unwanted.There is much I could say, all bad, so lets just skip it and leave it at this.Unless you are on a quest, as my wife is, to see every Van Gogh on public display in the world, just skip this place.

Unfortunately, during my visit most of the galleries were in transition to new shows and were closed. The permanent collection is very small, though fairly strong. It shouldn't take more than about an hour to see the entire collection, even at a leisurely pace.The museum is part of the UCLA campus and is in a fairly urban part of LA.

A great array of pictures - Is there any gallery in LA that does not have multiple masters?? Whilst the Hammer is small in comparison with other museums/galleries in LA, the Hammer MUST be on your go to list. Featured artists when I visited were Jeanine Oleson (performing Arts - interesting), Marisa Merz (thought provoking) and Oliver Payne & Keiichi Tanaami (probably not everyone's cup of tea but to me this was the best).

Ample parking is available in its garage or on the street. Admission is free. One can see the entire exhibit in an hour.Many of its exhibits and artists are in collaboration with UCLA.

40,Small University Museum,"The Hammer Museum is housed on the first floors of a skyscraper on the edge of the UCLA campus. Admission is free and they validate parking which is $6 for the first three hours, all the time you will need to see the museum. There's a nice atrium cafe serving beer, wine, and good food at reasonable prices. We enjoyed the contemporary art exhibits and the small permanent collection of older paintings.

Always interesting offering, well-curated public programs that includes lectures, readings, conversations, screening, music, and meditation. Wonderful book shop with great selection of books and gif items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyfulsteps
50,An Art-filled Respite,"The Hammer is a Los Angeles lodestone to be packed in every family's' trip bag. The ever changing featured artists and exhibits are always expertly researched, comprehensively collected, and intelligently explained to viewers which make it an attractive destination for a family introducing younger members to art culture. The museum's smaller size fits shorter attention spans so small bites for those acquiring a taste for art can be enjoyed without the overstuffed feeling of day at the LAMA, Broad, or Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoYork
50,"art, screening, music, meditation for burgain price: free","Hammer opens it's doors for free and it offers rich presentations, wonderful performances ( sometimes accompanies by complimentary food afterwards, food that compliments performance, either from the same region, or somehow connected to composition). There are intellectual discussions on cultural, political and social issue. Plus great collection of contemporary and classical art. There are art lectures at lunch time on Wed and meditation on Thu. The restaurant has good selection of healthy dishes and wine. Make sure you sit and spin in the Heatherwick chair, that was produced by squeezing it out of the tube, like toothpaste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tani101

50,"Great museum, worth a visit for sure!","I had a lovely time at this museum! The show on view at the time, Black Mountain College, was spectacular.

Definitely stop by if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katrynajc

10,Horrible Awful Not Worth Price of Admission (which is free),"Armand Hammer was a collector of beautiful art (16th - 20th century) which are supposed to be on display year round with other exhibits rotating, but there was only 1 room displaying these works. We only saw them after suffering through 2 floors of art (in the eye of the beholder). When we finally got to this room I was excited to see them. The next room was supposed to contain more, but it was Still Life with Fishes. We looked all around to find the exhibit. We'd walked right by the 1 tiny picture of fish. What?? Around the next corner my vision was assaulted. I may catch flack for this but I don't care. I rounded the corner to see pictures of child p*rn. Large, framed photos hanging on the wall! I don't care who you are or how open minded you are, but that's wrong!! I won't describe them as it's taken me weeks to write this review without seeing the images. I tried to look away, and to my shock in the case under me are p*rnographic Polaroids of adults engaged in full acts. I went to see art not p*rn. No, I don't consider that ""art"". There was a school field trip while we were there and as a parent I was mortified. The staff was rude except the lady at the entrance. The outdoor seating is decent. Bathrooms were clean with warm water. Will NEVER be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belleprogrammer
20,Worth stopping in only if you're in the area or there is a special exhibit,"The Hammer Museum is a small and modern space. While I like the outdoor patio and chairs, the current exhibits are not very interesting. It's enjoyable because the museum is free, and in the heart of Westwood on Wilshire Blvd, so it's nice to just pass through and maybe grab a coffee. I would not go hoping to see a multitude of beautiful or thought provoking pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrstne
50,For Contemporary Art - the Best!,"We thoroughly enjoyed the contemporary art on display at the Hammer Museum. From the delightful ""whirligig"" chairs in the courtyard to the fantastical murals in the entrance, the visit was both delightful and challenging (especially for those persons who aren't sure modern art is their first choice).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msirani
50,"Nice, helpful, great getaway...","Only a few blocks from the 405. Park underneath for $3, the museum is free, just check-in. Take elevator to 3rd floor, walk exhibits, then down to 2nd floor. This floor has a cafe and a few more exhibits. Then to the first for entry exhibit, then you're done. It's small but nice. We met friends for lunch, food was good, took awhile to get it after ordering, but we were in no hurry. The exhibits are inside, but there is a courtyard outside, so you might need a jacket if it's chilly. The cafe does take reservations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffBransford
50,Please Take the Time to Visit the Museum,"We happened to be in the Wilshire District and on an impulse we went to the Hammer Museum. It is amazing that one person accumulated such fantastic art and is willing to share it with the public. Parking in the area is extremely bad, but for $3.00 you can park underground at the Museum. Admission is free. You will see a diversity of art, but the most stunning are the masters. Do not miss the opportunity to see this fine art museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjhaardvark
50,Great museum to include in LA travels,"The Hammer Museum was a pleasant surprise. It doesn't get the hype it deserves. If you can, include it in your museum travels while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrappe
40,Spend some Hammer time if you are in the area,"If you are in the area and enjoy visiting smaller art museums then I suggest you pop into the Hammer. They have contemporary art exhibitions as well as a small collection of European and US paintings. I loved the wall art exhibition by Kenny Scharf and The Armand Collection (Renaissance Europe to early US twentieth century - Van Gogh, Cezanne, Degas, Pissarro, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec etc) I was staying at a hotel about 10 minutes walk away from the Hammer Museum, so it was easy for me to visit. You probably only need 1 hour to view the collections / exhibitions, however there is a lovely inner courtyard and cafe at the museum to sit and soak up the museum ambience. Admission to the museum is free.Visited February 2016.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796alisonp
40,Small but Worth It,A great collection of fine art and very diverse. Certainly worth a trip. But be sure to visit Westwood Memorial Park across the street located between the skyscrapers to see the graves of famous celebrities including Marilyn Monroe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moongirl
40,Free museum worth an hour,"If you really hate contemporary art, don't expect to enjoy the Hammer. But if you're open-minded, this free museum is worth a visit.I liked passing through the courtyard and outside walkways between exhibits (made my attention last a little bit longer) and shop had lots of interesting things to buy. I could see grabbing a coffee and just hanging out in the courtyard or balcony to enjoy the unusual seating areas set up, and just hang out with a friend.As for the exhibitions, I didn't love them, but felt like my time was well-spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenny_in_Palo_Alto
40,Excellent small private museum with free admissiln,"I visit one of my my alma maters (UCLA) once in a while and make it a point to stop in at the Hammer Museum which was just being conceived when I was a student at UCLA and its main benefactor was still alive. I recall the LA Times writing about the disappointment of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art at the loss of the Hammer collection, which 8it had on loan. The Hammer Museum is located at the corner of Westwood Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard, close to the 405 freeway exit. We easily found metered street parking. It is easily visited without need for advance tickets, reservations, etc unlike other area museums (Getty Villa).The permanent Hammer collection is nowhere as extensive as the Getty's, which is much older and has grown tremendously through the years. When we visited in late December, the Hammer had Canadian landscape painter Lawren Harris, Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Frances Stark and Kenny Scharf. As with all contemporary art, one needs to keep an open mind and accept that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I have read some comments about the special exhibitions of the Hammer museum as being social commentary, not qualifying as art... but the same may be said of art at the Centre Pompidou.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGN777
30,Didn't quite enjoy it,The museum is nice and conveniently located. However some of the art exhibits were kind of weird and so I didn't really appreciate it that much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ss-hao
20,"A lot of social comment, but not art","Armand Hammer was a collector of beautiful art, but there were only two rooms displaying the works he had collected. Much of the museum's offerings were, in my opinion, not fine art, but works by angry young men and women, making social comments. If I want to read that, I will take out my computer. In the future I will go to the Minneapolis Museum of art or the Boston Museum of art. Both of which are far superior to anything we have in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanac369
30,So-So,"I went specifically to see the Hammer Collection-and was very disappointed to find only two small rooms. The holdings in these two rooms were great, it would have been nice to see more. The entire rest of the museum was modern exhibits, some good, some over rated. The museum is free, so I'd go if in the vicinity, but would not make a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marftrip

50,Lawren Harris exhibition at the Hammer,"If you want to better understand your neighbor to the north, visit the Lawren Harris exhibition at the Hammer Museum near UCLA. Lawren Harris is an artist considered to be an national treasure in Canada, but his work is mostly unknown in the US. Steve Martin, who saw Lawren's work while visiting Canada, was instrumental in bringing this magnificent group of paintings to the Hammer. Don't wait too long because the exhibit is in LA only until January 24th. It's free to go to the museum and parking is easy and validated. While there, we had a great lunch in the cafe. It certainly wasn't free like the museum but the food was interesting and delicious and the service was good. If you bring kids, there are gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches with very nice fries--our kids decided to leave off the kale that is included in the sandwiches!! I got their kale as a side dish and it was delicious too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethhL8068MZ
50,Open For All and Free For Good,"The Hammer is easy to miss - I've lived a stone's throw from Westwood for most of my life and only recently discovered this hidden gem. What I love: the permanent collection houses wonderful Impressionist and Dutch Masters paintings, and there are great rotating exhibitions. I recently viewed Njideka Akunyili Crosby's work and was moved by her subject matter. The docents (UCLA students) are knowledgeable and elicit thoughtful inquiry and discussion about the artwork. There's a beautiful outdoor cafe, and don't miss the cool chairs that spin like a top! Best of all, this place is free. Parking is $3 for the first three hours with validation at the Welcome Desk, and $1.50 for each additional 15 minutes; cash only. There are also free 2 hour lots close by in Westwood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelgirl90049
50,Fabulous Museum,"For contemporary art lovers this is the place. The galleries are bright and large, the furniture and all the display elements are the best of contemporary crafts. Don't miss spinning around on the rotating chairs on the second floor. You won't fall over, and it's a trip! Just don't eat at the cafe- it's overpriced and not good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazzyfille

50,Fantastic small museum,As a regular museum attendee the Hammer is a welcoming and free museum with a wonderful permanent exhibition area and also features some at times incredible temporary exhibitions. That they are also friendly and located in Westwood (800 degrees is right across the street!) is a real bonus. And did I mention they have a ping pong table for all to use? Not sure why but what a great break for my family while visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
40,Great FREE museum in Westwood,"I love coming to the Hammer. It‚Äôs close to me, now free, thanks to a donation from Erica Glaser Foundation, and different. Some of the art I like, some I don‚Äôt, but the exhibits change often, and are usually interesting. Great design which incorporated the outdoors with central courtyard. LOVE the spinning chairs there. Good giftshop, often with nice sale books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherrys266
50,One of the Best Kept Secret FREE things in L.A.,"In may we had reason to visit the UCLA campus, and an afternoon stroll down the hill took us to the Hammer Museum. The hammer has permanent exhibits of European masters, temporary exhibits, and several small theaters with continuously-running art films. There is a larger theater as well for major film viewings.There is a cafe and a museum store as well, with pricing you would expect at a world-class museum.Take a couple of hours and visit. Take a bit longer, and enjoy the film presentations. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnwK6422MX
50,"This world. Lass museum offers free admission, amazing!","I still cannot believe that admission is FREE! Unfortunately the Hammer can be overlooked due to the relatively close proximity of LACMA, MOCA, The Gettyet al. This is gem of a museum that art lovers should not miss. Though smaller than the fore mentioned, The Hammer is equal in calibre, offering a combination of world class traveling exhibitions, a variety of exhibit related programmes and events, as well as and a permanent collection. Parking is conveniently located in the building's own structure, (just below the museum) only $3 for the first three hours! And did I mention that admission is FREE? If you love art or are even vaguely interested, you would be a fool to not visit The Hammer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChromeCorgi
50,What art should be about.,"A smaller gallery with viewing on three floors. As literature states - The Hammer is free for good, issuing a declaration of a destination full of thought and double entendre. There is always something of wonder and intelligence at The Hammer, finding you leaving a better person - now that simply what art must be, should be about. Visit Hammer's personal collection - a snapshot of collecting in Edwardian and Victorian times, particularly French Masters and find yourself alone with Renoir. The gift store is world class, the courtyard cafe a destination in and of itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salbal2255
50,Great free museum,"Could not ask for more from a free museum. Had examples of all the greats (Monet, Rembrandt ect.) As well as many modern artists. Only wish I had more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobaccocay
50,Warm and inviting!,"The Hammer is not a HUGE museum but they make up by having a great selection of contemporary artists on display. I really enjoyed the ""Perfect Likeness"" exhibition, featuring works by Jeff Wall and other renowned artists.The staff was helpful and sweet when sharing information. Overall great visit! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221cristinau
30,If this museum wasn't free I wouldn't go there,"Okay, the architecture of the museum is very interesting, and they have some wonderful pieces of art there, but on the whole, it's just not a very good museum of art.I visited a photographic exhibit there today. What I've found typical of the museum, on my 2nd visit (Went to see this particular photo exhibit), is that while some of the art is extraordinary, some isn't worthy of display in a museum because it just isn't very good. More troubling about this museum are the thumbnail details about each piece beside them. Often, especially when describing a third rate piece, I imagine to justify their poor choice for including it, the pretentiousness of the description defies all sensibility. Moreover, often the expert who writes some of them misses the point entirely anyway. It's a shame.I just can't recommend the museum at this point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NSL14
40,"Small but beautiful, and free makes it worth a visit","I was staying near The Hammer and walked down there to give it look. There is paid parking under the museum on the Glendon Ave. side. There are also entrances on the Wilshire Blvd and Lindbrook Ave sides. I suggest going immediately to the third floor. During my visit in July 2015 there was terrific photography exhibit. The permanent gallery has a collection of very famous European painters from the 17th to 19th century. It is sort of an extension of the collection at the Getty Center. The Hammer, however, also devotes space to modern art including film. There are a few small theaters with continuously running films. There is also a large theater but nothing was playing during my weekday morning visit. The cafe looks very inviting and may be worth a peaceful visit.It didn't take me long to see most of the main exhibits. The Hammer Store is very nice and had an interesting collection of the usual art books but also jewelry and ordinary items of artistic style.If you have some time and are interested in art you should make a point to visit The Hammer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brent-RN

50,Beautiful Building - Amazing Cafe!,This is a wonderful museum with some lovely exhibits! The Mark Bradford exhibit is pretty wonderful right now (June 2015). The thing I will most remember was our outstanding lunch at the Hammer's cafe...just thinking about it now makes my mouth water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Catjoe
40,"Small but excellent permanent collection, exhibitions of varying quality","This museum right on Wilshire just a little east of the 405 on the south edge of Westwood has some jewels in its small permanent collection and features some interesting exhibitions. When I visited they had a fascinating retrospective on the work of the groundbreaking Heatherwick Stucio, but they also had a couple of less impressive shows as well. Still, a very pleasant place to spend an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemh333
50,"Nice museum close to campus, with a great store","Hammer is a nicely organized and different museum. The staff are very friendly. The atmosphere is nice and lovely. Lots of natural light everywhere. I asked the information desk if they have some place for young kids (i have a toddler). She said not specifically, but my daughter enjoyed the yard area. She also liked the bookstore in the second floor. They had nice books and toys. We ended up buying some toys for her and some gifts for a friend we were about to visit in LA.I visited the Getty Center too. I personally think Hammer is much more fun when you'd rather to be close to campus and just walk around.We enjoyed our visit in Hammer. Keep up the nice work there :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nabel2013
40,A great experience all around.,"Great space, the family really enjoyed the interactive stuff outside. The permanent collection is surprisingly good for a small museum. There was a great temporary exhibit on an English design studio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
50,A real gem,A room of wonderful impressionist art including some of the greatest Van Goghs and a room if old masters with a fabulous Titan and an exquisite Rembrandt. Then some modern gallery's. Near by an artful coffee house for you to find. Great treasure hunting all in all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidWashingtonDC
40,Hammer Museums,I love the internal space -- open and roofless. The more conventional art collection is small but choice and full of cool stuff -- I really liked the Moreau paintings. The more modern art was intriguing and cooler than I thought it would be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongo2015
50,Arm and Hammer your way here.,"The last couple of reviews said it all in an excellent way and we agree completely. If you're visiting before it closes in May, absolutely see the Heatherwick Studio exhibit. This isn't art in the usual sense, but rather a bunch of brilliant designs for useful things, like new buses for the London Transit system, a drawbridge that opens by curling up, another that's flat but can rise in the middle to let boats pass while staying open and functional the whole time, zipper bags, bowls and furniture that can be expanded and pushed back together, etc.There are lots of eateries within a block or two; I don't think I'd bother with the one in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie
50,Great exhibits,"Great shows and FREE admission. The store has a great selection of books and there are a line of very unique gift items called ""KIOSK"" I would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magnificentnile
40,The contemporary art worked for me this time,"I will always be one to keep my fingers crossed when I visit a museum of contemporary art. Some works make me roll my eyes, yet others are so clever I can‚Äôt get over it. Bottom line, I appreciate creativity so I‚Äôll seek that out and see what I think. My most recent visit to the Hammer Museum turned out to be a ‚Äúthumbs-up‚Äù experience. I spent a little over an hour and saw pretty much everything.The space is pretty cool: eight galleries (one for videos) on three levels, with courtyards on the main level (footbridge overhead). The ‚ÄúArmand Hammer Collection‚Äù features a two-room display of masterwork painting from some well-known artists such as Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Daumier, Moreau, Boudin and Corot. Very good.The other galleries have rotating exhibits of contemporary artwork and design in a variety of media. The Heatherwick Studio architecture (thru May 2015) rates an A+ and attracted by far the most people while I was there. You could tell everyone in the room was amazed, and I made two full laps around the gallery. I could write a whole review just on that one exhibit (included a park bench from extruded aluminum, c'mon!). The ‚ÄúGridwork,‚Äù ‚ÄúFrottage and Rubbings‚Äù and Pedro Reyes exhibits were not as mind-blowing, but I‚Äôm glad I stopped in to experience these art styles that I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Two other galleries had stuff that was in the ‚Äúroll your eyes‚Äù category for me; no need to elaborate.The courtyard has some rotation-molded ‚Äúspun chairs‚Äù which roll around sort of like a top that has dropped to its side. Everyone who sat in these chairs (myself included) seemed to be having a blast. You can buy one for yourself ($700+) in the museum store.Hope these notes help:* The museum is free.* The parking garage is off of Westwood Boulevard. On the Saturday I was there, it was a flat $3.00 with no time limit. Not sure what the rate is during the week. If the garage is full, there are other places within a couple blocks to park. Check the museum website for guidance.* ‚ÄúAmmo‚Äù caf√© is next to the north courtyard. I didn‚Äôt eat there, but I checked the lunch menu: mostly salads and sandwiches, from $10-$20.* ""Table tennis, anyone?"" There‚Äôs a ping-pong table on the upper level; this adds to the overall fun vibe of the property.* The Billy Wilder Theater shows classic movies starting in mid-afternoon. You can get a schedule at the info desk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
50,A gem of a museum with no cover charge!,"It's not often you can combine the worlds great museum and ""free"" but Hammer is an overlooked jewel. The museum is small enough that you can add it to any itinerary and yet not that small that you can't find something to see inside.Hammer had an amazing personal collection, so you can get a great ""survey"" of classic art but also the museum works hard to make their exhibits as good as any other museum!A special mention to the cafe which has a small but amazing menu. Great coffee and fresh made posts of tea. The soup of the day was a vegan squash that was clearly hearty and tasty. AND don't miss the gift shop. Great selection-including jewelry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josef_travels
40,Sanctuary and Beauty,"There are several pieces (Van Gogh, Monet, Stevens' Sarah Bernhardt, Gustave Moureau) that are well worth a trip to this FREE museum, but the temporary exhibitions will have you returning again and again. The current Francis Upritchard exhibit is gripping, both beautiful and terrible, but certainly creative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontereyFoodie
50,What a GEM!,"We recently visited the Hammer Museum at the suggestion of a friend, an art advisor, who has relocated to LA. What a good idea this was! We are both art aficionados and visit museums everywhere we travel. Not sure why Hammer was not on our radar, but now it will be. The vibe here is contemporary, but extremely well curated. There are many knowledgeable staff around, must be students, and they make this museum extra-vibrant. It has been a long time since we visited a museum where all of our questions were well-answered, and we learned even more by just chatting with the staff. The exhibition staging is well thought-out and interesting, there is something interesting to see in every direction. It's hard to take somewhat quirky contemporary art, and make it truly inviting. If you can go soon and see the Jim Hodges show, do it...it is wonderful. And if not, then revel in whatever shows are at Hammer, you will not be disappointed. And one more thing...it's free...thank you Mr. Hammer for this amazing gift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyCalifornia
40,Nice museum and cafe,"Once you've seen the Getty and LACMA, check out the Hammer Museum. The spacious galleries are a great forum for interesting exhibits, and the cafe is a nice place to relax with casual plates and a glass of wine. The free admission is a plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsirin
50,Great Experience!,"This is a small museum, easy to navigate. No charge to enter. Darling neighborhood. We saw an exhibition by Jim Hodges, which was excellent! Diverse art, very talented and I would highly recommend the show. They also had some classical paintings by Van Gogh and Rembrandt. It is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5071MDbb
40,Art and education for all,L.A. is fortunate to have top-rate galleries available free to the public. The Hammer museum is located in a fantastic neighbourhood near UCLA and had two fantastic exhibitions running during my stay. The permanent collection is also worth viewing with works from many notable artists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eMax3
40,A very nice hour or so,"Hey, it's free if you don't count parking fees, but who does in Los Angeles? There is a parking garage below the museum. The classics collection here is small but refreshing. The modern, temporary show we observed was so mindful of a post-graduate art thesis display that we actually walked past some of the pieces. There is plenty of security, though, perhaps more uniforms present than artistic pieces. It was an interesting time spent and art is always thought-provoking. It's an attractive museum. There are a couple of great restaurants very close if you choose to make it an early evening trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonM373
50,Free and great afternoon,There is a very interesting display by Yuri Ancarani including the research through art/photographs of television Anchors on Prime time. Ancarani Exhibits there til Jan.18.Also an exhibition by Jim Hodges.Sunday parking only $3.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurpleLightworker
40,Weird and Wonderful,"A big part of the 4th star is that the museum is now free to the public. Honestly, it's hard to critique a free museum. I've been to the Hammer several times and I think I can sum it up pretty honestly as follows: A lot of the art is highly progressive and experimental (which I enjoy) but oftentimes it feels like the artist is a trying to get at a concept but not quite there, as if it were a college final. I've brought friends in the art world to the Hammer and they felt the same way. Still, I have to give kudos to the Hammer because I have never had anything less than a lovely day of free entertainment there. The curator's taste may not be your cup of tea, but I enjoy being challenged by art, and I enjoy viewing it even if I don't like the particular piece. The last time I went, it was for the showcase of LA artists. I really enjoy this commitment to local art and think that the museum is a great place in the community. Parking is available under the museum, it is just a few dollars if anything (if I recall correctly). The museum is situated in Westwood Village, so there is plenty to do once you leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abbiechan
40,Pocket sized treasure.,"Beautiful building with several distinct gallery spaces. It is quite small but the permanent collection is pretty solid: Van Gogh, Monet, Degas etc. These are offered in counterpoint to more modern works in some of the other spaces. It is pretty small though, so if you are looking for a long experience this isn't for you. But, if like me you were at UCLA and had a little bit of time to spare then this adds a richness to the trip without draining you of time.The (mandatory for LA it seems) gift shop is pretty good too if you are after eclectic mementos or interesting gifts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgstraya
20,"Pretty space, very limited exhibits","The Hammer Museum has a great space and offers a nice island of tranquility in the middle of Westwood. Unfortunately, its exhibits are few and very esoteric. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the Hammer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/too_few_trips_1
30,A NICE ART SPACE,"As most of american museum, the Hammer was build by a californian fortunate sponsor and really the building is great. The personal collection is made of not so important works of famous artists. The important part is dedicated to temporary exhibit like the one we have seen in August nammed ""Made in L.A.with 35 works of artists working together calling Los Angeles they home. The result is not very interesting if we compare with the same typ of exhibition in Berlin or London. The interesting side of the Hammer is better to participate to some lectures or concerts or the visit to LA artists together with an expert of the museum,that could be agood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanPierreB722
30,So so for hanging out,We attended an evening event at the Hammer for drinks and hors d'oeuvres. The setting they provided was mediocre as were the food and drinks. The price for the experience made it even less worth while. My advice to all would be to skip the food here and just enjoy the free museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epi007
20,"Not What We Expected, Disappointed!","The permanent collection was all hidden away and on hiatus. We came expecting to see the Van Gogh's, Monet's, etc..., but were greeted some downright lousy current displays. The Parisian Tea & Morphine exhibit was the only thing that was really interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parisienfoodisgood
40,Good exhibits,"I did not want to sit in my hotel room for the weekend, so headed out to explore Westwood.. Came across this museum and decided to go for it. No regrets. The exhibits are really nice, staff is extremely helpful.We were so engrossed with looking at the collections, we quite forgot that the museum closed at 5 PM. Could not finish one part of the museum, but whatever I got to see was worth the visit in itself!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPNK
50,Take Your Time,"The Hammer Museum is one of my favorite places in California. It is very expansive and the amount of open space adds to the total experience. There is now an exhibit of paintings and sketches from Paris (Tea and Morphine) that will broaden your concept of nineteenth century European art. Also, you could spend an entire day on the static collection alone. The highlight of the museum (to me) is the collection of ancillary pieces in the main gallery. When you go, please make a point of seeing Honor√© Daumier's ""Don Quixote and Sancho Panza."" This one piece is so complex that it will make your entire visit to Los Angeles worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenWilliams00
50,Fantastic Museum,"Loved this Museum ... Beautiful space, easy parking, free admission, etc. We saw the Tea and Morphine exhibit ... It was Wonderful ... And The docents were wonderful ... Everything about this museum is first class ... And I can't say that for LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Santafe23
30,"Small some classic, a lot of weird modern","Went with my wife and my parents. We were there at the time of the Tea and Morphine exhibit.There are about six galleries around an atrium. The atrium has some huge bamboo and there is a cafe which we did not visit. Admission was free ($3 to park on weekends).There is a gallery with some classic art which we enjoyed (about 30 or so paintings). The Tea and Morphine exhibit was interesting but not necessarily world class (i.e. there was some Toulouse-Lautrec but not his famous stuff). It was turn of the century French art and history which we found enjoyable.The other galleries had weird modern stuff, a lot of it ""challenging the conventional notions of good taste"" or cynical commentary on consumerism or materialism etc. The best part of the modern art galleries is to read the commentary in each section. Each has long description of beautifully written flowery prose which is constructed magnificently and sounds great but after reading you have no idea what it means.A nice way to spend the afternoon, but don't expect too much. It's not particularly big and the modern stuff (which is the majority) is more social commentary than fine skill and/or craftsmanship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
50,Fantastic!,"We loved the Hammer museum. From the magnificent artworks to the wonderful outdoor spaces, this is well worth a visit. It is well laid out with wonderful open outdoor spaces. Also, the coffee in the cafe was great.Like so many museums in LA, it was free too!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynA536
50,Hammer Museum,"10899 Wilshire Blvd. Home to the Armand Hammer Collection which contains works by artists including Rembrandt, van Gogh, John Singer Sargeant, Monet, Fantin Latour, Pissaro, etc. I stress quality. While not a huge collection, it's quality is unrivaled. Also temporary exhibits.Parking can be had below the museum for $3 (with validation). A cafe serving an excellent lunch with daily specials. The food is of the freshest ingredients. A well-stocked museum store. This is really a gem and well-worth a visit if you are serious about 17th-20th century art history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moroccantravel
40,Small but impressive (quality),"The Hammer is a perfect art museum for teens who are not particularly interested in art, but can appreciate it a little. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon just 1.5 hours before closing. It was the ideal amount of time for us to take in the temporary exhibits of modern artists, as well as a smattering of the permanent collections. The staff was friendly (except the guards, who were at least polite), the art was mostly very interesting, and some of it was downright gorgeous! The best part was the actual Armand Hammer Collection full of Old Masters. A Titian and 2 Moreaus were my favorites! We loved the courtyard, and hope to return to see more some day. We were fortunate to attend free of charge using the ""Museums on Us"" program sponsored by Bank of America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottT180
50,A hidden gem!,This is a terrific stop if you are in the LA/westwood area. While it is a relatively small museum it has some outstanding pieces from the great Masters. Truly a worthwhile place to spend a couple of hours. There is also a cafe but we didn't get a chance to try it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMS53
10,Empty spaces and not much else,"I guess you always get a snapshot of what is being exhibited on a particular day that you visit a museum or gallery, and all I can say is that on the day I went there was a lot of large empty spaces and not much to see by way of art. The core exhibits were originally a private collection, and in that context are reasonably impressive, though there's nothing like enough of them to sustain a public gallery. There were a lot more staff on hand watching visitors than actual exhibits. I was so uninspired that I actually counted them - and they were all standing around looking bored out of their minds, which is probably what made them so picky in telling visitors where to stand. The cafe was no better, and had almost nothing on sale in the middle of the afternoon, while the So a big disappointment for me after driving round the block a couple times trying to find a way into the place (it's right on Wilshire, though not signposted from the street so unless you're looking sideways at the buildings you will easily miss it). And the designated parking for the museum is down four levels of (on the day I visited) almost entirely empty space. I'll definitely not be back - there are far more impressive galleries in LA. The best thing about it is that it's in Westwood Village, which is a pleasant shopping and restaurant destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theologyprof
20,Disappointed,"I like museums (a lot), and this one has a small collection with some great pieces. But I don't think they really want people to visit...and by that I mean that the experience isn't in any way welcoming. You are allowed in, and for that you should be grateful. The restaurant staff was indifferent, the guards weren't nice and we saw a performance piece that baffled the entire audience, we didn't know it had begun (honestly thought they were setting up late) and then it was over. We all raised raised eyebrows and wandered away. If they have an artwork you're interested in, then by all means -- visit. But looking for a pleasant place to spend a few hours in Los Angeles? You have a lot of other, better options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kate320
40,a small (not too) gem,"The Hammer museum seems to get better and better. They know how to mount and curate a show. Their focused exhibits are much better, in many ways, than the more sprawling ones one tends to see at LACMA or sometimes the Getty. This Spring's Llyn Foulkes exhibit introduced us, with a strong retrospective, to a new artist and his body of work. Better displayed than the same exhibit in NYC, it appears. The Hammer has many participatory and spectator events as well. Easy parking. Don't overlook it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomeTheSecondTime
50,Museum Lite/Light,"I dont mean to imply that the art in this museum is inferior in any way... but the whole feel of the museum is one of lightness. Its easier to park here, easier to walk around. The museum is very spacious, and the interior atrium is filled with light... a very pleasant place. We were there for a Llyn Foulkes retrospective and it was a pleasure to be introduced to an artist we knew very little about. The other exhibits weren't that interesting... sometimes contemporary art is more contemporary than it is art... but the overall experience was relaxing, interesting and enjoyable.And they have a great museum gift/book store with a very impressive children's section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenFeadFields
50,Great contemporary art,"There are always interesting and unusual special exhibitions at this first rate contemporary gallery - wonderful video installations, interesting and exciting paintings and sculptures and a delicious little permanent collection which includes a few fine representative works by some of the world's great masters - there is an amazing restaurant here too and a first rate bookstore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyC289
50,"Very cool, small museum with great variety and fine works","This is a fun museum. Went with my wife and daughter. My daughter is the kind of kid who gets bored easily in museums. The Hammer has a lot o variety and some ping pong tables outside if you get bored. All kinds of media, modern art, great masters. This is a good place to spend an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familyinnh
50,Live from LA,"Since the Hammer Museum first opened in 1990 near the Westwood campus of UCLA, ""It's come a long way, Baby!"" It now pulsates with energy and originality. Come to an exhibition opening and you find yourself among the widest energetic demographic in the city - from 20 Somethings to fashionable folks with walkers! The shows are cutting-edge and sometimes just too edgy for my personal tastes but always fun and interesting.In any month, the calendar offers fascinating lectures, exhibition walkthroughs, book club discussions, poetry readings, movie screenings, public engagement forums and afternoons for kids.I recently had a chat with a gentleman sitting next to me and my husband visiting from Vancouver who described himself as a ""treasure seeker"". He had come to LA to explore our museums and here he was listening to one of three lectures at the Hammer given by our own James Conlon, certainly an LA treasure. This lecture was open free of charge to the public.Visit the Hammer and even if you're not from the LA area, become a member and support a treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShiHu
50,"More than just ""old paintings""","I was here a couple years ago and liked it then. Yes, some of the great masters are here. (As an artist I appreciate that). Additionally, they feature contemporary artists from many different mediums, cultures, styles, etc. And, with the temporary exhibits, there's always something new. The bookshop is very nice and well maintained. Parking in the same building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveR898
30,Go in a Thursday,"I enjoyed the museum, but was glad I went on a Thursday when it is free rather than paying $10 to get in. It has a good collection of impressionist paintings, and the temporary exhibitions on graphic design and paper were enjoyable. The bookshop is also impressive. I couldn't eat in the cafe as the only free tables were reserved, but as you are in the middle of Westwood, there are plenty of other places to eat. I was there for about an hour and a half. Enjoyable, but the Getty centre (free) and LACMA (just $5 more) have much bigger collections so I wouldn't pay to get in here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityGirlAimee
40,Great afternoon cultural escape,Contains some great classic pieces as well as very interesting exhibits. Great to have the parking in the building and also has a nice cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Listu
50,"Small, challenging and satisfying","Located on the UCLA campus, this small museum is filed with splendid classical collections but the contemporary shows are a real draw. Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topnotch_10
40,Nice cozy collection of contemporary arts,"Free admission with really nice collection of contemporary arts eg of van Gogh, albeit just a small room. More to come in future but it'll cost $10 to enter when it's fully loaded. Highly recommended for art lovers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skma
40,Contemporary and classic art together,"The Hammer has a small section of classical paintings which I have not seen. I went there to see the ""Made in LA"" exhibition, the 1st biennial to help people discover the great new talents of LOs Angeles. Their pieces were really interesting and beautiful. We went there on a Thursday (free entrance) and had the chance to benefit from a free tour given by an art student.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanamakda
30,Bad day?,"I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed with the museum. Their traditional pieces consisting of Van Gogh, Cezanne and Monet were lovely to see. However currently on display is "" Made In LA"" exhibit and it was ""just ok"". I was a bit disappointed with the overall feel of the exhibit. And to make matters worse, one of their ""security"" guards were unnecessarily rude and sarcastic when we asked a general question about the museum. Maybe I just went on a bad day, but I don't know if I would consider going again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bguerrero
50,"""Made In LA 2012"" Is a Must See!","The Hammer has its own specific flavor of art, but clearly is moving more into New Media and installations. The ""Made in LA 2012"" exhibit is amazing and I highly recommend staying and watching the films, particularly ""She Gone Rogue"" that I think is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
50,Hammer Hits Nail on the Head!,"I have been to the Hammer many times. One of the best art bookstores anywhere! Always good exhibits. This time my family joined me and we ate at he outdoor restaurant for the first time. The restaurant was worth the trip. The best toasted cheese sandwich ever! I had a great Chinese chicken salad, and my granddaughter had a fish taco--with broiled salmon. All fantastic. And there was a large group of unusual interlocking blocks with a sign that anyone could play with them. My 4-year old grandson was occupied for over a half hour--after I convinced him he could actually touch something in a museum. Parking is only $2 for 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelWacks
50,Surprisingly wonderful collection,"I dropped in to see the private collection and was stunned by what was in this small gallery - Van Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, Sargent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyg714
40,"Small, But Very Much Worth a Visit","The Armand Hammer museum was founded from the art collection of the famous industrialist, but beyond his more traditional collection it mostly houses contemporary art and a series of changing exhibits. It is not a large museum, nor does it contain ""blockbuster"" artwork, but it more than a worthwhile visit.The museum straddles Wilshire Blvd. and another street, I believe Linbrook Drive (the name is obscured on my map). You can enter on either street, but Linbrook is by far the more impressive and in keeping with the general modern tenor of the museum.The museum is on three floors, but most of the art is on the third floor, as is the excellent art book shop. The second floor has a cafe and the Billy Wilder theater.Incidentally, both Armand Hammer and Billy Wilder are buried in a wonderful little cemetery hidden by high rises about a block and a half from the museum. Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Natalie Wood, Bob Crane, and others are there as well.The permanent Armand Hammer collection is worthwhile. There were two Van Gogh's I had never heard of before, let alone seen, as well as one or two nice paintings from several other great 19th century painters (to my recollection, Monet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Pissaro, Bernard, Sargent, and others). My favorite was a French bulldog on a table, presumably the artist's pet, by Toulouse-Lautrec, but there are others to enjoy.They change the contemporary art exhibit. The exhibit I saw was on its last day, so I won't describe it, but I will say that it was well presented. They also had some video of the artist in her studio that was welcome and gave you a good sense of her charming personality as she created her work.When I was there (late April, 2012), they were not only changing exhibits, but also renovating the courtyard in the center of the museum. I think it will be even nicer when they are done.In the book shop I saw a postcard of a work I wanted to see. Apparently, it was not then on display (it is an engraving and likely to fade, so I'm fine with that), but they immediately offered me an appointment to come and see it privately if I wished, which I thought was extremely cool. All of the staff, including the guards, were extremely nice during my visit.The admission is $10 and there is a nice cafe inside. I think it's 60-90 minutes well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineAndGreg
50,So glad we visited,"After walking back from a tour at UCLA, we saw the museum building and decided to check it out. It has a small but very impressive collection of works of art (3 Van Gogh, Degas, a dozen of exquisite bronze busts by Daumier...). There are also contemporary exhibitions. The museum store has an extensive collection of art books. We had an excellent lunch at the cafe. There is a cool seating area open to the public on the 2d floor where you can enjoy a view toward UCLA. The museum is small so the visit can be made in 1 hour which made my teenager even more happy.The place is a bargain : $10 for adult, free for youth/student and parking is $3 for 3 hours (with validation).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeaMM
40,Contemporary and Classical Gem,"Small but unique museum, may be enjoyed in about 90 minutes, A few new unique contemporary exhibitions, balanced by the more classic permanent collection. Also, adjacent is the Billy Wilder Theater, that has some interesting shows, which we were unable to schedule in our time frame. The building design is unique, with a second floor open area with seating and catalogues. A nice gift shop. Make sure to have lunch in their restaurant. The food was fabulous, a great selection as well as wine and beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptcpa
40,HAMMER SMALL GEM IN HEART OF UCLA AND WILSHIRE IN LA,"The Hammer Museum, in the heart of UCLA and Wilshire Blvd., is worth a visit. We saw this museum in about one hour. We particularly enjoyed paintings by Rembrandt, Cezanne, Van Gogh,Pissarro, Degas, Gauguin, Sargent, and Toulouse-Lautrec.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAChuck
50,Culture feast enjoyed in silence.,"This museum was a fortunate find when I had a couple of hours to fill in at Westwood after meetings at UCLA. It has an interesting collection, including the likes of Moreau, Degas, C√©zanne, and Vincent van Gogh as well as contemporary works and special exhibitions I enjoyed very much.The design of the building is with commenting on - it has a beautifully restful space where one can sit and relax overlooking trees. It was a respite from the world outside, and the galleries almost painfully quiet...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyOE
40,Small Gem often Overlooked,Went to the Hammer for the first time last month and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't know what to expect but it is a perfect size museum. We saw two special exhibitions of contemporary art and looked briefly at their permanent collection. The permanent collection is good quality but small so you don't go for that - its the exhibitions that are interesting. The space is lovely with a nice large seating area upstairs where you can relax and look at art books. We didn't try the cafe but it looked like a nice place to enjoy a cold drink or coffee. When you want an easy art experience without the crowds or hassle - think about the Hammer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oaklandish3
50,A Less Dicovered Treasure in Westwood,"Recently,I had the pleasure of visiting the less-heralded Ucla Hammer Art Museum.At this relatively small museum,I saw splendid paintings by;Titian,Rembrandt,Chardin,Pissarro,Renoir,Sisley,Gauguin,and Van Gogh. I saw some Contemporary works by Jan Van Der Ploeg and Ezra Johnson which I also appreciated.My favorite painting was Pissarro's""Boulevard Montmartre"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margatemensch2016
