50,A Quiet Resting Place for Many Pets,"A quiet tranquil place. We were the only ""humans"" there when we visited. Fascinating the many ways people honor their deceased beloved pets. Highly recommended, especially for animal lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Budempic
30,A Tranquil Setting for Beloved Pets,I brought my granddaughters here and they were fascinated by the way that the pets are cared for after their demises. The park is well-maintained in a pastoral setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139herbk
50,Compassion & Caring of the highest order,"Losing a pet is one of the most heartbreaking experiences imaginable. The loss of the sweet unconditional love of a family pet is so painful. The staff here know what you are going through and tenderly, helpfully and compassionately guide you through what comes next. I am immensely grateful for all their help, support and sweet guidance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealScorz
10,PLEASE!!! NEVER GO HERE!!,"In April, I had my best friend and amazing 170 lb Great Dane Rudie cremated here. I bought a very expensive urn from them. Apparently with his remains in it! Months later, I got a phone call from an employee of Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park & Crematorium saying..“Rudie’s ashes are ready.”I said “Then who’s remains do I have?!”Then they had to call me back .. Realizing, I’m sure, that they shouldn’t have called me and that I clearly had another dog’s remains. After talking to them again, I went to their business.The manager and an employee opened the urn and there were two different bags, ripped open to make the weight of the urn feel like a bigger dog. There were CLEARLY two different pet’s ashes in there.. (As you can see in the pictures and I also have the video). The bags just ripped open and stuffed in!! The bag that they had saying “These are Rudie’s ashes” definitely wasn’t as much as a Great Dane would have!They said that they had recently fired the last manager which they had discovered tons of problems that he had caused. For example, there was one dog that had been in the freezer for a year! The new manager said that they had found a filing cabinet full of bags of ashes, so they started calling people. Also saying “Maybe it’s better not to call anyone else if we find the remains” (??!!!)After that, they gave me the remains of the other two pets’ ashes and apparently Rudie’s!Now I have 2 urns and at least 3 dogs’ remains! Absolutely INSANE!!!I can’t believe that this happened and I also can’t imagine how often this must happen. I feel bad for anyone that used this company and whose dogs I have, they could be anyone’s.. This was really hard for me to even put into words how horrible this has been.He was like a kid to me and I’m heart broken.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemL2649LA
40,Greatest Love for Your Pets,The Memorial Park is difficult to find. Use yur GPS. You can spend over an hour reading headstones and ground signs. The MGM Lion is buried here along with many Hollywood pets and performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheldonm421
50,Nice pet cementary,"Visited the cemetery while we stopped at the local historical home. This place may not be for everyone, but it clearly shows some people go above and beyond when saying good bye to their pets. There are sone elaborate head stones and one with even a large picture of a dog on the head stone and bench to sit next to the grave.The entrance is behind and in between a fee warehouse and businesses. When you turn into the street go all the way to the back and make a left. The entrance is about 100 feet from there.I'm providing this info, as we almost turn around and missed it since it does not appear that the entrance would be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,Burial of our dogs,"About 20 years ago my youngest son's beloved Basset Hound, Fletcher, was cremated and buried at the Memorial Park. I was allowed to place the remains in the grave myself and we later had a memorial plaque placed. My son, for whom Fletcher had been a true lifesaver, was deeply comforted by knowing where Fletcher was and that he had been buried with dignity. My son's second dog, an aging Lab to whom he is deeply attached, will be cremated and buried in the same plot with the compassionate help of the Memorial Park's staff. Though I may be difficult for people who are not deeply attached to an animal to understand the comfort that burial and memorializing a beloved pet can give to an owner, I can assure you that even many years after the loss, knowing where you pet is and being able to visit the site can be deeply comforting and important. The grounds are beautiful and the staff is incredibly helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2015fletcher
40,Weird,I accompanied a transportation-challenged friend here so she could bury her cat here. She seemed to take great comfort in the whole process. I just thought it was weird.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,A nice resource in the neighborhood...,When you suddenly lose a beloved pet the last thing you wish to be doing is struggling to find a way to cremate them...they were able to assist us immediately and did the service for us with great kindness and speed at a reasonable price...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalaX2
40,"It looked odd, so I had to check it out","I stumbled across this by accident and just had to go through. I've never seen such a huge pet cemetery. Somehow, it just goes with the Los Angeles and southern California feel of things. Seriously, where else would people get so elaborate with the passing of their beloved animals? Or where can you have find an animal cemetery that may have better headstones than I will when I'm finally pushing up daises!? SoCal of course! Not sure what the plots cost, but it peaks my interest. Could be a good spot to catch a movie star paying their respects to the departed too. Yes, odd morbid, yet kinda cool all at once",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TronKohlhagen
40,"If you're into quirky tourist sites, this is a good place to stop.","I found out about the pet cemetery on Roadsideamerica.com and thought I'd check it out. I was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn across the 101 and it wasn't too far away. The cemetery is huge and it's a nice peaceful area to walk around. There aren't really any celebrity pets, or at least there weren't any that I could find.The other reviews here are from people who buried pets there. I'm a tourist from Minnesota and I found it interesting, but not too terribly noteworthy. There are a few unique tombstones and a lion buried there. Check it out if you have an hour and are looking for a good walk and some interesting viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGski
30,Quirkly Attraction in LA,"It's a long drive out to Calabasas from L.A., but if you're looking for an off beat excursion, with a pet theme, this is pretty good. It's a beautiful park-like cemetary, but all the 'residents' are animals..... and all kinds lions, cats, dogs, birds, etc. Sweet tributes and tombstones for pets with all kinds of names and messages. I recall one dog's gravesite 'barked' when we approached it. Be respectful of course, but this is a one of kind place in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreedomToTravel
50,Wonderful care for our Dog Misty,"Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park is a wonderful place to give your pet a send off. Services by their staff was excellent providing compassion to our family for our loss. Our dog died at home and we carried her to the park the day before viewing and cremation having her placed in cold storage for viewing the next day. They will even pick up your pet if local. We used one of their slumber room that is very well equipped for a small group and have a wonderful viewing and service. They have a CD player in their room but we brought our own audio system so I could use my Ipod.Price was very reasonable. We were charged $175 for viewing and cremation for our 90 lb dog. Cremation prices are based on the animals weight. Although, expect to wait hours for the cremation to be complete. We went shopping and came back later to pick up our dog's ashes. If you want to stay, the grounds are beautiful and a tour is recommended. They have a great assortment of urns and caskets as well but they are optional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalerga
