50,Couples AND Family friendly!,"Exceptional all around! Having stayed at multiple Four Seasons locations and Ritz Carlton this continues to be one of our favorites! From the adult pool,family pool, kids room, spa this place has it all. My husband and I have stayed as a couple and on other occasions wit our daughter. They always tailor our experience accordingly. When we bring our daughter they make sure she feels welcomed in every way possible. The restaurants are delicious but Coin and Cander is our favorite be sure do stop by the bar before dinner it’s a great atmosphere with great bartenders. Lastly the staff is top notch I wish I knew all their names. The bartenders are some of the best we have encountered, Christina from concierge is by far the friendliest, helpful and most knowledgeable concierge we have dealt with and Christian from Onyx made sure we had a memorable night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslyyosborn
50,The spa is the place to visit,Had a wonderful experience at the spa. Everyone there is so well mannered and helpful. This is my second massage there and I have had a facial as well. Great service! I will definitely go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainees2015
50,"Getting ""Glam"" at the Spa","We booked the Rhythm and Hair spa for our daughter, her bridesmaids and several friends and family for hair and makeup services. We had at least twelve people there at one time. The hotel spa made sure they had enough stylists to accommodate everyone in our party. All of the stylists were professional and made us all feel and look beautiful. Excellent service!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/balboa114
50,Massage at the Spa at the 4 Seasons,The Spa at the 4 Seasons is always special. The facilities are so beautiful and relaxing. All the massage therapists that I or my daughter have had are experienced and knowlegable. A special go to place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriae5
40,"An escape from reality if you avoid ""Deal"" Times","The Spa at The Four Seasons Hotel in Westlake offers a broad range of massages, facials and treatments as well as a relaxing and serene environment to unwind and de-stress. Their Spa staff, including those that work hardest, the ladies in the back, do their very best to maintain a clean, friendly and service-oriented spa area. With steam, sauna, 2 waterfall showers, world class fitness facilities, indoor and outdoor pools and jacuzzi's, as well as indoor and outdoor relaxation areas surrounded by beautiful gardens, landscape and peaceful paths to wander. It truly is a beautiful property. I do recommend trying to avoid the ""Groupon or Conejo Deal Seasons"" when deals are offered at for discount treatments at the Spa and very few Hotel or Spa rules are followed. You can be hard pressed to find a locker, robe, slippers, pool towels, lounge chair or any type of serenity when these are going on. It is crowded, loud, many guest are rude, leave their things as well as their robes, towels and amenities strewn about like teenage boys. Normally the spa is very organized and well maintained and appointed. Due to these ""Deals"" the Spa no longer provides many of the amenities they once did, you even have to ask for a hairbrush these days. The poor staff is overworked trying to clean up after the mess and regular guests and members who used to lounge, dine and use the services seek them from outside during these times. Peaceful, it is not! It is sad that this lovely, place is so disgusting and low class when they host deals. One would think they might prefer to offer their discounts via a direct discount program on a regular basis as do many fine hotel establishments on a regular basis instead of ""Deals"", thereby encouraging people to come regularly rather than offer open seasons which destroy their property, its image and force them to remove and eliminate the very things they came to be known for. I have been a guest of the Four Season Spa on hundreds of occassions every year since they opened. I am loyal but I am not sure how much longer I will be. It is plain to see they are trying to keep up with the damages and replace and repair things but at the rate things are being destroyed, unless changes are made or instituted to have all guests comply with the Spa and Hotel rules and the thefts and blatant disregard for the property itself continue, I'm fairly certain, the attrition will continue with their more valued clients and what they have always been, will not be what they once were before. Sad to see, profit by volume in this property has become more important than continuing with the integrity with which it once held. Still, a lovely place to visit, just check first whether before booking. And, if you go on a deal, enjoy, but please don't destroy. Be kind and respect the people that work there. They are not servants to dump upon or demand from unreasonably. They are human beings. They are no different than you, than me, than anyone else on this planet. Treat them well. Respect others, respect property, respect yourself enough to do the right thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seriouslyjo

50,Perfection!!!,Wow... the spa is amazing. So tranquil. The front desk at the spa could be a little friendlier but that did not take away from the experience. The therapists we had Kaha & Tonya were phenomenal. The rooms have natural light which is a nice welcome from most spas that have no windows. The massage table it’s state of the art and ridiculously comfortable. It contours to a women’s body perfectly.The steam room and sauna clean and large. Definitely worth booking a treatment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NPC07

She is a valuable asset to the hotel- her genuine care for us during our stay truly was appreciated. LOVE the fact that they text me when my accommodation is available. That was a great idea incorporated into the check in process. Our accommodations were perfect. Housekeeping staff is true to perfection. Husband refused to eat dessert at dinner.

40,Sunday experience at spa and gym,The staff at the four seasons spa are very accommodating. I experienced yoga in the morning and the body sculpt class ( ouch ouch). Loved the ambiance of the spa. My only issue is they shouldn’t put client lockers side by side. It causes a backlog especially with folks visiting in the locker area. Beautiful fixtures and roomy saunas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FineThingsinlife
50,R&R at the spa,I had what they called a signature facial and thoroughly enjoyed it. They took the time to ask me about any special needs my skin has.

50,Ahhhhhh....,"Walking into the 4 Seasons Westlake a calm comes over me. There's a scent in the air and fresh breeze feeling that makes me smile. The spa is my favorite place in Westlake for R&R with a best friend. We sit, order lunch by the outdoor pool, and when it arrives it is on a tray that goes onto our laps. Oh yeah. Everything I have ever ordered is incredibly fresh and tasty, and after lunch I order a fun cocktail. We hop in and out of the pool and jacuzzi, and sometimes get a spa treatment. I used to be upset that kids were not allowed at the pool. but now that mine are in my teens, I really need that quiet peaceful time that I have so earned. The day at the pool is part of the package if you buy a service, or you can just buy a pool day. The most cost effective day is Wednesday for us locals, and it's much appreciated, thank you Four Seasons!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8481UBginaf
50,Pure Bliss,"I've been to the Spa at Four Seasons Hotel Westlake Village twice (both times my visit was the result of receiving a gift). Also both visits provided the ""whole package"", so I enjoyed about 6 hours of pampering and relaxation and rejuvenation. The Spa offers several different package options, so if you aren't familiar with the scope of services provided, stop by and inquire, the spa desk staff are exceptional and extremely welcoming and helpful. As is to be expected, the hotel offers valet service, but you can also free park in the hotel's free parking area, and its just a short walk back to the spa. You might be a bit tense and worse for wear when you arrive, but when your spa day is over you will be rejuvenated. First Class Service with a smile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibuleo

50,The Spa at Four Seasons Westlake Village,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem: “In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan decree, A stately pleasure dome” is the apt description for the magnificent 40,000 square foot spa at the Four Seasons Hotel Westlake Village. For the past 40 years I have been fascinated by Ponce de Leon, Portuguese explorer, discoverer of “Fountain of Youth”. In his case, it was Florida, in mine California.Impelled by forces, greater than mine, I have searched for the perfect spa/resort. Search over. Verdict in. Four Seasons Westlake Village, with the largest spa in any Four Seasons Hotel is my first, second and third choice. Is it enough? In the words of Robert Redford, The Sting: “It may be not be enough but its close.”Why? First the décor is international elite from the Thai meditation beds off the outdoor pool, to the acres of transcendent gardens with a Chinese pagoda, herb gardens, koi pond, walking trail, reclining lounges, green fields & tropical plants, California flowers and stone sculptures it is a one of a kind outdoor pleasure.While indoors, the Japanese cherry wood bridge, which leads to a skylight Japanese meditation room with bird inscribed lanterns, running water, stone pools surrounded by orchids of many colors, the vibe is clearly “be here now” (Baba Ram Dass for all of you 60s survivors). I think of Krishnamurti (my favorite philosopher) who insisted on enjoying the moment in “choiceless awareness”.Songs invade my mind. Leonard Cohen singing Suzanne, “who lets the river answer” to the Youngbloods singing, “Come on people get together smile on one another” to Bob Marley, “One love” I follow the rapture of great musicians. I feel the spirit of Van Morrison who implores me to keep an “open heart” for when “heart is open” you find the majesties life offers. To Bob Dylan, my favorite “song and dance man” who eloquently stated it best: “to know too much to argue or to judge”. I am in rapture, in pleasure and I am “no longer lost in the rain where its Easter time, too (more Dylan).Where am I? In David Murdoch’s Xanadu (other than Citizen Kane/ Orson Welles film) the ultimate in human achievement. From the murals of birds, fish, flower and trees to the state of the art Jacuzzi, sauna and massage to the perfect massage, courtesy of my favorite masseuse of all time, Yoshiko Connelly, my quest has ended, my search is over. And the staff: Lupe, Cara, Becki, Jenn, and Alexis welcomes you in.So for all of you stressed out survivors of 2016 consider this issue, “what if there was a better way to live”. If you have the spirit, come to the Four Seasons Westlake Village and luxuriate in their spa. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garywW6628ON
40,Relaxing,"Atmosphere in this spa is very relaxing and staff is great. Massage therapist was knowledgeable (deep tissue) and focused and worked on areas really needed 'relaxing'.

Arrive early or plan on staying after to take advantage of the different options pool, steam room, sauna, etc. The pool is lovely, but it was crowded and staff said that is usually the case on Wednesdays in the summer. I wanted to relax after my services but not be in the sun (all shaded spots at the pool were taken). I found a few chairs on a small, shaded patio off the jacuzzi. There was another woman there who said she was avoiding the pool crowds as well and it was great. If time permits, walking the grounds or sitting near the pagoda can be relaxing, too. The shower was fine - water pressure was good and the products available were very nice. Love that hotel guests have access to the spa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannany2015

Luckily we had a cabana reserved as part of our Daycation package which is $265 pp and includes the cabana and lunch and one spa treatment. My mom got the facial which she gushed and gushed about and I got a tepid massage. It's probably my fault and I should have told the lady to be a little more aggressive but I didn't.Our cabana was quite comfy and the day bed was soft and big enough for 2. They have sparkling water and also Fiji water. There is a tv and a mini fridge and once you settle in they bring you a tray of beautiful fruit to enjoy. There are also people that will massage your feet by the pool. Inside by the tranquility pool is a lady at a free chair massage (note times).The locker room is huge and they have everything from hair dryers to razors to q-tips! I imagine if you need something that you don't see they would bring it to you, this place is fancy! And relaxing. If you can't afford the cabana, there are chaise lounges all around the pool with umbrellas that you can utilize.We ordered lunch and they brought it to us at the cabana. The menu by the pool is limited so if you want more choices, throw on a cover up and head to the restaurant.The spa attendants were very good, the pool people were so so.

I relaxed by the indoor garden and she went into the whirlpool and sauna while we waited for our 10 o'clock massages. They were heavenly in beautiful rooms with their own patios. Then we had lunch outside by the pool on a beautiful California day in February. After lunch we had facials at 2 and more relaxing. We were still in our robes, but had put on swimsuits for the pool.It was a great day to share with my sister.The technicians were all excellent. They did not try to sell us anything, which surprised and pleased me. I will definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMB4
30,Just a few Issues,"For Christmas I was given a beautiful gift for a facial at the Spa at the Four Seasons, today I finally cashed in that gift. I made plans to go with a friend and we both made appointments for facials. We arrived a little early (they recommend 30 minute but I would tell you to come a few hours if you can) and decided to put on our bathing suits and lay out at the pool, while we waited for our complimentary smoothy.The pool is so beautiful, I understand why people always comment or take photos of the pool area as it was tranquil. If you order food at the pool, it takes a while to get your food, we only ordered salads and it took a while so leave time! We also didn't know that the spa and the pool area are not connected meaning that if you leave a credit card at the spa for services, you would still need to bring a credit card to the pool to pay for your food. We were not prepared as we only came out in robes/bathing suits.We both booked facials and for the service part of the day, it was great! I had a 50 minute facial and left with my skin feeling amazing. I loved all the oils they used and I really loved the warm towels!!!!!The biggest issues we had or dislikes:- the credit care situation by the pool left a bad taste in our mouth- for being a full service spa, we thought the waiting area would have little snacks (like granola, fruit or nuts) like other spas- we had an issue with the parkingUltimately, it was a lovely experience and I would go again, I just would be better prepared for what to expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patty520
40,"Nice, relaxing spa experience",The spa is nicely appointed and the staff is helpful and skilled. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because the experience was not special or unique. Also parking is a pain because you either have to valet at the hotel-which isn't especially convenient or park in the garage which is too far away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1968lesliek

When you book an appointment for any spa service, it includes all spa amenities. Love the sauna, steam, and jacuzzi. And that's all before you settle down into a beautiful room with a nice comfy massage table. I've had a few different types of massages along with facials and they all have been wonderful.

I've had my fair share of nice spa treatments and salons, but this one is hands-down the best! The massages are pure bliss and leave me feeling so relaxed and rejuvenated. Honestly, though, the waiting area are amenities are enough to de-stress your body. The common area has comfy lounges where you can lay in your plush robes, sip on herbal teas, munch on fresh fruit, and listen to calming music. In the private spa area, there are steam rooms, saunas, jacuzzis and every bathroom amenity you can imagine.If you want to treat yourself to something special, then save up for a spa day at the Four Seasons - it's worth every penny and you'll feel the difference for days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natanya85

She was fantastic. It was truly relaxing. Even when she did my normally ticklish feet it was wonderful. Not even ticklish. First time ever not ticklish.Four Seasons Hotel speaks for itself. If you live near as we do or you are staying you should treat yourself to a Fantastic Massage by Christine. Ask ahead for her you will not be sorry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeDubiecki

20,"If you're looking for a quiet, relaxing spa - this is NOT the place!","It breaks my heart to have to give the spa at the Four Seasons Westlake such a low review because the spa does have a lot of nice elements. It is a beautiful spa and one of the largest, but sadly it has gone down hill A LOT in the past few years. The last time I was there, there was no robe or slippers in my locker and I had to wait 20 minutes for someone to finally bring them to me. Dirty robes were piled high on a cart and left in the hallway for more than the 30 minutes that I could see them while getting ready in the locker room area. The bathrooms had no hand-drying towels when I got there (around 1:30) and they were still out of them when I Ieft at 6:30. RIDICULOUS.But my main complaint is the crazy amount of noise and chaos they allow to go on in the spa, which makes it impossible to relax and feel anything close to peace & tranquility. Considering the prices of their spa food and their treatments, which are MUCH higher than most other spas, you would think that they could figure out a way to keep people from talking so loud.The ""relaxation"" areas are right off the pool, which is used by all the hotel guests looking to go drink and party. So every time the door opens you hear tons of laughing, screaming, and people yelling to one another from across the pool. As if that wasn't bad enough, no one at the spa does anything to keep the noise level inside the spa quiet either. There are no signs posted in the main waiting areas or resting areas, and the staff says NOTHING to other guests as they pass by noisy groups all chatting freely, playing games, and basically talking in full, loud voices.So I say, if you are looking for a peaceful spa experience you will definitely NOT GET IT at this location! I think that a lot of their usual customers have stopped going because of the ridiculously loud noise level, and they have lost a lot of business - which must be why they are now discounting a lot of their services and selling MASS amounts of coupons on Travel Zoo and other sites. The result is that they are flooded with the kinds of patrons who probably don't even know what ""spa etiquette"" is and who are just there to throw back a few beers, and get a discounted massage, who then come out of the treatment rooms making all sorts of noise and continuing to get very loud with their friends, disturbing the usual, higher-end customer, who has paid top dollar to be there and enjoy what they had thought would be a peaceful, relaxing day. SHAME ON YOU FOUR SEASONS! The Westlake location is giving the whole brand a soiled name and reputation because they can't seem to figure out how to post some signs and enforce policies for quiet. That shouldn't be rocket science people!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyf783

30,Not well managed.,"I was there this weekend. The steam room broke, the staff came back but took off so they never saw if it was fixed or not. Took a few times of telling them it wasn't before they stayed to make sure it was done. The jacuzzi has tons of gross foam on it the three days i was there. EW! Including a photo. The massage room they put me was flood lit! So i had an afternoon massage with bright light coming in sort of how not to create a relaxing experience or Spa 101! One day you walked in and got a locker. The next day you had to walk back to the desk and have someone open an locker for you. No one explained which you needed to do as you signed in. Really not the place i remember from my prior visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelticGirlLA

50,Last minute spa day,"After another local spa failed to honor my preset confirmed appointment I called Four Seasons at 230...who graciously received me for a 3:00 massage and a 4:00 facial.As a four star I will simply state the grounds, amenities, and staff are above reproach. Subtle, elegant, and classy-- you won't be uncomfortable.The massage was lovely. I spent 6 years as a massage therapist before medical school so I tend to grade them a bit harder than most. I was disappointed that when I requested extra work on my hands and recently sprained ankle that was not granted. I sensed the therapist knew one routine and didn't have the experience to vary her timing and techniques and it was certainly not a true Swedish massage but the pressure was nice as was the therapist. I did except a better skill level out of a Four Seasons therapist and spa though.The facial was extraordinary-- and exactly what should be expected: Competent, well educated, knowledgeable and friendly. Absolutely the best facial I have experienced.There is a package: tranquility massage and an organic custom facial. Book this and arrive early for time in the lounge, pool, steam rooms...and plan to spend some down after with a cup tea and solace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor_Rose_Kansas

Additionally the staff were helpful to me in answering questions, offered me an herbal health drink, and were very courteous. While I did not utilize the main services of the spa I did enjoy sitting outside on the chaise lounges for a while and that was very relaxing. There are some beautiful birds in the area which occasionally fly around the pool area where there are some nice shrubs. While I don't remember what they are called I had not seen their kind before and it was a surprising delight for a nature lover such as myself. The grounds just outside the pool area are fantastic. They have a pond and some interesting architecture over a small stone bridge which you can see on their Expedia photos. I like the featured image in particular. The rest of the hotel is also quite nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623arjunr
50,"Beautiful Spa facilities, pool and ambience","i have been to so many spas all over the world and The Spa at the Four Seasons Westlake Village is truly top of the line in every way. The lobby entrance to the spa is filled with aromatic scents of tranquility and relaxation. Although i only live 40 minutes away, i felt like i was in another world spending the day here. I had an organic facial and it was lovely. My facialist marty did an excellent facial massage and was very knowledgeable about all the products used at the FS Spa. The pool area is beautiful and peaceful While relaxing poolside , we were offered samples of a passion fruit smoothie, ice water and even a foot massage. Juan came around to everyone at the pool offering this complimentary foot massage which was amazing, i would definitely ask for him to do a one hour massage next time i return..The ladies locker room was beautifully decorated and very clean. The sauna, steam room and jacuzzi were very inviting.They serve food at the pool and we had already eaten in the hotel but otherwise the menu looked light and healthy and relish.The relaxation lounge where we waited for our treatment time was beautiful, relaxing and elegantValet parking is only $5 with a spa validation which was a nice touch.This is definitely a spa to see and make sure to spend the day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susannaa2000
20,"Treatments went well, but staff was condescending","I ventured to try a local treatment value package offered by Four Seasons in Westlake Village. When I arrived, I did not have my certificate and the staff were ambivalent to try to help locate it on my iPhone (I can't see the fine print). I returned to my car to get the certificate. The program included 3 extra passes for future visits and a glass of bubbly upon arrival. After being introduced to the spa rooms and having to ask about the champagne, Alexandria seemed annoyed and told a fellow employee to 'give her another one'...as if I had one in the first place. Then, I asked about the 3 extra spa passes and I was told that they expired on June 30, 2014. My appointment was on June 29, 2014 and I was never told about this time restriction when I made the appointment at the end of May and only when I asked. When I asked about bringing in 3 guests on June 30, both Ashley and Alexandria answered that I could, but that 'the spa was completely filled so it will be very crowded'. Their demeanor was definitely trying to dissuade me from coming in the next day. For the price I paid for the certificate and the relaxing experience I anticipated, this is not what I call a customer service-oriented establishment. There are so many choices of spas in Westlake Village...I think I will opt for those with better customer service in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarjorieL416
20,Beware of Spa Voucher,"If you bought a Travel zoo voucher, beware. If you do not make reservations to use your day passes, they will not be valid due to over capacity. I made a massage appointment in April, shortly after purchasing my voucher. However I was not told on the phone that in order to use my day passes, I would need to ""reserve"" those spots. Needless to say, I will not be able to bring my friends along for the day passes. They are basically wasted. I have called them numerous times, but no one seems to be able to help. Otherwise I have been to the facilities before and it is very pretty. I do agree with Wesley S. a previous reviewer that you have to flag someone down at the pool in order to get any service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gingerita1
50,"A lovely, relaxing massage at this spa","It's beautiful, soft, feminine. It's crystal chandeliers, softly dripping fountains and comfortable chaise lounges. It's the Four Seasons and it does not disappoint. I had the aromatherapy massage and it was so wonderful I think I just slept for about 1/2 hour afterwards on the chaise outside the rooms. The pool was very full so I didn't go there but instead went to the hot tub indoors and the eucalyptis steam room. The staff was very helpful and the Four Season's elegance was lovely. Get the valet parking for $5.00 and tip. The spa will validate for $5.00 so you only pay tip. A lovely day at the Four Seasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawJ811LW
10,Massage Great! All else well below average,"I bought a travelzoo voucher (2 of them) for this deal that included 2 50 minute massages (which were great!) and access to the pool and all spa accommodations. Also included with the voucher is the ability to go back to use the pool area with up to 3 guests prior to June 30th on either Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday or Sunday. We planned with our guests to go back on a Sunday but when we went to get our spa massage services they told us hand written on a piece of paper that the days of Friday and Sunday were no longer valid. When I asked to speak to a manager about trying to help us since the second to last Sunday in June is the only day that would work for us to fully redeem the voucher a manager would not speak to me and the attendant would just say this is non-negotiable. Furthermore the service at the pool was down right atrocious. You get complimentary drinks with the voucher but no one asks if you need help to redeem so you have to fetch down the multiple pool attendants who are hiding and socializing in the back or simply walking around the pool area ignoring customers. I left their with a bad taste in my mouth and would have rather just given my money to Burke Williams cause even though they dont have a pool they have great customer service!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655wesleys

30,"We expect MORE from a Four Seasons Spa, Lacking","This is not our first time at this spa. In the past we were disappointed and nothing has changed, still disappointed. This is not the typical Four Seasons five star experience. Further, many of the spa guests I spoke with had similar feelings.1. Pool area: still slippery - unsafe.2. Pool staff: took our lunch order, 45 minutes later we had to inquire when it might be ready. The server said, 'oh, I'll go get it now"" - and returned with the wrong items. He then asked ""what exactly did you order?"" So I guess our original order was LOST.3. Couple next to us had similar problem with lunch, the wrong items were delivered to them. He returned with one correct order and forgot the other.4. Spa amenities: Lacking some of the five star amenities that you expect at a Four Seasons. Example: No cold washcloths available, many ladies using the steam room were looking for cold washcloths and commenting on how ""little things like cold washcloths"" are the difference between a five star spa and a less than stellar Four Seasons spa experience here. In fact, the entire spa had NO washcloths anywhere, cold or even for showering.5. Organic Facial: Do NOT waste your money! The products used are nothing special - in fact, the fragrances are irritating and cause breakouts, allergic reactions. The facial is putting on one cream, wiping it off, putting on another. The esthetician did not give a good facial massage at all. I get really good facials and this Four Seasons facial was really a waste of time and money.6. Massage: While it was a nice massage, the first 10 minutes in the room was spent answering questions for the therapists form (PLEASE NOTE: I was NOT late, I was 50 minutes early. I even asked when I checked in if I had to complete a form and was advised by the receptionist that the therapist would take care of that when it was time for m appointment!!!!). So my 3pm massage, the therapist takes me to the room, then ask questions and fills out the form, after the form was complete she began trying to upsell me to either a shea butter cream addition, or a menthol arnica tea tree oil treatment, or aroma therapy. She never gave the price for these ""add ons"", and this upsell attempt just took time from my 50 minute massage. Very annoying. Personally, a 50 minute massage time should be spent on the massage, and NOT using 10 minutes of the 50 to complete a questionnaire and be pressured to purchase ""additions"" - Four Seasons Westlake: If you are reading this review, please know that this behavior is not typical of a five star spa experience. This behavior is ANNOYING and NOT POLISHED SPA SERVICE.The spa facility is lovely, but again - use some cold washcloths near the steam room, offer regular washcloths in the showers.No one offered me spa slippers, but no big deal because I brought my own anyway. Just sayin' - five stars offer spa slippers.No teas were available - just water and a basket of hard pears.The locker rooms did not have many amenities that five star spas offer - and many ladies commented on this, so I know it is not just me noticing.Toilet paper was not in all the toilets - no one was checking to make sure things were kept up.Lockers: many ladies were having problems opening the lockers and were told that the batteries were dying out.Overall - I have been to better Four Seasons spas. The facial products here are not very great, the facial was lackluster, and the 50 minute massage was really 40 after the form filling/upsell.I was disappointed in the service at the pool.So overall - nothing has changed. Our last experience was not very great and nothing has improved since then.We have a special package that was given to us for a future visit - so we will be back but I won't expect much because I will end up disappointed if I hope for any improvement.The Lobby Restaurant at the hotel is lovely. The service is nice. The menu is limited but if you do decide to dine: try the Braised Pork Shank - it is incredible. The clam chowder is also excellent. The wine list is good and quite reasonable. The restaurant was relaxing.As for the pool staff: don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam

30,Fours Seasons Disappointment,"I agree with Norcaltransplant . I really did expect more. The staff was great ! And the hotel and waterfalls,etc. were beautiful ... but it lacks in all the important details . I've worked in some great country clubs and resorts , hotel and restaurants for over 35 yrs and was really disappointed. The bed sucked ! Didn't get any rest or relaxing there . The staff was sweet to want to help ... but there is only so much you can do with an old mattress ! The springs even made noises . I've have better sleep in Vegas at 40 bucks a night . Now what really got me to go there was the fact it is a wellness center, etc... but I didn't understand the way they did their restaurants. May be 5 stars but they weren't open ! And Italian buffet on a Sat night , who wants unhealthy pastas for dinner with salad with the dressing already smothering the lettuce .. Sunday brunch at 60 $$$$ each again Vegas is better quality and Sunday night for dinner, well the bar menu is available. Monday morning was 17 dollars for two eggs ... and again I can get better bacon at Smart and Final! Seriously !! Where I told the waitress I couldn't have wheat , may I have some potatoes instead , she said NO , no substitutes . I think a few potatoes , are cheaper and healthier than bread !! and at 17 bucks ???? At a 5 star hotel I don't want to hear NO on anything !!! We ended up spending over $300 just in food ! We are just working folks so it was alot to for us, but it was our anniversary and wanted to go somewhere special . I don't think a place should take advantage of people just cause they are rich and are willing to pay these high prices for poor quality. I heard a lot of people both at dinner and breakfast whispering and as confused at the meals . And I""m not promoting Vegas by any means , but they really understand at the nicer hotels , that the quality means something even if you get a deal on their prices doesn't mean you have to sacrifice on comfort or taste. Oh yea parking 26 bucks a day !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyG948
30,"Good Experience, but Expected More","When you hear the name Four Seasons, you expect an experience that's at a much higher standard than other hotels. While our stay at this property was pleasant, I wasn't blown away by their amenities, on-site food, room service, and rooms. In other words, I didn't leave wanting to rave about the hotel or wanting to come back.A few caveats: I did not make use of the spa and I was unable to use the outdoor pool as infants (I was travelling with my family) are not allowed. We were allowed to use the indoor pool which also has an outdoor patio area with lawn chairs and umbrellas. The smell of chlorine in the indoor pool area was bodering on nauseating and we had to call to have people clean the outdoor (patio) area outside the indoor pool as we were met with food on the floor, uncollected food trays and trash. This was all on a Sunday.I'm not a stranger to room service, but I must admit that this was probably the most expensive room service I have ever encountered. The onsite restaurant close to the lobby had decent food, but the kitchen seemed unorganized as our appetizer took a long time to reach our table, entrees came out soon afterwards and dessert took too long to make it out as well.The grounds are very pretty with dramatic waterfalls outside and an original pagoda. Beautiful stone work throughout the hotel. Friendly and accommodating staff (probably what the 4 Seasons does the best).Food options near the hotel are mediocre. Plan on eating at the hotel during your stay. Terrible wifi throughout the hotel. Bring your own 4G card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norcaltransplant
50,Peaceful and relaxing,"There's a beautiful waterfall wall with orchids, and comfy lounge chairs to read or drift off into la la land. Plan your visit for early morning because it can get noisy, when they are busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriH268
50,A-MAZ-ING,You need to just walk through the spa and you know it is four stars. I had a massage and it was one of the best ever. The pool is also nice and had great service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggieboo12345
50,Relaxing day at the spa!,"I have visited The Spa at the Four Seasons Westlake Village about 4 times and have brought multiple friends along with me. It's a far drive for me (about an 75 min) but I always have an excellent massage, facial, and day at the pool. My friends and I arrive about an hour early to check in, change, and enjoy the sauna and steam rooms before we have our treatments. There are very comfy over-stuffed chaise lounge chairs everywhere and you will see fellow spa guests relaxing on them. My friends and I enjoy the calming, quiet atmosphere while in the spa before and in-between treatments. After our pampering, we head out to poolside to soak up some beautiful California sun. Take a dip to cool off, enjoy their delicious (small) lunch menu, and visit with other guests. They play great music and even have a garden that you can stroll around (pond and pagoda included). Overall a perfect day at the spa!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktgolf
50,Fabulous Massage & Atmosphere,"Since I live in Westlake Village, visiting the Four Seasons spa is the closest thing to taking a vacation for a few hours. I visited the spa because I pulled a muscle in my lower back. I had a massage last December and was very impressed with the skills of the massage therapist so decided to take this route to treat my injury. After an hour and a half I was on the road to recovery. The atmosphere and decor of the spa is calming and Zen like. Just writing about this makes me want to go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junetalks
50,Bliss...,"Have been going here for years... great atmosphere; serene. Massages are always fantastic. Pool/food service could be a little quicker, but otherwise great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBrownie
50,Love the spa!! Great experience!,"I love Westlake Village Four Season spa, my husband comes out for his physical every year to the California Health Institute. I go to the spa and they have wonderful treatments. Well worth going, great staff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327Travel
50,Amazing massages,Expensive but very skilled massage therapists and a great environment with excellent facilities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sting800
50,"Fantastic, Beautiful, Relaxing Spa in the Area","Lush and Beautiful. The spa is uber clean, uber relaxing. Beautiful orchids and waterfalls surround the quiet room. The pool is large and offers cabana's. The treatment rooms are the largest rooms I've ever seen. The facility is just uber fantastic. The treatments are pricey though. The hotel offers packages and they are the best way to experience the spa. Hang at the pool before or after your spa treatment. The restaurant and grounds are great, try the Friday Night Seafood Buffet - it is the best buffet you will ever find!!!! Fresh food, clean, pretty environment and the food is fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam

50,"I'm not a spa person, and I want to go back!","My title says it all; I am not a big spa person, and this place easily made me rethink my viewpoint. The massage I received did wonders for my back and I was amazed by its effectiveness. The staff was wonderfully attentive, and did not work to rush us through anything. If you can afford it, go here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AncientMariner924

40,Huge Spa area and gracious staff,The Spa is as beautiful as the hotel. I had a massage treatment that was good but I would not drive to this location just for the spa. Nice pool area and lounges.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GFInow
50,Great Spa Experience,"My friend and I went for her birthday. Our appointments were at 11:30 but we checked in a little before 10 to take advantage of their gym. The gym was great , equipment was in great shape. We then used the steam room in the spa (there is also one down by the gym) . We then went and waited in the beautiful lounge area for our app. My Swedish massage (by Leslie) was amazing. American Express had a spa promotion - you got an 80 minute massage or hydrating facial for the price of a 50 minute. My friend got the facial and said it was really great.We then went and laid by the pool (it is January and the temperature was in the high 70s!) where we ordered lunch. Lunch was good and would really recommend the Cucumber Crush drink. The sunscreen they provide you with smells amazing. Also, all your water and hot and cold teas are complimentary at the spa. The robes are so comfy.I will definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamc1061
50,CHLI Medical @ Four Seasons Westlake is Fantastic!,"CHLI Medical @ Four Seasons Westlake Village is fantastic! I had energy healing with Barbara Savin, and it really helped!Also had their dentist whiten my teeth, and some botox with their dermatologist. All in one day!I'll be going back there for my annual mammogram, and it's the first time I'll be looking forward to having my mammogram! I'll treat myself to all the other fun services that day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaGirl42
50,The best Spa I have come across,"This Spa did not disappoint. From the moment I walked in it felt like a magical oasis with the fragrances and music you come to love when you want to relax. The tranquility lounge was amazing with all of the beautiful orchids intertwined with a unique water feature. I had a facial called the Signature Kate and it was the most blissful 80 minutes I have spent in a long time.Loved it so much I invited my mom, aunt, and cousin 2 days later for a girls day, enjoyed a massage, had lunch by the pool, and returned to my room feeling blissful once again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmanhattan55
50,Seeker of good massage,"Talk about first class. You won't find a more amazing experience. We had massages scheduled for 3:00 pm but checked in at 11:00 just to enjoy the facilities. We had lunch by their adults only ""Serenity Pool"" laid in the sun took a nap in thier ""Tranquility Lounge"" and then went in for the most amazing massage I've every had, and I have had many. My Therapist name was Patty (ironic) Strong hands, firm massage with the perfect rhythm and flow. She had a gift of healing and put me in another place. The staff treats you like royalty and the yummy waters and teas were all included. Even the yummy smelling sunscreen was included. We ended with Jaquzzi and steam for me and sauna for my friend. I can't wait to do it again. Well worth the money. A must go!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seekerofgoodmassage
50,Dropped In For A Visit To The Spa,"I am a local from Thousand Oaks who decided to drop in after work for a facial. I of course made a reservation as they suggest. I used the self-parking option. The parking garage is about a 2-3 minute walk, but you might like to use the valet.After arriving I decided to add a massage treatment which the staff person was more than happy to accommodate. They give a short tour of the spa area and then set you up with robe and slippers and then have you wait in the beautiful lounge area for your technician to come and get you when it's time. It is a fine ambiance with LOTS of yellow walls, and asian style decor. Overall it is calming and relaxing as is expected. The waiting area is pleasing with the wall of fresh orchids in a waterfall setting. My facial and massage were perfect and the staff is super friendly and happy to serve you.I have been to a few different spas in the past including the Ojai Valley spa and the Four Seasons spa is right up there with the best. So if you come for a visit just to try the spa on your own or with a few girlfriends it will be very satisfying!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishtop
