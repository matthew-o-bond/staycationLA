50,Sriracha Factory Tour @ Huy Fong Foods,Interesting free tour!! Can't wait to go again so I can enjoy the experience with more family/friends! Incredibly interesting & educational. Was in town visiting family and thankfully our friend Ami A. suggested this tour. Easy to get to and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Must-See tour for EVERYONE!! The tour is about an hour long but give yourself time to spend in the Gift Shop because that is fun to enjoy as well. Definitely bring a camera or cell phone since taking pictures is allowed.,Jennifer L
50,Sensational,"The Huy Fong Foods tour was really well-organized. It engages every sense. The origin story is really a heartfelt story of success. David Tran, the founder, is an inspirational figure. I love his passion and commitment to every aspect: people, product, and more. The factory is very clean. There is a gift store and he is very generous about not charging a licensing fee or other ways of upcharging, so that the products are very reasonable. I am proud this business is in our area. It is very casual. We went as a couple. There were families present. They are sensitive to persons with disabilities and advise from the start there are eight steps. You travel in these neat electric carts.",RMMcD
50,Free tour,The tour was well organized. The inner workings of a factory are fascinating. Guides were friendly. We really enjoyed seeing the process of one of our favourite condiments being made from manufacturing the bottle to packaging for shipping.,AndresMacL
50,Sriracha Tour! At Huy Fong Foods,We loved the tour! It is a free tour. My hubby and I visited the site in Irwindale and enjoyed the whole experience. It was very educational. The whole factory is ran in such a neat and organized way. It was very surprising to learn that the founder still shows up to work there and is so humble. We definitely recommend.,Angie D.
50,Never thought I'd visit a Sriracha factory,"Found out online that they do free tours and thought ""Hey why not?"". Turns out it was awesome! The tour is free but you do need to reserve in advance. I learned a lot about the plant and the history of the company. I had no idea that all the branded Sriracha merchandise was actually royalty-free. The company does not make any money from those T-Shirts you see at the store.You actually get to see the bottles made and the sauce put into the bottle!The tour is around an hour long. At the end you end up at a gift shop and you get a free small bottle of sauce. And I got a cute themed umbrella! This is a great tour for kids and families.The plant is about 40 minutes away from LA but I highly recommend it. There's an In and Out on the highway there.Note that you can smell the spice. They provide tissues for you to cover nose. It wasn't an issue for me but I noticed others using the tissue.",Justin H
50,Great Sriracha and tour,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Sriracha factory tour. If you have an hour or so while in the area, it's something worth doing. The process from making the plastic bottles to filling the sauce bottle to the storage and shipping, is fascinating. I would love to go back when the chili pepper is being processed for an even better experience.",Prius909
50,Fun Tour of Sriracha Sauce Factory,"Learned a lot. Great experience seeing what goes into the production of Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce. Started sneezing in the area where they opened the barrels of chili sauce so it can be pumped out for bottling (our tour guide handed out tissue to cover the nose). Potent. Got a pretty close up view of bottling and packaging. Driven around in a cute ""chili sauce red"" cart. Great friendly tour guide. Last stop was the gift shop where we picked up a couple of t-shirts and received some free samples. Overall, good place to visit for foodie photo opps!Tip #1: Look for the LARGE Visitor Parking sign in front of the main entrance along Azusa Canyon Road.Tip #2: Sign-up for the tours online.",ColinO123
50,Process and Chemical Technology Students,"The tour was excellent! The touring guides provided anything that was necessary prior to the tour offering both restrooms and water fountain availability. The information was very educational with regards to the founding of the business and the science behind the product. David Tran has allowed openness and visibility in the production of his famous Sriracha sauce. LATTC students are very grateful for being allowed to tour the facility as a class and being inspired by such a successful entrepreneur. Thank you touring staff, security, all employees, and David Tran for sharing so much with the general public. Thank you also for your free samples!",Gustavo Acero
50,Sriracha experience,"The tour was fun and interesting. My whole family went including the kids. We got to tour their big warehouse full of machinery and assembly line where they make the sauce. The tour guides were very friendly and knowledgeable about the CEO and history of the company. They later took us to their store where they sell shirts and accessories. The facility is clean, lots of free parking, easy to find and we enjoyed the tour.",alazae2019
40,Srirachi Tour,Tour was interesting. Factory was spotless and extremely well organized. Tour guide was well versed in all aspects of the factory. Aroma not overwhelming but some people might be sensitive to the smell of the product inside the factory.Overall a fun tour.,Wanderer666006
50,Fun and interesting.,"When I looked online for factory tours in Southern California this one popped up. At first I thought hmmm, Maybe. I am so glad I went. I use siracha at times but some are crazy about it. I loved learning the history behind David Tran and how it is made. We saw him on the tour(he apparently goes in most days. There is a ten min video before you start that is funny and informative. The guides are great and know their stuff. There is a gift shop with all sorts of merchandise relating to siracha. As we left we each got a product and a siracha umbrella.There is an open house each year in Aug and Sept. All free.",chrissnelson
50,Really cool experience!,We had a great time on the factory tour! They told us all about the company culture and the true virtuousness of the founder and CEO David Tran! We learned how the factory works and the processes and efficiency of the manufacturing. Really interesting stuff to see! They had a cool gift shop and free sriracha at the end of the tour!,steve129877
50,Highly recommend!,"I surprised my son (who loves all things spicy) with a tour of the factory during our recent trip to LA. It was so interesting, incredibly clean, and everyone was friendly. Definitely worth checking out!",Shana S
50,Awesome tour!,This is a great field trip for a small group! Each person even got a free bottle to take home! Fun gift shop too! I got my college age son a pair of underpants there! :),Amy G
50,Spicy morning!,What's not to like about a free tour that smells of sriracha? The tour guide was very pleasant and informative. All this and a free bottle of Huy Fong at the end. We all had lots of fun.,czarinae
50,Impressed,"I was expecting to see food product being made but I was impressed at the story of the CEO David Tran. He is a selfless man with principles. His story was inspirational. The tour itself was also very nice and the kids enjoyed the tram ride. I also liked that the factory uses natural light rather than electricity, and makes and recycles their plastic bins. Will definitely bring friends and family again.",Natalie
50,Surprisingly Interesting,"While it's a fairly simplistic tour, it's incredibly interesting to see how the various hot sauces are made and to learn the incredibly history of Sriracha sauce. Definitely add this to your agenda if you find yourself int he area with about an hour.",Lothar W
50,Awe Inspiring!,"I've toured many food processing factories over the years; most of them great. But Huy Fong Foods is awe inspiring! Its story, from David Tran's desperate journey from Vietnam to the success it is now is what makes America great! I visited in January and watched the precious sauce as it was being bottled. I would love to come back during the months when they are processing the peppers. The tour may be scheduled online and is a must for devotees of spicy food!",olga_rpv
50,How it’s made,"Today was my very first tour of a factory. Boy let me tell you, the Sriracha tour was awesome! First off, it’s free. Second if he is around you get to meet this short but very nice Vietnamese man who’s working along side his employees, he happens to be the founder of the company. The employees will wave and are very friendly. It’s an incredible tour and the gift shop is great and affordable. 10/10.",knighttimedragon
50,"Free, friendly, fast","The founder and company don't take themselves too seriously. They have a fun bent to them, and when it comes to a free tour, how can you really complain? There is ample time for all the questions you might have. Minimal walking required for those who need to know of possible mobility issues (there is a little tram to take you around).",JJKFETP
50,Sriracha factory tour,"I was not expecting much, but was super surprised and blown away by the end.The history of the beginnings of the company and founder is truly an example of the American Dream, where anyone can accomplish amazing things so long as you work hard.My heart goes out to Mr. Tran, who had (and still has) the a business model that is more concerned with the quality of their products than anything.I am still trying to process that Huy Fong Foods only does three products, yet does them all to perfection.I will definitely take the tour again, hopefully around the time of pepper harvest so that I can witness things on a different level.If you are anything of a spicy food enthusiast (like me), I would recommend taking a trip to visit the factory and take the tour.If you have an interest in business startups, this is an awesome example of how to do things right.Mr Tran and Huy Fong Foods will continue to have my business with their Sriracha sauce, chili-garlic sauce and chili sauce.",Papa
50,An amazing story!,We use their products and have for over 20 years but we are now more loyal customers after hearing David Tran’s story and his business model. The tour was fascinating and we were amazed at the efficiency & cleanliness of the facility. My husband is a retired Marine who has exacting standards and he was extremely impressed & his comment was “The military could use them as an example of how to do things right!” The gift shop was fun and we truly appreciate the gift of Huy Fong products at the end of the tour....thank you!!,cdenoi
50,Clean factory,"To get on a tour, you have to get a reservation online at least a month before.Prior to the tour, you watch a short video of how the founder started. It’s amazing how he grew this operation internationally from his humble beginnings as a refugee who used to be a farmer from Vietnam.After watching the video, you ride in a tram to view the factory operation. When we went there though, the trams were not running, so ended up on a walking tour which I think is better as we see theOperation closer. It’s surprising how they keep the factory clean. After the tour, the guides take the group to the gift store and each visitor gets a free small bottle if Sriracha sauce or a jar of chili paste.It’s so generous of them to give away their productsand the employees are nice.",MIKE D
50,Hot & Spicy tour!!,"We went Oct 25th for the tour, we were visiting LA for the week and my wife and brother-in-law love the Sriracha sauce for several years. I thought it was a great option to get to know the history and the warehouse where the Sriracha is being made. The employees from the Security guard to the tour guide are amazing people. First part of the tour is a 20 mins video that tells the history and fun facts about the sauce and the founder of the company. After that the tour guide (forgot her name) drove us to the other side of the facilities and explained to us and showed the facilities. After all questions were answered and got to see the place and know about the vision of the founder we went for the gift shop that is really a bargain on almost everything. I am not a fan of spicy sauce or food, in fact I do not eat Sriracha but had a great time on this tour and even got a shirt on the store. :) Highly recommended and..... THE TOUR IS FREE!!! Just make a reservation to guarantee your spot and be on time.",Alexgarocr
50,Excellent tour,A fun and informative tour on our favourite sriracha chili sauce! The free sample and the gift shop with very reasonable prices was the cherry on top! Definitely worth a trip but book early. They only offer tours on weekdays.,dezza00
30,Homage to the Sriracha sauce we all love,"Truth be told, the only reason to partake on the free Huy Fong Foods tour is to visit the only factory that produces their 3 products. Actually, I only thought they only had 2 products and only learned of sambal oelek (chili paste without garlic) at our visit. Although the factory plant is massive, the operation still has a family business feel to it. Viewing the wild selection of Sriracha themed T shirts in the gift shop is worth the trip.",Edward C
50,Such a cool place,"Our family, which included a 5 year old and 14 month old, had a wonderful time visiting Huy Fong where the rooster sriracha is made. There is a video at the beginning which is fun and allows for people who are a little late to still participate in the tour (that was us). The security, even in the parking lot, is on point so don't show up unless you have a pre-booked pass. There were lots of photo ops and they openly welcomed videos and cameras. The tour guides were friendly and informative, and the tour itself was very cool, and its incredibly clean inside. The kids really enjoyed all of the moving parts, especially the robotic arms that packed the pallets. It's definitely a must-see especially if you love sriracha as much as we do. The little gift store is fun too - lots of great souvenirs to pick up. We asked them to get some magnets though! Final reminder: though the tour is free you still need to go to their website to book a time slot for a tour in advance.",chickabeegrrl
50,Fun and Interesting Tour,"We really enjoyed this tour. Plan about 2 hours or slightly less. The facility is really impressive - huge, clean and high-tech. The video introduction was interesting and the tour takes you all throughout the factory. This tour is way more comprehensive than the Tabasco factory in Louisiana. The gift shop prices are reasonable, too. We highly recommend this tour.",Mary B
50,Awesome free tour!!,We loved it. Highly recommend. Amazing story behind the company and so much fun. Very informative and generous samples at the end. Smells are fantastic.,Michelle G.
30,Underwhelming,"We love these products and were happy with the free gifts at the end of the tour. BUT this experience was not really worth the trip. First, there is no signage for parking or where one goes to sign in for the tour once you're parked. We watched a video for 20 minutes or so until it was abruptly ended by the tour guide and we went into the plant. In the plant, most on the tour could not hear what the guide was saying (loud plant and soft spoken guide). Nice factory. Nice story. Not so nice tour.",jamesmD3016MY
40,Fun factory tour,"Highly recommended. Easy to schedule on line, then show up for about a free one hour tour. They drive your around part of the factory, and you walk around another part, so you get to see the massive operation and the assembly line of making bottles, filling bottles, packing into boxes, etc. You end up in the gift shop but they give you one free product and you can purchase T-shirts, etc. only if you want to, no pressure. I didn't catch the name of our tour guide but she was great, even though she's only been on the job about a month.",Bill B
50,Tour was a great experience!,"Love the three products. Use them all the time. We live in Western Australia and it was great to be able to do this tour. It was run very well. Everything was explained well. Would love to be at an open day in August, September or October though. Thank you for a great experience.",arboots
50,Paying homage to Sriracha,It’s super kitschy and super fun - just like all the fans who swear by the greatness of Sriracha sauce. The tour is well done and includes an up close inside tour of the factory and processing facilities. Make sure to reserve on the website and bring closed toed shoes!,loveDCA
50,Terrific Tour,"The facility is huge - an entire city block. They have 2 ""buses"" that take you inside the factory. There is a gift afterwards. All for free!The story of David Tran is the culmination of the American dream.",jmseight
50,Great Tour!,"This was such a fun, informative free tour. It lasted about 45 minutes. There was one spot with stairs, but could be avoided if necessary.Our guide Daisy was very nice and knowledgeable, answering all of our questions. She didn't use a microphone but we could hear her because we had a small group and the machinery wasn't too loud.At the end of the tour, we got to choose a free bottle of sauce (no free bag or t-shirt, but everything in the gift shop was fairly priced).There was no availability on the calendar online, but I called and was able to join a group anyway. I highly recommend this tour if you have a chance to take it!",CW1
50,Huy Fong Foods Tour,You learn the history of the how the globally famous Huy Fong Siracha sauce came about to the world. You go to their factory and learn the whole process. Check their website to make sure they have tours available. Best time to go is during the Fall season when they harvest because there are more activities and freebies.,atjig
40,Nice way to spend a couple of hours.,"The tour is well organized. Too bad on tyre day of our tour, the microphone used by the tour guide wasn't working so we couldn't hear very clearly what she was saying. But otherwise, it was a worthwhile excursion.",Stephen L
50,Free Fun/interesting,"This place is easy to get to and great place to visit if you like the Sirachi sauce and smell of peppers. the best part its free , its a guided tour with a group of 12 shoes you the hot sauce is made and where the peppers are grown. From making the bottles/containers to the sauce being poured all views from scratch to finish. At the end of the tour you get a T-shirt and Small gift size bottle of Sirachi Sauce.",A8018LAjamesc
50,Amazing Tour,What a great experience- fully immersive factory tour. Free family fun for all ages. Highly recommend,Venture728393
50,a thursday outing,"interesting ,informative and quite the horatio alger story. ASIAN sauce makes good in the USA Tour of modern food processing plant and special machines to operate .",Stanley D
50,Great tour!,If you love the famous siracha sauce - this is a must visit! The tour is free but you have to register in advance. At the end of the tour they also give you a small bottle which I thought was a nice touch. The tour is about an hour or so. Overall a fun and insightful experience.,itsxjackie
50,If you love Sriracha this place is a must to visit!,"Went in for a tour and loved how organized and clean facility was. Beware though because if you have a sensitive nose the chili smell can get to you. Overall, definitely recommend this factory! They also have a great gift shop filled with anything and everything Sriracha!",ImTropical
50,A EXCELLENT TOUR FOR OUT OF TOWN GUESTS OR FRIENDS EVEN!,"I have been taking out-of-town guests & friends to see this operation on Mr. David Tran by his hard work & just by making his chili sauce tasty & he started by working hard and treating his employees very well,.Mr. David Tran is a very fair person to all his staff. His employees very highly of him.",dsai
50,"Super comprehensive, only 30 mins","In the short time we were there, you get the chance to see the full warehouse, on site bottle making process, all the millions of drums that store peppers, the bottling process, and to learn some fun facts. Its astounding how much they make in an hour. I'm beyond impressed with how they dont push products on you from a gift shop, and offer a ride in a cute little golf cart to take you around this GIANT COMPLEX. Its worth it. I will be going back for life!",Hanna J
50,A very interesting look into a working commercial food processing plant.,"This tour is a really good insight into the processing, bottling and storage of a very successful commercial food plant. Our tour guide was very professional and provided a high amount of knowledge of the complete plant from the start of the sauce making process to the end. This plant is extremely clean and nearly all areas of the plant are open to the public except for the one room. The tour is very interesting and roughly runs for about an hour, as a thank you from the company you receive a small bottle of sauce for attending the tour. At the completion of the tour you are taken into the rooster room(gift shop) where they sell a wide range of clothing, sauces and other novelties which are really well priced.Highly recommended",wayde w
50,Fun free tour during the chili grinding season- seed to sauce!,"#sirachalove The Irwindale manufacturing facility every year around pepper harvest time gives free 1 hour tours whereby you can do a self-guided tour to observe the pepper trucks coming in and the process of making the best hot sauce ever. The tours (starts at 10am and there's one every hour until 4pm) are usually the 4 Saturdays in September and takes about an hour. If you call and reserve a spot, you're guaranteed parking and good free swag (Siracha drawstring bag, your choice of the 3 popular Huy Fong hot sauces including siracha, and a Siracha T-shirt. However, you don't have to have a confirmed tour to do the tour- it just guarantees you parking and swag. The plant is very clean with self-guided tours walking around the perimeter of the plant. It's pretty cool if you are curious about how things are made - from seed to sauce, bottle making to filling, etc. The Rooster store has readably priced kitch items including a good selection of T-shirts. Go to Huy Fong Foods website for more details.",SolanaBeach2014
50,A fantastic tour,"Sriracha Sauce is enjoyed in 26 countries. It is a hot sauce enjoyed by millions, also being kosher.I saw that they give tours of their factory so I went. We were driven around on a large golf cart. See my photos.Since 2013 Huy Fong Foods is in a 650,000 square feet facility in Irwindale. Initially they had problems with neighbors who did not like the smell but now there is no problem. The name of the company came from the Taiwanese ship that took the owner from Vietnam to Hong Kong. He is an ethnic Chinese. Something is lost in the translation because the Chinese name is the Chinese name for HSBC.This is chili harvest time and in the lot were several double trailers emptying jalapenos into the roasters. Huy Fong only buys peppers from Underwood Family Farms.Sriracha is made from peppers, sugar, garlic and not much else. They only have three products, Sriracha, Chili Garlic, and Sambal Oelek, my favorite. They make just about everything themselves, the sauces, the bottles, the storage containers. The factory is highly automated and uses robots. All were designed by the owner, David Tran. Full-time staff is only about 100. According to our tour guide emplyees get full medical coverage paid for. The entire factory is cleaner than a hospital.The business philosophy is very conservative. They make what they make and that is it. There is no research into new products. There is no tie-in marketing.Except for a small gift shop there is no retail sales. We each got an 8 ounce bottle for free.",WWLL
50,Fun place for tour,"Got a manufacturing tour of the facility and it was so much fun. It was chili grinding season and so the factory was operating non stop even on weekend! There was lion dancing shoes, complimentary snacks and free t shirts! Awesome",Iris W
50,"Huge building, great tour, fun guide.","Made the reservations and stopped here after work on a recent trip to California. Check in and head to the training room for a quick overview and safety talk. We climbed into the cart and our guide, Claudia, drove us around the building tot he back. Along the way we passed several truck bringing peppers into the building.We were taken through the bottle manufacturing, bottle and blue barrel storage area among other places. The grinding room was off limits on the day that we were there as they are ramping up for grinding season. Maybe next time that will be open.After the tour and as usual, you exit through the gift shop. T-shirts /, posters, and other swag are available for purchase at very reasonable prices. 2 thumbs up for the tour guide as she was thorough and personable.",craig c
40,Made in USA,The tour is very interesting and the tour leader very knowledgeable about the history of the product and the manufacturing process. Everything except the bottle caps are made in-house. Produce is from local farms. All chilis used in the sauce are from a single farm. September is chili grinding season when special tours (also free) are available on the weekends. Lots of fun stuff in the gift shop.,zscore
40,Sriracha plant tour,Amazingly modern and huge manufacturing and storage plant. Seems like an efficiently run place. Smell inside the plant was not overwhelming at all. Tour was short and wished there were hands on components to the tour.,Nick C
50,Interesting Way to Spend an Afternoon,"Came here with work to check out the facility. We toured the facility and learned everything we have ever wanted to know about Siracha. At the end of the tour we went to the company store where we loaded up on hot sauce, snacks, and memorabilia.",Rafeek626
50,Excellent and different - great way to spend an afternoon,"Easy to find, free parking, free tour. Sign up online at the website, reserve your tickets early as they sometimes tend to sell out, especially at harvest time. The tour was informative, loved the story of the owner. A true American dream story. Hearing about the company and the owner made me like the product even more. The tour was about 45 minutes and you should allow 15 minutes for the gift shop. Everyone in the tour received a free bottle of sauce. Great experience, even the non Sriracha lovers in our group liked the tour.",Michelle O
50,Daycare/Summer Camp Tour/Fieldtrip,This is our second year our summer program attends to their tour. Kids and staff love it and it's so close by our location. The staff is also great! So far we been having an awesome tour and will continue to book tours every year for our summer program.,belaire816
50,Worth the drive,"We did the tour on our last day in LA, and it was great! It was very informative, and amazing to see how they make just about everything on site. Free bottle of product at the end was a great surprise too, especially for a free tour. They filled up our (purchased at the gift shop for $1.50) 'Sriracha to go' bottles that are TSA sized so we had some for our flight home.",Llamalah
50,Intersting and Informative,"As a high school economics teacher I am naturally curious and interested in factory tours, especially when they are free. I took my 13 and 10 year old kids and they really enjoyed the factory tour as well. I plan to bring my students here in the winter because they will see real world examples of the concepts we study in economics. Besides being informative, the tour just leaves you feeling good about the opportunities available to people in this country with a dream and a goal. Through hard work, anything is possible.",Suzanna H
50,Very good experience,It is wonderful to know how one person's dreams can come real thru hard work and dedication. The owner is a down to earth person and very caring to his people.,Vaju2016
50,Love the Rooster!,"We took this tour Friday afternoon after arriving at LAX and it was definitely worth the hour drive each way. Even though it's pretty short, you really get a sense for the care, integrity and honesty that David Tran imparts in his company and product. It was pretty impressive. For Sriracha freaks, there's a whole gift store full of at cost merch at the end.",jonathanhopwood
50,Awesome Sauce!,Short and spicy tour. Sign in. Watch videos. Get acquainted with the product in the welcome room. Very professional tour. Showed us the nuts and bolts of the operation. Can't wait for the harvest tours in Sept.,Martin C
50,Fun tour for Sririacha fans,A very well organized tour in a very fine factory plant. You come close to the manufacturing of the world famous sauce. All staff is very friendly and helpful. This is a must for all Sriracha fans.,Claes O
50,Fun tour,Free! Tour is less than an hour. Guide was friendly and informative. Tour end with everyone getting a free bottle and a chance to shop for ridiculously underpriced mementos.,lchicagolaw
30,tour was a bit average. Still do this tour!,"the tour guide did not seem to be able to answer questions. They put plastic over the sides of the trolley, so you could not see things for part of the tour. They thought it was going to rain.To see the massive factory, and see them make their own bottles and see the massive pile of sauces in different points of the process is impressive.You also get a free small bottle of Siracha at the end of the tour.I would recommend, though which the actual tour was better. It deserves better!",B138877
50,Fantastic tour,We had a great off chili harvest season tour of the facility of the legendary sauce. We were the only ones in attendance.No problems parking for free. Met by armed security who had a list of registered visitors. Had the golf cart tour of the factory floor as well as a walk through of some key areas. Didnt meet David although apparently we drove past him working on the floor. Factory is quite unique in that it tries to be self sufficient rather than relying on logistics. Tour guide was very genuine.Got free mini bottles of sauce and tshirts one per person.Off season there are no strong smells.Don't wear the tshirt in Irwindale. Some locals are not thrilled.,tm007
