50,Namaste,I have been taking yoga classes with the staff from Yoga Madre for several years. All the instructors are extremely knowledgeable and willingly give alternative movements for all the positions for those with injuries and other issues.The instructors vary their routines so they are not always the same. I consistently go to the classes being taught by Maggie. I love the manner in which she instructs us. I will continue going to this intimate studio.,65macpete

40,Cute Village Yoga Studio,I'm not huge into yoga but I have been to a few classes at Yoga Madre. The instructors are always nice and helpful. They have a variety of classes and times so I think there is something for everyone.,Laura H
40,Nice studio for walk in yoga,"Everyone was very friendly. They were running a 2 for 1 special. Attended the 'Gentle' led by Kitty. She was a great instructor. But, she is also a very talented singer. The session ended with her singing a soothing melody to a light guitar accompaniment. I would go back when I visit the area again. Be sure to go around to the back of the building-they are on the second floor with a back entry.",Liz K
