10,"expensive, high HOA and no AC",My friend lives there and the AC is controlled by the building which sets the lowest andhighest range so u cant even control AC. Also maintenance is terrible and the so called facilities include a 100 ft gym with 1970s equipment. It is a great location although West Hollywood isn't what it use to be- The same to lambos by sunset plaza and too many tourists visiting whats left ofthe resl sunset strip.It all a bit sad-just like that building.,zbvcxzbvcx

The come and go in their luxury cars and slow down for NOTHING. Lived across the street for 2 years, met ONE person, ""ICE T"". He was super polite and super nice. Drove a $200k car. Took me for a spin. Let me drive. Not too many people will let you drive their very expensive cars!",Jess90069
