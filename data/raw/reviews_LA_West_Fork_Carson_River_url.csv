50,Great place to fish and hike,"Visited here two weeks ago and was very surprised what a fun place to visit. A great place to fish for trout and several hiking trails along the river. My wife and I fished for about a half an hour and would've fished longer but it was 41 degrees outside and were not prepared for that kind of weather since we left Plymouth, Ca. at 76 degrees and decided to go for a nice all day drive. Would like to go back though and fish with some extra layers on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbI6383RP
