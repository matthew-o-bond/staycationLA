40,Transfer from inhospitable industrial area to residential area,"The change goes furiously fast and what a year ago felt a bit odd and extraordinary feels like it is getting ready for the big masses.Still worth visiting, in terms of restaurants, cafes and partly exciting street art",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Arts district is showing various amazing artists,"Itâ€™s a nice and tiny area, best you leave your car in one of the parking areas for 10$ flat rate and start walking ( take a map with you or your mobile better) and walk and watch the various artists and Little Tokyo too. Easily in 2/3 hours you will see a lot. If you want a guided tour there are many offers. Itâ€™s a lovely scenery and many cafes invite for a pause.Try it not too late, otherwise it is full. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sven-Papa
50,I could be here all day!,Wow L.A. has gotten so much cooler because of the Art District. Tons of interesting murals and public art in every corner. Be sure to look up because you could find some interesting wire art like we did! Cool shops and restaurants too. Very walkable if you can endure the heat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julietengwilliams
40,venture out here for exotic restaurants and mural scene,"This location is bounded by little tokyo. I actually have spent time at angel city brewery(microbrewery) and have visited wurstkuche(exotic meats). The eateries here tend to be unique like the pie hole. Also, if you are into wall murals there are a good number of murals around. Its definitely a place for those tourists who are looking for a little uniqueness in their visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,Street Art haven,"Fed up with the faux glitz of Hollywood, loved MoMA and The Broad? Then the Arts District is a must! In the process of regeneration the street art is incredible and there are pop up shops, cafes and an excellent kids park. Take your time to explore the streets and discover new murals dotted on every available wall space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiannaS539
50,The only similar area I experienced is Wynwood in Miami,"A hotbed for creators from all arenas, making it one of the cityâ€™s most exciting neighborhoods to visit. If you like street art, it's exciting to see these amazing wall paintings.The area is under the realm of the property owners and is likely to change at a rapid pace.Nice selection of exciting new shops, cafes, restaurants,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,A different experience,"This neighborhood is experiencing a transformation. Some areas are still abandoned, but once you find the right streets you will enjoy everyone of the graffitis and the work that local artists are developing in each wall bringing back to life this part of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECAM53
50,Great area,Visit this area if you really want to be and do something special. It breathes an amazing vibe and the breweries and food places are simply the best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BramN_12
40,Major LA Redevelopment,"This area (warehouse district) of downtown LA is undergoing massive redevelopment; and all for the better, in my opinion. What used to be run-down and (some) abandoned warehouses and factories is now being slowly transformed into a contemporary hip neighborhood. There are brand-new apartments, lofts and condominiums. There are new restaurants, retail shops and art galleries. I have never seen such a high concentration of young people in their 20s and 30s, as those living, working and shopping here. Re-development has been going on for about 10 years. The place has probably another 10 to 15 years to go until it matches the likes of New York City's SOHO, Chelsea, and Meatpacking Districts. This is definitely a walking neighborhood, so park your car and walk around. The one issue however, is that it can be a challenge to find parking. But it's there; you just have to drive around and look for it (meters, parking lots, etc.).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBrasilian
