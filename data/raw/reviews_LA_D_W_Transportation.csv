50,"On time, fantastic service and reasonably priced","Wagner organised my trip from LAX - San Diego, San Diego - Palm Springs and finally Palm Springs - LAX.All the pick ups were on time, car was clean, service was impeccable. Rates we reasonable and communication lead up to (and on the day), was fantastic. Highly recommended, will definitely use them again for my next visit.",Shiv_sydney
50,Complete and Reliable Service,"I’ve been riding with D&W for 2 years + now and have found them to be the most reliable service I’ve used. When it comes to transfers - on-time arrival and communication are super important.All the drivers I have seen from them have been great - in particular Desi whom I’ve referred to friends and colleagues alike.This company has great, clean cars and will bend over backward to make sure you’re happy. Wouldn’t ride to and from the airport without her.Highly recommended.",Mike D
