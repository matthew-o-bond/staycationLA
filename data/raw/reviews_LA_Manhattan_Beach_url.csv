50,MB big time beach. Small town feel,The greatest beach spot in SoCal. MB is no longer a sleepy little beach town. But maybe it is. We just had our downtown baseball little league parade complete with the mayor in a convertible mustang. The fire truck. The Mira costa marching band. And cheering parents. Small town. You bet!! Always a great time for the locals and their friends. If you are lucky and can recognize them. You can spot celebrities and professional athletes hanging out at Starbucks and coffee bean. Or walking and running on the strand. Highly recommend!! @nickellfamilytravel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel

50,Great place to stroll and people watch!,"We actually were going to visit the pier and wound up parking a long ways away. So we wound up strolling down the strand on the wonderful walkway. Quite wide, and goes past numerous beautiful houses and apartments. On the other side is a special bicycles only path and then down to the beautiful quite wide sandy beach, which barely slopes down to the ocean and waves far away! What a sight! so fun to watch all the people on the strand. So LA !! You can walk for miles - literally!

50,Very nice beach walk,"We arrived at Manhattan Beach on a sunny Tuesday afternoon. The beach is very wide and has lots of beach volleyball nets set up for the many games that were being played at the time. There were surfers out in the ocean riding the numerous waves. As the beach area is large, it did not appear to be crowded at all. We opted to go for a walk on the very long beach walkway in a southerly direction. A very nice way to spend the afternoon! Up from the beach from the Pier are several appealing restaurants and shops. This area of SoCal is not touristy and seems to be teeming with locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garysanderson

Clean... no garbage. Bathrooms with outdoor showers. We parked up the street, about a 10 minute walk in parking garage for a nominal fee. Great Cali beach vibe. I myself prefer Huntington beach... more of a surfer vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melindae91
50,Very California.....,Nice 90 minute walk from Westdrift Hotel along the Veterans Pathway. Manhattan Pier is a great turning point and the Esplanade is worth a walk for a while.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonmJ65ZH

Of course it will remind you a few films :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonyLux
40,"Huge Beach, Lots of Sand Dollars","We stopped here during Labor Day weekend, so I'm not sure if it is always as crowded, but there were a lot of people around. Thankfully, the beach is huge, so it didn't feel like we were sitting on top of anyone. We found a public parking garage, but had to drive around for a while before we found that since a lot of the parking in the area is permit only. When the tide went out later in the day, we found a bunch of beautiful sand dollars in the water which was awesome. We were able to do some surfing, though there were times that there were too many people playing in the water to do it safely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllergieswithAmanda
40,Great area,Had a long 10 hour layover at LAX - Decided to take a trip to Manhattan Beach to spend the time. It was only 15 minutes by taxi.

40,Weekday Beach Fun,"Manhattan Beach has a nice public pier with sweeping views. On a weekday we were able to find available metered parking adjacent to City Hall. What I really liked was that there seemed to be both a walkway near houses and a separate bike path next to the sandy, extensive beach area; thus, bikes and people weren't competing for the same space. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Beautiful and never crowded beaches,"Manhattan Beach has some of the most big beautiful beaches in all the world. This time of the year the water is very comfortable and crystal clear. The town is almost exclusively residential, especially near the beach and parking is very limited which is a drawback for visitors sometimes. But the benefit is that the beaches are never crowded.

That garage door means someone lives there, and you are blocking their access to their home. It gives residents no pleasure to ticket and/or tow your vehicle, let alone going to find a metered spot for their own car, or having to take an Uber because they can't drive their own car out of their garage. PLEASE spare yourself and the residents the stress and expense of parking your car anywhere other than a meter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarostars

But you can guess why he stopped us... Anyway, Umm... Duh. Then, an angel sent from heaven came out of his house and wanted to know why the police were ""harrassing"" us. He was nice enough to personally give us his parking pass and told us not to worry about it and to have fun and place the pass in his mailbox when we were done. Talk about a blessing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melaninmunrow

40,"Great town, but expensive","Having lived in Manhattan Beach for 23 years, I've seen many changes. As high end stores come in, so do higher prices and fewer parking spaces.

50,California upscale beach town -,"Original beach bungalows and houses cost $2,000 new back in the 1920s and 30s. Now the cost per square foot soars to over $1,000 and beach cottages have given way to the McMansions of this age. The ‘tree section’ remains closer to the original (try Marine Ave) while the strand homes shelter the wealthy who enjoy the beach vibe from behind their compound walls. Cool restaurants and nice shops and walking areas abound. Check out the Kettle and Uncle Bill’s, Pancho’s and the pier. Do walk the strand and put your feet in the sand. It is scenic and energetic place. People watching is a past time. Manhattan Beach is a must stop for any visitor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billiebear1

10,All Hype,"I’ve lived in El Porto for 5 years now. Moved from Newport Beach to be closer to work. Manhattan Beach is noisy, old structures, polluted (next to a hyperion plant and oil refinery), overpriced, no parking, kooks galore, unfriendly, all hype. The sidewalks are filthy with peoples dogs poop and the street sweeper just pushes the dirt off the road onto the sidewalk. Traffic is horrendous. A bunch of spoiled, unfriendly, rich people that cant surf. And everyone from LA comes here because its the closest beach and its where the 105 west ends. If it werent for the easy commute i would never set foot in Manhattan Beach. Landlords rent crappy, tiny apartments for top dollar because of the hype. Orange County is much much nicer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6159KIadams
50,Great beach close to LAX,A colleague from LA recommended this area since I was looking to go to the beach for a few hours directly from the airport.

Definitely worth stopping by even if it's a quick trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c9017
50,Loved the Marvin Braude Trail.,"I was there for a few days in May/June. Loved it! I would also go back in an instant-especially to ride that trail. I stayed up on the boulevard, so it was a mile and a quarter walk to the beach everyday. The hotels on Sepulveda are right for my price range, as the ones right on the beach are triple the cost. Staying up there is the right thing to do if you want to visit on the cheap; you can still enjoy all that the beach has to offer. Rent bikes at Hermosa Cycelry, which is right back from the pier, as I couldn't find a cycle shop right in MB. I ate at Brew Co. a lot which is near MB pier. I can't say enough about the friedliness of the LA people, it is a very laid-back atmosphere. I had an excellent experience where a couple actually lent me a bike on my first day there. Can you imagine that? I would reccomend going there later in the summer, especially if you plan to do any beach lounging. If you like to just wade in the surf all day like we do in the east coast, well you better just head to Myrtle or Florida where the water is warm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside727252

40,nice photo opp on a bike ride,This makes a nice photo opportunity (on a bike ride to or from Hermosa Beach) with its white and turquoise structures and waves crashing against it.

Cute town to walk around as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fappug55
50,Surfing haven,I chose this beach for first time surfing lessons. It’s such an amazing beach. I can’t wait to go back. You feel a connection with the water and people who are very friendly. The beach is clean. I stayed at El Porto which is the northern part of Manhattan beach. The waves are certainly challenging for surfing but it’s a great training ground. Check the tide levels before you go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgnitaPandian
40,Great Stop on PCH,Enjoyed traveling down PCH on a long stopover at LAX. Enjoyed strolling on beach walkway and pier. Parking is available and can pay with credit card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgkuhl
50,Nice Beach And Town/Beware of Parking,"We used to visit California all the time but now dread it and try to avoid anything California because the once nice must see attractions (including the beaches) are deteriorating and turning into toilet holes (sorry but it's true!) But Manhattan Beach area is still indeed a nice place to visit. The beach and small downtown area is clean, safe and pleasant. We enjoyed the shops/restaurants/bars along Manhattan Beach Blvd about 10 minute walk from beach. Please know walking up from the beach is all uphill and may not be feasible for some. The area is nicely diverse with people of all ages.Please Note: Parking is extremely difficult to find, not sure if this is a daily problem or only on certain days and times but reading other reviews it sounds like it's an issue. Parking is all metered and strictly enforced. As we sat having lunch we watched parking enforcement stop and check EVERY car writing tickets (gotta pay for all the bs somehow so why not target the tourists so they never return...real brilliant Cali!) Also be aware some meters are for only 24 minutes (not a typo ""24 minutes"" lol!) You think you were sooo lucky to find a spot and then realize its only for 24 minutes hopefully you didn't put your money in yet! What a great money making trap for the unaware tourist. And the other meters have time limits too most we saw were 2 hour parking limit so please be aware and check the meter before inserting your hard earned money. You could probably find free parking on the outskirts of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7066VSlisas

10,Bad Beach Parking Options/Laws,"We are from Denver and came to LA for a summer getaway that also celebrated my 49th birthday. Wanting to spend a day in what we thought would be a great last vacation day and my birthday celebration, my husband dropped us off after having no luck with parking anywhere. After an HOUR of driving and circling same streets repeatedly, something finally opened up! Meters are only 2 hours and they strictly enforce policy of having to vacate parking spot completely and finding another spot. We admit we only refilled meter and didn’t relocate so we are at fault. Please consider building another parking structure or increasing meter time as this is not a situation that is visitor friendly. Thank you also to Officer Tibble for the pricey parking ticket and for putting a damper on my birthday and the last day of our vacation. It’s a great policy if you want to keep your beaches free from anyone who can’t afford to live in your nearly all-white beach town for the rich.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyfoust4
50,GREAT BEACH,"We were only in Santa Monica for three days, so we had to decide whether we were going to spend a day at a Malibu beach or Manhattan Beach. After listening to the locals, it seemed Manhattan was the beach to go to, and they were right. If you are from the NYC area, I will say that the town had a Hamptons feel. I liked the beach, and the little town that was just up the street. We sat close by the pier, and used the bathrooms right before getting onto the Pier. It worked out great. We took about an hour Uber ride from Santa Monica to Manhattan Beach which was only $30 going and less than $30 getting back - very cheap compared to Uber prices in the tristate area. If you can, try to eat at The Stand - it's got a gorgeous view, and great food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leenie18

40,Great beach stay,"We love this beach...very upscale area and staying here is pricey--but proximity to great sea view, beach culture and restaurants make it worthwhile. It is interesting that beach neighborhoods like these in L.A. are homes of the Very Rich and are in sharp contrast to Central LA which is seething with poor and homeless. Meanwhile middle class populations in inland townships like Anaheim and Pasadena are are slowly dwindling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hooliganite

50,Beach is awesome!,"This vacation was dedicated to going to the beach. We went twice to Manhattan Beach. The beach is awesome! Parking, however, is another story.

Traffic is really busy in this area, so be careful. There are bathroom facilities at this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bitsmom_tn
50,Clean and beautiful,"One of the better and cleaner beaches. Beautiful boardwalk and houses to admire along the way! The water was ice cold in May, but surfers still went into the water.

50,Beautiful and cozy,"We (me, my wife, 12 year old and 11 year old) loved the beach. It has a great Bike path and walking path that run alongside the beach. Not a touristy type beach, very cozy and comfortable. It also has plenty of eateries and shops as well as a great pier.

30,Noisy and Congested,"I wasn't overly keen on this beach, possibly picked the wrong time to visit as there were several school buses parked nearby from which hundreds of shrieking children erupted and quickly filled up the beach. There is also little room to walk around due to the 2-way cycle path. If you want a quieter area I would advise walking up to Hermosa Beach which was a lot more pleasant and had a nicer pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelly0692015

It was beautiful and much quieter than Santa Monica and Venice beach.We had lunch down by the water and wandered around the pier. There was also a cool little aquarium which you could visit at the pier which would be great for families with kids.We wish we could have spent more time at Manhattan Beach as we fell in love with it!

I noticed some small trash on the beach but other than that the beach looked clean. This beach does need more trash can though.

The former would be extremely crowded with those who want to be ""where everybody is"" (literally, it is SO crowded!) and the latter with those who would appreciate more space, less noise, more quality than quantity.

The entire beach was filled with families and everyone was having a blast. This beach was very serene and peaceful.

Volleyball nets are up, there's a section to surf/body board, etc. I would recommend being close to the pier so you can get to the restroom when needed.

50,"Great for a stroll, a night out, or just the view","My in-laws live in Manhattan Beach, so it's such a treat to come for holidays and family gatherings. It's a great little town with a clean stretch of beach often frequented by surfers and volleyball players -- but still space enough for runners, swimmers, and sunbathers. The pier is a great perch for enjoying the breeze during the day, but it's best at dusk to catch the sunset. And if you want a pretty walk, the Strand is a great walking path with a view. Just watch out for cyclists!The town is a bustling place and one of the wealthier, more polished beach towns in the South Bay. You'll find lots of eateries for every budget, coffee shops, and stores for browsing. One family favorite for Mexican is El Sombrero, the original location on Manhattan Ave. The Coffee Bean's fun blended drinks and Noah's Bagels are both great morning haunts. The stores are on the more expensive side, though, so I prefer just to look.You'll find most of the action along Manhattan Beach Boulevard from the Strand to Valley Dr., and a bit on cross streets Manhattan and Highland Aves.

This is by far, is one of our favorites. It smells the best and it's has a great bike and walk path. Some beaches smell like rotting whales, others have oil on the sand that stains your feet, shoes and belongings. This beach has a long stretch - a good 5-10 miles of beach walk that bleeds into surrounding beaches: Playa del Rey, Hermosa, Redondo. It can get crowded but not so much so that people are in your personal space. There are beautiful homes that line the strand, a multitude of unique shops and tasty eateries. Nearby Trader Joe's and Wholefoods. It's a nice mixture of down to earth casual and upscale. Everything is on the pricey side and affluence abounds. There's just something about the energy of this beach that we found more peaceful than most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glamour_traveler

50,Beach Expereince Galore,Few places along the Southern California beach community provide the experience that MB provides. To begin with there is a beach front sidewalk and bike path (separated) that runs the entire length of the community. Drive to the downtown pier and you will find numerous restaurants and retail outlets that fit into everyone budgets. Parking can be a challenge on the beach during the busy summer weekends but just a few blocks away parking can be located. MB is a very safe community that provides a wide range of community services that are available to all. One of the unique features of MB is the wide beaches which are only rarely crowded because of their expansiveness. The MB pier provides an opportunity for all to wander about 100 yards into the ocean environment--photos under the pier are a must for the visitor. If you want to check out the multi-million dollar homes that line the beach front sidewalk just meander along the sidewalk any day or evening of the week and peer into the windows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrBobUSC

50,... this is the life,"If people have not realized it yet, Manhattan Beach beaches are so much cleaner, more beautiful, and amazing than Malibu's. Cool places to hang out nearby, whether it's for breakfast, lunch, dinner, shopping, strolling, people watching.

One member visualized a new life of living here and mastering surfing. There were boards carried around town and on beachfront.Dogs were not welcome on the beach and the beach was better and worse for it. It was missing frisbee dogs.Unique atmosphere for a day at the beach.

50,Great beach,"We visited here at a weekend, when there was a beach volleyball tournament on. We were surprised that there weren't more people around to be honest. Apart from the crowds around the volleyball, the beaches weren't that crowded. This is such a nice beach I don't understand why more people don't get down there at the weekend? I don't know why i'm complaining, it meant we had a real nice relaxing walk along the beach, managed to snap a few freebies from the stalls even though we weren't watching the volleyball, and met some really friendly locals. The neighbourhood seems really nice, clean and has some interesting buildings. We'd definitely visit again if we are ever that way again - which i doubt because there's no way you'll ever find me navigating our way through LA traffic again. Would be my worse nightmare. Shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoyo237
50,My Favorite Beach,I love this pier. Its a clean beach. There are shops all around and places to get food. It has a good energy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chassidyl2014
50,Stunning,After visiting the rather hectic Santa Monica Pier the day before my 14 year old daughter and I decided to check out Manhattan Beach. We got many recommendations to go to this place and we're glad we did.When we arrived on Manhattan Beach Blvd. the view was amazing. We walked out on the pier and watched the surfers catching the small waves as the crashed in. At the end of the pier is a free aquarium that looked very nice. Unfortunately it was closed when we were there. The views from the pier are amazing.We then decided to go down to the beach. The first impression was how soft the sand was. It actually felt soothing on my feet. We walked under the pier and along the beach for a mile or so before turning around. The people there were all full of smiles and friendly hellos.I haven't experienced many beaches in California but this one is on the top of the list so far.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skipper1467

It's a very active beach with lots of sand volleyball, biking, walking, swimming, etc. I especially love biking ""the Strand"" --the paved path that runs from Marina del Rey through Manhattan Beach & ends up in Redondo Beach (roughly 28 miles round trip). A great way to experience the active SoCal lifestyle while taking in the beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean, as well as the beautiful homes along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresaw

50,Best beach town in Southern California!,"LA leaves a lot to be desired--some nice communities, some terrible communities.

50,"Nice beach, awesome city",Very nice city close to LA but not so busy and turbulent. Great beach community to stay with the family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AQuadra
40,Lovely beach,Love going to Manhatton beach to walk along the prom into Hermossa beach .Get a beer in the Deck on the front then walk back into Manhatton beach.Love people watching and the beach volley ball and just bikes skateboards whizzing along.It's also nice to look at the houses along the promenade that you can't afford.Quaint shops and pubs and restaurants make it a nice town only downside is it's a hill down to the beach . Not so good going back up if you are not fit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surfsup2
50,CA treasure,"This is one of southern California's best beaches.It's a very deep beach that's well maintained.The beach is always filled with active people. Beach goers, broad-walk walkers, sand volleyball games, and swimmers. Great beach to relax at the water. Lots of coffee shops, bars,and restaurants within a block of the beach. Only downfall is in the height of the day parking close to the beach can be rare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJNinAZ
50,Great family area - something for everyone,"One of the striking things about walking the strand is how friendly everyone is. Very easy to strike up a conversation and have a pleasant run, walk or day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobM951
10,Tourist trap,This is the bar bill for two yes two glasses of wine. Not to mention I really wanted enjoy the pool today but it was filled with at least 30 children. If you're looking for reasonable relaxing place to stay this is definitely not what you want I used to like it here. So disappointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838oriec
40,Very pictueresque,Well worth a visit to get away from LA. Only a 40 minute drive to experience a much more laid back feel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chasingplanes
40,Lunch break Visit.,"Good environment. Full of activities - from jogging, skate boarding, to beach side lottery. There were a few places to stand and watch. Boat rides were available. Couldn't participate on activities since I hadn't enough time, being on business lunch break. There are very many eating houses in the neighborhood. A nice place to visit. Surely, recommended for individual and group day visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sir_AE

50,Very relaxing walk/bike trail along the beach!,We stopped here on the way from LA as we were heading down the coast to San Diego. It's wasn't too crowded and the architecture of the houses lined up by the pavement on the beach were each very different and interesting. Great place to walk the dog or go for a relaxing stroll. There are a few places to get coffee near the beach as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193moniquecs
50,One of California's finest Beach cities. Much to do,"Manhattan Beach is one of the many beach cities that make HWY 1 spectacular during the summer months in CA.

40,Lots of space to enjoy,"Manhattan beach is huge. There are plenty of permanent beach-volleyball nets available, public bathrooms, ocean breeze and waves to play in and surf on. Take a walk on the Manhattan Pier and watch fishermen trying to catch a fish. There are some benches to sit on if you want to stay on the pier to take in the view for an extended period of time. We saw dolphins jumping not too far off shore. People of all ages and combinations were enjoying the beach. We liked walking along the beach in the waves. We also really liked walking along the pathway in front of the row of houses, knowing that most of them are valued at more than 10 million dollars each, wondering who lives there and what their lives are like. If you need shade, you'll need to bring your own umbrella - there are no cabanas or umbrellas. Bring a picnic lunch and plenty of water. Don't forget the sunscreen or you'll get a sunburn: sun really beats down here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moochie-La-La
40,An excellent layover option,"If you want a better option to spend 6 hours doing something other than sitting at LAX waiting for your connecting flight, consider this. Rent a car, take a 15 minute drive to Manhattan Beach! This is a cute little town with wonderful options for eating. Walking through the hilly streets can lead you to the sand. Activities of volleyball, jogging, surfing and people watching surround you. The refreshing pacific scene will revive you on your journey. Drive off with a smile....and a full tummy! This town is A highly recommended jaunt without hesitation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islandtimes4
50,"Beautiful, clean, family oriented",This beach is absolutely breathtaking. It has a family filled atmosphere. Also: there are volleyball nets if you're interested in playing. Check out the beach at sunset - indescribable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missbeccaBSNRN

50,So much fun to be had!,I was doing a cross country road trip. Manhattan Beach was one of my favorite stops. Tons of shopping and restaurants/bars within walking distance of each other. Add a dash of volleyball history and it's a great place to visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7411OWshawnc
30,Quite a nice beach,The shopping centre at Manhattan beach was of a reasonable standard but nothing really to write home about. The each itself has some great sandy areas but much of the beach is taken up with hundreds of beach volleyball courts. The day we are there was mild with some swimmers and quite a lot of surfers but being midweek probably meant that we did not see the crowds Good lifesaving spots for swimming so overall a nice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennyhall1944
40,Looking for sun and fun! Found both in Manhattan Beach,"This is a great beach town experience, especially if you want to stay near the airport.

50,Neat and Vast,The crazy number of surfers and beach volley enthusiasts throng this place at lot. but it is a lovely sight to see some much happening. the cafe at the pier is a must visit. good spot to visit if you have a layover at LAX (that is how i visited this place).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaurmayank
50,Best So Bay Beach town,"Fun little beachside town.Easy taxi ride from LAX if you have a stopover.Beautiful white sand beach, great shops and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slau220
40,Over Night Trip,"This beach is one of the least crowded as well as one of the cleanest California beaches that I've visited. I'd say it has More shops & Restaurants than Morro Bay & Pismo although they do seem like higher end shops & boutiques so they may be a bit pricier than the average. Oh! the hill you have to walk up to get to them from the pier is a little work out. If your out of shape, pushing a stroller or a wheel chair just drive it's much easier and enjoyable. Surprisingly it seems like it could possibly have a decent yet, low key night life. The beach has a long concrete board walk which for a family with smaller children (stroller) that is ideal & more practical. The only down sides to the beach is that we had to use port-a-potties which is no fun and pretty disgusting with small children, no easy access showers, we had to ask the life guard & had a hard time finding one as it was hidden & in the sand which makes it pretty pointless, also that the 2 parking lots closest to the pier are extremely extremely small....good luck finding a parking. Over all we had a good time because everyone knows when you go to the beach you should expect to take a little bit of it home with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrndz09
50,You won't be disappointed at Manhattan Beach,"I love ALL beaches, but Manhattan Beach has terrific energy and excitement! The sand is beautiful and pristine, and the water is so clear, you can see the bottom of the Ocean. I love the watching the waves and the people, who are so very nice.

Lots of picture perfect opportunity for photographs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lailiah

40,Beach activities,"Beach was pretty chilly for late-May (maybe in high 60s) but then again Bish I'm from Louisiana and not used to the wind chill. I was surprised at how many people were in the water and how many different activities they had going on. Surfing, paddle boarding, drone flying, wind sailing/surfing. If you can stand cooler waters I definitely suggest hanging out around the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCLOS
40,"Great beach, bad parking","Manhattan Beach is great. Volleyball courts, bike paths, beautiful sand, and lots of space. Parking super close can be a bear, but other than that, it's great!! Highly recommend if you are visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robonski

40,Manhattan Beach,"One of the more overlooked places in or around Los Angeles, Manhattan Beach was one of my favorite parts of my trip to LA. It's much quieter than your more famous places such as Santa Monica or Hollywood.If you're looking to ""be a tourist"" this may not be the ideal place for you, but it certainly is worth taking a couple hours of your day and making the trip. The majority of the attractions are located near the boardwalk. Some of the hotels near LAX offer a $5 round-trip shuttle ride to Manhattan Beach.This beach has one of the better sunset views and is very clean. The pier has a (very) small aquarium, which is good for kids to pop in. This aquarium is free, but they suggest making a donation for admission.For those looking for a place to get a few drinks, I highly recommend a bar called Downstairs. It doesn't look like much and is pretty small, but the atmosphere, staff and fellow patrons are pleasant to be around.Old Venice Greek restaurant was a good place to eat. I recommend the Gyro Sliders.Needless to say, my next trip to LA will certainly include another visit to Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAGuy4465

The weather was nice, a bit warm but overall fine.I would rather sleep but who can sleep when you are with kids.We headed for the beach, took a spot on the pier parking for public, got our gear, and headed for the waters!Being a fine afternoon, it seemed most people had the same idea, being a Friday, and so there was a crowd but just enough to give a sense of busyness, restaurants had a fill of customers, and the beach crowd was just right.The beach offers us who have worked hard during the week a sense of serenity and relaxation. It can be a place to regain your sanity from the demands of the week.The place is clean! Bring a folding chair and relax!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hexelspixels
50,One of the cleanest places in the South Bay,"YES, Manhattan Beach is among the priciest real estate on the CA coast. It is also among the safest, but keep in mind that crime has no boundaries, and does happen everywhere. So don't be mistaken: there is no such place as ""crime free"". That being said, Manhattan Beach is beautiful, and has many unique and interesting shops. It also has one of THE BEST restaurants, never disappointing; I live 3 miles inland,My grandparents moved there in the 1930's, my entire family has lived nearby for generations...and as long as The Kettle has been in Manhattan Beach, we have gone there! Delicious food with good healthy CA style options, about 3 blocks uphill from the ocean,so sitting outside on the patio affords a beautiful view! In winter, the patio becomes closed in with outdoor heaters, so you don't have to miss a thing! Manhattan Beach, and The Kettle...'Must Do's' if you are in the area. P.S. be advised that parking can be difficult, depending on time and if there are any events taking place. Also, Manhattan Beach is a NON-SMOKING city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulapI6380WN

50,California dreaming,"Manhattan Beach is 20min driving from the International Airport of Los Angeles. It's very easy to access through Ocean Drive without entering in Los Angeles. Even if it is so close to L.A. it is a wonderful, peace oasis. There are all the iconic elements of a Californian beach town: the pier, the beach, the beach-volley fields, the waves and obviously the surfers. But in comparison with the more famous Venice Beach or Santa Monica it is not crowded with tourists and with souvenir's shops. There are nice boutiques, high level restaurants but overall there is the feeling of a small, nice, rich town. Sunsets are breathtaking. Parking is quite easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi

50,Volleyball lover's dream beach!,"I love Manhattan Beach. Especially The Strand. The paved boardwalk is especially nice because there is one for walkers/runners and a separate one for bikers. The waves here are especially big, surfers like it, but could be a danger also. There are many restaurants and shops up and down the streets around the beach. We especially like Lemonade and the ice cream sweet shop on the corner. There are tons of sand volleyball courts. Beach is wide with great sand and minimal debris. A great way to spend a day or stop on your way to LAX.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshendri

50,A beautiful beach in or out of the water,"My husband and I are Manhattanites living just a few blocks from the ocean. We never tire of our daily walks down to the ocean. We have the widest beach in California. (great for volleyball, sand castles, and sun bathing). In fact we have so much sand that we once sold a bunch of it to Hawaii! The Strand, which borders the beach, has two sections, a long uninterrupted pedestrian sidewalk which is great for running and walking, and a separate path just for cyclists. The pier is picturesque and a great place for dolphin sightings. Aside from all that, just a couple of blocks from the beach you'll find a cluster of cute restaurants as well as individually owned shops. This is truly a great place to visit and an even greater place for living!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/innfan2013
40,Upscale part of Southern California,"We are touring the US in our motorhome, and a few days ago we found ourself looking up relatives who live in Manhattan Beach. So much of the Los Angeles area is dirty, run-down and covered in graffiti that it is refreshing to find a section that is just the opposite.We walked out to the end of the pier where a low-budget (and free) aquarium is at. It is also a great spot to watch the surfers trying to catch a wave. An hour earlier from the porch of our relatives place, we spotted a whale spouting, ""periscoping"" and jumping out of the water - what a great sight! The surrounding area is full of beautiful homes, and plenty of nearby shops and restaurants. Parking can be a bit of a challenge (and you need to be able to parallel park), but we managed.Overall, we had a very nice day here. It looked like a great oceanside community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coffeetime69

50,A must visit.....,"As I finish my run today, I look at the pier and the blue ocean and I think...if I had one day here what would I do?I gess I would start at Uncle Bills for breakfast and get the lay of the land. Noah'sBagels is another local spot. Once coffee-d up and well fed, I would head to the beach. Maybe grab a sandwich from Beckers or wander up to Ercoles at noon for a burger. Enjoy that beach is the mail thing.After the beach, I would head to the Strand House for the view and a spicy margarita. The view wins at the downstairs bar. Now it's time for dinner and you have lots of choices. But your new local friends will tell you Fonz's is the way to go. Danny and his team will make you feel like getting a realtor and moving.Lastly, the end of the night has to to Shellback. Next to the pier and locals are the people to watch and talk to. Then....off to the end of the pier and look back at the town and know that tomorrow....you get to do it all over again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peterisacksen

There are so many cute (but pricey) shops and restaurants with great menus.The beach itself reminded me more of San Diego's Mission Beach. There is a nice path for walking or bike riding that goes along the beach.

The pier is an excellent place to watch people try to catch some waves. The area was very well kept, clean, and free of vagrants - that I could see.Walking along the beach made me want to move here but probably can't afford.

40,Forgotten Beach on Scenic Highway 1,"This beach is not as well known as others along the LA coast road, however, it is a real gem. The next beach along to the north of Manhattan beach is a fairly dodgy industrial looking area (as you do find in LA you never know what's around the corner) but this beach is surrounded by affluent houses built close together, backyards spill down to the walk way behind the beach and the actual pier and beach themselves are pristine. It is a great way to spend the afternoon if you are waiting on a flight out to Australia late in the evening as we were. The locals are friendly there are a multitude of different restaurants of every type and pubs are filled with a great atmosphere. If you are looking for a good clean beach and good food you should go take a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazzyvege
50,All Around Wonderful,"In February, we rent a one bedroom condo (with garage parking) on Manhattan Beach so we could experience the place like a local. We loved waking up and being able to walk just a block and half to the beach.It was also very enjoyable to walk along the Strand. I loved seeing the lovely home on one side and the beach on the other.Things to know:-- We had perfect weather in February, but be prepared with layered clothing.-- Comfortable shoes is a must so you can enjoy walking along the strand, and up and down the hilly neighborhood.-- Taxis are not necessarily easy to find. If you plan on leaving the Manhattan Beach, or if you're staying a littler farther from the Manhattan Beach Pier area, consider how you will get around--whether that's walking, biking or driving.Place to eat or experience:We ate at the Kettle, the Strand House and OB's Bar and Grill. We also went to the Manhattan Beach Creamery and had yummy chocolate covered Oreos.One night, we went to the Comedy and Magic Club (where Jay Leno makes an occasional appearance) at Hermosa Beach. The night we were there, 10 comedians were on the line-up. It was a very fun evening. Also, it was a very easy drive to get to there from Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCLinSTL

50,Early check out but late flight at LAX: RENT A CAR and drive to Manhatten Beach,"After a weekend in Venice Beach, my friend and I had about 5hrs before we had to be at LAX. With luggage in tow, we weren't about to drag it to the beach or leave it anywhere alone in Venice Beach. So we took Uber to the airport and rented a car from Enterprise for $20. We figured way cheaper than taking Uber to different places all day and dragging luggage in and out of cars. Enterprise has fantastic staff, self serve kiosks and quick pick cars of your choosing. We were in and out of there in less than 15 minutes and on our way to Manhattan Beach to enjoy our last few hours on the coast. Great plan if you have some time to kill. MB is very quick and convenient to LAX - however this was a Sunday and traffic is much lighter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kweedman

It definitely has the most energy out of the beaches just south of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentley2828
50,Wonderful Place to Walk or Bike,"We rented a home on Manhattan Beach (note: City Council recently passed a ban on vacation rentals, revoking the permit of everyone, including the family we rented from--but you can still rent in Hermosa Beach, also on The Strand). Manhattan Beach has a fantastic beachfront wide walkway and a separate bike path. Both run for miles along the Pacific. The beach is immaculate. Early each morning crews clean and rake the beach. Since smoking is banned everywhere in public in Manhattan Beach, the beach is clean even when fully occupied. Beware, however, people who fish from the pier attract small sharks that at times swim toward those taking surf lessons! This was our second trip to Manhattan Beach, and would have been an annual vacation except for the arrogant decision by council members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayZee1313
50,"Sand, Sun & Fun","The beach here has lots of clean, powdery sand as far as you can see. It is thankfully the opposite of the Santa Monica pier - a classy, family place that has good restaurants and shops but has not marched down the path of tacky beach tourism.TIP: Check the schedule as their are often events.

Bit of an upscale area I'm told.I stayed nearby on the Pacific Coast Highway and Manhattan was my nearest nice place to walk, coffee and generally hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craiginsydney
50,California Dreamin',Manhattan Beach along the Strand has all the California beach vibe. A bike and pedestrian walkway parallels the beach at the sand (mostly). Restaurants from cheap to excellent are scattered in the nearby communities. The surfers and beach volleyball people are out parts of every day. Street festivals appear from time to time .. which can be interesting but make parking a problem. The view is terrific.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PVtalker
50,Dolphins were active the day we visited,"We went on a weekday (Wednesday) around 3pm - we were able to find parking in the public lots that had 5 hour meters that accepted credit card payment. If you're flying into LA be sure to pack a few beach towels and collapsible coolers in your luggage. Since we flew for our trip we didn't have an umbrella or chairs for the beach - sunglasses, hats, sunblock a must - no refuge from the sun available. The weather was beautiful and we were lucky enough to witness a few active dolphins jumping around just past the swimming area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyF89

40,check the schedule,"This beach hosts volleyball tournaments so could easily be a nightmare. It is more of a local beach compared to say Newport. Good is that it is way less crowded and people are more polite. We actually had space around us. Parking close by is a disaster, plan on walking downhill 2 blocks. There is a decent selection of restaurants for lunch. It is also a downhill walk across a lot of sand to the water. The water was clean and warm, fairly strong breakers and current. Enjoyed boogie boarding and watching surfers near the pier. Saw only 1 place to rent equipment. We definitely enjoyed the local flavor and less crowded experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaylordm
40,A sunny afternoon in Manhattan Beach.,"Although the property values here are mindblowing to this North Carolina girl, the beach and town are still low-key and charming with a small town, beach vibe. Chi-chi boutiques and restaurants together with village coffee shops and everyday small town businesses, small cottages together with incredibly huge, renovated seafront mansions. Small lanes and narrow steep streets to the beachfront, brilliant bougainvillea, lilies, geraniums, succulents and grasses. Kids with surfboards, toddlers and chic twentysomethings. Apart from the awful gridlock of traffic, this is a wonderful taste of the glamor of seaside LA life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452jilliang
40,Nice beach but...,"It's a nice beach but getting parking is almost impossible. We spent 1hour looking for one.

Twenty minutes out of LAX & we were sitting on the golden sand looking out to the Pacific for the last time of our trip. And it was magical. The pier was bustling with life and the restaurants were all serving delicious seafood.

You can cover a lot of ground and see other beach towns like Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMeat9
40,Beautiful,"My daughter took us to this beach area. It was absolutely beautiful. The beach was spotless and it was fun to watch the surfers ride the waves. My children rented bikes and road all along the path down to Hermosa beach. The homes were stunning overlooking the ocean and it was fairly inexpensive to rent ( $8 per hour). There are also many places to eat and drink if you decided to walk in to the town. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is for the parking. Get there early to find street parking which mostly had a 2 hour limit on the meters. Also drive around through the neighborhoods up the hills, the view is amazing and so are the homes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dm670
50,Rent a bike for a ride on the beach,Manhattan beach is a fantastic bike ride on a great paved path that's over 40 miles if you start at Hermosa Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelvan
50,Metered or free parking,"Very nice clean ""alcoholfree"" long stretch of beach with regular lifeguard posts. There is metered parking in the streets and also straight at the beach, the latter however very few places. I parked for free in the end in Marina street about 500 yards from the beach, a sturdy little walk up a hill. There are both a walking path and a lower bicycle path immediately at the beach side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes_NL
50,"Beautiful View, Stunning Sunsets, Quiet Beach","Are you looking for a beach that is not packed with people? Manhattan Beach is a unknown gem! It's beautiful, has stunning sunsets and although people are there it is not packed like the other beaches up by Venice and Santa Monica. The town is great, lots of great restaurants and shops. Beach has a lot of open space, great pier, and stunning views. Can walk for miles along the water's edge. Right on the bike trail as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelteach92
40,Spend a nice afternoon or evening here,"My sister and I spend a night in LA if we're going to Australia or Fiji and we use our day to have some fun not far from the airport. Manhattan Beach even has a bus (can't remember is it's free or just really cheap) that runs from the area of the airport hotels to Manhattan Beach so you can go there inexpensively. There are good restaurants, fun shopping, a huge beach and a nice pier so it's a lovely place to while away a few hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayMarco
40,Great leisure place to have a lunch,"If you are beach lover, Manhattan Beach has to be on your list when you visit LA. We were on our way to Palos Verdes to visit some friends and stopped by Manhattan Beach for a relaxing lunch. The beach as well as its surrounding areas were beautiful, well maintained and quite peaceful. After lunch, as we walked along the sidewalk we noticed some locals hanging out at the pier and playing volleyball. All in all we enjoyed this beach and had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164jc

50,Best place for a family beach vacation,"Having lived in a few parts of LA, Manhattan Beach is definitely my favorite destination for a family vacation. The beaches are clean as well as the town. There are numerous restaurants, parks, a library and shopping all in walking distance from the center of town. It's very safe and family friendly compared to other parts of LA county.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciafR5274KX
40,Beautiful beach,"The beach is beautiful. Lots of volleyball, bike riding & surfing. The beach isn't too busy so I really enjoyed having space. I did come across one or two tar balls leftover from the spill in Santa Barbara but it was few enough to not cause alarm. There are a few great white sharks living in the area....something to be aware of if you swim further out or go surfing. The locals are pretty used to them and don't seem to get concerned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9006UAsarahc
50,visit Manhattan Beach,"if you're in LA and site seeing, one of your beach stops HAS to be the famous Manhattan Beach.

There were a couple of visitors that were enjoying from the bridge in wheelchairs as well as couples and families.Lone readers on the beach sat under umbrellas and enjoyed the afternoon also. There was a concession stand on the upper deck with food and drinks. We took off our shoes and walked barefoot in the sand (be careful doing this as a couple of us got tar on our feet). It was family friendly and fun for an afternoon in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaCharleen
50,Great Beach!,"This beach was a very nice place to visit. The view of the ocean, the pier to walk on. You can drive along up or down the coast to wherever you're headed.

40,"A long, wide beach makes for people watching","Manhattan is a long and wide beach that is very, very popular. We were there on July 3rd and walked out the pier to the aquarium. It wasn't sunny but the holiday made it incredibly crowded. For some people, this may be the ideal setting, but for our tastes, there were far too many people to make it a relaxing trip. A pathway runs adjacent to the beach and it was relatively uncrowded. The water was fairly clean and warm, and small waves made for tepid surfing. Near the pier are many reasonably priced restaurants. Folks also are friendly in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mingfatsai
50,Iconic Californian beach experience,"Ocean, pier, beautiful people, lifestyles of the rich and famous and some beautiful looking doggies enjoying the sunshine. Glad we came to experience it. Lunch at the Fish Bar to top it off. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clared631

50,The Best of the Best,I have lived in Manhattan Beach for 30 plus years and plan to continue to live here. Why? Because Manhattan Beach meets the needs of every age group. It was wonderful to enjoy the beach before I had children. Then when I had children it was fun to take our children to the beach to teach them how to swim and enjoy nature. Now that our children are grown the community provides activities for Senior citizens. Manhattan Beach is the Best of the Best!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbj55

The beach is usually not crowded (except during the surf competition and Manhattan Beach open volleyball tournaments held in August) and is generally quite clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalic413
30,Tar on the sand,"This is a nice beach close to LAX which is good for travelers. Unfortunately, after walking the beach we discovered that our feet were covered in tar! It is very hard to get off and I ruined several hotel towels trying. I suspect it comes from the oil tankers or rigs offshore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/movalgirl
40,Perfect Winter Getaway,"This beach town was a perfect place to make our home base for our SoCal vacation. We loved runs along the strand, surfing El Porto and grabbing dinner downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMoney02043
40,Nice Beach and unusual niche community,Manhattan Beach is a young vibrant area. Lots of restaurants of every variety. Cute boutiques for women and several spa/salons on the strip. The hills are steep so the demographics are young. Great place to visit for short time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dia1952
30,"pretty, but I'll stay somewhere else next time I come to Cali","Town is quiet and pretty clean. Beach is cold and no shells, but also big and clean. Not easy to get around if you don't have a car. Hotel had transport to and from LAX. Mall has mostly women's stores. With 2 teens- they are bored. I didn't want crazy, but. I didn't want this either for our visit. Last day here we walked 6 miles on the beach and went back to hotel pool. Went out to eat at 5 and were in room by 630 watching TV....teens need more options, so if you are considering it for Teens and you aren't going anywhere but here- make new plans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMcNala

40,"Most interesting Architecture, beach and broadwalk","This place is very American and a fun place to explore.

50,One of the Three South Bay Beach Cities,"All three have a slightly different vibe. MB has surfers, but it's not a surfers' town. It's a mini-Westside of LA town without all the congestion and at the ocean with a gorgeous beach. This is where you see a lot of 'beautiful people' spending money and eating well. Yes, of course it's SoCal casual, but it's not the place for beach grunge drinking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chascal
50,Beautiful,"This is a great beach. Our friends had lots of fun playing in the water near a couple of dolphins that decided to swim by. Cool! Beach was quiet, calm and very enjoyable.

50,Fantastic place to relax,"By far the best beach area in the main Los Angeles area. The beach is long and wide. Sand is great. Beach volleyball nets everywhere. The ocean is perfect along this stretch - just enough surf to make it interesting. Strolling the beach, watching the volleyball players and a few surfers, is a fun way to spend an afternoon. Also, strolling the sidewalk along the top of the beach, one gets a great view of the fantastic beach houses lining the shore.The town area just above the beach is very nice - lots of restaurants and shops. Sure, it's a bit touristy, but not garish like some other areas in the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our days there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwg51357

30,"Nice beach, but lots of black tar","We really enjoyed Manhattan Beach during our recent trip to the L.A. area. The surf was nice and even which allowed my daughters to develop a comfort level in the water without random waves wiping them out. We visited the beach twice during our week in the area.It’s beautiful and sits right on the strand, but there are fewer shops and tourists here than in some of the other spots like Santa Monica, Venice and Hermosa and it wasn’t crowded at all either time we went (though that may have been due to lower than normal temperatures). There were lots of volleyball courts and several of the locals were surfing. Parking was easy and reasonably priced right at the beach – though there wasn’t a lot of it. We have family that live in the area and this is their favorite beach for recreation.I mark this beach down a bit because of the tar in the water and sand. This was the only beach we visited during the week that had this issue, but the first time we visited my daughter ruined a swimsuit because of tar stuck to it. The second time we visited my wife got it stuck on her feet. Not much you can do about it, but again, this was the only place we had this issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Need2TravelMuchMore
10,LOCALS LOOK LIKE BEACH TRASH,"This place sucks. It is full of tourists and snobby locals. You should not go to manhattan beach unless you want to be surrounded by the ""beach trash "" locals and rich kooks that call this place home. Save your time and money and goto Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8269BDjohnd
50,Fun and Friendly,"Having lived here for over 40 years, I have enjoyed what our town has to offer. It is bordered by the beautiful Pacific Ocean and a beach that is large and inviting. There is surfing, swimming, volleyball, walking on the pier, and even an aquarium to enjoy at the beach. Restaurants are upscale or down to earth - your choice. There are a variety of shopping opportunities both downtown and at the mall. We have great parks to enjoy and a walking trail as well as a bike path on the beach. So, relax or get out and exercise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathien74
40,Pier Pressure,"Obviously the little brother to Santa Monica pier, however what it lacks in stature it gains in being casual and uncrowded. From this pier there was room to sit and ponder, great views of Manhattan neighbourhood without being shadowed by hotel chains and traffic jams.Manhattan beach has a wide expanse of sand and numerous volley ball nets ready for players. Beaches were flagged and patrolled. Paid parking was available. As this visit was in spring break there were only some brave enough to swim, given that the water temperature is still cool in April. Lovely and warm to enjoy sitting in the sunshine and look at the ocean. Good walkways provided and separate cycle tracks. Handy access to Manhattan retail and restaurant precint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heritage255068
50,Beautiful beach,"I'm used to the warm beaches of Florida, the Bahamas, and Caribbean; as such, a few of the beaches we went to in Southern California were too cold for me to handle. However, Manhattan Beach was warm enough. The walk along the pier is worth doing, and offers great photo-taking opportunities of the surrounding landscape. Parking is really difficult to find sometimes; it took us over 30 minutes to find a spot. Even so, it's a really popular beach, and for good reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415tylerm
50,Nice stroll,The walkway along the houses that line the beach is terrific. It's nice and wide and clean. The beach itself is nice and wide and clean. We ended up walking 5 miles and enjoying every inch of the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525christians
50,Volleyball capital with nice pier,We arrived at Manhattan Beach using the hotel shuttle. We walked to the end of the pier and enjoyed the warm 75 degrees weather. Saw the aquarium with the different ells and fish. Saw a bulldog skate boarding!! Walked down to the water and it was cold but the surfers were out with wet suites on and there was a photog out in the water taking pictures of some of the surfers. The beach is very wide with brown rough sand and people were sunbathing and having picnics with their families. We watched a volleyball game. There are a lot of nets set up all along the beach. No dogs allowed on the beach. We strolled the boardwalk and admired the beautiful houses along the waterfront. Looked in the clothing stores and grocery shops. Stopped for a gellato. I had the gelladough( warm donut with gellato and fruit in the middle) Had lunch at Manhattan Pizza. We came to Manhattan Beach twice. A lovely place to spend a day.Blueses1492,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blueses1492
50,This place is hopping,We were in town for a day. Decided to hang out in Manhattan Beach. It was a beautiful Sunday in LA and the beach was hopping. We found the town very neat for lack of a better word. Seemed to be a younger crowd (20s and 30s). Must have been the weather. All the shops and restaurants were packed. Beach was clean and more than spacious enough given the crowd. Everything was clean. The homes along the beach add a special element. Really recommend the town and the beach itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KachellaKing
50,Just What the Doctor Ordered: Peace,Started off every day on the beach. Ended every evening on the beach.

40,Close to hotel,Been to this beach 2 times last time visit I can't enjoy scenery because too windy but yesterday I really enjoy the beach...so nice and not so many people's. Actually Manhattan beach only 11 minutes drive from our hotel. We stayed at double tree Hilton around El Segundo so it's only short drive.

40,nice beach and pier,"We went for a quick visit as it was close to the hotel and LAX airport. there's a long pier with a tiny aquarium and lots of parking i think it was $2 per hr. It was petty quiet but i think thats because it was low season. Lots of people surfing ! Enough space on the sand to sit where you want. Toilets available. Really close to the main street and shops/bars. you could stay for much longer if you had kids to amuse, but we were just there for a short while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katie780
30,"Lovely beach, apart from the oil","Manhattan Beach is a lovely little place to visit. The beach is garbage free, although my friend ended up with a clod of oil on her foot which was very difficult to remove but she managed using sand to scrub it off and some of my anti-bacterial wipes. That kind of shattered the illusion of an idyllic seaside stroll!That said, there's an old pier to watch the surfers from, plenty of little shops and bars and restaurants. Enough to keep you occupied for a few hours at least.We enjoyed wandering around somewhere new and the people watching was good too.Would I return? No, I think I'd give Venice Beach a try on my next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keebab
50,Lovely quiet beach,"We found this beach on our last day filling time on the way back to LAX airport which is just 15 minutes away. It's small and stylish and wasn't crowded. There were lifeguards on duty. The only warning is that one person in the family found black oil on their foot which was hard to shift, this wasn't obvious on the beach so probably just unfortunate. You would never know you were so close to the airport! Lots of places to eat & have a drink, and looked quite upmarket. Cheap parking on meters. Nice little Pier with a free (small) aquarium on the end - bit tatty but gave 10 mins entertainment and you could stroke a starfish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotties00

40,A walk by the water,"Manhattan Beach is a short drive from LA, a cute little town with a lot of shops as well as a good selection of places to eat. I like to walk along the ocean past all the houses. Deafly worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
20,The Beach and Water is contaminated,"I just spent 3 days at Manhattan Beach and went into the very clear nice looking Ocean to Body Surf and swim. When I came out of the water ""my feet were caked with oil"" as was my friends,They were literally black and it will not come off with normal cleaning after 3 days. My tennis shoes are ruined, it really angers me that this has happen. I am not some liberal environmentalisthowever I might become one over this. It is obvious to me that those big ships anchored off shoreare responsible.Good Bye Manhattan Beach Hello any beach south of these oil stained waters.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmogie1
50,Gorgeous!,"This beautiful expanse of California coastline and a pier was a wonderful side trip. I was able to buy a $5 bus ticket good for the whole day at my hotel. The bus picked me up right out front and stopped at the beach and then at two outdoor malls before returning to the hotel. It's a hop on, hop off system that runs hourly. The beach was wonderful and the little village had lots of shops and restaurants. There's a lovely ice cream store that had wonderful ice cream, perfect for a hot day, It wasn't crowded and the locals were friendly and helpful. I would go again in a heartbeat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelainial

50,I live here - I love it,"MB is such a wonderful and amazing town. There are great restaurants, a lovely downtown area, a fantastic beach, an amazing pier, and lively nightlife. Parking is the downside - quite difficult especially during the summer months. The answer is using Uber to deliver you and take you home. The vibe is young and lively. There are also 'old school' bars like Shellback and Ercoles which are not 'trendy' but really local and FUN. There is something for everyone here but hey, don't pass the word. We locals want to keep it under wraps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndiMom
50,Love the City as a Neighbor,"We live in Hermosa Beach which is directly south of the west side of Manhattan Beach. We like going there when our little town doesn't have something that they have. They have a hair dresser that my wife loves and a shopping area far bigger than ours which includes a Target, Macy's, two Trader Joe's, Old Navy, REI, and many more.Manhattan Beach also has a high school that Hermosa kids can attend if they choose. The western part of the city is a little more upscale than Hermosa and probably has a higher number of doctors and lawyers living there. Hermosa is probably a little younger with more singles. Hermosa seems to be a little more into sports than Manhattan and, since we own our own beach, has more popular events such as craft fairs, beach concerts, and beach sporting events which can easily be arranged without Coastal Commission involvement.There is an eastern part of Manhattan Beach that is much farther inland than Hermosa's eastern boundary. As a result, Manhattan Beach has a larger population.Most visitors can't tell where Manhattan Beach ends and Hermosa Beach begins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomslyck

50,"If you're going to go to a beach town in LA, this should be your 1st choice","I lived in Manhattan Beach for six years back in the '80's. It was great then and still is. I visit here each time I'm in the LA area. Sometimes it's to eat, sometimes to walk the strand or be on the pike path, sometimes to watch a pro volleyball tournament (beach volleyball originated in Manhattan Beach), sometimes just to oogle youngsters in their swimsuits. It's home to many young professionals as well as older and better heeled folks. Homes range from small cottages to virtual mansions on the beach. There's the pier, the shops, the restaurants, and lots of people taking it all in.Because the beach at Manhattan Beach is not a destination for public transportation (at least it didn't used to be), you don't get the crowds flocking to it from other parts of Los Angeles. (The busses go to Santa Monica or Redondo Beach) And as another reviewer stated, you can get here from the airport very quickly. Really no excuse not to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/391waynew

50,Great Southern California Beach Community,"Manhattan Beach is a fun beach community filled with good restaurants, fun boutiques and great outdoor activities from surfing to riding bikes along a lovely seaview path. It can be a challenge to find parking on busy weekends. We are usually able to snag a metered parking spot after hunting for a short while. Check the local newspaper, The Beach Reporter, for fun activities in the area. Celebrity watchers may like to know that many athletes and people in the entertainment industry own homes along The Strand, the ribbon of homes along the beachfront.

50,So you want to visit our town,"Visiting Manhattan Beach? Locals from other towns including Hermosa Beach, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach will disagree, but Manhattan Beach is the greatest beach town in Southern California.and honestly. Here's what you want to do:1. Go to the pier and visit the Roundhouse Aquarium at the end.2. Take a picture of the sunset--just don't stand in the middle of the Manhattan Beach Boulevard for your selfie. Amazing how many people try that stunt.3. Actually go to the beach. Sand is great and there is lots of it available. Warning water can be chilly in the winter (that's why we don't get hurricanes like Florida).4. Spend some time downtown, shops are amazing especially if you like boutique women's shops.5. Eat. Amazing restaurants that range from the dive with the great burgers (Shellback's) to the top end places (Beach House, MB Post). Check out the Trip Advisor rankings, most of them are accurate.6. Relax. This isn't Beverly Hills; it's cool to walk around in flip flops and a non-designer t-shirt.7. Walk/jog the wood chip trail. This runs the length of the city and you will see everyone and their dog here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104jamesg

It's a quaint laid back location with lots to keep you interested for hours.Many restaurants looked inviting but The Strand House won us over with their fabulous views.

Beautiful beach, great weather, great shopping and restaurants nearby, outstanding schools, and 15 minutes from LAX without going on the infamous I-405. Most houses, even the multi-million dollar ones, don't need AC with the breeze off Santa Monica Bay every evening. On a weekend night the main street, Manhattan Beach Blvd, is hopping with lots of Baby Boomers, Yuppies, Millennials, and families, enjoying the view, the restaurant and bar scene, and the shopping.

When we visited in December, kids and surfers alike were bobbing along; locals of all ages and tourists from many countries were strolling the shore and walking the pier. The town offers ample parking in a variety of lots with different time limits; most seem to use meters which accept credit cards. On a sunny, 60-degree day, it's hard to top this spot. The beach is conveniently located below a charming, bustling commercial area with countless shops and restaurants; other streets boast stunning homes with spectacular views and lush plantings.

I was very impressed with the Sketchers Company commitment to community events, their flagship store is there and we just enjoyed the Christmas Concert, festival and fireworks.

I don't recall seeing any homeless people hanging around (but we were only here during the daytime). The area is wonderful with a lot of options for restaurants and shopping. Parking wasn't a major issue for us. We found a parallel spot that was metered. There were several other spots available and we were there on a Friday afternoon.

The locals were laughing, walking around and enjoying their own community without a bunch of crazy tourists. The shops are unique and one shop, that sells only cupcakes (I forget its name) was a piece of heaven to find. The beach is expansive, the surf just the right height, and the sunset gorgeous.

I live in South Florida, and after visiting Manhattan Beach, I must say it may be my favorite beach anywhere. It's very wide and long and seems to have something for everyone. Bathers, surfers and fisherman all seemed to have a utopia here. I went for a lovely run along this beach on a wide sidewalk referred to as The Strand. It was a great 5k run with amazing scenary that's sandwiched between the shore line and beautiful beach front abodes.

It was a great place to drop by for dinner and then ogle at the beachfront houses—even at night! There is a little bike path to walk up and down the beach, and you can walk right next to the houses).The restaurants are a bit pricey, but what can be expected. My sister and I might have gotten lucky with parking as well, as it was super easy. Meters run until 9pm.The traffic at around 9:00pm means that you can then hope on Sepulveda to get to the airport—it took us 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alilu007

50,Take the Freeway To A Hidden Paradise!,"We were given directions to Manhattan Beach from one of the sons running San Antonio Winery. Was he right on the money! This hidden gem is just minutes away from LAX. For those who have a layover, late night flight, or time to fill this is a wonderful way to just relax. We had just enough time to walk the beach, see the pier, go to the aquarium, and enjoy a majestic sunset.If you are ""Beach People"" put this on your list to visit. Watching all levels of beach volleyball was an added bonus. The shopping in the town is equally surprising. Make sure you go to the local ice creamery!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrM225
50,wonderfully charming and naturally beautiful,"I never say, ""must see"" but I will now. Just a few miles from the concrete jungle and noise of LAX is wonderfully enticing and relaxing Manhattan Beach. A prefect and convenient respite from hectic travel, indoor air, and bustling people. A couple of hours spent here can totally restore a person's mind, spirit, soul, etc. Easy to get to from LAX and worth the trip from a further location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5545KHamym

50,Absolutely Stunning!!,If you find yourself in California you have to go to manhattan Beach! you get an amazing view from the pier! There is some good shopping stores on the strip there as well but be warned there are some that are quite expensive. the only downfall to the pier is that on some days when you look out you see the oil rigs on the water which kind of kill the view. All in all it is one of the best chilled out places in California,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattyV33

It was very clean, we got lucky with meter parking within a minute walk to the sand. Get there early or you will not find a parking spot for a long time. By the time we left there was a family waiting behind our car that had watched our time count down on the meter. We also saw some black fins swimming through the waves, whether it was sharks or dolphins, the lifeguard was unable to tell us.... scary, but cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChelseaO146

The downtown offers a variety of casual to sophisticated dining options. The beach is spectacular with surfing, swimming and of course beach volleyball. The paved strand provides a great option for biking or walking along the scenic beach. This is a family friendly community, but a terrific option for couples as well. From an afternoon to a two day overnight is perfect. For a romantic getaway and recharge recommend the Shade Hotel with dinner at the Strand House (best sunset view in MB).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4342MKthomasl

40,Relax,Came to relax and we did just that. The beach is wide and you can even get in on a game of beach volley ball. The waves were a bit rough for swimming.

40,Love the beach,"This is a beautiful wide beach, that is clean and full of families. The small area of restaurants near the beach is hopping in the evening. I love the paved pedestrian/bike path. But there is one thing that bothers me. There are two industrial complexes visable from the beach even if a distance from the beach, one to the north and one to the south. At night, they light up the towers. Why did they build these on the coastline? I wish they would go away. Otherwise, it is a nice beach and area.Also, the parking meters take credit cards which is a very good thing. We had a hard time finding parking in Hermosa beach because you need quarters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnS173
50,Great beach!,"It's a clean beach, that's combed daily, and has plenty of lifeguards. Parking was fairly easy to find. There are no restrooms or food/drink kiosks or anything like that - and that's good, keeps it all clean and more organized. If you love hot sand, and big waves - definitely the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Historian20
50,Absolutely Beautiful!,"What a beautiful beach! Lots of people but yet it's so big that you can walk with your love one and feel like you are the only two on the beach. There were summer group of students that were in life guard programs and they were well controlled. No one to worry about. The pier was wonderful to walk on. We saw a shark at the pier while 100 yards away the beach was full of people in the water swimming. Yup, it was scary! The nicest thing is the walk along the beach is concrete and you walk in front of some beautiful homes. It's wonderful to see and then walk right into the main streets of their downtown area which is adjoining. You get to see beautiful shops, eateries and pubs (bars). My favorite by far!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmvizzo

50,Great Beach with fun atmosphere,"Manhattan Beach really is an oasis just south of LAX...I loved the cool restaurants and bars, but especislly the safe, clean, sandy beach...I loved the ability for beginers to catch waves body surfing or boogy boarding on the shore break, or for the more advanced the cooler outer break where the surfers are...catching the smaller waves close to shore is not easy and can be dangerous for the inexperienced as it can result in sand burn on the chest in particula, but here it was so easy to avoid problems and almost gentle...I caught over 200 waves in about 4 hours and only had a minor scrape on one knee.. I then had a massage for $30 at THE SPA at 105 Rosecrans at Highland ave...then picked up my outrageously overpriced laundry at DEBONAIR on Sepulveda( perfect job though, 12 buttons, for suspenders and two folded polos for $62...then sent a package from fed ex at Sepulveda and Arcadia, and then another decent dinner at Fishing with Dynamite...Loved Manhattan Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tourmanager61

We drove around for an hour looking for parking spot. A number of public parking areas were closed for a 'special event'. Impossible to park on the streets. Either meters for 1 or 2 hours or parking for people with resident permits only. The beach looked very pretty from what we could see from the streets. Unfortunately we couldn't visit.We drove further up north. Same great beach, parking and not as busy.

Tons of tar, and we couldn't escape from it. Sneaky, as it isn't outwardly apparent and thus, isn't avoidable. After three days here, we had come to accept that it was inevitable, and it would be on the soles of our shoes and insides of our socks. Could it be from the extensive refinery just next door???

It is pretty much the first beach south of LAX and has a pier with a cafe and small aquarium. There was also plenty of volleyball action there on the south side of the pier. I found a spot north of the pier and enjoyed time in the sun, surf, and got my kite up and over the area with a nice offshore breeze. There is a nice bath house there, a boardwalk and a separate bike path along the beach. Parking is a pain, but I was able to find a spot east and up the hill from the beach on 15th street which was free on Sunday. Mostly, though it is metered parking. The only downside to this beach was that I collected several tar balls on my feet, but with scraping, soap and water they came right off. Yuck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertocollins

50,Great day trip if you are staying at An LAX hotel!,Our friends had told us about Manhattan Beach after they were staying near LAX a few months ago. We flew in from Tahiti arriving before noon and were staying overnight before taking a flight back home to Montreal. The community organizes a shuttle which leaves from several LAX hotels to Manhattan Beach about every hour and costs $5.00 per person for a round trip with unlimited stops. Ask your hotel concierge for a schedule and tickets. The beach is beautiful and there is a lovely pier with a small aquatic museum at the end of it. There are many restaurants and shops nearby and it is easy to spend a few hours strolling and eating. On the way back you can stop at two shopping areas. We actually had dinner at the second before getting back to our hotel around 9:00 pm. We spent a lovely afternoon and evening before flying out the next morning. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReadyToTravelYUL

We daily walk along the Strand and watch the surfers, beach volleyball, and even the frequent dolphin pod as we soak up the sun. It's big enough to easily accommodate the summer crowds, and sometimes has a light cloud or mist in the morning to give a lovely cool start to the day.

The beach is flat for walking and the stuff you see washed up is usually just plastic trash. There's an added bonus of being able top walk on the Strand - a sort of boardwalk above the beach.In the afternoons, on my recent September visit, a lot of kids come down to the beach after school. There are always families and plenty of friendly people.You can walk for miles on the soft sand and occasional patches of tiny mollusk shells, watch folks surfing and playing volleyball.

50,2nd best beach I've ever been to,"2nd best behind Waikiki on Oahu, that is. Whilst in LA my wife & I went to Santa Monica Beach, Venice Beach and Manhattan Beach, and Manhattan was the best of the bunch by a long, long way. It's in a gorgeous area with boutique shops and some amazing seafood restaurants; there's a path for running, walking or biking; and there's relatively cheap metred parking ($1.50 per hour) right on the beach front. The beach itself is gorgeous; not crammed full of people like Santa Monica but also welcoming enough to tourists that you won't feel like you're invading someone else's beach, and the views are astounding.Just a quick note - as you look out at the pier, the left-hand side is a permanent surf area so don't go swimming or even dipping your toes in the ocean or you'll get a (very polite) lifeguard coming over to you. If you want to get your feet wet, do so on the right-hand side instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scruff_UK

50,Beautiful and calm place to be,The drive into the beach was easy and delightful. Parking was hard and a little stressful but all of that went away once we walked on the pier. We enjoyed the little aquarium and coffee shop at the end and then got ready to stick our toes into the sand. The sky wasn't too sunny so I was a little chilly at first but the water was awesome once I eased my way in there. My daughter and I collected rocks and sand dollars and my mother took an up close snapshot of a seagull. We didn't do much activity but there appeared to be quite the set up for volleyball players. This was our first trip to a beach together and it was very soothing and I am looking forward to another trip soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferhlvH
40,"Fabulous Beach, Beach Volleyball, Concerts, Pier and more.......","After a disappointing visit to Santa Monica beach, we spent half-day at the Manhattan Beach, about a 40 minute drive from the LA area - totally worth the traffic and drive.

50,Best Aquarium at the end of the Pier... worth the trip alone,"Manhattan Beach is very pretty, very wide, with beautiful mountain vistas, especially to the north. The beach is filled with volleyball nets, though when I visited, only one net was in use. There appeared to be at least 30 available nets for general usage. The bike path runs through Manhattan Beach and lots of surfers ride waves next the the pier.An unexpected find for me was the incredibly well organized aquarium located at the end of the pier. Walking out, I thought it might be a sandwich shop, but as I walked closer, I could see that it was a community run place, with displays largely by local students. There is much to see in the small space it occupies. Don't miss it!

While the nouveau riche seem to blend seamlessly with the bones that make Manhattan Beach special, thier ""I'm gonna' have mine no matter what"" approach to building, has caused the cost of casually experiencing the area to spiral dizzyingly skyward.

50,Fabulous Manhattan Beach,"I've lived here for 30 years, so I'm a bit biased! We have the cleanest beach around, with all sorts of activities. There are so many restaurants, all of them good. Try The Kettle (a real local's place) or The Ocean View Cafe (fresh healthy food with a fabulous view of the ocean). Dinner out? Try The Fish Bar, Rock 'n Fish, The Tin Roof...again so many from which to choose. Happy Hour? The Fish Bar is always great and there is also Sharkeez (popular with a younger rowdier crowd). Take a walk down the main street because there are quite a few shops, but bring money because nothing is cheap. Starbucks, Peet's Coffee, Coffee Bean...plenty of places to gather. Very safe area with great police. Downsides? Parking can be a problem, and don't forget to bring that money along because you will need it in MB. Wonderful place to visit and an even better place to live!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CABeachTraveler

40,Pleasant surprise and some disappointment,"the busy Labor Day weekend, we had actually planned to visit nearby Hermosa Beach for its ""Fiesta Hermosa"" arts and crafts fair. But we could not find an open parking space anywhere in Hermosa Beach. We ended up driving north to Manhattan Beach, where we felt very lucky to find a metered parking space on the main street. But the meter only allowed a maximum of two hours, and a sign indicated that we would have to move the car after two hours; we couldn't just add more coins and leave it in the same space. We saw police marking tires with chalk, so we took the sign seriously. Walking to the end of the pier, we were pleasantly surprised to discover the Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab & Aquarium, a non-profit facility dedicated to teaching students and visitors about the oceans, marine life, and the environment. It's small and sort of funky, but we were enthralled by the exhibits and impressed by the number of volunteers working there on a holiday. We spent more than 20 minutes of our two-hour parking limit in the aquarium, then left a small donation and went to find a place on the beach. After soaking up the sun, watching a two-on-two volleyball tournament and walking the beach, we had to move the car. I used the men's restroom by the pier, and it was adequate, with sufficient toilet paper and an automatic-flush toilet. But there was no hand soap at the sink, and ""air drying"" was the only way to dry one's hands. Returning to the main street, we noticed a pickup truck leaving another metered space so my wife stood there to hold it while I got the car and re-parked for another two-hour time limit. We had a delicious lunch at Rock'N Fish restaurant, just a few yards from our parking space, then she and I went roller blading on the concrete bike path while our friend relaxed on the separate walking path. The bike path is clearly marked, but we were unclear about where to skate because there was no signage addressed to skaters and boarders. We eventually saw other skaters on the bike path, which was very crowded with bicyclists. Skating south toward Hermosa Beach, the surface of the path changed from concrete to badly-cracked asphalt, so it became very difficult and dangerous for us to roller blade, and we turned around to head north. All in all, we really liked the beach, but the parking situation left a lot to be desired. There were a couple of 5-hour lots, but those had no vacant spaces. Having to move your car every two hours is a hassle and a significant inconvenience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GringoEnMexico
40,Beautiful spot to enjoy the California shore,"Manhattan Beach is beautiful and has a lot of cute shops to see and nice places to eat. There is a walkway going the length of the beach where you stroll by beautiful beach homes of the rich (if not famous). But the vibe is low key and relaxed with an emphasis on enjoying some time in the sun in a really nice community. If you've got kids, this is the place to be. One thing is important to remember - parking! Parking is metered and limited. There are two ways to park - on the street (2 hr. limit, meters take coins and credit cards), and in lots. Lot parking has 2, 3 and 10 hour limits, but the meters take coins only. The shops will give you change, but you're better off being prepared and bringing as many quarters as you can (4$ = about 5 hours). But don't let it hinder you. Manhattan Beach is a beautiful destination and worth the trip (and the parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRK321

Our last minute vacay from the Bay Area and my family wanted a place to boogie board and body surf AND I wanted it to be close to yummy restaurants, coffee shops, nice boutiques, cool shops and places to walk around. THIS WAS IT! (thanks to TripAdvisor!)We set foot on the sand on a Thursday late afternoon (mid August 2012) and hung out north side of the pier. Nice sand, clean beach, warm ocean waters, bathroom facilities, tons of beach volleyball nets. My 8 yr old and hubby body surfed and loved every minute of it! Lots of surfers, families, couples, kids throughout.Parking is scattered throughout the neighborhood/beach area...we found metered parking (takes credit card) a few streets away. Good to see attentive lifeguards everywhere!The famous Strand is along the Manhattan Beach route. Pedestrian lanes and separate biking lanes. Wonderful! Gorgeous beach front homes/condos/pads right on the Strand. NEXT TIME we will be renting! We stayed at the Belmar Hotel but had to drive 1.8 miles to the beach area (and next time we also need a place w/a kitchen).We also had a fabulous time at Hermosa Beach (5 minute drive south) and Santa Monica Beach (incl pier and 3rd St Promenade; that was 30 min drive north including traffic).We will BE BACK!!!You won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maui_girlll
50,Nice Beach location close to LAX,We were in Manhattan Beach for 5 days and enjoyed every moment of it.

50,Great beach town,"I have mixed feelings about raving about this city. On the one hand, I want to be honest and share how wonderful of a town it is to visit (and live in). On the other hand, I don't want my city to be overrun by out-of-towners either because it's getting hard to find parking downtown! But really, it is the place where locals love to hang out. The beach is clean, good water quality (based on Heal the Bay), good waves for surfers. The water is a little cold to swim in, but on hot days, my kids don't mind. I usually need a wet suit. There are separate walking and biking paths that go all the way up past Santa Monica and all the way south to Redondo (although south of Manhattan Beach, the walking and biking paths converge). Restaurants tend to be pricey beachside, but there is a wide range from fast food (e.g., Wahoo's) to local moderately priced classic MB places (e.g., Mama D's, the Kettle, Uncle Bill's) to upscale foodie type places (e.g., Pierre's, MB Post). You will be able to find something good to eat around town although in general, the restaurant scene here is not as good as what you might find in L.A. There are lots of cute boutiques (mainly women's clothing), a large Skechers shoe store, and lots of hair salons. The only downside is that the pier is smaller than the Hermosa and Redondo piers, so there isn't a large plaza where concerts or festivals can be held. MB has their summer concerts on Sunday evenings in Polliwog Park, where the whole community gathers to enjoy free music and have picnics. Very family oriented, but also vibrant bar scene for singles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAWorkingMom
50,I love Manhattan Beach,My first visit here was in 1970 and my friend was lucky enough to rent an apartment right on the Strand.(Now you need to be a multi-millionaire to live there). I have been coming back ever since and it is my favorite place in CA beating out Napa and SF. People that live here are so happy and everyone seems to be in a good mood and why not it's a great place to live. The beach is big and clean with plenty of places to play volley ball. In fact I believe it is the beach volley ball capitol of the world. The 6 man weekend is wild with teams coming from everywhere to play. The town itself is so much fun with all the restaurants and bars and plenty of people out and about on the weekends. Weekdays are a little sleepy but this is a real daytime place during the week and summer. If I would pick a place to retire this would be it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phamus

I could have spent the whole day there if one in our party hadn't been ill.The shops on Manhattan Blvd. by the beach are also terrific.

A rash guard is great too (and an athletic fashion statement).DO wear/buy good sunglasses with UV protection. Cheap ones will open your eyes to UV damage.DO bring water in a re-usable water bottle. You'll look like a respectable local.DO reduce, re-use, recycle food and drink containers you bring to the beach.DO pick up after yourself when leaving the beach.DO pick up 3 extra pieces of trash when you leave the beach. Surfers and locals will notice.DO check out the tides online. See when they're high and when they're low.

50,The liveliest yet chic ladies' sportswear under the California sun is Fresh Produce.,"Located on Manhattan Blvd. in the Metlox Shopping Plaza , Fresh Produce is a shop filled with colorful, comfortable, yet chic clothing and accessories for women and children. Clothing ranges from skirts, shorts of varying lengths, capris, slacks, dresses, tunics and one of the widest assortment of tops of all lengths and styles imaginable. All the clothing can easily be mixed and matched making a complete outfit ready to wear upon leaving the store. Aside from the clothing, the next best thing I like about Fresh Produce is the ultra friendly staff that greets shoppers both long-time customers and vacationers alike. I must say that shopping at Fresh Produce for the clothing and meeting my old friends, the staff, are a must when I visit Manhattan Beach. FP represents CA dreaming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mygreyts

They require advance reservations so you really can't just show up. They take credit cards by phone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joebulldog1
40,Very nice but not the best,"We stayed in LA for a few days and went to Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. I personally like Hermosa better. It was cleaner and better maintained. However, Manhatten beach did have very good shopping/dining right around it (on Manhattan Beach Blvd). However, we were whistled at almost every time we tried to go in the water and told to get out of the way of the surfers. Both beaches were fabulous for taking in the ocean, but Hermosa just seemed more ""authentic"" of an experience then Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripulartravels
