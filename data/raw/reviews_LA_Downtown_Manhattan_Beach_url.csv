40,Enjoyable Stopover on long trip,"We chose to stay over on long flight out of country. Looked around for some place to visit during long layover and found reviews of Manhattan Beach. We went out to the pier, walked around the Main Street, visited shops and had a drink at a local spot before returning to our hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Supercalaf

50,Vacation,We stopped at Manhattan Beach and hung out for a little bit at the pier to do some sightseeing before we go off on our day today pretty nice. We have been here before years ago it was a chilly morning today,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paws0810

40,One of the Better Beaches/Areas/Beware of Parking,"We used to visit California all the time but now dread it and try to avoid anything California because the once nice must see attractions (including the beaches) are deteriorating and turning into toilet holes (sorry but it's true!) But Manhattan Beach area is still indeed a nice place to visit. The beach and small downtown area is clean, safe and pleasant. We enjoyed the shops/restaurants/bars along Manhattan Beach Blvd about 10 minute walk from beach. Please know walking up from the beach is all uphill and may not be feasible for some. The area is nicely diverse with people of all ages.Please Note: Parking is extremely difficult to find, not sure if this is a daily problem or only on certain days and times but reading other reviews it sounds like it's an issue. Parking is all metered and strictly enforced. As we sat having lunch we watched parking enforcement stop and check EVERY car writing tickets (gotta pay for all the bs somehow so why not target the tourists so they never return...real brilliant Cali!) Also be aware some meters are for only 24 minutes (not a typo ""24 minutes"" lol!) You think you were sooo lucky to find a spot and then realize its only for 24 minutes hopefully you didn't put your money in yet! What a great money making trap for the unaware tourist. And the other meters have time limits too most we saw were 2 hour parking limit so please be aware and check the meter before inserting your hard earned money. You could probably find free parking on the outskirts of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7066VSlisas
40,Great LAX time killer,"Had a few hours before my departure from LAX and decided to check out Manhatten Beach. Easy to get there (still had my rental car), took about 15 Min (9 AM). Beautiful beach and definitely worth walking around town. Lots of cool restaurants, bars and shops. You can walk, run or bike up and down the walkway between the beach and the front row houses. Showers and public bathrooms available near the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Galeazzi
50,Reminded Me of The Hamptons!,"If you've been to the Hamptons in NY, then this is what downtown Manhattan Beach reminded me of. My 23 year old daughter and I spent the day at the beach, had lunch at Lemonade's and walked around the little shops. It's a very cute little town with local shops, places to eat, and get ice cream. There is a steep hill to walk up from the beach to the little town. It was a nice place to spend the day.If you are there for lunch, dinner, or cocktails then try The Strand - GORGEOUS view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leenie18

There's something for everyone -- shopping (clothing, souvenirs, art, eyeglasses, etc.), hair salons, ice cream parlors, etc. The Manhattan Beach Pier and the ""Round House"" aquarium as well as the crashing waves on the beach are awesome.

50,Grand Adventure at the Beach,Wide open beaches with a 20 mile strand on the sand allows you to ride a bike or walk to your hearts delight without danger of colliding with a vehicle. Downtown MB is a mecca for shopping in a small beach community with upscale shops and loads of eating establishments. The MB pier takes you about 100 yards into the surf with a roundhouse at the end. A very safe community to walk around. Multi-million dollar houses with 30 foot wide lots and loads of recognizable sports and acting celebrities dot the strand housing. Volleyball courts are lined up waiting for the enthusiasts. Parking can be a challenge but side streets a few blocks away provide parking. Otherwise there are parking meters and a couple of small parking lots. On weekend summers and sunny days it will be crowded but who cares!!!!!

50,Small town feel,"Downtown Manhattan Beach is only 4 miles from the Los Angeles airport but has a small town feel. With the quaint specialty shops and restaurants, I recently spent 2 afternoons here while visiting L.A. There are some affordable shops and restaurants as well as higher end. The view of the spectacular beach can be seen from side streets while you are sitting on benches. It is just a 5 minute walk at the most from the downtown.

50,The best place to sleep and play in LA!,"After moving here 6 months ago from Denver and living temporarily in Venice for 2 months (gross!) and looking at 64 apartments everywhere from Hollywood to Redondo Beach and everywhere inbetween......I have to say...I am VERY pleased with my decision to live in Manhattan Beach! I only live a few blocks from the Pier (by the way, the MOST BEAUTIFUL PIER AROUND!!) and I LOVVVVE being able to walk downtown to the shops, restaurants, cafes, yoga studios, Pier, The Strand, the bike path.....it's pretty awesome! I am making my way to patronize every business there...just because I can! :)Whether I take a 4 hour bike ride up or down the coast with my doggie in the basket, or take a sunset stroll with him along the Strand to visit all the other dog owners or take a guest downtown to let them choose which restaurant they would like to try out while window shopping along the way! it's all pretty darn good, I must say!Somwhat upscale area and crowd (which is nice consdiering other areas around LA!!) and while it does lack a certain amount of ""edgy character"" it also lacks things like hoards of homeless people, visible numerous drug dealers and addicts wandering around, and just generally unsafe/creepy vibes. Though, I do realize that we are in LA (a ginormous city and everything that comes along with that)...I really like Manhattan Beach and all its high end conveniences and luxuries! And by the way.....I've never had this many guests in my life time! Everyone wants to come visit me after seeing all the photos I post online and all the cool, delicious, beauty that is Manhattan Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
50,Adorable Beach Town,"We stopped in Manhattan Beach after a day of Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, Hollywood, Sunset Boulevard, all the typical L.A. sights, and it was a welcome break. Everything slowed down once we got here. The small shops lining the streets, the coffee shops with locals hanging around, the families out for a day at the beach. It was a small town beach right in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CourtneyB445
40,Hot Spot,"Downtown Manhattan Beach is filled with great shops and outdoor pubs and bistro's. It's like out of a movie scene. A fun place to visit if you like to try new foods, people watch.
