10,Very disappointed.,"Very disappointed. Called to find the opening times to go to the park of roses. Got the times, check. When paying for the parking, asked where to park best to see the rose park. Got directions, check. Went to the park: closed. Unacceptable. If I had known this part is closed for a while, I would have gone somewhere else.",GuidoKarp
40,Pokemon Go hotspot,"If you play Pokemon Go Exposition Park is one of the best places to play in LA. If you don't 0lay Pokemon Go this is still a great spot to visit, they have multiple museums my favorite being the Natural History Museum. They also have this giant rose garden, super romantic spot. It's also a good spot to get in some cardio if you wanna jog around the area. Maybe don't go if the Rams are playing, it gets unbelievably crowded, it's where they like to tailgate.",Erick V. Berduo
50,My playground growing up,"I grew up in the neighborhood and I've been coming here for four decades and even bringing my daughter here while she was growing up. This was a weekly outing for my daughter and I and it never got old. I would make her grandparents walk over to the park and bring my daughter for a free outing. There's always something to see no matter how many times I've seen the museums, park, and rose garden I still enjoy coming here.",Creeping_Death_LA
40,Afternoon Family Day,Beautiful park with so many options to spend the full day in right by the USC Campus.

40,Not to be missed,"My pal and I arrived by ðŸš‡ metro link . The stop is expo park and USC. Facing the expansiveness of the park we searched for directions to enter the facility. Nothing at all. A kind man read our perplexing thoughts and pointed us to the entrance. A considerable walk for some but we made it with assistances from an attendant on the grounds. Where to go? Here is the answer go around to the other side of where your facing from the metro.The grounds were well kept, no bums or spooky people to harass you.Entrance was free to most exhibits but for King Tut there was, about $28 for adults. You can do better at Groupon.com.King Tut was more than I expected and I recommend it highly if you have the chance. Also for free you can see the science center and its many attractions. Of course the high light is the space shuttle Endevor itself.Tables to eat if you wish. Bring you own lunch.No place to check a bag. Few if any seats in Tut. Great way to spend a day especially if the outside weather is not to your liking. Not recommended for really young kids.",Bob D

50,"Fun day in the park- Museums, Rose Gardens, History and more!!","Went for the dinosaur hall at the History museum and enjoyed so much more! The old style exhibits rooms are a blast from the past and remind me of my youth walking through the Chicago Field Museum and the Smithsonian. Dinosaur hall(s) is pretty darn cool! Loved the gems exhibit too, just case after case of beautiful minerals thatexist in nature.The Science Center is really fun to stroll through and it's FREE if you don't need to go to any of the special exhibits and there is plenty to see for everyone. I wish they had all this cool hands on stuff when I was a kid.We could have spent half a day enjoying and reading all the details of the exhibits in the African American museum, again is FREE! So that will definitely be one we want to return to. Check out their calendar for special exhibits touring!You cannot go to the park without visiting the Coliseum! Home of the Olympics more than once! Ah, the history, the sportsmanship, the agony of defeat and celebrations of victory swirling around a flag covered stadium...Bring your lunch, and take a stroll through the rose garden and save a few more dollars.Was a great day for the two of us and we spent just $30, includes parking, 3 museums, a garden and the coliseum!!!

50,Beautiful Rose Garden,"I was pleasantly surprised, and totally geeked when I turned and saw the 'Jeffersonian'. Any fan of the tv show Bones will recognize (on either end of the rose garden) what is the exterior shots of the renown museum & lab from the show. Now I know why there are never any outside shots during the DC winters.",Tina K
50,Exposition Park,"Took kids; 3 and 5 years old. Went to Science Museum, Natural History Museum, butterfly exhibit, and then let the kids play in a shady portion of the rose garden. They were interested in the space shuttle itself for about two minutes but there are other things to look at there. They liked the dinosaurs and liked the butterflies. They were happy for over three hours which is pretty good. Get tickets ahead of time. Many things are separate entrance fees. Only parking I'm aware of is $12. Excellent museums, but located in the heart of traffic town so adjust schedule accordingly.",David N
50,Stop and Smell the Roses,"You really should take the time to visit the park's rose garden which offers a large variety of rose types. With the exceptional rains this year, the roses are really in bloom and fragrant. The garden rivals many other botanical gardens in the city and elsewhere and are well maintained.",BoboTravlr
40,Several Museums here,Parked for $12 and walked around this pleasant area. The rose garden was closed but you could see the mature bushes.

40,A nice place to walk,I was here a few days ago. We didn't even know this place existed until after we had gotten off the train at the station by USC. Very beautiful with flowers and trees. Also some airplanes on display outside. Lots of benches to rest on in the area.,davidson168
50,Romantic Morning Walk,The garden is just as beautiful as I remember it was about 15 years ago. The rose bushes have grown taller and the flowers render me speechless as I fall into my honeys arms...sigh of love! LOLSeriously though...I had a nice walk in the rose garden with my boyfriend. It was nice. The garden is still maintained well. I can't wait to visit again!,missjoyelle
50,Lots to do at Exposition ...,"Exposition Park is a regular outing for us & we ride the Metro from Culver City, it's easy & costs about $5.00. Leave the car behind. Once there we visit the Natural History Museum (& any special events like the Butterfly Garden, in season ), or the Space & Tech Museum, IMAX or walk the Rose Gardens. Fun, plus the Coliseum is there & USC is just across Exposition - lots to do! Enjoy. ...",David B L

I came to see the Dead Seas Scrolls, which was sold out-so I settled for the Rose Garden.The Rose Garden is a hidden gem hidden within all the nearby museum. There are various variety of roses, and I will bring a picnic the next time I come here. The grounds are kept up nicely, and nice venue to hold a wedding.",DanNanci
40,Lots of Roses!,This is a beautiful park with museums and a huge rose garden. We went on July and there were plenty of roses blooming. There were many varieties and some were very fragrance. There are also hydrangeas around the park. The fountain in the middle was empty at the time. South of the garden is the California Science Center and south of that is the LA Memorial Coliseum which hosted two Summer Olympic games. The park was free to enter but parking on the garage was $10 per car. You could easily spend hours here if you peacefully stroll through every planting beds and enjoy all the different variety of roses.,RainbowCowboy

40,History and beauty in LA,We spent the day at the museums and strolling through the rose garden.There is beauty in LA you just need to keep your eyes open. Everyone should take the time to stop and visit and read the history of LA. Many times we see the bad and forget the good and beauty that is also around us.,gardenmomof2

40,Wonderful!!,"My family and I visited this place in a Saturday. We all had a great time. We visited the science center, informative and interactive.Visited the African American Art Museum in the park. Small space but nice, friendly and informative staff. When we were there they had 3 great exhibits going on and we enjoyed them all.The rose garden was beautiful. Some of the rises were wilted, but most were still in bloom and exquisite.Site of the 1984 Olympics.Most of all it was free!Plenty of food places near the entrance and down the street.Some of the museums cost, like the natural history museum and the Endeavor Shuttle.There were 3 events going on while we were there, but the traffic was not bad. You can pay $10 to park or find a park on the street. We got there at around 10:30 and parked at a meter for 2 hours. Depending on how long you are gonna stay it may be more economical to park at a meter.I would definitely recommend going here.",MrsArnold266
50,Something for everyone...,"Located near U.S.C. football stadium (home of the 84' Olympics opening ceremonies etc.,) African American Museum, Science Center, (which is free,) and the Natural History Museum, the whole grounds have something to offer for all in your party, including breathtaking architecture, a gorgeous fountain you will have trouble keeping your kids out of, -(HAHA) and a quite extensive rose garden surrounding said fountain in the actual Exposition Park. We even enjoyed a butterfly pavilion, (still there till early September of this year, by the way,) outside of the rose acreage. My elderly Mom dearly loves butterflies, and was captivated by all the different varieties neither of us had ever seen before the sunny day we visited this site. Lovely day and area! Highly recommended!",TiffMateas
50,Fun for the Whole Family!,"If you plan to visit Los Angeles anytime soon and would like something to do relatively inexpensive that will interest the whole family; you may want to spend the day at Exposition Park. There's much to do there with several installments for the young and seasoned. The Space Shuttle Endeavour is a must see, or frolic through the flowers in the Rose Garden, whatever it is you choose to do I'm sure you'll enjoy. It is easily accessibly via public transportation by utilizing the Metro Exposition Train line. (please note there is an entry fee for some attractions while others are frree, and some may require advance reservations) Enjoy!",Eric G
50,"Great, free park and excellent museums","Exposition Park itself includes the Science Center (free except special exhibits), Natural History Museum (not free), Rose Garden (free), the Memorial Coliseum (depends on events), and the African American Museum (not sure). The whole area is a great place to spend the day, for any age. The rose garden alone is one of the largest in the country, and a great place to picnic. The historic architecture of the buildings, quality of the collections, and layout around a great garden help Exposition Park rival the museum set up of almost any American city other than DC. Expect the most families and student groups in the Science Center. Metro Expo line stops right across the street, otherwise parking is $10.",DeniseMW
40,Lots of Roses,"If you like roses, you'll love Exposition Park's rose garden. We were there on June 22, and the roses needed some care and pruning. I think the drought is probably the reason for this. I was a little disappointed that they were labeled for variety types, but I still managed to get some good photos. Someone please donate some money so these rose bushes can be labeled. There is a beautiful huge fountain in the middle of the park.",cynsha
40,Cool but watch your back!,"I like the diversity of attractions, especially for the kids (natural history and science museums). But the 'hood is not safe, so watch your back and stay close to the Exposition Park and USC campus.",Jerry Crawford
50,Ridiculously Beautiful!!,"Exposition Park's Rose Garden is a gorgeous little gem of a place nestled between a few of L.A.'s best museums!!...And since the Rose Garden is free, I am inclined to be obsessed with it LoL!!...They have 15,000 rose bushes...and every one of them is a stunner!! Inspired by a write-up about it I saw in a AAA magazine, this was my first visit to the park. I coupled it with a trip to the Natural History Museum's Butterfly Pavilion, right next door. It was late May, and the rose blooms were spectacular!! Added and unexpected delights included shaded gazebos for lingering and a quite impressive water fountain. If you are taking public transportation, the Expo line will get you right there!!",MademoiselleMermaid

40,Come for the rose garden then enjoy the museums,An absolutely beautiful stop in Los Angeles. The rose garden is absolutely amazing. Every type of rose you could every grow. The smell when the bloom is crazy. The museums that surround the garden along with the Colosseum are beautiful withing themselves. Used in many TV shows and movies shows how pretty this place is. Bring a lunch and picnic outside if your here to visit the museums.,Michael S
50,Highlight of SoCal trip: seeing the Endeavor space shuttle,"Although Exposition Park has a number of attractions, we set ourselves to check out the Endeavor space shuttle that was housed in the California Science Center. Since Endeavor, sitting on the back of a 747 plane, flew over the San Francisco Bay Area last year, it was a must-see on our trip.Who could imagine that for 11 of of us that we only paid $22.00 to get in, which did not include IMAX.To visit the Endeavor exhibit, it consisted of two parts and they are self-paced. You go through an area of exhibits, photos, and videos of the astronauts as they lived in the space shuttle and performed experiments. Optionally you can stay to watch this video of how they got the Endeavor from the airport to the museum, which was 60+ hours non-stop.Then you move onto this huge room, a hangar where the Endeavor is housed in a landing position. When you first walk in, seeing it takes your breath away and everyone is snapping away pictures. You could spend a good afternoon in checking out photos and exhibits and listening to volunteers.This exhibit is work in progress. They plan to erect the space shuttle in a take-off position and open it so that you could see its interior.We did check out other exhibits, which kind of remind me of parts of Monterey Bay Aquarium and California Academy of Science in San Francisco.Eating options included McDonald's and an area where you could purchase pre-made sandwiches and salads.",jpanda168
40,Best to visit during spring/summer,This place is filled with roses galore in the spring and summer months which make it the perfect family outing. Take lots of pictures of the kids by the fountain or walking through the rose gardens. From here you can easily visit the California Science Center which is free of charge or the Natural History Museum which does collect a small fee.,Caroline L

The History Museum includes an impressive exhibit of dinosaurs, gems and minerals, birds, and dioramas of mammals. Easily you can spend a day here. The Science Center includes some hands-on exhibits regarding marine life and ecosystems. A real treat would be to visit the Endeavor exhibit!In the African American Museum there are close to 3,500 works of fine art and artifacts. The Rose garden is an impressive display of colorful flowers providing a calm respite. Parking is $10.00. This is an area where one will not regret the visit!",PepperNewJersey
40,Great place to visit,Loved the rose garden. There was lots to do but didn't know when we got timed tickets for the space shuttle Endeavor that it was free that day. It was not advertised on their page so not happy about that. Get there early for parking which is $10.,Robyn H
50,Impressive rose garden among several museums,"One of the largest rose gardens I have visited! Defintiely worth a stroll while you are seeing some of the surrounding museums. There is a $10 parking fee for the entire Park, from which you can visit the Calif Science Center (free) with the Endeavor space shuttle, the African American History Museum (free), the IMAX Theatre ($8) or the Natural History Museum ($15 pp?). LA Coliseum/Olympic Park nearby also.",TrishG87
40,Very nice complex!,"A bunch of museums, some gardens and LA Olympic stadium in one place! 10 dollar parking fee. Science Center is free, opens at 10 am. A few fast food chains inside for lunch. The attraction is space shuttle Endeavour which has a 2 dollar per person fee. We have not been to the other museums so cant make any comments about them.",OzgurRosti
50,"Endeavor not just space junk, really!","The children in spellbound awe changed my mind completely at this display. Admittedly skeptical about watching massive space vehicle journey around LA, never got off the guarded view of space travel after watching two shuttle burn-I was uneasy about looking around this exhibit. But amazingly, American space adventure won me over. Hubble Rescue movie in IMAX should be viewed. Tour begins in Museum- need good shoes. Long walk to the grounded shuttle Endeavor-even a space travel skeptic: cost of admission reasonable. Ideas in exhibit birthed other ideas for me: feed people on earth-solve water shortages- distribute toilets- Maybe USA will lead other worldly ""endeavors"".",bugnurse56

50,Best public garden I've been to.,"The rose garden was amazing and free. My daughter and I walked around smelling roses for over an hour, and still didn't sniff them all! The roses were all in bloom, some just finishing and some just starting. The water fountain made a beautiful backdrop for all the color, and sitting in the shade of the pavilions was very relaxing. It's a great place to spread your blanket and enjoys a picnic. My daughter also wants me to note there are lots of ice cream vendors there! I wish I had this garden in my backyard. After that we visited the free science museum right next to the garden and had some more fun.",MommyBird53816

50,The Space Shuttle Flew Over It,"I've been to Exposition Park more times than I can remember, but perhaps the most memorable was yesterday when I stood in the Rose Garden and watched not one, but two flybys of the Space Shuttle Endeavour on it's way to the California Science Center. While this was a once ever event that you can't duplicate, the Shuttle will be on permanent display at the California Science Center on the south side of the Rose Garden starting about the end of October 2012.After watching the flyby, I wandered through much of the rest of the park.The Rose Garden was in full bloom and is open all year except the winter when it's closed for refurbishing. The fountain was working, but I've seen it dry during droughts.South of the Rose Garden is the California Science Center (formerly California Museum of Science and Industry). This is where the Shuttle will be displayed. The Center is filled with permanent exhibits, temporary exhibits, and an IMAX theater. In front of the Administration Building I noticed hand prints in concrete from actors from an old hospital TV show. At first I was confused until I remembered that this was once the Health Pavilion. There are other aerospace exhibits and aircraft on display.West of the Rose Garden is the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, also filled with three floors of exhibits and undergoing a major face lift with many new exhibits culminating in a centennial in 2013.East of the Science Center is the California African American Museum.The south half of the park has the Coliseum and Swim Stadium still in use after the Olympics of 1932.. Also the Sports Arena where I once saw the Ice Capades and the circus, has been used as a location for many movies and sporting events.These are the highlights but there are also smaller mini parks, lawns with impromptu ball games, and a real school.",Kenneth L

50,The Rose Garden was the Best!! An Oasis,"LA. A world of freeways and asphalt. Yuck!Then there's Exposition Park. It's the home to several very close museums (all of them good) but the best thing is the spacious Rose Garden. It looks like there are hundreds of different kinds of roses and a beautiful and large fountain. Perfect for toe dipping. Large trees line the nearby promenade and provide lots of shade on hot, sunny days.There's no long list of attractions here and maybe that's a good reason to visit. It's just a very nice place to hang out in the middle of freewayville.",air4ce

50,Looking for a Family Fun Day filled with learning come here to Exposition Park,"For the $10 all day parking fee, one can experience so much. Not sure if one day is really enough. When I review Exposition Park, I am talking about all the fun things here. California Science Center, Museum of Natural History, Rose Garden, the IMAX, African American Museum, Expo Center, LA Memorial Stadium and Sports Arena. This is a hub for bringing the kids.Yesterday, spent a couple hours here and I was in a rush with my nephew. Only had time for California Science Center and Museum of Natural History. Definitely could have used a couple more hours. Five year old nephew could get enough of the California Science Center. Had to drag him to see the dinosaurs at the Natural History Museum. Ten minutes before closing time, he was already asking me the next time we could come back. I will let the pictures speak for themselves.",galahad17
50,A Beautiful Day...,"The sunken, victorian, rose garden in Exposition Park has over 15,000 rose bushes!! It is really a beautiful sight to see...there are also four, large white gazebos and a large fountain in the center of the garden. There are many picnic tables surrounding the rose garden where you can enjoy lunch. Also, it's fun to see and hear the seagulls who have stayed inland in this lovely spot.The state of the art ""Sciencenter"" is free 7 days a week. It has a Taco Bell, McDonalds & a cafe, also a large gift shop. There is also an Imax theatre at the Sciencenter with a few different Imax films each day.The Natural History Museum has an entrance fee, but is free the 2nd Tuesday of each month. Take notice of the beautiful rotunda inside this old, lovely building.It is easy to reach Exposition Park from downtown Los Angeles. You can take the Dash bus, F route, for only 25 cents and 10 cents for seniors. (It takes about 10 minutes to reach Exposition Park via the Dash from downtown.)",loveLA
