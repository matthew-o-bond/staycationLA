20,No staff communication,Poor communication with staff. Those at door checking wristbands did not even know where to purchase them so guessed giving completely incorrect information. And because out daughters meet started at 330 they would not let us in at 230 even though the seating was mostly empty and our daughter was already in side getting ready. Not well thought out in my opinion.,Craig D

I don't recall anyone ever doing a real sound check. The speakers were all extremely loud and set so that they were echoing over each other. Not one speaker at the convention could be easily understood.,Chrys S
50,A Great Venue to have an Awesome Convention,I have been attending Monsterpalooza for about 10 years. The convention has been held at the Pasadena Convention Center for the pass four years. This convention has grown of the years and switched over from the Burbank Marriott Hotel. The Convention Center is easily found on Green St one block up from Colorado Blvd in Pasadena. Parking can be found next door at the Hilton or at any of the public parking garages located within walking distance of the center. There is a loading and unloading lane right in front of the Convention Center should you choose to use Uber or Lyft.,Rick A

50,Nice clean new facilities,"What you really have to love most about the Pasadena convention Center is that it’s pretty much brand new, and this makes it nice and clean and modern. Plus, it’s a smaller convention center so you’re not walking miles through booths. It made it nice for this show that I went to to get through the show in a matter of a couple of hours. And parking is easy too.",PilotMichael
40,Cute little convention center!,"This is the cutest little convention center I've ever visited! We were here for the 2019 SoCal Retro Gaming Convention, and when we arrived on Day 1 (Saturday), the line to get in wrapped around the corner, clear down the block.They managed the flow of people well, though, ensuring that the line moved at a decent clip and that the lobby wasn't too overrun with lost attendees.The convention took over a good number of the smaller ballrooms, as well as two exhibit halls. The halls were split into exhibit and vendor space and had a spot sectioned off for gaming.The other hall had the arcade, which was crowded and overrun with gaming enthusiasts (free arcade games will do that), but it never got to feel Comic Con-crowded.The staff was friendly and helpful, and did a good job of corraling the attendees that wanted to stand in a 3-hour line for a limited-edition POP! The restrooms were clean (at least, the women's restrooms were; my husband had grody stories from the men's restrooms), and the Starbucks flowed right into the center, which was convenient.The one strange thing that still confuses me is that the only had one door available for entry and exit. It never got clogged, but I expected to have a few more options to get on and off the floor.I can't speak to parking, as our first day there, we walked over from the hotel, and the second day, we were lucky enough to find street parking (and parking is free on Sundays).",SimeyTravels

50,Excellent business venue,"Pasadena has a very nice convention center. It’s practically brand new, and feels that way when you’re in the building. It’s smaller and much more intimate and makes for a nice small convention. It was nice that the event I attended moved to the Pasadena convention Center this time for the first time. I hope they continue to have it here.",PilotMichael

Please avail their service. It is good.",Guide791164
50,Memorable,Recently attended the Alien Con conference. I grew up in Pasadena and have attended many events here. The auditorium seating was comfortable and the auditorium was cool for a warm summer day making it refreshing as well. The architecture dates back near a hundred years but remains beautiful and appealing. I have always enjoyed this venue. Adjacent to the classic building is a new convention center that has all the modern amenities and comfortably supports large crowds. There are many places to park in the surrounding area as well as underground parking at the venue. I look forward to returning. Many restaurants are nearby to support eclectic culinary tastes.,eloyi690

Auditorium is beautiful and the theatre organ was outstanding. Ushers and staff were very polite and professional.There was an issue with using my credit card to pay for tickets. Both of my cards were declined. I had cash so it was ok. Called my bank the next day and it seems the reason for the decline was no PIN number was entered when requested. The staff did not ever hand me the handset to add a PIN number. I wonder if they realise that UK card generally require a PIN number to be used for a transaction to be processed. Might be worth mentioning this to front of house staff for the benefit of future overseas visitors.,MJC-DW

Note - the prices of the drinks are outrageously expensive - $5 for a bottle of water; $10 for a beer. The drinks and food are not worth it. Across the street are several more reasonable restaurants. The Sheraton is behind the convention center. If you manage to get a room, you don't need to rent a car to attend the convention center.",DMUH
50,A good convention center in a good location,"Over a long career, I've attended events in most of the larger convention centers in United States cities. The Pasadena Convention Center is unusual in its user-friendliness; there's easy, immediate access off the street; the front lobby is attractive and well designed, and the main floor spacious and comfortably set up. Most visitors think of the nearby Sheraton as the convention hotel -- and it is VERY near (at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, by comparison, the attached hotels are several times as far away, via endless corridors). Most CA venues are all about cars; the Pasadena Convention Center is friendly to pedestrians, as well.",charl0ttesville

He even signed my Kamen Rider Double Detail of Heroes photo book and took a picture with me! The viewing room kept guests entertained with movies, V-Cinemas and episodes of various tokusatsu franchises such as a showing of Shin Godzilla and the Super Sentai 40th anniversary/2,000th episode one hour special from Zyuohger!There were a good amount of vendors selling rare collectibles or just slightly used trinkets for collectors toy devices such as DX Henshin Belts as well as artists such as IDW's Matt Frank and Peach Momoko.

50,Americas Got Talent Taping Location,"Went here for an Americas Got Talent taping. This is such a beautiful auditorium inside and out. Nextdoor to the Civic Auditorium there is an ice skating rink and Convention Center, which happened to be opened. Entered both facilities to take a look. Overall, it was easy to get to the auditorium from the 210 Fwy...there are small permanent signs directing people to certain historical buildings, the Civic Auditorium being one of them. There is parking on E Street in front of the auditorium, but there was a sign indicating ""No AGT Parking."" I decided to park off Colorado Blvd, underground parking, in the Paso Colorado shopping center. I made sure to have my parking ticket with me to get it validated at the restaurant where I ate. Parking total cost $6.00 (with validation). As for as my AGT experience, it was Spectacular!!! Be prepared to be patient to stand in lines, but it was sooo worth it. Also, wear comfortable shoes. Happy I did, especially since I was jumping when the AGT Judges entered the auditorium. Bottled water was not allowed inside the building. How long was the process? I submitted my print out ticket to the crew at 1:30 p.m. Taping ended at 7:30 p.m....But so worth it!!!",donuvia

The core facility was built as part of the City Beautiful movement some 80 years ago and yet all of the facilities have been very well maintained. The main auditorium is excellent for theater and a whole range of presentations. The ice skating rink has been moved from its original location to a new place. The main problem is the signage and the not very helpful staff. You'd think the people running this place would occasionally check out how it actually functions. Apparently not.,TravelWarrior200

50,Power Morphicon 2014,"My brother and I recently attended Power Morphicon 4 at the Pasadena Convention Centre and were impressed the venue. It was spacious, yet set out well enough that you didn't get lost. Throughout the 3-day-convention the centre was kept clean and if there were any issues they were attended to straight away. The staff on hand did an excellent job at keeping everything in order.Sidenote: I was particularly impressed with the free Wi-Fi access.I can't wait for Morphicon 2016!The convention centre itself is absolutely stunning.The centre itself was well kept and clean, and the staff were extremely friendly and efficient.",quinni_224

50,Great Venue,"Went here for a Judo Tournament. Beautiful Venue with excellent sound system, comfortable seating, and a spacious lobby in Ballroom H. The Plaza was very nice and it was great to have a small Starbucks on site. Having a large parking garage across the street was also quite beneficial.",Tricia H
40,Bot Con 2014,"Well managed, clean and organized conference. Although there were some niggles: no signage at all outside on first 2 days of Bot Con, that was rectified by day 2. Some changes that could help would be shade for people who had to line up for some time outside in the hot sun.",spunkeymonkey78
10,IMATS at Pasadena Convention Centrr,"Beware!! SCAM at parking around convention center!! There was a uniformed ""parking attendant"" collecting $9 for ""Event Parking"" (a sign was added to the regular sign, that says you pay on your way out, which is what we did yesterday). The ticket didn't let us leave without paying more! The so-called attendant was long gone. I called the Pasadena police so that they would monitor this SCAM and they were not concerned about visitors in their community being robbed!!! So Beware!!",DianeTrue
10,SCAM at Pasadena Convention Center,"We attended IMATS today at the Pasadena Convention Center. We parked at Paseo Coronado which is very close. The was a uniformed person collecting $9.00 in cash for Event Parking. We had been there yesterday and took a ticket and paid afterwards, therefore I questioned this action. There was a Sign ""Event Parking"" added to the sign that was there. We paid. The tickets didn't let us out when we left, we had to pay the machine addition funds to exit. Of course, the perpetrator was gone and there was no number to call. WE WERE SCAMMED!!! I called the Pasadena Police to let them know that they should monitor this SCAM in their city. They told me that it was a private parking structure and was not their concern!! I thought stealing from people was a crime. My error. PEOPLE VISITING PASADENA: BEWARE!!!",DrFootWoman
40,Knife Expo,"Was a nice event, alot of vendors. Everyone was friendly. They had some beautiful knives, one was $9000.00!!!",4ChellyL1
30,Not Much to It,Decent but there is nothing distinquishing it from other convention centers. It was easy to navigate and the people working there were helpful.,JollyHenceforth
50,Best place to see performances in pasadena!,"love the convention center in pasadena,they have amazing programs and plays every year,we used to live in pasadena and we used to walk in the same day/evening before the play and get discounted tickets for $10 for the same night play if not full or sold out already,don't know if they still have this deal or not but worth trying if you live in pasadena or visit pasadena,is right behind paseo shopping center,check the mall and then go for the play;)",KhatM
40,"""Great Conventions and Shows""",Love the Watch and Clock Conventions yearly there. Plenty of rooms for classes and space for the shows. Top notch!,betsybubbles
50,Great facility!,I have been here many of tImes for work and to see events. Staff is great and professional. They think of everything you need and will get what you need when humanly possible. Parking is secure and since work pays for it I didn't mind the price.,Korelick
40,Nice facilities,"Went there 3 days for the bar exam, there was bathrooms on both sides of building I was in so I didn't have to wait in line. There are lots of restaurants right across the street from the center so I had good options for lunch. Parking was $9 but I found free parking for the day on Euclid south of Del Mar, a ten minute walk to the center.",KittiekatBrooklyn_NY
40,Great place,"Very nice facility, green energy at its best, lost of natrual lighting, nice use of space. a must for any confrence.",Johnnycatt
40,Don't pay for parking here!,"Parking garage attendant told me there is no where else to park anywhere around there; but at $9 for every in and out, including same day, I said I'd 'look around"" anyway. Glad I was early and had time. There is free parking only 1/4 mile south. And before you get that far there is 2 hour parking. It was a short walk each time. Saving me $56 total considering I was there 3 days and had to leave and come back once each day. Or, $45 if I had bought a 24-hour pass.",IslandGuy42
