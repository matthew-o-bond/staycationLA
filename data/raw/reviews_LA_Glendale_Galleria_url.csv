Galleria has it all..entertainment, shopping, food, etc. You can buy a delightful chocolate for your sweet or some sports bling for your guy; dine on great food options or shop til you drop.Parking..a bit of a nightmare, but you can manage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nelohshopper
40,Popular spot for locals,"I'm not a fan of malls - I actually hate going to them but this one has a different vibe. It's extremely rare that I go shopping to buy stuff, it's more for visiting one of the restaurants or for people watching. The parking lot can be a nightmare but what do you expect when this is the only transportation option to arrive here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
40,Great shopping place.,"The Galleria is one of the countries largest, oldest and most popular places in Southern California. It has hundreds of stores, tons of restaurant and is in the heart of the city of GLENDALE. The parking is free, access is very good for every type of person with the exception of elevators. Not too many of those and well they’re very far apart. Stores range from very small to very large. Main ones being Target, (the newest of the big stores) Marcy’s, Bloomingdales, Apple, (The first Apple store in the country) Hollister, Adidas, T-Mobile and ATT and Verizon to name a few.Food in this place is very diverse. From burgers to Mediterranean to Sushi and hot dogs; this place haze it all. And if that wasn’t enough if you walk across the street there’s Brand at Americana. A very upscale mall with more to see. It’s like a two for one. The Galleria has three levels with primary ones for most of the mall and the third one all the way in the back that conecta you to the American across the street. This way if it’s too hot or the rain is crazy you can walk over in air conditioned style. Great place to hang out and one of the cooling stations for the summer if you happen to not have AC. It doesn’t have too many places to Jaír sit with consuming anything, even though you can. Then again it is a mall and they want you to buy, buy, buy. If you’re coming during the Christmas season bring your patients and come out lots of time, or better yet take a taxi. It’s well worth the money spent. It’ll keep you sane. I’ve hear of people being stuck in traffic for 3hrs before they reformed the way cars circulate. Now if it’s bad it’s about 30 minutes to get in or out. Come down and explore this greats place and have lunch while doing a little shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielR84

30,"Overwhelming, crowded, and noisy!","Yes. It's a beautiful and enormous multi-storied shopping mall. And it precisely brings to mind why a few of us bailed out years ago. Southern Cal does so many things well. Many of these things are bigger than life.But all of these things end up in one's driving in circles in the parking structure looking to get lucky and find a parking spot. We finally found one on level six.And then you get into the Galleria and realize this is probably the only time in SoCal that people arrived somewhere in a carpool. However, this is the particular mindset of Angelenos ( I were born one..... so it's not personal) is that the longer the lines, the cooler a place is.Truly every whim and desire can probably be fulfilled here. And I'm sure folks who now call the middle of nowhere home probably would be well advised to avoid visiting shopping venues on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChinaLake1

A good number of stores to suit the whole family, and my husband would often wander into his favourite stores and catch up to me.The mall has a good sized food court but as we were here in early December, Christmas shoppers were also visiting in large numbers so finding a table was near impossible.The crowds made the mall noisy and getting into some stores was a mission, but it was a great few hours spent shopping.Surprisingly, we found a parking spot easily and then headed over to Americana for a spot of shopping as well.I think it is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Woodys5

I can not recall one single positive shopping experience there - it's loud, it's unstylish, and everyone seems so unmotivated - when I asked a Galleria employee for directions to the Sprint store she did not even bother to answer.Not that we misunderstand: we tried five stores yesterday willing to spend top dollar - and did go home empty-handed. My wife almost cried at Victoria Secret - the service is absolutely unacceptable there.

But the Galleria has improved itself and now the Americana and Galleria complement each other very well. Parking is easier at the Galleria since it is free and you don't have to worry about getting validations like at Americana. There is a wide variety of stores and the mall is anchored by Bloomingdales, Macy's and Target (yes, Target).

30,Development in the area has made ut congested,"While there are some nice stores and places to eat around the mall, Glendale has decided to build A LOT of apartments in the area which is making the area congested. Plus, with an aging population there are a minimal number of handicap parking spots. Many people park at the Galleria and walk over to the Americana across the street so they don't have to pay for parking. I've stopped going to the Galleria and instead head over to Santa Anita. It has many of the same stores and it is easier to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/findalexa

10,Karen's Toy's in Glendale Gallaria,"Went to Karens Toy store to purchase a birthday present my mother had her service dog with her and after about 10 min. of looking she started to walk over to ask the cashier how much the item she wanted to purchase was when the manager of the stir said ""Stop you can't be in this stir with the dog"". It was explained, it was a service dog, then the manager said ""I'm allergic to dogs , you have to leave now!"" Mom told him it was a poodle and was non allergic, the manager then said, ""I'm alert if to poodles! Leave the stir now!I told him it was against the law to not permit a working dog, and she would report this incident, again she was told to leave. It was very upsetting to be kicked out of the store and not be able to buy the gift we wanted, the Mall managment was informed and said they would call the owner of the store, nothing was heard from anyone after that! If you have a service dog or any dog as all dogs are allowed in this mall stay away from Karen's Toys they obviously don't want your business if you had a dog with you! Had a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/147jasminc

50,Very Pleasant Shopping Experience,"What made the experience so pleasant was that the parking was free while the other mall charged parking beyond two hours, even if it was only a fraction of the following hour (this if you had your ticket validated by one of the shops.) Galleria is the older mall and although it did not have a dancing fountain, it's still worth going to and you could check out the deals. Clean and wide spaces. An assortment of food at the Food Court. Excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaK_12

20,Annoying vendors,"The mall is like any other mall with the exception of a seemingly disproportionate number of vendors who stop shoppers hustling for business. I was stopped 5 times on the bottom floor alone within 10 minutes. Some of those hustling for business were nice and pleasant but others quite intrusive and inappropriate: ""Do you have someone special in your life?"" one asked me while another touched my shoulder and said ""What do you do when your muscles are sore?"". I did not want to be rude but after a while it was a bit tasking not o be so. I understand that those guys had to do their job but still I felt it was too much. It was quit an unpleasant experience for me shopping at the Galleria and I am not planning to shop thee again soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dasmarek

There is Target for those price conscious shoppers and Bloomingdales for those savvy ones. They renovated the food court too, and there are good choices - from Hotdog on a bun to Panda Express, there is Brazilian and Japanese... etc... Walk across Central avenue to go to Americana. Love to shop here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
40,Glendale Galleria Shopping,The new remodel is a great improvement.Lots of shops with something for every budget. Nordstrom's is no longer there- moving next door to the Americana. The brand new Bloomingdales is sleek and modern with very eager sales staff. With the holidays coming up expect large crowds. Be patient and you will find parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJoytk
40,Just remodeled,They finally did some upgrades to this place. They replaced the dark carpet with tile which looks really nice. Nordstrom's is moving to the Americana so it will be interesting to see how that works out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
20,Bring your walking shoes & energy,"I dread going to this mall, the layout is awful! It is a long L shape, there's Nordstrom, Macys, JCP and Target of all stores! Oddly the ends of the mall where Target and Nordstrom are located have 3 levels while the middle sections JCP & Macys have 2 stories. I think whoever engineered and designed this mall was clearly not thinking of its customers and how inconvenient it is to get from one end to the other. The main food court is located near Macys/JCP side while another smaller food court is located near Nordstrom on the 3rd level. On this visit in June 2013, they were again doing construction. Some of the corridors had the stairs all ripped up, it looked like they're installing a second elevator near JCP which is much needed since the single elevator barely does much to alleviate the swarm of tired visitors. The corridors are not wide enough, barely wide enough to accomodate folks who insists on walk side by side (3-4 at a time), go visit Cerritos or Lakewood Mall and you'll see and enjoy the difference. You can actually fit a few wheelchair and strollers in the same side of the corridor at Cerritos and Lakewood. While trolling through the mall, I noticed there were only a few benches laid out near JCP and they were all taken by exhausted shoppers. If this mall is so wonderful and popular, why doesn't it put out more benches and seating for folks who need a break from the 4+ hour ordeal? I don't want to trek over to either food court to find seating. Over the years, the food court options have gone from ok to nay! No more Kyochon and if you want a descent burger, In-N-Out is located on Brand so not quite walking distance when you are hungry. While I was on the second floor by Charlotte Russe, the tile floor reflected light from the ceiling which made it appear as if there were steps so it tricks your mind into thinking you might miss a step. I recommend Galleria only if you want to be annoyed with parking, find the ever elusive merchandise not offer at any other malls because this location is not worth the headache or hassle. I hate the parking as there's never enough space for two cars to pass because if one car is waiting for a spot and there's a line of cars behind the waiting car, you can't go around them. When exiting the mall, there's a convoluted route to follow to exit so its not a straight shot to get out of the awkward structure of maze where some areas are again 2 stories while other parts have 4 stories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorrrento
50,"Beautiful Courtyard, Gorgeous Fountains & A Perfect Afternoon","This location is beautiful! The fountain in the center is soothing, fun to watch (as it changes its patterns) and nice to sit on the edge and talk, or people watch. The noise of the water carries through the whole courtyard, and really adds to the ambiance.There is a good selection of stores, and none of them are too expensive, so they appeal to everyone. There is also a movie theatre, and several restaurants. Across the street is the actual galleria, which is a basic shopping mall, though still quite large and with a good selection. However, the outdoor courtyard is definitely more worth the visit. It has better restaurants, many with outdoor seating, and much more fun to stroll through. On a sunny day, which is easy to come by in la, it makes for a perfect afternoon of entertainment. It can make for a very romantic day, walking, holding hands and sitting by the fountain. There is also a big playground for children, and stores they would be interested in like LEGO, so it can be a good place for families too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleClownfish47
50,Good Selection Shopping,"I was in a family reunion and came here to do a little shopping,I was impressed with the selection. Stores I had always wanted to go to and were not available from where Im from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rerora3
30,Typical American mall,Interesting mall with Apple Store and LEGO Store. There was a nice chocolate store tho i forgot the name. And there was a kiosk which you can put your face on little teddy bears. Very cute. Also with Target. Food court was not too bad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McFaren
40,Excellent Mix of Stores,"This mall has a nice mix of stores, with something for everyone. Nordstrom, Macy*s, Apple, Disney, and five stars especially for having the only LEGO store in all of the Greater Los Angeles area!The only minor issue was the salespeople in the store carts through the center of the first floor of the mall randomly approach for solicitation, but depending on whom you ask, they might just be doing their job.Good pleasant fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inavigator
50,HUGE MALL!,"This is a very large mall located in Glendale (near North Hollywood). It has every shop you can think of, and an abundance of restaurants as well. I highly recommend this mall to anyone shopping in the Glendale area! You will not be disappointed!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyalJerky
50,Very Nice Shopping,"The Galleria is a great place for shopping, the main mall area is aged, but its large and clean. Outside you have the Americana outdoor area, which is very nice and upscale. Definitely a good place to spend the day browsing stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911BobB
40,As long as the Empire State Building is tall!,"The Glendale Galleria is huge. I recall being told when it opened, eons ago, that is was as ""long as the Empire State Building is tall"" since then it has be expanded and upgraded numerous times. The diversity of shops, food choices, and convenient parking brings me back time after time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
10,"Very disappointed , will not be recommending.","Having made a trip of a lifetime to America, with our severely disabled son. We went to the is mall during the Los Angeles section of our trip. We made our way to the customer service desk to enquire about a wheelchair to take our son around the mall. We were told in no uncertain terms, which was also clarified by the manager over the phone, that if you didn't have a valid California state driving licence that you would not be entitled to avail of a wheelchair. I find it hard to believe that if you are travelling form a foreign country and you want to shop and SPEND money, that you should be discriminated against for having a disabled child. I have already emailed the customer services section on their website and as yet no one has had the common courtesy to respond. I know this will have no impact on most people reading this review, BUT if you ever have to travel with a disabled child you will realise how difficult it can be. The Glendale Galleria stood out, as we have experienced nothing but extraordinary customer service in America. I will wait to find out if we ever receive any response.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevielatphoto
50,Great Shopping,"One of my favorite areas in L.A. Shopping is great, but the environment is what gets me. I love the Bermuda grass surrounding the beautiful fountain. The area is always clean and just a great shopping experience all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcusW975
40,Great place to shop,"We went to this mall to go to lego store. We found one item with 10% discount. Not much but O.K. The staff at this lego store here was very helpful. The negative point was, there was homeless people inside the mall, especially when you are having your meal at the food court. They come to your table with a piece of paper stated their conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589roseh
50,A gorgeous shopping destination,"Every year we visit the USA, no matter how long our stay is in Southern California we always set aside a day to visit this beautiful shopping centre. Great stores in a beautiful location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cruiser803164
40,"A good collection of shops, fairly close to Hollywood","We visited here as our big day of shopping on our trip to the US. it was a good place to shop as it had a god variety of shops, and several department stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandash67
40,Nice Shopping,Nice shopping. The concierge was very nice to find me a taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alshajj
50,Too beautiful to call it a mall!,"The Galleria is one of the increasingly popular venues that feature upscale condos on the same premises as upscale retail and restaurants. There are the expected upscale retailers like Apple Store, Williams Sonoma, Coach, Ann Taylor, Abercrombie and Fitch, et. but also a host of great places to eat and the big retailers like Macys, Nordstrom, JCP. Bloomingdales is coming next year! A shopper's paradise. However, the reason I say it is too good to call it a Mall, is that it has beautiful appointments such as an exquisite centerpiece fountain that (during night when we visited) features a dancing water to musical accompaniment. Sounds hokey, but was very well done. (It isn't the World of Color show at Disneyland -- but close -- and costs a helluva lot less!) There is also a vintage trolley that circles through the mall for those who are tired of walking, which is a nice touch. And then, there are the beautiful condos and lobby that you must pass through to access parking (at least we had to in order to get to our car). The combined effect of the above was to create a very pleasurable shopping experience. Judging by the well dressed, well behaved yet animated crowds, I was not alone in this assessment. If you are in or near Glendale, it is worth a visit (especially after dark to see the fountain).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TishMiles
30,shop out,"Glendale Galleria is a great shopping mall with many good high street shops, nothing too high end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lailo1
40,All you need,This is a great shopping centre which is connected to another group of shops across the road called Americana. There is every shop in this mall that you need. All the big names and big department shops. A huge Target and Macy's. You could spend a day here no problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
50,"Large mall, great variety, lots to see/buy.","Iv'e gone here many times and always have great memories. Lots of shops, this is a large mall with many more shops in the immediate surrounding area. Parking is sometimes limited and especially difficult to find during peak holiday shopping season. Would recommend to either go early in the morning to find parking or avoid the traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gambit4Hire
