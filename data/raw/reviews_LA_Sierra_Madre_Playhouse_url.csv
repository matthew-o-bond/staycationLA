50,The Joy Luck Club,"The theater is very community oriented and intimate, with a capacity of less than 200. Over the years, I have attended a few of the productions. Though small sacks, they were all good quality shows and the acting was quite good. The prices are reasonable. Try attending one of the upcoming productions.",Patrick L
50,Unique Little Venue,"On Halloween, the city of Sierra Madre shuts down their main streets and the local businesses give out candy. Amazing that this town can keep this tradition. The Playhouse was running a Halloween short movie just for the one day and we had never been into it before. It's a beautiful little, old-fashion theater of about 100 seats set up for small production plays. We are looking forward to going back soon.",lynndds
50,Great little theater,We just went to see Tuesdays with Morrie. Our last few productions we have attended have been very hight quality. Excellent little theater.,cookpias
50,Small town Playhouse,"This Playhouse is a local gem. The plays are outstanding, the variety is good and what a wonderful way to spend an evening in our local town - tickets are very reasonable.We took our kids there for years to see the Christmas productions.",vickieshack
50,"First rate small venue, many talented people.","Have been to several performances at they Playhouse, and have enjoyed them all. It's a great showcase for local talent, and the shows are always entertaining. Come early, sit where you like, enjoy the show!",DonaldYokum
50,Fantastic,This little playhouse is simply amazing. Very popular and been in Sierra Madre for many many years. Great venue and always a line out front. It's fun to drive by and see the actors walking around getting ready for the show. Sierra Madre Is a great small town and has so much to offer and the play house is a perfect example of this.Enjoy!!,David F
50,Best 99 Seat Theatre in all of Los Angeles,Dang you for putting this up. My favorite go to theater in all of Los Angeles. With 99 this historic theater in Sierra Madre doesn't have a bad seat in the house.Their productions are among the best I've ever seen. The Creative Director and Managing Director are a powerhouse team that bring even old plays to life with relevant twists.Buy tickets in advance as many shows sell out quicklyThere is ample parking in and around the theatre.,frazgo
30,Community theatre,"Interesting, small productions. Local talent mixed with seasoned semi-professionals. Occasional performances of music.",fiddlernan
40,Small Village Theater,"So this place started as a small town movie theater in the 1950's(?) and later was converted to a live theater. Yes, it is very small, so the production costs have to be kept to a minimum, but parking is free and tickets are reasonable, so consider this an alternative to driving to the L.A. Music Center once in a while. They have kid's plays on some Saturday/Sundays, which are fun for the whole family because they include audience participation.",MaryMargaretMcMertz
50,Class Act: Sierra Made Playhouse,The playhouse performances and seats have greatly improved since the westside group took over. It's a bargain as live theater goes. I like the fact that they have torn down the building to make room for something else but are using it for everyone's pleasure!,DamePeg
40,Intimate Theater,"Very nice small black box theater to experience a play. I sat about 3-4 rows back from the stage and could hear the actors well. Seating is comfortable with good leg room, but I had difficulty visualizing actors if they sat on the stage. The director provided a discussion after the play with the actors.",Kathy R
50,Always great plays,"Of course the plays change and we don't see them all, but last night we went to Truman Capote's Christmas Story and it was very good. Patrick Geringer played the little boy (about 10 years old) and he was amazingly good.Over the years we have seen quite a few plays here and loved most of them.",Bill B
50,Always....Patsy Cline,"This show has been extended several times and for good reason. Ten of us went Saturday night and were absolutely thrilled. Cori Cable Kidder was outstanding as Patsy Cline and Nikki D'Amico was equally terrific as Patsy's biggest fan, Louise. One of the best evenings of musical theater I've had in a very long time.",Robert L
