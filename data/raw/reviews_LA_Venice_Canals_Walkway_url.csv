50,Lovely Stroll to soothe the Soul,"We went yesterday as I need to get out of our house. It was such a lovely time. Not many people at all (which is great during this Covid-19). It's very close to the Venice Beach. The houses are all different styles and the canals reminded me of Holland. The Venice Canal Historic District is a district in the Venice section of Los Angeles, California. The district is noteworthy for its man-made canals built in 1905 by developer Abbot Kinney . Go, stroll and you will be so happy you went there. Park on Dell Street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissValerieCA
50,Good for a nice walk,"Does not take a long time to get through, this walk is great if you want to park in a residential neighborhood and not have to pay for parking for the beach. Nice homes and back yards to walk around. If you are going to Venice beach, park in this area and take a nice stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norjeff2
40,"Yes! See the Canals. Venice is a ""should see"" but not a ""must see"" attraction","Venice is a quirky, charming delight of a beach town. It was once a bit gritty, but time and the escalation of property values have mellowed the place a bit I suspect. The canals, lined, with homes in the $2M plus range, are a fun way to burn an hour strolling peacefully and checking out the fun and sometimes frivolous architecture/yards/decorations. The place is very simply a delight for the eyes and I'm embarrassed that I went so long between visits. It's an easy place to walk and linger, but the bridges or the canals are steep and may present challenges to the physically impaired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGaucho1987
40,Charming,Relaxing stroll with family along the canals. It was a bit of a surprise find and a nice change in scenery from the nearby beautiful beech. Highly recommend it if you have 30-60 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565sanjayk
40,Nice,We only did a short walk around this area but very pleasant. Shame about the rest of the area though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengel-IoW
40,Peaceful Escape,I write 'escape' as compared to much of LA the Venice Canals actually felt relatively safe and were quite quiet. We strolled around for only about 30 minutes taking pictures and admiring the architecture and it was very nice. There were lots of dog walkers but everyone was friendly and it made for a nice time. Another staple visit of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MR_Travels1920
50,Peaceful Walk Among Charming Homes,One of the few places in LA without cars. Walk the canals and marvel at the quaint cabins and modern homes side by side in this wonderful neighborhood. One day I hope to come back and rent one for a vacation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cincin2100
40,Peaceful stroll,This is not what I expected to find in Los Angeles USA it really is like a little Venice. We walked along the walk ways and marvelled at the different boats tied up belonging to the residents. We even saw a couple of ducks in one then went in to the water and swam away leaving an egg on the seat in the boat however it could of been there before them. This is a great place to take time out away from the hustle and bussle of the town. Suitable place for all but as there is no fencing children would need to be closely supervised and adults need to walk with care.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday-view23-7-11
40,Very picturesque,"This is a few blocks from the beach and if you visit Venice it is a must see. Beautiful houses are built on either side of the canals. Each one is different and there are lots of ducks , bridges and little boats bobbing up and down in the water You cross bridges and wander through the streets by three canal. A lovely way to spend an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsmon2016
50,Gondola ride in Grand canyon,It was a mesmerising ride in Gondola. We embarked the gondola near Mt Square rowing in between the colourful buildings underneath bridges.

30,Pretty area for a walk around,This area is nice for a walk around.

20,It didn't look inviting,"Not only the access/gates to the canal walkways where I was in Venice looked like tit was locked but even if it was open I would not be interested to go there since the ""river"" in the canal was disgusting and smelly....it looked more like a sewer than a canal. But maybe it is that way only in one spot at the end since there was a large bird sticking around and looking for food in it? (Venice Blvd and Canal Street)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag

30,Interesting...,"Yes, cute houses and great flora and people gawking and original bungalows next to $4m new 2500 sq ft modern architecture, but the canals are dirty and smell. Yes, interesting that there are canals and it could be a great experience, but the whiff of decay and the stuff floating on the canals really mars the experience. Venice get yourself dredged!

40,Picturesque escape in Venice Beach,The canal area is a lovely quiet escape from the madness of Venice Beach promenade. Properties that look onto the canals range from quaint to stunning (and expensive). Ducks and herons frequent the canals and its a very nice area to stroll along.

30,Something unexpected and different in the city sprawl,"Totally incongruent with anything else we’ve seen so far in LA, a strange oasis of calm waters in the midst of this crazy city. Pleasant to spend a while walking the canal banks, crossing bridges and observing the weird collection of individually designed properties that abound here. Usual ripoff parking farce nearby, but as the Americans say, ‘get with the programme’!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig1961_01

40,Interesting walk,The canals are pretty dirty but angled views across the boats and wharves to the bridges and interesting houses are very nice. There were even a few people boating around.

50,Fun to visit virtual world GTA V Canal in real life!,"So I am a big-time player of GTA V and I always liked the canal walkway in the game. Its so picturesque.

Spent about 20 minutes here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akhilpwalia
50,"Quaint, picturesque area - Friday, Saturday, Sunday","We could not get enough of this picture-postcard area. Loved both the old and new houses planted along the canals. The wooden bridges, the flowers, the water all made it special. However, we learned that the canals are allowed to drain during the weekdays, so do go on the weekend. Otherwise, I would guess it can be quite stinky!! We ended up each day walking through the area, never tiring of the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/architect_ed

Drive one way down Dell and over four small bridges or park and walk over the same or the smaller pedestrian bridges that start at Grand Canal Ct.We were not able to time our visit correctly and were only able to view the canals during low tide. Views of the mud and boats stuck in the mud was not that exciting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wireless_in_CA
50,Nice place for a walk,"This is a very nice and quiet area to take a walk which is in big contrast Venice beach. Landscape it`s very colourful and the canals are very clean. It actually reminded me more Amsterdam rather than Venice, so I wouldn´t say it´s a unique place but definitely worth it to take a walk and spend some peaceful time after the noise and crown of Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chibifillo
50,Unique walkway,"We visited on a Thursday evening. We were told they typically drain the canals on Tuesdays for cleaning and allow them to refill on Thursdays. So, we were able to see the water rising, which was pretty neat. The houses along the canal are unique and fascinating. We parked just outside the Kanau area on the street, and enjoyed walking through the public sidewalk on the canals. Definitely a highlight of our Southern California trip so far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TB_Rays_fan_NJ

30,Go at high tide only,"The houses along the canals are lovelySeeing how each backyard along the canal is furnished, decorated and planted makes the walk interestingHowever, we went at low tide and the canals were near empty.

OMG!! this was so different from the normal LA housing. The beautiful housed lined up alongside the canal is very beautiful. Each housed have beautiful garden. So picturesque. The reflection of the housed on the canal, the ducks walking along was just amazing. Early morning blue sky and this landscape was just amazin. Private boats were there. The small bridges over the canal was trying to bring the original feel of venice. But sad part is the stagnant water. I am not sure what is the process of cleaning these canals. But for a tourist it was amazing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reena56

30,Doesn't live up to the hype,This would have been a nice area years ago before all of the canals bar one were roaded over. The houses are right on top of one another and the canal water is filthy and stagnant. The gardens were lovely and the bridges picturesque. To call this area Venice is taking liberties!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwichickAuckland
50,"Pleasant, relaxing surprise","Even after hearing about them, it was a pleasant surprise to see the quaint homes along these residential canals.This ain’t no Venice, Italy (been there) but these have a charm all there own and stand in stark contrast to the loud, sometimes gaudy beachfront walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyWanderer

One afternoon we made a trip to check them out in real life. Parking is an issue, but there are some lots a few blocks away and then you walk to the canals. They are worth seeing.

It was a good afternoon outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamarahammer
30,Worth Look,"We passed these on a guided bus tour of LA and decided we wanted to visit Santa Monica, Venice Beach and the canals another day. Whilst I would agree with others comments, for me they were worth seeing, especially after having been told about the history of how Venice was developed on our tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SagaloutsTour
30,Disappointing,"Made a point of visiting while in the area – not quite sure what I expected, but was underwhelmed by what I found. A criss-cross of residential shacks (probably worth a fortune) cut through by half empty, rather dirty/smelly waterways. You can walk over a series of bridges which connect pathways through the area. Interesting enough to spend a half-hour or so if you want a break from the nearby Venice Beach, grubby and strewn with homeless people and their detrius.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bazb949
10,Don’t waste your time,"Nothing positive to say about the canals. You can only drive over the canals. The sidewalks are for access for the residents. The are dirty and smell. There’s nothing to look at, it’s just water and private homes, that’s it. Just look at the photos and save yourself time & headache. Believe me it’s not worth sitting in heavy traffic to see the canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddy214
40,Cool views,"We drove through the canals neighborhood but we really wanted to stop to enjoy the sights. This is the challenge! We found a place to pull over and leave the car with one driver in it, while the rest of us checked out the canals. We couldn’t spend too much time here, but it was still really interesting.The little bridges and canals offer a backdrop for some beautiful photos. There are fantastic houses along the walk with beautifully maintained gardens and tiny patios. The canals are very shallow, lined with canoes, row boats and kayaks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenRed2014
20,Very Sad,The Venice of old has long since vanished and the three little blocks that have been preserved of the canals is pitiful. The boardwalk and areas around the beach are filled with the homeless. It is a good exercise in social justice but not a place for tourists if you are trying to show a positive side of L.A. They should go to Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonsgirl
30,Unusual sights,"If visiting Venice Beach, it is worth walking over to the Venice Canals. A couple of blocks of houses with canals. The area has some interesting architecture, many bridges and some bird life.Less than an hour needed. Pram accessible. No public toilets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chop_hsuey
40,A must see if you’re in the area,"We had a wonderful time walking around the canals. The homes, gardens and bridges were fun to see. Not something you get to do every day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melbitz
50,Nice place for a peaceful stroll along the waterline,"Very nice place for a peaceful stroll along the waterline. Drive to 311 Washington Blvd, Marina Del Rey, CA and park at nearby parking meters. Begin this walk near the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Sanborn Avenue. There is a small sign that says ""Venice Canals Walkway,"" turn in and begin exploring!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TejasMehta
50,Beautiful and tranquil,We loved wandering around the Venice canals. The homes are beautiful and it was a lovely respite from the busyness of Venice Beach. We were there on Christmas Day and lots of the bridges were decorated with Christmas decorations,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynic
50,Peaceful,Venice canals are picturesque and peaceful place. I recommend a visit to everybody who wants to escape from busy streets. It is a just a few minutes of walking from the beach but it is cxompeltely different world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvaF2Eva
40,The good life,"The Venice Canals Historic District is a part of Venice in Los Angeles. Tobacco millionaire developer Abbot Kinney built these canals in line with his vision of recreating Venice in Southern California. A little known fact about Kinney is that apart from being a developer, he also was a conservationist!The lighted canals with arched bridges and gondolas with gondoliers actually imported from Venice, helped Kinney sell property lots in this newly developed area. Apart from their novelty, the canals were also meant as aquatic arteries to connect the residential community.Sadly however, as with many other things in the US, the Venice Canals too became a casualty to the rising popularity of automobiles. Built in 1905, most of the canals had been filled in by 1929 to make way for roads. By 1940 the canals and the walkways running by their side had fallen into abject disrepair, the canal water contaminated with trash and debris.This state of affairs continued for the next four decades as numerous proposals to renovate the canals were debated and dropped for both environmental and financial reasons.Thankfully, the reincarnation of the Venice Canals did happen with new walkways and walls being constructed even as the canals were drained and refilled. The canals reopened in 1993 and this has since become an expensive residential area of Los Angeles.Completely removed from the chaos of Venice beach, the canals look beautiful and serene. There are walkways along both sides. Each canal is spanned by two or more picturesque footbridges. While they look similar, no two bridges are exactly the same.The bridges add to the quaint charm of the canals and serve as excellent vantage points to click some beautiful photographs. While the water could be cleaner, the rest of the landscape is restful, simply beautiful.Almost every house on the canals has a tiny pier and some form of kayak or rowboat to navigate the water. We even saw a person who was paddle boarding standing up!The chic houses lining the canals are very well maintained, some with exquisitely manicured gardens and many with comfortable outdoor seating and barbecue arrangements.No two homes are alike and each bears the distinct mark of its owner’s personality. Truly the good life, which I guess is the least you would expect for homes that cost north of a million dollars!While far removed from the boisterousness of Venice Beach, in style the canals too are as distinctly original. Set in the midst of a frenetically busy area, this here is a calm, quiet, serene world with egrets, ducks and pelicans to keep you company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Worth a visit,This is such a unique area that I think every should visit. The canals are very cute and don't take too long to walk around. It is not a far walk from Venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda454
50,Whimsical,What a great find this was for us. So quaint and calming. So close to the beach. Easy walk with plenty of awesome architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tourist780515
40,Interesting and beautiful,Definitely worth checking out while in Venice. Obviously very different and fun to explore. Close to the rest of Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sd7319
50,The Other Venice!,"I don't know how many people even realize there is an entire adorable neighborhood of canals in Venice - most people just think of Venice Beach! What an unexpected find, it really did have the feel of Venice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catiba110
50,Very beautiful!!,Drove thru these and they are amazing! Very beautiful and unique!! Definitely worth the time to stop and see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraycieB
50,Nice Find,"We found this location on our map and were pleasantly surprised. It reminded us of the walks we would take while visiting the Newport Beach, CA area. It is a very clean place and quiet. A great place to relax away from the beach area hustle and bustle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448bobc
30,Picturesque and a great morning walk,"The canals are well laid out and if you end up covering all, it makes for a great morning walk. Overall, the area is quiet and the canals are relatively clean. The houses dotting the canal are worth watching as well - so it is a good walk to take on any day. Make sure to pin your parking location since the canals can throw off your directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730AjayK730
50,Very nice walkway,Venice canals are unique. Very worthwhile and enjoyable walk. Lovely houses and different architecture. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerB4913BL

50,Impossible to miss,You can feel venetian environment thru all the channels and bridges. Architecture all over the place with many different styles coexisting in a amazing ensamble,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirschsandra
40,JUST LIKE THE REAL THING,A great way to feel like you're really in Venice (Italy). There are even little row boats which are similar to those in Italy. The entire area is very reminiscent. Great place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livingstont
40,Very nice place in Venice,"Very nice place in Venice, with a slight romantic air.Great for a late afternoon walk, very quiet and relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernand0ruas
50,Peaceful,"A short walk from the Venice Beach eyesore, the canals provide a very different aspect of the area. Whereas the beach is full of cheap souvenir shops, and a large number of unfortunate folk who are living rough, the canal walks allow you to stroll past lovely homes and watch the ducks and squirrels go about their business. There are several canals and if interested you could easily spend a few hours walking them. A relaxing change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT652
30,Nice oddity but don't make a special trip,Having seen them on a TV show we went to have a look on our way from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach. The area is nice to look at and there are a number of bridges to get the obligatory selfies on. But for me there is nothing outstanding or architecturally significance and not a patch on the real ones. So for me it's a 'been there done that',https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulk226864
50,Canals are quaint and historic,"Beautiful architecture, lovely walking paths through the canals that still exist since. Many have been filled in since They were first built, modeling Venice, Italy. Remember people live here, it is there home so be respectful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OakSpringFarm
30,"This is why there are so many flavors of ice-cream, et alia","I've moved to Venice twice, so there must have been some attraction, now some years ago. Somehow wealthy poseur hipsters have driven the home prices into the stratosphere. But here's what you really get: if you park on the street overnight, there's a high chance of it getting broken into. Just a mile away is a neighborhood where you might get killed in a driveby shooting. The canals are filthy and putrid. The sidewalks everywhere should have been regularly power-washed with bleach. Homeless and psychotic people are everywhere! And the beach itself is so broad and sandy that it's a trudge to get to the actual ocean. I wouldn't live there again for 1/10th the price. -- Oh, there are numerous nice restaurants within a few blocks on Main St. And the Venice beach promenade is an ""entertaining"" circus crush of people, worth seeing once. But go in the daytime where the police are everywhere on bicycles. And I wouldn't really take children there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MediaByte
10,Definitely not somewhere I would return to.,"I was super excited to be seeing the Venice Canals Walkway and was highly disappointed. There are some moments that are picturesque and some lovely homes, most if it just feels dirty and the water is foul. Some areas have quite a lot of trash and the whole area could do with a good scrub if it really wanted to attract tourists. Instagram photos of the area are VERY creative, its generally just dirty and I would never go again. Yuck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Portarlington
50,Delightful hidden gem!,"We had a lovely stroll in this area, really enjoyed the different houses, gardens and canals. Intersting history how it all came about. Also had a few nice chats with some of the people living here. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expatDubai
40,Dreamy place to walk,You feel like you’ve been transported somewhere else when you’re walking along the canals. It’s so beautiful and perfect for a post brunch walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicMoraXO
40,When in Venice...,When visiting Venice you have to see two things. One is Venice Beach. The second is the famous canals of Venice. While touring this area be sure to check out the beautiful homes located on the canals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
40,Great!,If you are in Venice Beach make sure you take a stroll on the walkways. So much beauty to see and lots to do in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
50,Hidden Gem,This is a lovely area to walk in. Must be amazing to live there! The canal area is very small and worth the hour or two of wandering around and admiring the many and varied homes located on the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coddiwompleadventure
40,Poor cousin of Venice,"The Venice canals walkway can be maintained better.It has stagnant water with over grown weeds.A few boats moored to the sides. The houses on either side are much prettier.It was nice to walk from one end to another.If the canal gets cleaned up,it will really be beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xenajay
40,cool to see,"off the beach a bit, nice to walk around and see the pretty homes. i was just in venice so a bit similar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cavb2000
30,A unique little part of Venice - worth a stroll,"Much can be said about this unique little section of Venice. The thing to remember is that it is a stretch of homes you are walking through so I think one needs to recognize that the people living there must be feeling like they are on display at least half of the time. Having said that, it is a nice stroll walking between Marina Del Rey and Venice and you will see some fun and quirky details spread out. Go for sunrise or sunset and benefit from the nice light which will show off the area better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassilis666
10,Not an area I'd visit again..........,"We thought it would be fun and interesting to walk the Venice Canals Walkway. NOT! While there are some interesting and a few beautiful homes along the canal, the canal itself is repugnant. The water was putrid and dirty, some areas of trash. Throughout the walkway, we encountered some interesting characters, bottle in a bag.... The walkways were filthy, looked like they long ago needed a steam cleaning. I'd never recommend going to this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hattie748
40,A little unexpected oasis,"This one pleasure to take in while in the Venice Beach area.A small section of homes away from the beach, between the areas of Venice Beach and Marina del Ray contain a series of watered canals instead of roads. It's a simple grid system and it's a little small, but it quite beautiful.It's a real nice peaceful oasis outside the bussel of cars and foot traffic. Appearances are also real good, as the real estate I am sure is pricey thus contributing to very well kept front yards, excellent walkways and clean surroundings. The water even looks quite nice too, and the little touch of small canoes and kayaks is a nice surprise.It doesn't seem functionally useful for anything, does it connect to a larger body of water? I am not so sure, but what's done or intended purpose is done. It's a nice piece of tranquility that is unexpected, and doesn't take much time to see or get too either. Very worthy stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VADCMDtonian
40,Peaceful getaway,"I've come here a bunch of times and always see something different. It is peaceful and quiet and so I get into a meditative stroll up and down the waterways.Venice's motto is ""keep Venice weird"" and so it attracts a 'weird' element. This leads to Venice being a little loud, colorful, and a place for tourists to get taken for a ride. The canals are quite the opposite. They are still colorful, but they are quiet, and tourists and locals walk around here respectful of the area.Like all of Venice the area is clean, but because of the quietness it feels even cleaner here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashtanganurse
30,Nice houses on the canals,Nice to walk around the canals and see all the different houses. Very quiet area. Worth a visit if you like walking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108

50,A Hidden Gem of Venice Beach,"We walked through the canal walkways on the Sunday of the Abbott-Kinney street festival. If no one had mentioned the canals we wouldn't have known they were there and had a great walk admiring the peaceful scenes of water, bridges, houses and gardens.Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P-4
50,Beautiful tranquil location & close to Farmers Market on (on Fridays).,"Well worth a visit when in the Venice Beach area and if you go on a Friday, the nearby Farmers Market is a great place to pick up some yummy fresh produce.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xplo88
40,Beautiful!!!,"This is a must see. I've been to this area at least three other times and did not know this existed. Great walking through the three to four streets seeing these canals. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Parking is very tricky, especially on warm weekends. I recommend going on a Monday through Friday while school is in session. Also try to arrive early. The bridge walking reminds me of Venice Italy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pepe574
40,quiet way to pass the day,we wanted up and down the canals and relived our youth and reminiss how it has changed since the 60's and 70's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805onthego

50,Beautiful,We walked all along the canels and the views and homes are gorgeus. It is a must visit when coming to Venice. It has a long history and the beauty is breathtaking. It is the perfect stroll first thing in the morning or anytime. We love it everytime we visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDD800
50,I felt like I was on set with Hank Moody,"Loved the houses, all so different but have the same vibe of cosyness to them. This is definitely a must when visiting LA :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhabica
50,It's a must!,Most people never see it.It's quite the contrast from Venice Beach Boardwalk.It's serene and beautiful on a nice day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4288XBdavep
40,Worth a quick look,We didn't walk it but found the whole history and what views we did see interesting. Venice is worth a visit. The good news is there are more hippies than homeless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinH145
40,Lovely homes along the canals,"I had never heard of the canals in Venice, CA until a recent visit. Our friend took us right to a few of the nicest spots and we had a lovely stroll. Many ducks were on the canal or the small docks. There were signs posted about keeping dogs on a leash and being careful to not disturb the nesting ducks. Some of the old, small cottages remain, but most have been replaced by large, new houses. We saw two homes with demolition notices posted. We were able to stroll along walkways by the canals to admire homes and gardens up close. The bridges across the canals make for nice photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyW619
30,Sad,"Some of the canals are beautiful, others are filled with garbage and tents/shelters for the homeless and you can’t see anything but filth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie1fan
40,Off the beaten path,If we were not on a tour we would have never seen this. Very neat to see. If not for our tour guide we would have never known about these. Worth the time to go see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhC1926TM
40,Worth to be seen,"A lot of little canals and beautiful houses. You almost feel like being in Venice, Italy. There are many walking bridges, and so many flowers. Very quiet place compared to Venice, Italy. Has to be seen at least once in your life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gincar2016
50,Walk along the canals,"have been wanting to check out the Venice Canals for a while now and a recent road trip weekend to SoCal seemed like the perfect time to do it! Venice Canals have been in soo many movies, just had to go see them for myself!We arrived right before sunset and it was just beautiful. The way the water reflective everything and the slight breeze. Walking along the canals are peaceful and not too crowded. Sometimes its nice to be off the beaten path and just walk and enjoy the scenery.Abbot Kinney, the developer of Venice, sought to recreate the appearance and feel of Venice Italy, and I have to say it does make you feel like you're away from the busy beach life and transported to another place. Jealous of those who get to call this place home.I can now say I have been to both Venice Canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myorona73

50,Afternoon walk,"Not far from Venice Beach Pier, very elegant and peaceful neighborhood, historic building, fit for small group, family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343qinc
40,Different world from Venice Beach,"Venice Canals are like a different world from Venice beach. Very calm and peaceful. Interesting to walk around and look at all the different homes and gardens. I think it would have been nice to be able to rent canoes or paddleboats, but I suppose the neighbors may not think it would be especially nice. It is an easy walk from the Venice beach area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
50,Hard to Find but Worth the Search,Be sure you carefully follow your GPS because it's harder than you woudl think. It is such a beautiful and unique section of housing that you won't regret making it a priority.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wiertrvl
50,"A magical spot for quiet, contemplative souls","I'm almost reluctant to share about this spot as I wouldn't want it to get spoilt and overrun by tourists, though tourists do already frequent it, but I will, for anybody travelling to Venice who like me is a pretty quiet, nature-loving, meditative, contemplative soul as it is a lovely sanctuary in an otherwise fairly busy place.The canal walkway is a network of streets set along shallow canals. I have never seen a boat actually out on the canals though many of the homeowners have a boat or some sort of floating vehicle (swans and flamingos amongst other things) tied up to the little jetties that line the canals.It's very unique and very different. Venice itself has a very particular Bohemian flavour emphasising art and beauty with lots of little galleries and beautiful, unexpected street art all over the place and I would recommend just wandering around the place as you never know what you will find. The canal walkway carries on that theme but is that bit more serene and secluded and has a truly lovely vibe.There are many small, cute bridges you can stand on and take in the views, or cross over to the other side of the canal to look at whatever interests you and takes your eye.The houses lining the canal are unique, individual and many have interesting art or beautiful-smelling flowers adorning the tiny gardens.At the time of year I was there the whole area was populated by beautiful red butterflies, which were a joy to watch. For me it was a place where my soul felt calm and relaxed and I could spend an hour somewhere quiet just to contemplate or to sit and journal. It would be a dream come true to be able to afford a house there but I did really enjoy visiting and it's a place I will never forget.If you do visit please do so quietly so as not to spoil the vibe for those who live or holiday there and like-minded quiet-seeking visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyvalkyrie22

50,"Interesting real estate, interesting setting","Walked along the ""Grand Canal"" as part of a 'Secret Food Tour."" Did not know that the canals are flooded by sea water at high tide, that properties go for $5M+ (but you've got to be able to stand a constant stream of tourists looking in your front room!). An interesting place for a 'less than hour' walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NH_Joe

50,Very Cool,"As you're walking those loud main streets in Venice and you suddenly make a turn into the canals, you find a complete 180 in noise level and tranquility.

50,Peaceful & quiet walk,"I missed seeing the venice canals last time i stayed in Venice in February. I came here with another woman I met staying at my air B&B and I’m so glad i got to explore this area of Venice. I was going to go on a tour here but its really unnecessary to go on a tour its a lot of walking and taking photos. Its very beautiful the area with picture perfect photos of walking bridges and flowers wildlife etc. It reminded me of Amsterdam and Venice Italy of course but a more quiet tranquil place to walk and enjoy the afternoon,morning or night. I went in the afternoon it was hot and I must say its not a place to swim. However, I did see people standing in the water but I wouldn’t recommend it because water is murky and probably isn’t the best water to swim or get in. I do say this is a must see in the area to experience. There is a duck park there that you can feed the ducks too and a play ground next to it if you have children with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaWorldtravelor
50,Very cool area,"I love this area! Movies have been filmed here and it’s just a really neat vibe. That said, as much as I love walking around here, I’m cognizant that this is in the middle of people’s homes. Please watch out for traffic on the little bridges. And keep noise to a minimum so the area keeps allowing us to walk there. It’s a quite little area tucked back in a chaotic town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimtravelnut
40,Well worth the visit,"We enjoyed our walk through the Venice Canals area. We were there mid-morning so it was quiet and we didn't feel like we were intruding on the homeowners, as some of the other reviewers have felt.

40,Interesting relaxing walk,"Not so far from Venice Beach, you can find this neighborhood with canals, little bridges and quiet environment with some tourist walking around. Not sure I would want to live where people wander around to enjoy the views and quietness, but as tourist it is welcome break from the crowds and noise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DidierNivelles
40,Cute Place for a Stroll,"If you're in the Venice area, this is a nice place for a stroll. It's a pretty and quiet part of the area. The ""canals"" aren't that deep at all. Maybe a foot (depends on rainfall I suppose). The walkways are right alongside the homes which if I lived there might annoy me with all these tourists walking by. Some of the bridges do allow for cars so keep an eye out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyC554
30,Walk This Way to the Walkway,"Nice wee walk looking at the different styles of homes on this Walkway.Calling it a ""canal"" is stretching it a bit, as there was very little water. More algae and weeds, but under better conditions, this would be a good photo op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glasgowbigyin01
30,A good place to walk,"Its a good place to walk if you love walking along with canals. If you have seeing these type of things many times, it is not a place for you to visit. I would think this place is ordinary place, if you are from a place where rich folks stay all around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayan1991
40,Away from the bustle,We wandered the canal walkways very happily for an hour or so and enjoyed looking at the individual homes that line them. A very interesting section of Venice away from the business elsewhere. Recommend that you step off the tourist treadmill and explore this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446grahamh

There are a ton of great picture opportunities on the walkways and bridges with amazing architecture in the houses lining the canals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asafransky
50,Sunday Afternoon Stroll,Walked through the canals with my family. The neighborhood is beautiful and the canals are simply wonderful. Being down here is like being in Europe. This is a wonderful way to stroll away a couple of hours before heading down to Venice Beach for dinner at one of the beach-front restaurants. This is a LA hidden gem and well worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccac623
40,"lovely, peaceful place for a morning walk","We are staying nearby and I needed to walk for an early morning coffee. Very few places are open at 6 am so I had a 10 minute walk. I realized from the map that I was close to the canals and figured out how to walk along them. They were filled with early morning ducks. The sidewalk along the canals was empty and it was really lovely. There isn't much water in the canals, maybe a foot or two deep. There were some jumping minnows in the middle. It was much nicer walking along the peaceful canals than the busy street. Worth seeing them. I'll do it again tomorrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3kidmomsf
20,Not much to see,"The water level was really low, so didn't really look like a canal, more a muddy puddle. Very overrated. Venice was an absolute hole. Never want to go there again. Santa Monica was so much nicer. I didn't see any arty, hippy style people, going about their arty ways. It was just a dump, selling really awful, cheap tee shirts and rubbish. the only arty thing I saw was someone making a sand castle. We were a small, varied group and all of our opinions were the same. Couldn't wait to get back to SaMo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63
40,"Relaxing, out of the grind","This is true history these canals. This city was designed after Venice, IT. I have been to Venice many times but never seen this. It was nice to take a walk. It was restful and quiet. Quite different than the boardwalk. If you like to see something that isn’t over crowded and noisy, this is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexWorldTour
50,A lovely walk...,"This is a lovely area to visit. Worth a trip alone to ogle some of the beautiful houses along the canals! A great spot for a lazy wander with an ice lolly.Be warned that the pavements are very narrow, we tried to go down pushing bicycles but quickly turned back to drop them off as it was not practical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurajtravels88
20,Cheesy tourist attraction,"Yes, its a great photo op and thats about it. You will cross some bridges in a small master planned community with a few gondolas and scenic walkways and there will be lots of people and traffic in your way.

It's fashioned after the venice canals in Italy, with cute pedestrian bridges that lead you along a nice stroll near the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E642MSamyb
40,Beautiful stroll,"Gorgeous place to take a walk and get some photos! Here are my tips if you are planning to go...The canals seemed closer to Marina Del Rey than the Venice Beach/Santa Monica area I am more familiar with. My directions took me through Marina Del Rey and up to the canals, rather than down Venice Beach and to the canals.There is parking lot charging a flat rate of $25 which is great if you plan to spend an entire day around Venice or that area of Marina Del Rey. I found a parking spot in a shopping center and then we walked to the canals. Get there early, park and plan to spend a few hours exploring the area so you don't feel rushed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelloDollface

50,Lovely walking area,"I found that the Venice Canals Walkway was lovely. This is an area that is surrounded by private homes, so please be mindful. That being said, the little canals are gorgeous and I really loved walking around here. If you're passing by it's a great place to visit, however if you're in LA I would not recommend going all the at out to Venice to look at this. If you're in the area, it's a relaxing little walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279ericai

10,"These are PRIVATE HOMES, PRIVATE BOATS","These are private homes, private docks, private boats, that happen to be on a public walkway. Show respect!1-Walk your birds, bikes, boards..there are small children walking on the narrow sidewalks that could easily be injured by your carelessness.2-Dell is a street.. you cannot block it with your car, your self or your selfie stick.3-Professionlal photoshoots require a permit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/967mars
50,Love the place for its relaxed mood,"Of course it is not like Venice in Italy, it is small, and crowded, and people who live there most probably hate every single person who passes in front of their windows, but still it is good to see. It is picturesque and romantic with a few bridges and some houses which are really loveable. I love the green part of Venice - there is plenty of trees and a lot of nice flowers. Also this is a nice stroll for the afternoon. Parking is available on the streets, but be careful there are plenty of patrols very willing to give you a ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac

A great relaxing place near the bohemian beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alipinofw
40,Pleasant Place to Wander,Nice quite place to walk about prior to or after going to the busy beach and boardwalk. Most of the houses are beautifully individualized with each having a unique architectural feel and decorated garden. Never too crowded with a good supply of bridges to take you across the canals into the direction you are aiming for. Parking on the periphery of this residential area is limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barzinji

40,Relaxing Stroll,Looking for a nice stroll inside the hustle and bustle of LA? Walk through the Venice canals. A historic neighborhood lined by canals. Each house is unique and the landscaping beautiful. It is very quiet and lots of ducks and other birds flying around. A good time for 1 - 2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543scotth
50,"""Secret"" Canals are the ""Other"" Venice, CA.","I always ask visitors to LA who mention that they went to Venice if they visited the canals as well. Most often the person looks at me like I'm crazy and says that no he had no idea there was more to Venice than the famous boardwalk area. This restored area in LA is unique as it's so quiet and peaceful with the canals, footbridges and lush landscaping along the canals. I'm sure the residents like the relative dearth of visitors. Yet, anyone who braves the craziness of the boardwalk area deserves the respite to be found by walking through this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Star5497
30,Interesting to know they are there but not what we thought,"Interesting to know the canals here but not what we thought. I enjoyed looking up the history of the canals and the fact that the city was named after Italy's Venice and had actual canals was lost on me. I had wondered why I had not known of the canals before, despite that fact that I had been to Venice a half dozen times over the last few decades. Now I know. I had hoped for a lovely walk along a water side trail or even a gondola down one of the canals. However that was not the options. The canals are basically a neighborhood and not much of an attraction. Good enough just to take a quick drive of bike ride there to go over the 3-4 bridges and then be on your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamytravelsforlife
40,Very pretty,I went here on the last day the beach is lovely with an old pier. Parking is right on the beach at 4 dollars. The canals are set back but lovely and pretty would not think you was in LA definitely worth a visit even if you ride along from Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spice2uk
30,Pretty Oasis in Venice,"I sorta fell into these walkways during a morning run. They are actually sidewalks that surround people's homes.. very lovely and a cool little spot of Venice. I was happy to see them, but I would not have wanted to make a special trip to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennifermq
50,A moment of Tranquility,"Probably one of the most picturesque places to visit in the area. With its beautiful canals and pretty houses this is a great area to walk around, explore the canals and take instagrammable pictures! Don't miss out - you do not find any other place that calming and relaxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegoldenNomad

50,More beautiful than the real venice,"If you're visiting L.A., take a trip down to Venice. It off the main stretch of Venice beach and its extremely exclusive. You can imagine only the wealthy live in this part of town. All the houses are different, their garden's lead down to the canals and its a small village of waterways . The only smell is from the greenery of the exotic plants and shrubs. You can't help but look into the properties as you pass by the open patio doors. It's like walking through a lush film set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissandi
50,Fantastic experience away from the beach,A truly lovely area to visit about a block from the seediness of Venice Beach. Hard to believe people know Venice by the beach when it is in fact the canals that make this place worth a walk. The small house and humped bridges ad to the scene. Well worth a look if you're in the area. Parking is free a few blocks back from the beach too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAK2123

40,Peace and beauty,"Took a walk down from Santa Monica and along Venice Beach, checking out the murals along the way. Venice Canals are tucked away, just nip up 23rd, 25th, or 27th, and you will find the canals. Take in the pretty homes and the waterways as you stroll along. So peaceful. Worth a look at if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4092DEemmac
40,Welcome Calm Respite from the Vibrancy of LA.,"An is plenty to wander around the Canals and take in the peaceful tranquillity of the water & bridges juxtaposed with every conceivable style of colourful home and gardens.

30,Interesting if you're in the area,"When we visited the water level was pretty low making for muddy, somewhat stinky waterways. The homes surrounding the canals however are fun to look at. If you're in the area, it's a nice stroll. Venice Beach has alot more to look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda_Jake
50,BEAUTIFUL,This place is a hidden GEM! I LOVE going here and walking along the canals after a rough day. Being there when the sun is setting or rising is beautiful! Even when the sun goes down it is so calming to walk around the canals ! I haven't been on any tours for the canals but you can definitely walk them yourself and enjoy alone time by yourself or with a loved one! I'm from the east coast and this place is a spot I come to when I'm home sick!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnase9609
50,Strolling the Canals,"The canals are a fun walk on a sunny day, best done on the weekday when it is not over run by tourists. From the beach on Grand Canal, they span the area between Washington Blvd and South Venice Blvd., however, the canals perpendicular to the ocean start roughly at 26th Street if you are walking from the beach. And only go in as far as Eastern Court. Yes, a very quaint area of lovely homes: some massive ones and others still the charming beach shacks they once were.When visiting the area, please be mindful of the noise you may create when walking/talking by the houses. As one who used to live on Linnie Canal, I heard more than I wanted to of the conversations people were having as they walked past! Other than that, enjoy your stroll, and do not feed the ducks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/little_traveller
40,Walking Through Venice,"What fun this was. We knew that this was a miniature recreation of the canals in Venice and that they had fallen on hard times. But they have recovered and are a very pleasant place to walk and enjoy the water. We saw people canoeing, we saw others tending their shrubbery and we heard lottos people working on their homes. A very pleasant walk through the canals",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
40,It's Not Ancient History,If someone wants to know the history of Los Angeles and the beaches then a walking or a driving tour of the Venice canals will stimulate the imagination. How could a guy think of making this area an Italian paradise? It was an interesting try and with the canals that are left you will see a different way of life for the residents who have chosen to live on one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MITCHELN
40,Not the real Venice but really nice,If you're nearby Venice Beach you must do a walk of the canals Walkway ... it's nowhere near the real Venice but still it's amazing and relaxing ad you'll get to spot some amazing villas over the canals! Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MassimoCw
40,"It was once MUCH larger, but kinda fun just to see it all...","I live in LA...and I like taking out-of-towners to see the canals. At the turn of the century, it was SO MUCH more extensive, and much more impressive... But, you do get just a glimpse of how funky an area it is... Totally out- of- place in today's world...The surrounding area is nothing to write home about. Parking in Venice is almost ALWAYS a chore. But, like any beach town you'd expect that.. I'd say ""SURE"" go see it once, and then hit the Venice boardwalk for people watching and some out door food...WHY NOT???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagreek1
30,Cool! But when the water is low it is a bit unpleasant,this is a cool network of houses and canals. The houses have a fishbowl effect...you can look in them and see what people were doing which is kinda fun to see how they are living.The water was low all over the region and in the canals though and that made them kinda smelly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452lesliee

50,An Italian Escape Right Here in LA,"This is an area of LA few but the locals know about - and it is fabulous! Built in the 1950’s and modeled after the famed actual canals of Venice, Italy, the small 5-6 small street area is lined with small boats, canoes and gondolas that the locals use to get around. (The story goes that the local City Council agreed to let Venice flood the areas to create a Sister “floating city” - and then ran out of money! So this is all that remains). Walk around the million dollar mansions, up and down the tiny circular bridges for some exercise, catch gorgeous views of sunset, and feel like you left LA! BONUS tip: grab dinner at one of the fab restaurants on nearby Washington Boulevard and then walk off some dinner w a beautifully lit stroll around the canals. GORGEOUS anytime, but especially at Christmas and during the longer, lazy summer days to watch the sun go down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354dorothys

30,Nice Homes and Photo opportunities,"Firstly, be aware that you are walking around people's home yard and you have the ability to look into other's home. Do respect the privacy and becareful when taking photos; ask permission if the owner is at their backyard, it's only polite to do so!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriStupe
40,Canal Exploration of Succulants,A nice break away from the crazy of Venice Beach and only a short walk to get here. It is another world of calm after the hectic waterfront. Nothing spectacular but a pleasant place to explore and stroll. My wife particularly enjoyed the HUGE and varied succulent gardens that many of the houses had on display if you are a plant buff. Worth a visit if you have an hour to kill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath
40,Nice place for a stroll and to take some pics,"We've wanted to visit the canals here on a couple of previous trips to LA, but never made it. We had a nice walk around talking pics and recognising places from movies/TV shows and felt like I was in an episode of Californication! :-) It's a residential area so obviously you can't be too intrusive but i reckon they're used to people walking about and photographing their houses! There is parking on the main street to then be able to wander over and spend half an hour strolling about in the sunshine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SelinaCee
50,Relaxing canals on LA's west side.,"Such a calm place to visit, especially if you've never been. But this was my 3rd or 4th time. Nice to look at the bridges, homes, and little row boats.

50,Worth visiting!,"While my boyfriend was visiting me in LA, I kept trying to plan things for us to do. It being his 3rd visit, I was running out of some creative ideas. A friend brought this to my attention as something that could be really fun and romantic to do with your significant other.My story: We arrived to the venice canals just in time for the sun to set. It was the perfect atmosphere. We took a stroll up and down the canals and looked at the beautiful homes and swan boats. Finally as we were about to call it a day, we saw a man taking pictures of some other people in a perfect spot with the sun setting behind them on the water. Due to my love of pictures, I had asked him if he minded taking a picture for myself and my boyfriend. Immediately he replies, I am actually a wedding and engagement photographer, I would love to take some pictures for you! Boy did we luck out. About 10 minutes and 55 photographs later, we ended up with some pictures that will last a lifetime. It is the perfect backdrop for a picture of you and your special someone.Highly recommend for the view, the sunset and some great photographs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/east0ne
50,Great place to walk along paths! Nice vibe with great scenery! Cool houses!,We were riding bikes down threw Venice and found these cool canals in between luxurious houses and condos.

30,File under nice oddity not a tourist attraction.,If you accidentally walk into this all well and good have a look see if you'd like to live in any of the houses beside the canal and that's it. This is not the eighth wonder of the world or even the eighth wonder of Los Angeles. The highlight of your visit will probably be seeing a few ducks. Enter at Washington Blvd and Strongs Drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB

40,Nice Walk,I've been going down here for years and it dawned on me I'd never really took a stroll along the canals. So recently finally got around to it. It's cool to wander along. The canals were pretty depleted in the water department when I was here. Makes it seem little rundown and ancient. I imagine when the canal levels are higher it's pretty cool. Must be nice to live right along them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms

50,Funky Venice Canals are Fascinating,"Funky Venice Canals are fascinating. Not far from the beach and definitely something not found in Iowa.

50,A free and interesting place to see in Venice--and the reason the city was named,"I was taking my friend to the airport but we had enough time for one last tourist spot. She was surprised by it and I told her it was originally much larger. It's more interesting to know the history, that Abbott Kinney was trying to recreate Venice Italy. You'll see every style of house and can park for free on the streets nearby. Just make sure you note where you've parked because you can get turned around if you go through all the canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
50,A lovely place to take a walk,"I love walking the Venice Canals. It is a charming experience. You will walk up and over the canals- you will see lovely homes (some large and new and modern, and some small bungalows) - and you will see ducks in the canals and on the sidewalks. There is a nice little playground for small children which also has a duck pond in it.It is located between Venice Blvd. and Washington Blvd. in Venice, not far from the beach.It is also fun to drive over the canals on the elevated bridges. It is a highlight of your trip to see the Venice area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaDi
50,The nicest thing you could see in Los Angeles,"What a beautiully hidden retreat, we were overwhelmed by the beauty of the Venice Canal Historic District. Paths line the waterway allowing visitors to see the increible homes, owned mostly the creatives, and there's a surprise around every corner.The area was built in 1905 by tobacco pioneer Abbot Kinney as part of his plan to bring Italian Venice to America hence the waterway and one-time presence of gondolas.Look out for features in the gardens and boat parks that include a giant gorilla in the center of a love heart and a pink flamingo barge!Venice Canals are a perfect way to relax and escape the hustle and bustle of the city, allow around an hour to stroll through and enjoy the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtwmagazine
50,A wonderful place to wander in Venice,"I have been here numerous times and I never get tired of walking these walkways. It is so peaceful, serene and beautiful, compared to the noise and activity along Venice Beach. It can get crowded especially in the summer, so would avoid this time of year or go early in the morning or late afternoon. I'm not sure how the homeowners feel about having hundreds of tourists walk their community, but I love looking at the housing and am envious that they get to live at such a unique place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryL1334
50,Hidden Gem,"You blink and you'll miss them, but a total escape from the crazy LA lifestyle. Gorgeous place to take photos. If you're lucky (like I was) you'll meet some people who live on the canal and get a nice boat ride around this hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5625MKsamanthas
40,A wild ride,"From musicians to roller skaters to head shops to Muscle Beach, this is quintessential southern California street life. A melange of sensory experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unsatisfiedguest2013
50,Hidden gem,Venice canals is a beautiful place to walk around. Located at the back of the beach along a walkway. It is a quaint peaceful area full of boutique homes overlooking the canals with pretty fauna and bridges. Small boats are moored up to some of the houses which I must say look idyllic. We did encounter a group of security men who had a guy on the floor and who was under arrest for I guess breaking and entering? We diverted our route from a possible crime scene and enjoyed hidden corners and pathways. A lovely place to jog or enjoy a romantic walk. Seems a world away from the buzz of Venice and the beach just a short walk away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandap994
40,A beautiful walk,"Doesn't have the romance and history of the ""real"" Venice but it is a very appealing part of LA and a lovely walk. A far more interesting part of the town than downtown to enjoy variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
50,Beautiful,"The Venice Canals are beautiful. Having been to the real Venice, it is a different vibe than the Canals here but it is still beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsthetravelguy
40,Right From the Movies,Very eclectic area with numerous types of homes. Quite the high societal place to be. The canals are shallow so none of the boats can have motors. Find a place to park on the main drag to the south of the canals. It’s worth a visit if you’re in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrish77
40,Exciting walk,"Venice Canals Walkway is very nice for a short walk of less one hour. The houses around the Canals are so variously: fancy, luxury, sometimes odd but always in a good shape and renovated with passion and love to details. A very splendide area to live.Marcello M. Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcello345
50,A Beautiful Walk with Friends,We read about the canals and the community and couldn't wait to do the walk. The houses were incredible and most were beautifully landscaped. Going over the bridges of the canals were fun but it was the quiet walk in these surroundings that made it very special. We didn't see any big tour groups of people. It was pleasant. It's even better when you learn about the history of the canals before you go. It gives you an appreciation of the vision of this planned community. We had the weird and noisy time at Venice Beach boardwalk and finished with this serene walk. Perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CultureLush
50,An Interesting Area,"It's hard to believe this unique little upscale area is only a few blocks away from bum central (i.e. the boardwalk). This was another bucket list item I wanted to check off this trip. Many of us have seen the canals at least once in some Hollywood movie, and I wanted to check them out to see it is person. It was actually better than advertised IMHO. There is not much to see, and you are better to park and walk the couple of block area so you can see the unique houses along the canal. Plenty of people out walking their dogs and running around the area.It only takes you a few minutes of your time, but rewarding if you like that kind of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel

50,"Historical, unusual, lovely","The Venice Canals...CALIFORNIA!? It's great right? Wild, right!? I live in Santa Monica and visiting the canals never gets old for me. Abbott Kinney...visionary, perhaps madman? Who knows! But he had passion and vision and just up and built some canals a la Venice Italy! It is charming and fun to visit. Remember to respect the privacy of the people who live here. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
40,Just a nice residential area,"A nice place to visit, go for a walk, quiet, relaxed, interesting to see how some people in LA live. Anyway, it does not remind of Venice at all, it seems like the boats are only a decoration, so if you expect anything that remotely is close to Venice - don't. But it is a nice place anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaismalli

50,An LA must,"The small man-made Venice canal quarter is an LA must-see. Nice wooden houses, some gardens, a quiet oasis close to crazy Venice Beach, all reminiscent of what used to be a laid back hippy area (now I imagine the number of the price tags on those properties to be quite long). Unfortunately, the draught causes the canals to have a lower water level with not-so-fresh water at times :( Still nice though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scarbez
50,Peeping Allowed,"Just a short walk from the Venice pier (see picture-a great place to view the bay and SM pier) are the famed Venice Canals, a small enclave and remnant of the work of architect, Abbott Kinney. Here you walk among the original cottages and mega-mansions of this unique West LA neighborhood. In addition, you will explore diverse botany and architectural design. Birds are also plentiful so don't wear your dress shoes. Be sure to do some bridge hopping and if someone invites for a small boat ride, take them up in it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandCRTravelers

50,Venice California Style.,"Having visited the canals in previous visits this time we were able to stay in one of the properties; it was magical. The canals are a tranquil area just a short walk away from the liveliness of Venice Beach and also the shopping opportunities of Abbot Kinsey Blvd. The canals are lined by attractive houses and gardens, the attractive bridges crossing the canals, the colours of the flowers and the palm trees all add to the charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennyl478
40,Quiet walk in Los Angeles,A pleasant pocket in LA to get away from the traffic and shopping and tourist traps. If you like to walk and talk this is as good a place as any in this odd neighborhood of bridges and canals. Some nice pictures to be had here on a sunny day.Parking off the canals is a hassle so it's best to try two blocks away near Washington Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hyperrreal
40,Easy and close walk to the beach,"The canals are a must see if you're headed to the beach at Venice. It's a very fun, relaxing stroll and it's somewhat tucked away so you don't feel any hustle and bustle from the beach crowds. The houses are also very beautiful to walk past and look at.Don't skip it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PH2003
50,Never knew these existed!!,This you have to see. Beautiful homes line the canals. It's a residential area which has walkways along the homes and over the canals. The homes are all on top of each other but it's really neat to see their individuality in both décor and landscaping. Its a nice way to pass an hour before you hit the boardwalk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jkarr11

50,Little known gem.,Found out about this treat by accident. It's really delightful. One interesting sight along the walkway is a home that has about a million different oddities and dolls. You'll laugh yourself silly. The walk around the canals is very pretty. Not sure if they have gondola rides but have heard that they do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/care558
50,Venice in the States,"Need a Gondola or Gondoliere in Los Angeles? Need a Canale? U got it! Meds Ponte dei Sospiri? Ok, folks, Venice is in Italy. But kitching along the channel in gondola a Los Angeles is funny and shows u how much Americans do believe in our history. They realize they do not have history but they want to know everything about it. So they try to be cosmopolitans. However. And so immerse y'self in a different Venice surrounded by nature and buildings. Close your eyes, open'em up suddenly. What difference does it make if your fantasy's engine is functioning?

40,Fun to do while in Venice,"The canals are indeed a ""hidden gem"" but I wouldn't make a separate trip just for this. It's a nice walk and house-gazing is very fun, but that's about it.

40,Not THE Venice,"Subdivided in the early 20th century, originally small single family houses on a half dozen canals, with a central business agora behind the beach. Now pricey residential. Sidewalks along the canals in front of the homes and over the bridges allow visitors to dream about their waterside dwellings. Anyone can paddle through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO
40,Not enough time,Sadly we had to time to walk 30' enjoying the houses and views of the channels. But we enjoy the little time we had. Take more time please!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jorgesT4959VW
50,Venice Canal: Awesome stroll (TIP/ADVICE for visiting),"Great place to stroll, take a leisurely walk. We went here before the beach and strolled the 5 canals. They aren't long, but it's nice to see the houses along the canals. Some are old school, some are more modern. Nice colors. They do have security patrolling it so you feel safe (rest of town has an issue with homeless people).TIP: These are all homes, it's not a place to shop or eat if that's what you were intending.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucep460
50,Beautiful afternoon stroll,"Visiting LA with the family, we made it a point to see the canal walk and the unique houses that are there. I LOVED it. Everything about it is so charming and the area is actually quiet. The houses were amazing and the bridges gave you wonderful photo opportunities. The teenagers in our group were not as impressed...I don't think they appreciated how unique it was. They went along with me and posed for some pictures but I think the adults liked it more. It's a hidden gem and I would visit again for sure!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flygirl1993
40,Away from the hustle and bustle of the ocean front,"Scenic and very different from the highlife of the boardwalk, but very small. It's worth the detour.

50,Best Kept Secret,"I am amazed at how many people do NOT know about this hidden treasure in LA, walking distance to the Venice boardwalk, pier and beach. There are no hotels on the canals, just multi-million dollar homes with small canoes and kayaks attached which no one seems to use. You will not be disappointed if you find an Airbnb, like I did, to stay in - worth the extra $. You can walk over foot bridges that connect the 3 islands. You can easily also walk to Washington Blvd. and Pacific Ave. for shops and restaurants. I used Uber/Lyft for the first time on this trip and got everywhere from the canals usually for under $6. There is plenty of bustling, crowded activity in LA, Santa Monica, Marina del Rey - why not have your peaceful, beautiful place to go back to. If you stay somewhere else, make sure to at least pay a visit to the Venice Canals. You will temporarily feel like you are in Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lescha

40,Enjoy a quaint walk on the canal to brighten your day.,"Few settings have appeared in movies more often than the Venice canals. Of course, there's a reason -- it's absolutely beautiful.

40,Interesting area for a relaxing walk,"The Canals near Venice Beach are unusual - it's a number of homes built on canals, with most having a dock to the canal.

Fun as a diversion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottesandiego

40,Interesting History of Venice,"Our grandsons (14 & 17) wanted to see the sights of Venice Beach so we included walking the canals. One of our grandsons is interested in architecture, so this was of particular interest to him. Our July 4th outing was crowded on the beach, but walking the sidewalks along the canals was peaceful with few tourists. There is quite a variety of architectural styles of all ages of homes. The boys liked picking their favorites and taking pictures of them. On one of the bridges over a canal, we got a great family picture taken by a volunteer tourist. While this was not an exciting adventure, we all enjoyed the change of pace from the beach and were glad that we took the time to see a different part of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII

40,Worthwhile a stroll,"Coming from Europe and knowing the real Venice in Italy, it was kind of 'weird' to discover this Venice.But the idea of wanting to copy the real Venice is quite amazing and I found it attractive enough to take a walk over there.There are some nice spots, bridges and colourful houses.So going there for a walk and 'play the tourist', as part of a larger visit of the region, Santa Monica, the Eames Foundation, some Frank Gehry buildings in the area, etc is quite ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
50,Surprised and delighted by this charming enclave,"Reeling from a tourist-induced anxiety-ridden afternoon, I was delighted by the Venice Canals Walkway. The charming enclave is Venice's gem, second only to the ocean itself. A must see for any visitor, particularly those who enjoy the wide variety of plants and architecture the area has to offer. Accessible on Dell road, there are eight parking spaces at the end of the street where Dell meets Venice Boulevard. Get out and walk - you'll be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jencolvin
50,Charming and Really Neat,"Walked through as a shortcut, tide was out, was fun watching the birds, every house is different in its own way and the floral scenery is amazing. Went through again, went over bridges and walked most of it, tide was in this time, just adds that extra charm. watch out for the hippo ! (its only a paddle boat, but too funny)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyhG8875QV

Authentic, stylish charismatic houses with a canal view It was beautiful. It is a well-hidden spot that allows you to walk for a nice quiet walk and just take in the amazing experience. We brought our bikes expecting to be able to ride along the canal, but unfortunately, it was a little too narrow, but that didn't matter as the place was too mind blowing to even care. I will definitely be visiting again. I love LA but it definitely didn't feel like I was in LA here.

40,An amazing little gem in Venice,"The canals are downright gorgeous! If you're looking to get away from the crowds of Venice right by the ocean, then this is a nice little stroll where it's much quieter.

50,Beautiful and somewhat hidden gem in Venice Beach,"The Venice Beach Canals span for just a few blocks, so you might not even see them if you don't locate them in a map in advance. But we made a point on stopping there first before we even headed out to the beach, as we were so eager to find and photograph that gem in this neighborhood. The paths around the canals are narrow, but we saw folks in bikes, however walking is much more pleasant. I was surprised to see how close you get to people's homes and even have an insight on interior decor going on in the area. The landscape is full of trees and flowers, which conveys completely different feel from the beach boardwalk. Definitely a great spot for pictures and lasting memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ines_Lamkey

30,There's not really much to see.,"The canals are hidden amongest a quite suburb and can be viewed from the many little bridges criss-crossing over the canals for the access of traffic.

50,So Peaceful!,"It's hard to believe that just a short walk from the colour and noise of Venice Beach is this peaceful gem. How lucky are people to live here!

30,OK walking tour of overpriced homes on the canals,"Some of the homes you walk past are cute and eclectic, but most are new out-of-proportion tear-down remodels squeezed onto these tiny lots.

40,Nice route for your leisurely walk,Enjoy a stroll through the canals on the west side.

40,Glad we made time to see this,"All three days we were in Venice Beach were very foggy so we didn't get to enjoy the beach and instead headed inland.

50,Charming hidden gem.,"Lots of people don't know there are canals in Venice. I lived in LA 10 years before I discovered them. They are so charming to walk through. You can explore for 30 mins and be satisfied with the cute yards, attractive homes and back yards and occasional wildlife spotting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarafix
50,A Hidden Surprise in LA,"Despite its name, it really was a surprise to discover blocks of diverse houses along canals right in LA. The lack of master planning has led to a wildly broad range of homes and landscaping, all linked by paths and arched bridges. Strolling along the pedestrian paths near homes is a relaxing, architectural treat, especially at quieter hours of the day.As someone else said, it might not merit a special trip, but if you are in the vicinity, it is well worth exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanPok

40,Photogenic,"This is a beautiful spot to check out if you're in the Venice Beach area. I wouldn't necessarily say it's worth a special trip if you're coming from outside the Venice area.We found the eastern edge of the canals (furthest away from the ocean) to be the most beautiful area. Our vacation rental was just two blocks away from this place, so it was a convenient site to see.Walking over the bridges reminded me of many scenes from Californication!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/product-of-canada

40,Peaceful and beautiful,My daughter and I rented bicylces to ride down a very busy bike path from Santa Monica Pier. We found the Canals and walked our bikes through many of the paths. It was a bit difficult with bikes. We maybe should have got a chain and locked them up and just walked around without them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH1100
50,Beautiful,"These canals are beautiful. It's very quiet where you can see ducks and beautiful houses along the way.

50,Enchanting!,"Such a unique and enchanting experience, the Venice Canals Walkway had to be one of our favorite activities during our recent visit to the Los Angeles area. Located near the vibrant Venice Beach, the canals are a serene, hidden gem (located off 25th street/Venice Beach) – if you didn’t know they were here, you would easily miss them. I find it hard to believe that we had visited Venice Beach so many times over the years and missed the canal walk. There are five canals - each with unique, charming and/or lavish houses lining the canals. Most of the houses, in absolutely pristine condition, have a dock and a boat. It is simply stunning – would love to live along the canals but a tad out of my price range. The bridges spanning the canals are also unique – none seem to be the same. Would have loved to have seen the original Kinney concept prior to 1928 (when all of the original canals were filled in except the 5 remaining today) – I imagine it was absolutely gorgeous. A great escape from the chaos of Venice Beach – highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60

50,A Day in Venice,"My sons took me on a ""Day in Venice"" excursion which included a nice walk along the canals. I would highly recommend a walk along the canals if you want to get a feel for how these folks in Venice live and enjoy the great weather and scenery. Also walk along Abbott Kinney and shop at the various unique boutiques and check out the restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicahV2625LC
40,A very pleasant stroll,"The canals are not large or a major tourist draw, but instead are a pretty and sometimes whimsical glance at a unique slice of life in So. Cal. You stroll along walks and bridges that abut the backyards of homes along the canal. It was nice to get away from the crowds and tour this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begreen
50,Fell in love with this place,"Well, if this ""Venice"" is so charming and romantic, I'd definitely like to visit the real Venice :) This area is not that big, so it's not worth coming here only for this place. But I advice you to spend here 30 mins to take great pics and enjoy beautiful cozy houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiag394
40,An enchanting walk among unique houses nestled among canals,"We must have visited during high tide on Sunday, January 29th as we did not notice any bad smells. We’re from Canada and I found walking along the canals enchanting. Every house is unique. Beautiful and so quiet early morning with a few other people jogging or walking their dogs. We even saw a policeman on a bike go by. Granted you wouldn’t probably spend more than 30 minutes walking around, but why miss this when it’s so close to Venice Beach? After admiring the houses and choosing which one we’d live in, it was a short walk down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib981
40,So this is why it's called Venice,"Very cool, the history of Venice and the charm of the walk ways. My son brought me here and I had no idea how involved it really is. Houses are unique and interesting. The water doesn't look the greatest and area's are run down. But, overall it's worth a walk and an interesting piece of California History",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessalovestravel

20,beautiful walk,nothing to do there but walk up & down & eat at a few restaurants there - saw some ducks and it's all residences - if those all turn into restaurants & gift shops it'll be worth going - the city can zone it mix used - like in singapore - downstair business & up stair residence - there are such pockets all over la & building more & more - solve traffic problem - no car - just lift or escalator to work - offices should have shifts like grocery stores so there never be jam anywhere anytime,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgram2016
50,"California's answer to Venice, Italy","I'm not a California native, so when I saw the canals for the first time, I finally realized why it was called ""Venice"" Beach. There aren't too many canals, so it won't take very long to walk through a fascinating, sunny, green version of Venice, in contrast to the cobblestone streets and Renaissance architecture of its namesake. Although it is a residential area, I like that the public can come and enjoy the beauty of the Venice Canals as well. If you've already been to the beach, the canals are a nice break from the boardwalk crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannelle01
30,Avoid Venice Canals at low tide,"I decided to visit Venice canals having fallen in love with Venice from my first honeymoon.this was very different from Venice.Unfortunately, we reached there during low tide and it was obvious that there could not be much ""boating"" during the time. There was also a slight stench from the river. However, the whole place did have a different vibe from LA. You almost forgot that there were any land transportation as cars were out of sight. We saw people jogging there, walking the dogs.I guessed that we were the only tourists in the area. However, there were nice deco due to Christmas. There were also few charming houses with nice coats of paint / architecture.After walking for 30 minutes, the kids got kinda ""tired"" and we turned towards Venice Beach instead. Overall, a place that you can miss if you do not have the time. I recommend to visit Venice, Italy instead. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkobog
30,nice thing to do while down in venice,"I think the canals are nice, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't go out of my way to cross through LA to get there. If you plan on going to Venice beach anyway, why not add this little walk to the list. It stretches about 4 blocks close to the beach and you can go in, walk around a bit and take some pictures. I would say about 30min is enough, if you like to walk all of it, maybe an hour at the most. The most interesting part for us was seeing the cute little homes and their great gardening ideas in small spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jesena

40,A walk to Remember!,"Most people head to Venice Beach while in the area. Many don't realize this little gem of a place is very close by. Just a few square blocks you can spend an hour or more leisurely walking up the hills or along the water. There are beautiful private residences along the water. The only issue is parking. Since it is a residential neighborhood and not an ""attraction"" per se, there is no parking lot specific to the site. You may have to pay to park at a private lot in the area and walk there. That was the only hassle....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4GTravels

The houses are an eclectic collection of different architectures, no two looked alike. Lots of pretty gardens. We did kinda feel like we were traipsing though people's front yards though I'm sure the residents are used to it. We got a few friendly waves as we admired the homes. A great place for an early morning stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotc327
30,It's okay,"It's a nice little area in LA but I wouldn't plan your day around it. Take some photos, maybe go for a short walk, it's okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
50,Ahhh! Venice and still in the USA!,Absolutely worth the trip! The canals and each bridge crossing makes one experience magic. A 360 view happens and a feeling of joy is felt deep within. Venice Beach never felt so nice and is within walking distance to all of the shops too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLAP_11
50,A different side to LA,"A beautiful, quaint, peaceful, artistic, tranquil, out of the way community. We enjoyed walking around the interconnecting channels across bridges – some with Christmas decorations up. Every house is unique, hinting at the personality of the owner. I'm sure during the summer, it could be very busy, but in December - this is definitely a side of LA that seems to be hidden away from the hustle and bustle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969suziea
40,Nice little walk,"This was a beautiful setting and great to walk around but I felt like I was intruding, you are mainly looking at peoples houses which are a lot closer to the canal than I'd expected and it's not as far to walk as I'd thought either so I'd allowed a lot more time than needed but it's very pretty to see and I'm glad I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbiesE7874GP
50,Surreal!,"Such a nice place to walk around with excellent photo-op. Just near the Venice beach, the canals lined by beautiful thematic houses with some floating platforms and figure boats.

50,Most people don't even know it is there,"You need your GPS or an in-the-know Angeleno to find the canals of Venice. Originally designed and dredged in 1905 by the developer Abbot Kinney (for whom a near-by street is named that you really must see). Kinney dreamed of beautiful homes on both sides of the many canals with unusual bridges crossing them. That was before cars took over LA and about twenty years later, most of the canals were filled in creating instant streets. But, enough of them still exist to get the flavor and feeling of what was - and still is, in part. That remaining part is truly gorgeous. You can see REALLY expensive homes as you walk along both sides of the canals. The owners seem to accept the tourists and the gawkers who likewise tend to give the owners some ""space"" (and let's face it, courtesy is essential here). Kayaks are still paddled here, ducks still swim by, the chance to stroll along the edges and across the bridges, hints at what once was. It is more than worth seeking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avimagid
40,An ideal place,Visited the Venice Canals Walkway in the last week of December 2016. The houses around the canal walkway were beautifully decorated due to Christmas and New Year celebrations. Few boats could be seen. It is an ideal place for stroll. It is near the Venice Beach. Houses glittering with light looked very beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshwaniC
30,"Nice, but dirty","Very nice ""mimic"" of the actual Venice Canals. When the tide is out though it exposes all of the filth sitting on the bottom which ruined the experience; not something that can be helped, but try to go during high tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blakeherbert
40,Pretty quiet spot,"It's hard to believe few people come here for a walk. It's very pretty, and at Christmas especially. Would recommend for a break away from the hectic business of the beach. But watch out for dog poo!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905jennic

20,So over rated,Only went because of the movie Valentine's Day and wow what a let down. It was like swamp water that smelt like urine and while there were some nice houses others had derelict back yards that looked like something straight out of mt Druitt (Aussies know what I mean). There was rubbish in the water and sunken run down kayaks. Also a few houses tented up getting fumigated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766christinal
40,This is what So Cal is about. The Canals are the soul of the community,A must see for tourists or locals who have not been here before. It is the soul of the area and a welcome contrast to the high energy of the Venice boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144sidm

50,Unique neighborhood ideal for walking,"We used to live near the Venice Canals and would not miss a return visit to them every time we're in the area. These narrow canals are all that is left from developer Abbott Kinney's vision of a holidaymaker's Venice in the city of Los Angeles. Houses range from funky shacks to rebuilt swanky homes. Combine this with a walk along the ocean, and you've had a real L.A. Beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bagan
50,New year trip,"This place is unique! I really enjoy walk true the bridges and contemplate each beautiful houses over there. Look for the public parking, is $10 for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annemaryw2016

50,Quiet and lots of beautiful sea birds,"Get an ice cream at Coldstone and walk the canals, enjoying views of lovely and interesting homes and the varied sea birds.

50,Pretty Area,This was one of the nicest walks we did in Los Angeles. If you are going to be in the Venice beach area anyway it's only a five minute stroll from the beach front. The area is very quiet and a pretty area to wonder around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1954Elizabeth
50,In & out of people's backyards....,"Take a trip around the Venice Canals Walkway - it's very interesting and a fun way to meet locals - you almost feel like you are in their backyard sometimes.

Pretty houses and pretty streams, and really nice place to take a nice stroll after wandering around venice beach. Worth taking a little detour for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LianaE_13
50,A hidden gem in the big city.,"I found this in my favorite local book Walking LA. While only 9 of the original 27 canals still exist and they are so shallow you could probably walk across them, what I love is the uniqueness as well as no traffic while walking along the front of the homes. There is quite a variety of home styles and sizes on tiny lots and some of the yards are unique. The bridges over the canals are all different from each other. It is just a beautiful and interesting walk away from the busyness of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visited49

The canals are beautiful and peaceful, it's a nice break from downtown LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alli_sun_t
20,Low waterline and dirty waters,"We had a stroll through the venice canals expecting so much more than what we saw.The water line is really low, there is algae in the water and the houses around the canals were just not in great condition.The attraction is nice to see, but don't expect to be WOW'd by it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielspada
40,An American version of the Italian city with the same name,"The last remaining Venice Canals are located off 25th Street in Venice Beach. If you didn’t know they were there you would easily miss them. But don’t. Strolling the historic myriad of waterside trails and small bridges is a dreamy way to while away a sunny afternoon.Here you will find relatively newly built design house side by side with the more bohemian housing facilities.Expect, however, no great boat traffic on canals",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13

50,Tranquil Walk,It was a cool day and we enjoyed a leisurely stroll down the canals. The houses and courtsyards are so pretty. We could imagine hosting an evening dinner party in the courtyard on one house.. We considered knocking on the door on more than one lovely residence....we thought we could ask if we could be there friends for just a couple of days...to experience what they live each day. We wondered...where do they park? Is supermarket shopping just a real pain and so eating out every day is just the thing to do? We loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeR34
40,A Peaceful Walk,A very nice place to walk around. The area many years ago was much larger. This is all that remains of the canals. It's fun to walk around and look at the lovely homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorRetired

50,A great walk just off the beach,"We stumbled upon the walkway by accident when riding along the beach, there was a point where we had to detour when the path ran out so decided to take some of the back streets - so glad we did.

50,"Quiet, Quirky!","This is a bit out-of-the way place, but one that was especially fun for two reasons: 1) I had just finished watching the show Goliath, and the canals are featured in the location, and 2) it was Halloween week - and some of these people go all out! I loved seeing the skeletons and spiders on the roofs and cobweb decor - what fun! I imagine it is that way around most of the holidays - you can tell the everyday homes with kids from the weekend adult playhouses. It's a popular dog-walking spot, so be prepared t for occasional odors or doggie disagreements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuePete
40,Fun to Explore While Walking in Venice,We stayed at an airBnB house in Venice during our Los Angeles stay. I had lived in L.A. for 7 years prior to moving to the Philippines and had been to Venice Beach but never the canals. So it was a new experience for me as well as my girlfriend who was visiting the US for the first time. We really enjoyed walking along the canals. The homes and landscaping there are an attraction in themselves...very eclectic and all different from each other. It's a nice way to spend the afternoon and then you can walk the short distance to the beach to watch the sunset like we did. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephJean47

40,Relaxing and unique,"The last time we were in LA, we only drove up to a couple of the area canals in Venice and were disappointed that we didn't have enough time to stroll around and take in all the beautfy and charm. We had a lovely visit this time, biked around here and stood on all the bridges, walked on the pathways, admired the houses and cuteness of the area. Makes one forget about the city. We found it relaxing and peaceful. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
40,Charming Area,"Historic district in Venice, CA built by a ""dreamer"" who wanted to replicate the waterways of the original Venice in Italy. While many of the original canals have been paved over by the City, there are still 9 canals to enjoy walking on their bridges and viewing the charming and eclectic houses that surround this charming area. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulcB6604SH
30,A neighborhood with canals...,"I recently discovered the Venice Canals Walkway but wasn't overly impressed with the area. Yes, the neighborhood has some interesting houses built along canals. It's not too busy because it's off the beaten path of the shoreline promenade. If you've already wandered up and down the beach, I don't recommend walking further inland to see the area. It is interesting to see but I wouldn't make an extra effort to see it. Instead, enjoy the beaches of Venice and the neighboring communities up and down the shore.Note: Venice Beach may be iconic but be aware of your surroundings. I don't recommend visiting the canals later in the evening as this is a residential neighborhood. I definitely don't recommend visiting Venice Beach after dark as it is a bit sketchy at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
50,Famous but Not Busy,"Certainly the Venice canals of Santa Monica are well known, but we were surprised how few people we found walking them. Many interesting houses dot the shores and it's worth visiting.

40,Nice change to the beach walks,What a lovely area. Beautiful houses. It's probably best not to visit on a Sunday like we did! It was very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/midengland2016
40,Park your Bike and Walk,"The walkways are very narrow on the canals so I recommend parking your bike on one of the side streets before venturing in. It is a great place to walk and look at very nice properties on a nice day. Very close to the beach, so if your looking to break away from the beach for nice walk, this is the place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamnRodgers
50,Gorgeous hidden gem,Beautiful area in the Venice neighborhood. If you want to get away from the hustle & bustle - I'd definitely suggest this for a short walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessjoyt

50,Beautiful Walk!,"I was in Los Angeles for a business meeting and was staying near Venice Beach. I went out to eat and while I was walking back to my hotel, I came across this amazing neighborhood. It is so beautiful! Sidewalks, bridges, water and doggies...what more could you ask for. Definitely take the time to walk the Venice Canals if you ever get a chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicaBryant

40,Really pretty walkway; a must if you visit LA,"Very lovely walk by the Venice canals. You are close to the water and can look at the pêle-mêle architecture that is typical of Venice Beach: old (ish) bohemian cottages, ugly Tuscan-style McMansions, and interesting and not-so-interesting postmodern rectangular blocs. Something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lunamax4
40,Delightful,"I learned only last year of the canals in Venice Beach and was curious to see for myself. Finding ourselves nearby, my family and i made a point of strolling among them. They are a tranquil and leisurely stroll mere blocks from the beach. We enjoyed the botanical beauty as well as the cool architecture of the whims. A great - and free - way to spend 20 minutes or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderD
50,Nice to compare to the real Venice,"Very tranquil area, try to visit during the week when it's not that busy. We drove around and stopped very easily to take pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJC1919
50,Relatively unknown jewel next to Venice Beach,"Venice owes its name to an attempt to create within Los Angeles limits a small replica of the canals of Venice, Italy. However, maintenance costs and other reasons led to a mostly undesirable area of dirty water. A major refurbish transform it in a grid of small canals and very well kept walkaways that have attracted upscale construction and has become one of the most desirable places to live in Los Angeles --for those who can afford it. A must see for anyone visiting the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/js0rel
50,Lovely for sunny stroll.,We had a brief 20-30 minute walk around the Canals and even had a nice chat with one of the locals who moved there from Ireland 20+ years ago. It's a cute and scenic little area of Venice and worth a walk to admire the canals/bridges and cute houses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nymou5
50,A beatiful surprise,"I have to admit that i have always thought that the Canal in Venice would have been a sad replica of the canals in Venice. Not at all. They are a peaceful oasis in L.A. and they have a great identity and personality. It's a nice stroll few blocks from the beach. The houses are gorgeous, really fantastic. Definitely a must go when you are in Venice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
40,Nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there!,"A brain-numbing contrast to a lot of the local LA area. Beautiful walkways, gardens and houses in a waterfront setting. You feel as though you are somewhere exotic.But.....If I lived there, I would stand at the front of my house all day fending off tourists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334
40,Beautiful place to relax,It is a great place to walk around. The walkway is a great place to take pictures. This place is not too far from LAX. I recommend people should take their out-of-town friends there for a walk if they come to visit via LAX.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlam18
50,A Must when in Venice,"We live just down the road so this is one of the walks we do when we have people visiting. When Abbott Kinney first designed Venice as a getaway for people in Los Angeles, he had Venice, Italy in mind. The canals are pristine and peaceful. Alot has changed in architecture styles, but there is still a mix of quaint beach bungalows with the new, modern architure thrown in. For people who love to admire echlectic houses and get garden ideas, it is a good place to check out during sunset. We love to stroll before Christmas too, when homeowners decorate their homes. There is even a small vessel parade!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baffo1
50,DAMN!,"I would like to see where on the face of the Earth someone could replicate what the good people of Southern California have put together here. Yes there are places not too far from here that showcase the excesses of LA, yet give the locals their due for this one. The owners of the impeccable Gardens that face the walking paths have outdone themselves. The care and attention to the horticulture is unsurpassed, each backyard its own work of art! One has to wonder when they can get out and enjoy what they have created, what with all the gawking tourists of of which we were 5.No kidding this place is not like the ""real"" Venice, give me a break! Where else in the world can you walk from garden to Garden unmolested, where the locals have broken out such loving creativity, almost for the pleasure and enjoyment of passers-by. Can anyone say where on Earth people spend millions of dollars to have a little piece of land in which to share their love of beauty with strangers ? Clearly ""keeping up with the Joneses"" plays into what we behold, yet there is something positively celebratory about what is offered up for our enjoyment. I for one am very grateful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MomoBobo
30,Awesome when there was no drought,"I had the chance of visit this place multiple times, and I can say that when there is no drought and there is plenty of water on the canals, the view is great, Great place to walk with your special other, date, etc. before the sunset the view and the feeling is kind of Romantic, the place is quiet and if you are lucky you will see some ducks splashing on the water.But if or when California is on a drought, I suggest to skip this place, because the lack of water just makes it sad. view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriquecoge9
40,Away from the Hustle and Flow,"This walkway is tucked away near Venice Beach. I spent 3 whirlwind days in LA for a combination of business and leisure, and found the crowds and bustle of LA a little overwhelming. A stroll through this quiet neighborhood was the antidote. My mother, sister and I all enjoyed this walk, recommended by a local friend, which was very quaint and picturesque.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icefoggy
50,Venice,"Walked along the beach. I am always going to love to visit places like Venice. I must highly recommend eating at Centanni if you are around and need some good Italian food and cannolis. They had the best, and I was with three Italians!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2004elisabeth
50,The best of Venice,"Visit the canals is the best you can do in Venice, It´s a really nice walk with beautiful houses there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaTarrifa
50,Welcome to Dreamland,"When walking in the canals, you enter into a tranquil lovely secret space. You have stepped into a time warp - to a sleepier, small town feeling and a relaxed pace. Strolling along the water, you may pause to notice ducks swimming in the canal, or a cat lying in the sun on a porch. The little bridges that connect different walkways are perfect photo opportunities. If you go toward the end of October, there will be Halloween decorations galore, including some animatronics. At Christmas, beautiful lights reflect on the surface of the water. Magical.I love joining this small community by supporting the quiet and the calm that are so important to the experience, and have always had the experience of others being highly respectful and appreciative as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcookson

30,If there is nothing else to do,A short walk along the canals.Might remind you Venice but it is far away from the real thing.It is close to Venice beach so I guess it worth spending a few minutes if you are there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shifo13
30,"Pretty to see, but just walk around and look at the houses","It is just a pretty walk and although I enjoyed it, I don't know that I would put them high on my list as there is so so much to do in LA. You basically walk all around the area and see the canals and houses. I did enjoy the walk and really enjoyed walking the shopping district and most of all, Venice Beach and the Muscle Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southmiamibeachbum
50,Perfect Walk,Being a Westside Local comes with its benefits. This includes taking a walk in the Venice Canals on a bad day. If I want to dream a little dream and just escape from the hustle I take a stroll through the canals and all is well.I love when things are nestled away for a great escape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chozanacs
30,"Nice, but now wow","Nice area with nice (expensive) houses. It has somewhat of a special atmosphere to it, but nothing like real ""venice"". If you are in the neighbourhood, ok, take 30 mins to see it, but otherwise dont bother to make a big detour for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garfield963
40,"If You Are At The Beach Anyway, Go, Otherwise, Don't bother","The Venice Canals is a neighborhood with pricey houses lining a concrete filled in canal. Designed by Abbott Kinney in the early 1900's as a vacation spot it had the man made canals and a huge pier on the beach. Those days are long gone.It is now a lovely spot to walk if you want to walk. There are ducks and now in a blue moon you may see someone in a little boat. But the water is not for bathing or swimming, the houses are no longer little and charming and the area is just a really expensive place to live.If you are at the Venice Beach (at the end of Washington Blvd, not Windward) then go for it. It is several blocks of canals with homes.Enjoy. Your wallet is in your front pocket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Quaint escape,A really quiet and quaint place to take a stroll. Tucked away not far from the beaches.Not ideal for large groups -walkways can be narrow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve
40,Nice to see but nothing amazing,I had wanted to see this place for a long time. So one morning i cycled from my hotel to here. It is nice to see the area and the houses are cool but because it is Venice it is hard to relax in the area. I love Venice but as a tourist it can be hard to know where is safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centrepunch

40,Away from the tawdry madness,"Venice beach is amazing for people watching and alternative views on life... But it can be crazy busy and not at all restful.Head inland a little to find the canals - walk up the road from Venice pier and you'll get to the start of the canals.Gardens in summer are very pretty, you can 'chat' with the occasional dog or cat and the ducks are quite amusing. Surprising to see so many little fish in the water.Worth a wander if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linbinpin

50,If you can't make the trip to Venice,Italy nope! But on a warm afternoon with a nice beach breeze and a little imagination one can see the gondola's passing by these narrow but well groomed canals.Very picturesque for those out of town travelers on a budget.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
30,Fine view and nice walk,The canal makes up for a fine walk and it is pretty and quiet. But not worth traveling through all of LA for,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leajorgensen
50,"Great food, beyond friendly service",We came for lunch before a visit to La Brea Tar Pits. My son melted down as we discovered he was running fever. Our waitress zoomed over with a drink and then a free chocolate shake. Husband dashed to nearby pharmacy for meds and we were all able to enjoy our delicious lunch. Best matzo ball soup ever. Very tasty pastrami and corned beef.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KingsvilleMom
40,Lovely,"The area is nice and quiet (it's a residential area) so its ideal if you want to take a casual stroll. The area is pretty shady too, which was lovely. They are hidden from the beach a bit, but keep walking through the streets and you will find them. I don't think they are a must visit when in LA, but if you've visited a few times and are in the area, its not a bad way to kill some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8137UUemmaw
40,Nice walk,Not really a must but if you are done with the boardwalk but it's still a bit too early for lunch/dinner go for a walk around the canals and see all the nice houses in the area. The lake was a bit dry when we were there so not a lot of boating going on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atraveler111
50,Lovely place to stroll,"The canals are hidden behind normal houses but once you find them you feel like you've been transported to little Italy , grab a drink put on comfortable shoes , grab your camera and walk the paths admiring all the beautiful houses as you criss cross the little wooden bridges you forget your in America . Lots of lovely photo opportunities a definitely not to be missed excursion !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
40,Pretty & peaceful,"Pretty and unique homes in a peaceful setting. Nice place to take a stroll. Take Dell avenue starting from 28th ave heading northwest over the bridges and get a general idea of the area, find free parking on any of the streets then walk around.Not worth making a trip from a far but if you are going to be in the area, I would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunmaid
30,Short walks,one walks pass an assortment of different designed homes in the higher $$$$ range garden are pretty and most well kept .People and dog friendly environment. Shame that the actual water level in some parts of the canal are drying up,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfourmeaux
50,Well hidden secret. Must see!,Got the tip from a colleague who lives here. Great place to walk around and admire the beautiful houses! Not crowded at all despite a very busy day at venice so dont think it is well known to tourists but definitely worth the short walk from venice beach. My teenage son of 18 loved it too! Takes 30 min and a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115marieangec
50,Interesting historical site.,It is amazing to learn the history of an area and see how the landscape has been changed over the years. Saw this locale with A Day in LA Tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeengreene
50,If You Can't Get to Venice Italy and are in LA......,"The Venice Canals are a wonderful addition to your tip to Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney attractions. Wander up and down at a leisurely pace either during the day or at night. You'll see all types of architecture, from the ""cottage"" or ""bohemian abode"" to ultra contemporary concrete and steel homes. All homes of course have docks and a variety of boats. Parking is sometimes challenging, but read the signs and a couple of turns around will usually yield a space. I have visited this site many, many times over the years and always am glad when I have made time to do so. If you like architecture, and have fantasized about living on the water, this is a must experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel

50,Lovely and Romantic,"Charming little houses with postage stamp yards, many beautifully landscaped, line the canals. Periodically the canals are bridged by arched, white, wooden walkways.. Skiffs and small rowboats tied up along the canals. I felt like I was walking in some epic romantic movie. I loved it. Unfortunately, I was not accompanied by a handsome lover - I had to make do with my best friend.

40,Very nice walk,Walking along the canals in Venice is very peaceful. The houses are close by and you can see people in their boats on the water. There are bridges that cross over the water. Venice Italy has much more history and nicer architecture. But Venice California has better weather!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
40,When We Have Out of Town Visitors,"When we have out of town visitors we usually take them to Venice Beach to see the oddities and the sights that they have heard about back home. When we get to the end of the attractions on Ocean Front Walk, we cross Pacific Avenue and begin walking the Canals. Everything changes, the pace slows, they begin talking about how nice it would be to live here.If you are near and haven't been I suggest you take a little time and visit. Remember not to wear your best shoes, the many ducks often leave behind reminders that this is their home as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenmO7019MI
40,Beautiful walk,It was kind of hard to find parking in the area. Canals were beautiful and peaceful. I loved walking around and look at all the houses nearby. It was worth a stop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliak663

50,"Venice, CA, USA and not Venice, Italy.","If you are in Southern CA, don't miss Venice Canals Walkway.

50,Lovely peaceful neighbourhood,"Great little neighbourhood, if included on a tour you will get info about the various celebrities that hve homes here but even without that it is nice jut to see a part of Los Angeles that time has forgotten. Highlight was the duck park (hope the ducks can read and know that park is for them)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJG1972
50,Beautiful evening stroll,"The Venice Canals neighborhood is very peaceful and lovely. The residents take good care of their properties and it's a great location to take photos of some of the unique homes, landscapes, even pets and ducks who take up residence along the walk.

50,Beautiful stroll,"If you have an hour to spare in Venice, take your time to walk through the canals. - grab a drink to take along and just enjoy the scenery. Wonderful diversity of homes and relaxing event. Much of it is shaded. The architecture and landscaping of these smaller but plush homes is quite a lesson!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64pennyj
40,Enhance your beach visit with history,The Venice Canals should not be missed if you visit the Venice Beach. It takes no more than 45 minutes to 60 minutes to walk the canals completely. You can gain an appreciation for the houses that line the canals along with the history. I strongly suggest using your smart phone to help investigate the history of the canals before or at least during your visit. Understanding how they got there and why they are still there is very insightful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyl157
50,Totally Different,Take a walk around the canals for something really different. The houses are amazing and the gardens are fantastic. The water does stink. It's just a short walk up from Venice Beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412teganm
40,Nothing like Italy,A drive along Dell Avenue (one way northbound) through the center of this canal community is enough. Stop on the bridges and take your photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641steveb
50,Very nice place place to walk,Very nice place to walk and watch the interesting houses by the canals. Is is a very quiet neighbourhood. It does't even seem you are in a crowded beach area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelloNitz
50,Beautiful to see,Very beautiful peaceful area to walk around with lots of bridges around to cross. Lots of unusual unique beautiful houses too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lightwing12Star
50,Fantastic family walks in the early morning as well as late afternoon,"Stayed at a lovely Airbnb right on Venice Canal and explored the neighborhood early in the morning (7 am on a Monday). The layout is like a hand - you can easily spend an hour or two walking along the sidewalks lining the canal without coming near any cars, which gives it an idyllic atmosphere. It's also easier to walk around with little kids like that! Pretty much every bridge is a Pokestop here by the way, which is a perk. Aside from catching pokemons, we saw lots of ducks & gulls in the still water and cats lounging around the picturesque little houses.I also snapped beautiful late afternoon shots here - the golden light works so well on the water with all those white bridges!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luciennemay
30,Not worth a dedicated visit,"Basically dried out canals which seem like swamps. Seems more like a flooded back alley for expensive houses who got fooled into buying ""canal facing houses"" although they are a block away from Venice beach (selling ice to the Eskimo). Don't waste your time coming here unless you are tired from Venice beach and have nothing to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yashgupta25
40,Charming neighborhood walk,"We were staying at a hotel nearby & decided to walk the canals as the sun was setting. The light was beautiful BUT it was low tide.

Some lovely homes, some funky homes, and the neighborhood is very charming so I think it's worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresaw
50,Wonderful Experience,"Venice canals walkway is a excellent experience. The restaurants, places for photographers and watching people. We had a great time in Venice and will do this again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597rahulb
30,It's fairly pretty but...,"when you look closely you can see that the water is quite nasty and dirty and shallow. It looks best at night when you can't see what it really looks like. The canals are more like a swamp but don't tell the people with houses along the canals that. They'd be none to happy as they are quite proud to live on a stagnant canal of green water which harbors humidity, mosquitos and algae. I don't see how fish could survive in it but who knows....I've never seen any.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topjoe
50,Beautiful!,It is a really nice evening stroll before or after dinner. We walked through the canals several times and it never got old. Some of the houses are very beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Launan49

40,Something To Do After Visit To Venice Beach,"After walking along Venice Beach to see ocean and all the different characters, which we enjoyed, walk a few blocks to Venice Canals. Worth the trip. Amazing how some of the small houses on the canals, go for one $ 2 million, with very tiny lots. But I guess being a few blocks from Ocean is reason.We were visiting family in LA area and this was one of our side trips. Glad we went.Being from Florida, parking is a challenge to us in L in general and Venice Beach in particular. Turned down places that cost $30, and found one that was $20. Used it was about 2 hours... Later saw large Municipal lot that cost $18, so did not feel too bad paying $20. You don't have much choice. Extremely crowded this time of year.If you have opportunity to visit outside of summer, you might find less stressful. We were glad we went.Be prepared for crowds, traffic, etc etc, but that is part of experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntA3337AN
50,peaceful and quaint,I have always been wanting to find the Venice canals! it is just as charming in person as it is portrayed in the movies. each house has character and no 2 are alike. its a good after dinner walk and exploration. it would be awesome if they had actual boat rides through the canals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575lynnl
50,Hidden Gem in Los Angeles,"Please check out the Venice Canals during the day. It was built with the original canals in Venice, Italy. There are a series of bridges over the water as you travel from street to street. This is a residential area, so best to be courteous to the residents by remaining on the bridge. The lighting at night is not as conducive to enjoy the view and you could be arrested for trespassing. Be respectful but enjoy the view. FYI: there are many restaurants within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaR824

It's definitely worth a trekk through the neighborhood as it will not consume very much time to pass through. This is what gives this Cali city it's name.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/papag611
40,Insanely beautiful,"Before I went there I thought a place likes this can´t exist for real. Each house is much different, clean modern bauhaus architecture mixes with old wooden houses. Go there and enjoy a sunset. It´s amazing. The only downside is weird smell from time to time, maybe coming from standing waters or dog leftovers;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnBartos
40,Peaceful. Oasis in the capital of camp.,"LA can have some of the campiest places you'll ever want to see.

50,So not LA,"This is a place you don´t expect to find in LA, absolutely beautiful surroundings, nice walkways and laid back tempo. Worth the stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unicornone
50,Simply Beautiful,We rented bikes from the Venice Beach Rentals and rode over to the canals. You have to walk the bike on this path but it so tranquil and pretty. The homes are gorgeous and there was one homeowner playing music and chilling on his patio. He was very nice and didn't make us feel that we were invading his space - You are literally walking right behind their homes. Although I was with my Mom & sisters - I could see this being a very romantic place if you were with your significant other.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoniqueW281

The Uber driver was confused as to why we had any interest in going to Venice, especially to a random side street. The canals were beautiful and it was fun to see the different homes and yards. After walking the canals we headed to the beach front and quickly realized why our Uber driver was questioning our decision. The rest of Venice was a bust. We quickly called another Uber and headed to Santa Monica for dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm817
50,Beautiful homes,"Although we got moved on whilst taking pictures recently, this small-but-select area of lovely homes is worth taking a while to see. An eclectic mix of modern and classic, one next to the other, it would be a dream to own one...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margondine
50,Hidden gem,Just a few minutes from Venice beach is the venice canals development. A beautiful community of houses and canals. It's great to walk around ans see some nice houses and feel the atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shivs
30,Nothing Special Regarding Venice Canals Walkway,Was excited to finally see the Venice Canals Walkway but it wasn't as pretty as I was expecting. I've seen them on many TV shows and movies but the water level was low and the water isn't very clean looking so the appearance isn't what I was expecting. There are empty boats along the canal and quite a few walking bridges but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this attraction. If you are visiting Venice Beach and have extra time you can walk over to see them. They are about 2 blocks off of the Boardwalk but more toward the sound end of the Boardwalk and I would ask a local to ensure you get there. There are only houses and condos next to the walkway except near a main entrance and you might come along a restaurant but I didn't see any gift stores or much else to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,Self Paced walk - Venice Canals,We came across this quite by accident after jumping out of an Uber taxi. We spent the next few hours strolling at a leisurely pace the canals - what a great little gem this was. Recommend it for anyone - on a hot day make sure u have plenty of sun screen and water !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/866soniaw
30,Nothing special,Quet residential place. 5-10 mins walkthrough will be enough. Be careful on the bridges since they dont have allocated pedestrian track.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderKorablev
30,Evening stroll,"After the zaniness of the beachfront walk, we found the canals tranquil and simply strolled over the several bridges viewing from each. Residential area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewForestView
40,Charming,"We were visiting Venice and decided to check out the canals which we only recently discovered were there. When we think of Venice we only knew of the 'freak show' and muscle beach. The canals were incredible peaceful and the homes along it were charming. It doesn't take very long to walk along it, but it was fun to see. Lots of people were having outdoor dinner parties; it looks like a fun community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjkel
50,Reminiscent of Italy,"If you have been to Venice, you must visit this Western version of the great Italian city. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
40,Nice neighborhood to peer into,"Not a gated community which is almost unusual. The canal neighbourhood is in a small area so you can walk all the canal walkways in a short period of time. Nice to look at the plants the inhabitants have put in and also into their houses. Glass houses make for zoos.If you were wondering, locks keep the water level (should be tidal) high during low tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YVRcockroach
30,faintly reminiscent of the canals in the Netherlands,"By all means go walk by the canals after you've ""done"" the Venice Beach boardwalk. Though the ambience is less the canals and palazzos of Venice, Italy. More like Marken or Vollendam. Lush gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingC0mpani0ns
50,Gorgeous,We rented a place right on the canal. Excellent place for a little walk. The canals get partially drained on Tue and Thursday so they get a little low. Pick any other day if you can to go there. Some of those homes are so creative. Its a one of a kind place. Give yourself an hour to walk the entire canals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanneLee
50,Hard to find but worth it,Went on a tour which helped us find it and understand how they came to be. We really began to understand the neighborhood after seeing these canals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pateng112
30,Venice Canals,"I'm being a bit harsh by rating this a 3, and I did enjoy getting to see the canals in Venice. About a 5 minute walk from the Venice boardwalk (if you're near the Muscle Beach Gym), it is definitely worth seeing it just to say you have. The canals are in the middle of a neighborhood and it's a good jogging path for locals.The reason I rated it a 3 was as interesting as it was to see, once you saw it, you pretty much saw the whole thing. I wouldn't waste much more than a half hour here. There's so much more to see on the boardwalk, especially if you're restricted for time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAGuy4465
50,"If you like gardening, don't miss these!","Such a relaxing walk, and a lovely way to see lots of backyards up close. Everyone has a beautifully landscaped garden in their backyard and each one is unique. Go enjoy a walk along the water with beautiful gardens!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberr14
40,Not to be missed,Not quite like Venice in Italy but still fun - most people just go to the beach and boardwalk but miss out on such a gem. Very close to the beach and not too hard to walk - a very pretty part of the area and so different to the rest of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
50,Great place to walk and discover,"Walking distance from Venice Beach, lovely place to stroll and take pictures. Went with my daughter in a rush but next time I will make it a point to do it more leisurely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lili_Steiner
40,Worth the visit,"We came on a sunny day and were very impressed to found the houses, plant and canals are so well-maintained there. The environment is so peaceful, totally worth the time to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamhamham
50,A little Surprise,A friend had told us to visit the Canals while we were at Venice Beach so we asked a local to point us there. It was a short walk from Venice Beach although we realised afterwards that we had only seem a small part of the Canals. We were pleasantly surprised at how pretty it was and the contrast to the beach area. I would recommend visiting the Venice Canals if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliSydney_Australia
50,Hidden Gem in Venice,"The canals are a peaceful respite in the heart of Venice. A short walk from the Venice Beach Boardwalk, the canals are worth seeing. Make sure to bring a camera because the light is great and the houses and gardens are beautiful. You can walk up and down the canals from South Venice to Washington Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenRiley44
50,"Gorgeous, tranquill area","Perfect place for a walk and contemplation. A hidden oasis in a busy big city with beautiful houses, bridges and walkways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaWannman
40,A delightful place,"We went here yesterdayWhat a delightful place! We took a stroll around the homes are wonderful all are unique with beautiful plants. We even saw a boat that is a black swan. There was a cute fence with flamencos, a tree with hanging lanterns. We even saw a mermaid. It is a wonderful place to take a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travlerlee
40,A Hidden Gem...,"Who knew that Venice, LA was modelled on Venice, Italy! These canals are an unexpected delight. Stroll along the walkways, and take in the charming homes and gardens. A truly unique find in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamahoz
50,Beautiful + relaxing,"We enjoyed walking and taking in the views of the homes, canals, flowers. We did get some nice photos, but I'm not including right now (don't want to take the time). We both thought it was worth taking the time to find a parking place + walk along the paths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62aliciac
40,Nice weather helped a lot.,Make sure you're going on a good day. The colors and the simplicity of the place makes you want to have a coffee and enjoy the relaxed vibe. (It was Sunday so it was quite quiet.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a2afelipe
50,Looking for a lovely quiet stroll...,"The canals were built by Mr. Abbott Kinney in 1905. Mr. Kinney was very influential in the development of the entire Venice area.The canals encompass 12 acres of narrow sidewalks, wooden foot bridges and bridges for cars too.So much to look at, I felt like I was watching a tennis match! People in their little boats paddling along. Art sales in the front yard. So many styles of homes and landscaping!No need to go to the gym today, especially if you cover the entire 12 acres crossing over each bridge.We met lots of interesting people of all ages out enjoying a quiet stroll too. We took pictures, with their camera, of folks posing on the bridges or in front of a special boat, in turn, they took our picture. Great way to begin a conversation.Wheel chairs and strollers are permitted, no other wheeled transportation allowed so the sidewalks are safe for folks of all ages, and well behaved pets on a leash. Just make sure to have pick up bags.Depending where you enter/exit the canals you can find restaurants and shops.There is no public parking in the canals nor public restrooms.Please be respectful to the residents, if they do not offer a greeting they may wish to be left alone.I am very much looking forward to going back. I am sure the canals are awesome during the holidays. Watch the parade of boats then take a stroll through.Such a wonderful way to spend an hour or two.We rode the 33 Metro bus from Western exiting at Rivera. The Big Blue bus and 733 also cruise the area. Washington is also a major bus line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bertaannf
40,"Cool, But not really historic","I grew up in this area as a kid, and it is nothing like it was back then. It is so much nicer! Cleaned up, polished nicely and only rich folk can afford to live there and the shacks and dilapidated buildings are all gone. It doesn't even stink anymore and I didn't see any oil floating in the canals at all, and no pond scum, either. And there is so much more water; the ducks can actually swim!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321timothys
40,Beautiful for a quiet stroll,"Not much going on here except exceedingly expensive homes and peaceful pathways along the canals. It's a gallery of architectural styles, and observing the lives of people in several terrarium style homes. Parking is very tricky on incredibly narrow roads and remember many roads around the canals are one way. There are often duck families and other animals (including people) running around that you may not see until you reach the peak of a bridge so drive slow - or better yet, just walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CignoNero
50,"If you are at Venice Beach, walk a couple blocks and take a look!","It is pretty neat that the city was named after these canals. They are only a couple blocks from Venice Beach and offer a sidewalk along the canal to walk down to view. I was surprised that the water is only a foot or so deep - explains why there were no boats - just kayaks. There are even bridges like in Venice, Italy, you can walk over to access the other side of the canal. It is free and easy to get to and neat to see... so, why not?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctaylor0159
50,Romantic,The views are beautiful. Great facades to see. Ideal escapade to walk and talk with your loved one. Really great place if you like taking photographs. Tip: get a coffee to enjoy while you get lost on those tiny streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucass540
50,Hidden gem!,This was a treat we stumbled upon while walking back to our car from the beach. Beautiful canals with walkways and bridges. The architecture...oh wow!! All different styles of houses here. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanital2014
50,Venice Off the Beaten Track,"Most people who come to Venice come for the beach. The beach and the strand are great places to people watch, from Muscle Beach to the entertainers. Most people, however, miss the canals and in so doing, miss understanding why Venice is called Venice. Located between Washington and Venice Boulevards, just a few blocks east of the beach, it is possible to walk the sidewalks lining the canals. There are a wide variety of homes, from the simple cottages originally built here, to the ultra modern homes that have been replacing them. Some of the homes are wonderful, others... You can also drive through the area. Go north on Dell, off of Washington. You will cross over 4 bridges getting good views down each of these canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
40,Cute,Nice to wander through the canals on a sunny morning. But nothing much else to do. Really close to Venice Beach and Washington Blvd restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariliafredini

50,Day or night...,"I've been here so many times: Day and night, Alone and with a date, Party-holiday or no reason at all.Walking the canals is so good. Check out the eclectic architecture...italian-spanish-confusions, gaudy McMansions, slick moderns to funky original beach bungalows.It's a great place to view architecture. Take a date and find out what they like during the day. Take a date and find if they have a voyeur side.Plenty of nearby parking at the lot. Even better if you quickly read the history behind the manmade are canals.Yes yes yes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Highlight of a day trip,"Daytrip to Santa Monica and Venice Beach, but walking over the the canals was the highpoint. I walked up and down each path, enjoying the ambiance. The houses are varied- some quaint bungalows, some modern, but all are really in keeping with the atmosphere of the canals. I really enjoyed the set back ones with patios. Next trip I do an airbnb and sit on one of those patios myself- and watch the tourists stroll past!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer

40,A little slice of Italy..,Quaint and lovely place snuggled in crazy Venice Beach. Easy walking and lots to see in a short span of a few blocks...the canals are so unusual for California...Looks like Venice Italy shared a part of its charm...only thing missing was the gondolas !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommacita5
50,One of a kind; not to be missed,"A perfect set up for a morning walk in between coffee stops or after breakfast. Don't limit yourself to the (infamous) boardwalk while in Venice. Together with the ""walk"" streets, this is the way to see the real Venice (and why it is called this way!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508henric
50,Beautiful!,"Great place for a stroll. Very unique little out of the way neighborhood. Beautiful homes situated on the canals with multiple walkways, and bridges. Very peaceful and tranquil",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaG1969
40,Prettiest Part of Venice,"Venice is not my favorite beach in the Los Angeles area. However, the canal walkways are worth seeing if you are ever in the area. You walk on a narrow sidewalk past peoples front doors. The houses are all unique and most are colorful. It only takes 30 minutes to accomplish as it only runs a couple of blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/475karag
50,So peaceful,A very beautiful area not to miss. Very peaceful atmosphere with nice houses. May be dangerous for children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabhk
40,Great gentle exercise,"I'm staying close with my son and just love walking along the canals, it is hard to believe you are in LA, ducks/squirrels and water birds greet you everyday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarleneRay
50,Beautiful and peaceful area to stroll around in,"I was quite taken aback by how lovely these canals were; the colourful houses with their beautiful flowers will make you envious of those that live there. It's a beautiful area to get lost in and just enjoy walking around, away from the hustle-and-bustle of Venice Beach itself. Very tranquil.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiobhanFL
40,Scenic walk,"If you're in the area and you want to adventure past the beach, this is a nice scenic route. You walk past the houses on the canal, each of them unique. Of to little turns and bridge ways. The day we were there is was very quite but still a few people walking around. Not far from the beach so worth a little adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
50,A short stop before the beach!,The Venice Canals are 15 mins from the Venice Beach. There are 4 canals and they are all worth of pictures. The whole walk plus picture time should take about 30 minutes.Tip: Go during the week between 10-3pm. Park in Dell street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariangiec
50,"Tranquil, well-heeled oasis","Surprisingly tranquil & beautiful oasis right near over-the-top Venice Beach. A lovely way to walk from our hotel in the marina to the beach, admiring the beautiful homes and lush gardens, before hitting the frenetic Ocean Front Walk. To get there, head down Washington Blvd towards the beach and take a right just before crossing the Grand Canal. It's not Venice, Italy, but the water is cleaner and the weather is much, much better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plyons_au
50,Pleasant and different !,Interesting canalside architecture of many wellkept private homes.pleasant and relaxing stroll contrasts with much of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsM3853UC
50,Highlight of my short trip!,"This little slice of heaven came outta nowhere! I was biking and exploring the busy Venice Beach area. But decided to take a small detour not expecting much... But immediately the colorful loud atmosphere died away completely and I spent nearly an hour wandering around this area... Dragon flies, ducks, flowers of every color, and the most beautiful houses you can imagine. I went on a Monday, and only saw a handful of other people, not sure if I'd enjoy it as much if it was busier, the paths are very narrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748richiet
40,"Great, it deserves a visit","I went to see the Venice Canals because last time i was in L.A. i didn't have time to see them. I was quite skeptic about them. I must admit that they are very nice. I was expecting a bad copy of the italian canals in Venezia but not at all. They are very nice, with beatiful houses and with their own identity and personality. We spent almost 1 hours strolling on the canal side looking at the houses and the gardens. It's a great alternative to the mess of Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
40,Great walk and photo ops,"The stroll through the canals were awesome. Very impressive homes, great flora, there are ducks all over. The only down side is that because of the drought the canals are down and there is literally not enough water to ride canoes or kayak which would make the view so much exiting. We spent about 45 minutes walking. You have to park your car and then walk along the canals. Parking is not easy to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiet0813
50,Worth the short walk from the beach,"If you go to Venice, don't spend all of your time at the beach or on the boardwalk--venture a block inland and take 20 minutes out of your day to stroll up and down the canals which frame a unique neighborhood. The canals abound with photo ops between the peaceful canals to the impressive and expensive houses which line the waterways. Our walk through the canals was the highlight of our afternoon in Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
40,Such a Romantic location in a busy city!!!!,Me and my wife went to Venice canals and walked for almost 2 hours and I really loved it and loved how the walkways are decorated. I recommend those walkways for every couple. Just walk carefully because cycling is allowed and you don't want someone to pump into you with a bicycle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316fahmim
50,This place is amazing!,Well worth the visit on your next adventure out in LA - Venice as the name suggests - is just like Venice in Europe - and in the pas - before the introduction of cars - there were even more canals! We spent a couple of hours just walking around taking photos in this beautiful piece of LA! Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben-waters

40,Great for a leisurely walk,"Step away from the busy beach walk and a few blocks away you have the narrow, calm walkways in this residential area. We saw beautiful (and some not so beautiful) houses, people waking, and hummingbirds. Not a place to jog or speed walk: the pathways are too narrow. But ideal for an after dinner stroll",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UE_DC64
40,Fun walk,"We had a fun time strolling along the paths bordering the Venice canals admiring the lovely houses and grounds and watching the ducks and other water birds. The experience made me want to move to the area so I could enjoy this charming walk on a regular basis. Parking is a bit of a problem, but we finally found a space on a nearby street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/199ruthg
40,Nice and especially nice when Christmas lights are out,Walked along the canals a couple times with family. Very quaint and picturesque. Houses are mostly lovely and walking along the canals makes you feel like you're someplace else. We went around Christmas time and the lights just added to the charm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelagentreplies
50,Beautiful stroll which should not be missed.,"Since we stayed close to the Venice Canals we incorporated them into our daily morning walk. It is such a pleasant walk along the canals viewing the beautiful homes. One can do a quick walk from Washington to the end and then walk to the Venice Boardwalk which takes you to the Pier or to Santa Monica which can be quite the hike. As you stroll along the Canals make sure to cross the bridges from side to side to get a good view from both sides. This is such a pleasant way to spend some leisurely time. Do not rush. Take in the beauty of nature, the canals, the gardens and the lovely homes that the owners take such pride in their upkeep. This is a beautiful treAsure in the Marina del Rey and Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retiree55
30,Not so good with a bike,"I visited the canals during a bike around Venice Beach. Unfortunately you can't take the bikes along the edge and there aren't a lot of places to lock them up. The bridges over the canals are also very steep to try and cycle over so you have to push them. And avoid the tourist buses that take up most of the road.The area itself is lovely and peaceful, especially after the Boardwalk. Worth a walk, but leave the bike back in Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuzKa

40,Hidden Gem,We didn't even know these beautiful views existed until a local told us to wander back there. It was so nice to see these canals and the houses on them were so unique and interesting to look at. Each house was different and so cool to see.

40,Nice place to walk and watch,Quiet area. Not a lot of people in comparison to the other areas of Venice Beach. We enjoyed walking through the neighborhoods. One thing to note is that the walkways are narrow in places. Some areas had landscaping that had grown out over the side of the walkway. We had to walk single file in a couple of areas. Lots of flowers to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenwalleye
50,Hidden Whimsy,"This place is definitely hidden within the neighborhood, but it's a gorgeous place once you find it.Some of the homes, lining the waterways, are beautiful.

50,Calm walk away from busy Los Angeles,"We originally found the canals almost by chance and loved walking round the canals, across the bridges and looking at all the different styles and sizes of houses.

40,Beautiful Place to stroll- not to bike,"It's a beautiful place to stroll around and look at the beautiful canals. However my friend and I tried to take the bikes we rented on the beach onto the canals walkways and it is very had due to the thin pathways and the fact that the Borges are very steep. All in all, it is a beautiful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
50,Great morning walk,"We walked the canals on the first morning of our trip to L.A, and were really glad we did.

30,Remote but worth a visit (if you got time),Remote and very quiet walkway with the look of Venice. Nice place to take a leisurely stroll but nothing much to do in my opinion...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s2jinalee
50,Cool place to check out,"Some people - like me - are too poor to go to the real Venice across the Atlantic so we settle with imitations, but hey, this is pretty cool too! Modeled after its namesake with its own SoCal flair, this charming canal-filled neighborhood is definitely a pleasant, interesting experience to walk through.Park your car just outside the block and walk across the bridges to pass through canals. I guess this is slightly better than its Italian counterpart because it's much more organized (rectangular areas organized by straight canals) and clean (no smelly canal) but maybe I'm just saying all this because I am a hater and want to make myself feel better for settling with this SoCal imitation! Before we engage in a Venice, CA vs Venice, Italy war, I would like to conclude that this photogenic area is definitely worth checking out, whether you have been in Venice Italy or not!Please please please be considerate that this is a residential neighborhood so don't be a loud tourist like you would in the real Venice Italy - at least that's what I envisioned the real Venice to be.---By the way, the famous Venice Beach is just a short walk away from here, so why not add the beach on top of your canal stroll too? I definitely know the real Venice doesn't have a dope beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayyen93
40,Beautiful place not to be missed,Picturesque area. The walkway gives tourists opportunities to take pictures of the houses by the canal. The only drawback is the walkway maybe narrow if more people like us want to take a stroll alone the canal. There is not much to do there except taking pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelL667

50,A Unique Part Of The City,"Having briefly visited the Canals on a previous visit some years ago, we were keen to return and spend more time on the Bridges and Walkways. It was interesting to see how the arrival of bigger net worth residents has pushed some of the properties to a higher level of structure, although some of the earlier buildings still remain. However, the fascinating feel for the area still remains. Take a walk down Dell Avenue and over the four Bridges to enjoy stunning views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsandrs

50,Canal paths a delight,"We stayed in an airbnb in Venice and I walked the canals and other neighborhood walkways every day.

20,"Venice, not",The Venice canals are actually canals of sitting water collecting smelly pond scum in the LA heat. The houses are the highlight of the walk. Why anyone would want to live there is beyond me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJ_EBs007

40,What a lovely surpirse!,"So Venice boardwalk is good for people watching, but to get the grungy feeling off of your poor bodies, take them down to the canals where one could have much time to kill walking many cute bridges near adorable houses.

""Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice!"" - Jim Morrison",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaJ805
30,Not really anything like Venice,"We were pretty underwhelmed. Possibly we were tired, having just walked here from Santa Monica Pier, but we didn't really see what the hype was about. It wasn't at all as beautiful as Venice, in Italy, it was more like the canals in East London; but with better weather and more canal side detached properties. It was pleasant to walk through, but not that exciting. Enjoyed the walk down the beach more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateP968
50,A world away!,"I strolled through on a winter weekday afternoon. Completely serene and plenty of parking, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's a different story on the weekend.

40,Hard to Find Parking,"Highly recommend making a visit, though be aware that parking is not easy to find. Not a terribly large area but good for a leisurely walk to soak in the interesting details. Certainly not something one expects to find in the area. If you only know Venice for its boardwalk and beach, then this will be a pleasant surprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremiahg698

50,Must see,We went here right before exploring Venice Beach..really peaceful and serene I would say a must see as far as tourist attractions. Really cool houses that line the canals with funky bridges connecting them. A short walk to Venice Beach we just Ubered there then walked to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rtat23
40,Lovely way to waste a couple of hours,"Just a nice, peaceful way to waste a couple of hours walking the canals and daydreaming what it would be like to live in one of the houses. Then after you can saunter off for a casual drink at one of the local bars. Bliss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lennybaker
50,Great activity if you are on the Westside,"We love coming here and strolling around a bit. Nice to see the setup and the houses. I would budget 60 - 90 minutes. You may have to park and walk a bit to get there.If I were not on the West Side of LA, I don't think that the canals are worth a visit on their own",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831curtisd

50,Hidden Gem,We came across the canals and enjoyed wandering along the edges. It was a surprise find and really pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyh96
40,Small but interesting.,My sister and I were looking for something to do in the area and we fell upon this recommendation. Using google maps we found it quite easily. It is interesting walking around especially having been to Venice Italy. The only drawback of the walkways is that I felt like I was trespassing as we were walking behind people's homes. We were here on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy so we were able to take some pretty good shots. It is something to heck out but I would not go out of my way for this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miicha04
50,Classic Canals in Venice,"The best time to visit the canals are during the Christmas season as many of the homes are really masterfully lit up and you will see people strolling through the canals.

50,Wonderful oasis in the hectic world,"I was treated with a walk in Venice Canals Walkway by a friend who lives in LA. After 4 days of conference from dusk till dawn it was magical to walk here, in nice weather and just take all the beautiful, funny, different houses and gardens in. It was around Halloween, so a lot of scary stuff in the gardens gave us a good laugh.Please take your time, enjoy the lovely views. Be aware, that the signs outside some of the houses says ""Armed response"" which was more scary than the Halloween stuff for a Dane like me :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jette108
50,A cool and delightful promenade through Venice Canals,"You cannot come to LA and not visit Venice, especially Venice Canals. A few minutes away from the all singing and dancing entertainment of Venice beach, lies the tranquil setting of quaint little houses bordering water and bridges that make Venice Canals a must for all visitors. Weaving in and out of its pedestrian walkways, one can encounter people and animals that share the special location that is this little corner of a Venetian type waterway engineered by Abbott Kinney in the early 1900.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tilda162
10,Very disappointed,"We went to the venice canals expecting a nice, pretty walk before moving on to venice beach. What we found was canals with filthy, black water with a foul stench.

It happened to be close to sunset when be arrived which made it even more enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatwins
50,A must for home design junkies,"Venice canals walkway runs through a small residential area adjacent to Venice Beach.

50,Relaxing walk,"I've seen the canals in movies and tv and always drawn to it. It was low tide when I took my walk, and I would've liked higher tide for pictures. But I'm so glad I found it. It was quiet, peaceful, serene. It was definitely my favorite spot on my California visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sadie1110
40,Hidden surprise,A local informed us about this area. An easy walk in from Venice Beach. It is only a small area of canals but we found it interesting.

40,Pretty and unique,"We enjoyed having a stroll along the various canal walkways.

We paid $20 at a nearby lot but I think we saw cheaper afterwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtapestry

30,Meh. a decent walk.,"It's cool to walk around and see the houses.and see the canals. But it is not worth any kind of special visit. If you are close by, go for it. It's worth doing once. If not, you need not go out of your way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliE706

We parked on side streets and walked to canals...the scenery is breathtaking so beautiful and the homes there are really nice...across the canals is Venice beach. We really enjoyed Los Angeles and California coast much more than Florida...IT IS WOW Cannot wait to go again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baghdadlian
30,"Like the other Venice, there's good and not-so-good things about walking along the canals here","With a name like Venice, what's not to like about strolling along the canal? Well, authentically, the smell and the neighborhood come to mind. These canals were built for the same reason as those in Italy: to drain the land. That means stagnation; hence the smell. The pathways do give you view of cute/nice houses and their fenced-off gardens. And some not-so-much: just like the other Venice.Go a half block in any direction and you'll get one or more of: down-a-step neighborhood, busy thoroughfare, upscale and semi-gated-off marina living, expensive but small apartments.Go several blocks west and you come to arguably the funkiest beach front on the planet: Venice Beach: home to the homeless and slumming center for those with with uncountable homes. With aggressive medical marijuana vendors and tourists from throughout the world interacting with those on every conceivable conveyance. A place where beautiful people go to noticeably talk with, or avoid eye contact with, the folks from the other side of the opportunity/motivation gap.Back to the point, the paths of the Venice canals offer a quiet place to stroll and to stay out of the glare of midday sun and the glare of public view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1187RJdavidp

I feel as though I've been transported to Venice Italy while there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanyikasooalo
40,"Venice canals, CA","Lovely stroll along pathways, one a breast, past canal homes. We opted for metered parking after driving around for awhile, no way we were paying $15 to park for 45mins. Patience, a few quarters and we walked for an hour. Enjoyable. Recommended. Wheelchair, elderly friendly, no need to cross intersecting bridges, just meander around. Lots of greenery to look at most of it is in someone's abode. Nonetheless, hibiscus, bird of paradise, hydrangea, even found a wattle tree!",
20,Not worth it!,"Had the place been properly managed, there would have been lots of opportunity for photography. Very few canals with hardly had any water during our visit. The bridges were covered in plastic, probably for some kind of renovation. Not many people around except for a few tourists. Just a walk from the Venice beach parking lot which charges you $9 for the whole day. Later realised that a street parking would have been cheaper.",
50,Beautiful area.,We loved our stroll round this area. It was extremely pretty & a pleasant place to visit. There are some amazing houses in this lovely setting.,
50,BRING A CAMERA,"Just beautiful , full of flowers and landscaped areas . Lots of walking room , not a lot of people . Lots of Birds :)",
50,Fantasy Land,"It is fun to walk the Venice Canals imagining the great dream when they were constructed. Today, the fantasy is imagining living there in these million dollar homes. It is picturesque. The architecture and landscaping is phenomenal but I’m not sure if I would want hordes of tourists walking a few feet from my window. But if someone wants a house sitter, I’d give it a try!",
20,Don't bother,"This is a neighborhood and not worth getting to. A few canals which were ""low water"" when we were there. Probably nice enough to have a house on the canals, but not nice enough to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoBuoy

The original canals were built in the early 1900, fell into disrepair and filled in, then revitalized in the 1990's. It encompasses about a 9 block square area with concrete sidewalks and arched bridges across the canals.The residential neighborhood is made up of small bungalows each with it own character and many sporting lovely gardens, fountains and lounging areas overlooking the watery byways. The canals are peppered with colorful row boats tied up to the sides and giving even more of a romantic ambiance to the area.A beautiful and quiet respite if in the Venice Beach area.

50,A fun FREE sight,The Venice canals are a must-see if you are in the area. Free and easy to walk around (finding parking in the area might be your only issue.... park on the main street and walk over to the streets) and easy to spend time exploring. We went during golden hour around dusk and it was beautiful! We parked and walked through on our way to venice beach for sunset-- highly recommend. Makes for great pictures!

Enjoy ....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,A lovely afternoon walk,"Venice has had several incarnations in the past half century and this latest is one of the hippest. The canals have been cleaned and the nighborhood gentrified. A walk through the venice canals is like a stroll through Amsterdam, Brugges, or the real Venice in Italy. It is a charming area that is ringed with restaurants and bars, but insulated from other urban activity.

40,Venice Canals Part of a Lost Era,"Most people who live in Los Angeles, themselves are likely unaware of this wonderful part of town, part of a lost era in the history of the Los Angeles and Venice area.These canals were once more publicized, larger (more of them) and likely more used. However, they are now a small part of Venice and pretty much an unknown delight.Unfortunately, parking in this neighborhood is so difficult as to make it perhaps not worth a special trip to Venice just to see them. There are really no ""streets to walk"" since the canals, themselves, are where the ""normal"" streets would be. They are difficult ""walk"" and very single dimensional. This is a very neat thing to see if in the area and you happen to stumble upon them or find a place to park. The neighborhood is extremely congested and the antithesis of what these canals were all about.Fun to see if in the area. Perhaps not worth a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918
50,Why?,"Why do neighbourhoods always change for the better after I leave? When I was at UCLA in the early 1970s I had a girlfriend who leased a house here. This place was a dump surrounded by narrow, garbage infested swamps called canals. We were young and didn't care! It is completely different now, cleaned up and folksy-artsy-wealthy! And when you are done walking along the walks, if you are so inclined, you can always head away from the canals and toward the beach then turn right and head north a few blocks to view the weirdos left over from MY era!

40,Pleasant Vistas,"Took a slow drive around the canals and found it to be a rather relaxing experience just off the heart of Los Angeles (as the car drives). Peaceful, calming and almost other worldly in contrast even to Santa Monica's laidback cool. However it resembles the real Venice canals about as much as I resemble Kylie Minogue.Also, beware, the parking lots around Venice Beach make one wonder whether extortion is actually a crime in California, disgracefully expensive if one only wishes an hour or twos stay and ignoramuses of the highest order running them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marksw3960

50,Pleasant brief diversion!,"My teenage son and I had landed in LA and were headed up to Malibu. Thanks to GPS, we stumbled onto the canal area. Because I had read about the area ahead of time, I knew it was worth trying to park and look around. We drove back and forth for a bit but finally happened upon a parking spot that was legally open (not many of those, by the way). We thoroughly enjoyed taking a little less than an hour wandering around and seeing the interesting architecture and beautiful plant life. If I have the opportunity, I'd like to go back at night. By the way, I saw signs for parking that were up to $10 and several blocks away. I recommend trying to find a spot on your own first, but if you are really on a time constraint, then just pay the $10 and walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KYgirlinTN

50,The Venice of the West,"The Venice canal area is gorgeous,serene, lush with lovely gardens,sporting brightly colored architectural homes which are very expensive.Whoever heard of an architect building in a second rate area? AND the ducks are BAAAAK..quack! quack! Someone moved them out when they were cleaning the canals. I was simply furious. Who they did not move however, was a huge goose, who, on occasion, flung his wings wide so you couldn't pass and hissed in one's face for trespassing on his walkway. I knew what was coming,and took off running, But his short little legs ran faster than mine and he attacked me from behind with a good sharp, well ""Goose"". I looked back and he was sashaying off in the opposite direction looking around sternly for any other miscreant to award with their just deserts! There are many quaint white bridges, lots of scarlet bougainvillea, strange glowing succulents and various trees. If you are there on a weekend check yard sales (CL)on the little side streets(look on the map).You can usually find some really nice finds to remind you of this little Venice. As they say on Craig's list ""be respectful of the neighbors'' and explore quietly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7453DTmarkk
40,Neat view and walk,If you have free time in your schedule you should visit the Venice Canals Walkway in Santa Monica. It's a beautiful neighboorhood with neat houses around a maze of canals. The walk will take you less than an hour but you will be able to see almost everything there is.P.S.Try to Zig-Zag the streets so you cand admire all the angles and routes available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarianoN_11
40,Oh The Potential,"In about 1902 Kinney's dream of creating the Venice of America held such great promise, but like early Miami Beach 3000-miles to the east along the Atlantic it was ill-timed and quickly fell into anything but a paradise.For almost a century the Grand and periphery canals were not much more than empty or near empty sewers ringed by ramshack cottages.Today Kinney's grand plan has at least partially come to fruition. It is a nice walk and worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5112CDrichards

40,More Amsterdam than Venice but still charming,"Tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney had a dream to turn this part of LA into a mini-Venice, so he had canals built over an area roughly four times what you see now. This was back in 1905 when such flights of fancy were encouraged in light of LA's burgeoning role as the American dream, and his idyllic dream lasted until 1924 when automobiles were taking over and roads were needed as a result. Most of the canals were filled in with concrete except for this small neighborhood where six small canals remain. They were saved simply because the contractor went bankrupt. I was aware of their existence but assumed they were dilapidated and wasn't all that motivated to see them until I saw them featured on a public TV travel show. It looked quite idyllic.When my partner and I strolled toward the boardwalk, we made our way to the canals quite easily right after crossing Abbot Kinney Blvd (...oh yes, his legacy continues). What's nice is that a free pathway skirts the canals on both sides, so you can stroll without bothering the residents. There are at least two footbridges per canal, each with a unique look, so it was easy to traverse the neighborhood and be a looky-loo at some of the pricier-looking homes. Gondolas of yore have been supplanted by plastic canoes, and 4th of July barbecue parties were not making me want to sing ""O Sole Mio"". However, I could see another sequel to ""Chinatown"" set here, this time focusing on JJ Gittes' efforts to trap a shady real estate developer for drowning his cheating wife. ""Forget it, Jake, it's Venice.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed_Uyeshima

We parked in a side street, and it did take about 10 minutes of driving around, to find a space. Then you need about an hour to have a really good look at the canals. I think it's a must see if you're in the area. I might even rent one for a few days one day - we saw a few parties who had done that.

50,Beautiful,"Do your research before you come so that you really know what you are looking at when you get here. You will appreciate it so much more. There is a lot of information online, and with just a few minutes of browsing you will be able to spot features and places from the past that would otherwise go unnoticed.Like why there is a huge roundabout on Grand Blvd with a gondola on it. That used to be the old swimming lagoon, and Grand was a major canal. I was pretty cold on the Venice Beach area itself, but just by turning a corner you are here in another place and time. Even the locals seem nice, and actually wave when you drive past.The canal area was originally much larger, but much of it was later back filled and is now gone, however remnants remain if you know what to look for. The original engineering project was quite massive in scope, but flawed in its execution. Even today such a project would be a huge undertaking with modern technology, but back then most of the construction was done by hand. Incredibly back breaking work.This is a world class historical district, and you can tell that most people have no idea what is right under their feet. When you have those discussions with people about what you would do if you won the lottery, you talk about this and that, blah, blah. I would definitely buy a house here.

They are absolutely stunning.We travelled here while staying nearby, and it was well worth the effort. The canals have quite a history and have been around for close to a century now. Enter at the Main Canal and then snake your way up each side of the canals for a beautiful view of the water, but also the incredible houses that line the canals. There are so many picturesque homes to see along this walk that it's quite remarkable.While it's reminiscent of Venice with the decorated white bridges and occasional gondala, don't be mistaken, this is a far more modern version, with some seriously expensive households in the area. Many celebrities live along these canals and it's not hard to see why as it's a very serene and peaceful area that's quite far removed from the hustle and bustle of the main beach boulevard.The walkways are too narrow for bikes, and you might get the occasional jogger trying to push past, but overall it's surprisingly quiet.Many homes take incredible care of their gardens and there are some wonderfully eccentric and highly decorative courtyards to peer into. I particularly love all the use of string lights and tree lamps used to add to the already magical atmosphere.If I could afford it, I'd definitely be looking to buy - but as one home reads 'eat your heart out, not for sale', and that pretty much sums it up because property here doesn't go up for sale very often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChantalTee
30,Nice calm walk,This is a nice change from the usual hustle and bustle of LA. It's a nice quiet walk along the canals with lots of old beautiful houses. Not a very extensive walk and wouldn't exactly say it's worth a visit unless at this end of Venice beach anyways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachiepagan

40,Lovely area of town for a walk,"It's lovely to walk around the canals near Venice Beach and a nice respite from the busy boardwalk. It's probably not worth making a trip here just to walk around the canals, but a nice way to spend some time if you're already in the area. It's fun to look at all the different houses and explore at your own pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephandgio_m

40,Pleasant Diversion From The Beach,The Venice Canals are worth a visit when the area is not busy. You can take a peaceful stroll and experience a totally different aspect of Venice. The homes and gardens are interesting and it is and OK way to spend some time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonLethbridge
50,So peaceful and different from the beach boardwalk,"So peaceful and different from the beach boardwalk it is a must-see. It will change your idea about Venice beach area.

You will be nicely surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LasLuces
20,Glorified gutter water,"We found this place when searching for stroller walk friendly places. I don't remember the website who made the recommendation, and that's a good thing. Whoever recommended this should be drawn here on foot and forced to smell the water. It's pretty foul and you can tell from a distance. This place, isn't worth putting in comparison with the real Venice. Do yourself a favor and stay away. It looked kind of cool when I saw in the TV series Bosch, so I will give it 2 stars for that",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VamsiK859
30,Not what I expected,It's a good walk but basically you are walking behind someone else's house that are built along the canals. The canals seem to be drying out because of the drought but this walkway isn't my cup of tea. I'd rather walk by the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jomama_Fosho

30,A surprise to visit and walk though,"Not what we expected to find in the middle of Venice.These houses are located near the beach and in the reclaimed canals from the marshland Venice once was. It is fun to walk the walkways along the canal and see the houses, some of which embrace their tourist visitors with neat yards and lights.If you are near Venice Beach and want to walk along something surprising, check out the Venice Canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhU4916TC
40,A Pretty Oasis Of Tranquility,"Not the first place people will think of when travelling to Venice, sure the beach and boardwalk are cool then there's the Santa Monica pier, BUT this is a sweet little stroll for about an hour away from the hustle and bustle. Nice to hear the sounds of ducks, you wouldn't think you was in LA. We enjoyed it for what it is; a nice tranquil setting that's pretty where you can chill out whilst wondering how much each home must cost! Unique little place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtripper64
40,"A different, cool kind of suburb","We kind of stumbled onto this area by accident, but it was pretty cool to see what it’d be like to live in a tight neighborhood with nice, interesting homes with narrow canals as your ""backyard."" Several varieties of plants and flowers lined the walkways, and it was very different from most any other American suburb. Wandering around the canals for a good hour will allow you to observe some neat birdlife and be greeted by friendly, domestic felines.Within walking distance of Venice Beach. You can park your vehicle at the public lot across from the Marriott Marina Del Rey. Check it out if you haven't been and are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aerofaze
30,A little on the dirty side,to be fair I wasn't all that impressed with the canal walkway. The canal itself was a little green and had some rubbish in it. Overall I would have expected it to be cleaner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/559adenk
30,"Pretty, but not essential","I wanted to spend the morning at Venice and decided to walk through the canals after spending some time at the beach. The houses and gardens are beautiful, and it is interesting to see how each property has been built around this man-made canal system.That said, I don't think I would go back. The canals are a nice place to wander for a short while, but I didn't think there was anything terribly spectacular about them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinetv

50,Serenity,Absolutely gorgeous stroll along the banks of the Canals. Missed this the first time we visited Venice Beach. Tour guide didn't even mention them.

40,A hidden gem,"I've been to Venice Beach before, but due to a parking error, we wound up walking the canals! What a fortunate error!

50,"Beautiful, Tranquil Walk in Venice Beach","I live near here so I walk through the Canals almost daily. Spring will bring you fragrant flowers and early evenings will get you a peak INSIDE some Mutli-Dollar homes and its furnishings :-) Residents don't really mind, just PLEASE DON'T PICK THE FLOWERS and a great place to walk you dogs too. Just CURB your dogs. Easy Access from the South Venice public parking to Washington Blvd where you'll find some really good restaurants. For a good workout, just keep going from Canal to Canal and you'll log in at least a half mile on your pedometer. Simply lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilg463
50,Incredible walk,"This neighborhood is so beautiful. You could spend hours walking around the canals and taking all the beauty in. There are little bridges over the water, birds everywhere, and every house is more unique than the next. The houses are stunning and lovely to look at. There are little boats scattered throughout the canals. It's such a departure from the Venice beach area. Love coming here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
50,Wonderfully Interesting!,"Read your history on how these homes on the canals were brought to today. So interesting that most of the area was filled with canals!!! Wouldn't that be wonderful!! We rented beach cruisers right from the guys in the parking lot right on the beach. Then road over to the canals and walked our bikes. No bike riding but I we didn't have locks so we tried not to take up too much of the path... And it was nice to walk the paths bath and forth then hope on our bikes and ride down the path all the way past Santa Monica Pier. I would consider renting the bikes after walking the canals next time. But the neighbors that live there seem to be fairly friendly if you're polite. We also stopped for a hamburger along the road. Overall, perfect afternoon. Do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dafoush

50,Iconic Los Angeles,"This is the best reward for your effort to walk along Venice Beach. Great homes and a very pleasant stroll. Venice beach itself is a bit kitschy, but seeing this idea of Abbot Kinney still alive an pumping is pretty kewl! I am a Los Angeles local, and enjoyed seeing this very much. There is a parking lot that is CASH only nearby. We paid $8.00. In fact, Venice in general is very old school and is a cash only place. Be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/928katherinek
40,Venice Canals - Who Knew?,We went to Venice to buy touristy t-shirts for a family member living overseas. Before we left Venice I wanted to find the canals and see if it was worth walking around. Don't go here thinking you are going to find Venice Italy. This is So Cal and the canals with the homes are beautiful. Very quaint and unexpected find away from Ocean Ave and the weirdness.

30,A nice place to stroll,"We didn't spend a lot of time here as we were waiting for our flight from LAX, but took the opportunity to stroll around here. The homes were close together, but still pretty large. Not much lawn, but the number of roof-top patios made up for it. Many varied styles of homes, which created a nice eclectic hodge-podge community. Like how there were bridges connecting areas so you could walk around. Enjoyed seeing the boats berthed at the homes, and could imagine the residents paddling around the neighborhood. Would love to come back and see more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471davem
40,A complete contrast from venice beach,"After walking along the beach, i expected the Venice canals to be similar, full of tourists and a bit tacky. How wrong could I be.

A photographers dream!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
50,Charming,I had read about these prior to our L.A. trip and was intrigued. It's worth it if you are driving to the beach nearby. These walkways are just south of Venice Beach and you may find on street parking nearby and then walk through the canal walkways to the beach. They extend several blocks and the canals have 'docks' with paddle boats and kayaks. You walk over bridges to get to the connecting sidewalks. It appears that many people are creating extravagant gardens and some places even have rooftop decks to look at the ocean. It is not tacky - it's quite charming and unexpected. Worth a look if you are nearby!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytravelerfromnva

Since he lived in Amsterdam for years he could understand that this is a pretty odd sightseeing tour for Sutch people in that big city of LA.

There are countless viewpoints where every house has a different style. And every block has the old and the new. A quaint bungalow with beautiful gardens is next to a ultra modern with a minimal, but appropriate landscaping. And all of these houses are within 5 to 15 feet of where you are walking.And all are on both sides of the canals.Just a great visual and relaxing excursion in the Santa Monica/Venice Beach area.Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allen727286

40,"Hidden Gem, Miniature Venice","I first found out about this place on TripAdvisor, and couldn't wait to visit there. My parents and I first went to Venice beach, which was too crowded and not clean, we were kind of disappointed.Since Venice Canal is only a few miles away from the beach, we didn't hold our hopes high for it. I drove into this neighborhood, with houses built very close to each other, narrow streets and few parking spot. After we parked, we walked to the place, it seems like another world after entering the area. Distinctive and well-designed houses along the little canal, you can tell the canal was artificially built, very shallow, but certainly makes this place fairy tale like. It was very quiet, various sorts of plants decorated the houses and walkway. It's very romantic as well, with vintage bridge crossing the canal, and its image reflected very clearly on the surface of the water. This place is like a beautiful picture in real life.Big thumb up for this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liangzih
50,BOTANICAL PARADISE!!,"The Venice Canals are breathtaking! Photo's do NOT do this beautiful place justice. Its so peaceful and tranquil. I bought a little bottle of champagne from the liquer store next to the canals and walked through the canals NEVER FEELING HAPPIER. I found a place to sit and put my feet in the cool water, listening to Fiona Apple on my Android phone.. the gongola's were so cool, I saw a couple paddling. I felt like I was in Madonna's video LIKE A VIRGIN! .. there are many beautiful flowers and bungalow's...I wish I was so fortunate to have money and live there.. The only fall back was the homless people. They do not bother anyone but I feel they should be in mental hospitals, NOT in a place that are peoples homes! I can not convey the beauty of the canals.. it is even more amazing at night, all lit up.. water sparking.. ohhhhhhh i love you VENICE!!!!!! I get chills thinking about going back!

50,Amazing!,"We walked for over an hour up and down the canal walkways. Our teenage daughter took over 100 pictures and I took probably 50. Between the gorgeous houses, interesting birds, beautiful flowers and plants, it was AMAZING! Who would have thought this quiet place could exist amongst all of the hustle and bustle and craziness not that far away.Talk a walk - you'll be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50Countries46States
50,A hidden gem in Los Angeles,"You won't feel like you're in Los Angeles at the Venice Canals Walkway.I visited a few weeks ago for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's much different from all the hustle and bustle found at Venice Beach. It's a serene spot that's perfect for a walk. The houses are quite intriguing as well, which is what I paid most attention to while I was there.I'm surprised this place isn't hyped up as much as others, but at the same time that's a good thing so you have enough space to walk around, as the walkways are narrow.I'll definitely be taking visitors to this place in the future. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agnesc409
50,Beautiful walk,"Unlike Venice Beach, this really is worth the detour. You'll find this up market area situated behind the tacky Venice Beach. It comprises around a 3 mile grid of canals with some really beautiful properties. It makes a great walk over a number of inter-connecting pathways and bridges; and, surprisingly, one that doesn't seem to attract many visitors. But it's definitely a part of LA to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex
30,Worth an hour if you are bored,Having read about the Venice area in various crime novels I was keen to see them for real. Parking in the area is a premium and we ended up on a meter which wasn't hugely expensive. The canals themselves are interesting but this is not that picturesque more unusual. There are lots of residences that have canal frontage and that's it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwightDEisenhower
50,"WOW! Fantastic place, unique homes!","This is a hidden gem of a place. Apparently there isn't one canal, there were a few canals with beautiful, unique, charming cottages up and down the canals. We just wandered around a few of the canals to soak up the beauty of this place. We arrived around sunset so as to catch some good light for photos. This place didn't disappoint. Each home along the canal was customized and just awesome. I've traveled plenty of places, including overseas, and there is nothing like the Venice Canals walkway. We were enjoying the serenity of the place but a few obnoxious people who were excessively loud ruined the peace.It's important to bear in mind that this is a neighborhood with private homes. So be curtsey and mindful to respect peoples homes. Otherwise you will ruin future opportunities for others to visit. If I could choose one place to live in California, it would be somewhere along these canals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8umble8ee
50,Italy experience in Los Angeles,This area in the heart of LA takes you back in time to an area in Italy where there are also canals. The real Venice Canals in Italy are more grand but this is pretty nice for Los Angeles. Well worth the trip and best if you park the car and walk around leisurely on foot. There is lots of parking around but there are no facilities anywhere. The houses and gardens are very well kept and there are a lot of different styles of homes. The canal is clean and is not very deep. There are small bridges all over the place so you can cross back and forth for that perfect picture no matter where. You can walk to Venice Beach in 5 minutes from there. Well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonialouish
50,"""Go at Christmas!""",The people who live on the canals do a remarkable job of decorating their homes and the bridges over the Christmas holidays. We go every year and bring friends or family. First timers are always amazed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharterOneTwo
40,Pretty area,"We wanted to stop at Venice and walk around, but unfortunately there was not enough time. Instead we ended up doing a quick drive through the Venice canals. They were certainly pretty and are something you would not expect to find in a big city. It was worth a quick stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radx4
50,hidden gem,It is a very pleasant walk. We spent around hour and something or two just looking around at the beautiful houses and the cute ducks swimming in the water. It is a hidden gem and it is worthy the visit :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elena0210
40,Loved it!,Lovely walk by the canal. Loved the very different kinds of architecture and the peaceful water.Take an hour to just hang around and take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emiliemag_YYC
50,An Island of Quiet,"Well, not really an island since it's a network of canals. But you get the idea. All types of houses along these canals: Big, small, old, new, well-kept, tired-looking. There's some very interesting architecture along with everyday stuff. I'd love to live here but I believe I'd need to win the Lotto in order to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grundoon
40,Interesting walk,Neat place to visit for a nice walk over an hour or so. Combine this with venice boardwalk and a nice meal and a drink on main Street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RustyShaklef0rd
50,"Lovely, romantic diversion from city life","We visited this remarkable walkway after a long cross-country plane ride where we picked up 3 hours of daylight and really needed to walk off the plane-seat paralysis. Oh, what a treat! The canals are between Venice and Marina del Mar, about a $20 cab ride from LAX or a couple of dollars on 2 buses, if you get really nice Angelinos to direct you and a good map to enter the walkway. Once there, the architecture is a joy--from the humble cottages that were first there in the 1920's to the outlandish tudor or gothic palaces, grand mediterranean villas and minimalist glass contemporaries . Each one has a small garden and usually a dock, and as a visitor, you are almost part of their family barbecue. It seemed to me to be the neighborly intimacy of a bygone age. This is strictly residential, so no bathrooms or restrooms. But there is a superb inespensive Italian restaurant on one of the streets that border the canals, Canoli Cafe on Washington Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann2009CT
50,Relaxing family walk,"My husband, son and I had a great time walking around the canals. I would defiantly recommend taking an afternoon to walk around here, such interesting and gorgeous homes. Also it's a very relaxing atmosphere. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't crowded like everywhere else in the area. After the walk we had lunch at Canali Cafe, which I also recommend their pumpkin ravioli is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazuhmen
40,The quiet side of Venice is hidden treasure,"For an unexpected change of pace visiting Venice Beach, take sone time to wander along the picturesque canals. I admit, I was intrigued after watching the movie ""Valentine's Day"" and wondering where this peaceful area was in LA with quiet canals and sweet bridges. We found street parking on Ocean Ave. and from there meandered the walkways all along the canals, checking out the rear views of the many homes jammed into the area. Some of the residences have a vintage feel, others are new, modern construction. Didn't take more than a 1/2 hour or so, but a lovely respite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishG87
40,Romantic Walk with that special someone; bring camera; bring water,"They say the layout was designed after Venice Italy. I have not been there. This is a residential area. So, there is no business, no food trucks, no bathrooms, etc. This is nice place to walk and see the nice shallow water and canoes everywhere. You can spend several hours here with a loved one standing on the bridges or holding hands and walking very slow. Just keep in mind no bathrooms, no food and very few tourists. The main issue will be parking. You will have to find a place to park or pay the $15.00 or $20.00 for public parking. There are places to park you may have to walk up to three blocks but it is worth it to do street parking versus being stuck in a lot. The view is nice. The walk is easy. A few the walkway bridges are step so watch your toes if you wear flip flops. I would recommend this place early morning, early afternoon but not really in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr
50,not expected!,Such a nice reprieve from the craziness of Venice beach. Beautiful homes! The canals were not busy and people walking around were pleasantly strolling. I think some of the movie Valentines Day was filmed here... so pretty :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/little_rigger
50,A Beautiful Hidden Gem of Los Angeles,"If you see yourself as a traveller, not a tourist, the Venice Beach Canals Walkway in Venice near L.A. is a must see for you. Venice Canals Walkway is situated in a private neighbourhood surrounded with bridges, canals, and quaint homes. It is a quiet oasis away from the traffic jam and crowded tourist places in L.A. An excellent place for couples and a romantic stroll. So keep this place a secret gem before more L.A. tourists find out about Venice Canals Walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2CanadianTravellers
40,Beautiful walk,We were on vacation with our 9 year old and 13 year old. We were on our way to Venice Beach and made a quick stop to walk around the canals. Beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/76darlaa
40,"Very pretty, quiet area","We quickly walked through here and it was lovely. Not like Venice in Italy of course, but I dont think it's meant to be an exact copy anyway. It was very quiet and peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABristol82
50,Great Place to Walk After Getting Off a Plane at LAX,"The Canals are peaceful, quiet and beautiful. The perfect place to stretch your legs after a long plane ride. The Canals are about 15 minutes north of LAX. See cutting edge architecture (David Hertz, Steve Ehrlich, Glen Irani architects), fanciful architecture, 1900's era cottages, and some houses that ought not to have been built. Park on Washington, 28th, or in one of the parking lots on Venice Blvd. There is great bird life: ducks, egrets, herons, and in the winter - pelicans. After your walk, visit one of the great restaurants on Washington Blvd. (e.g. Canali Cafe, Kaya Sushi) in the Marina (e.g. Killer Shrimp or Best Western Hotel's restaurant), or on Abbot Kinney (e.g. a food truck, Joe's Cafe, Gjelina or Hal's). If you have children under 4, there is a small, charming park on Linnie Canal and Dell Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janejets0n
40,Well Worth the Walk,"This really was a hidden gem and worth the 15 minute detour if you're on Venice beach. It's an amazing area, which you really don't expect to find, the properties along the canals are fabulous and it 's so tranquil to just stroll along wishing you owned a property here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanMarch
40,Calm Oasis,We decided to check out the canal area based on reviews. We were not disappointed. Even the kids (12 and 10) enjoyed walking around the quiet pathways. Homes are a blend of modern and traditional. Fun to stroll around and get away from the craziness of Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrpleGrl
50,Hidden gem,"Hidden between busy Venice and Washington Boulevards, this unexpected, peaceful enclave is a great place to walk and relax; we do it all the time, for many years now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanZ874
50,Lovely oasis,"Peace and calm away from the frenetic boardwalk. Beautiful houses, gardens and serenity. Highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan179
50,Absolutely charming little neighborhood,"Real estate speculator Abbott Kinney developed Venice, CA. as a small city of canals. Pollution and poor water management caused city of L.A. to pave over most of the canals, except in this little enclave. Here you have funky frame shacks sitting next to multi-million-dollar McMansions -- all on tiny lots facing a canal. It's the most picturesque community in all of L.A., I think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bagan
30,"There are canals, but a bit voyeuristic","A calm walk away from the busy beach and restaurants in the area and a great way to see some of the amazing homes along the canals. Homes that are practically in the canal to some ultra modern homes seemingly made of only glass.Definitely voyeuristic at times as while your walking you can practically touch the side of some of the homes and you attract the gaze of all of the home owners in their yards, but they had to expect it as they moved there.So enjoy the experience and don't be put off walking past the endless barbecues and glass houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
40,Venice Canals Walkway Just steps away from the beach,"The Venice canal walkways are the perfect diversion from the crazy pace of Venice Beach. While the Venice Beach ""boardwalk"" sports a never ending stream of people from all, and I mean all, types of life, the Canal Walkway are a perfect place to escape and enjoy the tranquility of some of the most beautiful back yards you have ever seen. This combined with some of the most stunning architecture makes for an overall wonderfully relaxing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joe651
50,Diamond in the rough!!!,"Saw an Instagram photo of the canals and couldn't believe it. I was there tonight to see it with my own eyes and they were stunning! Literally a block away from the insanity that is Venice Beach, there are these lovely, quite canals with their colored boats and very eclectic mixture of homes...all stunning but different. I can't wait to return to spend more time here! A must see...and it is less than 10 mins from Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spendacone
50,Beautiful calming place,"I was recently in Venice visiting friends and they asked if I had seen the Venice Canals? As I hadn't even heard of them, let alone seen them, we made the trip after breakfast and I was simply amazed.In the corner between Pacific Avenue and North and South Venice Boulevard, which is in effect one block back from the beach, you will find the Venice Canals. If your in Venice Beach and you don't come and have a walk around, your missing something as its a tranquil calming oasis in what can be a full on side show.Strolling along the pathways along the canals, admiring the beautiful houses built along the banks and wondering who lives there, could become my next past time its so relaxing.Keep in mind as you look at, what can be quite modest sized houses, that the minimum value of these is most likely about $1 million and many are in the $3-$4 million bracket. You don't get much for your buck around here but looking at the very special neighborhood, you can understand why if you have that kind of money, you might want to live here. In a way it reminds me of being in The Keys, but smarter.If you have an hour or so to spend, do come and have a walk around, its well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rinkydinkpinkpanther
40,Venice Canals,It is a nice place to stroll and relax. It was peaceful and just looking at the houses and their unique structures and how some are painted is worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelforfun2009
50,Fantastic neighbourhood,"Once we found the footpath to the canals we were amazed at how only one block away was Venice Beach. The two share a name but appear totally different in nature. It was peaceful to walk the canals, admiring peoples homes and gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidUnitedKingdom
50,Peace and Quiet...ahhh!,You can get a nice taste of what the canals are like with a 1-mile round trip from the intersection of the Grand Canal at Washington (near Canali Cafe). We found it to be a very peaceful (and surprisingly quiet) escape. The homes are typically quite modest looking but their location is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlumniGuy
50,You've got to enjoy the unusual!,"A walk down Venice Beach is a true blast from the past. It is a 60's time warp with lots of 'free spirits' and gorgeous view of the beach and the Pacific ocean. When in LA, it is a must see! Don't deny yourself the pleasure of the unusual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PegTucson_AZ
50,Charming and relaxing,"With its European feel and the quaint wooden bridges spanning the canals, this is a part of Venice that is as delightful as it is unexpected. You can meander the walkways over the different canals at your own pace, enjoying the scenery - ducks, foliage - as well as the beautiful homes. If you know someone who lives there borrow a rowboat, kayak or canoe for a leisurely exploration. And if you have little ones, don't forget the Duck Park on Dell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drivingmisssarah
40,Good alternative to Muscle Beach,"If you are looking for something off the beaten path, unique without the weird, then take a walk along the Venice Canals. We loved the gardens and bridges and the peace and quiet. It was refreshing after a lot of time in the car getting from point A to B.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650JulieS650
30,The Venice exception,"Venice is very eclectic and as you might expect full of strange characters. Its pretty much a collection of cheesy venues. We used a local docent, Johnathan Kaplan who did a great job of sharing the history of his city. It was actually very interesting. Even though the city name is ""Venice"" I did not associate this city with actual canals. While the main body of canals no longer exist, a secondary canal system in fact provides a very pleasant walk through a neighborhood of unique homes built right on the canal system. It is well worth the walk and a pleasant break from the ""strangeness"" of Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shopbean
50,Retreat in the city,"My first introduction to Venice was through Venice Beach. While I loved seeing the drum circles, freak shows, and ""green"" doctors, this was definitely a very pleasant break from that culture.The homes along the canals are notable for their varied architecture. They are all gorgeous beach homes, and I love seeing the individual style of each house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyssa_boone
40,Just do it,Lovely casual walk around the canals. This is not normally on the tourist map but well worth the little extra time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385davidw385
30,strange neighborhood,The canals are small and sometimes littered up with debris. hopefully they cleaned this place up a little since i walked there last summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23Jacks23
40,Venice canals and the beach etc,"The walk along the canals is a delightful way to spend some time in the Other Venice and most of the gardens are interesting. I have always found something different to catch my eye on every visit. It is very tranquil and there are some of the houses are quite unique. Go on down to the beach and walk along the pier. The sea air is perfume to this landlocked former seaside dweller .On a clear day the snow caps are visible in the distance when you walk back from the end and if you are lucky a pod of dolphins might swim by doing their acrobatics in their natural setting. Thank heaven there are no man made ' Attractions' and canned music just the sea, the fishermen and the distant mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aileenTorontoCanada
50,It's the Beach,"If your tired of being in the same old environment and want to travel but can't afford it, take a bike ride to Venice Canals. It will have you believing that you have escaped to another country. That is.. if your good at lying to yourself. It is a change of scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rejuvinateyrslf
50,Quiet cute walkway,"One of my favorite places in LA.There are pop color houses and flowers, but very quiet and nice place to take a walk.We had engagement photo session here.It was not sunshine day, but still very picture like location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Po_Teletubbies

30,Not what i expected.,It was very interesting to walk along the canals and see the homes that were there. It was a little dissappointing. The area around the canals is so built up it just doesn't have the magical feeling it had years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishfarmfamily
40,Relaxing walk among the mayhem...,Nice easy stroll along walkways and over the bridges. Helped work off lunch from C & O Trattoria. Lots to see and a very wide range of houses to look at. We entered off Washington and worked our way to the main Venice Beach area. The tree with all the old house lights in it was very unique and we are going to try and get back at night when it is lit up. The few residents we came across were friendly considering that they have all the tourists. Beautiful setting on a sunny Saturday on Presidents Day weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAN-BC-Traveller
20,Not the Venice we think it will be -- kind of smelly and dodgy.,This is not a nice place to walk around. It's close to questionable areas in Vencie. So it's not really safe. Go to Naples in Long Beach for a cute canals walk. Much safer and more fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashu2
40,fun walk away from the beach road,"it's nice to take a walk through the canals and get out at the other side to come back through the beach. the canals are very nice, the houses are amazing and all that is left is to be jealous of those who live here everyday. parking in one of the small streets just before the canals start is easy, especially on Sunday. if look for the set from ""californications"" it's not on the canals at all... walk for a few minutes to the other side of the beach and find hank's old place in 26 Brooks Ave, and Karen place with bill on 2420 McKinley Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amiroi
50,Nice evening stroll,Most of the residents know they are living in a fishbowl so they keep the lights on and drapes open in the early evenings. Nice evening stroll on a mild autumn night holding hands with your sweatheart and see all the houses that look like they belong on Architectural Digest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulB238

40,Worth your time because of the History and escape from the Venice Beach Boardwalk.,"Reading some of these negative reviews is kind of funny. People give negative reviews based on their experience on the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Venice Beach is the 2nd most visited and touristy visit in LA. Yes, there are crazy people. Yes we have a homeless problem. Know what you're in for when you visit. Fri is the best day to visit both. You avoid weekend crowds/parking and the water level of the canals are at the highest level. A nice quiet escape from the madness of the Venice Beach boardwalk. All the homes are different and unique. Just because these canals are not like the Venice Italy canals, doesn't mean that they're not worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/borat4prez

Someone said in a review that it's a piece of Europe in the middle of LA.. coming from an English person, who's been to Venice in Italy more than once, this is NOTHING LIKE Europe, or Venice for that matter. It's got more in common with the LA storm drains!Of all the exciting places to go, and fun things to do in LA, and people are recommending this as one of the top attractions?

40,Best stroll in Venice.,"If you are with your sweetheart, your dogs or just yourself, this is a beautiful, unusual stroll. The care that was taken in designing this little oasis is worth experiencing once. You will marvel at how and why people are willing to live so exposed to so much foot traffic! Lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zeppo33
40,Odd and attractive,Some really cool architecture in unlikely surroundings . A peaceful oasis in the centre of LA. Try and find a map to find your way around because there's not much information when you find the canals! But worth searching out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DW111
40,Small-Scale Charm,"Probably not worth the time unless you love to look at residential architecture, but if you do (and I do--just ask my patient husband), you will appreciate this charming little neighborhood with it's ""Venetian"" canals. As other reviewers have pointed out, you can stroll around in an hour or less, and it's a lovely alternative to the carnival atmophere of the beach.Architectural styles range from cottage to contemporary on a pretty water setting. Who knows? You might just pick up a few ideas to implement back at the ranch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pink_Azalea429
10,Don't waste your time,While only 10miles from LA. The drive is not worth it. The best part of our trip was taking a nap in the safety of our rental car. The canals look like a bunch of exposed sewer lines. And smell like it to boot. We decided to try and 'explore' Venice Beach. Not a good idea....unless you want to use substances to help you 'explore your mind'.Key point: Do not plan on going here. It is a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilaandjon
40,Ahhh Venice,This is how the area inherited its namesake after the Italian Venice but also a very quiet and tranquil area and those fortunate enough to live on the canals have something to invite friends over to see for themselves...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGoneLocal
40,Don't miss this on your visit to Venice Beach,"This is the history of something that was supposed to be more than it is, the ""Venice of America."" Ok, that didn't happen, but it's still cool. It doesn't take more than 30 minutes to stroll through the neighborhood of canals and get a California flavored Venice with palm trees and beautifully colored homes. I wouldn't make a special trip to the canals unless unless I was planning on seeing Venice Beach bordwalk - but that's a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ICNiT
50,Worth it - really nice!,"Park on Venice Blvd, walk in to this unique area of LA. We had lots of fun walking and gawking. Not crowded at all, and really pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobField
50,a unique oasis,"We recently stayed in Venice and took several walks through this peaceful oasis. Another reviewer complained about no parking, which is true, but if you are already at Venice Beach, it's worth the short walk to the canals. The water itself isn't much to look at, but if you enjoy walking, looking at pretty gardens and seeing a wide variety of architecture from humble cottages to large modern magazine-worthy houses, this walk is for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraC214
40,A pleasant diversion,This is a nice quiet walk away from the bustle of Venice Beach. There are a variety of house styles along the canals to look at and various bridges to cross. There are some film locations to spot if you look them up. We parked at the top of Washington on a meter (cheap enough) and walked along the main canal for about an hour. That's all the time you'd need but we were glad we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turnhill
40,Great escape,It's nothing like its Italian name twin but it sure is worth the time. Take the easy tour by car across the narrow bridges or do it by bike. The latter of the two will give you a greater impression of the canals. It's not crowded like almost every nearby street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Windfeld-C
30,Have a look wheile in Venice Beach,Better than the Broadwalk. Quiet area. But it is just houses around canals (manmade obviously). A few bridges across to have your photo.Have a look while in Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dadofnog
40,A Hidden Gem,Turn left at the end of the Madness on ther Boardwalk go straight ahead and i am sure i turned right after 3 streets and there it is. If you like looking at houses of the rich and famous there are some beautiful properties in a fantastic location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManchesterJeterfan
50,Like real life Short Cuts...,"This place is totally delightful. Take an early evening stroll through the canals to make the most of it, though. That way you see the funky people as well as the funky architecture. It feels like a walk through Robert Altman's Short Cuts, hearing different snatches of conversation and different scenes and scenarios. I wouldn't make a massive journey to get here and do this, but as we were staying nearby it made for an entertaining evening event. And such a drastic difference from what you'd expect from LA. I love the Venice Canals. I went on to read about Abbott Kinney, what an amazing guy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
30,Expected more,"Reviews on this website hyped up expectations, but all I saw was canals that were almost running dry and a few ducks wading.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desmondlin
40,Hidden gem,"Loved walking around the canals, and I guess my only criticism would be why there hasn't been more effort to make this more tourist friendly e.g. pedal boats, kayaks. Most of the boats we saw looked as if they'd not been used for years and it just seemed a shame that such a beautiful network of canals didn't appear to be in actual use.Some lovely, very arty houses in this area as well. Well worthy of an hour or two strolling along the banks of the canal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Essexboyz123

50,"Wonderful ! Here, everything exudes tranquility.","A few meters from the sea and long beaches of Venice Beach, where tourists flock, come enjoy the tranquility of the place and you walk along the very discreet canals of Venice. Cross the small bridge spanning in white wood. Many beautiful photos to take, for the houses but also the flowers that grow in abundance in many colors. Respect the silence of places because it is a haven not yet privatized and it would have to rest on much longer. Allow an hour's walk if you want to see everything. Watch birds or colored boats, guess which star of TV series lives behind the facade of a house persimmon wood ...If you want more activities, go to the more noisy Venice Beach, a few meters away, only one road to cross: restaurants, tattoo artists, vendors of clothing or gadgets, palm readers, jewelry, incense, ice cream and improvised music by street musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madeinamericagirl

30,Not really a walkway,"I never had understood the attraction to this rather eclectic, bohemian neighborhood. This place has always seemed rather seedy. You can see the houses from the bridges, but where do you park? Where do you walk? There is not a real walkway. What I have seen from the bridge is dirty, stagnant water and ducks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetnDandy
40,Interesting!,This place is so unique. This is like mini Venice in Europe. The place gives us a very peaceful atmosphere and the houses are cute. The walkway is very well maintained and we walked comfortably while enjoying the calm scenery. We took lots of pictures there and have not regretted driving to Venice just to see this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grace_cheung
40,pretty,"not much to do here but walk and take in the scenery, but you are ony a couple minutes away from the walkway on the beach and Muscle Beach, and it's relaxing...wish I could live there..also you are too far from a wonderful restaurant called Baby Blues BBQ - yummy!!!! A hole in the wall that is very tasty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteH951

40,Hidden Gem...,"This area is very small but beautiful. It's a great little neighborhood to walk around in and enjoy the quaint homes on the canal. There's a path between the homes and the canal you can walk. There are little gates to access the canal if you have a kayak. Very close to Venice Beach but feels very peaceful and quiet, a world away from the LA chaos. Worth a short visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadomom2
40,Canals Not Banal :),"The Venice Canals are a must see for friends visiting L.A. I bring them to the Canals and we walk the dirt walk way to the end and return down the walkway/""alley"".This is a VERY SAFE walk. I've been visiting the Canals with my daughter since she was in elementary school and she's now in the 11th grade.What is impressive is the architecture and the massive sizes of the homes. They are gorgeous and my friends and I (my daughter included) fantasize about living in one of the homes. Is the water beautiful, not at all. Is it a bit dusty, oh yes.This is a FREE event, simply park at the marina entrance and pay a minimal fee a the meter ($0.75) and walk, talk and enjoy.Wear casual clothes and sneakers or walking shoes. Think hiking, but on flat ground!How do I know? I'm a native Angeleno who has lived in Los Angeles for 42 years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATravelMama

30,Interesting diversion,Quaint residential area off busy Venice Beach. Much quiter area that makes for an interesting walk and is in contrast to the tackiness of Venice Beach itself. Just be aware of all the duck doo on the side walks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLBTraveller
40,"Nice Walks, Cool History and Photo opps","I enjoyed the history of the canals, not named ""Venice"" for nothing, and the ease of exploring them while still being close enough to the beach to not have to drive and find the near impossible parking spot all over again.One of the dozens of little neighborhoods jewels in L.A. where one can get a real feel for the popular, feast or famine, saying - ""In L.A. you can make a million but not a living!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Way better than expected!,"We walked from Santa Monica pier through Venice beach to see the canals. They were worth it (but next time I'd probably call a cab)! They were beautiful!

50,Lovely walk,and very interesting architecture too ! It was cool to see all the different housing styles ~,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeg2012
40,Great Photo Opportunities,"If you didn't know it was here, you could completely miss the Venice Canals. This quaint area of Los Angeles is steeped in history, and it's a marvel that it hasn't been bulldozed down to make way for developments. There's a charming collection of bridges that allow you to navigate a walk around all of the canals. Nice to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here. It's difficult to wander around the canals, without taking a sneak peak glance through peoples front windows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RovingJay
40,Fun neighborhood,"If you are visiting LA the canals can be a fun activity. If you enjoy looking at beautiful homes ~ this is the place for you. It truly is a charming area.Afterwards, you can go to the beach or walk around the trendy street ""Abbot Kinney"". The shopping is expensive but fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DariaG368

30,This was not exactly what I had expected.,"We went on a Sunday morning, which we had been told it would be real busy on Sunday. We did see the canals near where we parked and they were very pretty. We walked out onto the beach and put our feet in the Pacific for the first time. It was very pretty. Then we walked up to the main beach street. It was basically a lot of souvenir shops, marijuana shops, and tattoo places. There seemed to be several homeless type people there too. There were some people selling art they had made. We walked a long time and it was just more of the same. No one was at the Muscle Beach area. It was just not that impressive but maybe we were just too early in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiverCityGirl_12

40,Quaint walking paths along and over the canals,"Wonder off the beach a couple of blocks and down one of the paths between the houses and you come across the venice canals and the gorgeous cottages from ultra modern to more traditional on the Venice canals in LA. We really enjoyed peaking into the gardens and taking in the varied architecture and colours of all the different houses, and the lovely pedestrian bridges. This detour doesn't take too long, and is well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patmum
50,Absolutely beautiful!,"The Canals are beautiful. Although there are only a couple left, they are such a nice site to see. Take a bike tour so that you can get a close-up view of the canals.

30,It's just ok...!,"The water on the canal looks stagnant ... but the view with the houses lining up along the canals looks nice and quite like a post card picture... but I didn't think it looks spectacular... The houses look more interesting as one muses on who and what kind of people might be living in them... But after walking around and looking at the view for a few minutes, I was ready to move on to other attractions... To me, that was very forgettable...!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreySir

40,A walk in LA history,"If you want to walk in L.A.'s past, then Venice Canals walkway is the place to go. You can just envision the gondolas (just like Venice) that used to run up and down the canals. Great people watching...and some wonderful, unusual homes too. Not a great place for a weekend visit as it is much to crowded....go during the week, if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rangodog
40,A glimpse of modern high-society,"I went for a day trip to Venice Beach and also visited the Venice canals. It was quite an amazing sight. The houses are literally built along the waters edge, and are quite pricy from what I was told. You're able to drive over little arch bridges that go over the canals... and you invariably see a film crew along the way shooting something. It was a unique sight that you must take in if you're anywhere near Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virsen

30,A good walk,"This is a walk for socially conscious people so they can see what gentrification is all about, with large ""architectural"" houses squeezed into tiny lots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmanuelY
50,A must visit when you are in Los Angeles,If you are in Los Angeles and (obviously) are visiting Venice Beach then take a couple of hours to visit these canals and the gorgeous multi-million dollar homes around it (avg house is around $1.5M). I have traveled many places in the world and this secluded rarely talked about area is just a fantastic small yet beautiful place that reminds me of small tight neighborhoods in Japan and maybe cozy colorful architecture of London or Amsterdam. Its a fun 30 minute walk with family. We went there with our bikes which was a bit difficult to carry up and down the bridges and very tight when people were passing by us so dont do what we did lol. Also there is no way you can ride your bike as you could easily fall in the water although the water is not very deep.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrooklyniteLA
40,"Great short escape, good way to walk off your meal","After a great meal which included homemade corn tortillas at Baja Cantina restaurant in Marina del Rey, we litterally walked out of the restaurant, took a right hand turn, and started walking the Venice Canals.Other people have posted pictures of the homes, and they are even nicer in person. It is a completely different area compared to Venice Beach which is just a few blocks away. Very serene, very nice place to walk off your meal, take a few pictures, and dream about having enough money to buy a vacation home here.If you are planning on visiting Venice Beach, take a few minutes of your day, and do the Venice Canals Walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiko65
40,"Nice homes, secluded.","I'd say this area is one of the best parts of Venice, if not the best. It is a little more private and secluded than the beach homes which see a lot of foot traffic. The Venice canals were modeled after the canals in Venice, Italy. There used to be gondola rides but not any more. There are some very nice homes along these canals, ranging from modern to cottages. The Venice canals is a wonderful place to take a stroll. There are bridges connecting the streets so you can cross to the other side. This is also the cleanest part of Venice Beach. Lots of ducks hanging out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlosvV4994LN
50,"In Spring, take the kids to see the ducklings","I lived on the canals for many years and I've visited several times since. Venice, CA was originally built as somewhat of a replica of Venice, Italy. The remaining canals are an almost hidden place to get away from the hubbub of Los Angeles. In this park-like setting, there are lots of fascinating houses but the ducks rule the canals. You can hear their sporadic quacking everywhere. In the Spring, the ducks and their ducklings calmly float up and down the waters of the canals. It's a nice place for a quiet, relaxing, leisurely stroll. Use Google to find out about the interesting history of Venice, California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryw799
50,An Historic Hidden Gem,"The canals were how Venice, CA got its name but today most are filled in with only a small section remaining that is hidden away but worth finding to see.

50,historical canals hidden behind the crazy Venice boardwalk,"The boardwalk in Venice defines just part of the Bohemian air in Venice California. Another part of the split personality are the lovely historical canals that define the artistic (and expensive!!) neighborhoods above Washington Blvd. The beautiful restored or modernized homes bring such charm and character to this area. The canals have small boats sometimes resting within and you can find ducklings and frogs and other marsh animals hiding in between or under the bridges. Take a slow stroll and take your camera. Respect the neighbors, and make sure to walk the area in and around the canals so that you can get the full flavor and balance of what Venice, California is really like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624

30,A nice walk,I wouldn't go out of your way to go here but if you are in the area it is a nice area to walk through and check out. The water level was very low when we were here but it was fun to walk though and check out the homes along this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crsergeant
40,A hidden gem,"My wife and I had an extra day in LA before taking a midnight flight to Tahitit/Bora Bora and we spent part of it in Venice Beach. Had we not read about the Canals Walkway on this site we would not likely have found or done it. It's only a couple of blocks off the beach but it is not well advertised. Once you find it's starting point on Washington, it's less than overwhelming. My wife and I almost elected to pass it was so unimpressive, but we are glad we started and continued on. It is a very pleasant 30-45 walk through a very interested series of canals, with some very nice homes, landscaping, etc. Well worth the time and a nice change of pace from the beach itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain8180

50,Must see!,Most people who live here don't even go here to see the canals. They are hidden and something so special to walk through or drive over the bridges. I've never seen a more charming site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9276GBandreas
50,A fun place to walk around,Great restaurants near by. Try the Gondola's. The houses and boats are amazing to see for free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
50,Great escape in the city.... excellent walking tour,We come to Santa Monica and the LA area for vacation every year but this was the first time we spent time walking and driving around the Venice Canals.It's quite unique to see something like this in the area and it's beautiful and kids love walking on the bridges. Very serene and fun walking around and seeing the Canal and waterway and the homes.Beautiful birds and ducks around. Great for young kids. Definitely worth spending some time walking around before you hit the beaches which are only a few blocks over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintba
50,a treasure island in a horrible car centred city,"The only place it seems that you can get away from the lonely gas guzzling society destroying cars. Small, intimate interesting and varied and you can walk all around the area. A great vision of the man who first set it up, what an effort it must have been, I am sure he would have had a lot of opposition to create such a dream? This area should be treasured and supported and more areas like them made for the future tourist to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrantRichard

50,nice place for a long walk,It's crazy that a developer cut all these canals in to sell his houses. Couldn't do that today unless in Dubai. Ducks wander freely. Cute little beach houses. I can walk around for hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carry_0n_traveler
50,A tiny taste of Europe a few blocks from the beach,"If you are looking for a quiet stroll near the water and the crowds of Venice Beach are a bit too much, then head a few blocks inland to the Canals of Venice.

50,venice beach,"I got the Grand Los Angeles tour,from ""TAKE TOURS"" in Los Angeles.It was a package 2 nights in Hacienda Airport Hotel,and the next day Los Angeles tour.The tour begins with Marina Del Ray,then to Venice beach.We had a break in Venice Beach,it was really lovely to walk along the sea.Then to Santa Monica,West Hollywood,Hollywood,Beverly Hills,old town,Union station ,then to Star's homes.The tour picks up and dropps off at the hotel.On the first day of the trip pick up from the airport and on the 3 rd. day drop off where you want (for example airport or Union station etc.)It 's really very convinient when you think 2 nights hotel, overnight, and the transfers.Just on the other side of the hotel there is a big supermarket where you can find almost everything after a hard day.I planned 8 nights for the west coast and the first 2 nights in Los Angeles,and the last night in Los Angeles.With the help of ""TAKETOURS"" I could see the important places of Los Angeles. The driver was also very good and kind.Explained eFor the visitors who has short time I would recomend this plan.The driver who also explained everything was perfect.My husband and I want to thank ""take tours,Hacienda Hotel and the drivers""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayhanbalim
40,Cool to see,i think this was in a few movies... It is cool to see but not a lot to see. You can easily see it in a quick 20 - 30 min walk just down from the beach area. I liked it and glad I went to see it! Another FREE attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyetacs
50,Our favorite part of Venice Beach,"This is a hidden jem in Venice beach. We didn't really care for Venice Beach in comparison to Santa Monica beach, it was dirty with lots of homeless people. The actual canals with the walkways and bridges was so beautiful, so much character and charm. I found it hard to believe it was Venice Beach. There were virtually no other tourists here so it must not be that well known, but we very much enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodyH394
50,Definitely worth checking out!,"See how the other half lives -- literally! You get a ground-level view into the eclectic homes of these lucky residents of Venice. If you like architecture, art, and home decor, you'll really enjoy peaking into the yards and homes along the canals. Even if you don't, you'll be impressed by these homes. It doesn't take long to give yourself a little tour, so as long as you are going to Venice Beach, take 20 minutes or so to explore the canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BostonBetsy11

30,"Take a lovely, leisurely walk","The canals were dug out of a swamp almost 100 years ago and little bungalows were built here to stay while visiting the circus and pool in Venice. Most of the little bungalows have been replaced by 2-3 story modern homes. Still the canal walk is quiet and relaxing. The large public pool is long-gone but the circus atmosphere still remains on the Venice boardwalk. There are plenty of little restaurants in which to eat, some of them with hamburgers and hot dogs and some of them are quality restaurants with a nice menu and a good bar. The walk up to the boardwalk in only a short distance. Park in the public parking lot at the end of Washington Street and walk a block down to the canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthCalgirl

40,"Surprising, fun walk!",We headed out hoping to find the elusive canals of Venice beach and just stumbled upon the Walkway.

50,Very Unique destination,"We've toured this area on bike and on Segway and there's always something interesting to see. The canals are a residential area, but all the houses are so interesting and different.

50,hidden beauty in (bit tacky) venice,"accidently stumbled on the canals - some beautiful gardens and houses and canals. A wonderful walk through the maze of the canals. Venice beach can be a lot to take in but the canals offer a welcome break. So pleased we accidently found them. We looked to be the only people walking through them, but I can imagine they, like most things, get a lot busier in summer and lose some of beauty in the buzz of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkcamelno9
50,Wonderful verrry special place.,Even most L.A. folks haven't been here. It is rare and special!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobCurran
40,"Worth checking out, but only if you have time",A beautiful and peaceful part of Venice Beach. Definitely worth a walk through to check it out.

40,The other side of Venice,It is a quiet and beautiful part of Venice...the complete opposite of the crazy and dirty boardwalk.

40,An alternative to Venice Beach,"I found out about the canals of Venice Beach thanks to my friend who insisted we saw them. I had been to Venice several time, and never realized there were there. Indeed there are slightly tucked away inland a street or 2 away from the Beach. But once you see it, you will realize it is worth the detour. You walk around canals and bridges and see wonderful houses with their private gardens everywhere. This is a very refreshing after a car-packed visit to Downtown or Hollywood Bd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranckS67
50,Lovely,"beautiful quiet stroll after the madness that is Venice Beach - all sorts of different house styles - we liked the original old houses the best - it was decorated for xmas when we went and that was lovely to see, all the bridges were lit, can't imagine living there though as it must be like living in a fish bowl!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeanie

50,BEAUTIFUL,"We loved the canals, they are so well kept, so beautiful and a relaxed area to spend some time walking through. The little bridges are cute, you can go by car of course but iit is nicer to walk through the area because the canals and the houses and gardens are very attractive and you would miss a lot if you don't get out of the car. I highly recommend a visit to this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sylvia9933
40,Great walk on a sunny day,"The walkway runs along the famous Venice canals. Lots of beautiful houses (my favorites are the small cottages, which are the original buildings of the area). Quaint bridges. The only thing missing are gondolas! But you should see plenty of kayaks and stand-up paddle boarders while you stroll. Note: The walkway is narrow. It is not suitable for strollers (you'll be in the way of other walkers) and bikes are not allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017

30,A lovely old neighborhood with canals,This is a lovely part of Los Angeles history. The neighborhood is connected by a series of canals and pretty bridges. There is no place to park once you are there so find something on the adjacent streets and walk in. You really need to walk it to appreciate the ambiance. There are lots of neat houses and the walkways and bridges are just charming.

40,Holiday Lights,My mom and I have visited every December to enjoy the elaborately decorated homes near Carroll & Linnie Canals. There are two homes that go all out with their decor & lights.

50,Beautiful place where to walk and relax,"If, like me, you are tired of crowded and noisy Venice beach, do not hesitate. It's only 2 block away from the southern beach walk. There are signs posted to get there. A real paradise with very nice houses and beautiful small gardens. I just feel a bit annoyed for people living there with all day tourists looking in their gardens and houses. As I read a lot of canals were destroyed decades ago and only a few of them were saved from destruction thanks to citizens associations. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrenchFred
50,Very Good (and free),"First impressions of Venice Beach were not great as it all seemed a bit seedy, but we found the canals walkway and that all changed. Tranquil walk with a good path and bridges over several areas of canal right outside the yards of the local residences which are very interesting and varied in design.

50,A Must See,"Everyone goes to the Venice Boardwalk (very fun!) but this is just 2 blocks away and just beautiful.

You will be sorry if you miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuser
40,Amazing set up!,"Went for a walk here early one morning was lucky to find free street parking nearby the start of the walk. Was great to see the canals and cute Bridges. Must be annoying for residents having tourists wander by their homes, path is literally on their doorsteps. But maybe the residents are as laid back as the rest if Venice!We took the signposted path from the canal down to beach then. Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinTash

40,Grab a Great Cup of Coffee and Take a walk thru the Venice Canals,"I love gardens, walking, history and coffee. The Venice Canal Walkways allowed me to indulge in all of these. I never knew about the canals until a few years ago when I read a newspaper article about them-suddenly I understood why the city is named Venice. The canals are not huge and appear to be about 3 feet deep. The day I went to see them, you could see fish and small crabs that must have washed in when they change the water. I far more enjoyed walking thru the canal walkways than on the Venice Beach walk (although everyone should see that too). It is very interesting that the homes are a mixture of small quaint original bungalows mixed with bungalows that have ""grown"" into large 2 story homes. The Venetian theme is also apparent on Venice Beach where several orginal buildings have Venetian type columns and windows. I suggest before you stroll thru the canal walkways that you stop and get a coffee. I did what I usually do and asked a local for a coffee recommendation. She recommended the Cow's End on Washington Blvd. It was obviously a local's place and was packed( however there was a Starbucks 1 block up. ) We grabbed a delicious Americano and had a wonderful morning stroll thru the Venice Canal Walkways",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/labonvoyer
