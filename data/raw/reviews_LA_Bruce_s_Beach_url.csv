40,Serene,"This is a very nice small park overlooking the beach. It is quiet, uncrowded, has lovely benches and lots of green space. I stopped here and just sat...taking in the breeze and the lovely view. It was a lovely and serene place in which to escape.Probably the only drawback is the lack of parking close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillK427

30,Ok Beach but important history,This is a site where black residents were kicked out to make a park. The sand in Hermosa is better and the surf is better in El Porto most days,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarsB_12
30,Relaxing Spot,"This is a nice small park on a steep hill right by the beach. There are benches, a basketball court and seems a lot of people like bringing their dogs here which is cool. Great views of the ocean and a really nice chill spot to relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Beautiful memories were made here when my daughter was an infant.,"Back in the early 70's I would bring my infant daughter to Bruce's Beach and spend an hour or so reading to her. She wasn't one year old yet. We came weekly until she was about four years old. It was named Culligan Park at the time. I eventually learned the history of the park and shared it with her when she was an adult. I visited the park just two weeks ago and whammy....the memories came flooding in. Bruce's Beach is such a peaceful spot. We would lie down on the grass and look up into the sky trying to find ""animals"" in the clouds or people watch. It's so nice to have such wonderful memories with my first child.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quilter7741
30,"Nice little park, close to the beach","Bruces Beach is a very nice little park, close to the beach. But like all grass in MB, dogs will do their business on it. Then people want to lay in it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
50,Nice green space overlooking the beach,Bruce's Beach is a nice grassy area between The Strand and Highland Ave that overlooks the beach and water. There are several benches throughout and an outside workout area near The Strand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimcE8895KX
40,Serenity,We walk here a lot. The views are lovely and it is very relaxing. It's only a couple of blocks to the beach where there are restaurants galore and more great walking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/innfan2013
10,Meh,"Nice grassy area with ocean view, not really that near the beach. Parking not readily available, pass by often. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronsK8337AE
50,Fabulous views in the Heart of Manhattan Sand Section,Watch the sunset... watch the surfers... Enjoy the expanded views from Malibu south... A great place to stop and just enjoy the day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteG287
30,"Nice parkette, a block from the beach.","This is a nice small park, only a block away from the beach. Parking can be difficult. For those looking for a place for a picnic, with a view of the ocean (but without that pesky sand), this is nice, but only about half of the park is flat--the rest slopes down towards the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492BrianC
30,Proof there is grass in Manhattan Beach,Large park by Manhattan Beach standards but actually pretty small. There is a nice view of the ocean from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/93mourn
10,Dog Crap Everywhere,Lots of dog poo everywhere. Also crap from humans playing yoga.This place is not for everyone....if you hate dogs don't go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8269BDjohnd
40,Nice park - it's not a beach,"Located between 26th and 27th Streets, and Highland and Manhattan Aves, this is a grass park with fabulous views of the beach and ocean. Closer to Highland there are a few shade trees and a couple of benches where you can relax and take in the spectacular view of the beach. Below, as you move closer to Manhattan Avenue, there are a couple of basketball hoops, and below those is an open grass area where dogs are welcome as long as they are on leash. If you aren't up for the trek down to the sand/ocean this park is a nice place for a picnic. Below Manhattan Avenue there is metered parking in two small lots, otherwise you have to be lucky to find street parking, which in the summer is always a challenge. It's a nice park, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get to it - it's more of a stopping off point rather than a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAWH77
