50,Worth the Hike to see the MASH site,"This has been on my list for a couple of decades. I visited the real interior MASH sound stage in 1981, and wanted to see the exterior set some day.This past weekend we made a trip to LAX and Malibu just to hike in Malibu Creek state Park to the MASH set site.It was worth the walk.We also saw several deer and a lot of vultures and hawks.The site is well preserved and the historical markers have been replaced since being destroyed by the Malibu fires in the past few years.The signage at the site is terrific.There is a covered picnic table spot were the mess tent once stood.The park has installed a selfie-post with a clamp so you can take a photo of yourself at the famous sign post using your own camera or phone.There area couple of burned out vehicles from the filming days, and a newer acquisition ambulance open for photos.Thank you to Fox studios and the state of California for preserving this place and enhancing it with extra features.",John C
50,"Best LA shortcut to ""Korea""","Our family is big fan of the MASH TV series. Being on California trip, it was must for us to go there. We were lucky to visit the site roughly one week before 2018 fire at the Malibu Creek State Park. Hiked in November and was still quite hot. Snacks, sunscreen, solid shoes and water supplies are must. Can¬¥t imagine the visit in the real summertime. We had no problem finding that place.Anyway, well worth effort, goosebump experience and our personal top three highligt of our three weeks California trip.Last but not least - big thanks to all who take care about this place and enabled us this unforgettable experience.",Thomasero
50,Iconic location! Here are some TIPS on finding your way...,"I'm really glad I did this hike yesterday! Granted, it was 100¬∫ and bright sunshine, making it a very hot hike. But being from Arizona, I knew to prepare well by covering almost all exposed skin, using a broad hat, slathering on sunscreen--twice, pausing a few times in the shade, eating snacks, and taking WAY more water than I thought I would need. Sure enough, I ran into a whole family that looked overheated and was able to refill one of their bottles while still having enough for my return trip.For about the first half or more of the hike, you're on a wide dirt road that's obvious to follow. Lots of people went in as far as the rock pools and Century Lake for day use fun. Then it gets a lot less crowded.Other write-ups have said it was an entirely flat hike. Not true. There's one section on the way out that steadily climbs for about 1/8 or 1/4 mile, but it's not bad. Nothing too steep. And it makes coming back faster. Overall, it is an easy hike compared to most day hikes I've taken...except for the brutal heat if you go on a day like I did.Now, about that creek crossing. Eventually, as you hike along the right bank of Malibu Creek, you come across a big cement platform on your left sticking into the creek that looks like the foundation for an old bridge. Don't use it. It dead ends. Instead, stay on the righthand bank for about 100 more yards, as the trail becomes a single track hiking trail. Soon you'll see two large trees spanning the creek. Everyone I saw had no trouble balancing their way across, but granted, the river was low in late July. There might be other places to cross, too. As soon as you cross the logs, don't turn right instantly. Go straight forward about 25-50 steps further on a trail through the brush until you find an obvious trail junction. Turn right at this T-shaped intersection. From here, it's easy to follow the trail to the MASH site, about 1/4 mile further as it curves around to the left.At the site, I made sure to look around, not just on the main grounds but also up on the helicopter pad and down to the creekbed where the ""minefield"" was filmed. I also went beyond the MASH site just a bit and saw that it becomes a wider road again, I walked on this section to picture all those scenes that took place outside of camp, like when vehicles would drive in to camp, as in the much-awaited arrival of Marilyn Monroe, or when people would drive off, like Henry Bake's departure or Trapper and Hawkeye heading out to interact with locals.The return hike is easy to retrace and faster to hike. If not in a rush, you can dip in the water to cool off at various spots, including right at the MASH site before you turn back.I hope this helps. Have a great time!P.S. As others have mentioned, I was lucky enough to have a helicopter fly by right when I was at the MASH site, making me feel like I was in the opening sequence. My guess is there are tourist flights over the canyons, but inside my head I could hear the speakers saying ""Incoming wounded. All personnel report to the O.R.""",Doug T.

40,Don't do it in the heat.,"I set off on this hike last week and was told at the entrance to the parking that it was straight forward, so we didn't bother with a map. There were signs saying the MASH site was closed due to heavy rain but people said you could still get there. My friend and I followed a group of people past the visitors center and on to a swimming point where we realized we'd gone the wrong way. At this point my friend turned back because of the heat but I continued on up over the mountain and past the swimming area that everyone else seemed to be heading to. Signs for the MASH site had stopped and there was just one saying Forest Trail. It was hot and I was alone and I thought I was going the wrong way so eventually I turned back. Never got to the MASH site but did a lot more mileage than the distance stated on the signs. I was disappointed because I'd come all the way from Australia. I realize I should have bought a map, for piece of mind at least! Maybe I'd have got there if I'd kept going!",Andrew

40,Hike to MASH site.,"Very beautiful park, still recovering from fires. Most trees are charred and it smells like a campfire, but did not distract from the beauty of the landscape. Mountains very majestic.Hint: I hiked this trail on 2/28/19 with the aid of a map I got from the administration office for $2.00.It is very rugged the last 3/4 mile....tennis shoes are not a good idea, especially if wet and muddy.Important: the map shows a bridge at the west end of Century Lake that you cross the creek to go to MASH site....it looks like it‚Äôs partiality gone. I couldn‚Äôt find a full bridge anywhere, but from past reviews and pics there had to be a place to cross the creek, if it‚Äôs there, I never saw it. I crossed the creek by walking over a downed tree....not recommended, but I‚Äôd come too far to turn back.Very enjoyable and nostalgic hike.So glad I did it!!üëçüëç",Christopher C

Having said that, it is a wonderful, beautiful long walk with beautiful vistas and history. Along the way, there is also an old hunting lodge on the way that is now a museum that is a lot of fun to stop by on the way to the MASH set. There are also outhouses by the museum on the way to the set. No facilities at the set but there are picnic tables. You can pay for parking inside Malibu Creek State Park and it is a bit of a shorter walk or find parking along the roads that surround the park for free but the walk is longer.

You can park on Mulholland and walk into the park (rather than paying fee to park in lot) and will get a bit more of a workout doing so.On high-temperature days, I recommend starting out before 10:00 a.m. so that you can walk to the perimeter fence and back by noon.

50,Hidden Gem,"I visited the MASH Site in October 2017. My husband is a big fan of the show, so he had to see this once he heard about it, and I'm glad he did. As I'm not as big a fan of the show as he is, this place was really neat. It's a long hike to the area, but not difficult. It's only accessible by foot. The surroundings are very dry, from the California drought, but it's pretty, especially the mountains. When you get to the actual site, there are two jeeps, a picnic area, and the iconic MASH sign with Seoul, Burbank, San Francisco etc. You can also walk up the hill to the get a view of the helipad. Great for pictures. You can get into the jeeps for photos as well. There is a self picture stand to set a timer on your phone to take a picture by the sign. There are signs with cast photos,and info about what was filmed in the location. We went on a Tuesday afternoon in October, and we were the only ones there. A few Rangers drove through, but that was it. Even though it was October, it was very warm. 85 degrees with zero shade. It's a very cool place to see.",Rainbow

40,A visit to MASH.,"With our 2017 visit to the USA, spending time in LA, we had to visit the MASH site. Not well advertised and it takes a bit of research to find it too. Need to zoom in on google!It starts with a fee to park near the track in. The walk in is long, as previous reviewers have mentioned and in parts it is quite a rough track with minimal signposting and a fair bit of flood damage. The walk in is also quite scenic in its rugged beauty and worth the trek for this scenery itself. Most of us MASH fans are getting on a bit and some could struggle with the trek itself, would be tough on a hot summers day I think. The area around the filming site is getting quite overgrown which detracts from the overall experience a little but fortunately the sign detailing the camp layout is still legible and informative. Was it worth the effort? Absolutely! If you like the series or its on your bucket list, grit your teeth and do the walk, it was a special feeling to stand on the site of so many memories. California State Parks could do more to maintain the site I think.",Steve A

Some hills, some rocky areas, but very doable. There are plenty of picnic tables to rest and have lunch or a snack. The earlier you go the better for both the heat and crowds (on weekends). There are plenty of hikers, joggers, mountain bikers so share the road. Use the restrooms at the parking lot before the hike.",PhotoJane

50,A Bucket List for Me,"Being a MASH fan (freak), I had to do this trip. I had researched and utubed as much information as I could. The walk to the site (2.4mile) was easy enough, but we are active people. I was surprised at the number of people I saw on the walk as I didn't expect many there. When we arrived at the site, I took my time and captured the years of TV history that I grew up with. The area is somewhat overgrown, and using the Utube videos prior to going helps. It would be good if some more work could be done out there but as it isn't a money making tourist attraction, and a State Park, that isn't likely. I loved it and my wife had a great time too.

50,Need coordinates?,"I cycled here from LA and Google Maps managed to avoid every map and signpost on the way into the park before dumping me in what I presume is it's geographical centre.After getting wrong directions from a couple of folks and adding a couple of miles and an extra hill to the ride I was finally directed to a signpost telling me I was a mile-and-a-half away. After that it was easy going with markers at each junction.The final section of the trail was pretty brutal on my 16"" wheels (I was riding a Brompton) as it's extremely rocky but if you're hiking I'd consider this an extremely easy walk.There's little to no phone service at the site, so brush up on a couple of YouTube clips before you go to get the most from your visit.

40,"Stunning canyon views and a fun throwback, even if you haven't seen the show","There are a few ways you can get to the MASH site, and I highly recommend taking the Cistern Trail route which starts on Mulholland, which boasts impressive views as you descend into the canyon and sync up with the flatter Lookout trail below. The flatter route is less scenic, longer, and you have to pay for parking. Once you reach the MASH site itself, there are photos posted around the area to give you an idea of what was filmed there, and I was even inspired to watch a few episodes to see the scenery. Very doable (the way back up Cistern can be a little steep), definitely an easy-moderate hike. Takes about 45-60 minutes each way depending on pace, with a break to check out the site in the middle.",Kallan P

It's not too difficult with regard to grade, but the terrain is trick to navigate coming from the main Malibu park entrance. There's a riverbed filled with rocks that must be traversed and plenty of roots popping up along the path. It's a beautiful spot even for those who never watched an episode, but it's a treasure for those that did. The helicopter hill is still in tact and there's a few remaining set pieces left behind for fans. Pack water and go.",Marc R
50,"Fun, easy hike, especially if you enter by Malibu Lake","Our family has hiked this trail several times over the last few years. It's a great way to introduce tourists to the beauty of the Santa Monica Mountains and reward them with a bit of Hollywood nostalgia. 20th Century Fox left props from the MASH TV show on site and the Park Service has done an excellent job of maintaining the pieces while adding some fun stills from the show so you can get an idea of how the scenery played such an important part of the set. Most people start the hike from the entrance off Mulholland Highway. I think the hike is about 3 miles round trip. Bring water and sunscreen, possibly bug spray too as it is really hot sometimes in the summer and the bugs congregate in the still swampy stream that is sometimes there. HINT -- the hike is really flat, shorter and not-so-rocky if you enter from Crags Road over by Lake Malibu. That entrance is at the end of Crags Road. Legal parking is hard to come by over there -- you may have to walk some of the non-sidewalked streets of the Lake Malibu neighborhood (a real trip all by itself!). All this can be accomplished in 2 hours. Highly recommended.",Ohiofamily

40,"Love the show, happy I saw this!","I have seen every MASH episode probably 20 times. I didn't realize this place existed until I came upon it by chance on google maps. I knew I had to see it. The hike is probably considered easy but if you work at a desk and lack cardio health like we do, hiking this in 85 degrees will be a little bit of a challenge. But only in the way of sweating more than you thought you would. Bring plenty of water, it gets hot! It took us longer to hike there than to hike back (2.4 mi ea). Going there, you have to go uphill a bit and we stopped frequently.There is not a ton of information at the site. It looks like the weather beats on the few information posts they do have. But if you are a loyal viewer, you'll get it. You can go up to the helipad area for a view of the entire site. As soon as you see the surrounding mountains, you hear the theme in your head.

50,M*A*S*H Camp Via Shortcut Craggs Rd Trail,"This was a dream come true trek I had been wanting to take for quite some time. Having re-located from the mid-west due to a tornado, and residing in hotels for the better part of a year, I had become a bit more sedentary & out of shape than I ever wanted to be; hence I did a great deal of research on the shortest, less strenuous route into the famed television set. This yielded my result I share with you now: Feel welcome, for a small fee as other reviewers have indicated, to enter the wilds of the Mountains above Malibu and all of it's wonders therein, via The Malibu Creek State Park whose tele & internet info I have included, as the park rangers say there is one area where it's only about 4 miles or so round trip to the M*A*S*H Camp/site/set, or take the back way on the other end of the mountain, to a little known, and initially un-marked, (relatively no clue you're on the correct road to the remnants of the M*A*S*H Camp until almost there,) trail head beginning at the end of a street called ""Craggs Rd.,"" which is located in a lovely mountainous lake community, and which brings the journey down to only around 3 miles round trip. The body of water, for g.p.s. purposes, is called Malibou Lake. It is quite a gorgeous dock in and of itself when the sun hits the tranquil pond at just the right angle during the afternoon ""golden hours."" That being said, since this area is someone's neighborhood and houses places of residences, one must be respectful of the posted parking restrictions, making sure not to block anyone's drive when parking off the street, (there are ample spots nearer to & on ""Lookout Street"") & gearing up to hike this fun, and much more accessible trail. In fact speaking of the word accessible, as it refers to someone with special needs, I would advise further research (employing some sort of on line map with satellite capabilities,) of one's own before attempting to make the drive up either end of the hill getting to the trail head near Malibou Lake. Even though this trail has the feeling of a fire road, being relatively level, as well as roomy enough for 2-4 people (on my brief journey i spied several hikers, as well as a local school's track club running together,) to join in on the exciting conversation while heading to the prized film site, there is only a small opening at the fence by this trail head I describe, and I am not sure if said space is wide enough to accommodate a wheel chair. If wanting to attempt allowing a handicapped person bound to a wheel chair to also share in this fun fan experience, I would suggest directing queries either with the State Park or the exclusive Malibou Lake Mountain Club on the street adjacent to Craggs Rd, called Lake Vista Street, there in the Agoura Hills, known for their creative wedding packages. Maybe someone could open that gate for your party just for the duration of the quick trip. One last note concerning person's with dissabilities, that is probably the only way a pet would be allowed entrance to the restricted land, ofcourse if it is one legally registered to assist. In which case, as with any other area posting a no pet sign, bring necessary documentation if required to be safe. Once on the trail, barring the occasional chug or pot hole, it again is a very user friendly road. If before-hand you do indeed spy a satellite map, such as Google Earth or what have you, it's easy to see it's a pretty straightforward path from the end of the neighborhood to the prized destination. Getting closer there is a sign showing you're on the right track, or just ask any of the many pedestrians taking in the lovely scenery. Which leads me to believe that embarking midday in the middle of the week was the best plan, since I know I avoided the crowds, and most-likely my vehicle was less in the way of the residents. Also imperative not to embark into any unknown territory too close to nightfall, as the cell coverage didn't last too far away from the civilization that is the adjacent neighborhood. I found this out when trying to call family members I wish were there, who, along with me, had grown watching the cast of this beloved iconic television series. Anyway, back to our walk... When almost on top of the filming site, a.k.a. ""The 4077th,"" the clues all fall into place as one can easily spy the recognizable Goat's Butte seen in the opening credits of the show. Once there, kick back and revel in your accomplishment. There is a porta-potty, photo ops, and a shaded picnic area complete with tables, and covered with a military-esque camo material befitting the theme. There was a fire the last season of M*A*S*H's filming, so the structures no longer are present, but there's plenty of picture evidence denoting where landmarks once stood as well as a few objet d'arte such as an Ambulance, Jeeps, and what appears to be a replica of the signature Signpost from the television show's prop department. If daring, and wearing some good hikers, as it gets slippery when dry, traverse on up the hill just behind the lunch tables to the famed helipad. The rocks on this detour provide a little traction and protection from erosion, but I would still caution that you travel with care. Everything may seem smaller than we perceive on our t.v. sets at home, but this historical site is still a large check off on most people's bucket lists. When all is said and done, I hope you have as much fun as I did.",TiffMateas
