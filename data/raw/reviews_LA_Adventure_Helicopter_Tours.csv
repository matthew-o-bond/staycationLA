50,The way to get a greater LA area overview.,"I had a great time on a Sunday afternoon with Great Adventure, flying out of Whiting Field. After hitting both Burbank and Van Nuys for a heli flight (with ""no joy"") I lucked on to these guys. They got a pilot out on short notice to meet me at 3 PM at Whiting. I did a spectacular solo trip with the pilot for $300. Flight route was through a pass in Encino, out over Santa Monica, the beach and pier, then back towards the Capital Records building, the Hollywood sign, Aaron Spelling's mansion, and back through the pass to Whiting. I can't recommend them enough. It was the highlight of my touristy trip to LA (from South Carolina) Do it, and I promise you wouldn't regret it--as long as you're not afraid of heights!",SC Osprey
10,WORST COMPANY EVER,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I paid for a ""Romantic Sunset Tour"" valued at $438.00 and was taken to the Hollywood Sign, a $198.00 value. They refused to honor the tour I purchased once I was up in the air. BAIT & Switch!!! Read up on this company, which I didn't do beforehand. TONS of awful reviews and poor ratings. Please do not use!!!! They will scam you!",greenies04
50,Happy Birthday,"I brought my husband for a surprise birthday gift. It was AWESOME!! Our pilot Chad was great! We had a wonderful tour, saw lots of landmarks and celebrity homes. We could even see the beach from the LA/Hollywood tour. I only wish it was longer...can't wait to go back.",LJRAND
50,Amazing Experience!!!!!,"All I have to say it that it was really an adventure, I took my wife and 2 boys and they enjoyed it so much. My wife loved it so much we bought gift certificates for our family. I recommend this place to anyone who wants an adventure. Our pilot was Chad he was a very knowledgeable and made all of us feel really comfortable and we had a smooth flight. It was an AMAZING experience. Talk to Avis the owner e will hook you up. A+++++++++++++++ EXPERIENCE.",george S
50,Tour of the city,"My husband and I had a great time with this tour. Our pilot was friendly and knowledgeable, and the company was avery professional. I recommend this tour to all my friends, and will definitely do the one in vegas as well! A+ company!",vickabelian
50,Breathtaking experience,This helicopter tour was an amazing experience. I recommend it to all travelers. We toured all the popular sites and it was all breathtaking! It's a must do adventure.,MaryAyva11
20,Look for another Helicopter company,"My wife and kids pitched in to by me a helicopter ride for Christmas in 2010. I did not get around to using the voucher until August of 2011. In that 8 months in-between I called 2 times just to make sure I was still good to go and they assured me the vouchers or certificates never expire. In July I made a reservation for August. My wife had bought two tickets so I could take a friend as well, and they had a given my wife a guarantee that I would get to ride in the front seat as well.We showed up in plenty of time, and it does take a little while to find the proper hangar. Once we got there we needed to sign waivers. My friend would not sign the waiver, he thought the waiver (and it was) was more for Bungee jumping than for a helicpoter ride,and he should know he is a pilot himself. Even if they crash the helicopter, you are signing away your family's right to legal recourse.Finally we get going over to the helicopter, sort of a long golf cart ride away. Another lady came with us and she was a pilot in training. When we got in the helicopter she got in the front seat and they told me it was for weight reasons. So I'm stuffed in the back, I've paid for two people and I'm trying to put on my game face and enjoy it all. We did the tour, which was cool, got to go over my house, took some great pictures and then we started heading back, the tour was less than 30 minutes. Somewhere this pilot had eaten up time and he needed to get back for the next tour, I questioned him while we were on the flight and he said he didn't want to run out of gas. I didn't say anything but i'm like really, you were prepared for 4 people, we only have 3 and you're worried about gas.So when we got back I asked him what to do about the extra person that my wife had paid for. The pilot said if I came again with another person they would give me 1 $50 off voucher, I'm like that's it? So I left.That evening the pilot called me asking me for a copy of my reciept, he said he had lost his, so I sent him a copy. I thought that was the end of it and then in March of 2012 I got a call from the new owner asking for a copy of my reciept as well and telling me I shouldn't have been allowed on that flight because my original/voucher had expired. I literally thought he was going to try and charge me again for the flight. He said I could call him in a week or two and work out the other flight I was owed.All this left such a bad taste in my mouth, my wife and kids had tried to do something special for me and it jsut turned out to be a costly debaucle. I'm not sure if there are other helicopter adventure tours in Los Angeles but I would strongly recommend going with one of them. I'm not going back and am jsut going to wipe my hands clean of this.",zuza11
50,Thank You,These guys should get five stars just for the level of service they provide. About a month ago the pilot there Ryan helped me surprise my gf and propose to her on the helicopter ride. I came to see him a few weeks before he showed me around and helped me plan the perfect day. When we arrived he was super professional and acted like everything was okay in order not to give anything away. Then up in the air I pulled out the ring an proposed. It was the best day of my life thanks to these guys.The tour itself is worth every single penny. Being up in that helicopter is an undescribable feeling. All i can say is that I am super happy and thank you adventure helicopter for being so accomodating and professional.,artur m
40,Father's Day Surprise - Helicopter ride over L.A.,"My husband has been wanting to go for the longest time so my son and I surprised him with a helicopter ride with Adventure Helicopter tours for Father's Day. I contacted another helicopter tour company but the service and response time were lackluster. After the 3rd failed phone call, I called Advenutre and was immediately pleased with Vaughn's customer service. He was willing to work with the specific flight time I had in mind (around sun set). The day before the tour, I was contacted by Ryan who notified me that due to the L.A. Dodger's game, we could not do Tour #2. I did not want to do the beaches tour nor upgrade to the next price tier. However, both Vaugn and Ryan were able to work out a customized tour (minus the Dodgers Stadiium). We were able to see everything my husband wanted to see including a fly over our house (luckily, on a helicopter, we lived only moments away from Whiteman Airport). Ryan, the pilot, was awesome! He was able to answer all my 9-year old's questions while pointing the highlights in Hidden Hills (you'd have to take the tour to find out!!!!!). We were a stone's throw away from the Hollywood sign and witnessed something we've never seen before....the 405 freeway with NO TRAFFIC!. And best of all, we saw the sun set while hovering over Hollywood. It was a beautiful and memorable moment. The flight is definitely something you'd have to experience. I had to down some dramamine before the flight as I get motion sickness but I'm sure I would have been totally fine without them. The flight was smooth from take off to landing. Be mindful of other fees and taxes not listed with the tour price and if you're taking Tour #2, make sure there are no Dodger's game at day of your tour. For our first helicopter ride, we loved it and would totally do it again....maybe the night tour.",jasmine m
