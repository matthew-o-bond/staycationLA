40,Something for everybody,"This is a section of Pasadena that runs along Colorado Blvd from Pasadena Ave to Arroyo Parkway and 1 block south plus 2-3 blocks north. So as you can see it’s a large shopping, dinning and entertainment area. You will find lost of restaurants and some trending bars with music. An Apple store, Crate and Barrel and Pottery Barn, even a Container store. Lots of little stores too, kind of like an open air mall. Parking can be found a multiple public parking lots located mostly 1 or 2 blocks north or south of Colorado Blvd. along Green St to the south or Union St to the north.

People watching is great as well as strolling the area which appears to be safe with police presence and few homeless. The Rose Bowl is within approx 3 miles and located in a upscale neighborhood which is interesting to drive by and view the older homes having individual character.

Still, the train ride was a pleasant insight into suburban LA.",Reuben M

There's also an alley now labeled ""Big Bang Theory Way"" that's good for a photo if you're a fan of the long-lived show.

Highlights of the visit to Old Town were brunch at Green Street Tavern (brunch was good, and desserts even better), drinks and live music at Kings Row Gastropub (good beer, mule drinks, sangria and live music enjoyed from their patio out back) and finally dinner at Mi Piace (linguine pesto and chocolate soup dessert were highlights). So many places to visit, we wish we had more time!",David W

40,Old??,"I'm not sure why they call it old. Is there a new? Pasadena, as my experience tells me, is ALL old!Maybe it doesn't count as a visit because my family comes from Pasadena and I was fortunate to live here for five years myself. Other than the heat in the summer, it is a delightful place with quaint shops, nightlife and some rather good restaurants. Filled with history, this part of Los Angeles is a treasure to be sure.",Old Pro
10,Over Crowded and Expensive,"I have lived in the Pasadena area for over 20 years and have watched as Old Town has evolved from a quaint area to a tourist/trendy area. Any place that has an Apple Store is going to be over-priced and high density shopping. I do not enjoy going there any more. There used to be locally owned stores and restaurant, but now they are all chain stores catering to the affluent. Parking and traffic are a nightmare on just about every day of th.e week",Robert J

They have a shuttle to Old Town or it is a very short Uber ride. Tons of great restaurants and shopping.Great places to eat.Union, this restaurant is small and very popular. Definitely make a reservation or if you are like me, eat at the bar. As soon as they opened it was difficult to get a table, then Los Angeles Magazine called it one of the ten best places to eat in LA. Soon after that one of the food network channels did a segment on them and now it is even harder to get in. unionpasadena.comSushi Roku, hands down the best sushi here with a great ambiance, that matters to me. Good food in a pit is not my idea of a good experience. innovativedining.com/restaurants/sushirokuThe Kitchen, casual Italian food that is a good value and family oriented.

50,Old Pasadena always has something New,"Old Pasadena is fun and eclectic. It is comprised of several square blocks of mostly old buildings with really interesting architectural details still intact. It's amazing that this area somehow escaped the wrecking ball in its worst run-down years (60s and 70s) to now be a popular place to eat, shop, catch a movie, visit a spa, appreciate kandmark historic structures, buy a high-end car, see public art and performances, watch the Rose Parade, go to a museum, visit sidewalk cafes ... all kinds of stuff!Parking laws are strictly enforced, and you WILL get a ticket if your time runs out while parked on the street. Better to park in one of the many garages that encircle the area. Another issue is the large number of homeless in the area, and they do sometimes block the sidewalks, rant and rave at internal demons and panhandle aggressively. It can be uncomfortable to try to ignore a person in need so you can shop at Tiffany or enjoy a $15 cocktail.Be sure to look down the alleys and side streets for interesting restaurants and shops. Some businesses stay for years and years, while others come and go. The latest trend is toward more stores that offer home furnishings and decor.If you are looking for vibrancy and variety, Old Pasadena is a great destination.",James C
50,Not really old,"There are some buildings clearly marked as constructed more than a hundred years ago but the ""old"" area does not look or feel old. It is a great place to shop and dine. There are some old style specialty shops. Not too many cities have a hat shop or a vintage eyeglasses shop. Many blocks are lined with lit trees. The streets off Colorado should not be ignored. Old Pasadena is much larger than just what you see on Colorado and very safe with foot and vehicle patrol.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"

This visit, we had more time in the early evenings, and saw lots of charm here. Our Hotel (Marriott Courtyard) was very centrally located, and around the entire Hotel area, there were lots of narrow streets and alleys, small plazas, fountains, and lots of old brick buildings, which now house restaurants, outdoor cafes, and small interesting shops. Everything is nicely maintained and well lit at night.The restaurants all looked so appealing, but we just did not have the time to visit most of them.

Local residents intervened, the Chamber of Commerce thought they were crazy but the result is now a highlight of Pasadena and is copied nationwide and worldwide. Lots of shops on the main street (Colorado, where the Rose Parade goes on New Year's) but mostly national chains. If you go one or two streets north or south, plus poke around some of the alleys, you will find some great, non-chain restaurants, smaller shops, jazz clubs, etc.",TravelWarrior200

40,Colorado Street (Suicide) Bridge,"This is a review for the underside of the Colorado Street Bridge. Also known as Suicide Bridge, it has a long and sad history. It is also a beautiful bridge that's with delicate art deco details from that period. We couldn't find any of the Arroyo Seco trailheads (we didn't look very hard) so we parked on a (gorgeous) residential street and kinda slid down a hill to the trail we could see below us and proceeded to walk to the bridge to get some pictures.There are several fenced off, no-tresspassing areas near the bridge but if you really want to break the DNR law, you can get in. There were some DNR folks around doing upkeep.The trail is great and very well groomed. We saw a lot of people for a weekday afternoon. If you're here for pictures, there aren't any great clearings from the trail which are even further obstructed because there's been enough rain to get the trees all full of leaves and flowers.",seaLoves

50,Too much to see & do with one trip,"When you visit Old Town Pasadena you will find that there are many things to see and do. Of course that includes entertainment, shopping, and dining ... There is something for everyone shoes to cars and hotdogs to fine cuisine. This reflects some of the best in the area. But most significant is the history and architecture.Look up! The buildings are beautiful. I can't imagine a ""Forever 21"" sign that is more iconic and significant than the one on the tower in Old Town. It's amazing to me that these buildings have survived when so many downtown areas have raised there old stores and erected a bunch of buildings that are all alike. Some one was paying attention to these gems and saved them.As in most parts of the LA area, parking can be a problem. There are limited metered spaces on the street and several garages. Several of the garages have a special deal that allows you to park free of charge for 90 minutes with a maximum fee for the day. The best deal around. There is also valet parking (especially at night) and validated parking for some establishments.Be careful, Pasadena is serious about their parking laws.

The “Old Town” part of my city is wonderful to walk through — lots of great shopping and places to eat, including the fabulous 21 Choices (best frozen yogurt in the country, as far as I’m concerned!). It’s not a large area, but definitely nice for an afternoon. One tip — don’t just stay on Colorado! Go a block south onto Green or a block North onto Union, and you’ll find many more hidden gems.",Kristin T
50,Once wasn't enough !,No matter what your looking forOld Pasadena has it !About 6 square blocks of a revived down town area complete with National chains & local places to eat and shop - can't miss regardless of who you are or what your interested in - all day or just a few hours,Arloredrock

40,Old Towne Pasadena is a great place to visit,"I visited Old Towne Pasadena several times within the last 5 years and I really enjoyed the closeness of the restaurants, markets, theaters and transportation. Everything is within walking distance from the condo and the Goldline is so convenient to use if you want to go south to downtown L.A., Union Station, Little Tokyo, East L.A., etc. Going toward the north end, the Goldline takes you to Arcadia, Monrovia, Duarte, Azusa, etc. As a big plus, almost all of the restaurants have Happy Hour, which is great for a drink and snack in the late afternoon or after work. Some of the better restaurants in the general area include Houstons, Parkway Grill, Ruth Chris, Yardhouse and La Grange Orange. Markets nearby include Whole Foods and Trader Joes. Nightime entertainment includes theatres, clubs, dining and just people watching. All in all, Old Towne a fun place to visit with all the amenities nearby, without the use of a car.",Sammy T
20,Mall along a Street,I was here in the 90s - it was charming then. Not so now. Lined with mall type stores and a few pretentious eateries. You can find a few nice restaurants on the side streets. We went during the day - maybe it is different at night but the establishments showed no promise for middleagers.,Fsteele
40,Don't miss Old Pasadena at night,This is a great little place to walk around. It has lots of commercial shops but also many local favorites as well. Plenty of restaurants with Happy Hour specials. Make sure you stay until dark. The trees are lit at night and it feels a little like the River Walk in San Antonio.,dmgart

But it does have lovely civic buildings and ""Old"" Pasadena is definitely worth a very delightful stroll. When you add in gorgeous fin de siecle houses like the Gamble and the magnificent Simon and Huntington museums and gardens, you've got the single best small city for the lover of manmade art masterpieces in the country.",FWhiteIII

40,Not as nice as some Old towns by any means but nice for what it is,"I suggest you do not go in expecting some historic landmark area this is immaculate kept up and touristy. This is not what this is, this is a downtown area with shopping still maintained but not by any means cleaned up and touristy. There is good shopping here but judging by all the iron gates, chains and locks i'd say the are still needs some more revitalization. Hopefully it happens, for now the shopping mall area is best",northernk

30,Resurrection by Retail,"Retail outlets have undoubtedly saved the old sector Pasadena but the impression this area gives is a sad one to me. There is little that one would not find in a mall, though there are some interesting local spots. It seemed to me an area in search of an identity, like so many older urban centers in the States. That said, I am glad it is there trying its best to hold on to some historical identity.",Robert C
30,OK time wandering around,"We went with no real idea of what to expect, so we were not disappointed although I don't think that it was really that exciting. Sure, we found some nice shops (I'm thinking ""sugarfina"" in particular, but as others have noted there were lots of big chain stores. Some of the restaurants looked nice.The architecture was OK but seemed a bit mixed (older and newer).I'd really have liked to give a 3.5 rating, as 4 seems a bit generous.",Andrew R

Colorado Blvd is a major street in the area.The area has cafes, restaurants, stores and museums.Although we live in the San Francisco Bay area now, we return frequently. Our recent stay was to go to the Cal-UCLA game at the Rose Bowl. There is a shuttle bus that leaves from the area to go to the Rose Bowl. We stayed a few minutes walk away at the Marriott Courtyard from the shuttle lot.We have celebrated New Years eve in the past in Old Town. We have also walked through the area on our way to our grand stand seats to see the Rose Parade. We have also visited the area and walked Colorado Blvd area on New Years Eve when people are partying and getting ready for a night of fun prior to the Rose Parade.There are also events in the area as well as a Farmers Market.",mini
30,Overrated,"Yes, there is some great architecture, but the European kind of approach one of the reviewers mentioned is completely lacking. The area is dominated by chain stores...nice ones at that so not a big deal, but definitely not the boutique type situation I was expecting. The entire area food wise is overpriced for what you get....and it is very, very small. I didn't get a sense of community, rather a sense of a neighborhood that has lost its original flavor and is adapting to the changing times or what they perceive those to be. Many stores had security guards and many homes had ""armed protection"" on signs posted outside of them. It is pleasant enough though, and basically clean. East of the Old Pasadena on Colorado, many shop fronts are empty ... simply closed. Again, not unpleasant, just not the place I expected based on the hype it has received in other reviews.",Ann S
40,Rosebowl Transport,"Free shuttle!!!!!!!! When you go to a game or event at the Rosebowl - take the shuttle. You pick it up at the Parsons parking lot and are transported directly to the Main Entrance. After the UCLA Cal football game, we walked along the line of those waiting for the shuttle and thought we would never get to the head of the extremely long line. However - the shuttles are incredibly efficient, and the line just kept moving along at a surprising rate. Home pretty quick - and it was free!!!!!!!!!",Lori M

40,Nice place to visit,"Old Pasadena is really nice and quaint, with old Craftsmen homes and some Victorian mixed in, it's a departure from Los Angeles proper. The city hall is great to walk around through as well with the bronze sculpture of Jackie Robinson who grew up there. You don't see any rift raft that you get in downtown Los Angeles and the restaurant selection is vast. Hotels are more affordable there and it's easy to get to where you want to go, we went to the Getty museum from there with no traffic problems at all. And it's fantastic to go and look at the Rose bowl parade floats. I would stay in Old Pasadena but definitely pay for parking in a garage because they are militant about parking tickets there like downtown LA.",worldglobaltravell

I am European and Old Pasadena has a bit of a cosy European feeling. It gives a feeling of a real European style downtown, where people walk on the pathways and enjoy the shops, bars, restaurants etc. There are even nice pedestrian areas with nice terraces etc. And the best news: The area is not dominated by the famous US fast food chains. As far as I know this is the only area in larger LA where this atmosphere is found !",flyingdutchmannl

Old Pasadena has lots of restaurants and shops. Some of them are in pedestrian areas which makes for a quiet refuge away from traffic. Lots of upscale shops and several museums (which are on the edges of Old Pasadena). If you are coming for business bring your spouse or significant other - they will have plenty to do and you will have lots of restaurants to choose from in Old Pasadena.,Stephen G
20,"Expensive, loud and lots of homeless issues","After this latest experience, I won't likely return. Ever. But it is so crowded that they won't likely miss me. There is a chronic homeless problem here and in two restaurants they were there asking for access to bathroom facilities and being turned away - it is a bad situation for everyone - the restaurant, the patron and, most of all, the homeless person. A lose-lose-lose. And to top it off, I used one of the 90-minute-free parking structures that cost $5.00. When I handed in my ticket I was told that there is fine print that there is a flat rate for parking at night. But the 90-minute-free signs are plastered everywhere (even in neon lights). Classic bait-and-switch that gives California such a bad reputation. They were actually laughing at me when asked about the discrepancy. They must be very used to it (and are obviously misleading the public on purpose). Meanwhile, cities like Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara (both much more prestigious than Pasadena) provide genuine free parking in their city structures. I won't return to Pasadena if I can help it.",sfdann

50,Lovely gentle city kicks up her heels.,"We almost forgot the possibility of a different New year's eve celebration, aside from Sydney, Oz's extraordinary bash with glitsy countdown and striking fireworks. Pasadena nails it perfectly with streets literally coming up roses.The Roses parade is a theme-driven extravaganza of elaborate floats covered in a riot of roses and other floral bounties. Included in this mix are a lengthy roster of high stepping equestrians, well-tuned marching bands, a rose queen and her court preceded by a celebrity grand marshal.We were two of one million visitors here to see the spectacle while 40 million watch it on TV. Our package included a seat in the grandstand which we were thankful for.Pasadena is laid back, low- key and compact at home with a hankering for hockey as well as hip art. We loved the Norton Simon Museum which exudes exclusive private art collections, where we spent half a day at this extraordinary epicentre of exceptional art..Later we toured Gamble House, a perfectly preserved American Craftsmen- style bungalow displaying master craftsmanship of the colonial era. Next day we spent in San Marino exploring the Huntington's expansive library, art collection and botanical gardens where there is a charming tea room. We stayed at the Westin Pasadena a block from the Rose Parade route.",Eli B

40,Pleasant Walk,After walking through various parts of LA it was a breath of fresh air to walk around Old Town Pasadena and see the clean streets and nicely kept lots. I noted with interest that some of the tree roots had raised the sidewalk concrete slabs (see photo) and that they had adapted the sidewalk rather than cutting the tree roots - nice touch.,Albywon

50,A walkers Paradise,"If you are looking for ANY kind of restaurant, this is the place to be. I have never seen an area that has so many restaurants per block. They range from cafe's to high end restaurants, from bistro's to ethnic restaurants. I haven't really counted, but it seems like every other shop is a restaurant or eating establishment. There are also a wide variety of shops. Be prepared to pay for parking, either valet or the parking structure. But it is worth it. It is a lot of fun.",Glenn O

30,A shopping mall without the mall!,"I was dismayed that all there appeared to be was retail stores (many of which were franchises); bars and restaurants. I had hopes for a little more architecture, and less streets with store after store. Glad to see a little preservation of historic storefronts, just my expectations were misguided. Wish I made the effort to get to the Norton Simon museum.",Raymond O
30,Shopping you can do pretty much anywhere,I'm not really one for chains so I don't especially care if there is a Kate Spade store or a Lush place (although I like their bath bombs and have liked them since I first encountered them in Toronto in the early 90s). I was more interested in the smaller boutique places like the Goorin Bros. Hat store where my husband finally was able to get a summer hat that fit nicely. But I like things that are locally owned not corporate so it's not so much for me.,wombat1223
50,Vibrant!,Old Town Pasadena is filled with restaurants and shops. There are movie theatres too. You'll never get tired of spending an evening in Old Pasadena.,Michael B
30,For all those who can't afford Rodeo Drive; just your average mall spread out,"I visit Pasadena often from the East Coast. ""Old Pasadena"", another confection whipped up by local boosters who brought you the 1880s-early 1900s real estate lead publicity campaign to have Chicagoans and other visitors from our colder states visit and buy property in Pasadenia, also the impetus for the Rose Bowl parade spectacle, this spread out area is just so so. Best and mostly enjoyed by younger folks and foreign visitors. There are a number of affordable mid-class restaurants. One favorite of mine (but not everyone's cup of tea) is the Chado Tea Room. Barnes and Noble, one of the better ""Old Pasadena"" anchors is, unfortunately, no longer with us. The Colorado Paseo down east of the ""Old Pasadena"" central area, has also lost some of its former stores and allure. Ten blocks or so east of the ""Old Pasadena"" area is the Llaemle Theater (sometimes showing interesting films) and the one remaining Pasadena bookstore, the quite book Vroman's. Near ""Old Pasadena"" you should see the Gamble House (open Thursdays thru Sundays, apparently, check), an early 1900s mansion designed by the famous Greene brothers. Get a map from the tourist office (now moved and a bit hidden) and walk the streets and streets of early 1900s craftsmen homes, all individually built and with a sense of quiet comfort. All in all, ""Old Pasadena"" has ample eating opportunities and average shopping ones as well. Worth a couple hours, and the experience can be repeated. But this is not Florence, Rome, Vienna or Paris.",60726Nicky_11
50,Old Charm,"So many things to see and do. Lots of eateries worth trying, you can park and walk for a few blocks to get a feel for the area.

40,Los Angles and the Pasadena Rose Parade-2015,"Seeing the Rose Parade had long been on my bucket list. We decided 3 months ahead to definitely do it, and that was none too soon. We were just in time to book grandstand seats, luckily on a low row without climbing. Unfortunately, it was the coldest New Year's day since 1936, and we really bundled up. I live in New Orleans where it seldom gets this cold. We perservered though and had a great time. Tips: try to stay in Old Pasadena. It gets completely booked by the mid to end of October. Don't be dismayed by the ""motelappearance"" of the hotels. They all look this way. We stayed over in the mall, but had to visit Pasadena the day before the parade. It was a circus of people milling around that day. It was sunny and perfect for strolling and going in shops. I wanted to visit the Norton Simon museum, but by the time we walked all day, I had no more energy for it. Once there, it looked much larger than it had online and in tour books.We rode the public transit bus back and forth and discovered we were 45 minutes from our hotel. The bus system was interesting, but slow. We wished we had had a car. The parade was fabulous, but honestly, you get a better view of the floats on tv with narration of what you are seeing. One thrill was the jets that flash overhead just before the parade begins. I did enjoy every minute of it, but was glad I had met up with family who live there and took ""care of me"". I now understand why people book group tours to experience the parade. LA is just so huge, one cannot get around without a car. We moved to a different hotel to be nearer Hollywood and see more of the city, but that was a joke. We wound up being 1 hour by slow bus getting to Hollywood Blvd. and had to ride through some sketchy neighborhoods.The Getty Museum was fascinating and thrilling. It was a full day's occupation. We went by Uber and saved $ on cab fare. Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach were lots of fun with my family. I could not have done this alone and without a car.",Loretta B
50,Best local attraction,"Old Pasadena has more than just national retailers you can find in any mall. Get off Colorado and go up Raymond, Union, Green, and Holly. You will be pleasantly surprised by the variety of shops and restaurants",RickStarratt
40,interesting,Many of the shops are chains and some are unique and interesting. There a many unique places to eat and lots of fun bars. The Schoolhouse parking lot and the one on DeLacy street are free for the first 90 min and then $2 an hour. If you like to shop and eat you can stay all day. There is a Giant Apple computer store that is interesting.,Louise A
50,Great place to walk,"Tons of small locally owned restaurants, you could spend months here and not hit them all. Small place that is easy to get around walking. If you drive here there are many city parking lots that are free for the first 1 1/2 hours, then a nominal fee per hour after.",Kenton M
50,Love it!,Grat area to wine/ dine and people watch! Loved walking Colorado street and the side streets in old Pasadena.,mpn7330
40,Great for a Night Out!,"As a Pasadena resident, I love this area. I do not love the parking situation here which can be difficult, as some others here have noted. And yes, the cops love to ticket here.Here are a few of the places to try. All are within walking distance of the center of Old Town which is Colorado Blvd and Fair Oaks.Mi Piace - very good italian food. The wait for a table can be long here sometimes. I like the mussels with angel hair pasta.Cheescake Factory - very good food and awesome desserts. Also very crowded.21 Flavors (frozen yogurt) - unique yogurt shop which draws huge crowds on weekend evenings. Give it a try. Just look for the long line.Ixtapa - a Mexican Cantina. Nice to watch a game or just people watch.Salt Lounge (in Miller Alley between Colorado Blvd and Union) really nice underground lounge with some pretty good Monday Night Football specials. Not as inexpensive other times. This place is below the iPic Movie Theatre near Sushi Roku.IL Fornaio - good Italian food. This restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. My mom loves this place for any meal. Nice courtyard to sit and have coffee.Barney's Beanery - nice bar with some decent food. Good for people watching. I hope you don't need much space, because you won't have much on Friday and Saturday nights.Kings Row Gastropub - the live bands make this place attractive. I have not eaten here so I can't comment on the food. Nice beer selection here.Please note that I would have given Old Town 5 stars (or circles) instead of 4 if the parking situation were better. Plenty of parking lots but all crowded on the weekends!",JohnB00007
40,A Valuable Relic!,"Old Pasadena is a fun place to visit. There is ample, relatively inexpensive parking, up to $5.00 or $6.00 per day or by the hour, and one can indulge their palate in virtually any international taste with an abundance of choices in cafes, restaurants, tea shops, bistros and the like, and all with a lovely, almost retro feel.The town is replete with a multitude of shopping opportunities from smaller boutique-style shops to larger stores like Crate and Barrel. If one simply chooses to take in the essence of Old Town, one can simply stroll along the streets and enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of this quaint, lovely, relic of a place.It's a great way to spend an afternoon or an evening and appreciate the community's efforts in maintaining a significant piece of their history.",PAAbee
50,"Fun, fun, fun!","This is a great area. Lots and lots of restaurants, cute shops, and people. If you leave this area hungry, it's your own fault! Everything is close together and you can just hop around at will. Great way to spend an evening.",PamRug
40,Thriving downtown-old buildings with new shops,"Walking is easy but feels a little like an open air mall. They have all the expensive shops,restaurants and tourists. The parking is every where but expensive. I prefer State street in Santa Barbara. Spend your time at the City Hall, the Gamble house and the Huntington Garden area.",DianeBill
40,Interesting Urbanistic Effort,"Coming from Vienna you can’t help to feel and appreciate the effort and the pride a community takes in its being.Tranquil just on the verge of deserted on a Tuesday afternoon one still appreciates the holding on to old facades and traditional lifestyle. Lots of public buses running up and down Colorado and the upper floors apartment housing bringing back live into downtown. – There is even a modern “Old World” light rail running down to downtown L.A.The Paseo Colorado shopping district was slightly disappointing though. Shops on the ground floor and apartments above – like at home. Still the commercial level lacks landscaping, green, attractive sidewalk cafés. “New World” re-taking of the outdoors and preserving the past I have seen better here. I like what Santa Barbara did with its old main street and paseos and even Palm Desert – with no “history” at all marries shopping- and living-space with more “gemuetlichkeit”.Still, I feel some carefulness in Pasadena’s inner city projects and that makes one feel good here.",Walter S
30,Too many people,"This is the most iconic part of Pasadena. If you have never been, stop by. Lots of expensive restaurants and shops.

Don't drink Pasadena prides themselves on DUI from this part of the city. Go to Alhambra, Montrose or Monrovia where there is free parking plenty nite-life less hassle from the police. Pasadena is broke and revenuing like mad.If you insist on going go in the day and PAY for parking.Stay away from the nite-life or take a cab and say Yes sir when approached by the police. Oh ya, stay out of the dark alleys!PS. I live in the area and never go there anymore.",Ed J
30,Something Was Preserved,"The 100-plus year old buildings were preserved in the heart of the original city center, which is a good thing. But the character was taken away by chain clothing stores and restaurants and uniformly unimaginative occupiers. There are no bookshops, music venues or artist galleries, but there is a multitude of mobile phone stories and teenager clothing shops. Rather than charging onerous parking fees, the city should have had the foresight to close the streets to automobile traffic. Ask the independent entrepreneurs who are slowly, or quickly, squeezed out and they will rail against the greedy landlords, many of whom live in far away lands.",MichaelofPasadena

30,Justifiably successful urban redevelopment,"The oldest part of an old city (for southern California) that had become run-down, now once again is filled with carefully rehabbed buildings and the usual national shops and restaurants. Though it's nice to see it crowded with shoppers again (mostly young), I'm secretly glad that a few of the older businesses survive -- a pawn shop, an ""adult emporium"" (now gentrified), and an old-time bar (which gives out candy with the rest of the area's merchants at Halloween.) There are still a few unique restaurants and stores, worth seeking out, and history buffs will enjoy reading the plaques scattered in the many hidden alleys. Still, the longest lines are at the Cheesecake Factory. Need I say more?",WoodsResidents

Courtyard Marriott provided our home base and was an excellent hotel. There are so many restaurants that have virtually any kind of ethnic food you want there was no need to venture into downtown LA.

It mostly has sidewalk cafes, trendy clothes stores, and a few bars and clubs. It is one of the few remaining places in Southern California where there really is pedestrian traffic. On Saturday nights the sidewalks are crowded enough to remind you of New York or Chicago. Restaurants and parking are expensive. Some of the restaurants have terrible service and conceited attitudes, and because of that tendency, there is a high turnover of new restaurants opening, folding, or being taken over by competitors. However, given the mediocrity of much of Southern California social life, Old Town is a fun place to take a date or just hang out hoping to meet someone.",Marc B

50,Kingston Cafe,"Old Pasadena, also known as ""Old Town Pasadena"" or simply ""Old Town"", is the earliest commercial area of Pasadena and is now designated as an historical district. After a period of decline, it was revitalized with a variety of stores and restaurants for enjoyable shopping and relaxed dining. Kingston Cafe is a family-owned Jamaican restaurant located in Old Pasadena. It was voted the best Caribbean restaurant from 2009 through 2013. At a recent private reunion at the restaurant, I enjoyed the best Jamaican cuisine that I have ever experienced. It seemed to rival all of the savory dishes that I actually tasted on the island, itself, when I traveled to Jamaica some years ago. Our private reunion was served ""buffet-style"" and included Jamaican jerk chicken, jerk wings, esovitched fish, red beans and rice, sauteed vegetables, plantains, and natural lemonade. There are various dining rooms at the restaurant that can be reserved for private gatherings. Check the website (www.kingstoncafe.com) for hours of operation and other information. On-site parking is free. I look forward to returning to Old Pasadena to explore more of its charming architecture, shops, and restaurants.",Ms T B

50,What a Change!,"We remember Old Pasadena as a part of town that you did not go to visit as it was dangerous. What a delight to go there now and see the great restaurants and shops, crowds of people day and night! It is bubbling with life and a definite place to visit. Find a nearby parking garage and set off to explore blocks of interesting stores and grab a bite to eat at one of the numerous restaurants. The architecture is fascinating to check out, too.",Tricia H
50,Village like atmosphere,"We parked in a car park just by Tiffanys which gives 90 mins free parking then $2 an hour. There are lots of cafés and restaurants. The choice of shops is good too. There re older buildings mixed with newer ones. The whole area was appealing and a nice place to visit, wish we could have spent longer here.",nickyw61
40,Change of pace shopping and dining,"The combination of not-too-old restored buildings with a mix of upscale-ish shopping and good eating places warrants more time than we could give it on a hot summer day when museum hopping was our top priority. But what we saw, we liked, and have made ourselves a promise to return. You can nip down the hill from the Norton Simon Museum in a few minutes and there's ample parking available in public lots at $7 flat rate per day. For visitors it is useful to know that locals have reserved the first two floors in most lots and us out-of-towners have to schlep it from the upper floors.",Taughboyne
40,Great Shopping,"For the best experience stay at the Marriott. There are so many stores that I do not have in my hometown so this is a great experience for me. While most of the stores are well known--like Crate and Barrel. The Container Store, etc., these stores are quite large and have a larger inventory. Plenty of places to have a meal or snack or even see a movie. Try Russell's for breakfast.",Jema_T_12
50,Lots of shopping/eating options.,"Shopped and purchased at Urban Outfitters, Forever 21 and H&M. So pleasant just walking around. Would definitely recommend a stop here if staying in Pasadena.",SMSChicago
40,Old Pasadena Food Tasting Walking Tour,"Our tour had 9 different stops total, along the way our guide Nick very friendly :) and very patient ( he waited while we purchased items), would give some history or trivia of each place. Every restaurant prepared fresh foods and placed on table for us to pass around and sample within our group. Portions are nice size samples (not a meal, ex: a torta was cut into 4 pieces to be sampled by 4 people) Everything was delicious! I would recommend this tour to everyone over the age of 16 yrs. A good family outing for older children interested in trying different foods from all over the world, not for picky eaters.Tour was 3.5 hrs long with lots of sitting down breaks along the way. Only complaint its a bit pricey. Use the promo code for a discount & book before midnight or it wont let you book for same day. Enjoy!",c4fam
30,"Very Nice ""Old Town""","""Old Town"" Pasadena dates from the late 1800's and there are quite a few interesting buildings (architecture) dating from that period. Further, there is alot of interesting shopping in the old town, and dining options. The streets are nice, clean, and it is a pleasant place to spend an afternoon.That being said, I did not feel it was worth going out of my way to visit --- hence, the ""3"" star rating. If I was not already staying in Pasadena, I would have been disappointed about making a special visit just to see the town (i.e. --- my opinion of what a ""4"" stars is --- worthy of making a special visit).Now, for those that are into shopping (which I am not), this might be worthy of a special visit. Otherwise, I recommend you spend your time at the Huntington Library.",bbb57aolcom
40,Expected more history,"Old Pasedena is an extremely pleasant neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and shops, there is a wide selection of stores and all in all we spent a couple of hours soaking the place in. What was a disappointment to us was the lack of history, I expected more detail. The only sign of history we stumbled upon was a sign saying a building was built in 1888",providence

50,Depends on time of day,"Old Pasadena is very vibrant and appeals to a variety of tastes. In the day time, it's a shopping and dining attraction. In the evening, it's date night dining and movie. BUT, if you are not into the riff raff and loud youth atmosphere, AVOID it after midnight when the drunks run amok. The Pasadena Police Department maintains a presence that quickly quells any fights but they cannot be everywhere and occasionally, the nonsense spills over to innocent folks nearby. Overall, it's great so use your own judgment based on what you are willing to tolerate.",Piggy909

40,A Mall on the Street,"All the main brand stores in a few blocks!

40,Cute!,"If you are around the area and looking for a place to meet some friends for lunch and get some shopping in then Old Pasadena would be a good place to go! There are loads of shopping with stores ranging from boutiques and specialty stores to Tiffany's, H&M, Urban Outfitters, Pottery Barn, Forever 21 etc. There is a huge range of restaurants and they have quite a variety of coffee shops too such as Intelligentsia. There are alleyways that lead to more shops and other stores that make strolling around Old Town fun and quaint. However, I wouldn't make this a destination spot, but a good spot to check out if you're in the area. At night the bars get lively and is a great place for bar hopping without having to deal with lines and crowds.Parking can be a pain, but if you park in the city garages on the south side of Colorado then parking is free for the first 90 min. This does not apply to garages on the north side of Colorado. There are also tons of meter parking at the end of Colorado towards the freeway.",SeefuL

Sculptures abound, along with sidewalk cafes, a town hall looming high with a mountain backdrop. Amongst all this history are Cheesecake Factory, BJ's, antique stores, Gold Bug (great shop!), Tiffany's - you name it. This is no provincial town. There's a Tibetan/Himalayan restaurant that will knock your socks off, not only architecturally but foodie-abulous! Lots of folks who want to park your car, but you can walk easily from most hotels in the area, the Sheraton and Hilton particularly, which are close to the convention hall.

The stores also range from a Pawn Shop all they way up to Tiffany&Co. Come here with plenty of time and $$$ so you can see all the stores and have a good meal.,daniel20002

40,GOOD TO VERY GOOD - Mixed Review,"Old town Pasadena offers a great night life. For me I find the droves of people and their misguided energy a bit too much. If you are sensitive to this quality I would say if you have a specific p.o.d. for a night out in Old Town you will be fine. Old Town offers a great assortment of shops and stores. With that said -SHOPPINGBeing a self professed container freak I dearly love a trip to The Container Store, of course, located at 1 East Union. When on this excursion I must cross the street to the very funky store, “The Gold Bug” , (22 E. Union). The merchandise is truly eclectic and off the wall. After that I walk a hop, skip and a jump to Akbar Indian Restaurant, for my favorite light lunch - hot tea and their exceptionally good Chicken Kathi rolls.A favorite Old Town discovery for me last year was the well inventoried Day of the Dead store, which features many different artists. It is The Folk Tree, (217 S. Fair Oaks), and they have everything including authentic vintage religious art. I met the wonderful matriarch and owner, a well traveled woman , who is wiling to share amazing stories with you as she crafts something from behind the counter. Craving some more interesting? When you leave The Folk Tree head south to T.L. Gurley Antiques at 512 S. Fair Oaks. The crazy, year round Santa Claus mounted above the entry is what caught my eye initially and caused me to investigate further. Tim Gurley, the owner, is very well informed about his merchandise and possess unique taste in his selections unlike any other antique store around that i have found. The other thing I find highly desirable about this place, besides the lack of monotonous common items, it is not overbearingly huge - yet you will still find plenty to look at.The variety of stores is endless, so keep searching and you will find your niche.MOVIE THEATERSPasadena also possesses a nice assortment of theaters. The theater at the Paseo on Colorado is very fancy. You pay a bit more to see a film there, but I think it is worth it. It was my experience when I called the theater that an actual person answered the phone and engaged in discussion of the film I was interested in seeing. Additionally, it is located in an outdoor shopping plaza. I love art deco jewelry and have found a few nice pieces in the plaza antique store , which offers a unique service on the first Sunday of each month. An appraiser seen on a reality show called, Storage Wars"", will appraise one item at $5.00. That is a really good deal, but I do not know if there is a limit. Also off of Colorado Blvd. is The Laemle Theater, which is marvelous for those with a taste for Indie films. Vromans coffee shop / gift/ book store, is the neighbor to this theater. Movie plus shopping and a quality coffee can make a nice day of it. A third movie house on the Colorado stretch is the vintage theater, The Academy. On Wednesdays they offer a killer deal - $10 you get 2 admissions, 2 popcorns and 2 drinks. Can't beat that ! It is a good theater to catch earlier releases that you missed.RESTAURANTSThis is where my mixed review comes in. Old Town Pasadena has a plethora of them , but within the experience of my refined pallet it sorely lacks many decent ones. Yes reader, I am a food snob and make no apology. My personal mantra is whatever calories I choose to consume they will be absorbed from ultimate food gratification!Here are three restaurants I find worthy of my time and dollars:Houston's, located on Arroyo Parkway, is not only aesthetically pleasing, but employ a well trained staff to deliver their good food and meet your needs. Dining room or bar offer a mutually relaxing experience. I usually lunch at Houstons and sit in a cozy two seater booth installed across from the bar. Very nice for some intimate conversation. My choice is sharing an artichoke heart appetizer followed by a French Dip or my very favorite food, the cheeseburger. (P.S. I have awarded their cheeseburger first place!). They offer an assortment of healthier sides for your sandwich such as black beans. If you are not avoiding the french fries you will find them slender cut, browned nicely and over all very good. This is coming from someone who is not a fan of the french fry. Houstons is pricey, but they do deliver on all categories of my check list.My other recommendation for more casual dining is The Himalayan Cafe, located at 36 S. Fair Oaks. They serve delicious Nepalese food, which was a first experience with this cuisine for me. The people who run the place are beautiful spirited people.Their personas are not artificially created as an artifact of what it would be like to dine in Nepal. The amazing chef , Chudamini, (whom introduces himself as Chudi), hails from Nepal. In addition to his unique culinary skills he is a kind man who greets his tables with a genuine concern for their dining experience. The food is delicious, healthy and easier on the pocket book. They serve a nice buffet a lunch, but I have only ordered off the menu.Speaking of cheeseburgers - again - check out another review I did on Pie N. Burger, also in Old Town. It is one of the last authentic diners and the food is good. On a final note - if you are not as particular as I am about dining out then ""the world will be your oyster"" when you visit Old Town Pasadena.",Byrdie J

Plan on parking off of Fair Oaks (west side below Colorado) in the public lot at Green Street and save money. DeLacy has a second lot controlled by the City for reasonable parking. Venture in any of the restaurants, most are really good. and some great! The movie theater is expensive but unique with its food service during the movie and electric chairs- lazy boy loungers type of seating. If you walk further West on Colorado Blvd you can see very expensive new car dealers.",Todd L
50,A Great Spot for Lunch or Dinner,"Old Town Pasadena offers one a wonderful opportunity to shop and people-watch.

30,Lovely Atmosphere,"The atmosphere has history with hidden alley ways and architectural character. They do decorate the town seasonally and have specials like Restaurant Week and Art Walk in the winter and fall, plus free concerts 5 nights a week and outdoor movie venues in summer, and in the spring, they close it down to pedestrians for a huge music festival. However, with nothing but large chain stores and restaurants, with few independent restaurants and shops, it's the sameness as everywhere.City parking lots are free for the 1st 90 minutes, and flat fees after 5pm. Street parking is limited, but if you know the lesser parked streets and don't mind walking a couple of blocks - it's free after 6pm.",cjnkira

40,Old? Town,"My son was at four-day drum workshop at a Pasadena music school, so my wife and I had from 10am to 8pm each day to goof around while he was in the workshop. We spent part of that time on and around Colorado St. in Old Town Pasadena. The street is busy, there are lots of restaurants and bars to eat in, and I’m sure it’s a historic part of town, but it didn’t seem very old. When I hear ""old town"" I think of the ancient cobblestone squares in European cities.In addition to places to eat and drink, there’s a Barnes and Noble, an Office Max, Target, Starbucks, chain restaurants, basically anything you'd find in a typical shopping center just about anywhere. Your best bet is to get off Colorado and try Green St., with its smaller, cozier, less commercial feel and maybe a more accurate representation of Old Town Pasadena.Maybe it sounds like I’m knocking Old Town/Colorado St., but I’m not. Calling it old might be misleading, but we had a good time and would definitely spend time there if in Pasadena again.",sunburnt_curt

30,Not as Good as It Used To Be,"I had relatives from the midwest visiting last week and they chose to go shopping one of the days...wanting to see unique stores, they opted not to go to my local mall but to try Pasadena. (I'd taken them to a Santa Monica Promenade and Santa Barbara on previous trips).I'd been here several years ago with friends and two of my favorite stores are no longer in business here. A number of other stores were empty. We went on a weekday and parking was no problem at all. Most of the ""unique"" stores we found had prices that were ridiculous, with a simple tee shirt (yes, they were nice but...) selling for literally hundreds of dollars. I suppose I could afford it, but I would never pay that much for something that looks like it's worth $48 at MOST.We did enjoy the Container Store, but other than a few reasonably priced unique clothing stores, we did all our purchasing in chain stores that we could have found in my local mall - Crate & Barrel, Banana Republic, etc. Our age range is 40-70 and my mother especially, was not finding any clothing stores for her appeal...the Chico's had closed along with the NapaStyle store and Smith & Hawken sadly. The whole area seems much geared toward the younger set. There are lots of interesting places to eat, and we enjoyed lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.We probably missed some good stores, as things are quite spread out - we covered Colorado Blvd and side streets, Union Street and then drove to Fishbeck's Patio Center and Stats Floral looking for outdoor decor...Many of the stores have restrooms available or nearby...if you need one urgently when you arrive in the area, head to top floor of Crate & Barrel, ha. Also, we saw lots of people walking their dogs right into the clothing stores. I don't know about the restaurants. Overall, it's a nice area to go and shop a bit and have a bite to eat somewhere but if you want to powershop with a group of gals, a regular mall would be easier.",AdventurousMom63
50,Wonderful place to walk around,Old Pasadena is a first rate example of a city taking its old dilapated center of town and turning it into a first rate walking/shopping/dining area while at the same time keeping much of the original architecture of the area. The stores and restaurants (and there are quite a few restaurants) are all terrific. On weekends it gets quite crowded with people but all the vibes are good.There are several city owned parking garages with reasonable rates scattered in the area. Avoid the private lots that charge premium rates.One of the best things about Old Pasadena is that one feels absolutely safe while walking the area...even late at night (unlike Hollywood and its environs).,Rogerdob

As other reviewers have said; there are pretty much all high-end, designer name shops. And the art was very,very expensive. But the restaurants, cafes and bars seemed pretty welcoming. I had great Mexican food at ""El Toreo Cafe"" on Fair Oaks Ave. Prepare to pay for parking and walk alot. I enjoyed driving around Old Town and seeing the other historic buildings and churches, the bridge, and the surrounding neighborhoods are very ""California"" (on the other side of the bridge the homes are large with beautiful grounds.

50,Pasadena to downtown LA Convention Center,"It was a delight and surprise to find out about the Go Metro public transportation services in LA. Buy a day pass for $5 at the Del Mar Station in Pasadena and ride the Metro rail into downtown and back, and for the whole day! Buy your pass at the self service kiosks at the station platform, there are no attendants at the station. What better way to see the city. There's a catch though. You need to transfer from the Gold Line taken at Del Mar Station to the Red Line at Union Station and finally to the Blue Line at 7th St, come off at the next stop Pico and you literally walk across the street to the LA Convention Center. Allow 40 minutes for this trip. There's more, you can ride the Blue Line all the way to Long Beach and get out at the Transit Mall Station. Walk across the street and take the Red Trolley (Free) Shuttle to The legendary Queen Mary Hotel. For light travellers the Carnival Cruise Ship Long Beach Port is just next door, just walk over. It's quite a savings and pleasant trip. Shuttle taxi from LAX airport to Pasadena cost $25 pp. Note, there are attendants at Union Station checking passengers for passes or tickets.

40,There actually are pedestrians in the Los Angeles area -- here,"Old Pasadena (also called Old Town Pasadena or just Old Town) is a very good shopping and strolling area. There are hundreds of restaurants and stores. It is one of the few areas in the LA area where people actually stroll along the sidewalks instead of staying in their cars. It's a few blocks in size, small enough that you can see all of it (unless you have trouble walking), but large enough to explore again and again.And it truly was an old part of town, with dilapidated and vacant buildings that Pasadena tried for decades to rejuvenate into a shopping area. Without success until around the early or mid-1990s it suddenly became successful, and has been a major shopping destination ever since.The downsides: with popularity comes scarce parking. It's not ridiculously expensive, but there's only limited space on the street so most people will have to park in one of several parking structures. At least some of which have an idiotic policy of not letting the operator manually override the toll gate. So one day I was stuck for 12 minutes because the mechanism was stuck or the computer malfunctioned or something, and the operator couldn't get ahold of her supervisor, but couldn't let me out either. So I (and the ever-lengthening line of cars behind me) had to just sit there until the absent supervisor finally showed up. Complaints to the management about this stupid policy brought no result, so car drivers beware.The other downside is that commercial success attracted the big chains. So you'll see prominently a Cheesecake Factory, Banana Republic, Victoria's Secret, etc. etc. -- the same stores that you can go to at any mall in any US city. Thankfully there are still a good number of small and/or independent and even quirky businesses still hanging on in Old Town. Almost all of the original business have left or been driven out by higher rents, even a major movie theater, but the 35er is a near-dive bar that still persists, as does a pawn shop and even a porn shop (which did remodel itself but even so it's rather incongruous).At the west end of Old Pasadena is the splendid art collection at the Norton Simon Museum. And practically across the street from the Norton Simon is the campus of the former Ambassador College, a religiously-affiliated college with a first-class music hall, Ambassador Auditorium, which used to have a series of top classical music performances. But the church's founder died or left, the money ran out, and the college shut down and the campus sits mostly empty now. But still scrupulously maintained, and there are a few musical performances still at the Ambassador Auditorium -- not world-famous performers anymore, but the competent Pasadena Symphony has been performing there more and more often. I've never been stopped on the campus, so AFAICT you're free to stroll the ghost campus.",mkt_travel

50,Excellent walk about,"Most of the storefronts and restaurants will be familiar and you've seen them in your hometown, but there are a few unique places. Try Naga Naga Ramen on Colorado Bl for a good bowl of steaming ramen and other Japanese staples. Russell's burgers on Fair Oaks Ave has good burgers and breakfast and the 35er on Colorado Bl is a fun place to shoot pool and have a cold one. The Gold Class Cinemas are a great place to see a movie. Watching a movie in an oversized lounge chair with food and cocktail service - My kind of place! Overall Old Town is a great place to browse and walk around.",labs222
30,kikinunu,"Old Town has beautiful historic architecture. Too bad it had to be turned into a mall with all the same stores you'd get anywhere in the US. I guess thats one way to preserve history. I could just do without the ""Hooters"" franchise. If you like the predictable you'll love Old Town",Kikinunu
50,"Shopping, Dining, Entertainment","Very pedestrian friendly. Adequate parking in parking structures located throughout the area. Too many good restaurants to choose from as well as shopping, shopping, shopping. The old buildings are charming and the architecture is amazing.",MRO_13

50,The Rose of California,"Old Town Pasadena has so much charm to offer! Great eateries, quaint boutiques, fine dining, and so much more! This is a great place to bring out of town guests, first time dates, fun with family and friends. Parking is ample and don't forget to visit Green Street! (Its a one-way) Plan a day to visit this historic gem, you'll be glad you did!",Rocki C
10,I don't get it,I live here and i just don't get the whole old pasadena thing. Its the same old stores that are in a thousand malls across america with some bad local ones thrown in too boot. No good restaurants to speak of. Pretty much a lame waste of time unless you want to see store front architecture from the early 20th century which is sort of non-existent throughout the rest of LA.,Michael-and-Jose
30,This used to be so cool,"The Colorado Boulevard renaissance was so promising, and for a while, perhaps 20 years ago, the promise was fulfilled. Now, it's a mall. Some excellent pricey restaurants, but head for Rusell's on Fair Oaks for the best burgers and pie in town.",Phineas55

40,pleasurable stroll,"With the beautiful mountain back-drop we had a relaxing time taking in the sites, restaurant menus, shops, boutiques and architecture. The City Hall blew our socks off. It looks like a state capitol. I will return",2onvacaton

40,Great for dining and shopping,"A great place to shop (it was just a few days before Christmas) and countless dining choices for all budgets. Reasonably priced parking everywhere in the area. The only drawback? If you need a restroom stop, you have to visit a restaurant!",msirani
50,Who wants to be indoors in California?,"Old Pasadena is perfect for a day of shopping, people watching, and tasting a variety of cuisines to suit any age, taste and wallet.",Konstandena
30,MIXED BAG,Old Town has some good restaurants and theaters but it's very much a kiddie area. Lots of teenagers!!!!,BETTY S
40,Fun for walking around while doing some shopping at the anti mall,"if you're like me you dislike malls and crave the great outdoors (and fresh air, well mostly fresh) while doing some retail therapy. Personally I like spending at unique places selling unique things (hopefully made by a local artisan) instead of the chain stores, but Crate and Barrell is always a must on my list too. This area used to house more arty type stores and was a favorite hunting ground for me and over the years it become more commercial, but you can still find wonderful things here!",married&inlove
50,Great Shopping and Eating,Wonderful Shopping and Eating in an all american shopping experience. You can't go wrong in Old Pasadena. What a clean city. You have the best of everything. You can't go wrong. Best Chopped Salad....Green Streets,TravelnowCT

40,Great for window - or other - shopping,"Lots of fun for a coffee, some shopping, a quick bite to eat, book browsing or going to a movie.",ZurichKashew
40,"Shopping, restaurants, movie theater","People love to tell you to go to Old Town Pasadena when they find out you're visiting. There is good shopping (think Apple store, JCrew, Tiffany's), restaurants, and movie theater (ArcLight-which offers reserved seating). Parking can be difficult; look for paid parking in a garage. Once you park, you can walk to everything. Especially like Old Town during the art festivals.",Jessica A
50,"Great place to walk, dine, shop and browse","One of the great places to hang out in the Los Angeles area. Coffee shops, bookstores, great restaurants, trendy shops (Apple store, Forever 21, POP Champagne & Dessert Bar, 21 Choices Froz Yoghurt, 1810 Argentinean restaurant, Barney's pub, Gold Bug jewelry, Quadrupel Brasserie, Body Shop, Cigars by Chivas, Mignon Chocolate, Sur la Table ( I do love that shop) and so many many more. Often restaurant dining spills out onto the sidewalks and alleys. A couple blocks west is the Norton Simon museum (often seen on world wide telecasts of the annual Rose Parade) and to the east a few blocks is the Pasadena Mall area, Pasadena Convention center and the ArcLight theaters",aswessen
50,Loved it!,Charming area. Variety of restaurants. Great location.,Dawn V
30,Pleasant Shopping & Strolling for a Few Hours,"This section to the west of the main strip is notable for its architecture and restorations. There are lots of shops and eating places, and at night during nice weather there's much street life. The courtyard, 1/2 block north of Colorado, is a venue for frequent outdoor entertainment events.",Zoom_Gotti
50,Walkable shopping with hidden treasures,"We'd heard that old Pasadena was ""back"" - but it's more than that. It features a Pasadena-version of high end retail, along with local finds that make this an excellent space to spend an afternoon or whole day of shopping.",Mary K
40,Chic shops and restaurants,The old Pasadena has been revitalized and is a great place to stroll and eat.,lavonnemy
40,great stop for shopping current popular american stores,"aside from needing to pay parking (street parking), this shopping zone is a must for those needing to get some shopping who are in the pasadena area. the fact that google shows all the major stores and restaurants on its maps only makes shopping that much easier.",cloudwatchin
50,Incredibly charming walk-around district in Los Angeles,"I'm from the east coast and whenever I go to LA, I find it sort of bland, soul-less and completely without personality when it comes to community and architecture. However, this trip I encountered the Old Pasadena district of Pasadena and found a cute neighborhood filled with friendly people and particular charm. Though the main drag of Colorado Street has become populated with some of the usual corporate strip mall standards (Gap, Starbucks, Cheesecake Factory) it is off of the beaten path you can find the real sleepers. For starters, shopping on Holly Street (two blocks north of Colorado), is fantastic! There is the most stunning silver jewelry store I have ever been in called Silver Me. The owner was extremely nice and the store was so relaxing that I spent half an hour just kind of hanging out. The store owner Monica gave me a bit of free tour advise and all of her selections were excellent. First, she said I had to experience the Hey, That's Amore Coffee Shop which she claimed was responsible for the unique sense of community there. It was across the street and had palapas out front with it's very funny and engaging owner Sebastiano hanging out with customers. After making me a delicious latte, he proceeded to guide me through some of the community events he had initiated that year. The most touching of which was the letters from US soldiers in Iraq plastered all over the walls thanking him for all of the care packages he and his customers had sent. Where does that happen in LA? Then I was off to recommendation nubmer two, back across the street to Lula Mae gifts. This shop contained some of the most ecclectic gifts I had ever encountered. All unique and unusual and a collection that had been put together with love. I got my son bacon strip band aids and cute face painted marraca for my neice. Then it was off to the best reccomendation of all. La Maschera Restaurant on Fair Oaks around the corner from Holly. It was brand new and had the most incredible furniture and lighting. All of the furniture, I was later told was made by the owners father...you could tell the place was brimming with pride, so I knew the food was going to be great. It was better than that. The restaurant is also a wine bar and the staff expertly paired each of our courses with the perfect flavor selection. My girlfriend and I started with the heart of palm salad with parmesian cheese. It was served as a little brick of tangy hearts of palm with a wonderfully flavored dressing and generous servings of slice parmesian cheese. This was followed by the soup course which was a creamy carrot/ginger. Wow. Its hard to believe how excited you can get over soup, and even harder to communicate, but you have to try it to believe it. I don't even really like carrots that much, but it was spiced so well...anyway, you get the idea. The main course was the grilled lamb. It's making my mouth water thinking about it. You have to try this place! We spent an additional two hours after dinner in their wine lounge watching old movies played on the wall while we relaxed on their couches and talked. Really friendly. Great area all around. I couldn't believe I was in Southern California. So to recap, travel north up Fair Oaks 2 blocks from Colorado to get to the little community oasis. You won't be disappointed!Enjoy.Linda M.",Daydream16680
